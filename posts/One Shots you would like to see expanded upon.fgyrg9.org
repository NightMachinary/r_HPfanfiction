** The Weasley children are adopted

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12384438/1/]]

The fic explains the concept well, but I would have loved to read more about the way the family grew.

** linkao3(15239844) has an interesting premise of baby Tom Riddle being adopted by a time-travelling Bellatrix Lestrange. Usually in time-travel fics, it's one of the good guys ( Harry or Hermione) who go back in time to either kill Tom Riddle or to reform him. Therefore, it is refreshing to read a fic where baby Tom is adopted by somebody who genuinely loves him.

  History would be different if Tom Riddle had been adopted by a loving parent. Right?JK Rowling owns these characters, even the time travelers in my alternate universe.

** There are so many good ones that people have mentioned. Yours was also really good, OP. A one shot that hasn't been mentioned that I'd like to see more of would be Trial by Troll. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11106651/1/Trial-By-Troll]])

Whichever society thinks it's perfectly acceptable to have kids fight a dangerous creature as a method of determining /where one should sleep in school/ is a very different society...one that I'd like to be explored further in writing.

  The Goblet of Fire is a powerful magical artifact. Powerful enough to lock four powerful magicals to a binding magical contract even when one is unwilling. What else can it do to fulfill a contract? Pull someone to fulfill a contract from a distance? Reach across space and time? Summon the dead?

** Two of them for me. Chapter 44 of linkffn(Odd Ideas by Rorschach's Blot) and Chapter 4 of linkffn(Leicontis's Laboratory).

The first is basically Gabrielle deciding that Harry is going to be her husband, but he's far too virile for just one woman and as such will need mistresses. She also wants said mistresses to be of suitable quality and to get him trained up for her so that her first time isn't just inexperienced fumbling. Anybody that speaks French is constantly shocked at the mouth on her, but none of them will translate her lewd (and often detailed and graphic) language.

The second is one of mine, and is a Fate/Zero crossover in which the Von Einzberns got Sirius Black instead of Angra Mainyu and the Grail is thus infused with a prankster instead of an omnicidal devil-figure.
