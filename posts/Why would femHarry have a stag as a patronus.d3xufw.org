Canon Harry gets a stag because he is constantly hit over the head with how like James he is. A femHarry wouldn't be treated as James' doppelgänger so she would identify equally with both her parents, especially after first year when she is told that it was her mother's sacrifice that protects her. She would most likely have a doe or maybe even another (female) animal. Yet a lot of the femHarry AU's give her a stag and I am confused on why.


** A patronus can also be considered the embodiment of the protection one feels by the love of another.

Tonks' patronus changed to a wolf when she fell in love with Remus. Harry may have been guided to think of his father as the protector since his memories of them show James trying to hold off Voldemort, while Lily begs for him to be spared. Snape's patronus is a doe to represent Lily, as she was the only one who ever stood up for him.

*** He learns about Lily enacting a love based protection on him in first year, and the memory shows both Lily and James dying while protecting him.

***** It's an auditory memory and we hear James saying something like "run Lily, I'll hold him off" but canon (and Harry) focus a lot on Lily being given the chance to step aside but not doing so and instead begging for Harry's life and offering her own instead.

******* He meets dementors several times in book 3 and each time he hears more. He does hear James in the books.

** Not that fan fiction authors are taking this into consideration, but I believe in some mythology, probably Christian, stags and serpents are enemies. So in my head, JKR came up with Harry's patronus first then gave it James. Either way, if my memory is right about that, his patronus is as much about Voldemort as it is about James. Probably more. They're being a bit lazy, but, if she's the GWL, it fits.

*** That's actually really interesting. There's a lot of little mythological nods in the books, but I hadn't heard that one.

** Except that your typical Fem!Harry still resembles James in looks, rather than Lily. So it's entirely possible that he still gets those comments.

*** Lily's eyes and more feminine features would reduce the resemblance significantly.

*** I dimly remember one story (not very good in the end, so I haven't finished, IIRC) where instead of “looking like his father with his mother's eyes” she was “like her mother with her father's eyes” (which really put Snape into tailspin).

**** This is my default image of Fem!Harry, but it's a clear minority.

I always figured a Harry that looked that way would have Snape avoid her as much as possible due to her affecting him akin to the uncanny valley -- similar, but the eyes are "just wrong" and very offputting to him.

**** I find it unlikely that femHarry would have red hair as it is a recessive trait. Even if James had a red hair gene to pass on, it would still be a 50/50 thing.
