I just tried to go to harrypotterfanfiction.com, only to find that it closed without me knowing.... I'm very sad, as there were a few fics I only read on there. Losing them feels a little like losing a friend.


** I'm sorry but HOW COULD YOU NOT KNOW it has been everywhere on this subreddit.

*** I don't knoooooow, I sometimes come on and see a post that just makes me dive into one particular subreddit and I stay there for hours...

** Did any other site archive the fics on there?

*** The owner of HPFF actually did everything he could to prevent that from happening. Bit of a scumbag if you ask me.

Communities within the fandom have done what they could. I am active within the Dramione community and they have saved every Dramione fic that was on there. Maybe other communities have as well.

***** I have no idea, but in the last weeks leading up to the shutdown they removed the comment sections to prevent other archive sites from “advertising” and they removed the options to share and print stories to prevent readers from making pdf files of their favourite stories.

Maybe he was trying to prevent reposting by people who were not the author, I don't know. It strikes me as a scumbag move, though.

***** No sorry - but you can probably find them through dramioneasks @ tumblr. That's where I learned that they had saved them.
