Harry's animagus is a goose... so he decides to be the true son of the Marauders and prank everyone with it. Or he just goes around being a horrible goose.

***** This is what I have been wondering for sometime. If they vanish droppings then how the hell was Moaning Myrtle flushed in book 4 to the lake?

“Underwater . . .” Harry said slowly. “Myrtle . . . what lives in the lake, apart from the giant squid?” “Oh all sorts,” she said. “I sometimes go down there . . . some- times don't have any choice, if someone flushes my toilet when I'm not expecting it. . . .”

Edit: aaahaaa so it was before modern plumbing, similar to how at the court of King Francis XIV they would poop in a corner in the room in a potty. That actually makes sense. Thanks guys for enlightening me :)

***** Wizards may vanish their own droppings but goose shit is more stealthy than that. You don't see it until you step into it. Or, it looks dried on and encrusted but when you touch it it squirts everywhere. Or, it is left in such numbers that any wizard trying to vanish it risks exhausting their magic before clearing a path.

****** After long and unsukcesfull chase after Mysterious Goose, teachers stumbled upon stash of stolen objects.

The nest was regarded with considerable suspicion.

(amongst the rumors about Goose origins there were few worrying - if fantastic ones - placing the Goose as, respectively, Peeves possessing a wild bird, miraculously still living Godric Griffindor in his animagus form, Monster of Slytherin, came back to torment us all - probaby all of above at the same time as Weasley twins pointed out)

After a team of curse breakers managed to distangle the mismatched mess, found were, among other things: three shovels, a turban, 37 socks - only left ones, 5 trays with traces of treacle tart, Philosopher Stone (to the joy of Flames), the long lost Ravenclaw diadem (that almost ate a curse breaker, but that's just another day on the job), five pounds of dusty lemon drops (that somehow disappeared from the evidence) and, inexplicably, a cage with a rat who turned into a man yelling 'take me to the Azkaban, that would be a kinder fate!'

'Of course I know what Slytherin Monster is. You can stay back and relax, because I, Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin (Third Class-'

Unholy /honk/ reverberated behind Proffesors back. Lockhart was turning around when from the rafters glided white shadow. Next thing Gilderoy knew, he got face full of very heavy bird.

Goose bounced of off his head and landed with angry flapping of it's wings. It turned to Lockhart and from its beak came out long angry /hiss/.

Students, in unusual agreement, took a step back. The Goose never before bringed out sound like that. It's toothed beak and fanged tongue on full display like the thing of nightmares. First year started to cry somewhere.

Lockhart looked around frantically looking for help. He heard about the Goose. His panicky face met with unforgiving wall of students unmoving of his pledge.

No one wanted to come between Goose and it's victim.

Basilisk recoiled in the narrow corridor, trying to turn and see what made that infernal noise behind her. Her big unwieldy body trashed in small space, hitting stone walls and taking down paintings.

The rhino shenanigans are the perfect end to a complete madcap adventure, that starts when Luna kidnaps Harry at age 7 because Luna's mum told her that Harry would make a good husband.

Fair warning though, fic was written before we learn the canon name of Luna's dad, so he's named Larry in this one (If it bugs you, easiest way to "fix" it would be a Greasemonkey script forked from the XKCD Substitutions one).\\
The Horcruxes are also mostly in different locations than canon but that's not nearly as jarring.

** Harry attempts to visit Ginny at Hogwarts, but is sidelined outside of the Great Hall when he hears Slytherins talking shit about him. In an angry goose rage, Harry charges towards with intentions to bite and quack like no other goose has before, when....

Filch almost steps on him. Reeling in anger, Harry doesn't notice the pounding pouncing Mrs. Norris coming from behind.

It was over in a second. Now he stands in a pearly white train station, with only the whimperings of a lifeless, sad goose to hear.

“Fuck that.” “No, really. Fuck this. It ain't over!”

Grabbing the lifeless goose neck, he sprints into the white.. cannonballing into the impossible.

There lies a dead goose in the middle of the great hall. Some seem sad, others perplexed. Mostly people are confused how a dead goose made its way into Hogwarts.

AND THEN

The goose head rises. Mouths drop, a collective silence spreads. From what was just moments ago a dead goose, now a lifeless - literally lifeless - yet moving form rises from the pile of sad feathers.

As if waking up, the ghostly goose neck rises more. It's eerie translucency, opaque yet sleek feathers, and noiseless first waddled steps birth a scene in which shock and awe battle each other violently like there's only one piece of bread left.

When Harry finally opens his eyes... his thoughts are scattered.. but he vaguely remembers someone talking shit. He takes a deep breathe, and with toit steps, cranes his neck upwards towards the sky.

What followed went down as one of the most notorious and illustrious moments in Hogwarts history...

Part Two: coming soon.

The idea was from Discworld series, I believe 'Mort(Faust)' were the first book where Death of Rats appeared, and then was present in later stories (be it as a part of Deaths family or in cameos). Death wanted to go on vacation so he split off many little Deaths of different species to go to work and he himself posed as a farm boy x3 There was mentioned Death of Swans not Geese I think.

I personally love all of em for different reasons but most people find Rincewind books - eg two oldest in the series - quite boring. I recommend following Vimes story - Watch novels. It's about cops in the capitol city (that is kind like hot dumbster fire) and their sheningans. The ones with most Death in them are about Susan Thermopolis, Deaths grandaughter.
