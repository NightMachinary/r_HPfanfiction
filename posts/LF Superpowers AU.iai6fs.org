Are there any good superpowers AUs? I'm looking for something that preferably isn't slash, and hopefully longer than a oneshot.


** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: this world has powers and technologies ours don't have. This fic is complete and goes through all 7 years.

It has two sequels, [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-28614/DianeCastle+The+Secret+Return+of+Alex+Mack.htm#pt][The Secret Return of Alex Mack]]'s main character has true superpowers, and the Trio plays her supporting cast. [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-33141/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Swiss+Tournament.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Swiss Tournament]] continues with that world's Hermione Granger's adventure.
