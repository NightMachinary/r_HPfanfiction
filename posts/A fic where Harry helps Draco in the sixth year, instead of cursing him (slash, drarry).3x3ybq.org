Turn originally came up with the idea - in that fic, Harry is sent to an alternate world where he changed his entire life by making the decision to help Draco instead of condemning him. This could happen anytime, really... I just picked sixth year because Turn made the character development go really smoothky and thats where that author chose make the turning point.

What I'm looking for is a fic of roughly that happening - only instead of being launched into that world, I'd like for the fic to show how Draco and Harry slowly bond and start to work together.

Genres that could work for this -

- slytherin harry
- draco switching sides
- time travel
- either dark or light harry
- bonus points for any animagus topics

Thank you and appreciate any help!


** A couple of stories that I know where Harry helps Draco during 6th year are:

[[http://www.thehexfiles.net/viewstory.php?sid=7040][Harry Potter and the Bound Prince]] (I thought the characters were OOC in this but you may like it). Apparently there are a quite a few sequels to this story and the sequels were better received than the first story. [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/53034-the-bound-prince][Link]] to ratings page for the story and sequels. [[http://www.slashpervert.com/BPseriesPage/BPseries.html][Link]] for all of the other stories in the series.
