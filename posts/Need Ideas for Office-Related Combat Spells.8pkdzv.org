So in a fic I'm working on, the Ministry has sensors that set off alarms if anything other than office-related spells are cast (with the exception of certain areas). Things like paper filing and the spell that makes the paper airplane memos. What I need are ideas for spells like that, that could be used by people trying to sneak into the ministry in order to sneak in and disable/kill/render harmless anyone they come across.

I already thought of conjured ink being used to blind, but I'm struggling to think of other ideas. Any help would be much appreciated! Thank you!


** - Sticking charm for trapping opponent

- Vortex of dust- usually used to clean the carpets, but the collected trackings can be directed elsewhere

- Animations are very open-ended. Any statue, chair, or hat rack could become an ally

- un-Vanishing things can be productive if you Vanish useful substances beforehand

Also, there's much magic that can be applied using devices that would never set off a spell-sensor, like Invisibility cloaks, Shield hats, enchanted daggers, strangling coats, debilitating music boxes, and replicating walking dung-bombs (all from canon!).

** Maybe a hole-punching spell could be used to punch out a lock, or punch holes in people.

Vanishing spells are probably allowed for waste and could be put too similar use.

Silencing may be allowed and can be used to be sneaky.

They use the spell to make paper airplanes fly memos to each other, maybe that could be used on paper cutters, scissors, or other more weaponizable things. If not, maybe you could drug the paper (like anthrax or some potion) or find something really sharp that is technically paper.

** What if your characters used those spells for combat instead? (So they are bumping the spell up instead of using it as intended). Paper airplanes become projectiles. Filing becomes barriers.

They could also use the same spells on different objects. Turning paperweights into flying projectiles that can be "aimed" at the recipient.

** The paper chainsaw: nearby stationery is animated and directed at a target, administering Death By A Thousand Paper-cuts. Shows up on the sensors as a document collation spell.

** Protective Enchantment on a door or gateway (affects the "idea" of a threshold) that can do anything from make people remember other appointments or activities.

Frictionless charm - can be used on a floor to either trap or disable an opponent without hitting them. Doesn't change floors appearance, so is even more effective.

Mummification Jinx - causes the persons robs to wrap around the person and bind them tightly similar to the effect of Full-Body Bind.

Transfiguration - lots of room here, I would suggest creating small creatures like rodents and ants to infiltrate locations quickly. Possibly they are carrying some sort of potion or time-activated spell.

Disillusion objects - not sure if this is possible in canon, but you could disillusion objects to banish or hit a target without them noticing

Silencing Charms - for obvious reasons

Scorching Hand Spell - creates a bright light from caster's wand, then causes all the objects held in any person's hand within an area to heat up till it burns their hands. Conceptual, in that it works on anything a person tries or is holding when the spell is used.

*** I think you are putting the cart before the horse with you're request. The type of spells that are used depend mightily on two things: the personality/morality of the user and their objectives.

The way Mad-Eye Moody would try to infiltrate the Ministry is different from the way Mudungus would try to infiltrate the Ministry. The spells they use differ based on both the person and what they are trying to achieve.

Do the infiltrators care about being seen or heard? Do they need to leave no evidence? Is killing or maiming acceptable? Do you have one or multiple objectives, and what takes priority?

Your spell choice will depend on all of these questions and more, not to mention that particular skillset/magical ability of the individual. You can't have a 5th year student suddenly conjuring a Bengal tiger or using Fiendfyre.

**** Well, the ministry is currently staffed by death eaters and Voldemort's minister in the story. It's a team made up of 6th year Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Neville, (5th year) Luna and Dumbledore's with them. They're all a fair bit more ruthless and combat trained than they were in canon, but they definitely don't want to be caught before they meet their objective (destroying the magical sensor net over Britain).

Harry for sure in this would go for the kill, as would Hermione and Dumbledore. The others, this is basically their first mission. Leaving evidence is fine (they're in disguise) as long as they get in and out without sounding the alarm.

***** I am going to give you my honest thoughts on these ideas. You can take them with a grain of salt; its your story and I am just some loser on reddit. But here are some points I think you should consider:

1. Dumbledore's presence /immediately/ changes the nature of this question. I'm not sure how canon-like you're universe is, but to put it bluntly their is no need for stealth if he is there. What you have to understand is that truly powerful wizards like Dumbledore and Voldemort so /outclass/ everyone. They are the equivalent of tactical nukes in the magical world: the only way to stop them is with your own nuke or with a weapon equally if not more devastating. Unless Voldemort is their at the Ministry, Dumbledore can theoretically walk them through the Ministry and curb-stomp most of the forces there. This is why Rowling killed him in HBP in the first place and why Disney killed Luke in Star Wars Episode VIII; they are too powerful compared to everyone else and remove a great deal of the threat. You would be better to make Dumbledore unable to go with them or be engaged elsewhere to* ensure Voldemort is not at the Ministry building as wel*l.
2. Regarding the others. If Dumbledore is not present, then you have more of a challenge. Given their age, it is unlikely they are magically able to outmatch the more powerful members of the Ministry. They might be able to win with numbers, but they would be fools to directly engage someone in a crowded building with magic. Have them avoid direct confrontation and battle; they're likely outnumbered more than 200 to 1 or more.
3. Avoid killing. Not necessarily due to morality issues. When someone is killed it becomes far more difficult to remain concealed. If the janitor dies or goes missing for extended periods of time in the middle of the day, at a minimum their co-workers will investigate. Better for them to avoid confrontation in any form. Have your characters utilize invisibility and sound cancelling magics. Have them place protective enchantments on doorways that create a sense of discouragement or forgetfulness in anyone who walks through. When necessary, have them use low-influence charms and spells to distract people so they can sneak by. An example would be creating a warm atmosphere in a room or around an individual; the people in the room will leave or at least be distracted.
4. If necessary to take out or remove people, remember that surprise is far more potent a weapon than dueling. I gave several examples of methods you can use in this regard. Have one person reveal themselves to draw attention while others cast spells to trap the opponents (preferably while still invisible). Utilize asymmetric ways of fighting, such as creating rodents to carry potions or time-activated spells that they can take into rooms of opponents and activated there. Create traps, such as frictionless floors, protective enchantments, and strobing lights that briefly blind opponents. They are outnumbered, they don't need to play fair.
5. And finally, they need a plan of escape. Preferably something more concrete than use the floo. One possibility is have them loose a dangerous magic (ex. toxic gas from alchemy or a cursed fire) in one of the departments that draws attention away from them and clears the way.

Anyway, I hope this helps. I wanted to give you my honest opinions regarding what you described, but again you are under no responsibility to listen to anything I have to say. One thought though: if you want to understand, go look up the infiltrations in the game Assassin's Creed 2. You can get some good ideas for your scene from there, similar to what I have described.
