** Oh man, I have no idea what it was called. But I remember a fic where Dorea Black, McGonagall, and one or two others were the Muaraders of their era. James got it from his mother.

I remember the other friend worked in the Ministry records office and was murdered in the Leaky Cauldron to coverup a conspiracy she'd stumbled upon. She'd left a message only her friends could find 'I solemnly swear...' There was a shadow group behind the conspiracy and Voldemort was kinda treated as a joke. It was shaping up for the Dark Lord Harry was prophesied to defeat wasn't actually Voldy.
