I have always found the idea of using runes or symbols to cast spells or create new ones really fascinating and fun to read. I was wondering if anyone has some suggestions for stories to read that include this theme. Bonus points if this kind of magic is rare but Harry can use it or discovers it before Hogwarts (He could stumble across a book in the public library about runes while trying to figure out what his "freakishness" is). Thank you for your time (:


** Not exactly what you asked, but linkffn(the life he leads) has Harry using super-rare and awesome Nordic magic.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.
