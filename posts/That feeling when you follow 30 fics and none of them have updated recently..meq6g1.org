Don't you hate this feeling? Like there is not much you can do about this.

Sometimes I leave a comment like "I love this, keep it up" in hopes that a fic doesn't get abandoned and updates sooner, but I am sure that does almost nothing.


** I picked up an abandoned story because it got so many comments and anytime I get discouraged I go back and read them. Comments always help!

*** You're my favourite type of author then! It's a special kind of happiness when I see the update notification for a story I thought was abandoned.

I love writing detailed responses to fics because I like to imagine that it makes the author happy, and if the author responds to the comment then I'll faithfully comment on each new chapter as it updates.

** Any review is better than no review!

And truthfully, I almost never read fics anymore, I only write them. So "my" stories are always updating mentally lol. Maybe it's time for you to start writing, too!

**** Doesn't have to be perfect, just think about something you'd like to see happen and start typing. Fanfiction is easier than you'd think, since your readers already know

- the characters

- the setting

- the world

- the magic system

There, the hardest part of fiction is done! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

****** You could probably find any number of plot bunnies from other people :). It's not the same as something you yourself think of and get ideas for, of course.

** Over the years, I have hundreds, maybe about a thousand, fics that used to be updated but were abandoned for some reason or another in past. We all do, and it's always a sad thing to see lists saying things like "updated: 201X".

Some are because the authors unfortunately died; other because they just lost interest/passion.

Still always sad to see. :(

** ME!!!!!!

I'm convinced I cursed all the WIP fics I've been reading. They were updating regularly, like 1 month apart at the latest but every fic that I've read since December has stopped updating.

Like they update on schedule but when I start reading the fic never updates again for months.

Out of all the many many many WIP fics I've read since December (that weren't abandoned) only 1 has updated and that's because the fic was already finished they just needed to upload the epilogue. I almost couldn't believe it because I'm so not used to WIPs completing.

*** I started to beta-read a fic recently and then the author started to struggle with the monthly updates... Still updating eventually, though! And it's close to finishing.

** Yeah, I hate this problem. So many good fics left untouched for YEARS... I make a point of searching for completed works now, and finding series. Because then I don't have to worry about updates, since it's already done.
