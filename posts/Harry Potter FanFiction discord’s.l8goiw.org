Hey folks hope y'all having a good day. I was wondering if anybody is part of a hp fanfic Patreon (patron) or discord. I feel like I'm struggling to find a sense of fanfic community and wanted to see if any of y'all are part of anything other than this Reddit thread. ðŸŒ»


** There's one attached to this sub. There's a button in the sidebar marked 'discord' that should sign you up to it. A lot of subs will have one, I imagine. Some stories also do - I know A Place Apart by Metalduck does, for example.

** As Avalon has said ther are some dc servers for specific fics. What I know of is one for Dodging Prisons & Stealing Witches. The other is for the Pureblood Pretense series. I think both of them have sections for general fanfics too...
