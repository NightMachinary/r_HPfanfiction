** Harry potter spells are based of Latin so using the original Latin would make the spells much more powerful . No one knew about this due to warring in the past that erased this part of history or Latin overpowering the spell so much that it had to be banned. Then it was forgotten eventually and Hermione discovers it one day (due to being muggleborn and being Hermione).

Feels like an actual fic that can last

^{Or did I read this somewhere before...}

**** "Oh, that's just a bit of light reading before I go to bed..."

"Light reading? Hermione, what is that tome?"

"The tax records of Gaius Flavius, governor of Dacia."
