« Bullet dodging, Scientific American reports, is one such make-believe ability invented by Hollywood. Regardless of your speed and finesse, no human can dodge a bullet at close range. The bullet is simply traveling too fast. Even the slowest handguns shoot a bullet at 760 miles per hour, SciAm explains. »

If you can't dodge a bullet because of its speed, can you really dodge a spell. How fast does a spell travel?

A bullet travels through air at « lightning speed » thanks to the propulsion of a gun.

What is a spell? Can it be projected through the wand at the speed of a bullet? Can you link two spells to make it possible. Infuse your first spell with the force of a banishing charm thus giving it acceleration?

A spell is basically energy holding effects. Lighting is compacted energy (a lot of it) and it travels at 1/3rd of light's speed. So too fast to dodge.

What makes spells slow enough to dodge? And is there a way to accelerate a spell? Is it really possible to dodge a spell?

I'm not a physicist, I know I'm oversimplifying things but I think the basics are sound. I know magic and physics can cancel themselves, but it seems that in terms of spells' speed there is a great deal of physics involved to slow it down.


** If Dumbledore had enough time to conjure or summon a physical object to shield himself during the duel in the ministry at the end of OoTP, then we know that at least some spells move slow enough that they can be blocked. If they can be blocked, then they can also be dodged, at least on the basis of time to impact. I don't recall anything in canon stating the travel speed of spells, though I imagine there's some variance based on spell type.

*** Oh yeah I know that spells in canon can be dodged. And thank god for that, if not battles would be boring. But I'm taking it out of canon and into theoretical physics.

Energy travels (in physics) very fast, faster then a bullet. Spells are energy. Why are they slower than a bullet. I know it's magic and that's it. It doesn't answer to the laws of physics. But most of the time it defies physics to make things faster, it literally bypasses it to make things such as transfiguration possible. So why in the instances of speed of spells, it would be so heavily impacted as to make them slower than a bullet?

McGonagall transforms a matchstick into a needle instantly so the magic must have travelled very fast. Maybe it's because there's nothing magical about the object?

Why do spells in battle are slow enough to dodge? Can we assume that there is a magic force field surrounding each wizard that fights the spell progress toward them, thus making it slower ? It would be incapable of dispelling it or blocking it completely but would use the witch or wizard's magic as an opposite force?

And thus, in fanfiction, could it not be the power Voldemort knows not. The power to accelerate spells to be at least as fast as a bullet?

**** To say that a spell /is/ energy rather than /has/ energy (your original post) is a bit of a jump isn't it?

I see it like a spell is /magic/, not just a packet of energy. For example, take a flashlight. It has batteries (energy) and potentially gives off light. If I turn it on and throw it, the flashlight isn't moving at the speed of light, only the light coming out of the bulb is. The flashlight isn't moving at the sightly impeded speed of electrons, only the electrons in the circuit are. The system as a whole is only moving as fast as I threw the flashlight. And I can throw a flashlight faster or slower depending on the effort I put into it, how heavy the flashlight is, how tired I am... To me, a spell is like that. You've got this packet of magic, some packets give off visible light, and that light will travel at light speed. But the other energy it contains is restricted by the speed of the magic packet itself.

If it came down to a force field magical people are always projecting, then squibs and muggles wouldn't have any kind of protections, and there's nothing to imply that level of helplessness (that spells fly at them faster than toward wizards).

** Based upon a quick look at a few scenes from the films, spell speed seems to change to suit the narrative and drama, rather than through any sort of enforcement of magical theory. For example, in the graveyard duel, Harry's Expelliarmus appears to travel near instantaneously, while at the duelling club Snape's spell is significantly slower, such that it looks like Lockheart could have dodged.

In an absence of official spell speeds, my assumption has always been that ‘duelling' spells, such as expeliarmus, travel quite quickly, but are both visible and not instantaneous or even as fast as a bullet. At range you could dodge post-cast, and closer up wand movements may telegraph intentions, and with a verbal incantation could allow some form of half-preemptive dodging.

How this may apply to spells with effects that seem to apply instantly, such as Accio or transfiguration, I have no clue.

Overall, the conclusion to be drawn is that as far as I know there is no official guide to how spells travel. If an author wants them to be slow and dodgable, or instantaneous, or vary from spell to spell is entirely up to them, and seemingly doesn't violate film canon. As I don't have the books to hand I can't check them unfortunately.

In short, yes, given sufficient range or warning, would appear to sometimes be than answer.

As this is all conjuncture, feel free to disagree, argue, or point and laugh.

*** I wouldn't laugh. I know that it all is subjected to the author's will and thus doesn't really have an explanation.

But I like to find them. I like to rationalize it and build a little library of magical theory in my mind. I like to know why or how things happen, even in a mystical world. The most you know about it, the most you understand, the more real it feels you know?

That's why I create topics about magical theory ever so often. Like my topic about Parseltongue and how it's a blood trait carried down Slytherin's line. I was then wondering how Voldemort could keep his Parseltongue with no blood of his own. I wondered if magical traits were stored in the soul and then if splitting one's soul would affect them. If Parseltongue is in the soul, then by fracturing his soul, Voldemort would damage his ability. Then could he maybe still have access to his pieces of soul and their properties even though they weren't within himself anymore. Meaning he would have a whole soul (in abstract) as long as one of the pieces wasn't destroyed. Someone subjected that Parseltongue was a package of information (basically a dictionary) carried through blood and then implanted into the person's memory. Thus bypassing the horcruxes problem as each piece would retain the memory of Parseltongue.

Do you see what I mean by wanting to understand. Moreover, when you know how it works you can write more efficiently without contradicting canon in terms of what is possible and what is not.

I think developing canon and breaking it down into magical theory is my own form of philosophy. It's a puzzle you can solve with conjectures and reasoning. I love it.

Based on your remarks then silent casting is definitely deadly. Because there would not be sufficient warning.

**** So, i wrote out a long response but went to fact-check and as I'm on mobile it lost my answer. The main points:

I get wanting to figure out a rational system of magic.

Parseltongue in the soul seems correct, given that Harry was only a parseltongue so long as he was a horcrux. I'd probably describe my interpretation as being able to read a book of how to speak parseltongue, but not remember any of it after losing the soul fragment.

The inheritance mechanics, who knows. If it's in the soul then how does that work, if it's in the blood then Voldemort shouldn't be a parseltongue after losing his blood when he loses his body.

If all magical skills are inheritance based, how is Nymphadora Tonks a metamorphagus when as far as we know none of her recent ancestors are, certainly neither of her parents.

I'd put spell speeds down to intent. Possibly a degree of magical power, though that opens a whole other question that I don't particularly want to start up on.

***** Well Teddy Lupin is a metamorphmagus so it is hereditary. It probably comes from her Black heritage but skipped generation until it was introduced to “new blood” such as the Muggleborn blood of Ted Tonks.

Plus in Cursed Child (which according to Rowling is canon) Harry has retained the ability to speak Parseltongue so it was not soul based. It's probably memory based. Harry had the ability since infancy so it makes sense that after living with it for so long he wouldn't lose the knowledge of how to speak it when the horcrux was destroyed.

****** Take into your considerations that in Book 7, Ron also opens the Chamber of Secrets to get basilisk fangs just y remembering and copying what he heard Harry say. That doesnt necessarily break the "hereditary" theory, but does show that there probably is a mental, memory-based aspect to it as well.

******* I agree with you and that's the conclusion we came to when wondering about Parseltongue.

Ron will never be able to be a proper Parseltongue because he may be able to reproduce sounds but he won't be able to understand or create new ones. If you'd asked him to say door he would not know how.

Voldemort probably got his ability through blood and it affected his mind/and memory. Even with a tiny piece of soul, even with no blood and no body, he could access it because he remembered it.

It created pathways in his mind, it gave him lexical knowledge, made his mind capable of translating the sounds into his own language instantly. That can't be taken away.

I learned English and there's a few chance for me to forget the language after using it for most of my life.

To me the ability is implanted by magic in the mind of someone. The magic would be blood-oriented, meaning it would only transfer to blood-kin.

For Harry, the knowledge must have come from the piece of soul, it might have automatically created the lexicon and pathways in Harry's mind that would not be destroyed after its departure.

******** Actually that's a point I never really thought about. Harry does speak Parseltongue, but as far as I know, he never speaks it without reason. I'm fairly certain that if you asked Voldemort to say "Make me a tuna fish sandwich," he could say it fine. Every time Harry speaks it, however, it's either in a time of need or totally accidental (a.k.a. the snake in book 1). Does Harry actually speak Parseltongue fluently, or is it again only able to come to him at time when he needs it or doesn't know he's speaking it?

To be fair, I haven't read Cursed Child, so if the answer to this question is in there, I wouldn't know.

********* I started Cursed Child but soon got bored and disappointed. But I know from Harry Potter Wiki that Harry used it in it. Apparently he thought the ability was gone and never tried to speak it after the war, but it wasn't.

The way I see it, Harry never saw the point to use it. It was labeled as a dark ability and Harry wanted to be normal. He was in Gryffindor and not particularly interested in snakes.

Voldemort however had a snake familiar to which he spoke all the time. It stands to reason that he would do it with much more ease by practicing so much.

We learn later that Nagini was a Maledictus which means that before being a snake, she was human. She's probably more intelligent than the average snake and can hold a conversation. It would then be an incentive for Voldemort to use it. It was also the proof that he was of the Slytherin's bloodline and a great tool of intimidation.

To Harry it was nothing more that something that made him yet more similar to Voldemort, a parting gift from him after having killed his parents and a dark ability to boot. When he used it in the zoo, he was more talking to himself than to the snake. He was bored and lonely --- so he spoke to a snake without intending to have a conversation, he was trying to vent. What would most snake have to say? Probably things like “Hungry, cold, mate, eggs”

I also think it's an interesting point to think about whether or not Harry actually said the sentences to the Brazillian Snake in Book/Movie 1 or if we are seeing his version of it and the snake only heard broken up Parseltongue with English mixed in.

I will say, [[/u/OliverBellwood]], you have definitely made me think more in depth about the series than I have recently. Thanks for that! Maybe I should re-read the books/listen to the audiobooks and purposely try to think about things from a different angle than I'm used to.

*** I can see why it's your theory but then what about shields? How could you conjure a shield to defect a spell fast enough not to be hit with it? How would you know what type of shield to use if you didn't know what spell is going to be used?The killing spell for exemple can only be deflected by solid objects

There is the matter of silent casting. If you don't know what spell is used, you can't use a shield.

The answer would be to use the color of the spell to know what was sent at you but then it would be too late, wouldn't it? If you see color then it is already speeding toward you and will hit you no matter what.

« EXPELLIARMUS! » « PROTEGO! » --- the shield will stop the disarming spell even if it was cast a second later (probably because it doesn't have to travel far from the caster). But in close range no matter how fast the shield is cast, the spell would have already hit.

We can only assume that spells don't travel as fast as a bullet and that it is slow enough for you to see it coming, identify it and give you time to dodge or raise a shield.

** The first thing to do is to define what dodge means in your mind. The reason you can't dodge a bullet is if you take a definition of dodge where you /see/ the bullet, figure out where it's going, and move out of the way - and we're just not fast enough for that.

However, you /can/ evade a shot - but preemptively (eg, anticipating where the shot will be, erratic movement, taking cover, etc). That's how most of the fics I've read discuss 'dodging' spells - it's in the proactive movements ahead of them being shot.

However, the question of dodging a spell is one that's an interesting one. I think it depends - some spells will be slow enough projectiles to be able to be dodged, while others might not - but all of them will have at least /some/ build up. In many cases that's the wand movements or the verbal incantations - or if the wizard/witch is skilled enough (eg, Dumbledore or Voldemort) I would think that there would be a way to know what a spell is being used without verbal cues or major wand motions.

I would say that the interpretation of how much of the reaction/countering of spells comes from the time while they're being cast, and how much from the time they're in the air (ie, able to be dodged) is left up to the writer.

** A bullet does not travel at lightning speed. It travels at about the speed of sound, more depending on the type of gun. (an assault rifle bullet moves much faster, for example).

The effect of a spell is usually contained within a jet that exudes various visual cues, such as color (the red of a stunner, or the green of the killing curse), inner shape (In the first movie, the fire spell cast by Hagrid takes the form of a double helix), and speed. Some spells are instant, and some move very fast. The why is probably covered in magical theory, so we know nothing about it.

The spells which are shown, though, are rather slow - the stunner takes a second or so to cross a room, as do many other battle spells. The wand movement and the incantation would be early cues as well, much like how you should dive out of the way when someone lifts the gun, instead of when you hear the bang.

Im essence, while you might be dodging the spell, you're really dodging the spell you think he's going to send.

some fics I've read have all spells move at the same or similar pace, others have them move differently depending on the spell. some give spells effective ranges after which the spell sort of fizzles out like a spark being extinguished. I read one where someone interspersed slow moving spells and then finished a type of spell net being banished behind the spells catching them up and pushing them forward faster.

since there's so little about spell mechanics in cannon it's really up to you/the author how they want them to interact. I mean the basics of dodging spells would be the same as dodging bullets or arrows, just don't be where the wand/gun/bow is aimed when it's fired is the best plan, anything else is pretty much pure luck.

Personally I do think that spell mechanics are an interesting area. in the hope of 'balance' i do think spells should move at different speeds. even bullets have different muzzle velocities, based on a combination of calibre, charge size, barrel length, and some other less impactful stuff. not just strong spells move slow, weak spells move fast, but based on the spell itself, how the effects happen, what the effects are.

a color changing spell would move fast, minor change but color change spreads rapidly from point of spell impact.

Imperius is instantaneous, but you have to overpower the target's will so it may take some time to have control so your spell can't be broken but it begins the process immediately.

Sectumsempra- quick, but very short range. the slice stretches as it travels and so at a point it would be a very long very shallow scratch, approx 40-50m it becomes like a light caress, or like someone dragging a test tube over your skin.

killing curse. fast, more akin to a bow, so like 200-250 fps (60-75 m/s) medium range, max 100 meters but it is a very precise, very small spell so it's easy to miss even at 25-30m

a freezing spell will move slower than most spells and effective distance depends on the ambient temperature.

Fire spells can move quickly but with limited range, like it consumes all the oxygen very quickly and then extinguishes itself, or more slowly over longer distance.

tbh backstory details and lore is what I love about fantasy stories so I could probably go on for hours on the basic mechanics of magic and spell interactions in my head cannon, so I'll stop at this wall.

*** Thanks for your reply. Yes I seem to have given “fend” a meaning it doesn't have. I honestly don't know where it came from, it just made sense in my head.

The material component of a spell would give it weight, the energy part would however prevent you from weighing it (shame). That would also mean that it is possible to accelerate a spell by feeding it more energy to prevent it from being slowed down by the air.

So you assume that a spell would dissipate at some point? That a sectumsempra would be inefficient if it hit someone from too far. That would mean that it ran out of energy and thus would prevent the effects from taking hold. That would make sense.

Spells can't be too fast because then it doesn't give you time to react. You could dodge every spell but it would be tiring and inefficient and it would render shields useless.

The killing spell seems too fast, you wouldn't have time to conjure a slab of marble to deflect it.

If spells are too fast you can't identify them and then decide if you use a shield or if you dodge. Silent casting would make spells deadly. You can't figure what is cast. You can only dodge. If you try to identify it by color then it's too late because it would have already reached you by the time you decide what to do.

You just have to stand by the side of the road and look at the cars. You could barely dodge or deflect with a shield something coming at you at 40mph.

But yes I love discussing mechanics of magic and magical theory, that just gives more flesh to this magical world we all love. Plus it's an interesting exercise to use the facts of canon to build valid theories.

exactly. fight the person not their weapons. boxer's don't react to the fist moving, they react to the opponent's core and shoulders. baseball players regularly hit ~100mph fastballs from 60 feet away.

you react to your opponent starting to cast. some spells take longer to cast, a longer incantation or the need to summon more will or energy. Also this is where Legilimency and occlumency helps even with silent casting you're thinking very hard about all these different spells so if someone can read that they can react to the spells before the cast is started and occlumency prevents people from reading you, even at a very passive level you can at the least sense when they decide to start casting a new spell. but reminder this is still happening while still throwing spells at each other and moving.

Just saying “spells are slower than bullets” is insufficient. It's like you asked me why the sea moves and I answered “it just does”. This is not a fulfilling answer.

I'm reading everyone theories about the speed of spells to form my own and then incorporate it into my writing.

In canon, Occlumency is the art of “clearing your mind”. In fanon, writers developed the concept of mindscape, mental barriers, thoughts-sorting. Fanon created the Noble and Ancient Houses, Heirs and Lords, it created Parselmagic, it made wandless magic possible, it gave us an insight of how Gringotts operated...

Class at Hogwarts would be boring if everything was explained by “It's magic” or “It just does/is”

** I personally, judging from films, view spells as traveling energy that emits light. Personally, I think that spells are too fast to dodge and maintain the ability to react. I think it is also too unreliable compared to shielding. You have to move your whole body and being clipped with a killing curse is death. They're slower than bullets but also nothing to play dodgeball with. It's one thing to conjure something in the path of something but it is entirely another thing to hurl yourself out of the way, and be in a position to respond to the next few spells.

I think that dodging would be limited to the schoolyard duels of children where spells are cast slowly and verbally. Dodging explosive spells and killing curses would be very risky when you could simply dodge, summon something into its path, or conjure. An explosive spell could still harm you even if you dodge it whereas a shield would negate it.

The issue with magic and physics is that you can in someone explain the result but not the cause of it.

The main issue would likely be the conservation of energy, if you would transfigure something you would create particles (which would mean that you somehow either "create" energy or converted it) which decay after the transfiguration ends or is canceled (which would have a far more interesting effect than your turtle turning back into a hat) that would have to go somewhere or you "destroy" energy.

** I think of spells like a major league fastball. About a 100mph give or take. In the close quarters most wizard battles seem to happen, it's possible to dodge but you need to really be aware and agile.

** If the person casting the spell yells it or the wand movement is pretty obvious it should be easy enough to dodge. You don't even have to know the specific spell. Protego is a simple straight line so you could simply cast it as soon as you notice the other person doing something. Might be harder with non verbal and/or wandless magic. Then there's people like Snape or Voldemort or Queenie who can use Legilimency while fighting, making it a lot easier for them to dodge spells.

I also think that you can dodge a bullet by getting out of the way as soon as you see the gun. When the other person has already pulled the trigger it's too late.

** Magic is not based on physical laws but rather on the perceptions of the caster. Therefore, in my headcanon, the speed of spells is completely dependent on the speed visualized/imagined by the caster.

*** That would make sense if not for Voldemort missing Harry or Dumbledore while fighting.

If Voldemort imagined Harry struck with the killing curse as soon as the incantation left his lips (? does he have those), then Harry wouldn't have had the time to dodge behind a tombstone.

I can concede some of the speed to the caster. But spells were designed so it would make sense that some of the components of the spell, such as the power it needs, the effects it holds, the wand movement would have an impact on its speed. Perhaps if some spell were revised by changing the wand movement to a more efficient one (perhaps shorter), it would increase the speed of the spell? Who knows?

A carriage and a car have the same utility, put the car is stronger and more efficient. Perhaps it's the same with spell. A spell would work just fine with its original incantation and wand movements but it would be able to refine it to make it faster and stronger. Just think about a stupefy that could only be lifted by the caster, that's useful (and dangerous but useful). Or a stupefy that struck as soon as it is cast.

**** No, I mean visualizing every point of the path of the spell. Try visualizing yourself running - the faster you go, the less clear the 'movie', or at least it is for me. At some point it becomes more like a series of photographs and less a smooth transition. It is of course easier with simple streams of light, but the need to be able to clearly and quickly visualize every point of the path sets a limit to how fast a spell can be.

** *Harry Potter and the Stargate* linkffn(13052799) goes into this big time. He thinks spells are fast until he has to go against energy weapons for a bit and his assumption is corrected. It's all about intent.

  What if Remus was not... quite... as fast as he needed to be to catch Harry before he tried to get to Sirius in front of the Veil of Death. And what if the Veil was not what the magicals believed it to be? Oops! AU HP/LL Bash!AD/RW/GW (as my usual).
