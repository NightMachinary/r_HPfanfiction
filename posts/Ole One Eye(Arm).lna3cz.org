So I read a fanfic a few months ago. But I can't remember the name atm. But the Mc is a self insert and is supposed to have a lot of subtle similarities to Odin until he finally makes the connection and becomes a god later. But my thing is he loses an eye in the story and it's always seemed badass to me.

Another where Harry loses an arm and refuses a magical prosthetic for some reason. It just makes the fight scenes more badass to me. I mean fighting someone metaphorically with an arm behind your back vs not having one just hits different.

So requesting any fics with something like that. Either where harry is born like that or loses it somehow. Whether an arm or eye etc IDC. Even like that one fic where he lost his sight because of the first killing curse but could see magic. I'm down with it. Any fics come to mind?


** Can someone tell me the title of the two fics he described?

*** I'll look up the first one because it's more recent but the second one was a long time ago I can't remember. Also the first one kinda ruined its own ending.
