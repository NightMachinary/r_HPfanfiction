Specifically stories where Harry becomes a professor or assistant professor while he is still in Hogwarts.

I read a one-shot with a sequel where there is a section on exams where students write who taught them for their owls and many put Harry down due to the DA. He ended up getting paid instead of Umbridge, and the sequel has him becoming the DADA professor despite him still having classes. linkffn(Renumeration for Instructional Services by Stephen Ratliff)


** Rise of the Alpha series linkffn(6389117). It is long, starting from book 1. It has a supercharged DA, with Harry training up the entire school by the end, although he is not a formal (paid) teacher.

** He teaches an advanced Defence against the Dark arts course because he knocked up his DADA professor in Blood of The Phoenix. He winds up as the potions professor in Delenda Est, in that one he's banging Bellatrix Black and wishes he could be the DADA professor but he's still a good teacher. In 0800-Rent-A-Hero people are a bunch of assholes so Harry teaches Divination in an alternate dimension where there's a girl-who-lived instead, but he doesn't fuck her, his romantic interest in that story is actually a spoiler better not say anymore. Also, there's Harry Potter and the Last Chance, he dates Hermione in that one but I don't think they have sex but he takes over the prefect position because Ron's too busy banging Lavender and all the first years call him Professor Potter.

  Harry signs up for more than he bargains for when he agrees to mentor Luna through her seventh year at Hogwarts While also teaching Defense against the Dark Arts. Together, they fight bigotry and corruption, while Luna learns what it means to Feel, and Love. Luna sets out to fulfill her mothers work and change the world as we know it forever...that is if she can live long enough!
