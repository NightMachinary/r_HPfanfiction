Most of the "Reading of" Fics are awful. I especially can't stand "Reading of" Someone else's fic. That's just "Let's be lazy and review a fic, in the guise of a character doing it" There's one or two good ones, but they're still mostly Copy Paste chunks from the book and write a few lines about it.

What i want is where Harry, and preferably JUST Harry finds the Harry Potter series, and uses them as foreknowledge. He reads ahead in Book 1 and finds out Quirrel is the one after the stone and not Snape, that sort of thing. Basically a Time Travel fic without the OP abilities of having all of your spell and theory knowledge, and just precognition (using the books)
