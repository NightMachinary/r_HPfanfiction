What would happen if a muggle born witch born to two famous parents got accepted to Hogwarts and her parents got explained on the school , do you think this idea works and how would it work


** Well, Justin Finch-Fletchley was supposed to go to Eton, and he would be one year ahead of Prince William.

Hogwarts and Ministry of Magic have ways of manipulating paperworks in the Muggle world. Plenty of real world celebrities are trying to keep the lives of their children secret, both for privacy and security concerns. So I don't think your case would be much of a problem.

*** While the "childhood" is easy, I am more concerned for the latter years.

For example with Justin Finch-Fletchley, his family is rich, and he was supposed to go to Eton. While the parents can say he went to another school, what would happen, later, when none of the kids who went to posh school know about him? And how to justify all of his disapearance (going to magical world)?

I wonder if the celebrity kid don't end up having "accidents" to just disapear from muggle world.
