For someone who started reading fanfiction just days ago (I read the HP books as they were released, back when I was in middle school, now I'm 26), the imagery of characters from films is ingrained in my mind. I know Hermione doesn't look like Emma watson at all and Fenrir Greyback is supposed to be more wolf-like. I really want to reach a stage where I am able to make my own visual imagery of the characters independent from books.


** Hermione is definitely not Emma Watson from later movies. She should look like [[https://i.pinimg.com/736x/a6/f0/fa/a6f0fa6ca9d09eb4fa13b25a2f1542fa--helena-bonham-carter-gender-roles.jpg][Helena Bonham-Carter in A Room With a View]]

** My headcanon Snape doesn't look like Alan Rickman - the man was brilliant but too old and nowhere near greasy enough. He looks like [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/hpsnapesnoopin-fullsize-mk-200x0-c-default.jpg][this image]] of him hearing the prophecy. Young, with lank greasy hair forming curtains, a long pointy nose, sallow slightly olive skin and very dark irises. Yellow, crowded teeth.

He has Alan Rickman's voice though.

Physically, my headcanon HP is Daniel Radcliffe but with bright green eyes, cheap NHS specs and very messy hair that sticks out at all angles and is slightly too long.

Hermione was described as beautiful once her buck teeth were shrunk, but prior to then, well, she's all teeth and frizz and a nagging, too-loud voice. After then, she's easier to see as conventionally attractive - if she'd only do something about the hair and the mother-hen attitude. She doesn't look like Emma Thompson to me, and her hair is a lot more chestnut. Technically she could look partly black, and I never object if she's described that way in fanfic since the writing doesn't preclude it, but my head version looks like my own picture of a know-it-all bossy schoolgirl. With buck teeth and frizzy hair added. She's white with a few freckles across the nose but not so many they define her at all.

Luna Lovegood in /behaviour/ is as the film, as the actress got that spot on from the books. The accent doesn't seem right, she should sound Devon or RP, not Irish. And she is described as having buggy-out pale blue eyes and dirty blond hair that hangs raggedly - not pretty at all really.

Ginny is very round-faced to me, with wavy hair or curly red hair and a slight tendency to dandelion clock. She has a merry face and roundish cheeks and is not as pale and flat-faced as the actress that plays her. More arresting and engaging in appearance - Harry noticed her right away and his eyes stayed on her a lot, and she's described well and a /lot/ more than other background characters. So something about her draws the eye. Ginny from the films is too 'everygirl'. Bill Weasley is a bit lank and lacklustre too.

Arthur and Molly are spot on. Remus Lupin looks like a worn-out 40-year-old version of Gareth Hunt with greying hair. Older than he is, but not Alan Rickman old.

No she wasn't. She was described so at the Yule Ball, likely because she had a dress on, makeup, her hair all done, etc. and that was really it. Harry didn't even notice her teeth until it was pointed out for him.

** This is one thing I feel very strongly about. More than magical cores, more than Muggle-style wizarding attire, and even more than movie-style spell light. Movie likenesses turn me off big time, and I concede that it's mostly an irrational aversion, but it is what it is. If I can feel them peeking out through the prose, I tend to nope out. Like Harry having blue eyes and being five foot five, for example.

I sometimes wonder how people visualise the characters when they're reading my fics, too, but how others perceive them isn't really my business.

** I'm very much influenced by the two first movies, and the young versions of Harry, Hermione and Ron (as well as the early movies' Flitwick, Hagrid, Ollivanders, Quirrell, Voldemort and Aragog --- plus Maggie Smith's McGongall if I overlook the grey hair) are permanently etched in my brain. However, later characters (as well as the way the kids grow) are more separate from their movie-selves in my mind (Slughorn is similar to the films but keeps his mustache, for instance, Umbridge is much uglier though she sounds and acts like her movie self). Moreover, completely separate of the movies, [[http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Z96a3S2voAU/VintNPNKYcI/AAAAAAAADoU/tH5NWM4-9iQ/s1600/Cornelius%2BFudge.jpg][this is Fudge]], [[https://img00.deviantart.net/ff71/i/2017/198/d/d/harry_potter_creature_feature_1__house_elf_by_scroogemacduck-dbgnglo.jpg][this is Dobby]], and [[https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6d/0f/bf/6d0fbf2f610235f6595d702fde64cc8b.jpg][this is Dumbledore]]. Snape is a bit of a special case; his appearance isn't far from the movies' version (just a slightly pontier nose; [[https://i.pinimg.com/236x/eb/17/57/eb1757a043f7c24efba99f019df01630--harry-potter-cartoon-harry-potter-art.jpg][essentially like this]]...), but I see him as /acting/ completely differently --- with large swooping motions and a much less deep voice.

Oh, and of course, Grindelwald looks and sounds nothing like that Johnny Depp abomination. [[https://img00.deviantart.net/2b43/i/2007/215/4/f/hp_grindelwald_quickie_by_homarusrex.jpg][THIS]] is Grindelwald, thank you very much.

** Most of the major characters are a blend of my own vague idea of them and fan art that's crossed my path and left an impression. The movies don't enter into it at all, and I get annoyed when it's clear that fic writers are describing the actors.

The way fan artists portray the characters, especially Snape, is endlessly interesting, and some of their interpretations have rubbed off on me. When I'm writing, though, I'm very focused on my own versions, although they change a little depending on what story I'm telling. I have different Snapes based on what slant the story takes.

Here's a version of young Snape I love and think is canon-compliant (except his skin should be yellower), at the moment he reports the prophecy to Voldemort. For once, he actually looks his age. He's thin and greasy-haired and very proud of himself, and he has a starry-eyed expression of trust in Voldemort.
