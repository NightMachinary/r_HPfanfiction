Chapter 1

A beginning

Caramella Thompson was an ordinary child the day she woke up. A witch, like all of her relatives, so ordinary in her eyes. She was an 11 year old child from Bristol.

"Dad has been making breakfast" Caramella thought when she smelled the odor of freshly cooked bacon.

"Hurry up Caramella and Austin" yelled her mother from the citchen.

“Oh yes and Jenny too of course!” their father yelled Her brother Austin, sister Jenny and her dragged themselfes downstairs to the citchen where their parent's waited with smiles on their faces.

"You know what day is it?" Bartholomew asked seeming quite happy. He was rarely that happy since he and her wife Sophie had inherited the family wax eporium and he had been very stressed lately.

"We're going to Diagon Alley today kids!" mom said after Austin and Caramella didn't reply.

"Oh yeah dad, i need a new caldroun, mine blew up last year”.

“Didn't you put fireworks in it with Fred and George Weasley and set the common room on fire?” Caramella asked amused.

“ We most certainly did not get information of this event Austin!” Bartholomew informed Austin.

“It's because we didn't get caught, the fire wasn't that big and we extinquished it easily” Austin answered quite nerviously.

“Fred,George,Austin and Lee might be rascals but they still are quite talented and smart” Jenny replied while checking through the daily prophet. “Thank you sis!” Austin replied looking glad.

“Well eat your breakfast, we'll be leaving in an hour” Father said, took off his apron made by Jenny on her first year of hogwarts. It was the 1st of august and Caramella was getting a little nervious. She was going to leave for her first year of Hogwarts. Her 15 year old sister, Jenny was allready going the 5th year and Austin for his 3rd . Maybe his brother wasn't the “model student” he still was a talented wizard. When she left the table and went upstairs to put on her normal clothes she couldn't stop thinking, thinking about last year. Austin and Jenny had told that he who must not be named would have been in hogwarts. And about Harry Potter, the boy who had defeated “he who must not be named” as a baby and as an 11 year old like her. She in the other hand had not achieved a thing, as a baby or as an 11 years old. What if she'd be expelled or what if “he who shall not be named” would come back to hogwarts and she'd die!

Then her older sister Jenny walked in her room and asked

“Are you okay?”. Caramella just nodded.

“I was really nervious when I left for my first year too you know” “Remember when Austin cried at the plattform two years ago when he didn't want to go?” Jenny said ammused.

“And! I have a surprise for you!” Jenny said and gave her a cardboard box. The box was heavy and she felt there was something moving inside of it. She opened the lid and she saw a tiny cream coloured kitten.

“Do you like it?” Jenny asked.

“I reallly do! It's so cute!”. “In Hogwarts I and Austin won't always be there for you! I thought that if you'd have a cat you wouldn't feel so lonely”.

“I love it, thank you Jenny”. Caramella felt a lot better allready, she knew she wouldn't be that lonely. She really loved cats, her neighbor had a cat and it liked Caramella a lot.

“It's time to go!” Bartholomew shouted from downstairs. They went to the car, their Toyota corolla shined on the driveway. They entered the car and Bart started driving.

#+begin_example
  On the radio was Bohemian rhapsody. Caramella thought about Freddie Mercury, the man who was singing in the radio. He had died years earlier. Death was in her mind and it seemed to be everywhere. When they finally reached London they got stuck in a traffic. Then Bartholomew said  
#+end_example

“Hold on kids, I have a trick up my sleeve”. The car flew straight up for what felt like a minute.

“Welp we're here!” Bartholomew said.

“What the devil was that?” Austin asked amazed. “That my dear fellas is magic”. Caramella was amazed to see that their car was indeed parked infront of the leaky cauldron. They exited the car and entered the leaky cauldron.

“Oh damn there's Fred and George! Can I go?” Austin pled from his parents.

“Sure, but don't blow anything up!” Mom said.

“I'll try my best mom, thank you!” Austin left to meet Fred and George.

“Well, do you need anything Jenny?” Mom asked Jenny.

“Only the new books, oh and could I get new robes? Austins fireworks kind of blew up my last year's robes?” Jenny replied.

“Of course! Here's seventeen galleons for you. Get some candy for you and your siblings” Bartholomew said and gave her daughter seventeen golden coins.

“Well Caramella, let's get your stuff. I believe you allready got your cat” Mom said picking cat hair from Caramella's shoulders.

“Do you have the letter dear?” mom asked.

“Of course! I believe I'd want my robes first” Caramella said while glancing upon the new Nimbus 3000.

“Sure, I bet that one sells robes” Mom said and dragged Caramella away from the broom. The first sweater and robes she tried on fitted perfectly. She thanked the shopkeeper and left the shop.

“Wand” She said right away when she saw the Olliwanders wand store. When walking over tot the wand shop she bumped into something. It was a boy, a boy who's books and camera she had just bumped over.

“Oh, im so sorry” Caramella said and started picking up the books.

“It's okay, oh you're going for your first year of Hogwarts too! I'm Colin Creevey! ”

“Awesome, I'm Caramella Thompson!”

“Brilliant! Can i take a picture?” Caramella nodded and she was blinded by the flash that came from the gigantic flash on Colin's camera.

“Well I guess I'll see you there, bye”

“Bye”

“What a nice boy, it sometimes seems that no one has manners anymore, glad that it's not true” Mom said with a glad expression on her face.

“Well yes wand indeed” Caramella said glancing behind her back trying to see where Colin had gone. She stepped into Ollivanders. Olliwander was standing behind his desk and said

“Ah, Bartholomew 11½ inches chestnut dragon heartstring?”

“Indeed” Bartholomew answered and lifted his wand from his pocket.

“Sophie, let me think, let me think, 12 inches, Hawthorn, Phoenix feather core?”

“You're not a person who forgets things are you mr. Olliwander?” Sophia said spinning her wand in her hands.

“Oh no Sophie dear, I sometimes don't remember my name, but I do remember every wand I have sold over my many years in the business” Mr. Ollivanders said.

“And this must be Caramella?” Caramella nodded. She couldn't get her eyes off all the wands there. She thought who had boxed all these wands. It must have been a boring job.

“Well ms. Thompson, i believe i have the wand for you. Olliwanders took seven boxes off the shelf and gave a wand from one of them to Caramella. Caramella took a swing, the wand's tip started glowing and some golden stuff came out. “Excellent, excellent indeed. That would be seven galleons”

“Thank you Mr. Olliwander, here you go” Sophie said and gave Olliwander seven golden coins. While walking down Diagon alley Caramella was admiring her new wand. On the lid of the box it said

“Birch

10 ¾ inches

Hippocampus heartstring”

in a beautiful handwriting and gilded letters.

She was proud about her new wand and she couldn't get her eyes off it.

After walking down the alley for a while they stopped infront of the book store. There they saw the Weasleys and Grangers. “Oh Bart, howdy hey” Said Reginald Denver, A friend of Bartholomew.

“Hello, isn't Sophie allready on her second year?” Asked Bartholomew from Reginald.

“Yes, yes indeed. How are you Caramella?” “I'm doing great uncle Reg, how about you?”

“Brilliant, but the new defense against dark arts books are bloody expensive, who does that Gilderoy Lockhart think he is!” Reginald answered, he seemed quite annoyed over the prices of the books.

“Money problems Reginald?” Said Lucius Malfoy.

Just before Lucius had said that, a friend of Bartholomew, Kevin O'Brien had walked in to the store with his family

“Oye, fuck off! Well walk away, or I'll punch you in the face, remember when I did that twelve years back”. Kevin, Bart and Reginald had been best friends back since they were in Hogwarts in the year 1978. The men didn't do or say anything but Caramella saw from their expressions that the would have all enjoyed stabbing each other to death.

“Ah Kevin, always as discreet. I guess it's an Ireland thing aye”

“You and your white noseless man loving pals can just go” Reginald said followed by a few seconds of silence.

“Go where Reginald?”.

“I'd rather not say, since there are children present”.

“Well I guess I'll see you around then” Lucius said.

“Arthur has a new car, I hope we'll “bump” into each other some day” Said Kevin with the same murderous face.

“Oh hello Arthur”

“Hi” Arthur responded. Then he bumped into Lucius and they started talking. Caramella wen't and got her books, on the way to the door they saw Lucius and Arthur in the ground.

“Blimey. A fight!” Kevin said.

“Yeah Arthur, kick his ass” Jenny yelled cheering Arthur on.

“Mind your language young woman!” Sophia said looking angry.

“Oh Jenny dear how have you been doing” Arthur said followed by an “ugh” and a “whapaw”. Arthur had punched Lucius in the nose quite hard. The men rose from the ground.

“Well I guess I'll be seeing you at work” Lucius said, took an angry look at everyone at the store. “I'll see you at school Potter” Lucius's son Draco said to Harry Potter and followed his Father out of the store.

“Oh how stupid I've been, here's Harry Potter” Arthur said and garbbed Harrys arm and dragged him infront of him.

“Blimey, are you really?” Kevin asked amazed. Harry nodded. Then the parents moved aside to talk adult stuff.

“Hi Caramella” Said Fred and George.

“You excited to go to hogwarts?” Caramella answered

“Not really, I have ya'll to lean on if I'll fu... won't do everything as planned”

“You don't have to be worried Caramella, if someone picks on you we'll blow them up!” Fred and George said.

“What did I hear Fred?”.

“If someone picks on you Caramella we'll punch the devil out of them”

“I like that better boys thank you” Molly Weasley said.

“We'll take an arm or a leg” Fred and George whispered and winked to Caramella. Caramella allready felt a lot better.

“Why won't ya'll come over to our place for tea and refreshments!” Sophie asked, but Caramella knew it wasn't a question, it seemed either did anyone else.

“Sure, but I, Susanne and Sophie need to leave quite early, our train to Dublin leaves at 10” Kevin said.

“Why won't you stay at our place?” Bartholomew asked.

“Why won't we, sure” Kevin's wife Susanne answered gladly. They all returned to the parking lot.

“Bloody hell,, how are we all gonna fit in these two cars?” Ronald Weasley asked.

“Why I have a trick up my sleeve boy” Said Bartholomew smiling. Sophia opened the trunk. They saw that the trunk was much more than it meets the eye. There was beds and a couch, and even a tv.

“You always know how to surprise people” Sophia said with a happy face.

“So if Reginald's and Kevin's gang's go to the trunk and we'll go to the cars” Arthur said. It was obvious of course but someone had to say it.

“Why is Kevin's cild's name Sophie?” Austin asked his parents.

“We've been friends since our first year of Hogwarts and we are great friends, and I also saved his life thirteen years back. Him being a talented wizard and a great enemy of “who shall not be named”. He sent one of his goons, Lucius Malfoy to kill him and his family. I had been informed of this and I grabbed my broom and flew to Corc. Lucius had allready entered the house. I stunned him, we put him in a cardboard box and tied his hands and legs with duct tape and mailed him to Moscow. A year later Kevin encountered Lucius again and he, to be honest, kicked the hell out of him” Sophia answered looking quite proud of her acchievment.

“I'm also Sophies godmother”. They arrived to Bristol. Molly and Susanne decited to cook. The meal was delicious. Caramella thanked and went upstairs to feed her new cat. The other kids (other than Percy) joined Caramella upstairs. They could hear their parents talking about how interesting wax eporium working is. Caramella felt excited, she'd be leaving to Hogwarts in three weeks.


** Good story so far. Hope you don't mind if I make a few suggestions:

1):

#+begin_quote
  "Dad has been making breakfast" Caramella thought when she smelled the odor of freshly cooked bacon.
#+end_quote

should be this instead:

#+begin_quote
  "Dad has been making breakfast," Caramella thought when she smelled the odor of freshly cooked bacon.
#+end_quote

(The comma is important here.)

Or, if you want to get really technical, you could have it like this (because it's a thought):

#+begin_quote
  /Dad has been making breakfast,/ Caramella thought when she smelled the odor of freshly cooked bacon.
#+end_quote

2):

Another thing to note is using a comma when addressing people directly. For example, this:

#+begin_quote
  "We're going to Diagon Alley today kids!" mom said after Austin and Caramella didn't reply.
#+end_quote

should be:

#+begin_quote
  "We're going to Diagon Alley today, kids!" mom said after Austin and Caramella didn't reply.
#+end_quote

The comma before 'kids' is important, because the mother is talking to them directly. Another example (not from your story) would be the difference between:

Let's eat grandma.

and

Let's eat, grandma.

3):

If you're addressing the mother directly or are using 'mother' in place of a name, then it's preferable to capitalise it. For example, this:

#+begin_quote
  mom said after Austin and Caramella didn't reply.
#+end_quote

looks better like:

#+begin_quote
  Mom said after Austin and Caramella didn't reply.
#+end_quote

Another example (not from your story) would be telling one's dad. If 'dad' is used directly in place of a name, then it's better to capitalise it. I.e., "I'm telling Dad you said so!"

But if it's not in place of a name, then you shouldn't capitalise it. I.e., "I'm telling my dad you said so!"

4):

It's preferable to write out certain numbers in words (like JKR did in her books), as well as adding in hyphens where applicable. For example:

#+begin_quote
  She was an 11 year old child from Bristol.
#+end_quote

could be:

#+begin_quote
  She was an eleven-year-old child from Bristol.
#+end_quote
