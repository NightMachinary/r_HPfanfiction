Sirius survives/escapes from Azkaban because he's a dog animagus. I don't remember if this is canon or fanon, but something along the lines of dog slips from cell and makes it's way to shore.

All the other Animagi we encounter in the books (Peter, McGonagall, and Rita Skeeter) have smaller forms. Any of them could have had a much easier time of sneaking out, especially Rita. Unless they were known as Animagi (which is just McGonagall) it would have been easy. Sirius is known for something that was probably most difficult for him to do. It's really too bad we don't see the full capacity of what Animagi are capable of in the books.


** Sirius starved himself until he was thin enough to pass between the bars of his cell. He then got out the prison and swam toward the coast.

I think Sirius, and maybe Skeeter (since she could fly) were the only one who could have done it because while Peter or Mc Gonagall would have had an easier time getting out their cell, their form were probably not strong enough to swim all the way.

** Also, Sirius was able to transform because he knew that he was innocent, so the dementors couldn't drain his powers.

Although that raises the question of why someone with questiinable morals couldn't also escape, if they believed in their own innocence.

*** Being innocent would be a horrible thought to most, since it meant that they were wrongfully convicted.

For Sirius, while it was a horrible thought and a reminder that he was wrongfully convicted (and therefore not a happy thought), it was /also/ a reminder that he had never failed James and Lily, and therefore something he could draw strength from. When he found out Pettigrew was alive, it became an obsessive drive instead of just a resilient thought.

Someone with questionable morals would presumably have drawn pleasure from whatever horrible crime they committed, which would have been taken away. Being 'innocent' wouldn't help with that.

Someone who was legitimately mentally unwell who was pathologically unable to accept that they committed the crime might be able to draw the same kind of strength from their 'innocence' as Sirius, but they would likely not have the emotional fortitude to withstand the general drain of being near a Dementor like Sirius did.

** They'd have had an easier time sneaking out of their cells, but a harder time swimming across to the mainland. One assumes they would need to at least start the swim in their animal form, or the Dementors would notice.

Skeeter might have hitched a ride on someone Apparating back, but I doubt a rat or cat would have gone unnoticed.

** Usually it's illegal to be an unregistered animagus so I think for known animagi they would have additional spells or something to keep them in check. Rita would habe probably the best chance to escape
