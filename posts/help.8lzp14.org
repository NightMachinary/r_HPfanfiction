HELP! I read a one-shot a long while ago about Hermione and Harry on FFN. If I remember correctly, Harry leaves Hermione to be with Ginny and because Hermione loves him, she lets him go. She goes through some pain and eventually commits suicide. Right after Harry realizes he's made a huge mistake but it's already too late. I can't find it anywhere, i've been looking all night. i'm pretty sure that's how the story goes but it may be a bit wrong in some places. Please help!
