It wasn't love that allowed Harry to survive the Killing Curse. How many Parents would have died for their child or had. It wasn't love that defeated Voldemort. Lily Potter was a much smarter witch than that, but also a much more desperate one. Knowing she and James were going to die anyway if the Fidelius was broken, Lily anchored both hers and Jame's lifeforce to a Ritual, so that if they were murdered, then a pact with Yog-Sothoth was created. The Outer God was quite surprised, but when the pathetic creature missing a large portion of its soul tried to murder the child whose body that Yog now inhabited, the so called "Killing Curse" was reflected back at the creature. What better way to spite such a pathetic mortal than to hoist them by their own petards.

Harry basically ending up like Abby from FGO, and the "Power the Dark Lord knows not" is much more great and terrifying than any could imagine.


** This prompt reminds me of linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9172846/1/Deathly-Hallowed]]). Lily uses a ritual that defeats Voldemort, but that ritual, has unintended consequences.

  The Tale of Three Brothers was not a legend. It was a warning. No one cheats Death. And luckily for Lily Potter, the promise of the Cloak's return in exchange for her son's life was a fair deal. Stare into the abyss, Harry Potter, and we will see who blinks first.

**** Was there a particular aspect of the work that you wanted to see in the other fics?

The most directly similar one I can think of, thematically, would be The Eyes linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9767473/1/The-Eyes]]). But if there was a different aspect of the work you wanted to see more of, I can try to find you something along those lines :)

  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.

** I think I have seen a fic with this premise before, forgive me but I forgot what it was called.

Also, what does FGO stand for? It seems like something I might like to look into.

*** Not OP, but that would be Fate Grand Order - a mobile game based on a larger universe. Abby would be Abigail Williams.
