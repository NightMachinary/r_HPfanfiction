I was thinking about this earlier, thinking about Dumbledore's Put-Outer. When first introduced in essentially the prologue of Book 1 it seems to hint at another kind of magic system altogether that relies on charms and spells being bound up in objects, but then we never see anything else particularly like that throughout canon, and then it makes a random re-appearance in DH to be used by Ron as some kind of homing device despite there being no previous hint about that capacity.

As a community of people who know canon inside out and that contains writers who have created whole new worlds out of divergence points, I was thinking this might be an interesting thing to brainstorm and discuss. Obviously JK has revealed some in interviews (e.g. Hermione no longer having a sister, the Slytherin cousin), but I bet there are plenty more within the books that our users have noticed and privately noted over the years!


** For me it has always been Ron's narrative function. In the first book he operates as the native. He's at home in the magical world. He can recite strange factoids from memory, *HP:PS CH:14*

#+begin_quote
  ‘But it's against our laws,' said Ron. ‘Dragon-breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks' Convention of 1709, everyone knows that.
#+end_quote

and his hobbies and interests are given screen time and fold into the final challenge (chess scene). Additionally his actions drive a lot of the plot in regards to Malfoy and Hermione. He is also the vector through which we experience family life.

He works in the first book as an inverse to Harry, their lives being almost complete opposites.

His role is canablised by both Harry and Hermione as they turn native. For me this is best encapsulated here: *HP:DH CH:7*

#+begin_quote
  ‘I don't think there's anything hidden in the icing,' said Scrimgeour, ‘but a Snitch would be a very good hiding place for a small object. You know why, I'm sure?'

  Harry shrugged. Hermione, however, answered: Harry thought that answering questions correctly was such a deeply ingrained habit she could not suppress the urge. ‘Because Snitches have flesh memories,' she said.

  ‘What?' said Harry and Ron together; both considered Hermione's Quidditch knowledge negligible.
#+end_quote

That should have been Ron's moment. But by this point Ron's transformation is complete. Whatever he was in book 1 is gone to be replaced by some strange sockpuppet for JK Rowling, which I think is evidenced by this quote:

#+begin_quote
  I wrote the Hermione/Ron relationship as a form of wish fulfillment. That's how it was conceived, really. For reasons that have very little to do with literature and far more to do with me clinging to the plot as I first imagined it, Hermione ended up with Ron. I know, I'm sorry, I can hear the rage and fury it might cause some fans, but if I'm absolutely honest, distance has given me perspective on that. It was a choice I made for very personal reasons, not for reasons of credibility.

**** The problem with Hermione was half JKR, but the other half - and I think this is the true origin of Fanon Hermione - was Steve Kloves, the screenwriter for the movies. He was the one who lowkey shipped Harry/Hermione from the beginning, and took Ron's line from PoA ("If you want to get Harry, you'll have to kill me first") and gave them to Hermione. He also started making Ron goofy from PS (/falls through Devil's Snare/ "Lucky we didn't panic!" instead of "Are you a witch or not!?").

Rowling made Hermione flawed and insufferable, even though Hermione is never truly punished or called out for her darker deeds. But Kloves was the one who took out the flaws altogether.

Reading through fics that go big on canon rehashing, I notice whenever the authors use lines from the movies, that were never in the books. The carving "mudblood" on Hermione's arm scene in Malfoy Manor was never in the books.

***** I think I feel like compounded into this is the movies starting while the books were still unfinished, leading to JK compounding some character bits in her writing and picking up influences from her own adaptation.

E.g. I'm pretty sure Jason Isaacs originated Lucius Malfoy's long hair which then came to appear in later books. Were her later book characters influenced in other ways? Stands to reason that possibly.

****** It's not contradictory per se, but Fred and George were meant to be of Charlie's build who's described as stout and short (hence they are beaters). In Deathly Hallows they are taller than Harry who is of a height with his tall father. So Fred and George are now tall /and/ stout. I suspect that JK Rowling was probably influenced by the heights of the twins in the movies with that one, or the height of Harry.

******* The "mudblood scar" thing is not an inherently bad trope when I see it in fanfic, it's just a signifier than the author is bringing movie-canon or fanon into their fic. It's similar to Lucius Malfoy's long blond hair and snake walking stick. Lucius in the books was described to have Draco's blond hair and pale, pointy features, but the rest was made up for the movies.

Other movie-only lines are... more questionable when I see them in fanfiction, because it changes entire characterizations.

- "Years ago, I knew a boy, who made all the wrong choices", Dumbledore's line talking to Draco in the Astronomy Tower. Not in the books. "Draco, Draco, you are not a killer," is Dumbledore's most sympathetic line in the book version of the scene.

- "I make bad things happen to people who are mean to me," orphan Riddle from the Pensieve. Changed from the books, and changes the whole character. The book-canon line is "I make bad things happen to people who */annoy me./*"

This was one brilliant line, simply because even though the first guess, about that boy, would be Tom Riddle, it isn't certain. It could be Gellert Grindelwald who was also someone who met Dumbledore years ago, and made a lot of wrong choices. Or it could even mean Dumbledore himself, he despised himself for ignoring his own family in favour of glory, he could even be referring to himself in such a way due to self-hatred

***** To be fair, it was made clear from the beginning that Ginny's shy, retiring attitude was 100% because of Harry. Ron, Fred, and George all remark on it, and the one conversation Ginny has in the first three books that she doesn't know Harry can hear her for is her being pushy with her mom... to go and see Harry Potter.

It sucks that her character development was 'offscreen,' but when the 'camera' was the one making her nervous and quiet, that's pretty much the only way it could happen. The ultimate trigger for her rising back to relevance - Harry forgetting that Ginny was also possessed by Voldemort - is actually pretty well done, since Harry was cheapening Ginny's own hero complex regarding himself, so of course said hero complex would prompt her to lash out at the thing demeaning it... even if that was Harry himself.

**** Between the later books and the movies' portrayal of Ron, bashing his character is almost expected. It's hard to hate Harry, because we see the world through his eyes and he's a snarky bastard a lot of the time. His flaws can be easily overlooked because we see things from his perspective and understand his reasoning. Hermione's basically a Mary Sue, she's almost always right and gets a lot of positive moments throughout the series. She's too trusting in authority, until she isn't, and when she decides to break the rules it's generally overboard and she's never called out on going too far. Ron's the most flawed of the three, and makes some of the biggest mistakes (abandoning Harry in fourth year and on the Hunt, for example). His strengths are quickly forgotten towards the end of the series, and while he's loyal in the end, his laziness and mistakes stand out compared to Harry and Hermione's flaws. So it's not a leap in logic to think that they would be better off without him.

All three of them could have been written so much better. Harry's "power level" is inconsistent as fuck and there are times where he's either too passive or too active. He's able to do a post-NEWT charm most adults can't perform at 13, but when it comes to fighting Voldemort all he remembers is a spell he learned at 12. He learns spells past his year during the Tri-Wizard Tournament, teaches students a variety of advanced Defense magic, and is able to perform a couple of Unforgiveables during the later books, but he's mostly relying on luck during his actual fights. He also has so much motivation to do better and learn as much as he can in order to survive, but he doesn't really seem motivated beyond doing enough to get by.

Hermione should be called out for some of the shit she does, and either learn from it or just accept that she's a sociopath and embrace that. She does some downright nasty stuff and honestly I don't mind that. I like the theory that she is either a sociopath or psychopath and that's why she so rigidly follows the rules, but when she decides to break them she goes completely overboard, knocking out students, stealing fron professors, and making people sogn a cursed contract without telling them. My main problem is that it's just accepted as her being morally right, when either she should be condemned for it and learn to grow and be more empathetic, or she should embrace her ruthlessness and learn to control it better, using it against more dangerous people.

For Ron, his love of chess and Quiddich could have easily been transferred into a love of strategy as a whole. Make History of Magic a legitimate class instead of a borong joke class, have them go into detail on historical battles and politics and the strategies implemented during those events, and make it Ron's best class because he has an interest in the strategy of war. Keep him as the exposition on wizarding culture and law rather than just handing that role over to Hermione (unless, say, they're researching a law he's unfamiliar with and she finds it), and use his want to not be outshined by his brothers and Harry to motivate him more. He can start off by just doing the bare minimum in his classes, but give him a turning point where he realizes going on adventures with Harry and the war with Voldemort is serious shit and he needs to buckle up. Really the entire fourth year abandonment was pretty shitty, either make it work better and don't rehash it during the Hunt, or give him another way to have him and Harry get into a fight and make up later. Have both him and Harry learn and grow from it, and have that solidify their brotherly loyalty towards one another, so they always have each other's backs after that. I wouldn't have minded it so much if he didn't do the same thing later on in the series. I understand it was a stressful time and he was being influenced by the Horcrux, and that people can make the same mistake over and over again, but at the same time it seemed contrived (why the hell were they wearing the damn thing when Hermione has a bottomless bag and Harry had a bag that could only be opened by himself?) and it made him seemed so much weaker willed than Harry and Hermione, once again accentuating his flaws while minimizing their's.

TL;DR JKR is sometimes shite and could have done better.

***** Hermione is absolutely not a sociopath/psychopath-couldn't be further from it in fact, we see how much she empathises with others (Harry, Neville, Ginny, Xenophilius) and a sociopath/psychopath is fundamentally incapable of that level of empathy.

One of my biggest problems with fanon in fact is its tendency to potray Hermione as this cold and purely logical figure, when book Hermione is not. She's emotional and impulsive, and truly kindhearted and caring. Her controversial actions come out of passion and emotion-to her the worst sin (and by extension JK Rowling) is betrayel, and that's why she seemed so extreme in her measures against betrayel of Dumbledore's Army and Ron's emotional betrayels.

********** So there are 3 types of empathy

Cognitive empathy which lets you put yourself in someone elses shoes understand what they are thinking and feeling.

Emotional Empathy: Feeling what the other person is feeling. A kid sees another kid crying and starts crying.

Compassionate empathy: you are moved to help out of empathy. Someone feels sad so you give them a hug.

Id say Hermione is more sympathetic than empathetic. But to be very specific I think she might struggle with cognitive empathy at times even if she has the other 2 types.

Shes also very righteous and stubborn so it is also hieghtened due to this giving her maybe tunnel vision when she sets her sights on a goal.

I am not entirely sure if thats an autistic thing though so dont quote me on that

However I do know the whole sociopath and psycopath has been dropped as it was used as blanket terms for personality disorders and had negative connotations. But I dont think Hermione really has them. Though I do think if I had to pick she would show some symptoms of Obsessive Compulsive Personality disorder

People with OCPD have the following characteristics:

They find it hard to express their feelings.

They have difficulty forming and maintaining close relationships with others.

They're hardworking, but their obsession with perfection can make them inefficient.

They often feel righteous, indignant, and angry.

They often face social isolation.

They can experience anxiety that occurs with depression.

[[https://www.healthline.com/health/obsessive-compulsive-personality-disorder]]

Again this is more taken to an extreme I dont think anything Hermione has in common with this is extreme enough to consider her being ocpd in canon. But just a interesting tidbit.

The problem with Cursed Child's portrayal of Harry's parenting issues is how the writers unrealistically cranked up the drama over a ridiculous issue. Namely that Harry gave Albus a present that Albus didn't want, and that present was the baby blanket that Harry had been wrapped in when left on the doorstep by Dumbledore. Aunt Petunia had saved it for all these years (why???) and Dudley passed it on when she died. Meanwhile, James Sirius gets Harry's Invisibility Cloak.

And this ruins any enjoyment I could have had with the story. Because why on Earth would Petunia keep the blanket safe and in good condition for 40 years? The core of her character is embracing her normal muggle life, being as normal as possible, and dissociating herself from any connection to the abnormal and unnatural.

#+end_quote

Another example of poorly thought-out ideas was Alternate Universe Cedric. Exciting and unexpected as a plot element, but it's an inherent contradiction to the core of who Cedric is supposed to be. Thinking about this plot point makes it look like the writers didn't understand time travel, alternate universes, Cedric's character, or all of the above. This is a running issue with the plotting of the play - that things happened because the writers wanted it to happen, because they thought it was cool or interesting. Making sense was optional.

CC would be great if it only focuses on Albus' adventure at Hogwarts. The pressure of a celebrity's son and getting sorted into the 'wrong' house alone could be a great storyline. But the writers want to include as many aspect of the original works as possible. They use time travel so they can include Voldemort, Snape, Cedric, Umbrige, etc. >! It's similar with time travel in Endgame, it's only there so we can see Peggy, Howard, Frigg, etc. It's also there so we can re-live the Avengers' adventure in MCU.!<

Fantastic beast also suffers from this. The first movie is good, it explores a life of a magizoologist, the anti-muggle atmosphere within the 1920s, and introduces some charming character. It went wrong in the second movie; McGonagall already alive, Dumbledore teaching boggart in DADA, LeStrange and Avery as a villain, the 'Credence is Dumbledore'. FB want to explores the rise of Grindlewald but it still want to be known as a Harry Potter movie, so they put a lot of aspect of the original works even if it doesn't make sense.

This is never shown in canon.

The main proof I've seen used is the line /“You didn't just lose a mother that night in Godric's Hollow, you know. I lost a sister”/ from a deleted scene in the DH movie. It never appeared in the books, and Petunia never shows her love of Lily. Right up until the end, the Dursleys are petty and hateful to Harry and "his lot".

#+begin_quote
  Finally Uncle Vernon blurted out, "But what about my work? What about Dudley's school? I don't suppose those things matter to a bunch of layabout wizards---"

  "Well, I don't believe it," repeated Uncle Vernon, coming to a halt in front of Harry again. "I was awake half the night thinking it all over, and I believe it's a plot to get the house."

  "Ready, Diddy?" asked Aunt Petunia, fussily checking the clasp of her handbag so as to avoid looking at Harry altogether.

  "Why isn't he coming with us?"

  Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia froze where they stood, staring at Dudley as though he had just expressed a desire to become a ballerina.
#+end_quote

It's /Dudley/ who shows that he really does care about Harry, not Petunia or Vernon. Petunia and Vernon had no problem with leaving Harry on his own in their last appearance in DH.

Even if you could say that Petunia loved Lily when they were children, Petunia never loved /Harry/. She mistreated, abused, and neglected him for his entire childhood. She was ready to toss him out when the Dementors almost got her little Diddykins. If Petunia ever /could/ show love to the magical side of her family, the in-character version would be through keeping a childhood memento of Lily, like family photos or something Muggle that Lily owned. Not /Harry's/ baby blanket, which represented the day Harry and the wizarding world forcefully intruded themselves on her family.

*** I don't know if that's /too/ much of a strange factoid for Ron to know - I'm sure Charlie was always talking about dragons ;) (Honestly I doubt that 'everyone' in the Wizarding World knows /exactly/ when dragon breeding was outlawed and in what year/convention - they'd just know that it was outlawed)

In his case, I always felt he was the one to know/project how 'normal' wizards acted in their society - while all the more obscure factoids would fall more naturally to Hermione as exposition.

For instance, using an example from the modern US, Ron would be the one to know how the average American views the US Constitution - whereas Hermione would be the one to know the exact year it was ratified and the main writers of it.

It would have been nice to see some more disconnects between the 'book' wizarding society and the 'real' one - eg, Hermione reading a book on etiquette that's completely outdated or would be ridiculous in the current day, and Ron having to rectify that wrong knowledge.

The more obscure/theoretical the knowledge is, the less I think Ron should be the one to present it - after all, we see him from age 11 onwards, and he's not the most studious of characters (not a problem at all - but it does diminish his reliability from a reader's POV if he were to be the one to present the most obscure of facts that are supposedly /not/ known by most wizards). It also doesn't help that in his first scene on the train, he's fallen for a fairly obvious prank from his brothers on a spell (which would not really make sense for a wizarding child to fall for, IMO).

**** On your final point, I think it reasonable that Ron and most wizard raised children don't know any incantations pre-hogwarts , though they might have a vague approximation of what they are. That is to say, they understand that waving a wand and saying something produces a result. Neville certainly doesn't suggest a summoning charm when Trevor is loose on the train.

Silent casting is a mandatory skill, introduced before Apparition, so we can assume that basically every adult wizard in the UK is comfortable forgoing the use of incantations (Note that i mean using spells, not learning them). It has the added benefit of being a safety measure against curious children.

Based on this I conclude that there exists a cultural expectation that you don't incant around impressionable children, just like we wouldn't smoke or swear.

I think this is a somewhat questionable assumption to make. It's canon that not every student qualifies to take NEWT classes in every subject - McGonagall turns Neville away from NEWT Transfiguration for only achieving an "Acceptable" score on his OWL.

We're never explicitly told what the grade distribution for OWL scores looks like. If they're normally distributed (i.e. a bell curve), then most students probably score "Acceptable" in most classes, probably only scoring E's and O's in classes they're particularly interested in (or not at all). Being that the spellcasting classes are probably the most difficult in the curriculum, I'd be willing to bed that a lot of students probably fall short of meeting the prerequisites.

Are they ever depicted in any of Harry's actual classes in Book 6? It's canon that students can repeat classes, and even entire years - Marcus Flint is described as a 6th year in Book 1, and is still playing Quidditch for the Slytherin team in Book 3. Ergo, he must have repeated a year.

Ron and Neville were both members of the DA. I think it's perfectly reasonable to expect to see them both in NEWT Defense and Charms - they received the best practical Defense education of any Hogwarts student in decades, and learned the Patronus Charm for extra credit. The DA is the exception to the rule here.

** I can't think of any, myself (in fairness, it's been a /long/ time since I've reread canon), but I know a lot of people thought that Fortescue's disappearance was originally meant to be a setup for the seventh book, since PoA established him as being knowledgeable about history and the owner of an ice cream shop is a pretty weird guy to single out as a casualty of war.

Personally, I always that he was just bumped off to reinforce the stakes and make a point that /nobody/ was safe, but it's an interesting theory, and it's definitely possible that Rowling /did/ intend it as a setup, but dropped the payoff in DH when she realised that Ollivander rendered his intended role redundant. If, say, she originally intended for Fortescue to be forced to track the Elder Wand's path through history while Ollivander provided his expertise on wandlore, I can totally see an editor telling her to streamline that plotline by dropping Fortescue and having Voldemort track down the wand himself.

#+begin_quote
  Florean Fortescue, owner of an ice-cream parlour in Diagon Alley, is the subject of a ghost plot (a narrative that never made it into the final books). Harry meets him in Prisoner of Azkaban, where he finds out that Florean knows a lot about medieval wizards. Later, Harry discovers that an ex-headmaster of Hogwarts was called Dexter Fortescue.

  Florean is a descendant of Dexter, and I originally planned Florean to be the conduit for clues that I needed to give Harry during his quest for the Hallows, which is why I established an acquaintance fairly early on. At this stage, I imagined the historically-minded Florean might have a smattering of information on matters as diverse as the Elder Wand and the diadem of Ravenclaw, the information having been passed down in the Fortescue family from their august ancestor. As I worked my way nearer to the point where such information would become necessary, I caused Florean to be kidnapped, intending him to be found or rescued by Harry and his friends.

  The problem was that when I came to write the key parts of Deathly Hallows I decided that Phineas Nigellus Black was a much more satisfactory means of conveying clues. Florean's information on the diadem also felt redundant, as I could give the reader everything he or she needed by interviewing the Grey Lady. All in all, I seemed to have had him kidnapped and killed for no reason. He is not the first wizard whom Voldemort murdered because he knew too much (or too little), but he is the only one I feel guilty about, because it was all my fault.

** I would not be surprised to find out that very early on, the books were going to be a villain-of-the-week affair, and Voldemort was an accident.

There's only like four "real" locations (Dursley house, Weasley house, Diagon, Hogwarts) where the plot can be progressed, and the vast majority of it is Hogwarts. Hogwarts is the thing that changes with character action, so it's what you measure the plot against. That works fine for villain-of-the-week, but it's absolutely horrible for the /death cult and open warfare/ thing.

That's ultimately why the plot turns into a slog in books 6 and 7. Hogwarts is so central to the story that you can't actually bring the conflict there until the end of the book, because the conflict has gotten so great that it would leave Hogwarts unrecognizable, something you only want to do once per book.

In HBP, that problem is circumvented by Dumbledore being OP and preventing the conflict from reaching Hogwarts, at the cost of Harry sleeping through the first year of the war that stole his godfather (???). In DH, the conflict has reached Hogwarts, but they don't go there until the end, so the conflict that's supposed to be motivating the characters seems to come to a complete halt.

PoA is a look into what Harry Potter might have been intended to be. No Voldemort, no multi-book plot, and it's most people's favorite. CoS and GoF could easily be written to not include Voldemort. It's not until right at the end of GoF that this whole Voldemort plot becomes completely inseparable from the main plot, and OotP is what actually puts it in practice.

So I guess this comment is now pulling double-duty as "what's your unpopular opinion." Voldemort was a mistake.

*** This is a valid storyline, but if JKR really did plan the ending from the start, Voldemort would still have to be the villain of Book 7, and back in the flesh at that. Maybe no horcruxes and no Hallows, but he still did /something/ to come back from the dead, and they would have to figure out what and prevent it from happening again. The /war/ might have been a mistake, but Voldemort's influence should be felt behind the scenes.

For a minimal change from the canon series, I'd rewrite Books 2 and 4 with former followers of Voldemort making their own plays--or even blood purists/followers of Slytherin in general. Maybe have Book 5 be about Sirius versus Fudge by proxy. Harry and Dumbledore have been trying to get him exonerated for a year by that point, and it's finally coming to a head. But Voldemort should still come back at the end of Book 6. Book 7 starts with Voldemort vs. Dumbledore playing a game of spies and assassins in the shadows. Dumbledore dies halfway through, and Voldemort mounts an attack on Hogwarts as what he hopes to be the /opening/ salvo of the war, but is foiled by Harry's sacrifice.

***** Yes, it still tried to follow the rule, but since the series is leaning into YA territory with the political conflict and open warfare the last two books doesn't make sense. The series started to move away from the episodic format in the first four books in OOTP, but it failed horribly in HBP.

Even if we have the Astronomy tower scene, why didn't Voldemort do anything in the sixth year? It makes sense in book 5 because his return is still a secret, but there's no reason for the Death Eaters not to attack the Weasleys, burn privet drive to the ground, or even kill the Grangers, they are basically an open sport. I know he killed some people, but they're not someone close to Harry.

It makes sense for the villain of the year format if there's only one villain. However, we know that Voldemort is the main villain, he exist from the book 5, but barely do anything in HBP. You can't expect me to believe Voldemort waited for Harry to finish his exams.

**** My first thought is that the actual writing process went something like:

1. Basilisk plot (Hermoine petrified, Hagrid and his spiders, etc.)

2. Ginny being the culprit is the twist

3. Ginny's possessed by a generic cursed object

4. Turn the cursed object into a character

5. Cursed object is Voldemort

I suspect that steps 4-5 only became necessary later in the writing process. You can do steps 1-3 and come out with a complete story, but it's reliant on getting a timeline straightened out so coincidences line up, and setting up mechanics for possession that are believable and useful to the plot. That can get out of hand really fast, and at some point, may have gotten too tangled to be worked out in a reasonable amount of time.

Instead, JKR introduces the idea that the cursed item is, in effect, a character. Now, rather than coincidence and mechanics driving the plot, it's character motivation. It easily straightens out whatever convoluted mess she had written to justify all the events, but there's just one big problem: The plot wasn't actually designed for another character.

It's why the diary is unusually helpful about plot points it doesn't actually need to be helpful about. It's actually JKR writing the character into the plot.

It's also why the fact that the diary is "Voldemort" comes out of left field, and why Riddle is so different from real Voldemort. Going back all the way and writing Riddle in from the very beginning could have introduced as many problems as it was trying to solve. Instead, if you write him as an already-established villain, you don't actually need to establish the character in this book. He's already been established, you just don't know it until the end.

Of course, this is all just conjecture. I'm basically trying to reverse-engineer the story by isolating the story elements from smallest to largest, and figure out what could justify its existence based on the remaining parts. Writing is a pretty messy process though so it's hard to say what happened or how off-base I actually am.

If he could, it would be better foreshadowing because they are precisely the three in the group who can see thestrals. Then, everyone can sense that there's something ominous about the Veil, but they don't know what. Harry reacts as if there's great significance to Sirius falling through it even though he has no reason to consciously think that--and it's even more so written that way...But the reader doesn't have enough to go on to quite understand what happened.

Want to introduce the pain Harry of losing yet another important person in his life to the story? Do that. Having been able to experience some normalcy with Sirius for 2 years and getting that ripped away would make it even more heartbreaking.

I hadn't dwelled on it much till you mentioned it but yeah, this is a good one.

Even though Arthur and Dumbledore would later cast spells in the house with no consequence. By OOTP, Harry was charged when he used his wand to cast the Patronus. So what is it? Trace magic in a muggle house not using a wand, or magic out of the house using a wand? They are inconsistent with each other. If the ministry tracked any magic cast by an under 17 year old, Harrys warning in COS should never have happened.

Done.

Now the reader knows what it is, how it works, and how our heroes can circumvent it in their time of need.

You can even keep the "pureblood advantage" thing by saying that highly charged magical environments interfere with the charm, which is why underage magic doesnt get reported in Hogwarts, the train, Diagon, or old Pureblood Manors

House elf magic being able to replicate a different magical signature is also fine, but if you set that up in CoS, you should pay it off in some big way later in the series.

** I see the end of Book 5 as the final time JK took the idea of actual fights between two characters seriously and in response in books 6 and 7 severely nerfs, Voldemort and Harry into the ground. I maintain this because through the books we see Harry being built up as a powerful wizard over time

In book one we see him overcoming the odds and succeeding in tight places

In book two we see him uncovering plots and using his mind in New ways

In book three we see his determination and power not just in learning The Patronus but also in his dogged (hehe) attempts to save Buckbeak and Sirius

In Book 4 we see Harry become more skilled and capable we see him putting what he learned in the first 4 books to work and see him matching and over coming competition who are willing to cheat and have a advantage over him.

In Book 5 we see Harry becoming a Leader, we see him sacrifice his life and happiness to stand up for what is right and we see him being forged into hero we presumed to need.

Books 6 and 7 throw those books away, in Book 5 we see Harry and the others but primarily we see Harry stop and knock out several Death Eaters with little difficulty, including a few inner circle members. In fact we see Harry is only really out paced by Bella, Lucius and Voldemort. It establishes that Harry while yes a school kid and not ready for war is ALREADY a capable and skilled wizard who puts others to shame.

Then in books 6 and 7 almost every battle is a running fight, Harry never stands his ground and properly defeats someone, he is Almost always turned around running casting spells over his shoulder or diving to the ground blindly casting up at someone or chasing someone and casting at their back and still getting stuffed. In spite of him kicking several DEs asses the year before and Crucio-ing Bella with no response the year before only to be nearly beaten by Draco, Incapable of casting Silently and totally destroyed by Snape who by all accounts till then was not overly powerful and only had wanded abilities in Darker Aspects of magic... Oh and would of likely be out of Practice for upwards of a decade as he had been a Potions Professor for 15 years at that point and a year of defense teaching, and yet he rofl stomps Harry.

I see the first 5 Books as written with the intent that Harry would eventually defeat Voldemort in a Duel to the death Harry coming through the experience a hardened man where he once stepped into it as a scared child. Only for JK to get cold feet after the Voldemort/Dumbledore duel and turn to the self sacrifice ending

Unless you're suggesting that the author is a complete idiot (which is not really supported by the rest of the books) there is no conceivable way where she would have Harry fall for Ginny in the way that led to Voldemort's conception.

Frankly, if Rowling was more cynical, it might be a reasonable idea to think that all these mentions of love potions were to make sure that no one would imagine that the relationship between Harry and Ginny was started by a love potion, and yet this is exactly what is used an argument to support the inane love potion theory...

** Harry viewing the memories of the Lestrange trial (and later their escape from Azkaban) seemed to me like a setup for Neville to get an arc where he gets revenge-obsessed and then grows beyond it. We still get small bits and pieces of Neville's reaction to this and his growth, but it's not as interesting as it could have been.

*** Hermione was meant to have a younger sister but JK Rowling realised it was too late to introduce her.

Whilst the comment from Ron about his mother having a squib second cousin in Philosopher's Stone was meant to come to fruition with the introduction of Malfada who attends Hogwarts after her family discovered she was magical (and promptly dump her at the Burrow). She was meant to be a source of news and gossip and a Slytherin foil to Hermione, but JK Rowling realised that no matter how nosy it just wasn't believable for a child to have access to so much information so eventually moved her purpose onto Rita Skeeter.

** The moment in the Malfoy Manor when wormtail never was bound by harry's debt of saving his life but off handedly choked himself in the dungeons. It was like that scene was thrown in just for the sake of the debt being paid. There was no need for it.

Like when Voldemort was unable to kill harry it made sense if you dig it but Peter's sacrifice didn't felt like it. It felt like it was thrown in only because Jk doesn't had anywhere else to put it.

** Lol right. I get that, I do, and Teddy has loving people to take care of him, but what if something catastrophic happened and he ended up like Harry in a home with people that didn't love him? To your point, if that happened and tonks was still alive or even Remus, they could skip countries. Idk man lol

** Actually the Put-Outer with light and homing is logical because the ghost lights in a theatre represent all the positive emotion that have been expressed by the public.
