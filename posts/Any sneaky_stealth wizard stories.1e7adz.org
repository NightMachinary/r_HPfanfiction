I just had an idea of a thief wizard, it seemed cool, do any of you know of a good fix like that?


** Seems obvious, but there's the [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5199602/1/The-Thief-of-Hogwarts][Thief of Hogwarts]], which is incomplete but fun.

Also [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3695087/1/Larceny-Lechery-and-Luna-Lovegood][Larceny, Lechery and Luna Lovegood]] is a great fic about Harry and Hermione embracing the legacy of the Potter family's specialization in protective enchantments.
