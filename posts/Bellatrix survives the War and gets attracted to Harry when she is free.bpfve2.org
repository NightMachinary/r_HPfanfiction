while during her presence in Azkaban or after her penalty is finished, she gets attracted (or falls for) Harry. He stays like in Canon, so Married and Family, but with her as an Admirer.


** I've seen a couple of fics were she falls for him after voldemort's fall, but none with canon AND him being married and having a family...

*** well, i also know some fics that have her survive the War, but such fics are actually AU ones. But if you know fics, that have Harry being married and doesnt follow the Canon, you can still give me some, if you know.

**** The only one that I know comes a bit close is Deranged and Wrong: linkffn(7207849)

Harry isn't married and it doesn't quite match your request, but it's just about the closest thing to canon at the starting point that I know of in any Bellatrix/Harry ships that isn't heavy AU, time/dimension-travel or change Bellatrix entirely as a character ...If I recall correctly, been a while since I read it.

  When Bellatrix is saved from a life in Azkaban thanks to Sirius and his will, the Ministry decides to have her live with none other than Harry Potter. Time passes and feelings slowly change. Can this lead to more problems than Harry had ever imagined?
