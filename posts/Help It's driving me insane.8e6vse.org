So I have this one fanfiction.net that I've read before but I cannot find it again and was wondering if posting it here could help

Voldemort wins the first war. He makes so only purebloods can attend Hogwarts and everyone else has a different school (male and female separated) but Hogwarts education is shit compared to these new schools. Harry graduates this new school and joins his guard. They eventually sleep together. Also there is this part where they go to Hogwarts for a duelling competition and Draco loses then does something stupid and is given to the guards as a plaything.
