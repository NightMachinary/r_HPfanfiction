I want a fanfic where Harry uses Slytherin charms to make the Dursley's love him. I don't mind if it's slash or if it's Fem!Harry, all I want him to do is intentionally manipulate them. I don't want him to accidentally earn their love, it has to be deliberate. Bonus points if it works on his hogwarts professors too.


** "Oh, yes Aunt Petunia! I love doing the dishes! Just like a house-elf! Why, it's positively /magical/!"

And out of fear of having anything tangentially associated with the magical world in their lives, the Dursleys forbade Harry to do any housework again.
