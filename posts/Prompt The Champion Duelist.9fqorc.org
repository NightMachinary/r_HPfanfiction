In 1997, a young Muggleborn American wizard travels to Britain. He quickly becomes reknowned for his incredible spellcasting rate, flooding his opponents with spells, even defeating Professor Filius Flitwick, a retired duelling champion turned Hogwarts. Combined with his fame in the Muggle world, he quickly draws the attention of both the Dark Lord, and the Order of the Pheonix.

His name? Marshall Mathers.
