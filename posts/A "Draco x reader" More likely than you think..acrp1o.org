** Did you try the [[https://archiveofourown.org/works?utf8=%E2%9C%93&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=hits&include_work_search%5Bcharacter_ids%5D%5B%5D=966&include_work_search%5Bcharacter_ids%5D%5B%5D=1589&include_work_search%5Brelationship_ids%5D%5B%5D=1169993&work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bexcluded_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bcrossover%5D=F&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_from%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_to%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_from%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_to%5D=&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=1&commit=Sort+and+Filter&tag_id=Harry+Potter+-+J*d*+K*d*+Rowling][DracoxReader tag on AO3]]?

I looked through a few of the ones tagged with Severus Snape as well and found [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10227962/chapters/22695170][one a bit similar]] but not exactly

A lot of tumblr fics end up on AO3, but if they're one shots they'll usually end up in the author's fic that's loaded with one shots but that requires more leg work to search through

*** Yes, I have looked through ao3 and I've seen the fic that you've linked before but it is not that one, unfortunately. Thank you for helping though. I do believe the fic that I'm searching for was in the third person, that may help slightly as most "x reader" fics are in the first person. Again, thank you so much for trying to help.
