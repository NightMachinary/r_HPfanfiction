Maybe I'm a boring canon-slut, but that's how I roll.

Preferably not overly angsty or violent. And no BDSM

And if they come with in the form of a side-dish of another canon-friendly couple, that would also be nice, but preferably I want stories with those two pairings as the main focus.

/EDIT - Fixed the last sentence./


** My favorite canon compliant postwar fic [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]], linkffn(6331126), and everything else from the same author.

My favorite canon compliant Year 7 Hogwarts fic [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/][Not From Others]], linkffn(11419408), and everything else from the same author.

My favorite canon compliant H/G fic is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/][Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince]], linkffn(5677867).

My favorite AU H/G fic is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106).

Unfortunately, I have yet to find a canon compliant R/H fic I like, but [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/][The Dark Lord Never Died]] and [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]], linkffn(11773877), are by far my top AU R/H fics.

*** Thank you for the recommendations! In return, I'll recommend a fic to potentially find you a canon compliant R/H fic you might like:

My favorite canon compliant R/H fic of all time is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5316980/1/Sharing-Sleep][Sharing Sleep]], linkffn(5316980), it's a collection of moments throughout the series of Ron and Hermione falling asleep next to each other. It's really sweet and I think the author captured the personalities of the characters really well. Check it out if you haven't!

Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5231591/1/The-Hog-s-Head]]

#+begin_quote
  The Hog's Head By: MyGinevra The Hog's Head is an unabashed romance that follows the lives of Harry and Ginny from the Battle of Hogwarts through the following year. Chapter One, "Faith," begins during the Battle as Lord Voldemort calls his truce. It follows canon precisely but from Ginny's point of view. My own plot, post-DH, begins with Chapter Two, "Anticipation."

  Rated: Fiction M - English - Romance/Suspense - Harry P., Ginny W. - Chapters: 54 - Words: 399,051 - Reviews: 746 - Favs: 722 - Follows: 318 - Updated: Jan 17, 2010 - Published: Jul 19, 2009 - Status: Complete - id: 5231591

** "To Know You Is To Love You" is great. It takes JKR's offhand comment that Ron and Hermione would be fine with some couple's counseling, and then gives them that counseling in a really effective way: In order to fully understand each other, both of them is made to see the other's life the way the other has experienced it. Which means that the story tells the entire canon from the POV of Ron and Hermione, with additional commentary and reaction from the adult Ron and Hermione, who are following the whole thing.

  Calm, rational discussions have never been their strong point. When a pre-wedding fight shows them that they need to get it together, Hermione suggests couples counseling with an innovative new method. Ron reluctantly agrees, and now the two of them are going to learn about each other in a way never before possible.
