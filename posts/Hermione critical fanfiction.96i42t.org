I love Hermione she's one of my favorite characters. But she's not perfect and I haven't seen many fics that explore that or call out her flaws or even really hold her responsible for those flaws. Not in the same way I've seen people explore the flaws of other characters like Ron Harry Sirius Ginny Snape etc or hold them accountable. I don't mind if Hermione as a antagonist in the story but I do want the criticism to be actually valid. Not like hating on a chatacter for the sake of hating on her. I also dont mind if this is a story where she realizes she has flaws and grows from them she doesn't have to be stuck with said flaws forever ( but also don't make her get over them too quickly) . They just need to be shown and explored or pointed out.


** Actually, Hermione gets dissed quite a bit in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106):

She stared up at the professors with big, innocent eyes. I grinned. Not only was Ms. Granger clever, but she was apparently an adept liar and surprisingly loyal, considering our previous lack of a relationship. If she was as talented at dueling as she was the simpler magics, she would resemble a younger, saner Bellatrix. As we hurried to our dormitory -- dismissed by the professors -- I seized the chance to recruit a new minion.

"Hermione," I said sweetly, "Do you want to be friends?"

Merlin bless the simple interactions of children.

--------------

Hermione pouted. "So, that means we don't need to brew an illegal potion with stolen ingredients, knock out three of our classmates, tie them up in a closet, sneak into the Slytherin Common Room, and interrogate Malfoy?"

I gaped at her. "Was that your plan?"

I fear that Hermione may be the most evil of us all. That is concerning since I am a retired Dark Lord.

--------------

Upon closer observation, I had cast aside my early assumption that Hermione was this generation's Bellatrix. Her obsession with rules, goody-two-shoes personality, intelligence, and hidden cruelty were far more reminiscent of my younger self.

--------------

My jaw dropped in a very Weasley fashion. "You returned the time turner? But Hermione, we had the power to bend time to our will. We could have done so many things."

"That's why I returned it," Hermione said primly.

Traitorous, selfish, and unrepentantly evil...Yes, she was exactly like me at that age.

--------------

"Obviously," she huffed. "I'm just threatening to report that she's an illegal animagus. I also kept her in a bottle for a while."

I frowned. "For how long?"

"A couple of days," Hermione said.

"Did you feed her?" I asked.

Hermione paled. "It didn't really occur to me."

"You gave her water at least..." I said.

"Um..."

I shook my head, caught between admiration and shock. "And now you're blackmailing her? I don't know why you didn't just kill her quickly. It would have been kinder."

I have a great distaste for most forms of torture. My only exception to this is Crucio, which is much cleaner and does not have as many long-lasting side effects. Well, unless the victims are driven insane. I rarely kept prisoners long enough to reach that point, however, and opted to kill as often as possible. Further, I sought to never leave a child orphaned for more than a few minutes.

** That's actually a surprisingly tall order. The problem is that her /canon/ flaws (as opposed to her fanon flaws) are complex and are virtues half the time.

For example, if a character's flaw is that they are impulsive, that's easy to write, and it's easy to show the character suffering the consequences of that flaw and working to overcome it. However, Hermione's flaws tend to be more along the lines of her thinking that she knows what's best for everyone, and being willing to ruthlessly impose what she thinks is best on them whether they want it or not. To write the consequences of that sort of flaw, the author needs to set up relatively complex scenarios, with complex dialogue and characterisation.

This is further complicated by this flaw actually being a virtue---a part of what we call "leadership"---a lot of the time, because Hermione does accomplish a lot. Indeed, a whole lot of WBWL/Gray!Powerful!Independent!Harry fics actually treat this very flaw as a virtue when Harry does it.

Worse yet, her flaws are highly situational. In linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk), those traits that make her friendless in Gryffindor are the very traits that she needs to turn up to 11 to survive and even thrive in Slytherin.

Actually, now that I think about it, in ACA her friends /do/ call her out on her trying to run their lives for their own good, so that might be an example of the sort of fic you are looking for.

Another that comes to mind is linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3682339/1/The-Golden-Age]]), where Hermione's ruthlessness and protectiveness has consequences.

** You might be interested in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6254783/1/Rise-of-the-Wizards][Rise of the Wizards]].

It's a 'Harry makes his own side' style fic. In my opinion the author does a good job showing the perspectives of both Harry, Hermione and Ron, exploring their rather severe choices while not outright labeling either side as good or evil. In particular, it explores how Hermione might have developed some bad personality traits due to the habit of having Harry reliant upon her. She is dismissive of wizarding culture and politics while being absolutely assured of her own high intelligence, so she is susceptible to certain types of manipulation. Eventually she has to face the consequences

It's one of those fics that bashes a canon character for not knowing (and therefore taking advantage of) the author's fanon, sort of like Dumbledore gets bashed for not encouraging Harry to Swear on His Magic (So Mote it Be) during GoF or OOTP. And, it's all wrapped up in the classic bashfic package in which the author avatar righteously rants at the target, and the accepts the abuse meekly before either lashing out in impotent rage or running off in tears.

****** The issue I have with the story is that the author obviously intended to write the story as a criticism on Hermione's character in the series. It doesn't develop off flaws indicated in the books or criticises her actions in the series, the brunt of the criticism instead comes from made up fanon which makes the story pointless.

I love stories that take a different perspective, but this story might as well not be set in the Harry Potter universe for all it's validity. It doesn't offer any useful insight.

****** The outright fabrications and changes from canon from that fic:

- Elemental affinities
- An implicit obligation to abuse access to time-turners
- Arithmancy as a method for modifying spells accessible to a bright third year
- Hermione spending five hours preparing her hair
- Simple spells for hair preparation
- An obligation for Hermione to confess to starting the DA so she could be expelled along with Harry
- That it's reasonable to expect a teenager to immediately turn to lethal spells in dangerous situations
- Silent casting as a readily accessible discipline that an academically minded person would obviously want to pursue
- Hermione being jealous of Harry
- Hermione's grades slipping
- Harry beating Hermione in Charms and Herbology
- Hermione berating and forcing Harry not to go to Godric's Hollow (she just raised a reasonable objection about safety, and that objection turned out to be correct)
- Hermione spending time on the run studying 7th year material
- Hermione forcing Harry and Ron to do the same
- Hermione not trying to kill Nagini (there's no sign she shirked this duty; battles can be confusing)
- Hermione being able to make portkeys
- Hermione and friends being granted their NEWTs without sitting exams
- Hermione berating her friends for accepting that fabricated offer

The borderline stuff:

- Hermione modifying her parents' memory without their consent (movie canon, not book canon, apparently?)
- Bringing a person into a Fidelius-protected area not being enough to share the secret with them

The pure mistakes and implausible parts:

- A government organization specifically seeking out people who would break rules
- Sleekeazy's being sold when there is a simple spell that replaces it
- An academic organization preferring candidates who had not taken standard academic exams
- A government interview going through what you'd done as a teenager

And then there are maybe four reasonable points.

That's garbage.

If successful, the ministry could increase availability of ministry clerks during peak times without hiring more people to sit around during less busy times, Aurors could use intelligence that they might have received a little too late for it to be useful, etc.

Seeing how it affected Hermione, the idea was probably sent back to the drawing board, and postponed indefinitely after the destruction of the time turners in June 1996.

  Seriously, a time turner is a ridiculously powerful artifact and being given one for extra classes just makes no sense!

Actually, it makes perfect sense in a world of bumbling wizards with funny names and pointy hats, who obsess over a silly game like quiddich.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start][Returning to the Start]], linkffn(10687059), is very good H/Hr fic, but this Hermione got stuck in her 'good guys don't kill' mindset for a long time.

Hermione can be stubborn to a fault in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10099028/1/Murder-Most-Horrid][Murder Most Horrid]], linkffn(10099028).

Despite appearing more powerful and even more knowledgeable than in canon, the Hermione in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(9863146), actually got lots of important things wrong. Harry had much better intuition and leadership skills.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.
