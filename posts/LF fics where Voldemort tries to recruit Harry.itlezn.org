Hello! I'm looking for fic recommendations that are not AU (no drastically different beginnings like wrong boy who lived, or grew up with a dark family, etc), and are platonic (at least no Harry/Voldemort), where Voldemort tries to recruit Harry.

I recently rediscovered HP and the Slytherin Connection by KrystalRoze and realized that this isn't a dynamic I've often seen, especially where he is still the villain of the story but Harry isn't completely taken in by him. I then read HP and the Problem of Potions by Wyste, which had a very well written Voldemort who I really enjoyed.

Thanks for any suggestions!
