It's a pretty random request but is there any long 60k+ fanfics where Harry is raised in America but then returns to go to Hogwarts?

It would also be nice if his parents were alive and maybe had a sibling?


** In the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/822597][Obscure Guardian]] series, Sirius escapes Azkaban when Harry is four or something and takes him to America where they stay until the Triwizard Tournament.

** Might be a bit off topic but in a lot of the ones I read usually a character who is from the US is called a colonial for some reason and it makes me cringe just had to vent this for some reason.

*** I think that is a way to show that the wizarding world is still in the 1700's culturally speaking. That would be the time period where America was still â€˜the colonies'.
