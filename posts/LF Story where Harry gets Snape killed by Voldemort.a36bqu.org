I am looking for a story that I think is mostly sixth year, at one point Harry makes comments where Draco can hear about Snape being a spy for Dumbledore in order to get him killed. If any one could point me in the right direction I would appreciate it.

  Nine years ago Vernon Dursley brought home a certain puzzle box. His nephew managed to open it, changing his destiny. Now, in the midst of Voldemort's second rise, Harry Potter has decided to recreate the Lament Configuration... and open it... again.
