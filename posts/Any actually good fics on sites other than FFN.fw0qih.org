I mostly use FFN (and sometimes AO3), since I can use the official app to read offline easily on my phone. Recently, however, I came across an easy solution. Download the fic and use an ebook reader.

And so, I am now in search of all those fics that I passed up before this. Any help would be appreciated. My only requirement is that it not be slash or multi/harem. I'd prefer if it wasn't abandoned, but if it's good enough, I'll read it anyway. Oh, and no PWP!

Thanks in advance!


** It depends on what are your preferences. There are sites like [[http://www.siye.co.uk][SIYE]] or [[https://www.phoenixsong.net/][Phoenix Song]], which are oriented on Hinny or all canonical pairs, respectively. There are obviously other sites which are focused on other ships, but I am less familiar with them (for example, I cannot find Hawthrone & Vine, which was a famous Dramione website). There is always [[https://www.wattpad.com/][Wattpad]], the paradise of all teenage writers.

I thought I was too harsh about Wattpad, but then I just took a look at the site and this is the blurb of the first (paid for?) story promoted there:

#+begin_quote
  When Ryan is assigned a male dorm by accident, she has no choice but to put up with infuriating(ly hot) college bad boys. But what will she do when things get out of control?
#+end_quote

Should I say more?

*** I might just go about searching for pairing oriented sites later. Thanks for recommending them :).

I only post there because some people actually said they read fics on it, but after reading some of the content there, I felt a lot better about my subpar writing.

**** That's a tough one as i would normally just hit the search engine and then download the story (epub) that struck my fancy. In some cases the author had stories there they had other places.

For instance you can find a lot of canoncansodoff stories there which i like.

For convenience sake i finally used the option they gave an downloaded the entire archive (regrettably their search engine didn't come along).

** From the FanFicFare wiki, [[https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare/wiki/Supportedsites][here is a list of supported sites]]. And if you're unfamiliar with it, FanFicFare is a plugin for Calibre (an ebook management system) that will download fics for you, as well as update in-progress ones with the click of a button.

As a bonus, if you use the Kindle app Calibre can be configured to email stories to your personal documents, putting them in the cloud for you. Which means that your ereader at home and your phone at work will always be on the same page via whispersync :D

*** Would you say the Kindle app is better than Aldiko? I was planning on using Aldiko, since that's the only one I've seen which wasn't too hard on my eyes, but I'm fine with using something else.

**** I have a Paperwhite 2, so kindle is the obvious choice for me because of whispersync, but there's absolutely nothing wrong with Aldiko: I've used it myself and liked it. It's also a bit more user friendly as far as your library goes iirc.

If you don't have an actual Kindle e-reader, then the only benefit to using the amazon app is the [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200767340][document cloud]] and sending the books to your phone wirelessly via Calibre. However - this gets messy with In-Progress stories as the original one in the cloud is just treated like a duplicate.

If your eyes are bothering you with most apps and you're an avid reader, I'd really suggest getting an e-ink device. It's a night and day difference between a kindle (or similar) and a tablet for reading, and you can bet that in the seven years since I've bought mine I've gotten my money's worth and then some out of it.

***** I might actually invest in a Kindle, sometime in the future. You can import downloaded PDF/EPUBs's, right?

****** Yeah you can, though I avoid PDFs like the plague as - at least with my admittedly very old kindle - they're a nightmare to read. No zooming, just one whole page at a time :(

Kindles take the .mobi format rather than epub, so you'd need to convert them if all you have is epub. Again - Calibre is great, will do that for you with a couple clicks and will prompt you for it when you try to move a book to an amazon device. If you must have epub support, pick up a Barnes and Noble e-reader (a Nook) instead.

And as a reminder? They can be used to read library books too!

** I don't really remember well where I read the things I'm afraid but I can recommend browsing through [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/CategoryStories-1-5/Harry+Potter.htm][Twisting the Hellmouth's Harry Potter section]] for crossovers (mostly for the site's mian fandom of Buffy The Vampire Slayer), [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/browse.php?type=categories][HP Fanfic Archive]] which has a handful of stories not on FFN, and [[https://ficwad.com/category/19][ficwad]] mostly for stories that are far shorter but a lot of them are only there, I'd recommend signing up for the last one so you can filter out stories ranked below 3 or so.

****** Hey my first tries in writing stories was a creative writing class on a harry potter minecraft server so I really can't blame anyone for their first tries, I did get E's and O's on them though...

Also I have a carp ton of fic ideas but I believe I don't have enough to change the plot enough to make it writable to me, I love my creativity and if I have to work off of a predetermined plot then I'll probably die of creativity starvation
