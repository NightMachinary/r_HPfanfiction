** Slytherin House during Voldemort's time was absolutely dominated by blood purists, but that was likely the result of the Sorting Hat dumping every blood purist there, even though their personality was not suited at all. For example Crabbe and Goyle had none of the ambition, cunning, and resourcefulness a true Slytherin needs. From the Books, it seems that Pansy Parkinson and Millicent Bulstrode also barely qualify.

**** Well cruelty and disregard for human life doesn't really equal cunningness and ambition. I think that it makes sense the stereotypes were perpetuated by the hat just putting the blood purists in slytherin because the students are allowed to ask what house they want to go to and im assuming that many of the blood purist families are like the Malfoys, they see all houses other than slytherin as inferior, so the kids of those families would ask to be sorted into slytherin.

Disregard for human life in pursuit of own advancement is just an extreme of Slytherin-style ambition. (Disregard for human life in pursuit of the greater good is the analogous moral failing for a Gryffindor.)

Cruelty is exercise of power to cause unnecessary suffering. Someone personally ambitious---who seeks power over others---may well be gratified by such an exercise of power.

I can't psychoanalyse Crabbe and Goyle nearly as well, but consider that for all their lack of intelligence, they knew exactly to whom to attach themselves to make the best of their situation, and also when to stab him in the back when he faltered.

I still believe the blood purist sorting situation makes sense though.

** I mean they are surely not all bullies and blood purists. Being ambitious and cunning isn't evil. But it also depends on which school years we are talking about. I'd expect more blood purists running around during the rise of Voldemort than in peacetime. And according to canon, it was /Slytherin/ that was mainly harbouring future Death Eaters. (Or already made Death Eaters. Regulus Black was marked when he was 16). I'd also expect Malfoy and his croonies to act like bullies because they are. But I'd rather not see all being evil.

** The only reason I dislike it is because it has a similar logic to the very prejudice we like to hate Slytherins for. Why should every eleven-year-old kid who sorts to Slytherin be presumed to be evil? Doesn't that follow the same type of black and white thinking that we condemn bigots for? I would prefer to see them portrayed as a realistic group of people. That means that they are diverse. Any time we infer a list of standard traits from one feature, we're treading a dangerous line. Slytherins should be no more homogenous than Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, or Ravenclaw. After all, those houses gave us the juxtapositions of Peter and Hermione, Cedric and Zacharias, and Luna and Gilderoy Lockhart. Of course, writers should write what they want, but I worry when we let ourselves fall into patterns of stereotypical thinking.

I'll step down from my soapbox now.

Anti-Slytherin prejudice is literally about the content of their character.

As for why an 11-year-old kid would be presumed to be evil? Well, "evil" is a strong word, but we at least know that the kid is more prone to deceitfulness (a.k.a. "cunning") and selfishness (a.k.a. "ambition") than average. (Of course, then, their house will bring out the worst in them, and they /will/ end up evil with a few exceptions.)

*** Yes. Of which Peter, for instance, should have been in Slytherin, because he showed no Gryffindor traits. Which is to say, instead of using those characters as examples of diversity, I'd flip the argument around, start from a point of homogeneity, and declare them miss-sorted Slytherins.

The fundamental issue is that the Houses *do fall* along lines which people would describe as "good" and "evil". Or in less sensational terms, it is a divide over what is morally desirable, e.g. selfishness vs. altruism. You can't get around the issue that Slytherins are, for instance, selfish or cheats /because those very traits are considered good within their House per its definition/.

In other words, the diversity that certainly exists in the population is split and grouped using a clever combination of nature and nurture (people in Slytherin may be predisposed to such character traits, and then grow up being encouraged to develop them), such that within the House, little diversity is left.

If this is not what you want (and I can agree it might get tiring at some point), you fundamentally need to remodel how Houses work. But then, that is what FF is for :)

Are they actually though?

I've looked a couple lists of Slytherin traits, and none of them included those.

Pottermore says these are the Slytherin traits:

  Ambition

  Resourcefulness

  Pride

  Determination

***** Well, I'm not sure which lists you mean, so I can't comment on them.

Part of this, at any rate, is a problem of show vs. tell. The prototypical Slytherins are Pansy and Draco, and Pansy's scene demanding to hand over Harry in DH is the most Slytherin moment in the series: She is attempting to save her own hide by selling out Harry.

But consider also how the Slytherin Quidditch Team plays, or Voldemort's world view of reducing everything to power or the lack of it. Pottermore appears to be a bit fluffed up, possibly to make it appear a bit more welcoming, and so is the Hat's take. But even so, it's all there: Cunning turns into knowing how to take advantage of people and situations, Ambition turns into desire for power, Resourcefulness turns into lacking any sort of limits in pursuing the goal, ...

You can run down the list, and all of those are nicer phrasings of what we see, just like the Hat's "Slytherins use any means to achieve their ends" is a nicer way of putting my "cheats".

This isn't really bashing, it's simply a description of what we see. And IMO, that is okay. I'm fine with a house full of people ranging from "screw you, I got mine" to Voldemort MK.II. As I said, it's interesting.

You have to invert your perspective: Slytherin isn't just another representative sample of the population from which follows diversity, none of the Houses are. Rather, you start with the assumption of homogeneity, so it's like if you collected all bullies from you local school and put them into one room together. The result would be fascinating, I'm sure.

I think it's very realistic. I've posted this half a dozen times, but it isn't any less true for it:

1. Take children who are already predisposed to value or at least tolerate dishonesty and ruthlessness (euphemistically called "cunning") and self-aggrandisement (i.e., "ambition") over other things.
2. Teach them that these traits are virtues and that everyone else is against them.
3. Also teach them to admire a founder who was considered to be racist /in his own time/, which was /a thousand years ago/.
4. Appoint heads of house who alternate between corrupt wheelers-and-dealers (Slughorn) and former Death Eaters who never outgrew their childhood rivalries (Snape).
5. Let them stew in this environment for 7 years.

**** The Hogwart's Houses, while a ‘fictional book's house system', are also based on Hippocrates' four temperaments theory: Sanguine - Adventurous, carefree, high risk tolerance (Gryffindor). Phlegmatic - Loyal seekers of close interpersonal relationships, empaths, mediators (Hufflepuff). Choleric - Independent, career oriented, decisive, ambitious (Slytherin). Melancholic- analytical, deep thinkers, intelligent, often introverted (Ravenclaw).

Montessori teachers often use this system to better understand their students' individual needs - an example would be some children love to share their toys, others would rather keep their special items to themselves - neither of these behaviours are ‘wrong' and it certainly doesn't mean the child who refuses to share is “bad”.

It works well for children but as we get older our personalities develop and we are influenced by our experiences and environments so of course it isn't a perfect system but there's lots of recent theories out there about the different types of personalities and you'll find most have a basis in this original theory. The Myers-Briggs personality theory is a good example that most people have heard of - I think there are 16 personalities represented in that theory.

What I find really interesting is how this often correlates with Harry Potter Stans and their /chosen/ Hogwart's houses (anyone relying on a quiz to tell them which house they belong in isn't a real fan) - I see a lot of millennials who were previously one house now identify as a mixture, things like ‘Ravenclaw' and ‘Gryffinpuff'.

I have four children and it just so happens each one correlates with a different temperament. As a Montessori teacher myself it fascinates me how they can all be so different and it's really interesting for me to watch them go through life dealing with things in completely different ways.

My point was Slytherin's shouldn't be portrayed as inherently evil villains. They aren't. The films did a disservice to the books by making the four houses represent Courage, Intelligence, Evilness and... I don't know, Stupidity? It was lazy.
