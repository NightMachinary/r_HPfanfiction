I'm in a weird mood and I'm looking for any well done fics where Lucius Malfoy is a good person in general. (For example, I was reading one a while back where Lucius hears about the abuse Harry endures at the Dursleys and steps in to do something about it when he learns that Dumbledore has no plans to fix the problem. That kind of thing.)

I'm not too particular about ratings, bashing, or any of that other stuff, I just want something good to read üòä


** He is a good dad in canon. No child would threaten others with their father if the father was abusive. But yeah, linkao3(17962433) is a good Lucius x Narcissa fic.

  Narcissa Black has finally left Hogwarts after 7 years of schooling. Now she has her future with Lucius Malfoy to look forwards to. She hopes it will be easy but fate has a funny way of working and the couple will face many twists and turns before they can find their happy ending. This will be slightly darker than my other fics in that Voldemort survives the First Wizarding War

**** Thanks for the rec, I'll check it out as soon as I'm home for the day! Yay!

I would never accuse Lucius of being a bad father in canon, but I mention it only because I wanted to include that as a potential focus of a fic. Some fics show him as being super detached parent, and others show him being a real dick as a father, but I enjoy it when he's shown more as the parent he is. :)

** If you don't mind Drarry, and some pretty out there ships, linkao3(12006417) is pretty good. Lucius isn't really a good person, but he is a good dad in this one

  In the middle of their second year, Draco and Harry discover they're soulmates and do their best to keep it a secret from everyone. Their best isn't perfect. ~‚ÄúAre you trying to get killed, Potter?‚Äù Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. ‚ÄúThis is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.‚Äù Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, ‚ÄúPotter, what the hell--‚Äù~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)
