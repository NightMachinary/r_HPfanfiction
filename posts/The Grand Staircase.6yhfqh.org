"We have magic, but no elevators? No escalators? And there isn't a transporter room hidden somewhere nearby?"

*** Alternative Counterpoint:

We know that most of the furniture/architecture of Hogwarts is kinda dickish. [[https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/123458/how-do-the-hogwarts-staircases-move-in-the-books][Stairs that try and trap you, walls that pretend to be doors, etc]]. Maybe the reason the entire magical world is so technology-resistant is that the more complex the device, the more dangerous it is to humans when infused with magic?

*** They do have escalators. See: the stairs to the Headmaster's office.

At any rate, I'm not sure about you, but where I went to school the students were expected to use the stairs; we didn't have the luxury of elevators or escalators (unless you were moving cargo [which, with magic, is a non-issue -- see: featherweight, shrinking, levitation charms, and space-expanded rooms/bags] or were disabled [again, with magical medicine, shouldn't really be an issue -- if you're disabled enough to not use stairs, you should be in the hospital]).

******* To me a Hammer Map would be a lot easier, though I've never made anything nearing that large before. (Also with Hammer, if you make a mistake with the geometry then you can just readjust it, but with minecraft you have to rebuild it)
