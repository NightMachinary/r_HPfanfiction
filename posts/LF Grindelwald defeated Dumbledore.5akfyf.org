** Are you specifically looking for Grindelwald defeated Dumbledore or are you more generally interested in a dystopian world where the bad guys won long ago? If the latter, I would highly recommend linkffn(reign of the serpent).

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.
