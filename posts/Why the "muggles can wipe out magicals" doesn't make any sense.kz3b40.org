Now, I've seen many fanfics which use this trope,like 'the prime minister looked coldly at fudge,and said in a menacing tone"we have guns and nukes!"I mean why? sure,magicals are numerically inferior but that doesn't mean you can wipe them out.magicals have wands and they(nearly everyone) can cast an spell of mass destruction ,if taught correctly...it was shown in books that even a guy like Crabbe was able to use fiendfyre(use, not control).now fiendfyre can be compared to a nuke in its effectiveness,without the hassle of making and preparing a huge missile.so.....


** Honestly it all depends on how competent we believe the magicals to be. Canon adults are useless because its written for kids and you can't just have the adults solving the problems or there isnt any plot. I believe canon magicals would lose against muggles simply because of that.

Realistically though, magicals would absolutely walk over any muggle opposition, even if you don't go to extreme solutions like aparation and fiendfyre every city and or military camp. Simply going around imperio-ing/obliviating/confounding officials or vanishing away their weapons, planes, tanks, missiles etc., not to mention that as far as we know, muggles simply can't find the wizards. A single dedicated wizard could wreck a muggle country in a few days our less.

*** The problem is that if we are really realistic, then the Muggle PM would already have a rapid action group and ample intel. One thing that surprised about the books was the Minster of Magic introducing himself to the PM. And this one does... nothing. Highly unrealistic. The existence of magic implies that any hostile nation with magical operatives would constitute an existential threat. Apparate in 10 Downing Street? Check Imperio, interrogate, kidnap and/or supplant the Prime Minister/scientists/generals/ Head of MI-6? Check. Break into nuclear facilities? check. Thus they would have recruited wizards, probably starting with discriminated against Muggle born ones (which in fiction just wait to be enslaved/slaughtered by Dark Lords, passively, rather than asking for help form their Muggle government.). Once you have a few MI-5 hit wizards/witches, you have tracked & studied Diagon Alley, Hogwarts, Hogsmeade, most pure blood residences, essentially every key Magical location in Britain. You've tested their spells and prepare counter measures. And you have warded key facilities. And if the counter measures are realistically not enough, you strike first. Classic Cold War balance of powers doctrine.

But I guess the whole world JKR built probably cannot manage this kind of realism anyway and just breaks apart.

**** On the other hand wards seem to be little more than an annoyance for Voldemort, to say nothing of the teams of curse/ward-breakers specialized in making them a non-issue with professional training and resources that muggleborns just plainly can't get their hands on if we go with the levels of discrimination you described.

If Voldemort can track muggleborns in the magical world chances are that he also can do so in the muggle one, with potentially even worse results if they were to say his name (unaware of the taboo) while asking for help from the muggle government, would love to read a story where a muggleborn goes to the prime minister at the beginning of the war to ask him to interfere, says Voldemort's name and a bunch of DE show up, see many muggles and decide to save time by casting Fiendfyre on the whole building.

Any measure or countermeasure would boil down to how prepared any side would be for the capacities of the other, but in this case I would give the advantage to the magical side, if for no other reason than because of how versatile magic is and the problems of trying to counter for every single application of it based only on the knowledge of the few muggleborns they could get (which, again, if discriminated against as much as you implied wouldn't have access to knowledge about obscure or advanced applications of magic, to say nothing that we can't expect everyone of them to have devoted their entire Hogwarts years to study as so many like to act as if Hermione did -she invested a fair bit of time on other things such as SPEW and helping to save the world, and this is assuming that magic /can/ be countered without direct application of magic or that there is no monitoring over the muggle government (Shacklebolt managed to become part of the PM's security team without anyone even suspecting him, with the kind of background check such a position would have called for they must either be able to use magic to make it so it is impossible for muggles to suspect them even without his presence -the people checking wouldn't be in front of him- or they have surveillance and influence over the muggle government great enough to to provide false information and make it believable enough that it doesn't raise suspicions, not sure which would be the worse option for muggle government but either would negate or at least severally impair their ability to strike first with the worse case scenario being that they would end provoking the WW into striking first to prevent another attempt)

Mandrakes are essentially sound bombs that kill whoever hears them and they are common enough to be used at /schools/ instead of religiously guarded and cultivated by professionals herbologists, /at the very least/ this puts their numbers above the number of dragons, plus they are reusable -strap one into something, enchant it to float into a route through a city and with only a bit of planning up to tens of millions are killed with only one that can then be recovered to be used to kill some more tens of millions, in the same day even, depending on the speed. Dementors can only be seen by magicals and are only affected by the patronus charm, same with Lethingolds, and more importantly, they /reproduce/ it would only take stop containing them to have dementors become an unkilable mass murderingly apocalyptic invisible pest, not taking /any/ active measure, just ignoring them. Then there is Fiendfyre which is a spell that at the very least is easy enough that not only many DE know, but that even /Crabble/ managed to conjure (although not control) to very destructive results, just the fact that it seeks it's fuel and can't be stopped without magic already makes it terrifying for muggles, even more so since it was implied in Crimes of Grindelwald that the larger it gets the harder it is to dispel even with magic.

I personally have a bit of a head cannon that the Prime Minister position is cursed in roughly the same way as the DADA post, but in such a way that no matter how bigoted or paranoid the sitting minister, they will be unable of even consider revealing the secret even /after/ the leave the post, will not even contemplate making preparations to fight the magical world and will at least be a bit more compliant to the magical side of things. Admittedly, this is based more on the behavior of the PM on that scene Scrimgour goes say hello and in presuming that it happens every time a new PM or MoM is elected, other than that can't really think of a believable way the Statute could survive the first dangerous idiot taking the position.

*** to be fair, there are few shield spells that I can see dealing with bullets. Magic is shown as very slow, like very very slow... A wizard has to cast a shield charm to protect themselves, but tell me how fast can he be against a bullet? Who normally hits you before you even hear the sound of the bang? Or a sniper rifle so far away you don't know until you are dead...

And sure we can say that wizards surely have some spells against that, but that is as much redcon to make the wizards unbeatable. Not the other way round

**** There are clothing items that were charmed to shield against a large variety of light-moderate curses, hexes, jinxes, and other unfriendly spells magic. Those were created by W.W.W. (fred and george's joke shop). I'm certain there's a charm that could be put on clothing that would halt projectiles and if not it could be created within a couple weeks if not days as protecting against a singular action would no doubt be easier than covering a wide range of effects.

​

But even if such clothing were to exist, there are plenty of mundane weapons that could easily still take down wizards. I'm just tired of the simple 'gun beats all magic' logic used in fanfiction and would rather the authors be more creative.

I'm just saying that magic is a lot more versatile than muggle weapons and can do things muggle can't, but muggle weapons are not without their advantages as well and one I see is speed. Bullets fly faster than sound and spells seem to be slower than sound. Wizards can react to their opponents spells, you don't really have time to react to a bullet.

** Wands are cool and all, plus you're right that pretty powerful & destructive magic can be wielded by just about anyone.

The one thing they don't have going for them, at least it isn't shown often in canon, is range. Guns, let alone missiles & bombs, can be deadly from 100s of metres away, and are harder to trace back to their point of origin unlike most spells and the spell-light trail they leave behind. Also, take away a magicals wand and they'd be pretty useless, whereas most muggles would be fairly competent in melee fighting.

1-on-1, in small skirmishes or close quarters, I'd back a wizard but overall, in a larger scale all out war type of situation, it's bye-bye magicals in my opinion.

****** Only 'evidence' I recall for magic/tech causing issues for one another is the Weasley car going rogue /after/ being enchanted up the wazoo, driven through the air while invisible for a decent chunk of it across a decent chunk of the country (something like 450-550 miles, maybe more) to crash into an enchanted tree at an enchanted castle and the comments in GoF about bugs not working /at Hogwarts/.

Bear in mind, you're talking electronic bugs, which are small and delicate with some sort of receiver for sound/visual and some thing to either transmit what they detect or record it, not something built more durable.

There's no evidence I've seen (unless it's in the newer stuff for Scamander or Cursed Child) that there's any issues with them having an active 'gate' at King's Cross for platform 9 3/4, nor issues from the Ministry being under some buildings in London, or Diagon Alley also in London, nor do we see anything that I recall about Grimmauld Place's residents having issues due to #12.

The only other thing I can think of is the dementor encounter in OotP causing things to go 'dark', but how much of that was Harry's reaction to them and how much was their effects on the environment I don't think we learn.

On the flip side, at least some tech can work with magic, since the car does still run despite the enchantments, the Hogwarts Express works, the Ministry has their own car fleet (I think) and the 'wireless' is a big thing so at least up to vacuum tube level tech works to some degree.

******* With respect to your point on Bugs. Bugs won't work because of their circuitry and electricity. Those are the key points of weakness. Not their size or build.

Hogwarts Express is a steam engine. Not electric. It's mechanical.

With the Cars, again cars are mostly mechanical with bits of electricity - mainly battery and spark plug for the engine. Weasley's car, no idea if he tinkered with that, and Ministry, probably parked elsewhere? No clue. There's no conclusive way to state how they'd work and the evidence points towards electronics not working.

Only curious bit is the wireless radios they use and figuring out how those function.

**** Apparatition needs time to focus on where you're going, even if it's line of sight, due to the fact you're having to ensure you take your entire body with you each time and the more they do in a single run, the more they're going to wear themselves out mentally from having to ensure they take everything with them each 'port. Yes they could move most places they know about, but they muck up, especially if they're routing, they could easily cripple (maybe even kill) themselves by leaving something vital behind.

Fiendfyre might be a big power spell that can kill a lot of people, but it needs focus to prevent it turning on the caster, as Crabbe found out the hard way in canon, plus you get in close enough to direct the fire at a group of soldiers, if they've got anyone on the ball watching that direction they could wing or even kill you from a snap shot, likewise what's to stop grenades, mines or flamers from being where you appear?

In terms of disillusionment charms, once again, lovely spell, right until someone figures things out and while it /might/ allow for you to hide from both visible light and infrared/thermal, it doesn't stop your scent or sound (those are separate spells you have to apply) nor make you weightless meaning if you're not using some form of levitation aid and scent mask, animals or pressure triggers can still get you.

** I think there are two reasons why magicals wouldn't win a war against non magicals-

1. As someone else in here has said, by and large magicals have been shown to be extremely lacking in common sense. To put it bluntly, I wouldn't even trust wizards as shown in the books to be able to wipe their own asses, much less tactically plan out and execute a winning strategy in a war where they're massively outnumbered.

2. I highly doubt the lines in this war would be drawn as smoothly as all magicals vs all non magicals. There would undoubtedly be magicals, like muggleborns or others looked down upon in magical society, who chose to side with the non magicals. There would probably also be non magicals that try to side with the magicals, but they wouldn't be anywhere near as useful to the magicals as muggleborns would be to the non magicals.

I think the non magical side has enough people and the right kind of thinking to be able to think up all the not straight combat uses for magic in war, and effect measures to prepare for them. Planting magicals as security for non magical officials, planning and engaging countermeasures like wards and security features, etc.

Now I'm not saying every single magical would be incapable of the right kind of tactical thinking necessary here, but due to population numbers, the non magical side would undoubtedly win in that field as well.

If this war were straight along magical vs non magical lines, then yeah I think magic is too much of a power multiplier and game changer to be overcome, short of anything massively destructive like nuking everything. But war, and people, aren't that simple.

** Going to have to disagree on a couple of points there.

We never see in the base Harry Potter series (not discounting the stuff about Scamander or Grindelwald, but don't know what's in it) spells with city-killing abilities, or even neighbourhood killing ones.

Fiendfyre isn't really a city killer, not from a single caster. It's more like a self-mobile incendiary grenade or flamethrower team, maybe the level of a flame tank's (Churchill Crocodile, etc) flamethrower, but not on the level of even a 1kt nuclear weapon. Heck they trap it inside the Room of Requirement in DH, that's not a full on city killer even taking 'magic' into account.

The Fat Man and Little Boy nukes back in WWII were 21 and 15 /thousand/ tonnes equivalent of TNT respectively and devastated around 2 miles of terrain, causing around 50,000 casualties /each/ without getting into radiation sickness, lukemia or a host of other issues. Those were small bombs, not modern ICBMs.

The other point, a fight can be ended in 30 seconds, maybe less, on a muscle to muscle basis, and every spell a magical uses is going to be causing fatigue even if they have near unlimited magical stamina.

They're also outnumbered around 2:1 for their total population against Britain's military at the moment and most of their numbers would be civilians, not combat trained military personnel. Some of said personnel would be specialists, trained snipers capable of shooting someone from a mile, maybe up to three miles weapon and conditions dependant, away if they know where said people might show up, and can stay there for days near perfectly still and practically invisible from their own equipment.

Even presuming the magicals know where the shot comes from, there's probably several dead, plus vehicles with armour thick enough to tank most common use spells were around even 80-100 years ago, not even counting if they could get even just likely areas for a bombing run or artillery barrage for communities or lone mansions.

Would we wipe them out?

Probably only if they're stupid/insane enough to bring their entire population into the fight. More likely some would disappear underground and they wouldn't be dug out while those that fight would mostly be captured/killed.

At least unless the no bio/chem weapons laws are kept, if they aren't, it's possible some spark might figure out how to target something that makes a magical different from a normal with some sort of agent and spray that in certain areas resulting in infections, maybe killing a good number depending on how bad the thing is, how fast it spreads, mutates and runs its course and whether anyone has any natural resistance to it.

That's exactly what it is in the second FB movie! If Newt and friends hadn't intervened, all of Paris would have been lost according to Flamel. Granted, it was Grindelwald who cast the spell, with the Elder wand, but it behaved pretty much the same as Crabbe's fiendfyre when he lost control of it (which at the very least had the power to destroy the whole Room of Requirement and likely would have spread if the room hadn't been magically sealed).

*** During the first books maybe the guns would be effective, but in HBP that is reduced to a non-issue thanks to F&G shielding hats, those are essentially always active and cover the whole person, chances are that you could use a machine-gun at point-blank and it would have no effect since there is no instance of physical force beating magical shielding.

Plus the only spells we see being stopped on their tracks by physical shields are those made to deliberately target living beings, the blasting curse would be essentially a grenade-launcher with infinity munition since there was no indication of magic being limited to a reserve through the books, transfiguration don't seem to care overmuch by how big, complex or the materials that something is made of.

And lastly what makes Fiendfyre dangerous is not how big is the damage it can do instantly, it is that it can't be stopped by non-magical means like throwing water or sand and it has mobility plus sentience to seek it's own fuel, if a city is on fire by normal fire at least you can move away from anything flammable and you will be relatively safe save for unforgivable bouts of stupidity such as staying in the path of a falling building or close to a car that is on fire, plus eventually the fire will die down when there is no more fuel for it to take on it's range or when someone manages the firefighters manage to contain it, there is no such a thing with Fiendfyre, besides being able to it though any material that was on the room petty much instantaneously it also will /hunt/ it's fuel, even if it has to jump over non-inflammable things to get it, it is at least about as fast as the brooms in the Room (admittedly, not as much as a car at full-speed, but still faster than any person or animal on foot) and the more it eats through the bigger it gets, the more it is able to consume and the more fuel it seeks. It wouldn't destroy a city in a second the way nukes can, but it would grow fast with no control far past what a nuke can and no muggle would be able to stop it, that's why it is likened to nukes, except that you can't differentiate between a wizard capable or not of the spell, it gives no warning until it is cast and it takes no material to use besides a wand, the knowledge and the skill which 17 YO Crabbe managed to get his hands on.

My HC is that Voldemort was planning on training everyone from loyal families and then cast Fiendfyre over many muggle cities. With the ministry on his control and Dumbledore out of the way (which along with Snape being distrusted by the order limits hugely the light's ability to respond in time) he could theoretically wipe out most of muggle Britain in a couple of days /at the absolute most/ (eg. Assuming they would rest an hour or two between casting -though they would have no reason to- cast only during commercial hours -very OC for Voldemort- and take the time to thoroughly contain the flames after each casting -admittedly problematic).

** Something people need to understand is the Fiendfyre is not an option. It is not accessible it is an advanced dark art. Some one of the magicals better weapons comes off the table in most situations. Besides if you are specifically discussing suicide tactics you remove the ability to discount nukes from the equation. The idea of guns being superior is quite simple. A gun is faster. Always. Unless a shield charm was up prior to firing then you are killing them. Wand motions are canon. Deal with this fact. Wizards win the war though. Why? Because they don't let the war occur. This is realistic, this is why they will never come into conflict, because Wizards can literally delete knowledge. Muggle weapons can quite easily kill Wizards how is this handled? They don't make it necessary to fight.

It's most likely canon that Carrow was the most skilled at the Dark Arts besides Snape and Voldie. He was the one assigned the teaching position after all. The Slytherins all technically received special tutoring, as they were the good students.

I honestly prefer to just disregard difficult levels and assume that if someone bothers trying they will eventually succeed. Fiendfyre in particular is even more oblique because the only thing we know about it's supposed difficult level is that Hermione was afraid of trying and losing control but assumed that Crabb of all people managed it on his first try after watching his parents even if he couldn't control it, this honestly opens more questions about it's difficult than answers.

Personally I don't think this is such a good example, if I were a cop and had a shield against bullets you can bet that I would still don the bulletproof vest in case someone shots me in the back or by two different directions -you only get one life, it makes sense to be overprotective of it when going out to risk it in defense of others, so Aurors would probably still wear it even if they knew the spell.

The paper-pushers and general civilian population though are a bit more ambiguous. On one hand they don't have the /need/ to cast it on their day-to-day life, so it would make sense for them to forget or take some time to remember the spell, on the other there is no paper-pusher worse than Umbridge and she was able to cast it fast enough to deal with an arrow (admittedly not really comparable to the force of a bullet, but still it didn't show any problems stopping it). Either way the point is moot, with the shield clothing everyone is potentially walking around with a permanent protego.

Regarding the force of the shield it would probably depend on how it works and how magic works, which honestly is not nearly clear enough for us to have a discussion that doesn't either borrow heavily from other media's or from our personal head cannons, mine is that the shield spell can only be broken by other spell regardless of the impact it receives, though this is more a consequence of my own interpretation of magic being a force existing outside physics and that can't therefore be affected by physical forces regardless of the amount (a bit like inertia, only disregarding any force except magical ones), this is of course only my way of making magic being capable of affecting concepts and disregarding science co-exist with real-world science though.

***** You assume wizards live amongst wizards. Ariana Dumbledore was attacked in her backyard. They try to protect as many as they can, and while its sad, it's true they didn't particularly care for muggleborn children.

Either way, the basis of the statute of secrecy was to avoid inter-mixing of muggles and magicals to prevent conflict. Not everyone wants to fight or can fight, it solved a problem. It wasn't because wizards were weaker.

How do muggles have better talent pools? Please provide reasoning for this.

You're talking about a coordinated attack by authorities. Magicals have authorities and people to fight for them as well. I'm pretty sure they could launch coordinated attacks. They might not be able to do drone strikes as you seem to be alluding to, but they can release creatures, creates traps with potions or even dangerous plants.

Your reason for why muggles might win, is "if planned accordingly". The same argument can work for both sides. If magicals believed muggles were a threat, they could go about it and eliminate them as well in a planned manner, and likely fewer losses.

The usage of muggleborns is interesting. If they capture kids, it's useless, they'll be using an untrained, soon to become obscurial. People fed up with the ministry, fair enough.

A simple solution would be denouncing muggle-borns as a whole and going into further isolation and waiting for the right moment.

Also, using muggleborns doesn't mean muggles defeated magicals because muggles are better, but rather because muggle-borns chose to sell their magical brethren out. The victory, if it would happen, would be because of magic, not muggles.

You're also severely underestimating the ability to confound or imperious the authorities of muggles. Even if you have a muggleborn, what's the counter to a confundus or an imperio? You have the ability to control ministers and presidents with one spell. You could easily manipulate muggles into killing one another as well. Look at America.

See, if you want to talk about a fight, are we talking Witch Hunts, one on one or open war? Because in witch hunts, the muggles lost the most. One on One, wizards win. Open war, then you need to abide by rules of war, you can't touch civilians.

Only way is Genocide, where a lot of muggles will die in the identification process itself. Second, wizards won't take it lying down, the government will actively fight back and then the points I'd made earlier, come in.

I don't get your point on biological warfare? What are you trying to say? Wizards can get muggle diseases? Wizards don't have vaccines? Wizards can't cause diseases? Please elaborate.

****** The kind of attacks you mention can happen against muggles never happened in the battle at Hogwarts. If it was possible they would have done it during that battle. I don't think anyone at the Hogwarts (order or death eaters) was keeping anything back when fighting. I consider what happened at Hogwarts the most fighting any magical can do. And by greater talent pool, I meant that since muggles population is so big there will be proportional increase in talented people in many fields compared to magical world.

******* At battle of Hogwarts it was a millitia of students, teachers abd alumni against a terrorist organisation.

It's completely different from a joint, collected and concerted effort by a government. The levels of organisation are vastly different, as is their functioning.

Also the purpose of the battle of Hogwarts initially was to buy Harry time and evacuate the students. And they did use traps with respect to herbology against death eaters where they could? Not to mention the usage of creatures?

You're comparing professionals against students who barely graduated/are still in school. Right now in school, you'd probably be less than a Hogwarts student in terms of martial prowess.

If you're talking about a fight, compare equals in terms of organisation and qualifications.

And you really need to elaborate on the talent pool point as I don't see how it is relevant?

******** A group of terrorists who are able to take over an entire goverment for almost a year is defeated by a group of students and teachers. That is the level of incompetency death eaters show. Now consider that they were able to take over the magical goverment and police. So the government is worse than death eaters, and death eaters are worse than a group of students and teachers. From this I think the level of organisation for a collective effort by the ministry of magic is almost zero. You are imagining a group of soldiers with gun going against a group of wizards. Wizards don't know about anything about muggle side, so they cannot predict the way muggles will retaliate given chance, though it is same for the muggles too. But if a catastrophic event cause the muggles government to make a war, they have the element of surprise and advantage of planning and with lower population, the surviving magical may not be enough to retaliate on a huge scale. If it was easy as you say for magical to take over, why didn't they do it during the death eater rule?

********* 1. Death Eaters were attacking a highly favourable defensive position.

2. Death eaters didn't lose in the fight. They lost because their leader died. There were still many death eaters walking, who later surrendered.

3. They didn't use any strategy in attacking the castle in both instances. First time around, they didn't expect a fight. Second time around, they were cocky. Their downfall. However this doesn't reflect on their incompetency with respect to a coordinated attack.

4. You're stating that the ministry is incompetent as the death eaters are incompetent and took over them. You're conveniently overlooking the manner in which the coup was conducted. First, Amelia bones, the strongest candidate was killed off a year prior. Then they kill the less competent successor, only after having the most popular person who will succeed him, under their control. The way they orchestrated their take over was very intelligent. It can't be blamed on the ministry, because it happened from within, in a manner they honestly couldn't predict or prepare for and it was done systematically.

Also you keep stating that the muggles will have the element of surprise and the advantage. Kingsley shacklebolt was undercover with the Prime Minister for a long period and the PM wasn't even aware of it until he was informed. How difficult would it be to do it again, except this time, the PM is taken under their control or killed off for a candidate of their choosing? Wizards wouldn't even need to enter the battlefield to win the war.

You're simply dismissing the capabilities of the Ministry and Wizards on a flawed argument that they can't work together, aren't capable. They've lived and succeeded as a society for years together without the muggles even finding out. You're stating "what if they get sold out" or muggles target them - how? Pretty sure people were discontented before and tried to speak out earlier as well. They probably got buried.

Look at MACUSA. Even when real witches and wizards sold one another out, the magical side cane out on top.

As for coordinated efforts - they managed to fit a 100,000 people , from all across the world, in one moor without the muggle government ever knowing or realising and organised a world cup.

When needed, the Ministry is plenty capable.

********** I can't agree the ministry is capable, when they can't even secure strongest candidates or the minister himself against a group of terrorist. Your example says order got lucky and death eaters lack strategy and ministry was nowhere to be seen. The death eaters did loose else why would they surrender? Death of a leader will not be enough for them to change their mind and become good citizens. I don't know about MACUSA is it any other book? I am only familiar with original 7 books.

*********** How do you protect a minister from a spell that has no counter curse? Honest question. Curse him? Stun him? You'd be triggering a coup. Also who is going to say and determine that he's under an Imperious? Also how would you think the muggles can protect themselves from it?

And my point wasn't an example, that's how it played out in the books? Death of a leader ends the battle? That's how chess and battles under a monarchy/dictatorships?

Nazism was a movement under Hitler, he died, the movement died with him but the ideals continue till date? No one stated that they changed their mentality and became good. The battle ended with his death.

*** If you crossover with other movie or comic book universes, ofcource Harry Potter looses, Marvel has planetary destructive pepole and above, same with DC.

However in the Harry Potter universe, there are no other external factors at play, its 2 diffrent pepole, Wizards and Muggles, where Muggles are simply inferior.
