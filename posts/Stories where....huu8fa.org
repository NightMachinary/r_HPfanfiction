A new Dark Lord rises after Voldemort is defeated. It can be Harry himself, one of Canon characters or a Complete OC. The POV should, preferably, be from Dark Lords POV, but it also can be from the 'light side' combatants POV.

Preferably, the Dark Lord is not the generic "I have been wronged, so you must suffer, and while at it, I will conquer the world for...reasons. Grrrrrrr" type of moron who is easily countered.

Preferably long stories, but the shorter ones (20-50k) will also do.

Thanks!

P.s. Pls no M/M slash between main characters.(Such as Harry or other who had a good deal of influence in Canon, or which one we see often in other Fanfiction.)

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
