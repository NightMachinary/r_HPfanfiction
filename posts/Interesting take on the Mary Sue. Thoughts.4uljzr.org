  When I was in Ninth Grade, I won a thing.

  That thing, in particular, was a thirty dollar Barnes & Noble gift certificate. I was still too young for a part-time job, so I didn't have this kind of spending cash on me, ever. I felt like a god.

  Drunk with power, I fancy-stepped my way to my local B&N. I was ready to choose new books based solely on the most important of qualities...BADASS COVER ART. I walked away with a handful of paperbacks, most of which were horrible (I'm looking at you, Man-Kzin Wars III) or simply forgettable.

  One book did not disappoint. I fell down the rabbit hole into a series that proved to be as badass as the cover art promised (Again, Man-Kzin Wars III, way to drop the ball on that one). With more than a dozen books in the series, I devoured them. I bought cassette tapes of ballads sung by bards in the stories. And the characters. Oh, the characters. I loved them. Gryphons, mages, but most importantly, lots of women. Different kinds of women. So many amazing women. I looked up to them, wrote bad fiction that lifted entire portions of dialogue and character descriptions, dreamed of writing something that the author would include in an anthology.

  This year I decided in a fit of nostalgia to revisit the books I loved so damn much. I wanted to reconnect with my old friends...

  ...and I found myself facing Mary Sues. Lots of them. Perfect, perfect, perfect. A fantasy world full of Anakin Skywalkers and Nancy Drews and Wesley Crushers. I felt crushed. I had remembered such complex, deep characters and didn't see those women in front of me at all anymore. Where were those strong women who kept me safe through the worst four years of my life?

  Which led me to an important realization as I soldiered on through book after book. That's why I needed them. Because they were Mary Sues. These books were not written to draw my attention to all the ugly bumps and whiskers of the real world. They were somewhere to hide. I was painfully aware that I was being judged by my peers and adults and found lacking. I was a fuckup. And sometimes a fuckup needs to feel like a Mary Sue. As an adult, these characters felt a little thin because they lacked the real world knowledge I, as an adult, had learned and earned. But that's the thing...these books weren't FOR this current version of myself. Who I am now doesn't need a flawless hero because I'm comfortable with the idea that valuable people are also flawed.

  There is a reason that most fanfiction authors, specifically girls, start with a Mary Sue. It's because girls are taught that they are never enough. You can't be too loud, too quiet, too smart, too stupid. You can't ask too many questions or know too many answers. No one is flocking to you for advice. Then something wonderful happens. The girl who was told she's stupid finds out that she can be a better wizard than Albus Dumbledore. And that is something very important. Terrible at sports? You're a warrior who does backflips and Legolas thinks you're THE BEST. No friends? You get a standing ovation from Han Solo and the entire Rebel Alliance when you crash-land safely on Hoth after blowing up the Super Double Death Star. It's all about you. Everyone in your favorite universe is TOTALLY ALL ABOUT YOU.

  I started writing fanfiction the way most girls did, by re-inventing themselves.

  Mary Sues exist because children who are told they're nothing want to be everything.

  As a girl, being “selfish” was the worst thing you could be. Now you live in Narnia and Prince Caspian just proposed marriage to you. Why? Your SELF is what saved everyone from that sea serpent. Plus your hair looks totally great braided like that.

  In time, hopefully, these hardworking fanfiction authors realize that it's okay to be somewhere in the middle and their characters adjust to respond to that. As people grow and learn, characters grow and learn. Turns out your Elven Mage is more interesting if he isn't also the best swordsman in the kingdom. Not everyone needs to be hopelessly in love with your Queen for her to be a great ruler. There are all kinds of ways for people to start owning who they are, and embracing the things that make them so beautifully weird and complicated.

  Personally, though, I think it's a lot more fun learning how to trust yourself and others if you all happen to be riding dragons.

*TL;DR: Mary Sues make for bad literature, but they're written by girls who write flawless version of themselves because they haven't yet learned that it's okay to be flawed and that flawed people have value.*

I thought it was really insightful, and it changed the way I think about Mary Sues.

The author writes about girls because she's speaking from her experience, but this applies equally to boys. The fantasies in question just tend to differ in the details.

*** It's true, most of the insanely OP Harry fics I've come across have been written by guys. I wonder if it's just anecdotal, or if girls are more prone to making original Mary Sues and guys are more prone to Sueifying canon characters.

*** I think it's also that people are WAY more likely to jump on female characters for being Mary Sues than they are to jump on male characters for being Gary Stus. Honestly even in OP!Harry fics, or harem fics, or whatever, the complaint is "Harry is too powerful" or whatever, and not "Harry is a Gary Stu/Mary Sue!". When it's a female character the first complaint always seems to be "Mary Sue!!!" which, is honestly just another insane standard women are held to even in fictional literature. If we're overpowered it's a huge terrible trope, not just one fixable issue which is often how it's presented if it's a male character. I'm talking strictly how people react here, not how the characters were written. If I went through a fic with a huge Mary Sue and changed her into a male character, I have a feeling that specific criticism would drop off substantially...

**** I don't think it's so much an insane standard women are held to, as it is people being too lax on overpowered male characters. Any overpowered Sue/Stu-like character (whether male or female) /is/ a huge, terrible trope that should be treated accordingly because it's awful writing that can ruin even the best plot. That male characters aren't treated that way is just bizarre to me.

Then again, I think a lot of the acceptance for OP-Harry and harem-fics is flow-over from the anime subculture that fanfiction is associated with, because animes with OP main characters and harem plots are fairly well-established in those circles.

***** That's a really interesting point about anime flowover that I hadn't considered but I think you've definitely got something there. I haven't watched a lot of anime or interacted much with the fandom but from what I have seen that would make a lot of sense to me.

I do though still think it's a pretty insane standard - and especially when you consider that most people writing Mary Sues are (from my experience, and I would wager in general) are young girls. This post notes why and I think it's spot on in saying that. But it doesn't cover the fallout of people jumping down author's throats or otherwise not reading what could be good works of fiction, and may lead to discouraging young women from fandom writing or writing in general, and I am just not about anything that discourages someone (especially girls) from trying out something they may be interested in.

I know this is going to sound insensitive, and I don't want you to feel like I'm attacking your opinion. That being said, I feel like getting used to criticism is something you have to learn as an author, young or old, male or female. You could write War and Peace meets Ulysses, but there's going to be someone out there who thinks it's shit and is unafraid to tell you they think it's shit. This isn't something that's unique to adolescent girls who write Mary Sues, every writer has faced a cacophony of unfiltered, unconstructive criticism before. It's a pain that people jump down your throat, but if a couple of dicks shouting at you is enough to discourage you from writing, then you shouldn't be writing.

As for not reading what could be good works of fiction. Being ignored is one of the worst feelings a writer can have, perhaps even more so than being flamed, but you can't really blame the readers for their lack of interest, can you? Reader interest isn't something an author can demand; it's why we look so poorly on writers who demand a certain amount of reviews before they release their next chapter. The fact is that fanfiction, and the HP archive especially, has a huge fandom, and you only get a few chances to impress when there's another story just a few clicks away. If you're writing a Mary Sue, you're not going to be forgiven for being young, your fic will be ignored because it's not a good story.

** I'm trying to think, but I believe every beloved childhood character of mine had faults.

Harry Potter was a bit too hotheaded and rushed off before thinking things through. Ron was too caught up in self-pity, and Hermione was too sure of herself and the belief that she was always right.

Hercules wanted to be a hero, but he didn't know the true meaning of the word until he was forced to make a life and death choice.

In Narnia, Edmund was a massive attention seeking brat before he grew into the valiant man that he was. In order to be so fair and just, he had to grow from the experience of betraying his loved ones. Susan was vain and bitter, and it cost her her place in heaven. Lucy grew too attached to family, sometimes to the detriment of others who needed her help more. Peter was a brave king, but even kings had lapses in judgement and could have trouble accepting help or letting others take charge.

Simba had to face his own guilt and inner hatred in order to become the one true king.

Tarzan had to learn about human cruelty in the worst possible way, because he was too trusting and naive, even when warned of his faults.

In Animorphs, each of the main characters was so caught up in their personal ideologies that it caused rifts. Jake was too self sacrificing, Cassie was too soft and lenient, Rachel was too hard and brash, Marco didn't take things with enough seriousness sometimes, Tobias was a broken child who locked himself into a bird form because he didn't belong anywhere, and Ax was constantly fighting between his duties on earth to his friends and his duties as an Andalite warrior to his superiors.

Even Ramona Quimby was an infuriating child who never stopped annoying those around her as she grew up learning about life.

Katniss Everdeen and Tris Prior were constantly fighting a battle within themselves as much as they are fighting a battle outside. Of course I've read these books as an adult, but their main demographic is young adult girls.

I read so many books as a child I'm only highlighting the big ones that I remember, but I can't recall a single Mary Sue in all my readings. Every character had their faults, and that was what made them relatable. It's what allowed me to get lost in these books because even if their worlds were fantastic and unrealistic, they weren't. If they were perfect, the stories would just be boring and flat. They had real issues within themselves that made their triumph even more resounding.

*** Squee! Another Animorphs fan.

Oh, and Marco put too little emphasis on emotions and doing the right thing, choosing instead to emphasize "the bright clear line," focusing on the ends. He thought he could be Machiavellian enough to push his mother off a cliff to off Vissers One and Three, only to be foiled at the last minute by his own incompetence.

Jake also had a thing about appearing stoic, and never letting the people you're leading see your self-doubt, which led to a lot of preventable deaths in the final arc, since he didn't bother to have his plan looked over by Marco and Ax. (He was also distressed at the time, thanks to his parents being taken.)

Anyway, Bella Swan was totally bland, so the reader could insert themselves into her shoes easier, yet every guy wanted her. I guess, if you're looking for unintended flaws, she was manipulative and didn't really care for the people around her. She's also supposed to be clumsy.

Tris, I'll admit isn't totally perfect, but was special because of what she was and not what she did, but I do remember her having a fear of intimacy and constantly worrying if she didn't fit her faction well enough.

Percy Jackson could be too loyal to a fault.

It was Tally's (from Uglies) fear of the pills that would undo the damage done to her that led to a possible boyfriend being put into grave danger, and she was a little too trusting of her society, never showing the skepticism her friend Shay did until really late.

**** My gender really doesn't have anything to do with this. But if you want to make this into a tumblr battle on injustices, I'm a person of color, so hey, I'm covered because I'm not a white male. I'm told I'm worthless and less of a person every single day by the mass media, and there wasn't a single book that told me any different. Somehow I've managed not to adore and write about Mary-Sues, though.

And yes, I'm forgetting the bad books and remembering the good ones, because I don't tend to read bad books with bad characters. The entire point of the tumblr post was that she loved the books and characters as a child because the characters were perfect, and in her world of imperfection, that was something that spoke to her.

But I'm confused. In this post you've just implied that Mary-Sues make for bad books and bad characters. What about my post are you disagreeing with?

***** Of course gender is relevant, that's what the post is about and what everyone in the thread (both men and women) are talking about. And I'm not disagreeing with you about the value of characters like Ramona and Lucy. I'm merely suggesting that there's far more bad reading material as well. No one's saying that your experience is invalid. But if you really thought gender didn't matter, you have mentioned it in your original comment instead of presenting your own experience as comparable to the original writers. Your experience is valid, but should be presented in comparison with the OP's (as that of a non-white male), not direct dissent to her equally valid perspective as a woman.

As a girl who has been a voracious reader since I was a child, I can tell you that for every Lucy and Ramona, there's 10 bland female children's book characters. And for every Hermione Granger and Katniss Everdeen, there's 10 pretty bland wish fulfillment teenage girl characters. And in any case, as a girl, you're exposed to a lot of literature where female characters are sidelined or non-existent. Boys tend to be a lot more nuanced.

** It's a cool post, but I don't think it's bringing new insight so much as it's an anecdote confirming what we already know about people who write Mary Sues. We already know that the Mary Sue/Gary Stu is terrible writing, and we know they're generally written by teens who haven't had enough life experience to write nuanced characters and understand why they're more compelling than flawless ones, or are using fanfiction as an escape from daily problems.

As for gender, I think it should be noted that girls aren't the only ones guilty of writing Mary Sues. Boys are taught to be manly, charismatic, and self-sufficient, and it's really hard to live up to that role when you're fifteen and asking your dad for lunch money. So a lot of teenage guys live out that power-fantasy of being the "ultimate man" out on paper, hence the super-OP Harry fics where he dominates over his friends, enemies, love interests, etc. Much like the Mary Sue is a cry from a female writer to be accepted, the Gary Stu is a cry from the male writer to be respected. It's sad, because they do this without realising that most of adult men are equally flawed as them; we're just old enough to be able to put up a good front.
