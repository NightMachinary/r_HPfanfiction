I have seen this fic mentioned before in this sub I can't seem to find it, its about the older brother of the Boy who Live >!who Dumbledore had join the Death Eaters!< (I heard that this is a spoiler so I put it under spoiler tag just in case)

if there is any good fic where Harry is the older brother of the BWL please recommend me anyways thanks

edit: I have found the reddit post that mentioned this fic but it wasn't linked [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5s2fw9/lf_terminally_ill_harry/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf]]


** Here are 2 where he is a double agent:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9276562/1/The-Trial]]

I think in the first one he is ill.

*** I just read double agent and I really enjoyed it do you have any that is similar to that? Preferably not a one shot but this was such a gem I don't know how I have never heard of this story before.

** I have one where it's a female oc who is raised as Harry's adopted older sister who joins de with the help of her uncle regulus though, not Dumbledore, who tries his best to undermine what she has planned to keep Harry and her other adopted brother Neville safe from the de and voldy.
