Question in title


** In truth the quality of a lot of fanfiction is low, but WBWL fics get a little help in that department. Oftentimes a WBWL fic develops a large amount of character bashing. They need to explain why Harry is treated differently than the Boy Who Lived. This character bashing can be egregious, out of character, or even nonsensical. Dealing with the drama and manufactured angst can wear out a story quickly if it doesn't feel earned.

These stories also have a tendency towards adhering to stations of canon. The end result is original Harry Potter with a new angsty abused coat of paint.

** Because the whole premise is flawed:

- In canon, Harry's parents sacrificed for him
- But in those fics, they suddenly become child abusers?! How fucked up is that?

** I think a lot of it could be handled a lot better, but mostly people just use it as kind of a power fantasy/to change things.

I feel a good WBWL story would have different aspects than what we normally see. For example rather than outright neglect it's more like what happens when a sibling is seriously ill/has ongoing medical conditions. Maybe the backlash from the killing curse means their magic responds to everything as a threat and tries to protect them? and so they need appointments or tests to try and fix the issue/get them used to magic so they can go back to normal. (Normal for a wizard.)

The sibling might get more attention but I've always felt like Lily and James would try their best but they are human after all. I feel like they would make efforts to ensure Harry doesn't feel neglected (reading with lily maybe or flying with James, basically anything to make them spend time with him) but they can be tired from looking after the sibling so can't always fully engage.

Sibling who have grown up in this environment can be neglected and it always struck me as more realistic than them just dumping him with the Dursleys or neglecting him for no reason.

** Anytime stories try to adhere to a 'trope' (manipulative!Dumbledore, WBWL!Harry, PotionQueen!Molly) they are really just ripping off the one or two good stories that created the trope.

In general, if the story is going to be good, it will be its own independent idea, not some tired rehash of an idea someone already did better. Right now, WBWL is the 'in' thing; everyone's shitting out their own version, and pretty much none of them bar PoS and DP&SW are worth the time it takes to even read the summary.

*** I think this is probably correct. I remember when grey!Harry was the in thing and I read one that was great and then the next few I read were just sooo bad. Same with the lordship/political phase which has translated into so many bad Slytherin!Harry ones. See also Severitus, they don't actually tend to be "bad" but they get so utterly boring and OOC a lot of the time.

But yeah I read a couple of WBWL a while ago and thought they were utter trash, then someone on here pointed me to PoS and I finally "got" why people read WBWL. Where can I find Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches, I keep seeing it recommended?

****** It's 'different,' just 'some things were taken'. It's like saying fem!Ghostbusters was "inspired" by the 1980s original, rather than existing directly because of it. Anyone that can write a, what, 200k word story could have come up with something on their own.

But whatever, it's fanfiction. They're all just playing with JKR's toys.

** A lot of what others have said in this thread, as well as there tends to be a lot of copy and pasting, or just derivative re-writes of other stories in this genre. So the bad fics multiply exponentially as people who read them enjoy them, and write almost perfect facsimiles of them and post.

** Bashing, power trips on part of the writer, and the over-reliance on tired, very bland tropes and cliches that are often shittily written anyway. Most peter out pretty quickly because beyond the initial 'set-up' and bashing, the writers just stare gormlessly at the word document because, "shit, now what do I write?".

So, yeah.

** Have you read /Corvus/? I'm on about chapter 28 and it seems better than most, despite the Dumbledore bashing. And /Prince of Slytherin/ is the best one I've read so far, but it's still in progress.

As for why the quality is low, most fics contain a /lot/ of bashing, so if you don't like bashing, that may be the reason.

** It all depends on taste actually. One reader can find Dramoine awesome while someone like me can find it disgusting. In the same way someone like you can find WBWL to be bad while it may be a guilty pleasure to others.

The premise is flawed but there are flaws in all tropes. Like

Time travel:Seriously Hermione is sent back in them just so she can be paired with others.

Dramoine:A guy who looks down on muggleborns, a spoilt brat suddenly falls in love with the muggleborn he repeatedly bullied and called slurs.

Harmoine:It is comparable to incest in my eyes.
