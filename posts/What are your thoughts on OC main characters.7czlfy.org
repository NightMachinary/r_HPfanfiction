I'm currently in the final stages of outlining my first fanfic. However, it just occured to me that most of the fanfics i've read have had few if no OC characters. let alone main characters. I'm actually really proud of the character I made and she fits in quite well to the universe. I'd still like a second opinion though. :) Are there any tips/do's and don'ts that pertain to OC content?


** I'm not sure tbh. On the one hand, fanfiction has taken characters and just remade them in their own image so much that most of them are OC with a canon name. On the other hand I've read stories with OCs which are just atrocious. American wizard kids or really cool and beautiful and amazing and hot and sooooo talented people etc.

*** Hey, thanks for taking the time to reply. All good stuff. Yes, I've come to the realization that I tend to not read OC content because it becomes quite unrealistic. It's funny you mention Daphne Greengrass, I've just written a bit about her. My character /could/ fit into Daphne's shoes, but I've tied my OC with another pureblood character. I just enjoy the creative freedom that comes with writing my own characters. Thanks again, you've given me confidence to finish developing this fic.

**** To add on to [[/u/AutumnSouls]], not only should your OC have flaws, but those flaws should have consequences. Harry bottles up his feelings and explodes, Hermione gets too intense and turns away the elves, Ron gets jealous in fourth year and jumps ship.

A Mary Sue is still a Mary Sue if she has flaws and nothing comes of them.

God of the machine is a saying to say "a person or thing (as in fiction or drama) that appears or is introduced suddenly and unexpectedly and provides a contrived solution to an apparently insoluble difficulty." Instead, I replaced "Dues" with "bff" to show that the best friend is simply there to solve to unsolveable.

** The most important thing in my mind is necessity. Does the OC need to be there? Sometimes I feel the OC is a poorly disguised self insert which brings me to the second issue I have with a lot of OCs. Knowledge, what are they expected to know? Ignorance is a must, them knowing things they shouldn't or making decisions based of knowledge of the HP books will have me close the tab instantly.

With regards to the necessity part, you have to ask what they contribute? How does your story benefit from their presence. The best OC characters in my opinion are Calypso Rosier from the Santi's Harry Potter and the boy who lived and the MC of linkffn(11111990). Both are needed. One fills the friend role, the other is what the story is based around, it poses an interesting question rather than how would I beat Voldemort better? If they exist merely to push your own views into the existing HP world then they'll be poorly received here but might be popular on FFN.

** I usually avoid fics with OC main characters since the vast majority I have come across have been absolutely terrible self inserts/Mary sues. I find it a lot harder to care about them too since they usually aren't too well written and people just tend to use them as an excuse to write how they themselves would act in certain situations. Even better ones often come with involved backgrounds and powers that I just can't bring myself to care about. Its strange though because fics with side character OCs, even OC's that are main characters children, or canon named, but barely known characters that may as well have been OCs I find compeletely fine.

Just don't try to shoehorn your character into main events and friendships with the trio without a good reason. Things shouldn't be set up just so the OC can join the gang and fight the troll or whatever and then become their best friend the next day. They also shouldn't be so amazing that everyone from Harry to Draco to characters that are known to hate everyone forget their personality and love them and become their friend.

** OCs in fan fiction are interesting. Most people that read fan fiction are looking for familiar characters in new situations. My own works tend to have several OCs, but they are not the focus of the story. One exception is Teddy. I just completed a [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12132915][Teddy-centric story]] and while he's a named character in canon, we hardly know anything about him, so he might as well be an OC.

I agree with most of the other posters--make the character interesting and flawed, not just author wish-fulfillment. Give them a quirk, something to make them memorable.

** for me it really depends on several things if I like an OC main character.

Does the story play in Hogwarts at the time the trio is in Hogwarts? I probably would prefer following canon characters over following an OC. (there have been exceptions)

Is the OC just suddendly becoming the best friend / lover of canon characters? No thanks!

On the other hand, though, I love stories that play in different parts of the magical world and do not mind reading about a whole set of OCs who go to school in the USA ( think things like the Alexandra Quick series). I also like stories which play in another time period to canon and am fine having OCs in those stories, too. ( though I also like stumbling over canon characters...)

Basically, I am fine with OCs if they are paret of wider world builduing in a way.

Of course I won't like /every/ OC tin every elsewhere fic or historical story. some I may feel are too overpowered or too much of a self insert, while in other cases the writing and characterisation may be great but I just don't like the person the writing depicts.

** Some people are resistant to OCs and they aren't going to read your story. It doesn't matter what you do, they aren't interested. So don't worry about it.

Honestly, the OC factor is not nearly as important as some people would have you believe. I've written stories with an OC main character and OC/CC pairing and stories with OCs who are just side characters and one with CCs only and there's no significant difference in reader stats across the board. In fact my OC stories generally get slightly more reads. As long as you are passionate about your own story, I'm sure you'll do absolutely fine.

** I am... Not a big fan of those. I'm not a big fan of OCs as a whole, although there have been some absolutely smashing ones in fics I've read.

But there's always the risk of the OC being a cuddly American who becomes BFFs with everyone and... Yeah.

I definitely don't trust American OFCs. Ever. At all.
