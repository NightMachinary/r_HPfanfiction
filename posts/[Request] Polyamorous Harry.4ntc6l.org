I'm tired of reading Harry x every girl in the series where they're all in a relationship with /just/ Harry.

Is there any Harry x Multi, probably only two, where it's a three way relationship instead of one guy in multiple relationships?


** Harry/Hermione/Ron or trio shipping as they call it? Interested, or not your cup of tea where any trio fic will inevitably feature some slash between Harry and Ron?

  COMPLETE. James Potter casts his own spell to protect his only son; but he was never as good with Charms as Lily was. (A more ruthless Harry Potter grows up to confront Voldemort). Dark!Harry. Slytherin!Harry HP/HG and then HP/HG/TN.

** Harry/Hermione/Ron is my favorite non-canon pairing. But there are very few good fics about it. [[http://archiveofourown.org/collections/triofic/works]] has 95, but none of them good imho.

*Just The Three of Them*, linkffn(6807742), is nice, but only an one-shot.

*The Sum of Their Parts*, linkffn(11858167), is great, but their relationship is implicit.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  Harry has only ever loved Ron and Hermione, Ron only loved Harry and Hermione, and Hermione only loved Harry and Ron. so why should there ever be more than just the three of them?

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny

**** Actually, I think there was a response to the same challenge with this pairing, though from I enjoyed it less than this.

Also, maybe linkao3(4623819)?

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him.
