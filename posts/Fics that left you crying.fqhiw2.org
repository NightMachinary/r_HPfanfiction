Let's talk about the fics that made you cry. Scenes that were so heart breaking that it left you in tears.

These two are fics that left me truly heartbroken

The first is a one shot which ive not been able to find for sometime. It's a WBWL fic. Had all the cliches of the trope, but this one left such an impact on me. The fic is from Harry's POV how everyone around him ignores him, he is so dejected at the end that he runs away from his home on a very cold night and freezes to death. This is a very very young harry and the author writes the child anguish with such beauty.

I guess the fics name was missing. But I've not been able to find it for a while now

The 2nd is from the fic fixing past mistakes linkffn(fixing past mistakes). I literally cried during Harry's funeral and when "somewhere over the rainbow" starts playing. It was so sad and so sk very heartbreaking to read that.

Most stories use rape and abuse just for some cheap angst. This one though... you have to read it. Not only is it so believable, but also the writing style is incredibly similar to J.K. Rowlings and everyone seems perfectly in-character.

  Harry's doing just fine: being Quidditch Captain and 'the Chosen One' doesn't leave him with time to worry about much besides school and the growing threat of war. He's especially not worrying about the fact that Sirius is dead. Or about an embarrassing, uncomfortable night with a classmate he'd rather just forget. Really. He's fine.

** I second both Cauterize and Stages of Hope; great fics.

linkffn(I Know Not, And I Cannot Know - Yet I Live and I Love) is just a beautiful fic, and that's all I'll say. Definitely read this one.

linkffn(Catechism; Friends by the psychotic house-elf) were fics that take abuse/cruelty to kind of an extreme, but unlike most of that type, are done well.

Slash:

- The classic [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewseries.php?seriesid=29][If You Are Prepared]] series by Cybele (HP/SS). To be honest, I've only read it once, so all I really remember is that it was a really good story and I sobbed my heart out so much I'm not sure I could take it again.
- [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewstory.php?sid=290][The Last Dance]] by Sushi (HP/SS)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10785525][No Happy Memories]] by Amanuensis (HP/SB). Not a pairing I usually read, but this is so heartbreakingly awesome.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/539949][Our Tree]] by Dacro (HP/DM)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9471506][The Park Bench]] by plumeria (HP/DM)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7876180][The Return]] by Kulfold (HP/SS)
- I wish I could also link The Sensible Garden by RaeWhit (HP/SS), but she's apparently purged most of her HP fanfic. I have it saved in Word, if anybody wants a copy.)

  When Harry Potter unintentionally severs their soulbond before it can fully form, Draco Malfoy resigns himself to a slow death and decides not to burden Harry with a soulmate he's made it very clear he doesn't want.He's never been selfless before, but for Harry, he can try.

  Harry didn't appear at Hogwarts causing concern. Albus immediately head's out to Privet Drive to find out what was going on, along with Minerva and a reluctant Severus Snape. What they find out changes everything for everyone in the wizarding world. Is there a chance for anyone to go back and fix past mistakes? is there any hope at all for the magical world? COMPLETE

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1067936][Gryffindor tie(s) by Amaru_Katari]], but really, it is about suicide and it is not gentle description, so if you can be triggered by something like this, I don't recommend it. For others, yes, it is pretty rough.

Also, linkao3(Holly at Hogwarts--From Sir, with Love by Forest_of_Holly) from the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts]] series. This probably won't affect everyone as much, but for me it was the most horrible thing I have ever read. And yes, in quarantine, there is enough time, so read whole series. Some, parts are better than others, but it is definitively worthy of reading (also, the third volume is tough and great).
