Alot of newer fandoms are primarily on AO3, and there are older fandoms that may have initially posted fics on FF.net, have started to post primarily on AO3 for any new content. But as far as I can tell the Harry Potter fandom uses both sites fairly frequently even now.

So for HP fanfics specifically what site do you prefer to read fics on and why? Also do you notice a difference for the type of fics on Ao3 vs FF.net? ( apart from FF.net having older HP fics and fewer fics with adult content).


** I browse both. Ao3 has fewer restrictions on what is acceptable literature. FFN has a much larger reader base.

** It all depends on you.

AO3 can be difficult to browse at times, although the new exclude search function really helps it along, even if the kinks need to be kicked out of it. AO3 also has, in my opinion, mostly slash, so if that's not your cup of tea then it's hard to get around.

[[https://FF.net][FF.net]] on the other hand has 2 decades worth of work and an easy search function. FF also has the C2's that allow you to easily find something new to read while only searching through stories that would interest you.

Personally I use both, but FF will always have a special place in my heart as the first website that I both read and posted fanfiction on. Also it's a lot easier to keep track of your favourite stories on FF.

** Style-wise I prefer AO3, but the sheer amount of Drarry over there puts me off a bit. There's also far less fics there. I also find the tagging system a bit confusing, and sometimes it doesn't actually give 100% of the results. Not sure what's going on.

Then again, I've found out that the same thing can happen on FFN, with fics being hidden from search results.

** I usually avoid AO3 except I have a recommendation for a particular story. The search function doesn't work properly. It's hard to find a story without Malfoy, no matter how often you exclude his name in the search. And sorry, I can't stand this cowardly piece of ###.

** I prefer Ao3. It's easier to search and I have found that there tends to be better stories in general than on FFN.

Ao3 tends to have a lot more originality in my opinion-but that may be because different tropes are on Ao3 compared to FFN (and I am more familiar with FFN tropes after initially reading on FFN).

**** Seven Names-AU version of the war. Interesting premise.

Tell Brave Deeds of War-also on FFN. Set during Deathly Hallows, follows three Ravenclaws.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/288347/chapters/460378][The Rewards of Peseverance]] /Mirror of Erised-AU Voldemort wins. (Didn't seem to link)

It's Tea Time Series-slash (Scorpius/Albus)-very enjoyable and somehow perfectly nailed Ron, Hermione, Harry and Ginny. Also on FFN, but third one is an Ao3 exclusive.

Registration-absolutetly hilarious.

to welcome you home-amazing, very sweet and funny. Harry, Ron and Hermione go back to Hogwarts (post-war oneshot)

Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run-surprsingly great Draco/Harry. AU where Harry never goes to the Hogwarts

Lost Among Our Winnings-bunch of good post-war oneshots.

Thirty Years On: The Man Behind the Mystery-absolutely hilarious. Captures the characters so well too.

Professor C. Binns: A Personal History-I would never have expected a story about Professor Hinks to be one of my favourite fics, but this really is amazing.

Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood-also on HPFF. Very enjoyable mystery.

Five Facts You Won't Find in "Hogwarts, A History"-great series of oneshots.

  Transcribed from back cover of book:  Professor Cuthbert Binns (living: 1865-1963, haunting: 1963- ) is the leading Magical Historian of his day. He has published widely on topics ranging from, 'The origins of magic in native rock art,' to 'Wizard-Muggle relations through the ages', and was awarded an Order of Merlin (second class) in 1936, when his seminal work, 'A History of the magical world in 100,000 pages' became the best-selling Historical text on record.  This volume, however, is - for the first time - autobiographical in nature. It is thus also somewhat experimental in nature, but serves to remind both the author and the reader that we each build the fabric of History, in our own ways, however small.  Author: C. Binns. Dictation: Gluey the House elf.Production: A.P.W.B. Dumbledore, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,Published, 1964; Revised, 1991.

Once, over the course of two memorable weeks, an escaped Chizpurfle wreaked havoc inside the castle. “A what?” Ron whispered, when it was announced at dinner.“A Chizpurfle,” Hermione hissed back. “Newt Scamander wrote about them in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. They're small crab-like parasites that feed off larger creatures like Augureys and Crups, but they're also attracted to leftover potions and objects with high magical concentrations.” “My mam told me about them,” Seamus Finnigan said darkly. “She said once when I was little, we had a Chizpurfle infestation in our house. Turns out they were after her wand and some of the rare spellbooks she kept in the attic.”“They eat wands?” Harry asked, horrified.“Yeah. Mam told the neighbors it was rats.

***** I haven't read rewards of preservence since high school probably(?) and I was just thinking about reading it again so this is perfect. From my recollection I would definitely second it's recommendation.

** I prefer Ao3 as both a writer and a reader, the site design is better, submitting a fic, and review is easier, and you have more control over your fanfiction.

FFnet is decent to read on, but if I have the choice between Ao3 and FF I will pick Ao3.
