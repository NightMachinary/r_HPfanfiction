Just finished re-reading the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/309447][Mischief's Heir]] series and oh my god I absolutely love it!! Easily one of the /best/ Thor/Marvel x HP crossovers. It's well written, and has a very original and interesting plotline. The characters show such good development and growth throughout the series, and there's very, very minimal bashing (Ron and Hermione in the first book and Ginny in some scenes). I love the sciency magic/magicky science (scagic, hehe) in the books. And Harry as a lightly mad scientist? Perfection.

The basic plot is that Harry and Neville start a club, and then it evolves into a space travel club, which leads to the mass migration of the entire wizarding community throughout the world to a whole new planet.(called Valinor!!!) I seriously cannot rec this series enough. It has Harry and Tom Riddle as brothers (Loki adopts both of them!), a bit of slash (Wood/Flint) and the relationships between the characters are very well written and realistic. Frigga, Sigyn, Odin, Thor, Tony, Steve, Dr. Strange, Peggy and a whole lotta characters also appear from book 3 onwards. In a side-ish plot, Hydra is found out and SHIELD tries to eliminate them.

Side note, if anybody has recommendations for Mad Scientist Harry, please link them. Thanks!

The fics: linkao3(Say a Prayer by mad_fairy); linkao3(Dream a Dream by mad_fairy); linkao3(Make a Plan by mad_fairy); linkao3(Talk the Talk by mad_fairy); linkao3(Walk the Walk by mad_fairy)


** I wholeheartedly agree that this is one of the best fics out there.

*** XD same! the author literally tagged it 'wacky crossover that goes in unexpected directions' so I prolly should've expected it, but I was unprepared for the sheer wacky-ness, hehe

  A plot bunny that stuck to my head. One shot. Rated M to be safe for mentioning sex.Rin and Sesshomaru had some reflections on their first encounter, when she had poured water on his head (in the manga). I wanted to explore how they would think of Rin's bold move back then in their later years together.
