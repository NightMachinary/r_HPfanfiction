  Al's dad told him that Slytherin was all right, and that means it isn't fair how people treat them. Al's realized he has to fix this.

** You'd have to Google for it, but James potter and the hall of elder's crossing does have an albus sorted into slytherin (although the focus is on James in gryffindor). The only next gen fic I liked that has albus as the main character is linkffn(albus potter and the global revelation), which is a readable if not great fic, although albus is a gryffindor. Delicate, over on harrypotterfanfiction.net has a Slytherin Albus, but the focus ia on Rose.

*** I understand your hatred of the Cursed Child, but please don't other threads were people are actually seeking help. Your post, in a sense, contributed nothing to the actual thread.

As for OP, are you looking for slash or not?
