Here's the plot summary:

"In 1857 England, Rose Peabody and her family are captivated by the testimonies of two Mormon Muggle missionaries, and are baptized as members of the LDS church. Deciding to leave behind their comfortable wizarding home to join their fellow Saints in the Salt Lake Valley, the Peabodys embark across the sea and the American wilderness on a journey - one that will test them both physically and spiritually."

** To be brutally honest, probably not. I think it's a really interesting idea for original fiction, whether you included a fantasy element or not. But there's a reason I read Harry Potter fanfic - I want more of the Harry Potter world. I want characters and settings I recognise. A few fics, like Alexandra Quick, manage to be compelling enough to gain popularity despite having so little connection to the original series (though I still couldn't get into it). But these are rare and need to come from an author who has already established themselves.

I had a skim through your writing and the actual quality of it is very good, so I don't see why you wouldn't just write it as an original work.

*** Yeah, the fanfics I write tend to be set in the HP world, but not revolve around the characters from the story. I like to make up my own characters with their own storyline. In this one, for instance, there are several allusions to recognizable wizarding terms (Hogwarts, Merlin, Ministry of Magic, Ilvermorny, etc.), but it's set in an entirely different time period with new characters.

***** My goal for this story wasn't so much to focus on the wizarding world and magic as it was to demonstrate the effects religion can have on a family, and what it's like to go through an existential crisis. The HP elements were thrown in because I'm obsessed with the series, and I thought it would be interesting to write from the perspective of a Mormon witch. I wanted Rose and her family to be relatable to the average person, but also show their differences, being wizards.

****** Exactly, they're not the focus of the story - they're barely there at all. Most people looking for HP fanfic to read won't be interested in reading this, because it essentially isn't HP fanfic.

Someone looking for new historical or spiritual fiction to read, on the other hand, would probably be very interested in this. Personally I think you would get more readers and feedback posting it as original fiction.

** Now I haven't read it all because it's on Wattpad which I hate, but I'll make a couple of observations.

I'm massively in favour of fics that move outside the box in original and inventive ways and writing in a historical setting is a good way of doing this, but as others have said, this apparently moves so far away from Rowling's world that apart from a couple of fairly generic references, there is nothing recognisable here.

This does not need to be a fanfiction! You could very easily 'file off the serial numbers' (in fact it reads almost as if the 'serial numbers' are there as an afterthought anyway), and give yourself the freedom of having an original story you can publish anywhere.

Yes, a lot of people are telling me that this doesn't need to be branded as a Harry Potter fic, but having it set in the wizarding world was kind of the whole point for me. Maybe you haven't gotten too far into the story yet, but magic does play a significant role in how the plot develops. I thought it would be interesting to write about faith from a magical perspective.

** Read this fic before you judge it. Seriously. I'm not religious at all these days, but I'm not going to let that stop me from reading something, fic or original, that deals with the topic. My imagination would be the poorer for it if I didn't -- so would my possible reading material. And I'm not going to lie, the subject interests me (I have an atheist's keen fascination with religion).

Anyway, I'm glad that I didn't pass this fic by.

The premise is unique -- you don't really see a lot of fics dealing with religion and having it feel /real/. And you rarely, if ever, find one dealing with the LDS church/Mormonism. The writing is good, a cut above most -- and it calls back to 19th century novels in the way that time skips are handled, for instance, and the general feel of the writing. I like the touches of magical worldbuilding that are right there from the very start. There are also, as expected, historical references too.

The main viewpoint character of Rose feels very real to me -- OCs often aren't, so that's an accomplishment on its own. She hopes and thinks and fears in an understandable, human way. Her emotional reactions were very engaging, especially when it comes to her moments of doubt.

You'll probably get more out of it if you've passing familiarity with Christianity and the Bible since there are a lot of themes in common. (The use of dragon meat calls to mind manna.) The same goes for familiarity with the LDS church.

And before you think it's all about religion, the story turns into something of a mystery/suspense partway through. Or rather, it was one almost all along. That reminded me a bit of the normalcy in Gothic Romances turning darker as the story goes on.

My biggest issue is the epilogue, however. Without it, the story leaves the question of faith hanging in the air, entangled with doubt. It comes down to what you choose to believe. The epilogue, unfortunately, hammers home a definitive answer rather than leaving the ambiguity that any believer must wrestle with.

All in all, yeah, [[/u/WampuClawGirl][u/WampuClawGirl]], this was unusual and well-written enough to keep my interest. Thanks for sharing; I enjoyed it.

Without getting too much into spoilers, I will address this a bit. The epilogue is meant to be read in a sort of ironic way. The character writing it doesn't sense the irony in that throughout that whole ideal, /their/ faith hadn't been shaken at all. On one hand we have Rose, who is confused to the point of constant depression, and then we have the rest of her family, who doesn't understand why she just can't "have faith." The epilogue is more or less that particular character's looking back and doing just that. Because from his/her point of view, the flaw was with Rose's faith --- he/she cannot fathom that there would be any reason for a person to have doubts about the LDS church. And that's the irony at the end. So the epilogue wasn't meant to give the reader a definitive answer; the reader is more or less expected read it, and shake their head and go, "Oh my gosh, he/she does /not/ get it." Unfortunately this sort of thing is very common in the LDS church, and I would suppose most religious groups in general. I wrote this story out of a desire to express my own feelings of doubt and existential crisis. I grew up Mormon, but have recently lost my faith in the church. All of Rose's thoughts are ones I've had and still have. I basically wrote a story about myself.
