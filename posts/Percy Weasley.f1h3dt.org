So i didn't find a fic for a specific prompt, so I decided to write it instead, if you could check it out and tell me how to improve that'd mean a lot. Just starting with fanfic writing.

** Very intersting! I like how Audrey confronted the Weasleys for their behavior. There are a few typos, but nothing major. I liked your use of humor in subtle ways, such as the recurring use of “the Weasleys (plus Harry and Hermione)”- and how even when he was under appreciated by his family he still cared enough to name his daughter Molly.

If you're interested, your work reminds me a lot of linkffn(Muggle Me) in terms of having a psychological look at Percy.

Great job on your fic keep up the good work!

  Complete. AU. After the Percy/Arthur row---Percy wanders into muggle London where he is a victim of a memory charm during a Death Eater attack. Having no memories of his life in the wizarding world and lacking the most basic understanding of how the muggle world works, Percy struggles to adapt. Audrey, a muggle, takes interest... and an owl is following Percy around for some reason.
