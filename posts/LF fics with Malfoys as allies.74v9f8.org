So this request is prompted by reading the first chapter of The Price Of Loyalty by DZ2 (has been deleted). What i am looking for is a story with a grey or dark Harry supported by at least the Malfoys and snape. Don't really care about pairings or even if there are any.

  Nothing is going to plan. The Order is three days late to pick him up and Lucius Malfoy has somehow managed to get out of Azkaban. Remus always wants to talk, but Harry can't bring himself to even think of what happened in June. It was time to face facts: Harry's life belongs to the cause and his own feelings don't matter. Begins after Order of the Phoenix. Eventual Drarry.

  AU of PoA. Eventual HPDM slash. Harry wakes in the night to a voice calling him from somewhere in the castle. He follows it- and everything changes. Updated every Friday.
