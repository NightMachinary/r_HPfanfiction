Hello, kinda new to Harry Potter fanfiction. I was hoping you can recommend me some SI fics because I'm quite surprised that SI fics in this fandom is low. Hopefully more than 100k words. The longer the better. And even if not SI, it's ok if the MC's goal is to continually get stronger like noodlehammer's work, For love of Magic.(Can't link it)


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11745900][Rose Petal Red]] highly recommend, actually good writing. If nothing else read the side story, it's good. The SI suffers from normal SI stuff like extra powers no one has but they serve a purpose in the story and make it so the SI can't just speed run the books, leading to divergence.

*** I tried to read this. However I dropped ot very early since the MC is prevented from actually changing anything from the story because of "fate" punishing her. I was annoyed at that so I dropped it.

Also, about For Love of Magic... it's blocked because of how much technically illegal smut there is. Rule 8.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

** Not just as an SI fic, but this ranks as one of my all time favorite fanfics. Unfortunately, it's published in a forum (and not a fanfic site). Enjoy!

**** Just a heads up, you linked the FFN.net version of a different SI fic, What's Her Name in Hufflepuff. OP linked Umbrus Shade: The Incredibly Annoyed Ravenclaw.

There are a lot of good SIs on Sufficient Velocity, not just What's Her Name in Hufflepuff XD

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

Just because you don't know everything about the setting doesn't mean an outside perspective can't be entertaining. Distance from the events plus a dash of genre savvy can lead to interesting decisions.

*** Yeah, SI are kind of looked down on in most places, mostly because they are easily corrupted into Gary/Mary Stu/Sue stories. If done well, they can be engaging and a lot of fun, but it is soo hard to find any worth the digital space they take up.
