All the time authors write wizards as completely backwards and stupid people, sometimes communities in other countries are far more advanced because they use muggle technology. The question is though, are the muggles any more advanced at all.

Key points to show that wizards are backwards and behind muggles:

Slavery of house elves-We really don't know a lot about them other than they also work at Hogwarts and the Malfoys abused Dobby. Muggles enslaved and abused people up until a hundred years ago and these people were stolen from their homes and always abused.

Wizards are too reliant on magic and lazy-Magic is a part of them, it's like saying people are lazy and rely on their legs to walk instead of walking on their hands. Muggles are also incredibly reliant on electricity and would struggle to survive without it.

Muggle weapons are stronger-Are nuclear bombs really such an advanced device. The world could do a lot better without them.

Discrimination-Muggles don't discriminate between pureblood and muggleborn because the concept doesn't exist for them. Instead they discriminate between gender and race. Muggleborns being restricted in getting jibs is entirely fanon and even in the muggle world tge statement "It's not what you know but who you know" still holds true.

Muggle tech is more advanced-Not really, everything seems to have a magical counterpart if only it is slightly less convenient or sometimes better.

Magicals can't blend in with Muggles-Muggles can't blend in with Magicals either. Both are entirely different countries and neither have a need for the other so why would they need to know how.

Health and safety at Hogwarts-Magic can fix just about anything in a day so it is not so bad, magic is dangerous and that's why Hogwarts has a fully stocked hospital wing.

Hogwarts itself is outdated-The torches on the walls and ancient suits of armor are dangerous and impractical. That's the point isn't it, to look like a thousand year old castle.

The only downside of the magical world for Muggleborns in the sense of losing something is that they cannot contact parents with just a phone call because Muggles don't have a floo but the idea is that both worlds are seperate and owls are pretty effective at getting mail around.

There really isn't anything that makes muggles extremely superior to the magical world. You could argue that they are better because they did it all without magic but they use electricity which is a muggles magic and unavailable to wizards.


** I think the whole point is that they aren't better/worse, just different. Like, Magical world definitely has the best transportation tech (hello teleportation) but the muggle world has far better information technology. I'm not saying wikipedia is better than a massive dusty library, I'm just... oh wait, that's exactly what I'm saying. Trying to find something in a library when you're not sure what you're looking for is horrible compared to the convenience of a computer.

So like, magic wins in transport, medical, storage, etc etc, but muggle wins in information, communications, power generation (yeah thermonuclear power plants) and also pens. Quill pens need to die. Keyboards win every time.

Socially they're also about equal in that they both suck at not being racist, use slave labor (sweatshops vs houselves) but again that just supports my point. Both have things they're good at and bad at, but counted up they're just... societies made of people that use different methods towards the same ends.

So yeah. Different but equal. I think that the ideal society in the hp world would be one where everyone used both magic and science. I have this great idea for an app that helps build spells by doing the arithmetic calculations for you. Like, why choose when you can have both???

Imagine in the first book, Hermione just pulls out her MagicTab VI and looks up Flamel in like 10 seconds.

You forgot entertainment - wizards have no video games, no movies, no internet, no mp3 players, etc.

**** yesssss. Celestina Warbeck is not a good musical artist, and JKs fairytale writing ability sucks. Other than that they have apparently no culture whatsoever when it comes to that which is problematic bc that's an important part of a society.

****** I would like to say that the HP world is set in the early 90s (pre 1994) so the Web didn't exist then. There were video games, but they were not the things that we would call them. Also note that the room of requirement is a thing, literal holodeck over 1000 years old. The series also never goes into magic for information retrieval, which definitely will exist, but a first year student may not be able to use it. The information fetch quests after the first book were limited to things that would be restricted information in the muggle world. It could be that we just are not exposed to the calculation math because arithmancy is not ecposited on in the series.

*** It was the early 90s...the things you are mentioning muggles are better at didn't exist.

Why do you need a block of a cell phone when you can literally talk face to face with fire Skype or just pop over to their house for a few?

Why do you need electricity when you have magic powering your lights, water, heat, etc?

Id give you the internet now, but in the early 90s.... Everyone did their research by books.

** Muggles have reached the moon, whilst Magicians haven't. Wizards have mastered the art of enchanting things to completely change their entire purpose whilst muggles haven't. Australia has found a material to not only boost their technology and intelligence by at least x1000 times, but has increased their strength hundred-fold, making them an economic powerhouse and world power whilst the rest of the world, muggle or magical, hasn't. So to settle the argument, Australia wins.

*** what material would this be exactly. The moon landing was more of a flex than anything, it gained nothing other than the ability to say we landed on the moon. That isn't to say it isn't incredicly cool or an amazing accomplishment.

Also, everyone knows Australia will forever be a step down from New Zealand and you just can't change that.

****** [REDACTED] Actually, the dome got flooded when the scientist that convinced them to sink it made a rocket to go to space, but his son accidentally got into it, flew out, broke the dome, and killed all except his mother and father, of which his mother constantly started to make murder suicide threats to her husband, and when the he came back with 5 of his comrades plus Miss Pauling and another, his mother escaped to space, taking the last of the Australium, and breaking the dome a second time. The lost city of New Zealand was weird.

**** Uhhhh, no, the moon landing gave us many many things, the tech developed, and the ideas for future tech, did not leave the earth. We have computers, better communication, better travel, know much more on how to make necessary food stuffs grow in hostile environments, developed medical equipment, have a much better understanding of Earth, and our impact on it, and much much MUCH more from the tech developed starting with the space program.

I would argue we need another space race now to get the next bit bump in tech and understanding.
