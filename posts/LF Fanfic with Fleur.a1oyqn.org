Please no Harry/Fleur, if it's even possible. I'd like to read a fanfic without her being paired with anyone, just Fleur being awesome or her character being explored. I just want to see a Fleur appreciation/Veela exploration fic. Not sure if I'll be successful in my quest to find one but thanks in advance anyway.


** I'm afraid all I have are oneshots with background canon pairings:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/105485][Five Women Who Hate Fleur Delacour]] linkao3(105485) - this is my favorite Fleur fic, hands-down

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3395192][beautiful, lucky, charmed.]] linkao3(3395192) - about the Delacours in general, not just Fleur

** I can't remember the name, but there was a fic that was labelled as HP/FD but was abandoned before it could get to the pairing. In it, Fleur was a lazy, outrageously talented witch who did the most spontaneous things for fun in that fic.

*** I believe it has a scene where she forces harry off a great height just to force him to correctly apparate. Never really liked it. That version of Fleur seems pretty abusive.

It's one of those fics where you're not supposed to take everything seriously.

***** Well when something gets listed as with drama as one of the categories. I naturally assumed it was serious.

*** Yeah, I figured that's what I'd get a lot of. I'm not the biggest shipper or anything in any fandom, and in this case I get I might not get what I'm looking for. I just think there's a lot of potential to write about Fleur without focusing on romantic/sexual relationships.
