I just discovered that Mad Martha's author page on an Archive of Our Own is no longer available, and I can't find her fiction anywhere. I'm super sad because I LOVE her stories and re-read them every so often. Does anyone know if her works are online anywhere? In particular, her Two Households and Lodger series.
