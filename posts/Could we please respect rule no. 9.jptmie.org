While I don't see much verbal bashing of fic requests, there are a few requests that always get downvoted, like clockwork (usually requests for fics containing a certain character). Can we please not do that?

The reason we are in this sub is because we are looking for a safe place to request fics that we can lose ourselves in, that can be a little ray of light in an otherwise grey, depressing day or whatever.

Your downvote will not show us what despicable people we are for liking a certain character. They won't turn us away from reading fics about said character. They might turn us away from this sub, however. Which means less people who can recommend fics to /you./

Thanks for coming to my TED talk.


** I don't think the downvotes fall under Rule 9 per se, but I agree they add basically nothing.

All you're doing by downvoting a request thread is making it more unlikely that that thread gets replies - which in turn means other people looking for the same thing won't find anything in that thread either. That, in turn, just leads to /more/ requests of the same kind - so if anything, downvoting is counterproductive.

Unless a request actually violates Da Rules or a recommendation doesn't fit the request at all, don't downvote it.

I disagree. I've lurked on this sub for years and I've seen a marked decrease in requests/recommendations for slash involving Malfoys or Snape, and it correlates with mass downvoting of such posts.

I posit that a strong percentage of this sub does not want this kind of content (as encouragement or non-action leads to proliferation).

The system is working as intended.

**** In my experience it just comes and goes in waves. People give up for a while when their threads get nowhere, then it starts back up again when new people get interested in the same stuff and ask all over again.

All mass-downvoting is really doing is shoving the problem away for a little while, not solving it.

Just let the threads live to gather new fics, and if there get to be a lot of requests for the same stuff, just reply with other threads where the same thing is asked and answered. Same idea, better conveyance of "This is being asked too many times, we've answered it already".

** :: eats popcorn and watches the comments ::

This sub has very specific tastes and rules of what is and is not proper; like any collection of people, eventually culture develops of the correct way of doing things.

To each their own.

I respect this sub's opinion, and absolutely support people setting limits and things that they do not want to read or talk about, or characters that they find abhorrent, or types of stories or tropes that they find problematic.

A subreddit /is/ its users, and clearly (by the poll mentioned above) this subreddit has certain pairings that are discouraged often enough that most of the folk looking for that content have self selected out of interacting with the sub, which is how the system is supposed to work. The culture of this sub says this is not acceptable, and it gets downvoted (or not upvoted) and the person finds a different group that is a better fit. After a while, the people who stay are the ones who agree and the culture is reinforced.

Which usually means those requests come from people new to the culture of the sub itself.

The main issue I see with the downvoting and comments is that it alienates a potential new member, but, again, see above; those are the people the sub's culture has already decided that they would rather not see, so it's sort of... doing what it was designed to do.

There are other subreddits, discords, fic rec lists and such for requests that are more open to pairings.

Rule 9 should be changed to reflect the culture, because there will not be a time when an unacceptable'request will remain unchallenged in some way. It's the culture of this sub.

​

/:: rolls willpower. Fails her roll. ::/

​

However, I gotta say, I rarely see anybody discussing downvoting stories where people are being gorily murdered, or tortured, or emotionally manipulated until mindbreak, because we can all agree that this is fiction.

Just because you enjoy Stephen King, it doesn't mean you're secretly wishing you could disembowel someone with your creepy monster fingers you've been hiding in your clown suit. Nobody would ever say that the little old lady who binges heist stories is potentially a cat burglar, or that the guy reading sci-fi war stories would jump into a spaceship shoot aliens if you gave him the chance.

*It's fiction.* Murder isn't legal, but, we've all agreed that reading about fictional character being murdered does not make you culpable for a nutjob shooting someone in the face.

​

.... And anyway, this is all FANFICTION. We're all playing with JKR's Barbie dolls, making our little stories to tell each other. People are going to like things you don't, that's the way the world is.

There's HEAPS of things in fanfic I don't want to read, and you know what?

I just... Keep scrolling.

*** See, I dropped out of fandom for a decade or so, after being very involved for many years. When I left, Snarry was the most popular ship, and voldie/harry wasn't a thing I saw almost ever. (let alone romantic tommary). The vast majority of the fandom was female, and/or queer.

I still read fic, but stopped posting it, but I didn't interact much with fandom as a whole.

And then the nerd revolution happened, it's no longer a social death sentence to like fanfiction, and being a superfan is AOK with a huge group of people who would have never been caught dead liking fic flooded into all the fandoms.

Everything grew, changed.

I decide to get back into the social side of fic, and, being a redditor, I check here first.

I find this sub, and I'm like... wait, what? Tastes have changed soooo much! I visited the discord and it was like I was a boggart of slash past. Occasionally they @ me as part of their new user hazing ritual, threatening to make them read my fic.

At least it was memorable, eh?

I'm good natured, and it's only /fanfic/, so whatever. You like what you like. I never expected my slash to be popular anyway (because at the time I wrote it, fandom was so much smaller, so 'wide cic-het acceptance' was hardly my goal), so it didn't particularly bother me. (I find much weirder that they recognize my username, TBH).

I bop along, learning a lot about New Fandom, and reading new stuff, and accepted that the community I had found back in the slash hayday of Livejournal and inkstainedfingers and archiveAtTheEndofTheUniverse were gone, and that, while I was welcome to participate in fandom, I should expect to be judged for my fictional tastes.

Alright. It's only fanfiction. The very act of creating it is usually illegal, 'morally questionable' and all. I'm an older queer, I'm used to it.

And then I found other fandom discords, and realized that THIS IS NOT THE ONLY WAY.

In fact, the more I looked, the more this sub and the discord are a fandom anomaly. HUGE, of course! (it's reddit! it grows and grows), and, while their views are also out in wider fandom, they aren't the THIS IS THE WAY that it feels like by reading only this sub.

I found several amazing discords, and now only glance at this one. As I said above, the culture of this particular sub doesn't really want me, or people who like what I like around.

Fandom is as welcoming and bright and wholesome in its acceptance as it ever was... just not here.

**** I completely agree with everything you said. I got into fanfiction ~7 years ago when Tumblr was the biggest place for fanfiction and ships in general. I was exposed to every pairing you can name and while I didn't like all of them I accepted the fact that there are others who love them. People were still shamed for liking some pairings but it definitely wasn't like the culture of this sub and slash fics definitely weren't seen as terrible and "not proper."

At this point, I feel that the mods should add a slash fic ban if the response is going to be unhelpful and negative every time. They should make a poll asking if the users want slash fics and change the rules accordingly. We already have a separate subreddit for all the HP slash fics and it kinda sucks having two separate ones but it is what it is.

But I am curious about the makeup of this sub just to see why the culture is what it is.

**** Link to those discords? Or are they non-hp-related?

For the record, the hpff Discord I lurk (I think it's the "main" one) isn't nearly as hostile to other people's preferences as this subreddit is. Usually whenever I mention my preferences here, I'm downvoted most of the time, or at least land in the inbetween with a "controversial" flag (but it used to be even worse, at one point I was downvoted for it 100% of the time). On the Discord, the response is far more neutral -- I get the occasional "it's an ok ship, I've read a fic or two" and the worst people give is "eh I don't like that ship, but you do you" or similar. Granted, my OTP isn't quite as out there as some others, but it's very much a minority ship, and a somewhat controversial one. The ship in question is Snily, for reference.

However, I've seen some HP fanfic Discords with a focus on a particular ship be /very/ hostile to other options, to the point of kicks/bans. But this is very rare.

In short, downvotes are for posts and comments which don't contribute anything meaningful to a subreddit or discussion, and as such there isn't any reason for /anyone/ to see them.

Downvoting something you disagree with makes it less likely for other people (who might be interested) to see it, which is a dick move because why should your opinion take away their opportunity to see those things?

It is indeed informal and non enforceable, but we should all strive to abide by them for a better reddit experience for everyone, as outlined in my other comment(s).

Thanks for your criticism (unlike the other person who was just obtuse about it), it certainly contributed to my understanding of the situation so have an upvote.

I mentioned this elsewhere with Voldemort/Harry and SSHG/SSHP: just because you /can/ make a fic like you describe, doesn't mean that's what people look for when they ask for that ship. Some examples that are contrary to this view (note that these are random plot examples and not specific fics I've read, personally I avoid all Tomarry for instance).

Tomarry: Diary!Tom gets a body, redeems himself somehow. 5 years later, he ends up developing a relationship with Harry.

Snarry: Postwar after a couple of years where everything has died down, Harry reaches out to an alive Snape asking what's up. Things go from there.

Snamione: Hermione somehow trips back to the Marauder-era by time turner shenanigans and stumbles upon and eventually romances a young Snape (this is a remarkably common SSHG plot).

Severus Snape spends more time with Hermione than her parents do from the age of 11-18. This isn't a situation where someone meets their 4th grade teach 15 years later and hits it off. He was a constant authority presence in her pubescent and adolescent years (and Harry's, and every other student). Unless it is completely AU, where Snape never interacted with the characters until they were able to make adult decisions, it is grooming or the Stockholm syndrome version of it.

I sincerely hope that it is teens requesting writing these fics, because it is just so grim to think of adults making justifications and excuses for this type of fantasy.

*********** I'm not sure if I agree, but at the same time, it's not exactly a situation I've been in myself, so it's hard to say.

But my personal view on that kind of fic was always that, at that point (this is typically set around 1996->1976), Snape is a very different person than what he is as a teacher. This combined with the fact that she doesn't really /know/ him as an adult besides as a position of a teacher, and that she'd be forced to interact with him more as a student the same year as him, ultimately makes the situation far more sensible than a teacher/student thing.

Sure, he might still be a crappy person -- he did become a Death Eater after all in canon. But I never saw /this/ in particular as a problem.

EDIT: Figured I'd add another thing wrt the Snarry example: I haven't had the teachers I had as a kid for over a decade, despite having some of them for almost 10 years. While none of the teachers I had was particularly young (so unlikely to ever get my interest in that sense even if I did meet them today), even if that was the case, I wouldn't really see any harm in it personally at this point.

Are you saying it's different because Hermione and Snape lives in the same building? That's... not really a valid argument to me, because while it's technically true, there is a very clear seperation of dormitories and teachers' quarters (or whatever place the teachers use for sleep).

I taught at a university level - my students were all adults - and I can tell you there are clear power dynamics at play. Change that to teaching children, the /same/ children for 7 years straight who are isolated from their parents, and those power dynamics become complete domination.

I've said above, this is extremely disturbing for any adult to fantasize about. Kids are immature, so they don't understand how twisted it is for an adult to manipulate a child like that, but every adult should know how... /gross/ it is to imagine an adult see a child grow up and then as soon as they're legal try to get in their pants.

Yeah, that's not happening. This sub doesn't have a vague, ethereal number of users; there are ~57k subscribers and the majority have specific tastes. The sub IS its users, it's not a utopian bastion of expression.

If you check out the 2019 [[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSek--_OJ_WjhGMeITBd685CJxsE9QEG3tROWWa7FVCVPcK5AQ/viewanalytics][survey]] you'll see that although 50% of users admit to reading slash, in the favorite slash pairing for Harry graph, SS receives 4% while TM/Voldemort receives 12%. That means only a very small minority of the sub (2%/6% respectively if you count half the users not reading slash at all) approves of these pairings, therefore they are downvoted to oblivion.

But I don't downvote request threads for those -- in fact, sometimes I upvote them, specifically to counter the rampant downvoting of things people don't like. Because all downvotes do is drive people away, splitting the HP fanfiction community into a bunch of smaller ones each with their own preferences. Why do you think [[/r/hpslashfic][r/hpslashfic]] exists in first place, for instance? It's likely a result of this very thing, at least in part. I've seen people recommend the sub to those with preferences that induce downvotes (and whose preferences are slash in nature).

It's true that I'm sometimes downvoted for my own preferences, but I don't care about that nearly as much as for request threads, since those ultimately only affect myself, while request threads usually apply to a group of people.

There's plenty of postwar fics, or Marauder-era fics, with the characters, that are harmless in that sense. While I personally stay away from most Snamione and essentially all Snarry with little to no exception, it has more to do with the typical fics severely violating my preferences rather than the ships themselves.

A similar argument can be made for Voldemort/Harry, even if I've never read any of those myself: consider the concept of a Tomarry fic where Tom is the teenager from the Diary. Still somewhat suspect age-wise, but only in the beginning. 5 years later, and there wouldn't be anything significantly wrong with the ship from the point of age.
