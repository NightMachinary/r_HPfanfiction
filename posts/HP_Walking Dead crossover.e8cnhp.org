I read this a while ago and can no longer find it. I was wondering if anyone else knew the fic and if it can still be found. Harry and Teddy are with the Atlanta survivors at the Quarry Camp. Harry is a werewolf, and immune to the walker infection due to the lycanthropy. When the camp is attacked, Harry bites Amy to save her life. Does this sound familiar to anyone?


** This was a slash story with Daryl if that helps....
