I thought judging from all the attention it had gotten and the awesome show it turned out to be that it would have a healthy crossover community. One where everyone had gone rabid trying to continue the experience in between seasons and with their own twists, but what I found was more than a little anemic. Ffn, ao3, I even tried rrl(But never wattpad...)\\
and none of those sites had anything above a 10k story that wasn't a giant amalgamation of a dozen other fandoms(ao3) while the rest were a handful of one shots and incomplete one or two chapter stories, which isn't any better.

​

So I'm curious, does the average Harry Potter fan not like Stranger Things? I thought for sure after watching s2 e1(My current progress, so don't spoil) that someone would've replaced (Spoiler Alert) Hop living with Eleven at the cabin with Harry moving into town and adopting her instead as it just fits with what I know of other crossovers. I thought I'd maybe find something where he becomes a teacher in their school, one where he moves in to start his own shop, stumbles into town while traveling through the States, time travel and etc! I'm not a writer and these idea's are all coming naturally to me, so what's up?

​

​

If someone has something of their own please self promote, I won't judge. And damn what a way to reveal El in season 2, I almost can't wait to jump back in to find out how that happened. But thinking back on how the first season ended I should've known something was up when Hop was walking around with a big smile :/


** Maybe it is not the problem of 'liking' but the fact that there is not enough interest to write crossovers.

After all, it is the writer's burden to create the story and that might be a hard barrier of entry.

*** But generally where the fans go crossovers aren't too far behind. It's been like that for fanfics with a much higher barrier of entry, GOT crossovers for example can't be easy and I have no problems finding them with 100k plus words.

**** Got had its first book published in 1996. It's been around for quite some time and GRRM wasn't exactly unknown before. And the recent hype surrounding the TV series is a lot bigger than stranger things

** It takes place in a different time period, in a different location, with no particular linking features (i.e. wizards). Most people reading fanfiction are looking for stuff that builds on or plays with canon in some way, with characters or locations that they're already comfortable with, and Stranger Things as a setting doesn't really offer anything that gives some unique synergy for the setting. Writing fanfiction is already fairly niche, and the "glory days" of HP fanfiction are arguably long in the past, you aren't seeing a huge upsurge in fics. Crossovers are another niche within that niche. Stranger Things was popular, but it doesn't have nearly the popularity of ASOIAF, and even ASOIAF doesn't exactly have a huge catalogue of HP crossover fanfics. Many writers would much rather write original fiction, especially since you can't really monetize the work you put into fanfiction. 'Harry adopts X character' is a fairly lazy trope.

I don't see how you looked at 'there aren't any Stranger Thing x Harry Potter crossovers' and decided that it meant anything at all about overlap between the communities. And a handful of crossovers do actually exist, oneshots for a plot idea are generally much easier to put together than trying to establish a multichapter fic.

*** My reasons for looking at it this way was and still is for the reasons I mentioned above. The show is really fcken popular. I as a non writer am full of different ideas, so coming up with something workable shouldn't be hard for the wider fan base. Tropes are known as that for a reason, everyone does them and that's why it's what I expect to find. Crossovers have been done for far less popular shows and you won't struggle to find something to spend a couple hours on in the GOT crossover library for example in spite of it not having a hundred thousand to look through. Amongst the ones you can find you will see 100-300k word behemoths of a fanfic.

​

No, scratch that. Wtf am I doing using GOT as an example of a less popular show lol? Still, shows with far less...

​

I've been reading on ffn for years so I'm more than familiar with what to expect from the current generation of writers, and that's why when I say "it should be popular" I'm being relative to what I know of my niche. This seems so crazy to me, all my experience is telling me this should be a fairly popular crossover to do but it's just not. How do you explain it?

******* Or you could bum off a friends account, I've seen it happen a couple dozen times and it seems fairly normal to do. Ask and if they're fine with sharing make a profile for yourself on their account. That way you aren't messing up their recommended movies and shows while watching your stuff.

**** I have crossover ideas all the time, but premise does not make a great story.

You'll likely never hear about a crappy author doing a StTh crossover, and a great author probably can't get past the amount of work required to force the two worlds together.

I've got over half a million words of fanfic to my name, and I love Stranger Things. But I just don't see an engaging reason to put them together.

Also... the better the show/book/movie/comic, the less plotholes it has, the less inspired someone is to fill in the blanks and the less need for fanfiction.

I love Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and I love Lord of the Rings, but reading a story where Xander gets sucked into a portal and ends up helping fight in the first War of the Ring... not my bag. It doesn't really answer any questions about either world that I feel need answering.

***** Fair enough. My assumption when making this post was more along the lines of taking the characters and making a new story with them, but that's a valid point and it's hard to imagine a scenario where Harry isn't a third wheel to the canon plot.

What's your account name and what site are you on? I'm curious if I've seen any of your fanfics before, I've read a lot.

***** Though, you've got to admit one thing at least. It would be funny to see something where the boys accidentally summon a wizard while playing D&D, right? Some parody where they press him to use Fireball and Harry has to admit he never learned how to. It would be hilarious.

****** Summon a real live wizard... he's 6, says his name is Freak, and lives in a cupboard under the stairs.

Like Eleven, they hide him from their parents and try to take care of him themselves.

...and then the problem... how does that affect the Harry Potter storyline? Does it help Harry somehow other than a better place to live? Does little Harry get involved in fighting the upside down monsters? Do American Wizards get involved with the Nomaj problem in Indiana?

beginning a fic this early in harry's life is a huge undertaking...I prefer to start in at least 4th year so I don't have to rewrite his entire life story... but if anyone likes the idea, feel free to run with it.

** I don't think it's because fans of HP naturally dislike Stranger Things, but rather because there are a few logistical problems to making a crossover work. Case in point: without serious tweaking to either timeline (which would either muddle the HP timeline further, or rob ST of its clearly intentional 80's nostalgia) or time travel (which would cause us to ask what the hell Harry's doing in 1980s /Indiana/, of all places), Harry could never adopt Eleven nor could he become a teacher at their school because he would be around four or five years old at the time. Like, I guess you could write a crossover where Eleven's powers are the result of the American government trying to artificially create a wizard and only getting halfway there, but actually tying that plot to HP canon would be tedious, to say the least.

** Love Stranger Things. Love Harry Potter.

Hate crossovers.

Also Stranger Things and Harry Potter don't have any logical connection imo - but this is how I feel about 99% of crossover works. The connection between the two worlds has to be explained most of the time with dimension travel or whatever other nonsense the author comes up with.

That in mind, I think the kids of Stranger Things bear remarkably little resemblance to the trio. They solve their problems very differently, have different dynamics, and actually /tell the adults what's going on./

*** It's a tv show and I don't think many people doubt it's popularity. Not sure how to really find the appropriate numbers to prove it's income and number of viewers, but I found something talking about it being, at the time, the most popular show both on Netflix and any other provider regardless. Even shows like the walking dead get ranked lower.

​

You should definitely watch the show, it's amazing!
