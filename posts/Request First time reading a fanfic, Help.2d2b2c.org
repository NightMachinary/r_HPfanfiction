So the only fanfics i've read so far are the james potter series. I finsished the 4.5 books or whatever the 2.5 counts as and I'm looking for something similar to them. or one about harry and ginny.


** See the collected works (76 so far) of [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]]. The author only does canon-compatible stories, and they are well worth a look. As it says in his profile, "I appear to be writing several stories. In fact, I'm only writing one."

** I'd second [[/u/wordhammer]] 's suggestion of Northumbrian's stories, a great series of canon-compliant tales set after the events of the HP series. Northumbrian has impeccable writing chops.

Another very good post-canon story is Inverarity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Houses Divided]] by Inverarity; 205k words, complete.

#+begin_quote
  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

The same author wrote a series of novels (the Alexandra Quick series) set in an American magical school after the Harry Potter series and are HP canon compliant (though few events from the HP series factor into the plot). Inverarity also has pro-caliber writing chops and (in my opinion) anything he writes is worth checking out.

I'd also recommend the Mercurial Trio series of one-shots by respitechristopher, beginning with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4180032/1/Albus-Potter-and-the-Misspent-Youth][Albus Potter and the Misspent Youth]], 9k words, complete.

  For the Reviews Lounge "Birthdays" challenge. What does one do when Dad's birthday is just another reason to dodge Paparazzi on the way into a Ministry ball? Get your cousin and best mate to orchestrate an absolutely fabulous entrance, apparently.
#+end_quote

This series is written as an authorized sequel to Lady Altair's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize][Cauterize]], arguably the best one-shot in the fandom and definitely worth a read.

For Harry/Ginny stories, I suggest going to [[http://www.siye.co.uk][SIYE]] or [[http://www.phoenixsong.net][PhoenixSong]], two sites that specialize in stories with at least an implicit H/G pairing.

** The Albus saga [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1619871/Vekin87]]

I don't recommend getting stuck in slice of life or shipping stories if you can avoid it.
