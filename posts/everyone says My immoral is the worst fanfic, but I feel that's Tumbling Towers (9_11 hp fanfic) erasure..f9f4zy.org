****** I'd argue it was more alluding than implying. It's also worth remembering that, at the time, precious little was known about Grindelwald, specifically his stance on the issue of blood purity. Even now I'd argue we don't really know anything substantial about him, even with the two Fantastic Beasts movies having him involved to greater or lesser amounts (because it's entirely plausible that anything and everything he told other characters could've been lies to manipulate them).

******* Is it an excuse, though? I mean, it would be if someone was trying to explain it away in reality, but since it's fanfiction about a whole wizarding world, it's already not very realistic. Imo, it just seems like an attempt to integrate the events of magical & muggle history in a fairly 'reasonable' way (similar to historical witch burnings targeting actual weak witches/wizards, even though in reality, it was mostly just a horrible exercise in scapegoating and tossing blame, and /tens of thousands/ of people were likely burned to death during it).

********* bro that comment was 2 months old lmao

Anyways, if you want to take that interpretation, it's your prerogative, but it's an attempt to force magic into a historical tragedy. Some things get lost in translation, or need to be lost because the Nazis don't go full w40k with wizards on their side.

Similar to the witch burnings if you think about it in terms of lacking sensitivity/realism, because it reduces the issues of social stigma/church and gov't finding people to blame/scapegoating/etc leading to a tragedy and many deaths with "no, there were actually legit witches they were hunting down, they were right".

Also, even if it does lessen the severity of portrayed historical tragedies/if you interpret it as implying that they "wouldn't be so bad without wizards", the key point is /wizards/. It's set in a literal fantasy world that clearly isn't adjacent enough to reality for such a thing to be legitimate social commentary, so taking offense at it is asinine.

**** But people write stories where a real tragedy was an important element all the time.

The movie "Titanic" tells a love story using a big disaster as the tragic element to make people cry for the lovers. There is a Doctor Who episode where at the end the Doctor has to cause the vulcano outbreak that that leads to Pompei being buried. And so on.

I think the problem with a storry using 9/11 the way you describe is how recent it happened and how strong the impact is still felt more than that a tragedy was used in it.

****** They said "using a tragedy for fan fiction" is what makes it bad.

Plus, in the second story I pointed out it may not been "magic made me do it" but instead of "natural events" you have " The Doctor did this horrible thing because it needed to be done" which is not much different, apart from nobody alive today having been alive back then, so the Tragedy has become something we gladly will spin stories about.

****** How is it particularly awful compared to other works of fiction that use tragedies? It's the Death Eaters doing it, so it's hardly portrayed as something /good/ (quite the opposite, really), and nobody is saying that "magic made them do it" in /real life/.

#+begin_quote
  excusing actual historical events...is pretty dang awful
#+end_quote

But it doesn't really do this. It clearly involves an imaginary magical world that doesn't exist, so the fic is hardly making excuses for the actual event like you say it is. Fiction isn't reality.

**** There's nothing wrong with using a real tragedy for any form of writing. It becomes controversial when you make fun of a tragedy maliciously. For example, mocking 9/11 survivors or their families.

Alluding to the Death Eaters influencing or committing 9/11 is not particularly heinous, though it is perhaps a tad tasteless to some people. I personally don't have an issue with it though.
