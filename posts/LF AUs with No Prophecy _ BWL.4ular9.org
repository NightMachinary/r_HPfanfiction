Basically, anything that showcases what could have happened if there was no prophecy and/or no BWL to interrupt the First Wizarding War. Preferably gen. Any POV. And I've already read Prince of the Dark Kingdom, which I bet is what will come to mind first for most people.

Thanks!


** Well, a while ago, I asked for stories in which Harry got killed successfully as a baby, with no BWL. linkffn(7781192) linkao3(4308630)

  What if Voldemort went after Harry and Neville, and gave no one a chance to die for them? What if both Chosen Ones died as children?--There was no prophesied boy, but there was still this--dozens of shadowed young faces refusing to run, even at the very end of the world. Dumbledore looked out at his chess pieces, pawns and queens; his children and his friends; his collateral damage. He had the beginnings of a plan swelling in his chest. It would take them decades to get their hands, quietly, on every Horcrux. Tom Riddle had to think they were secret. He had to think he was safe. It would take them almost decades, but one day he would be mortal again. These dozens of faces--they were mortal now. Alastor Moody could feel mortality in the aches of old broken bones; Andromeda rewrote her own last name. Remus and Sirius felt empty, gaping holes in the seats around them, and they made crude, expansive, joyous toasts to friends' memories. When Molly first reached over and held Arthur's hand, they knew this was something that could not last. That was why they held hands, held on, held tight.

  Suppose Tom Riddle never bothers to show mercy, and Harry Potter dies with his parents? What would that mean for the world, to have no Boy-Who-Lived to save them? ("A couple of stubborn kids" just doesn't have the same ring to it.)

*** Holy crap, can I just say that Harry Potter without Harry Potter is so completely excellent! I'm only halfway through and the character growth and plot variations of so many different characters is so well done. I'm really loving this story. Thanks for the rec!

** This one has no BWL, and so far no prophecy either. Riddle decides to go the politics route instead of becoming Voldemort so the first war never happened.

** So you want fics where the world is kind of shit because the bad guy won? My favorite! Check out linkffn(reign of the serpent) and linkffn(champion by octaviusowl). Both are ongoing with super infrequent updates but they're totally worth the read.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.
