Lemme explain what "checkpoint" is. Basically, the idea is that every time the user dies, they wake up earlier that day when they last woke up, so every time they sleep their setting a checkpoint. I thought it would be an interesting power.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12388283/1/The-many-Deaths-of-Harry-Potter][The many Deaths of Harry Potter]] by ShayneT is for the most part what you are asking for. Harry has no control where checkpoints are and they can be seemingly random.

The story updates daily, but the author is on vacation for a week, I'm also pretty sure that it was about to do a jump back a few weeks or we'd be reading the epilogue, probably the latter.

** Maybe "Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon"? linkffn(6517567)

Hermione creates a set of runes that act as a temporal anchor in the Chamber of Secrets. Another set of runes sends Hermione and Harry's memories back to their younger selves at the time the runes were set when they die.

The author stated that this would be left incomplete so they could add to it as ideas came to them... I haven't finish reading it myself.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

  Harry Potter catches Voldemort's AK to the noggin only to find out that his life is a video game and he forgot to save. So what does he do? Does he return on Hard mode and work for the challenge? Heck No! Harry uses every exploit, grind, or underhanded tactic he can get his hands on. His life may be a video game, but nobody plays Harry Potter; Harry's going to exploit the system.

** I'd like to see a Harry with a load/save system. He can set a save point at any time, can have multiple ones(limited slots? unlimited?), and can return(loading the save) to them with a thought.

He could load a save as many times as he wanted, allowing him to save scum his way through life, but should he skip back a few saves and load that one, all the ones that came after it are cleared and lost.

For example, let's say he makes saves at the end of Year 2, Hogwarts Express in Year 3, prior to the boggart Year 3, and prior to learning the Patronus. Harry loads the Patronus save half a dozen times, extorting a number of spells from Remus, then decides to load the Express save. The boggart and Patronus saves are lost, cleared away due to loading a save prior to them.

It wouldn't be a really serious story, I don't think, it'd allow for a great deal of crack and what if ideas to be written.
