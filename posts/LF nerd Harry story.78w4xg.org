Looking for a story, where Harry is a gaming/tabletop/anime nerd and tries and succeeds to recreate spells and magics from the fiction in the real world.

Something like earlier chapters of "For Love of Magic", but without being an ass and turning into porn.


** linkffn(weeb)

Tries and mostly fails... not always though.

  Harry grows up watching anime and fantasizing about having superpowers. When his Hogwarts letter arrives, he jumps at the chance to live the life of a harem protagonist. Not a harem fic. Timeline moved forward to modern day.

  Harry takes inspiration from a manga called Fairy Tail, as well as the great creation we call "The Internet". What follows is a different path taken. A path of strife, rebellion, and above all, power. Welcome to the New Age. Timeline moved to the 2010s. Eventual X-over with Devil May Cry 3, Stargate: SG-1, Smallville, Dresden Files and Ranma.

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun.
