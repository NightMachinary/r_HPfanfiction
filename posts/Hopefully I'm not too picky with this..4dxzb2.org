** This one is a great oneshot from the perspective of Rufus Scrimgeour - linkffn(11357101)

Not sure what your feelings are on next generation fics, but this is the best one I've read and it follows Teddy Lupin through Hogwarts. There is a sequel in progress. Linkffn(10554013)

** I'm generally disappointed by the lack of high quality postwar fics, but there are still some I like:

*Grave Days*, linkffn(5486257), shows what happened immediately after the Battle of Hogwarts.

*Strangers at Drakeshaugh*, linkffn(6331126), is about Harry's family life amid a murder mystery.

*Children's Crusade*, linkffn(6989327), has a Hermione from another dimension summon the trio and Ginny to defeat Voldemort one more time. Epilogue compliant.

*We are the Golden Trio!*, linkffn(7405516), is a time travel story where the trio went into a different time line, fixed things up, and still went back to their original one. I think it should be canon compliant.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3955920/HalfASlug][Halfaslug]] has a lot of small one shots (that is too say, small stories of only one chapter) set after the books. Most of them are really cool, there's not much addventure like you requested, since they're mostly Ron Hermione and Harry hanging out. I'd suggest yout ake a look at it anyway!

(PS [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/4bvt2f/fanfiction_friday/d1dc2cu][This]] is my current list of recomended fanfics. Although not all of them fit your request, I'd recomend a look at it anyway, since we seem to have a lot of the same tastes!)

** Someone else has already suggested a couple by Northumbrian (Grave Days is very good! Strangers at Drakeshaugh is mostly an everyday slice of parent life, with a hint of background adventure). Here's the link to his page so you can take a look at the timeline in the bio if you want to read them in order: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian]]

This one involves finding the remaining Death Eaters: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6342013/1/Hunters-and-Prey]] (fair warning, it jumps around chronologically chapter to chapter, and can be a bit confusing, but everything ties together nicely).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9992917/1/Friends-and-Foes]] is incomplete but is adventure (and romance apparently? I don't remember that part) - searching for Colin's murderer.

Some of his MIT (Muggle Interface Team) stories are really good too, but those focus more on minor characters or OCs than Harry. If you're open to reading about stuff occurring during DH, he's written 'Fred and George's Busy Day' and 'Tales of the Battle' which I'd recommend as well (Tales involves multiple perspectives).

** If you think you might enjoy it, there's linkffn(Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness) which is DH seen from Neville's point of view. Moreover, if you want to see Harry interacting with his children, the best you can go for IMO is linkffn(Grow Young with Me), be advised though that it isn't Epilogue-compliant, but the depiction of the characters is so good that I think it would be the best you could go for if you're beginning in fanfictions.
