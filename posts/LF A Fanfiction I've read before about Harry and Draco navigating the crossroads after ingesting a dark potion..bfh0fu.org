I've looked up as many keywords as I can remember and I just can't find it. I don't remember if it was on FFN or AO3 but here's pretty much what I remember. I really would like to read it again so if anyone knows of it please, please let me know!

Okay, so basically Harry was taking some dark, forbidden potion for dumbledore and snape. But the potion had the side effect of sending Harry to a dream dimension where he'd walk along the Crossroads and meet otherworldly beings, such as the old gods. But at some point, something goes wrong? And Draco also takes the potion and becomes the "Caller" or something and they can learn to enter this otherworldly realm on their own?

Thank you for taking the time to read this and potentially helping me find this fanfic. <3
