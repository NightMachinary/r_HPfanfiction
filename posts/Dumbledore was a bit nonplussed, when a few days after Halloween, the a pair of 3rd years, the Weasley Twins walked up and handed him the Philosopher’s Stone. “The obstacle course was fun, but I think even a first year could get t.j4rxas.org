**** There's also the fact that to get the stone out of the mirror, your biggest desire had to be to "find the stone and not use it", which suggests you had to at least be aware there was a philosophers' stone hidden in the mirror in first place. The only students who had cause to find out the specifics of what exactly was hidden behind all those traps were Harry and his friends because he was aware of the package Hagrid removed from Gringotts prior the break-in to the bank and had an inkling of where to start their investigation.

****** Would they even know something is hidden there when they just expected it to be an obstacle course, though? And even if they did suspect, would it trump their desire for their own joke shop for long enough to show them the hidden gem?

As Dumbledore told Harry, the mirror shows the most desperate wish the person looking into it carries in their heart. The reason Harry got the stone was that he was desperately wishing to know where the stone was TO KEEP IT FROM VOLDEMORT'S CLUTCHES. The only reason this trumped his yearning for family was that at the moment, he believed the stone to be in imminent danger.

Would the twins really be able to get the stone without this kind of urgency?

Their *life dream* of having their own joke shop just would not be overshadowed by their curiosity of what is hidden. And the mirror shows you your *most desperate desire*, not the lukewarm curiosity you happen to have for the puzzle of what your teachers are hiding. They would probably see themselves opening their shop at Diagon Alley when they reach the end, not themselves finding the stone.

**** I think the bait was to lure voldie to look at the mirror to maybe trap him in its enchantments and the reason it was not placed in the room was because Dumbledore had to tweak its enchantments to trap his spirit once he touched the mirror or something. Considering how vague the reasons for his actions were given in the books, it is likely that the stone itself was a fake. Maybe there could have been a safe to place the stone in or even some obscure charms or enchantments to trap him on the stone itself, it is likely dumbledore wanted to ensure whichever magic tom used to make was neutralised, so he trapped him to buy himself some time to destroy the spirit.

I recently found a oneshot in which dumbledore visited him on his 8th bday and from then onwards visited him often to ensure he had a good childhood, where the spirit trapping happened.

****** True. This is all conjecture. The books are really vague on this. Maybe it was because voldemort wasn't directly looking into the mirror and kept quirrel from falling into a trance since voldemort was a parasite and didn't force a full possession. Or maybe dumbledore only meant to delay voldemort till he could arrive. Besides Voldemort was very arrogant and self assured and possibly insane. I mean look how he kept "trophies" as proof of how he was better than others and even admitted in front of all the death eaters in the graveyard that he was the son of a muggle.

So vodemort only partially possesses quirrel as he could possibly sever himself from him at any time and escape if there was a trap. Considering that he was already immortal, he probably needed the philosophers stone to create a new body and was confident that Dumbledore did not know of his horcruxes. This is my head cannon.

****** Voldemort is also at this point pretty damn unstable. I can see it as possible that he could be trapped in such a situation. He's powerful, smart, cunning, and insane, but he is not infallible. Considering how desperate he is at this point in his life(unlife? Death? HTH do you describe him here), he could definitely miss a trap from Dumbledore with the power of the Elder wand that he won through a fight(which is supposedly impossible), so yeah. That's my thoughts.

*** linkao3(23277868) is a guilty pleasure fic, but I do love the actual protection for the stone. Dumbledore draws all the attention to the obstacle course and the fake, while Snape tells the handful of potions students who care that he made a mistake in brewing room 5 over the summer and he's locked it down to keep students away. Then the actual room is rigged with lethal curses.

  Harry Potter was born in 1977, three years before his brother Charlus. It was his brother who vanquished Voldemort on Halloween, 1981, while he is taken by Sirius Black - and accidentally locked in Azkaban. Contains mild James and Lily bashing, but they aren't evil. Not evil Harry Potter.

** My favorite theory re the Stone is that the obstacle course was never meant to stop anyone, or at least not anyone capable. It was meant to make the stone /appear/ protected, while the only real defense was the mirror. Snape's fire trap, however, would prevent someone leaving once they entered. The goal was to trap Tom, and either arrange a confrontation between him and Harry under semi-controlled conditions, or enable Dumbledore to imprison him (remember, Dumbledore is implied to have not known about the horcruxes until Chamber of Secrets, so this was likely an attempt to end Tom for good- Dumbledore was no doubt terrible disappointed when it failed).
