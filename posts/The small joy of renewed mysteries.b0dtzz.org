In fanfics that include 4th year, I always find myself drawn into trying figure out whether Moody is an imposter or not. It's one of the big twists in the books, and I love that in fanfics it might turn out that Moody might actually be Moody.

Are there other twists or mysteries in canon that you look forward to reading new versions of in fanfics?


** In the really well written series I'm always in total suspense over how/if Sirius is going to die. The way Harry went to the Department of Mysteries in canon hinges on such a small (/cough/stupid/cough/) detail that most fanfics end up in a position where that plot point is unrealistic. Seeing how authors tackle such a major event is always oddly thrilling for me despite my overall apathy towards Sirius.

*** Ooo yeah that's another good one! That's a place where it's interesting to see the different ways that piece of the plot can be fixed.

** I love seeing what others will do to solve the more luck-based solutions that occur in the series, and am usually disappointed when the author chooses to re-engineer the same solutions with a bit more backtalk (I'm guilty of this as well, I know).

- How to get Hermione away from troll
- Defeating the basilisk/rescuing Ginny or her stand-in
- Most of the fourth book, especially the Tasks and Riddle's return - bonus points if they don't use the portkey to get to safety yet still demonstrate that Voldemort is far beyond Harry's abilities to defeat
- Fifth book is great for making better choices, so long as it isn't a curbstomp on Umbridge; she really is a great villain who shouldn't be wasted
- everything about book 6; so much is wrong with the plot and execution that ought to be rewoven

If by that point book seven still resembles the original, the writer has simply stopped trying.
