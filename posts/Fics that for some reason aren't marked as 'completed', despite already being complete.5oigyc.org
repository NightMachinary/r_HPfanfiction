I wonder if any completed stories are out there which I'll never find, just because the author forgot to set the 'completed' flag. Since I avoid fics marked as 'in progress', I might be missing some stories. Any ideas?


** I'm not sure on this, but I also think that the ability to say "complete" was added after ffnet's creation. so some of those fics might also be quite old.

** I forgot to do this for a one shot once and even though I changed it every know and then I still get people asking me when it will update.

I'm not sure there's a clear way of doing it; checking reviews is an option but you may get spoiled. Perhaps check the authors page - if they have lots of abandoned stories alarm bells should ring.

*** Meh, some people just take longer to update. I'm still actively writing, have a half dozen incomplete fics which haven't been updated in ages but still are being written! The problem with being an adult is that life makes it hard to find time to write.

**** Oh definitely! I'm being slow myself at this point. But of there are lots of stories, none of which are finished, you could probably put money on the recently updated one not being finished too.

** linkffn(Looking for Magic) is basically complete. The author intended an epilogue and maybe 1 more chapter wrap up, but it is a full, satisfying story as is.

  Severus Snape and Hermione Granger deal with traumas past and present and find they have more in common than they realize as they prepare for the ultimate confrontation with Voldemort. SSHG pairing. Not HBP compliant. This is a novel length story.

** Read the A/N of the last chapter, also read the reviews, the most recent will usually be about the last chapter, and people will often be thanking the author and such for the "amazing journey".

Also, it will also tell you if the author has not updated in months and is on hiatus/abandonned.

It doesn't always work though. I'm pretty sure fics like Dodging Prison, which are split into more than one 'Books' get reviews like that at the end of every 'Book' the writer finishes.

Good advice. Another very nifty little trick is how you can find out the update schedule of a writer by checking the date on the first review of every chapter.

**** Yes, but then you can go check the second 'book' and see how he is and if he still updates regularly, at the very least.
