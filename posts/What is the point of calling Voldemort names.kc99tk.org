I mean seriously why do so many authors have to "belittle" him by having Harry and sometimes others call him by names such as "Tommy Boy" and "Moldyshorts"? What is the Point?

In my opinion the only thing you achieve by that is make a supposedly jaded Harry seem childish. It also always seems to miss the point...

I just ready the first chapter of linkffn(Do Not Meddle In The Affairs Of Wizards by Corwalch) and i just don't get the point... on one side the author tries to make Harry appear like he has grown weary and apathetic towards the Wizarding World as well as have him he incredible powerful yet on the other side he has him react pretty childish by calling Voldemort "Tommy Boy" to his face and "Moldyshorts" while talking about him to his Death Eaters.

If he wants to belittle Voldemort he could have just called him "Tom" instead... we already know that he despises the name and it doesn't make harry look childish but more indifferent or like he is discarding the threat that Voldemort does pose.

Also why the heck does Voldemort always seem to miss the point of a situation when harry calls him any kind of name? All of his Death Eaters just collapsed and he loses his head because harry calls him "Tommy Boy"??? Doesn't really seem likely does it?? Especially when the author first tries to portray him as a cruel and dangerous but most of all CUNNING individual!

In my opinion it would have been more in Character for him to in this situation either ask what the hell happened to his DEs or to nonchalantly fire a crucio at Harry as soon as he is called anything but Voldemort.

I mean i cant be the only one that is bothered by a supposedly serious character to suddenly break down in utter childishness.

Sorry for the Rant!

Kudos to all of you


** That's how many people are. The Allies made fun of Hitler in WW2, like the song that claimed he had just one ball. Some Germans had insulting names for him - "Gröfaz", coming from "Grösster Feldherr Aller Zeiten" - "Greatest Commander of all times", meant sarcastically, "Der Böhmische Gefreite", relating to his rank in WW1 (Private), "Teppichbeisser" referring the rumour he had bitten into a carpet in a bout of rage - etc. etc.

People mock their enemies. That's realistic.

*** True mocking your enemy is a pretty realistic thing but the how and when is what i am bothered by. If any of the allied soldiers had been in front of Hitler he wouldn't have called him Schmitler or something idiotic like that and he also wouldn't have told him the think he has only one testicle. He would have shot him in the fucking head. Then maybe with his comrades made some jokes about how pathetically he died.

And like i said it is in Harry potter already established that Voldemort isn't happy when called "Tom" so harry calling him that would be IMO more realistic in such a situation than him calling him "Tommy Boy"

​

Its just that many authors dont seem to be able to distinguish between dark/gallows humor and Childishness or in this case mistake apathy for Childishness. Or maybe i just misinterpret how the author wanted to portray Harry....

Moldyshorts is childish and only certain stories have that, but I'm not going to be upset at Tommy Boy.

** Personally, I think it's probably due to the saturation of Marvel Movies recently (generally recently, not like this year recently). Quippy one-liners in fights have pretty much always been a thing, but it seems to have become way more of one since the Marvel movie factory started up. Same with the childishness - half the 'insult-type' quotes that I've heard people make from those movies have all sounded vaguely playground-level. It's that kind of 'Tony Stark' type dynamic that keeps popping up. "Yes, it's me, I know. I'm amazing, but you're a poopy butthead."

**** Not quite. It's more that the Marvel movies popularised the 'Quippy Hero' dynamic and exposed more people to that kind of characterisation, so writers make an unconscious mimicry of those quippy, insulting dynamics and characterisations they've enjoyed and unconsciously choose to write a quippy, insulting Harry rather than writing, say, a more dour and angsty Harry that takes a more Hayden Christenson approach to battle talk. "You underestimate my power!".

They're not consciously saying "I'm going to write Harry like Iron Man!", but wanting to write a strong, sassy lead, they mimic the characterisation of that that they've seen and enjoyed and so we end up with quippy Harry doling out childish insults like Iron Man. We write what we know and all that. But it's definitely not adding in something that exists in Marvel and not in Harry Potter. After all, Canon Harry is defiantly sassy himself, so the sassy-insult dynamic does exist in the Potter-verse already.

So, yes and no? Ish? :D

** In the stuff I've written when a character, usually the main character calls Voldemort a silly name, it's less of a juvenile thing and more of politeness while still expressing dislike.

Calling him The Dark Lord signifies respect.

Calling him Voldemort is the social equivalent of shouting the N-word at a group of people.

So since both are discarded then you still have to call him something. Something that shows that you are not respecting him and that you are not afraid of him.

So a silly name like voldy or Tommy is a good way of showing other people this.

Although my characters tend to be very manipulative so it might also have something to do with that Haha

  Harry was sent to Azkaban after being framed for murder in the beginning of his 6th year at Hogwarts. While there, he unlocks the "Power the Dark Lord Knows Not". What will happen once his former friends know he's innocent? Watch the fun.

** Pissing off your opponent to make them angry intentionally is one of the most common tactics out there. A serious and determined Voldemort is FAR more scary than a "DIE POTTER DIE HOW DARE YOU INSULT ME!" sort of Voldemort.
