Hello, I'm looking for fics where Harry finds out Luna is being bullied and puts a stop to it, bonus points if he makes the bullies afraid of him or afraid of doing it again. Also if Harry is paired with anyone, please have it be Harry/any female pairing. Although not Cho or Pansy. Also if it is part of a series please give me the first fic in the series and explain in which fic it happens in the series. Thank you.


** I think there was The Merging on fanfiction

  Systematically abused and degraded children do not suddenly turn into well-adjusted members of society when removed from the abusive situation. Nor do they tend to be very trusting of others, or forgiving. Sequel up.
