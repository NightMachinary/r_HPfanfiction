Hagrid not being an idiot, being an Ã¼ber spell resistant warrior, totally being there for the main character in a kickass way, or just being generally awesome. Let's give Hagrid some love.

Slash, bashing, crossovers and dark!characters are fine. Please no harems, genderbending, mpreg, smut/romance-centric plots or pottercest.

  "Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?" ...Snape kicks Harry out of 'Remedial Potions', but as we know from The Philosopher's Stone, there is another Occlumens in the school good enough to keep out the Dark Lord. Stupid oneshot.

  "Now, this 'eres a Jarvey. Don't you listen to a word it says."

  Harry stared into the eyes of the ferret-like creature Hagrid was holding tightly in one fist.

  "Fuck you, guv," it said calmly in a rolling baritone. "And fuck the horse you rode in on too. And its dear old mom for good measure. Try me on for size, I'll bite your nuts off."

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
