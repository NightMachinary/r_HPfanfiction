  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** She appears for a rather short (yet crucial) role in HP:MOR recursive fanfiction Following the Phoenix linkffn(10636246) ...

It is a rather long read, considering you have to read 80 chapters of HP:MOR and then there's 37 FtP chapters in which the Queen appears for just two chapters.

  A single-/dual-point-of-departure spinoff from Less Wrong's brilliant story "Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality", branching away in Chapter 81. Hermione is sent to Azkaban, but Harry is not about to give up. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like his enemy is about to leave things alone either.

**** This is riddled with cliches and dubious plot devices, the most glaring of which is the use of special magic spheres which download Merlin's knowledge to our young protagonists' minds.

It does have one (sort of) redeeming quality: technically, the writing is good. So, if you are into the kind of stuff mentioned above, you could check it out I guess.
