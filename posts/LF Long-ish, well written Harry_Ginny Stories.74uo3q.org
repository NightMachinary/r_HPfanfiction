As above, I'm looking for long, well written Harry/Ginny stories

Edit: ~100k-250k words in length


** Linkffn(7058155) is a series of one shots where Harry and Ginny get together earlier, a little repetitive but it's a decent read.

Linkffn(12310652) it has them both accidentaly escaping together from Bill's wedding and they have to search the horocruxes, which are in alternate locations in the Muggle world

#+begin_quote
  When the Weasley wedding is attacked, Harry grabs the first hand that comes to mind - Ginny's. They find Voldemort has hidden his Horcruxes in plain sight out of some of Muggle history's most important artifacts. Now the pair go across the continent, risking capture by both the Muggle and wizarding worlds, to end the war. Post-HBP. AU. It's JKR's world. We just get a sandbox.

** On of my all-time favorites is linkffn(The Bonds of Blood by Darth Marrs). From the same author, you may also like linkffn(Unspeakable Things by Darth Marrs). If you like soulboung fics, consider linkffn(Meaning of One, Part One: Stone and Fire by Sovran) and its sequels (Skip first Chapter). I also liked linkffn(The Thorny Rose by Brennus) and its sequels.

  "He spotted Ginny two tables away; she was sitting with her head on her mother's shoulder: There would be time to talk later, hours and days and maybe years in which to talk." -- DH pg. 745. He didn't think it would be that easy...did he? **Completed**

*** This fic single-handedly made me hate Neville in general. [[/spoiler][The fact that Ginny and Neville becoming close during the battle isn't so far out left field made it easy to hate him I suppose]]

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating
