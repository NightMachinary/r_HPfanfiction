Basically as the title says, but IIRC it is a fic where Harry is the brother of the BWL, and is a couple years older than him. He also goes on an entire explanation as to why the house elves need to be in servitude to the wizards.

Please help me find this fic I've been looking for weeks and it seems to keep eluding me.


** Well, ah, there's this one? [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5058703/chapters/11633524]] But you might want more detail than that, since "harry correcting hermione on spew" is exceedingly common in do-overs, fix-it fics, and want of a nail fics.

Length of fic? Pairings? Other details? Or is this fic only a few thousand words long and ONLY focuses on reimagining that one SPEW scene?
