For the one summoned looks to be as old as Dumbledore himself, is none too pleased at having his retirement interrupted, and has long since grown weary of people begging him to once again play the hero and save everyone from their own stupidity.

Bonus points if he acts the grumpy old curmudgeon towards everyone bar Molly (he always did have a soft spot for her home cooking, and mourned long and hard at her passing) without it descending into bashing territory.


** This could also be a nice way to make a powerful Harry who has actually earned his power through over a century of magic knowledge and experience.

** But he still can't let Voldemort win, regardless how much he despises playing the hero.

In fact, he's more than ever pissed about forcing kids to play heroes and becoming child soldiers.

So, he demands absolute freedom in dealing with Voldemort and no interference whatsoever from Dumbledore, and a very strong binding magical contract to affirm this demand.

Then he goes and kills all of them in less than a week. As for Voldemort, he uses one Horcrux as a lead to trap Voldemort's main soul in an object.

*** I spent ONE HUNDRED YEARS doing humanitarian work so that no child has to be forced to do what I did. There's no way I'm going to sit back and let this happen again.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP
