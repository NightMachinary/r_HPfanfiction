There's been a lot of talk about "muggle" real-world technology changing rapidly in the next 50 years . My question is, how would that reflect in the Wizarding World? As a reference, 50 years from 2017 (the year Albus enters Hogwarts).

For instance, the 1970's saw the development of the Wolfsbane Potion, so I think it's reasonable to find some magical cure for lycanthropy by 2067. Some things, due to thematic reasons, might never be "solved" though. I feel like no counter curse (aside from a physical body) can block the Killing Curse, even with 50 years of experimentation and magical advancements.


** Killing Curse is just a single target attack with quite limited range. I would be far more worried about some crazies smuggling nukes in those magical trunks and detonate them during the Quidditch World Cup. 20% of world's magical population could be wiped out in a single instant.

The primary security concern of magical governments should be the safety of Muggle nuclear weapons and defense against mind control attacks. These two threats combined could lead to world-ending events.

*** All it takes is for someone to plant subconscious legilimency suggestions or memory alterations in a big enough muggle political figure and suddenly you've got a war brewing.

Also, I never got why the killing curse was so terrible: it's probably the cleanest killing spell in the entire series. No pain, just instant lights out and moving on. Not to mention, it's relatively slow-moving (compared to a bullet, as it can be dodged), is bright green (crappy for stealth warfare unless cast point-blank so that their body muffles the flash), requires an incantation (I'm not sure about this, but I don't think anyone's ever cast a wordless AK in canon) and has a limited range (so no sniping someone from two miles away).

** Fusion of muggle science and magic by enterprising muggleborns coming from improved muggle education standards (as those at least are always going up). Potential Magic of Mass Destruction when one of them figures out how to magically split (or fuse) the atom, allowing any mage to be or create extremely cheap nuclear weaponry. If the wizarding world is discovered and the integration goes sour, it'll only take a few days at most before some pureblood snaps, apparates into the centre of London/Beijing/New York and casts the nuclear detonation spell.

Even if the MMD never gets invented, you still have a population of people capable of smuggling literally anything through muggle customs with magically expanded pockets and a confundus charm or two. Not to mention, if they didn't care about being magically detected, they could simply apparate over international borders before fishing an old, active Soviet warhead out of their trunk in downtown Moscow.

After a certain point, any war between magicals and muggles will be extremely bloody and likely an extinction-level event for the whole planet. It's not easy to say who will be the winner, as the muggles have numbers, whereas the wizards have unparalleled global guerrilla strike capabilities and can strike infrastructure/command with impunity, but each wizard lost will be a relatively heavy blow.

*** Extinction level catastrophe is bound to happen, the question is not if, but when.

Fusion of magical and Muggle military applications will speed up this process.

The only solution I see to escape this certain destruction of humanity is to head out to stars or alternate worlds before that happens.

** Hm...

Call me an asshole if you wish, but:

Not at all probably (minor stuff excluded), I mean the magical world looks like it has been the same for hundreds (if not a thousand!) years, so it appears pretty stagnant with only minor tweaks to some spells made every now and then!

I mean tampering with "muggle artifacts" is more or less forbidden (so no fusing of muggle and magical stuff), magicals don't need computers, cars etc. (they have instant teleportation and pens that write by themselves or with voice recognition (that actually works, unlike voice recognition on modern computers which is not always accurate!)) and after Voldemort is defeated nothing really changes, the stuffy purebloods that survive get away with murder mostly (for example the Malfoys! They should all be in prison, not all of them for life, but for a long long time and they should be fined heavily, but they weren't!) and muggleborns are still second class citizens (not Hermione of course, she married a Pureblood after all and is a war hero) and the world still kind of is stuck in the victorian age (robes? really?...) :(

** While there will be a few minor changes in the likes of new potions, there's little reason to change how things are done because magic is very reality breaking. As entropy, aside from on the human body, has little to do with the magical world, there's no need to advance, to innovate.

*** That's interesting!

My view is that while magic is reality breaking, how wizards understand/use it may change over time. This "understanding" is what results in new innovation. For instance, apparition, portkey, and floo travel are all different ways of travel, and judging by their effects, they seem to have different magical properties. It's also reasonable to suggest that they were all invented at different times.

Do you feel like it's possible that wizarding society might find some new magical ways of traveling? I guess this also brings up the question on whether or not there exists a better way of magical teleportation that is undiscovered. Or is apparition/portkeys the absolute best that can exist?

Or, for flight, there's brooms. Yet, Riddle was able to demonstrate self flight, which was pretty innovative in my opinion.

Side note: I have this idea, that in the future a new commodity would be winged footwear that allows for limited flight or floating(inspired by Hermes). I can imagine a business like Weasley's Wizard Wheezes selling these.

**** There's so little reason to innovate. And a pair of winged footwear wouldn't be innovation.

Creating a broom to go to the moon would be innovation. Or to mars. Changing the staid wizard culture is what my story darkness ascendant is about in the b plot

***** Brooms were obviously gravity manipulation devices. So using the very magic that powered Brooms to generate artificial gravity would be a major innovation, and extremely useful.
