** Translation: Post-war, canon-compliant stories but without Harry as a main character. Higher-quality writing.

#+begin_quote
  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

** First of all, I agree with Hogwarts Houses Divided. One of my favorite fics.

*One-shots (short fics)*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6167455/1/Things-Unsaid][Things Unsaid]] - what if each character that died in the series got one last line? It's short and really very touching. I cry every time I get to Lupin's or Cedric's.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8461800/1/The-Twine-Bracelet][The Twine Bracelet]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize][Cauterize]] both center on Colin Creevy, and are generally touching (but sad) fics.

*Longer Fics*

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/821297/chapters/1556418][Saying Yes]] is about Andromeda Tonks (Tonks' mom) and Kingsley slowly getting together.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4882577/1/A-Bit-Unhealthy][A Bit Unhealthy]] is about George and Angeline coping with Fred's death.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/Exile][Exile]] is about Malfoy being sentenced to live for a few years without Magic as punishment for his crimes. It's actually one of the best stories I've seen with Draco being "redeemed" and learning how wrong his prejudices were. The only downside is that it's still in progress (but almost done if the last chapter was any indication).

*A full fledged series*

[[http://www.jamespotterseries.com/muggle_index.html][The James Potter Series]] follows Harry's son James throughout Hogwarts. I was a big fan of the first few books, but I never finished the series because I wasn't happy with some of the later ones (starting with the book where they all go to the US for a year).

e: I finally got around to reading this, and it's quite excellent. Not much action, but it's all about Draco figuring his life out. Strongly recommend.

** Speaking of Inverarity (the guy who wrote Hogwarts, Houses Divided) I think the Alexandra Quick series needs a shoutout here. The series is completely independent of the original Harry Potter series, although it occurs in the same universe at some point after the conclusion of HP&TDH.

The Alexandra Quick series takes place in America and follows the eponymous protagonist as she discovers her magic and enters the magical society of America.

One of my favorite things about this series is the way that it makes American society feel different from the British society we are familiar with from Harry Potter, while also maintaining enough similarities that it still feels like the Harry Potter universe.

My other favorite thing is how well written the series is, to the point where it feels more like an original story (which it basically is) than like fanfiction.

With four 'books' done, clocking in at about 200k words each, this has to be by far my favorite series in the Harry Potter fandom, with an interesting (if flawed) hero, excellent worldbuilding, and an awesome overarching plot which (in my opinion) blows the overarching Voldemort plot from the original series out of the water.

Anyway, without further ado, here is the link to the first book, linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle)

#+begin_quote
  This is the first of a series of books I wrote for my kids set in the Harry Potter setting and occurring at the same time. These stories are meant to interweave seamlessly with the HP books and focus on characters primarily in the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff houses. The Tamblin books are a tad darker than the HP books, starting at about the level of the 3rd or 4th HP book.

** Hogwarts Houses Divides is straight up amazing as others have said. If you want one that picks up where Cursed Child ends and has phenomenal characterizations of the grown-up trio with a focus on their kids (namely Albus), I cannot recommend linkffn(put your guns away, it's tea time) nearly enough! The sequel is ongoing and equally great, with more action and mystery than the first one and the same amount of heart. :)

Editing to add that you don't have to have read Cursed Child to understand or enjoy this story! I haven't read or seen it, just heard summaries from people on here.

  But I think that Harry's story is finished,so I want stories with new characters or even his kids messing around in Hogwarts
#+end_quote

I think what you really mean is you are done with CANON Harry at Hogwarts story. Well, most HP fanfics are AU (alternate universe) anyway. Here are some of my favorites:

/Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw/, linkffn(11574569), is quite interesting and very well written. It's also set in a very different world.

/Divided and Entwined/, linkffn(11910994), is AU after Year 4, and depicts an all out civil war in magical Britain. Hermione is the main character here.

/The Stars Alone/, linkffn(12040341), is a SG-1 crossover and sequel to /Broken Chains/, linkffn(7718942), which is a Star Wars crossover. In this story, Harry, Hermione, and Luna were building a new civilization from the scratch and taking on the Goa'ulds.

/Petrification Proliferation/, linkffn(11265467), is a humorous take on what would have been if the adults had behaved more competent after the CoS incident.

/The Sum of Their Parts/, linkffn(11858167), is a post DH dark!Trio fic. Harry and Co was again betrayed by the establishment after Voldemort's fall. They had it enough and decided to fight back again, with ANY MEANS necessary.

/Seventh Horcrux/, linkffn(10677106), is an excellent humor fic and my top favorite.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.
