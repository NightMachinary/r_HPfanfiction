The past few months I've been watching the British Tv show Merlin. The other day I got to the season 4 premier. In the premier Morganna opens up the gates to the other world, or more specifically the world of the dead. When I saw this is reminded me of the death veil in the DoM and a thought came to me, What if when Sirius fell in the veil, instead of dying, he ended up going through the veil in the time of Merlin. So far I haven't been able to find any fanfic's with this happening so I was hoping that someone would be able to find something similar to this. It doesn't even have to be Sirius who falls through the veil, but the general idea of it being the same.


** I got excited for a moment, I thought you might be looking for a cross-over with the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin_%28miniseries%29][American miniseries]].

The tv series is okay too.

  */Merlin/* is a television [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniseries][miniseries]] which originally aired in 1998 on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC][NBC]] that retells the legend of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Arthur][King Arthur]] from the perspective of the wizard [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin_(wizard)][Merlin]]. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Neill][Sam Neill]] stars in the title role in a story that covers not only the rise and fall of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camelot][Camelot]] but also the phase in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter_of_Britain][legendary history]] of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain][Britain]] that precedes it.

  The film deviates from more traditional versions of the legend, notably by including new characters such as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Mab][Queen Mab]] and by keeping Merlin through the whole reign of King Arthur over Britain (whereas in older versions Merlin left earlier on in the king's reign). The film was followed by a sequel in 2006, /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin%27s_Apprentice][Merlin's Apprentice]]/, which was more loosely connected with traditional [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthurian_legend][Arthurian legend]].

*** I thought he meant the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lost_Years_of_Merlin][The Lost Years of Merlin]] book series at first. I loved those as a kid, but I do like this tv show as well. I binge-watched it one very shameful week in undergrad.

  */The Lost Years (originally calledThe Lost Years of Merlin)/* is a work of literature by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._A._Barron][T. A. Barron]], published by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin_Group][Penguin Group USA]]. It tells the tale of the legendary wizard [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin][Merlin]]'s youth. Though the character Merlin is world famous as an ancient wizard, this story of his lost youth is original to the author. The title applies to both the first book in the series, and also to the entire eleven-book epic.

** Ha! I'm currently watching S3EP10 on Netflix right now when I read this. Stopped reading after you mentioned S4 though, wary of spoilers!

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&work_search%5Bquery%5D=harry+potter+merlin][This is not is a list of recommendations (I haven't read any of these) but it is a link to the Harry Potter/Merlin crossover fanfics on this website. I hope it works.]]

This is a shameless plug - I'm writing a fanfic that isn't a crossover with BBC's Merlin but contains a lot of the same source material and works with concepts like the Otherworld, Avalon and Morgana and Merlin. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3705335][It's called Ynys Afal: The Island of Apples and I am currently on chapter four (42000 words).]] I'd like you to check it out (of course I would, I wrote it!) but I think even though it isn't exactly what you wanted you might end up enjoying where it goes anyway.

Hope the first link was helpful - it should work even if you don't have an account there. If it doesn't I'll link the best-rated fics individually!
