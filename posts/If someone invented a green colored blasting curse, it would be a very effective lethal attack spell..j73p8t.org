Since a killing curse goes through shield charms, someone seeing green coming towards them would try to get behind or conjure solid cover. Which would protect from a killing curse, but the blasting curse would just turn it into a cloud of deadly shrapnel.

For more effectiveness, throw some real killing curses into the mix.

*** Also a good idea, but depending on what the rules for spellcrafting are that might be significantly more difficult.

While there's many ways to kill people - and many ways to cause things to blow up - as far as we know Avada Kedavra is unique in several ways.

In the spellcrafting rules I'm using, it'd be relatively easy to create new blasting curses that blow things up in new ways but very difficult (like Nobel prize level) to modify or reverse-engineer the killing curse.

***** Besides Arithmancer there is also HPMOR, which is nerdier imho, but does more violence to canon so it's polarizing here. See hpmor.com or [[/r/hpmor][r/hpmor]]. It doesn't talk much about spellcrafting per se, but it has considerable reverse engineering of magic. Actual creation of new spells is described as very dangerous, so the most powerful wizards are the ones who have collected secret ancient lore. It actually describes the exact way that the killing curse works.

** The thing with Unforgivable Curses is that until the rise of Voldemort they were not really used. They seem to us, the readers, as something done on a daily basis because many of the book scenes focus on instances where they are used. Furthermore, as we directly see from the battle of DoM (despite only Harry and the Prophecy being of interest, other than Bellatrix, no Death Eater fights to kill), the battle of the seven Potters (the only kill is done by Voldemort despite the Order being outnumbered at least 3 to 1) and the battle of Hogwarts (the casualty number is way less than you'd expect for an army of children fighting experienced dark wizards, giants, dementors and acromantulas), the Death Eaters themselves do not seem too eager to throw killing curses.

Also there are other green flashed hexes and jinxes such as Ron's slug vomiting one.

That's why I think most people that did not actively fight in Voldemort's wars would not even associate a green lighting with the killing curse. Or at least not in the heat of the battle when you need to think really fast.

** Very interesting idea, but if I ever wrote fic, I don't think I'd do it. Too many possibilities. I'd like to think my Fanon is that optical effects of spells happens mostly because of their magical components. I.e. a lot of really dark charms or stuff to do with death is coloured greenish, while a lot of normal curses are on a sunset spectrum, i.e. yellow, orange, red, blue, purple.

It'd be very interesting in a fic with my fanon because duels would have less ambiguity. See an orange spell heading for you? you don't know what it is, but because it's orange in colour, it's probably a schoolyard spell, so you can probably reverse it with a finite, or a higher level finite-like spell.

Interesting idea though, it'd be a big bruh moment if that happened. Imagine you think you're just about to take a simple Stupefy, but then your entrails explode out of you.

** Voldemort and some Death Eaters could throw around killing curses with the same effort as casting a stinging hex because they where all deranged, murderous psychopaths. To properly cast the AK you not only have to have an extremely strong will, but also have a /desire/ to cast it, a *need* for that person to be dead, you have to have 0 empathy otherwise it simply won't work.

So outside of fighting Death Eaters remnants and the occasional murderer post-Voldemort, 99% of people, even Aurors won't see a killing curse in their lifetime, let alone have to worry about people tricking them with copy-cat spells.

** It always strikes me that while it has a lot of magic that is lethal at concealment, tracking, mental manipulation and sabotage/assassination, in direct combat the Wizarding World has very little in the way of squad-or-larger-scale combat tactics. Most battles boil down to one on one or two on one (or for exceptional combatants, three on one) duels that mostly amount to throwing curses and hexes at the other guy while trying to dodge or block what they send at you. There doesn't seem to be any sort of real unit-level cohesion or tactics. Even in a bigger battle, like Hogwarts, its pretty much the same on a bigger scale, with the addition of an opening bombardment at range to take down the enemy's defensive spells.

It makes a certain sense, I guess- their population is too small for large scale warfare to be a common occurance, and their magic and society are both geared more toward cloak and dagger than open battle, and its a traditionalist society who's main weapon (the wand) has fundamentally not changed in hundreds or thousands of years. But innovations like this could be as deadly (on a smaller scale) as the machine gun and poison gas were to European armies that hadn't learned much since Napoleon.

Also think about working as a squad, rather than individual duelists- one guy shields or transfigures barriers, a couple others lay down suppressing fire, a couple others try to flank, while another throws area-effect curses or animates statues or something from the rear.
