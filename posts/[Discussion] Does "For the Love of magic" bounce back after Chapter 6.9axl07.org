I really enjoyed the start of linkffn(For Love of magic). The first few chapters made some very bold moves that subverted a few expectations like [[/spoiler][Killing off Hermione and having a "brilliant scheme" backfire ending up in Dobby's death]] and dealing with those events in a realistic way which I respected. He had a little extra power which was fine because that was the premise of the fic.

But then the rune etching began. At first I was fine with it because he was warned of consequences but then the "Side effects" turned out to be:\\
-Owls can't find him (which is so far the only negative consequence but has had not major impact on him)\\
-He is prone to feeling more "anger" which just means he uses his power to steamroll over anyone who antagonises him and gets away with it anyway because he's TBWL and too badass now to care.\\
-He shoots through puberty and becomes a sex god which leads to a statuatory rape that is played off as no big deal because "wizards" and "It's fine when it happens to boy".

But asside from that he becomes a master of wandless magic and gains perfect health.

This was when I stopped as it seemed the fic was about to start running downhill and was wondering if it was worth continuing. Does Harry actually face hard consequences for his rune rituals at some point? Was there a point to the whole wild detailed sex scene with the muggle girl? I could forgive it if maybe she ended up pregnant or something and then that's a shitstorm Harry isn't able to deal with but otherwise it seems like it was there just to highlight how much of a sex god he is and as a means of subtle Ginnybashing.

lmao. Yeah the smut is actually half the fic. That scene was actually mild in comparison to what comes after.

But it's a mess, and I wouldn't suggest continuing.

** The fic continues to include lots of little bits and pieces which are interesting. The author is clearly imaginative when it comes to magic. However, the story becomes massively bogged down in smut and Harry's pursuit of women to add to his "collection". You could probably trim the wordcount by over 50% without losing any of the plot. Also, it becomes increasingly clear as the fic goes on that Harry is acting as an authorial mouthpiece for the broadcasting of real life political views, which is never fun.

** I stopped, I think, at chapter 8. I can handle smut if it's well-written and has some interesting relationships with a larger plot, but the combination of god-moding, Harry becoming unlikable, and chapters that kept plodding on did it for me.

** I was ok for about 80% - not great, but some interesting ideas.

Then the author turned Harry into a Islamophobic, mysongistic asshole. He was cramming his own insane political beliefs into it - like women crashing the economy because people can pay us less, or that any Muslim in power insanity dangerous - and then he got upset when people called him on his bullshit.

Honestly, I wish I could delete my previous good reviews of his story.

** I almost got to 80% of it, but then even I gave up. And I am someone who enjoys good smut. It just keeps distracting from the main plot. Also the plot barely survived at that point, it was just a jackass Harry planting his dick in as many girls as he could find.

** Honestly, the whole fic is a trainwreck. There will be some more consequences to come with Harry's runes, his morality will degrade over time in part because of them. This consequence is mostly meaningless because the people whose opinion he cares about have their morality degrade with him, and of course, everyone else is either too weak or too scared to oppose him in any meaningful way.

Everything else I have to say about this fic has already been said by someone here so, I won't repeat it.

** I will say yes because it is interesting to see what the world of magic looks like for this author.

But I also really was reading for the smut and we (pleasantly surprised) by the depth of detail in the magic/history of the world.

** This fic is basically a guilty pleasure piece with a surprising amount of worldbuilding, plot progression and cause-and-effect.

It's not, however, The Great Gatsby.Or maybe it is, but just buried under so many layers of smut and controversy that you have a hard time seeing it.

** I take why it gets so much hate, I really do, but I really enjoy the smut and really don't get why people get so angry at it, as far as Harry "godmoding" well yes he does, but I think it's a lot more rewarding than the usual "He has a very BIG magical core, his power is over 9000!!!" bullshit we usually get, of course he has the boon that his runes get him but his power comes from his understanding of magic and it is actually shown in the fic, not just "he practiced for months in the room of requirement and got out overpowered"

as far as consequences from the runes, not really, he becomes emotionally stunted somewhat incapable of caring too much for people besides his 3 "main" girls and he start shoeing a great disregard for the life of those he doesn't care about to the point of doing rather gross human experiments with his enemies, mainly death eaters

*** [[/spoiler][Well the vampires apparently figured out that there is going to be a Societal collapse on a global scale so they were trying to save as many Humans as possible so they don't run out of blood, but not saving enough that mankind could survive on their own. So hey give this info to Harry and Harry decides to Magic nuke the world and kill 7 billion people. Now all Humans will probably be born with magic. He told the vampires to act as predators to humans so humans can actually become strong. Then Harry and vampires are mostly chummy-buddies. The whole line about "nothing short of a god can stop whats coming" referred to that]]
