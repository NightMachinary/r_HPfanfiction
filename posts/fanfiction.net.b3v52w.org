[[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction .net]] now has advertising in the fanfiction text why did they think it would be a good idea i now need to use a ad-blocker because it is annoying as fuck. Is the advertising by anybody else so annoying is just by me?


** Online ads aren't just annoying, they can be dangerous even when not clicked on. On the other hand, maintaining a website with millions of stories and millions of users isn't easy and costs money.

Does anyone know if FFN has a way to provide them financial support? I would give them $5 a month if there was a way, but I don't see anything obvious on their site.

** OK, I've been seeing this place all over and like...is it on the FFN app or something? Cause I've been using it in my browser and have seen absolutely zero change...and I don't run Adblock or anything...

**** I use mobile mostly and I had this problem a few days ago. 10 or so ads were out in between paragraphs, depending on how large the chapter was. It seems to be fine now so I don't know what the issue was.

*** Ditto. I just ran through a bunch of random fics on the site and saw no intrusive ads on any story. The usual sidebar and top/bottom ads on the works' pages are still there, but that's been the case for years.

Of course, now that I've mentioned it, I'll see a dozen in a row.

*** It's been fixed for me on android chrome. It got fixed the day after it started.

I don't know about other platforms or browsers because the only other platform I use I also use adblock so I wouldn't have noticed anyway.

*** I would hazard a guess that it's the overwhelming use of ad-blockimg in the first place that leads to further more intrusive ads for everyone who doesn't use them.

**** They couldn't get much more intrusive when I started using an adblocker. We already had the popups, regular redirects, redirects that don't let you close the tab normally, and fake download buttons galore.

** I have the same problem. starting yesterday, ads started appearing in text every 2000 words or so. the exact same ad per chapter. annoying af. I don't use ad blocker on mobile since it is more trouble than it is worth with certain websites, it's easier to just avoid ad filled websites on the phone. never thought fanfiction.net would be the one that would force me to download a adblocking browser on my phone

** Use a fanfic downloader, read in the google books app (or whatever iOS equivalent there is if that's your jam). It's what I did as soon as I first saw those ads. Ads this intrusive are inexcusable, fuck them.

*** My groceries doesn't break my concentration by trying to get my attention all the time. They don't move, they don't flash, and they're dead silent.

I don't mind "old school" ads. It was the moving, blinking, flashing, and noisy ads that made me install the ad blocker in the first place. After that the ads just got worse and my ad blocker stays. They started this shit.
