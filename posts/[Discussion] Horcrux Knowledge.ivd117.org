How common was it before DH to the magical population? I mean, it's supposed to be dark and secret. However, Tom Riddle having Hogwarts as his only source was able to find about them. Also a young professor Slughorn, who was specialized in Potions, not DADA, knew something about them. Young Riddle was certain to a degree Slughorn would be able to answer his question as well. Were Horcrux common knowledge to people as Hogwarts Professors? Or was Slughorn a particular case?

*** True that. It was my idea. But then the question is how Riddle and Slughorn were so aware of them. Did Potions interested somehow with Horcrux Knowledge for him to review that? And how did Riddle knew that Slughorn knew about it?

**** I personally think that Slughorn in his youth was enamoured with famous Slytherins because he wanted to know how they build they're connections and came through research on Salazar and subsequently Parseltounge to the Tale of Herpo the Foul and his creation of the Horcrux

***** It might also be because the Horcrux ritual required some potion IIRC?

** Maybe the room of requirements had a book on them? We know that riddle had access to the room and could have found a book there. For Slughorn just because he's a potion professor doesn't mean he doesn't know about the dark arts. I'm curious if it's actually illegal to learn anything about the dark arts or just discouraged to learn by the general population.

** Slughorn said it was a banned subject at Hogwarts - which means anywhere else people freely knew about them/taught about them. It's just magical Britain being magical Britain, where nobody knows about it there because everyone learns at Hogwarts and never learns about them!
