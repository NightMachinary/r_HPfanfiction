How do you choose when to capitalize spells or not? And stuff like place names - do you capitalize Gryffindor Common Room? Or is it just Gryffindor common room? Do people use the Disarming spell? Idk, I'm a native english speaker whose knowledge of grammar can be summed up as "it just feels right"


** It's Gryffindor common room, but the Great Hall, the Room of Requirement, and even Gryffindor Tower are capitalized. It's probably because "Gryffindor common room" is technically a description and not an actual name, or something odd like that.

Spell names and incantations are always capitalized. Disarming Charm, Expelliarmus, Shield Charm, Protego, etc. But a description of a spell that is not its name would not be capitalized. So if multiple spells that produce shields exist in your story, you could refer to them all as shield spells or shield charms. But /the/ Shield Charm is capitalized when used as a name.

And while we're on the topic, I'll point out that Rowling also capitalized all the words she made up, like Muggle, Quidditch, and Auror. In those cases I don't think anyone will mind too much if you ditch the capitalization, as long as you're consistent.

When in doubt, just check the books and follow Rowling's lead.

** I always italicize when someone is casting spells and only capitalize words like Hogwarts and Gryffindor. As in the Hogwart's library and the Gryffindor common room.

It changes up with my house elves, though. I use caps to show how they emphasize certain places or things. Like instead of the Hogwart's hospital wing, it is the Hogwart's Hospital Wing.

** Names (people, places, spells) are capitalized.

Incantations get italicized if they're casting, not if they just talk about it. For example "It's Wingardium Leviosa" "Ok, /Wingardium Leviosa/" and the feather starts floating.

** It really depends on the spell. If you're doing the incantation, it's almost always capitalized and italicized. Such as spells like /Lumos/, /Expelliarmus/, and /Avada Kedavra/. When you're describing spells, it also depends.

The Killing Curse, Torture Curse, and the Imperius Curse are capitalized but not italicized because those are different names for the Unforgivables, but they're also a descriptor and not the incantation. It would be the same thing with saying, "he sent a Stunner toward the wizard" or "he Apparated away" because those aren't incantations and more of a descriptor of the spells. However, you could also be non-specific about the spell and say, "he used a fire-making charm to light the fire" or "he levitated the feather" or something similar and you wouldn't capitalize or italicise.

I would recommend using [[https://potterwords.livejournal.com/9493.html][Potterwords]] on LiveJournal. I used it a lot when I first started out writing Harry Potter fanfics and it also provides a lot of details and descriptions for things if you've forgotten them.

** I'm of the same mind.

Whenever I write I generally focus on a sense of flow than any grammatical accuracy.

Not to say I completely ignore grammar but I do throw it out the window when it starts ruining my flow.

Call it bad writing, or whatever, but its how I write.
