Just read the latest chapter of Limpieza de Sangre and I was wondering what are your theories on where this story will/should go?

It'll be even better if the author can come and tell us a bit more about what he/she (not sure sorry) has in mind.

Also I can't link the fanfic because I don't know how and i'm on mobile so i'm not sure if it'll work.

Probably going to happen: Emily is dead dead but Harry continues and succeeds in winning her war in the last chapter.

Big if true: Emily and Harry wake up in bed, and this story was just a dream the whole time.

** Emily could have merged with Harry

EDIT: I'm pretty certain now this is what happened. Emily couldn't have truly died because of Harry's scar, but Harry didn't feel her presence anymore so that's the only explanation left.

**** Harry was never cursed. There's a lot of very minor exposition leading up to that detailing what happens.

First he notices that he's actually taller than her now.

Second he learns that the thoughts in his head are not always his thoughts. The thoughts in his head are the narration.

The horcrux in him starts freaking out, thinking it's about to die. When he starts to act a few more minor things happen.

First: he notices when she raises the wand that it seems too low to be level with his heart. Given that he just noticed that he was taller than her, just below his heart, is level with her heart.

Second: His internal narration, part of which is still confused and thinks she wants him to curse himself, notices that his hands feel backwards in that moment. While he 'thinks' they should be pointing at him, backwards then could be construed to be that they are pointing in the other direction. Or, at her.

At this point her hands are wrapped around his and she isn't even holding her wand. And the only wand, when the curse is muttered, is pointed at her.

I've left it vague as to who actually casts the spell. If the reader thinks Harry is powerful enough to do so and actually succeed in killing her, then it's certainly possible to believe it that way.

On the flip side, we know Emily can cast said spell. So she could have just done it herself through Harry.

6) Will we ever find out what the note says? Not asking for spoilers about what it is I just wanna know if I'll ever get closure on it cus that sort of thing bugs me (looking at you Jojo part 4).

  First he notices that he's actually taller than her now.

1) Does this mean he's absorbed part of her? I'm thinking literally, of course. Like a Pillar Man or The Thing.

#+end_quote

2) That sounds hot af. We gonna see that in the future? I'm thinking *(NSFW)* [[https://www.oglaf.com/shield-maiden/][The Invincible Sheledmaiden from Oglaf]] in case you were wondering.

3) I read some pretty heavy implications in the last chapter that Harry will be Emily's dead husband. Admittedly I'm also the kind of guy who thinks that time travel and obliviation are totally believable ways to keep my ships afloat but anyway, any chance of that happening?

4) I noticed you posting something about HP pornos a year or so ago, have you given any thought to just going full Harry/Emily smut for your next few dozen chapters? I'm sure that the reviewers on ffn (who totes aren't 14 year olds but even if they were they're really mature for their age and have upvoted everyone who has disagreed with them btw) would be down to help if you run low on ideas.

5) Barring that, I saw some pretty open ended insinuations that Emily was a yaoi fangirl who shipped Avery and Harry and booked them on a romantic cruise. Is this fic gonna turn to mpreg? I'm not saying I wouldn't be down to read it, but I'm definitely hoping that their kid's birth will be more Alien than Caesarian [[https://i.imgur.com/HW2WP0M.gif][if you know what I mean.]]

******* I never asked what the note said because I didn't think it was important. It's a kind of mini MacGuffin in that the contents obviously matter to the characters (Avery obeys it without question, and Harry accepts him on that basis) but that we don't need to know exactly what it is.

Sorry but I'd prefer this not be what happens. Better to see some prose with an additional epilogue (or leave the ending ambiguous) than to have the author come on and explain.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

** Personally I see a few ways this could go down 1.) The end. After 30 chapters, the author leaves the ending ambiguous. Not bad, but leaves a bit unanswered. 2.) The horcrux in Harry's scar hasn't been destroyed yet, but at the same time mathematically holds only a small portion of Emily's soul, so the author could do something with that. 3.) We get an epilogue where Harry travels the world and does amazing stuff that Emily couldn't/didn't do 4.) (This is dark and SUPER unlikely) Harry comes back and basically picked up where Emily started. Hold on to your hats folks, because Harry's back and darker than ever!
