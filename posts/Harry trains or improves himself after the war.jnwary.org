** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]]: Harry and friends declare war on the incorrigible establishment, and the Trio has become immensely powerful through relentless training. He's the new dark lord.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]]: Harry and Hermione led a revolution that killed off the incorrigible establishment, but that's only the beginning. They are scarily powerful, and yet Ron is the real hero in this fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/][Contractual Invalidation]]: Head Auror Harry Potter uses the marriage contract situation with Daphne Greengrass to advance his career and agenda. He seems quite powerful and ruthless in those few fight scenes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/][A Black Comedy]]: Harry falls through the Veil a few years after the war and joins Sirius in a new dimension. Together they wreck lots of havoc. Voldemort is still around there, but there's also "that fucker".

** Loose Cannon is exactly about Harry realizing he's miserable training as an auror and goes looking for other things in life. linkffn(13452914)

**** Losse Canon is good but it doesn't fit all of you criteria. I haven't seen many stories with those specs and none that are more than 10k words. Now I admit I haven't read every story out there but I've certainly read more than most considering how many years I've been apart of the fanfiction community. I really can't think of any that pop into my mind. Loose Canon is more or less about a high strung emotionally fucked up Harry realizing that he doesn't want to fight bad guys and would rather play quidditch and score some tail. However the author does it in a way that's pretty unique and very enjoyable. I'll admit that once I hit the latest chapters that I found I was getting a little bored and didn't want to read anymore. But the author updates either every other day or every day. Worth it. Would recommend.

***** It updates roughly weekly but yeah the last like half of the story has been dragging super hard for me. Hopefully it picks up at some point but I might shelf it for a while and check back at a later date to see if it does.

****** It now has 93 chapters. I commented 2 days ago. I think it had something in the low fifties for chapters and somewhere between 300 to 350 thousand words. Now it has high 700 hundreds of thousands of words. WTF?!?!

  He survived the war---now it's time to grow up. Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. OCs galore. NO MORTAL PERIL.
