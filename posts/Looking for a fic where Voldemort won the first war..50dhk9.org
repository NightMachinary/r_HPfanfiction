I Would like anything on the theme. Don't care if Dark!Harry or Light!Harry. All requirements are that Voldemort won. There may be a resistance or may not be. I prefer slash but have nothing against straight.


** Does it count if he "officially" won the war? I've written a story where he was defeated by Harry, but Lucius Malfoy faked the Dark Lord's survival, and took over Britain in his name (to later betray him). The story is set about 20 years after that, in Malfoy's "New Britain".

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - and Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** This one has some of the best classroom and battle scenes I've ever come across! Though it is unfinished and hasn't been updated in quite a while. Picks up in 4th year. linkffn(champion by octaviusowl). Highly recommended even in its unfinished state.

#+end_quote

If you're at all interested in other villains besides Voldemort, check out linkffn(reign of the serpent). It's seriously one of the best fics out there plot-wise and the author's take on Hogwarts (and the world) during the reign of evil that's going on is really cool. The character development in the later chapters is pretty good too. It's unfinished but I'm pretty sure it's not dead.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".
