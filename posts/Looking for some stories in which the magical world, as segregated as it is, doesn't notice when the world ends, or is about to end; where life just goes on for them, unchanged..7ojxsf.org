** That would be pretty funny. A Muggleborn decides to visit the Muggle world again and finds a zombie apocalypse instead.

** I could imagine following scenarios:

September 26, 1983, Soviet nuclear early-warning systems detected [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_Soviet_nuclear_false_alarm_incident][multiple US Minuteman III ICBM launches]]. In our world, Lieutenant Colonel Stanislav Yevgrafovich Petrov correctly dismissed the warning as false-alarms, preventing a retaliatory nuclear attack and subsequent full-scale nuclear war. In this AU, the Soviet officer in charge made the opposite decision, which eventually led to global thermonuclear war.

November 10, 1983, NATO exercise [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Able_Archer_83][Able Archer 83]] went out of control. Soviet Union interpreted it falsely as a covert NATO first strike, and things escalated quickly to global thermonuclear war a few days later.

In this other world, [[https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&ei=QxxRWp6eJ-aA0wKbo6egAg&q=wopr+war+games&oq=wopr&gs_l=psy-ab.3.0.0i67k1l2j0i10k1j0j0i10k1l2j0l4.1584629.1600332.0.1601915.6.5.1.0.0.0.137.363.0j3.4.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..1.5.496.6..35i39k1j0i131k1j0i131i67k1.125.omb_Xhi2eH4][War Games]] was real. Unlike in the movie, those involved didn't make it to NORAD in time, and the US launched all its missiles against their targets.

In our world, the 5.4 km large asteroid 4179 Toutatis passed [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_asteroid_close_approaches_to_Earth#Objects_%3E_50_meters][the Earth in a distance of 6.9 million km on December 12 2012]], which is extremely close in astronomical scale. In this world, it collided with the Earth, setting off destructions and mass extinctions unseen since a 10 km large asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago.

** This isn't quite what you asked for -- the magical world definitely notices, but the ministry refuses to take it seriously until it is too late:
