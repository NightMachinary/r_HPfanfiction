Does anyone know of any fics where Aberforth Dumbledore plays a prominent role? I've been reading through Patron recently and I'm intrigued by the character presented, one with lots of connections to operatives of various kinds on the shadier side of things, and intense loyalty to them and the sacrifices they've made in previous wars. Perhaps where albus dies early on and he feels compelled to step up and fight voldemort?

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

This is a nifty character piece told in a collection of encounters between Aberforth Dumbledore and Sirius Black during the first rise of Voldemort.
