Could have been Daphne Greengrass also, though I don't think it was. Anyway, it's a post-war story and her father wanted to sell her off to Lucius Malfoy who was on the look out for a virgin for some shady ritual, but now that I wrote that line I guess I could be mixing it up with something else because that's insane.


** At my first glance at the title of this fic search, I thought it was 'pureblood girl fled home and became an animagus to hide from forced marriage'.

** Maybe one of the girls in A Black Comedy? Sorry, I don't remember all the details of that story but I remember there was a running gag about strange things happening to the girls they help out.

*** I don't think that's the one. In that fic the running gag was that Harry and Sirius kept bedding women that were connected to each other in one way or another; it started with Harry being with Susan while Sirius got with Amelia, and then from there it got increasingly silly.

** It's Daphne Greengrass. I've read it before but I guess it's taken down now. I dinstictly remember reading that Harry took down Voldemort by divebombing him on his Firebolt.

*** Okay I was extremely bored. I know the time of last update, and now HP/DG thanks to you. Added a word count filter, and found it without much difficulty. It's called [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/9246516/1][Someone to Love]], so I was wrong about the name. And btw, you were right about the divebombing thing.

*** Ah that's a pity. Normally I archive links of what I read, and deleted stuffs can still be found at fictionhunt provided there is a ff.net id, but I lost my files for a period around 2015. Only other thing I can recall is that it had a one word name.

  AU Start to Sixth Year. What do you do to stop a genocidal dark wizard? Try appeasement. If it sinks your entire economy, well... That just makes things more interesting.
