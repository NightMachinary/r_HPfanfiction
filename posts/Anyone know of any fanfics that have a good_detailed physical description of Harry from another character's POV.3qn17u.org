The bad part about reading the series in Harry's point of view is that we don't always get the best descriptions of his outer appearance besides black hair, glasses, worn-out clothes, etc. or his mannerisms/reactions to things from another character's point of view.


** The mannerisms part, yes. [[http://www.letterblade.net/thirty-five_owls.html][Thirty Five Owls]] by Letterblade. This is part of a letter which Dumbledore writes to his old friend Grindelwald.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter started at Hogwarts five years ago. He was Sorted into Gryffindor House, which I doubt surprises you. His academics are on the upper side of average, his teacher relations generally neutral, and his friendships unbreakable as diamonds. He was raised by an abusive, neglectful Muggle family, utterly miserable until he came to Hogwarts, and that was my will, for it was necessary to protect him. Necessary to condemn him to a horrible childhood. His entire life is bound up in old magic, wild philomency, things Voldemort refuses to acknowledge and which even you and I barely plumbed the existence of. He is both ordinary and extraordinary at once, and it strains my wit to describe him.

  He has suffered so, so much for a boy so young. And so much of it at my hands, even if indirectly. And--he does not know. He has not even the faintest clue of the true weight of it.

  His fate is entwined with Voldemort's. Magic beyond logic or reason--

  Gellert, I must send him to his death.

  I had tried for so many years not to see it. A shred of Voldemort's soul, so torn from the creation of his Horcruxes, dislodged when the Killing Curse backfired and stuck in an innocent boy. There is a prophecy. Twin serpents in the smoke of the pathfinder. Old, old, antediluvian magic--

  I cannot tell him. How could I? He must realize it himself--

  He is a good boy, Gellert. He is tough and brave and mostly clever, and he deserves better. He deserves to grow up and grow old and fall in love and herd about children and write crochety letters. He deserves to bury Voldemort and move on to his own life, free of fates and scars and nonsense, and I would give /my/ life to make it so, but I cannot, not ever, because that is not how things are.

Also look up linkffn(An Interview with JustinFinchFletchley). It has plenty of discussion about Harry.

  Ten years after the defeat of Voldemort, Lee Jordan asks what life was like during the Death-Eaters' reign for the Muggleborn son of a prominent Tory family, and what he learned as a member of the commission which investigated how they came to power.

*** This is really good!!! I would love to read more of this, except........... some inconsistancies with canon - unless it does that on purpose of course. (because at this point Dumbledore knew Harry would survive)

Also, and I know this is fan fiction, but I hate the idea of Dumbledore putting Harry at the Dursleys /in order/ for Harry to turn into the "right sort of person". A) realistically, it wouldn't have worked, Harry's personality is highly unusual to come from a home like the Dursleys, and I just have trouble believeing that someone as logical as Dumbledore would think that could possibly work. And B) Dumbledore didn't know yet what sort of role Harry would play when he placed him at the Dursleys. Dumbledore does not know everything right away, he is a complicated character who learned a lot throughout the series and changes his mind based on new information nearly ever year.

Anyway, I know this is fan fiction, so it doesn't have to be canon, but just some things I've noticed often enough in fan fiction that I think a lot of people think it's canon.

#+end_quote

Dumbledore didn't know for sure that Harry would survive. There was an even chance that he would, but it wasn't anything more than an educated guess on Dumbledore's part. He admits as much in DH. And that is addressed in the fic:

#+begin_quote
  Oh, but there is a chance! a faint glimmer of a chance that he might just survive. That Harry might live--damaged, no doubt, shell-shocked as the Muggles would say, but alive.

  But sometimes hope is more painful than surrender.

But that's the point, it's done on purpose so you can immerse yourself better.

*** Yeah, actually, it does it sooo well, I would say! It's something I've noticed even more writing my own fan fiction. I'm trying to write it in a similar way as JKR, and I've actually realized how /little/ she actually says sometimes, but the words she uses still show us exactly what's going on and at the same time allowing us to place ourselves into the story and be mad or annoyed /for/ Harry and /feel it/ instead of read it. For example, the gossip article about Hermione breaking Harry's heart for Krum in GoF - we never get Harry's opinion on this. All we know about it is that he goes red when Snape reads the article in class, but JKR never has him say or think his actual opinion about the article. But... we still /know/ what he thinks about it anyway. We don't need to be /told/.

Anyway, yeah, I totally agree, it's the point, and I think one of the reasons the books became so popular, because the writing style allowed us to feel more and therefore relate more.
