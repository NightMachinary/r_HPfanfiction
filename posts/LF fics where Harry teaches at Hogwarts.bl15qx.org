:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for some quality fanfic where Harry becomes a professor at Hogwarts. Not looking for romance.

Also looking for a specific fic where Harry comes back as the/a (the History of Magic?) professor. He has his students reenact battles. He was also disabled during the war, so I believe Dobby needs to help him with his leg braces.


** I think two good ones are Wind Shear by Chilord and Disorder of the Phoenix by Jacobapples. Both of those he ends up professor and does a pretty good job.

** Linkffn(11160991) features Harry as the (surprisingly to him) competent Divination Professor after being dragged to a Girl-Who-Lived AU, post-OotP. Sadly hasn't been updated in a while.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP
