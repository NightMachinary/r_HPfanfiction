I just got done reading linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them), and I loved it. I want to know if y'all have any reccomendations for other stories like that: fics with heavy fantasy elements, interesting conceptions of magic, but that don't take themselves too seriously.


** try The Book of Dobby by Doghead13. It's got some very original stuff in it, some of it very funny, at least to me..

His elven counting system is one of the better off the wall bits I've read.

  There's only so far you can push anyone before they'll push back, and Harry's been pushed too far. Between that and Dobby's form of mad proving contagious, things are about to get violent. ABANDONED.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

** If you don't mind good fics that have been sadly abandoned, linkffn(Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone) is a pretty good take on a goblin-raised Harry. Although not nearly as humorous as /Fantastic Elves/, it has its moments.

  Following the fall of Voldemort, it is up to the Gringotts goblins to carry out the terms of the Potters' will. What will happen when young Harry Potter - halfblood, Parselmouth, curse-scarred, outsider - is raised in the stalagmite city of Underfoot?
