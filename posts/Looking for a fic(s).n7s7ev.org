Cant remember anything about them except for they create portable floos,pretty sure they look light lighters(maybe, and they were also able to use it as a mailing system Another(or the same one) has hogwarts students going to the movies a lot(especially the slytherins)

also just looking for fics were magical versions of muggle things are made and/or muggle ideas are implemented in hogwarts

****** You can find stories where someone comes up with a magical way to watch TV or movies at Hogwarts in a bunch of fics. Off the top of my head, I know Burnable's story linked below did that, RobSt did it at least once or twice, Tigerman's Runemaster, etc.

#+begin_quote
  Harry finds himself thrust into his four-year old body, after Voldemort killed him in the forest in what would have been his seventh year. Knowing what he did, he decided to fix some things he never had a chance to before. He'd not go into the magical world untrained this time. OP Harry. Science, magic and discovery. Harem.

  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.
