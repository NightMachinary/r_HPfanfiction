I've been thinking about a Tom Riddle/Hermione fic I read a few months ago.

Here's what I remember about it:

I'm pretty sure it's Riddle AU.

Probably completed, I hardly read incomplete fics.

At one point, Ron (I think it's Ron, Idk) is complaining about Tom trying to show off with a simple flame charm and Hermione points out that Tom has been playing with fiendfyre throughout their whole conversation.

Something happens and Tom gets pissed off and levels about twenty trees in the Black Forest.

They're looking for Grindelwald in the Black Forest. Maybe to get back to their own time. I'm not sure.

I want to say Draco Malfoy is involved and terrified the whole time.

If you help me find it I'll really appreciate it!


** Maybe Pygmalion? The fiendfyre thing happens in that one, though I'm pretty sure it wasn't Ron.

*** It was Draco and Theo, I believe. What a great story that is.
