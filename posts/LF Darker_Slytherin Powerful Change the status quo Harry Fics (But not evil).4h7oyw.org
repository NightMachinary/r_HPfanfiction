I posted something similar to this a while back and got surprisingly few results. However at that time I was only looking for Fics where Harry is a leader in Slytherin house against Voldemort and perhaps that was limiting my pool. As usual, I am open to any suggestions, but here is more detail on what I am looking for.

I am looking for Fics where Harry is very powerful (He can be godlike, or simply magically powerful with political clout... i dont care).

I want ones where he does not follow the traditional "light" path but strays into the dark as well, and blazes his own path. He must get rid of Voldemort, but hopefully the Fic takes the story beyond that and he goes about changing the magical world and maybe beyond. However he is NOT the next dark lord or truly evil, but does do what is necessary to accomplish his goals.

I would also like romance in it if possible (preferably more mature oriented.. as I hate the kiddy glove stuff). Lemon/Smut is fine. Harems/Covens Fine. F/M only please... no slash.


** I remember you posting this request a few days ago.

I think you will like this one:

*Emperor*, linkffn(5904185), this Harry could cast wandless/non-verbal fiendfyre, commanded thousands of military wizards and millions of muggle soldiers, and had a genius scientist girlfriend/wife churning out super weapons for his armies. He would be best characterized as a ruthless, but also benevolent dictator.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

*** Ive actually read Emperor before. While I enjoyed it, its a bit too AU for my tastes. I do not reject AU (or crossovers), but for the most part I prefer it when they are borderline, and not full out in nature. A good example of the style of Crossover or AU that I enjoyed would be something like say.... "Broken Chains", by Darth Mars.

**** Honestly, I'm not sure. Most of the slytherin/darker!HP fics I've come across feature either Harry/Draco or Harry/Voldemort (especially the latter). I honestly don't think I've ever come across one with a het pairing (I read het too, btw). Heck, I can't even think of one that was gen. :/

***** I wonder why. Surely he can go Slytherin/darker and be paired with a female character. Even if you discount the idea that Hermione, Luna, Ginny, or whoever "ligher" side or "other house" character would match up with him, there are several slytherin pairings that could work (Like the Greengrass girls, or Davis, or even Parkinson), or even OC's.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Slytherin Selection) and the sequels. The first one is not very dark because it's during Harry's first year, but the sequels get darker.

  (1/7) At Madam Malkin's, Harry Potter introduces himself to Draco Malfoy. Draco offers to help Harry navigate the bizarre, new wizarding world, and Harry accepts. While Harry finds magic to be strange and amazing, there is no class to teach Harry about the complexities of friendship and social life in Slytherin... AU, Slytherin!Harry.

*** I am not sure if it was you who posted this on my last request thread, but If memory serves me I tried to read the first one and was bored to be honest. Plus I am not a fan of FF where Harry and Draco are buddies or partners or whatever. I would rather Harry take control of Slytherin and Draco be forced down or out. Not opposed to it, its just not my favorite thing as I have always hated Draco as a character due to his blind ignoran

However you mention the sequels get darker so maybe I should take another look.

**** I would recommend reading it further due to the fact that it gets sooo much better, especially in exploring Harry's flaws, he is constantly fucking up and it's great. The author also has great characterization, and who said Harry and Draco would be friends forever, but if you want a harry that is a lot more active in Slytherin hierarchy then linkffn(11191235) is the story for you.

  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.
