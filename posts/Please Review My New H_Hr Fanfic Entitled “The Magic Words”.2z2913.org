Hello. As the title states I'd really appreciate your help. Earlier this week I started writing an H/Hr story, but I haven't received a lot of feedback yet. Let me tell you a little bit about my idea.

Often times in HP fanfics, there are several “magic” words that immediately destroy all conflict from any story. You know the ones. Dobby. Gringotts. Prophecy.

As soon as the protagonist calls on a house elf, a single snap of their tiny fingers fixes almost any problem. Gringotts usually ends up supplying Harry & Co. with lore-breaking plot devices, exorbitant wealth, and respect they haven't earned. OOtP's prophecy renders anything said after it to be completely moot. Of course Harry's going to win after an endorsement from fate itself.

My original idea was to lampoon these awful ideas in a parody fic approximately 10k words in length. While rereading *Chamber of Secrets* for background research, though, I had a much better idea after seeing this passage:

/[Harry] dreamed that he was on show in a zoo, with a card reading UNDERAGE WIZARD attached to his cage. People goggled through the bars at him as he lay, starving and weak, on a bed of straw. He saw Dobby's face in the crowd and shouted out, asking for help, but Dobby called, “Harry Potter is safe there, sir!” and vanished. Then the Dursleys appeared and Dudley rattled the bars of the cage, laughing at him./

The current iteration of *The Magic Words* was primarily inspired by two classic works of literature (Golding's *Lord of the Flies* and Defoe's *Robinson Crusoe*) and the aforementioned awful tropes of Harry Potter fanfiction. If you haven't read either of those, I'm going to spoil them for you now. In the final scene of Golding's book, the castaway schoolboys -- now lawless savages ruled almost entirely by their baser instincts -- are finally rescued by a passing ship. Upon seeing the adult crew members they immediately break down crying for their lost innocence. Defoe's Crusoe spends twenty-eight years on a small island learning to fend for himself and eventually finds a way back to Europe where he retires wealthy and famous after his adventure.

I thought both of those endings were unsatisfyingly inaccurate and I wondered how a brave little boy like Harry Potter might react if he were in a similar situation. Given my shipping preferences I decided Hermione should make the trip as well. In contrast to the vast majority of stories involving those two I'd like to assume they aren't already madly in love at the tender age of twelve and let any romance evolve gradually from a foundation of heartfelt friendship.

Anyway, I hope you don't mind giving my story a shot. Hopefully it's different enough to make you take it under advisement. It's currently 19k words and will likely end up clocking in at around 80-90k. I want to eventually average around 2-3 chapters a week once the initial euphoria of first-time authorship wears off.

Even if you're a Severitus fan who can't imagine Harry paired with anyone other than Draco, feel free to leave a review anyway. Feedback is always appreciated.

The Summary: 2nd Year AU Exile Fic. Stranded in a mysterious new location and with no one to turn to, Harry and Hermione must make their own way in an unfamiliar environment armed with only their wits and a desperate desire to survive. Snape hatches plots, Ron gets lonely and Gringotts complicates everything. Eventual H/Hr. No bashing.

My [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?p=806679#post806679][DLP's WbA]]. Apologies in advance for the bizarre formatting on the forum if you choose to read it there. Unfortunately the controls for posting there aren't very intuitive. Or (more likely) I'm just being simple minded.

Edit: I've reworked several portions based on excellent feedback from ff.net reviews and the DLP forums: Eliminated hints of Hermione's early non-platonic feelings for Harry (this will still be H/Hr but not until much later), altered foreshadowing indicating Dumbledore's impending departure (no longer planned) due to age-related dementia (also removed), and fixed a big goof regarding Luna and Ginny's presence in the carriage with Neville. Thanks to supernlp at ff.net and Garden at DLP for their assistance.

I'm overwhelmed by the responses so far and am very grateful for everyone who's stopped by to add their perspectives. Thanks!


** Not sure why you're not getting more attention yet. Will review in detail when I have the time. Short version: good stuff. Keep it up.

No; DLP doesn't have any good way of posting stuff there easily yet. We [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=28446][had a thread recently]] about the ridiculous workarounds people go to to get stuff looking right. It's an issue being worked on!

**** I posted something in WbA a little while ago and spent a very very long time on the formatting. If you're using chrome, switch to another browser and you can paste to preserve formatting... in theory. In practice, I had to just manually add in all the italics because the line spacings were awful on firefox and I couldn't bring myself to open IE. :(

Seriously. I have to add spaces after each paragraph break even after I'd already done it while composing. Very strange, but it's alright. Is it against etiquette to just include a link to the ff.net page?

****** Yes, and it's understandable - it's quite annoying to try and quote things and such if the only link is FF.net, which we frequently do to point out paragraphs that are good or have an issue that needs correcting. That's the main reason, the rest is politeness. Raven's looking into being able to convert documents, but I don't know if it can really be done.

** I'Ll admit I'm too lazy to review every chapter (and should probably shamed for it lol) but since you did make some changes I'd recommended and you're here on reddit I might make an exception. It looks really good so far and seeing the insperation for it makes it much better.

*** Ron will stay likeable. No bashing in my story, and that is reflected in the most recent update. The good folks at DLP have been helping me make a better story and as a result of their advice I'm striving to keep Ron relevant.

The problem with doing that is Ron's presence in the early books is almost entirely defined by his friendship with Harry. Now on his own I can promise that he'll have his own point of view.

**** yeah i just really like the trio dynamic. they are the OTP of the series. I'm usually netural to most pairings but as long as the story maintains the integrity of the trio i'm usually game.
