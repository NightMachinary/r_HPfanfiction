Give me any and all fics with great worldbuilding, they make an island and build stuff on it? Link it, there's some cool small things in the fic? Link it. You guys get it, I hope

Thanks


** Linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution) has a lot of fighting in magical France, Germany, Bulgaria, Poland and Russia. The author largely keeps the same worldbuilding across fics so in Lady Thief you might hear of someone using being from Portland as a cover story since there's currently a civil war there and nobody can check, and years later in Granger Principle, a complete different fic, you have the main characters visiting the half-destroyed magical alley there. It's a really fascinating world with fleshed out politics and history across many countries.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

**** If you like it and read the entire Starfox5-verse, it's over 2.5 million words. All worth it.

** I'm currently writing a fic, and my co-author and I are /obsessed/ with worldbuilding. Lots of magical theory & new people and places.

As for whether it qualifies as "amazing" or not, you'd have to be the judge.

** Victoria Potter: linkao3(13795605)

This fic has a huge amount of work put into the details and worldbuilding on basically all fronts.\\
[[/u/Taure]], the author, has made spreadsheets (which they link to on their AO3 profile) on the main character's finances and school schedule. There's also a guide to women's robes and a map of the Hogwarts grounds/Hogsmeade. There /was/ also a document that went into detail about how magic works, but that's been taken offline for revisions.

There's also The Accidental Animagus: linkao3(14078862)

Accidental Animagus goes into large amounts of details around what's happening politically, and there's a sister-fic that shows snippets of what's going on internationally.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First year complete as of Chapter 12.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.
