He offers McGonagall one in the opening chapter of Philospher's Stone, and "Sherbet Lemon" is the password to his office in a later book. To my knowledge those are the only times they are mentioned.

Why is it that in every other fic, there is a scene where someone is in Dumbledore's office and he offers them a lemon drop? It is baffling to me.


** I thought he always seemed to have a bowl of them in his office, but that of course could be from fanfiction and canon blurring lines.

Anyways, you know how fanfiction can go, we find something miniscule and use to to base an entire plot off of. Mrs. Weasley jokes about making a love potion as a Hogwarts student? Bam! She's this evil potions mistress who captured Arthur and plans on getting Harry and Ginny together!

Though lemon drops is a bit more benign than the above example

*** Mostly benign, except for the stores where Dumbledore laces the drops with some dasterdly potion, maybe to make people more suggestible during his manipulations. I've come across that in at least 2 separate fics.

**** There's also the more benign version, where they're laced with calming potion.

I cannot say how much I HATE how people use that to justify Weasley-bashing.

  but they also have more innocent applications

I'm struggling to think of an innocent use for what is essentially a drug that forces you to be attracted to someone.

*** Since lemon drops are benign, they spread more easily to a wider range of fics. It's also a thing you can insert into a fic without changing the plot.

** First impressions mean a lot, and the first time we see Dumbledore he appears as this very wizardly wizard who offers McGonagall a lemon drop and says that someone recently introduced them to him.

We can gather the offer was a way to calm McGonagall down as she was rather stressed out. Combine that with the fact that he elaborated on the subject a little more than just a simple offer and you get a powerful first impression of a grampa who offers candy during tense times to help people calm down a bit.

If the books are anything to go by, Harry Potter's life is full of tense times.

** I always felt like it just exemplified Dumbledore's love of simplistic, child-like things, which is actually in stark contrast to his high intelligent, slightly morally ambiguous inner-self. Most fanfic just isn't good at embracing subtlety.

** The opening scene features five references to lemon drops, so it's beaten over your head every time you start to reread. There's another reference in Chamber of Secrets, near the end of chapter 11, just in case you forget after the first book -- another password.

Honestly, that just brings up another question: why does the headmaster's office have a password on it in the first place? He's supposed to help students out, and you can't do that if they can't reach you when they're in trouble.

*** It can safely be assumed Rowling never thought of that, as she never presented it as an issue throughout her books.

I think it just adds to the "wise wizard" image she was going for.

As I love to say, /Harry Potter is symbolic and imprecise by nature./

*** Sure, he references sherbet lemons/lemon drops in the opening chapter, but there is literally no indication that he offers them to anyone else after that chapter, which, bear in mind, takes place 11 years before the rest of the book. I just don't understand where the idea that he has a bowl of sherbet lemons in his office at all times and will offer them to anyone for any reason comes from.

**** I'm not saying that Rowling imagined Dumbledore as being obsessed with lemon drops. I'm not saying the text supports that. I'm saying that, given the text, it's not too surprising that fandom has become this obsessed with lemon drops.
