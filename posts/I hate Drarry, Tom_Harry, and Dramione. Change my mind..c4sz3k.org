#+begin_quote
  AU/Crossover. Stargate-centric.Harry pays a high price when driving Voldemort from his mind at the Ministry battle; he burns out his magical abilities entirely. Now without magic, he is summarily rejected from wizarding society but comes to realise he has gained something ... other ... or Ancient.Starting a new life from scratch in the non-magical world, his natural skills and love of flying draw him to join the Royal Air Force, and from there to the SAS. Now 24, Harry has distinguished himself as an exemplary soldier, decorated for acts above and beyond the call of duty. The last eight years have been turbulent, and often traumatic. Wounded in action multiple times, and haunted by the memory of a close friend and lover whom he couldn't save, he has endured events that would have broken lesser men; perhaps it is time to let others shoulder the burden.And then, in June 2004, under a mountain in Colorado, everything changes. An expedition is departing into the unknown; they will only take the best. Harry's new powers identify him as a carrier of the ATA gene - the strongest found yet. And in another galaxy, he will find new reasons to fight; amongst the stars he will find a new family, home, and love.

** linkao3(879852) is one of my favorite Drarry's. I don't want to discuss the events of the story, because spoilers, but I really enjoyed the universe that the author creates. Everything is expertly woven together and the few OCs that are introduced have great characterization.

There are very nice flaws given to each character. Details are revealed as Harry discovers them - it's a gorgeous and well-done way of explaining the differences in characterization and I love how the story unfolds. This piece is really just a journey of self-discovery with slash tossed in.

** Well, I dislike slash, but I've read several interesting gender change AU fics with Tom/Harry. (in fact f!HP/TR and HP/f!TR are my OTPs)

!linkao3(The Historical Importance of Runic War Warding)

This is a fem!Harry/Voldemort fic that explores an interesting interpretation of Harry being a horcrux and the implications that it holds.

!linkffn(Thunderstorm)

Harry/fem!diary!Riddle. Harry is four years older than canon. This is a short fic, but it's generally considered the most palatable Harry/Tom fic for a wider audience.

!linkffn(Power is Control) Harry/fem!Voldemort. I love this one, though it's definitely not for everyone. Voldemort is drawn to Harry by the horcrux in his scar, and Harry realises that, he can leverage himself to try and reign in her worst impulses. The story takes some interesting turns.

!linkffn(When Harry met Tom)

Fem!Harry/Tom. Harry ends up in the past due to a mishap in the DoM battle in fifth year. She just wants to get back to the future, but Tom Riddle finds her fascinating, since, unlike every other Slytherin, she doesn't care what anyone thinks about her, and it makes him reconsider if his goal of becoming Lord Voldemort is actually something he /wants/.

linkffn(The Advantages of Being Sane)

Harry/fem!Voldemort. Voldemort had her sanity restored by taking a killing curse to the face, and after her resurrection, she wants to work together with Harry and Cedric to destroy all of the death eaters to remove their plague on society.

!linkffn(Departure from the Diary)

(apologies for self-promotion). Harry/fem!diary!Riddle. Tamelyn finds the horcrux in Harry's scar in the chamber of secrets at the end of second year, and decides that using it as a conduit to possess him would be a lot more efficient and a lot less damning than absorbing Ginny's soul and killing the only witness. Unfortunately for her, Lily's protection is still active, leaving her stuck inside Harry's head. She wants to get out as much as Harry wants her out, so they come to an uneasy truce.

#+begin_quote
  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.

** Tom/Harry: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14527497/chapters/33565593][The Philosopher King]] by RedHorse. Very AU, and what I find especially compelling about this story is the worldbuilding (Voldemort won, dominated the muggles under wizarding rule, and the wizards under his rule, and while monstrous, he's also low-key concerned about fixing climate change.

It's in progress, but still updating semi-regularly.

  Tom Riddle received a thorough education in magic, cultivated an influential following, and secured his immortality. He then disappeared into the Muggle world and was quickly convinced that, left unchecked, Muggles were certain to doom the entire planet. Tom returned a decade later with a careful strategy for world dominion. He succeeded. By the time a young Harry Potter, Heir to his Name and ward of the Malfoy family, is handed a wand at the traditional age of eight, he stands to inherit a modest territory of 25,000 square kilometers and eight thousand restless Muggle subjects.

  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.

** Drarry

Away Childish Things linkao3(16052816) Harry (and later Draco) gets deaged. I dare you to find a fic that explores impact of Harry's and Draco's upbringing on them better.

Also later parts of The secret language of plants linkao3(9323225), all-around fantastic fic.

Tom/Harry

love is touching souls (surely you touched mine) linkao3(5937535), time travel

Snake Eyes linkao3(13279185) pre-slash with Tom born in Harry's time, can be read as a friendship fic

Dramione... Not my pairing at all, but On the Perils of Free Advice linkao3(243530) is pretty funny and cute. Draco is working as a sex-advice columnist, but he's a virgin and doesn't actually know anything about sex

Edit: People who are downvoting this (and other) comment, at least tell me why. Because I'm pretty sure you haven't read any of these fics, and just downvoted because of the pairings, /in a post that specifically requested these pairings/. That's pathetic.

  “Just... tell me.

Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

  Draco's stuck working as a sex-advice columnist after the Ministry impounded both his family's money and Malfoy Manor. He traded on his sex god reputation at Hogwarts in order to get the job, but there are a few small problems: he's a virgin, and he also has no idea what he's talking about.When Hermione Granger arrives at his office, irate at the poor quality of his advice, Draco finds himself blackmailed into letting her instruct him on the proper way to give sex advice. She apparently gets up to some pretty creative sexual practices in her spare time, but she's also an irritating, intrusive know-it-all. Draco should be chomping at the bit to get rid of her, so why is he fantasizing about her all the time?

** linkffn(Butterfly Heart by The Fictionist) is a very well-written Tom/Harry. It's inspired by Silence of the Lambs, and as far as serial killer AUs go, this is one of my favourites. Going into this, you're....you're not supposed to like the ship. It's /supposed/ to be messed up, and that's what I find so fascinating about this. But that's just me spending way too much time on my major, so idk. It's a good read, and it makes you want more, similar, content once you're finished. One of the few fics I reread every few months. It's complete and on Ao3 if that's your preferred site.

** Draco/Harry

Secrets, by Vorabiza. My go-to fic for Draco/Harry since... way, way way to many years ago. linkao3(8184311) - it does have a child in it, who is a main character, but it's not graphic childbirth or anything.

** Love in a time of the zombie apocalypse by Rizzle. In fact, any of Rizzle's works really. She doesn't shy away from evil Malfoy but redeems him without excusing his actions.
