Looking for a bit of an OOC Harry who is capable of supporting Cho in her grief and guilt. Don't mind if it's romance or not.


** This is just a oneshot but I liked the alternate spin of their Hogsmeade date:

  One shot. Harry's Valentine's Day date with Cho goes a little better.

***** It's almost too in character. The author really has a feel of hp relationship cringe.

****** I know what you mean. They handle that conversation very realistically.

I really enjoy White Squirrel's works! I'd recommend them.

** There is a fanfic called Harry Potter and the Autumn Swan where they actually date. The author made one crazy change I wasn't keen about, but it's a good story. It's unfortunately abandoned.
