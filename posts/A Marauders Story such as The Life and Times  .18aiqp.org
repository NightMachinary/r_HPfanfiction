I'm looking for a story centered around James and Lily, and the other Marauders, such as The Life and Times. Sadly, Miss Jewel hasn't updated her majestic epic in quite awhile. Any other great fanficts out there to hold me over? To help, here's a little [[http://imgur.com/OiLroiA][inspiration.]]

** I almost hate to tell you to read this fic, because it's also a work in progress and the author updates as rarely as Miss Jewel does. Still, it's just as riveting, and a thoroughly delightful read. Although it's Remus/OC-centered, the James and Lily story is there and there's lots of Marauder action so it doesn't really feel like a Remus-fic, it just feels like a Marauder fic told from Remus' perspective. Both it and Life and Times are my two current obsessions.

At the very least, she's got over 60 chapters up, so that should tide you over for awhile until Miss Jewel updates again. It's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2598097/1/Moments-of-Bliss][Moments of Bliss]] on fanfiction.net, and [[http://www.fanfiction.mugglenet.com/viewstory.php?sid=24240][here's the story on mugglenet]].

*** Thanks, I will defiantly give it a read. I personally am enthralled with The Marauders, their misadventures, stories, life, and the beginning of the war. I wish J. K. would write a prequel set in The Marauder era.

**** She actually has. The Harry Potter Prequel was written for charity, and it's not as long as I'd wish it be (around 800 words), but is a fantastic and humorous fic about James and Sirius when they are about 19.

** Is it still only at chapter 35? I literally just got to that point and I was going to post on here asking if anyone knew what was going on with it.Was it abandoned? Does she always take this long to update?

*** I'm honestly not sure, I hope she hasn't left it for the dust to gather.
