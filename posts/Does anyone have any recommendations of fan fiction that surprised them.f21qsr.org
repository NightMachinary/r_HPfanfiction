Now, I enjoy time travel. I do not enjoy over bashing, although just a tad is fine. I also enjoy strange ideas, not as much strange pairings (the ‘strangest' I've ever read is probably Fremione but they weren't the main focus of the story anyways). I really enjoy stories where Harry kind of ‘transforms' into a stronger, better version of himself, after all the badgering from the Dursley's and dark lords under turbans funny business.


** The go to "what the fuck am I reading, why is this so good, wtf wtf wtf" fic is linkao3(Harry Potter and the Lack of Lamb Sauce) It's about what would happen if Gordon Ramsey is the potions master instead of Slughorn in book 6. It's long, ridiculously good, and will destroy your emotions, while also involving GORDON RAMSEY AND ALL THE SHIT THAT COMES WITH HIM. It's not particularly focused on Harry though, more of an ensemble, and has a great take on Ron.

If you like time travel, I'd suggests linkao3(of a linear circle)

  Inspired by a post on Tumblr, this is a AU story set during Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts, with one big, foul-mouthed difference. Instead of Horace Slughorn, the position of Potions professor will be taken on by...Gordon Ramsay.
