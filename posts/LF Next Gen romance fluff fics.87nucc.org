Not the angsty fluff where one of them is like, /oh, but my parents hate your dad, we can't ever never ever smever be together/, but the fics where they're just kids dealing with crushes, life and stuff like that. But with a bit more focus on romance than life. For example, I just read a fic where Hermione's daughter has a crush on Paxton Wood, and there's a lot of blushing and awkwardness and stuttering, but eventually, we find out that Paxton likes Hermione's daughter too. Which was the fic that inspired this request.


** Linkffn(4828161) is pretty good
