** Two for you:

‚Äã

Both of these are completed so not the one you're looking for. But still very very good and worth the read

  In an alternate universe where Sirius Black never went to Azkaban, Harry divides his life between the Dursleys' house and Mr. Black's bookshop -- until Sirius realises what the Dursleys are doing to him, and takes him away from their care.

** linkffn (5411398)

AU where Harry isn't found until he's 14. Remus takes him in. This one is my favorite Remus raising Harry fic!

Edit: My bad, I still haven't figured out how to make the fanfic bot work.

*** For the bot, delete the space between ffn and the bracket. (( linkffn() )). It should work then üòä.

If you edit your post then comment on it with ffnbot!refresh it should come up... That's what you do if the bot doesn't work the first time or links the wrong story üòä

Hope that helps üòä

  At age ten, Harry disappeared. Four years later, a suspiciously familiar boy is found. Remus accepts the task of reintroducing him to the wizarding world, Harry resisting all the while. Between meddlesome ministers and mad escaped convicts, Remus attempts to discover the truth. Where has Harry been? Will he ever learn to trust? Includes child abuse

** There is this AU where harry isn't the BWL because his parents were the ones attacked by Bellatrix and co and Neville is the child of the prophecy, Remus raises him because Sirius is incarcerated and the plot is pretty good as well but its incomplete.

  AU. Harry is two years older than canon and raised by Remus. Neville is BWL. Story of Harry's search for knowledge to cure his mother. Snarky characters, witty humor, Quidditch, deeply developed OCs. Harry/Fleur.

  What if Sirius didn't spend twelve years in prison, but was given a trial after four years? Follow the story of Sirius Black as he learns what it means to be a father/brother/guardian to his young godson & the story of Harry Potter, a young boy with a loving home who learns about the Marauders from the two men who should have raised him. Slow-burn Hinny. M for sex & violence.

  ‚ÄúJust... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.‚ÄùWhat was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.
