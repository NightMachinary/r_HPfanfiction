I think we can all agree that /Harry Potter and the Cursed Child/ is bad worldbuilding. Changing the rules of time turners alone does that.

/But/ put yourselves in the shoes of someone who hasn't read fan fiction, or at least hasn't read much fan fiction. I think it's plausible or even probable that the writers haven't. How bad was the actual writing?

(I would also add that it's theater, which is a completely different medium, and they only have maybe 50,000 words to work with.)

There are definite characterization problems, as many people have mentioned, especially with Harry and Ron. And I've argued that the entire fourth act was unnecessary, and the play would have been better without it. But I would also argue that the tired, old tropes aren't that tired and old to a non-fanfic reader. At least, I didn't think they were when I first started reading fanfic.

No, I didn't think the script was great, but I don't think Amazon's current 3.5 star rating is massively too high, either. It's where the play butts heads with the books that it causes problems.


** There was a serious lack of subtley, specifically with the Dumbledore portraits scenes that I had mixed feelings about - they validated precisely my feelings about Dumbledore to such an exactness I felt like those scenes were written specifically to help me prove my points better - but they were also horribly written and way too direct - plus I don't think Harry and Dumbledore would need to say those things to each other, because I feel that Harry has seen exactly what Dumbledore is, forgives and accepts him, and they are such different people, I do not think Harry would be blinded by love in the same way Dumbledore was. But I think on stage it may play off more subtle and maybe is less cringe-worthy? Perhaps the stage demands more directness...?

I think it's clear the writers haven't read fan fiction at all and therefore do not realize they are copying tropes we've all grown tired of.

**** Every time I try to tell people that the script worked well on stage I get down voted. It's a completely different way of writing. You can't do subtle on stage as the majority of the audience is too high up to make out facial expressions and it's a completely different tone of voice used. Wish those Â£1 binoculars had been omnioculars.

** I don't think you have to actively see these tropes to hate them, honestly. I mean, is there anyone that actually likes Delphi? What reason is there to like her? Her story isn't interesting, her personality is as bland as they come and when she has silverish hair and is the temporary love interest of Albus, it's rather hard to take her seriously.

*** Silver hair with blue IIRC.

She didn't have to be Voldemort's daughter. She could have been the daughter of any Death Eater or a fanatic for whatever reason. Or even the daughter of Bellatrix and Rodolphus. But making her Voldemort's secret daughter with silver and blue hair who can fly and is a Parselmouth... It's just a lot. Too much. She's actually my biggest issue with the story and I'd find it more palatable (time travel and all) if she wasn't so overdone and fanfiction OC

**** It's still possible that Delphi actually /isn't/ Voldemort's daughter, but only believes that she is.

Recently, with "A History of Magic in North America" on Pottermore, J.K. Rowling wrote that the Gaunt family had at least one other branch, namely, in Ireland. Rionach Gaunt, a Pureblood witch and descendant of Salazar Slytherin, married the Pureblood wizard William Sayre in the late 1500's/early 1600's. Her daughter, Isolt Sayre, came to America.

Isolt Sayre founded Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. However, being a descendant of Slytherin, it's heavily implied she could speak Parseltongue. Her "house" at Ilvermorny, Horned Serpent, was named after a [likely basilisk relative] she "could speak with and understand".

Isolt had two daughters with her Muggle husband, James Steward: Martha, a Squib, and Rionach II, a witch.

Rionach II never married "in an effort to eradicate Slytherin's bloodline". However, her sister, Martha, /did/ marry a Native American man from a local tribe.

In another interview, Rowling pointedly confirmed that Muggle-borns "are a result of Squibs intermarrying with Muggles, and magic showing up in the descendants of these unions several generations later".

Due to this, it's entirely possible that Delphi is actually the long-lost descendant of Martha Steward, and thus, the other branch of the Gaunt family. She merely assumes she's Lord Voldemort's daughter because she can speak Parseltongue.

If this is the case, Delphi would also likely be Muggle-born, or, at best, Half-blood.

****** Thank you! I definitely think it would bring some much-needed character development to Delphi as well. It would also provide an interesting arc about Delphi finding out that she is /not/ Voldemort's daughter, and, perhaps, her quest to "rediscover who she truly is"; "finding out what truly happened to her birth family and parents"; and to "find her true purpose in life". She could also be redeemed through this, as her main motivation in the play is her seeking out love, acceptance, and affection from a parental or mentor figure.

***** Yes, that's how I'd spin it! I've been thinking on and off today of how to flesh out, twist, and reimagine information from the Cursed Child so that I like it. Once my semester is over and my friend gives CC back, I'd like to reread it and "fix it" for myself. I'd like to put it to writing. I'm a little daunted but I'm trying to convince myself that it's a great opportunity- I shouldn't stress about doing something great/perfect when the source material is already... less than perfect ;)

****** On the contrary, it would work much better than her being Voldemort's daughter. Unlike with magical Britain, we know little to nothing about the magical families and politics of wizarding America. Because the audience doesn't know much about magical America, Rowling could get away with suspension of disbelief much more easily by making Delphi descended from Isolt Sayre instead.

If the story focuses on Scorpius then I would rather have the book filed under a different series...without the "Harry Potter" title.

I don't even think it's the reason JKR is doing it tbh. I think she's just conflicted between her incapacity to let the world and characters she created go and the fact that she said before that there wouldn't be an 8th book.

And so there comes this play which script she didn't write but still approved of, and because people started "opposing" it she decided to declare it canon.

It probably doesn't help that people are still very invested in her story, I mean, why the hell are we all here after all? Because we love the HP world and we couldn't let it go after the last book either.

And so people kept badgering her about releasing new stories related to HP and people in the industry are probably doing the same because they know they can create pretty much anything and the fans will be there to buy it.

I mean, I still don't really like the idea of this play existing, but I understand why it does from her perspective.

Though I am a bit mad at her for the whole #DontBeWormtail ridiculousness. You don't declare a story to be canon and a sequel to your very famous and beloved books and choose a medium to release it that means very few of the fans will be able to enjoy it AND on top of that try to shame them for being interested in it and wanting to know what happens in it. That's pretty shitty of her.

If I was interested in the play, I would have loved the spoilers because there was no way that I would have been able to go see it.

** Sigh! I'm not sighing at your thread or its content, just at the fact that I have a lot to say and I know that it'll cause people to toss downvotes at me.

I believe that the Cursed Child is canon. Yes, I'm starting off big. It's written by the author of the series and expands to the series. It's not like the movies, which are adaptions, it's original content (in sense of the word) and that's how it should be treated. The issue is that fanfiction is around and we've seen it all done before and we instantly groan about another time-travel story. Harry Potter fanfiction is by far the biggest I have seen, not that I read anything besides HP. It's so vast and detailed that it makes any new content by J.K seem overused. I'm sure she knew that. What else could she have done without treading into something that's been done by ample amounts of fanfiction? Saying that CC isn't canon triggers me because it's like saying that Deathly Hallows isn't canon because Dumbledore died. Change is good. I like that J.K switched it up.

There are things that I disagree with. Voldemort having a daughter, for one. It doesn't fit his character and that also triggers me because I cannot see him raising a child. Also, where the hell was this child during Harry's stay at Hogwarts? It's needlessly plopped it and it's terrible worldbuilding and it'd jar me if it just appeared. From what I've gathered, Harry and Ron aren't the main characters, Albus and Scorpius are. I imagine that J.K didn't want them overshadowed. I mean, Harry fought Voldemort and won. I can see him goofing around with Ron, just from that.

My mum hasn't read fanfiction and she adores the new book/play/whatever it is. She thinks J.K is a genius for doing it. Maybe fanfiction has warped our perception of the series. We're at a point where no trope is new and every story will have one or two. I'm sure if CC came out years ago, we'd all be excited and calling it fresh and new, ignoring the flaws. But as I said. What could've J.K done that hasn't been done in a fanfic?

My fingers are tired, so I'm stopping. I haven't read or seen CC, so I like to think my post is rather neutral, but I may be wrong in every aspect and I accept that.

My headcanon is that it's a damn good thing for Delphi that Voldemort and Bella died when they did. He probably needed his own child for some horrible ritual and that's why he got Bella pregnant. Or else just continuing Slytherin's bloodline.

** I think that if I was not someone who had read fanfiction, I would see the book as a badly written plot. Because I have read fanfiction, I see it as a badly written plot with embarrassing similarities to the fanfiction written by pre-teens who are just starting out. My father doesn't read fanfiction, but was pretty amused with the plot when he learned about it. I'm very glad I wasn't looking forward to this story. Otherwise, I might have been as offended or irritated as others who really cared.

Also, a lot of people keep saying that we have to remember it's just the script to a play. I'm not sure what this has to do with anything. Yes, that means that it won't be the same as reading a novel. However, that doesn't change the fact that a lot of people think the plot sucks, and it doesn't change the fact that it has horribly cringe-inducing things like Delphi's hair (or maybe just her mere existence).
