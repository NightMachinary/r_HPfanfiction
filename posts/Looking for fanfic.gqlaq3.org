:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fanfiction (not sure if it was in fanfiction.net or ao3) but I think it was about an OC/SI and they walked into the lake? I think Cedric saw them from a window and saved them. When asked why I think they replied something along the lines of "I wanted to see if this was real" or something. Everything that happened here was early on in the story, I can't remember much after that.


** linkao3(6442123)\\
linkffn(12560378)\\
both of these have Cedric as a main character\\
I think you're talking about Echoes though.

  What use is knowledge of the future when she can't bring herself to care? She owed this world nothing - this story would continue without her. Death took a chance, gambled on the wrong soul, and now she has to pay for it. No one ever said the Wizarding World would be all fun and games, especially not with a Dark Lord's imminent revival, a Headmasters penchant for manipulation, and a Boy-Who-Will-Die's stubborn tenacity. Not that it will matter soon, anyway.Semi-Realistic, Somewhat Dark SI/OC (more OC than SI).

  "To the well organised mind, death is but the next great adventure" --- Albus Dumbledore. Pretty words, yeah, but she didn't expect them to be so damn literal. Sorta-SI/OC.

  When someone dies and is reborn, especially reborn into a fictional world, one would assume that their first reaction would be to change the world around them to their liking. I'm here to tell you that what I did was, in fact, the exact opposite. I'm the girl who went out of her way to change absolutely nothing. Why? Because fate chose wrong. I'm not a hero. SI

***** Ahh I dont think it's this one either. I think Cedric was in class when he saw the character walk in? And by the time he went out I think there was another professor(?) Maybe another group of people looking there too.

** UPDATE: found it [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10519878/chapters/23220684]]\\
Pretty sure I know which one your talking about. It's Harry that walked into the lake to see if this is real and he's in Hufflepuff and he say's to Cedric "Why are we both alive Cedric?" and that really creeps Cedric out ,he's the master of death in this one, he almost drowns while at the Dursley's when he was younger and I pretty sure that he's being haunted by his memory's of the last timeline so that's why he didn't think this was real and after he get's saved by Cedric Harry's put on suicide watch to make sure that he doesn't try it again. I'm pretty sure that The Diggory's adopt Harry. I unfortunately don't have a link to the story but maybe if I describe it someone else would know what I'm talking about. I could try to find it again but that may take a bit. Will get back to you if I find it. Pretty sure it's on AO3

  It was his second time dying. And soon after, it was his second time coming back to life. Somehow, he was still alive. And he was living his life all over again
