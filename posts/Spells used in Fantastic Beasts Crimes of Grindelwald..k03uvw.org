I think this is rather more advanced - it seems to be a spell to turn yourself two-dimensional.

*** No, it's a variant of the shield charm /protego/. What I mean is that, the second part of the battle, in which the blue flames gain shape is similar to /fiendfyre./

**** If you watch closely (or read the script) you will see that the flames getting out of control and turning into beasts is the result of the skull smashing within the fire. It seems like that is not a normal part of the spell at all but rather an interaction between the magic of Protego Diabólica and the magic of the skull.

***** I agree, and arrived at that conclusion when someone said the same thing on the harrypotter subbreddit.

  another way to look at it, is that if you look to Grindelwald's speech, he uses smoke he inhales from the skull to show visions to the gathered crowd... perhaps the contents of that skull when they came into contact with the spell, boosted the spell and made it to show its true visual nature.
