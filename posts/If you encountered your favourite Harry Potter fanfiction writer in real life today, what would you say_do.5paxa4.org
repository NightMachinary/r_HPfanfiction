*** So many authors have "something" come up. Like RL issues or school or a new job or /computer issues/. Life is understandable. But hard drive failure? That's ridiculous; cloud storage is /so/ easy. Losing important data to a broken computer is pure incompetence.

Back up your data, people.

****** Not sarcasm. Google drive starts getting laggy after you put 50k words in one doc, but you can just make a new doc and start where you left off. And I can access my work from anywhere with ease.

** Tell them how much I enjoyed reading their fics, thank them for the great hours I spent doing just that and wish them a good life in which they'll hopefully have time/motivation to write more.

That's what I'd like to say at least. I'd prolly stumble around and look like an idiot though.

** Ask them about their process on how they create a story from idea to published, such as outlines, timelines, etc.. I would love to learn how my favorite author creates their stories.
