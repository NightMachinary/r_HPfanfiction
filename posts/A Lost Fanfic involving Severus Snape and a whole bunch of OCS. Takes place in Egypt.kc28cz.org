So I read this story ages ago but it was one where Severus I think married Lily. They ended up having two kid however Lily dies during the war. It might have been one child was maybe Jame's child but Severus blood adopts one, not sure. Anyway he drains his bank, and take both the kids to Egypt. The kids are both young, one's a girl and one's a young harry. There they settle into a community. He stops Dumbledore from finding them. The kids attend classes that promote early magic use. Harry I think get a training wand. The daughter I think is in daycare. Severus studies and works at the school during the day. He falls in love with on of the staff member. They end up getting close and visiting her family with the kids. The woman Severus ends up dating know about their mother dying and doesn't try to push being their mother.\\
