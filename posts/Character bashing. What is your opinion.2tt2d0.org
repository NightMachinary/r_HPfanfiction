I think it's okay when done in a way that makes it somewhat canon-compatible... for example, I hate Weasley-bashing, but Dumbledore-bashing is okay. What about you?


** To me, "bashing" is categorically poor writing. People have different ideas about what it means, though, so I'll spell out what I mean by it:

a) Setting up characters as straw men, who act, think, or speak in irrational, obvious, stupid, or outright senseless ways, all in the service of setting them up as a target to be bashed. Making their positions intractable - they will not change their minds, attitudes, or actions, even in the face of prudence or pragmatism.

b) Having the characters pop up throughout the narrative for the sole purpose of being bashed - they undergo no development, they don't move the plot along, they're simply there to be wrong, and for Harry to monologue at them about how wrong they are.

c) Taking the negative attributes of a canon character and highlighting them, while at the same time either inventing brand-new negative traits for them or getting rid of their positive qualities. Or, in some truly awful cases, both.

Examples:

Harry goes to Gringotts and discovers that, gasp!, he's never gotten a bank statement (never mind that no one in canon ever gets a bank statement), that Dumbledore, in his capacity as magical guardian has been stealing from Harry (never mind that "magical guardians" aren't a thing), and that Harry stands to inherent untold riches from the various Lordships he's entitled to (never mind the fact that this is blatantly stupid.)

If you're going to write an evil and/or manipulative Dumbledore, at least make him smart enough so that his plans can't be foiled by Harry walking into a bank. Point A - Dumbledore is a straw man and his plots are easily uncovered.

Dumbledore shows up at the bank with a big speech about the Greater Good (never mind that this was Grindelwald's pet phrase, not Dumbledore's) that rambles and makes him look like an idiot. Point B - the only reason Dumbledore is in the scene is to make him look bad and set him up for a fall. That's not a story, that's a cheap version of /The Count of Monte Cristo./

Aside: Revenge-as-plot can work, but not this clumsily. "Bashing" tries to deliver the payoff too early, before we feel that the characters have earned their just desserts. It's all about the buildup in a story like that.

Then, of course, you have Dumbledore nattering on about Harry's safety and forbidding him to leave and Harry pulling some awesomeness out of his ass to do it anyway. Point C - highlighting Dumbledore's negative attributes while forgetting about his intelligence and magical acumen.

In other words, bashing is terrible, don't do it. By all means, create huge, evil, messy problems for your protagonist. Just don't take a character and pull a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RonTheDeathEater][Ron the Death Eater]].

For the love of Merlin, yes. So, so many "manipulative" Dumbledore fics where Dumbledore is practically braindead.

**** I prefer the take that Dumbledore was just being way too involved because of the prophecy. Dealing with his finances and fan mail so that he wouldn't have a public image until he made one. I mean for fucks sake, he obviously wasn't evil, just a little touched in the head if you look at the overview.

I am saving my own comment because I am writing a piece of fanfic that won't be public anytime soon but it seems so easy to slip into Dumbledore bashing that I should remind myself not to. I swear fanfic authors just see characters with flaws and rip into them because of it.

** Incredibly annoying. I have characters I dislike too, but I read an (otherwise canon) fic recently where Rita Skeeter was basically a Death Eater. Seriously? There are ways to write Rita Skeeter as an antagonist without making her OOC.

In addition, it's often just a convenient method to get a love interest out of the way, or to unite the characters behind a common goal. It's unnecessary, annoying, lazy, and one of the fastest ways to get me to click the back button.

** I don't like it, I've never seen it used very well. It seems like a poor attempt at humour at a character's constant expense. I can stomach some of the mild bashing, but too much and I walk away. It subtracts from the overall writing and makes it appear very childish.

I don't consider pointing out character flaws or portraying them in a negative light as "bashing" I've seen some fics labelled bashing when all they've done is highlight some of the flaws and worked through them. I consider it bashing when it's one-dimensional and serves no point other than to illustrate that the author hates the character.

Peter Pettigrew is commonly bashed in Marauder fics which confuses me as the betrayal hurt because he WAS their friend. He wouldn't have been secret-keeper otherwise.

** If it's a full blown crack fic then yes. Like Ginny in A Black Comedy is borderline bashed but it's fine because it's one big joke. If a fix is trying to be taken seriously then it's just poor writing.

** There was a time when bashing-fics where insanely popular. You could hardly get around on FF.net without a Harry whose inheritence from Sirius' death gained him powers / freedom. Or the Goblet of Fire helped. They were a fun read. But then it escalated to Dumbledore who was really Grindelwald or wanted to be next +Dark+ Light Lord and mostly the Weasleys were portrayed as nothing more then glorified Death Eaters. Except for Fred & George. Or Bill. Or Charlie. Love potions, an unknowing Arthur. And Molly (sometimes on her own, sometimes with help from "Dumbles" was the mastermind behind a lot of line theft plots.

Did I read them? Yes. Did I enjoy (a lot of) them? *Yes*.

But the difficulty with bashing-fics is that they quickly became repetitive, unoriginal and just a way for the author to vent his/her frustrations. And there is the crux of the matter. The author. Eventually bashing fics had nothing to do with the HP-books, or it's characters. [[/u/Lane_Anasazi]] talked about /straw men/ and that's exactly how they became. Completely different, one dimensional, characters who merely bore the names of Rowling's creations we know and love.

*TL;DR: In the beginning I loved bashing fics, but they became old /really/ soon.*

** Way to late to the party but wanted to leave my thoughts. I think bashing can be fully welcomed into parody or crack/super fic that are just meant to make you feel good and you are not looking for a indebt plot, But if you want to read/write a good story there is no place for it. BTW i read both kind of stories

*** To me, it's not bashing as a long as a character acts in a way you could see them act in the original. I mean... Ron leaving Harry and Hermione in a terrible situation is literally canon. Having him do similar is not to far fetched. It becomes bashing the moment the author makes a character act like an idiot or just simply a horrible person as an excuse to make readers hate them and have bad things happen to them, however. For example; Dumbledore. Did he leave Harry with the Dursleys in hopes that they would beat him to near death so he could manipulate him better? No, he didn't. It might have been a poor decicion on his part but it wasn't made out of malice. So suddenly painting him the villain of the story is definitely bashing.

But that's my oppinion. What do you think?

**** But isn't the point of fanfiction characters acting in a different way than the original? Of course backstory and points of divergence are usually required, but I think this whole fixation people have on making characters act just like they did in the books just defeats the purpose of fanfiction. Like honestly, I didn't like how characters acted in the books, that's why I'm reading fanfiction instead.

***** We'll have to disagree on that. To me, fanfiction is about exploring what could have happened if something happened differently. I like fanfictions where the circumstances change, but the characters stay more or less true to themselfs. I can see how ooCs can be appealing, though. It's just not something I like to read a lot.

****** Well I mean, the character's personality would change through the different events they experience, especially in their formative childhood years. Like, I really hate the fics where they sort Harry into Slytherin, but he still acts and thinks like Gryffindor Harry. Like, maybe he'll pause. Few times to consider his words before blurting them out, but he remains hotheaded, moralistic, judgy, and quick to anger. But, fanfiction is meant to be enjoyed, so of course I'd never try to dissuade you from reading what you enjoy =) it just annoys me when people dismiss a fic just cos the characters don't act like their canon selves. Like, of course they're not?!

** Probably too late to chime in, but should it be considered bashing when a character is maligned in order to set up their "redemption" by the protagonist?

For example, there are several Harmony fics --- some quite popular --- that involve Independent!Smart!Harry schooling a very fanon!Hermione on how to "think for herself" (which, in practice, means "always agree with Harry"), that it's OK to disobey Rules and Authority, and so forth. Is that Hermione-bashing?

There are some fics along these lines with Ron.

*** Exactly. If someone absolutly can't stand a character (like many people do Ron, for some reason) then it's understandable that they don't want to write about them or write about them positively at least. I think the best way of going about something like this is to just find a way to get them out of the story. Like, having Ron die in the final battle while heroically saving Fred's life. Or maybe getting him a job in a different country. Something like that.

** Lot of hate for bashing here, which sadly is not a surprise. For me, as long as it's funny or otherwise entertaining I have zero problems with it. Fanfiction is meant to be entertaining, and that is really the only measure of success or failure I care about when evaluating anything an author chooses to do.

*** Well... for me to enjoy a story it's important that a characters actions fit his or her personality, and if an author bashes characters he takes away their credibility, dumbs them down, makes them do unrealistic and OOC things. bashing to me is not the same as writing a character differently or more negatively, I have no problem with authors writing a character different than it has been in canon, I only have a problem if they become one-dimensional and unrealistic in their motivations. That's bashing for me.

** I like it if it is done in a way that seems reasonable (that line may be crossed sooner when you like the character thats being bashed). Or in a way like it happens with Ron in /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/. He comes up once at the start just to be dismissed and made a side-character for the rest of the fanfiction. The scene where we see that Harry dislikes Ron in this one is short, intense and answers the question of what happens with him in this text. Its definitely bashing, but short enough to prove a point without being annyoing.

What I greatly dislike are fanfictions that make a cut in the story, sometimes even for a whole chapter, to bash a character. If you're so against someone in the story, just write them out of it but don't torture your readers with a rant about the character. Its not worth your or our time.

On the other side, what I actually love in my fanfiction is emphasizing traits that Rowling introduced but didn't write out well enough (Note that this is almost always a matter of perspective and subjective opinion and experience, and most often the case with the epilouge and post-battle canon). For example, a post-battle fanfiction starts right, for me, if Hermione and Ron break up shortly after, or better, the moment they don't feel like they'll die every minute now. It makes sense in my head that these two would not stay together without danger glueing them together. Unfortunatly such fanfiction get accused quite often of bashing either Hermione or Ron, sometimes even both.

** When the characters go off-the-deep-end evil, like Dumbledore summoning demons or making deals with the goddess of chaos or whatever, I'm done. When it's done as comic relief, for example Ginny and Ron driven out of their minds with jealous stupid, I really don't care, because they're not there to be characters, they're there to show the protagonists capable of curb stomping people. Usually their role in the plot-building is replaced by one of the more minor characters. It's not the epitome of quality literature, of course, but it's easy to write and easy to read. I won't start complaining about canon-compatibility again .-.
