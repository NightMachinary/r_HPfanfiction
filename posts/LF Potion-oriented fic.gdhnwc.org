  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

*** can you give a short summary how the fic progresses? not specifically w.r.t. potions, but story-wise. spoilers okay.

I could never get into this story, but maybe knowing what happens will help me push through.

**** The main conflict so far is between Harriet & co and politician!Riddle. The 4 'main' storylines, aside from the potions stuff, for the 4 books so far are: 1) Riddle unleashes a sleeping sickness in Hogwarts to put the children of prominent politicians in danger and basically use them as hostages 2) Riddle intends to use diary!Tom as a spy, but Tom doesn't like what his future self has become, and goes rogue and tries to gain a body and be the true Voldemort. 3) Peter (who never betrayed the Potters or went to Azkaban) steals a powerful magical artifact, and becomes a professor at Hogwarts to hide from Riddle, who wants it back. The artifact eventually possesses Peter, who kidnaps Harriet and tries to sacrifice her in a dark ritual. 4) Triwizard Tournament, except with 9 champions, 3 each of muggleborn/half-bloods/purebloods. Riddle's goal is to use the tournament to 'prove' the superiority of purebloods, and plans to use Harriet (who is pretending to be her pureblood cousin Rigel Black) as his champion.

  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.
