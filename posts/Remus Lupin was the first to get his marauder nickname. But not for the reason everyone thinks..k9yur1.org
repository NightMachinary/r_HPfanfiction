Once all of the boys had their Animagus forms, they decided on a celebratory run through the forbidden forest during the next full moon.

They played and wrestled and had a grand time. The werewolf even seemed to enjoy itself. They even chased a unicorn, unsuccessfully.

Though when the sun rose in the morning, Sirius shifted out of his form and quietly nudged Peter and James so they could see a glorious sight.

Remus, not having the ability to transform with clothing, was laying with his face in the dirt, on his knees with his rear end pointed to the sky. They giggled and chuckled and fell down laughing waking up the sleeping Remus.

James managed to say through his hysterics, "I guess after a full moon last night, we get another one today!"

And they all fell back to laughing some more until Sirius said, "Come on Mooney, let's find you some clothes before we head back."

And the nickname stuck.


** Given that his name is literally Werewolf McWerewolf II, it would be entirely unsurprising if he ended up with a lycanthropy-themed nickname entirely by accident

**** I remember something similar being pointed out in a MLP crossover, when Twilight noticed that several people had names related to their character or occupation, such as Severus being severe, and Sprout teaching herbology.

***** Prince of Slytherin has a whole sub plot about how there are minor seers that are hired by a lot of older families that help with naming children to give more power to their names by associating them with what they will do with their lives.

***** I read a fic that explained the ‘coincidence' of characters being named by their subject by them choosing ‘Names of Power' that are Arithmantically significant. If you choose something related to your discipline then it gives you extra power in that discipline e.g. Professor Sprout and Vector. The number of letters and syllables count be calculated via Arithmancy to be significant. It was why Albus had so many middle names too.

I can't for the life of me remember the fic name but if anyone can link it I'd be grateful.

*** That his name, more literally, is Wolfson John Wolfy is also pretty funny
