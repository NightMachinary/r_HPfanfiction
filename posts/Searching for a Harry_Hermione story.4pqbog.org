I read a story many years ago that I just can't stop thinking about. Im looking for a Harry/Hermione story where they start a top secret school to get themselves and others away from Hogwarts, using one of Harry's ancestral homes that house portraits of his parents. Pretty sure they live as nudists in the story, getting itchy whenever they are wearing clothing in the home. In addition to Harry and Hermione choosing to be nude their home/school, I believe Lily and James made the same decision and many students and professors at the school choose nudity. I am having no luck finding this story!

I found it by googling 'harry hermione school home nude' and boy do I wish I didn't. That is some next-level crap.

  Harry finds out that things are not what he thought. it turns out that he is not the only surviving Potter. Warning this is not a story that you read to your children. Contains nudity. detailed sex scenes. sex scenes between members of the same sex. I own none of the characters i just like to fool around with them.
