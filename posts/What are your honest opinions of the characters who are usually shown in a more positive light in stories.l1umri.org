Snape is a melodramatic manchild. He acts like a martyr for what was done to him as a child by the Marauders yet he also gave back just as good. The thought of him stalking through Hogwarts with his cloak billowing is very funny to me.

Malfoy is pathetic coward who immediately starts crying then things get hard, He might be his way become of his father that doesn't excuse all the stuff he does.

These aren't exactly original but I want to see others opinions.

*** Untrue.

Snape is unfair, yes. But he's not the type to give people ridiculously unfair grades unless they actually deserve it. He would, however, be more willing to give Slytherins second chances. Hermione had a high grade in Potions, even when Snape was a Professor. Yes, she had an even higher grade with Slughorn as Professor, but Slughorn had an entirely different motive. He was a sycophant.

I know someone is going to tear me apart for this, but I'm making en educated guess with everything I know about her.

**** Hermione's potions are consistently described as the best (or second best, in the case of HBP), so Slughorn isn't being biased at all. Snape, on the other hand, acts like Malfoy has the best potions even when the narrative remarks that Hermione brewed the best potion (the books are in third person limited, so that isn't biased in any way), which would suggest that he is being very unfair.

***** He is unfair in /comments/, yes, and also in general classroom attitude, especially towards people who just /don't get it/ (see: attempting to poison Trevor/making the children think hes going to poison Trevor bc I can't believe he would /actually/ kill Neville's pet). But somehow I don't think he's unfair in his /markings/. There is one instance where Harry sees Snape scribble something that "looked suspiciously like a zero" on his whatever-it-was before walking away, and /that is it/. There is /no/ instance that states clearly that Snape is biased in terms of marking students' work, except to generally not like it when people /quote the book verbatim/. This is understandable given the fact that he knows from personal experience and experimentation that the book can be wrong, and presumably wants his students to learn this as well.

The whole "favouritism towards Malfoy" thing is likely because Malfoy hates Harry Potter and Snape sees a kindred spirit. I know him being Malfoy's godfather is a common trope, but it honestly doesn't look that way to me. All that is said about the favouritism in their Potions classes is Snape "seeming to like" Malfoy and telling everyone to "look at the perfect way he sliced his whatsits", not calling Malfoy out on his broken arm, and allowing him to flick pufferfish eyes at Harry and Ron without interruption. And also that out-of-control moment in fourth year when Malfoy grows Hermione's teeth. (Yikes! Bad teacher!)

***** but it's always Harry who's saying her potions are the best and from the series we know he isn't a reliable narrator he's kind yes but he's also biased at times so when it's Harry saying her potion was the best in the class if the other option was Draco, of course, he is not going to say Draco was second best. Also we never really get a clear picture of what Draco is like as a student. In book 2 it's implied that the ONLY reason he wasn't top of his class was that the person above him was Hermione.

As I said in my previous comment, the books are in third person limited. That means Harry's bias doesn't factor into how anything is described by the narrator. If the narrator remarked that Hermione's potion was the best, that means her potion was the best. That's how third person limited works.

No, it's not. Honestly, I would say CoS implies that he's not doing very well in school. We first see Lucius chiding him on getting horrible grades, and he responds that the teachers all have their favorites and brings up Hermione as an example. Since he said "favorites", that implies that he's not anywhere near the top in any class besides Potions.

******* I think we can agree to disagree about the POV when hermiones potions are discussed because i 100% believe that we can find scenes showing when it was from harry's pov and when it was from third person.

But for his schooling Draco is not a bad student because he's in NEWT Transfiguration and DADA both classes he took where he wasn't the “favorite” and in the scene in CoS when the Malfoys are in B&Bs Lucious says that Draco needs to get his grades up and Draco responds that the teachers all have favorites and Hermione is the teachers favorite. And the only time we get a more clear version of what kind of student he is, is book 6 when he starts to fall behind. But again he's in at least NEWT classes and learns occlumency over the summer with Bellatrix. So he's not stupid. Even if we don't like him (because trust me he's not my favorite character and i don't like how his redemption arch's are written in fanfic) he's not a bad student or dumb. I think book 6 shows he's pretty smart and pretty good at magic but school wise he's falling behind because well...he's trying to murder someone lolol.

edit: He's in at least three Newt classes.

********* (i need you to know my skin is crawling having to defend draco but i also love this conversation we're having)

But just like we can say that Draco is in NEWT level Potions because Snape favored him and Slytherins we could also say that about Gryffindor students and Transfiguration. And it's noted that the Gryffindors (and non Gryffindors) in DADA NEWT level are all DA members. (then we also have to factor in the real number of Gryffindor students per year because that's something that's always debated on which is another convo all together). And remember even Borgin was unsure if the cabinet could be fixed and safe to travel in so him fixing it himself is a pretty big deal. Also his plains weren't stupid they were half assed because in reality he didn't want to kill Dumbledore. I think they were pretty smart for a 16 yr old boy. He knew enough to know that he could never be tied to the crimes if he used the Imperius curse on Rosmerta(?) who would then use the Imperius curse on Katy. Or with the mead, having her sell it to Slughorn who had mentioned looking for a gift for Dumbledore neither plan come back to him. And even if they believe she's under the Imperius they can't find out who did it.

He also brewed polyjuice potion which is a lot of work and not easy to do, even Hermione says it's a hard potion to make so again I don't think Draco is stupid at all i think he actually has all the makings to have been a pretty decent wizard (magic ability alone) outside of the whole "bringing back Voldemort" mess. So again i don't think Draco is stupid or middle of the road in terms of his schooling. I think he might be pretty smart just a little shit. LOL

And we don't know if the instructions worked well or not that whole situation is so....vague? Which i actually hate because i think knowing more would have helped with world and character building.

I can agree we know that he's on the scale middle or above but we really don't know. I do think him being in at least 3 NEWTs classes isn't a bad sign at all because don't know what other NEWT classes he took. Or just what classes he took overall while at Hogwarts. I personally think he's above average and pretty smart but again he's a little shit and rude as hell and arrogant and those aren't things readers would associate with being smart. He relishes in being praised while Hermione turns red when she's praised so it's like both can be smart but only one shows the reaction that readers (and She Who Must Not Be Named) associate with being smart.

** Harry is a clever, but reckless, kid. He lacks trust in authority, which leads to him taking idiotic actions. He's got some sort of thing going on where he puts the weight of the whole world on his shoulders. He's incredibly driven by emotion and uses that to think more than anything else. He hates bullies. Later on, he's a lot more relaxed in everyday interaction but is even more explosive when upset. He's also better at understanding nuance. So yeah, not some hidden genius. He'd make a decent investigator if he pulled his head out of his ass though.

Neville is socially awkward and lacks confidence. This is exacerbated by his seeming lack of talent in magic, which is caused at least partly due to a poor wand. His development mostly consists of him becoming competent, but he never really becomes amazing at anything besides herbology in the canon. He's a competent dueler, however. In the ministry battle, he actually succeeded in fighting the Death Eaters. Though they might have just been incompetent.

The Malfoys are incredibly prejudiced but care about their family. Their son was the same, but following the war took steps to at least stop the cycle with Scorpius, and may have stopped believing in the prejudice himself. Making it at least a bit awkward for family Christmas. Malfoys remained pretty awful, but Draco moved away from it at least.

Ron is overly emotional, a lot like Harry, and has an inferiority complex. He doesn't like that he's poor and that his brothers are all so much better than him. He's loyal, but because of the inferiority complex thinks people are constantly betraying him.

Minerva is an absent teacher who never takes any move on her students' behalf. She's the master of indignation without action.

Luna is characterized by her rejection of reality. She sees everyone hate her, so she rationalizes their behaviour as caused by something outside of their control. She never gets angry, because that would mean admitting something's wrong. She's a tragic figure, and every time I see Harry not help, I want to punt him. The same goes for stories where she becomes a seer, or everything she says is true somehow. Her father is a nutter, who does care about his daughter but is clearly incapable of helping her. Luna's also my favorite character.

Hermione is bossy and obnoxious, but intelligent. It's hard to gauge how intelligent because there's not a lot of indicators, but she's at the very least talented. Her knowledge comes down to hard work, though she seems to remember a lot of minor intricacies, so who knows.

Snape's a spy. We have no guarantee we ever saw his real personality outside of memories. I find it at least a bit suspicious that Dumbledore, the one who was working with him the whole time, consistently had a perfect explanation for everything Snape did. That's something I dislike in the canon overall; we never got to see to what degree Snape was a spy. I don't think he would have been a nice person, but, you know, saying he was always a good guy pretending to be a bad guy kind of opens a lot of questions.

I think part of it is that the Death Eaters, for the most part, were fighting to incapacitate rather than kill. Their goal was the prophecy.

With the exception of Hermione being hit by Dolohov's wicked spell, the Death Eaters are definitely pulling their punches.

Ron's hit with Confundo, Ginny's Stunned when she's very literally a sitting duck and would beyond easy to capture, and Luna is thrown across the room (possibly by a Stunner) and then the Death Eaters just leave her there.

Narratively, there's also the element of subversion--each of Harry's allies goes down in the reverse order that we expect.

Ron and Hermione are downed first, then Ginny and then finally Luna. Neville, clumsy Neville, is the last man standing beside Harry.

In my opinion, sorting into "dorms" as such isn't entirely a bad idea. It's just the execution of the Houses that makes them bad.

Like, maybe instead of them being about different "traits" or whatever, they were just a way to break up the kids a bit more? Like, the actual groups don't mean anything, it's just how they break up sport's teams, or where they sleep, etc.

Nothing truly meaningful, but having some division of the kids isn't entirely a bad idea in and of itself if you put some thought into it. In my opinion at least, you may disagree.

Yes, but you forgot to mention the fact that other's bias isn't helping the problem. Actually, the entire bloody...ugh! The point is that getting rid of the houses won't do shit. Might help some, but in the end of the day the Houses are only a target lazer.

** Narcissa is not the sweet one while Lucius is the villain. They complement each other in many ways, including their blood prejudice and generally shitty behaviour towards those of 'lesser status'. Both of them are responsible for Draco's behaviour.

Tom Riddle is not a different person compared to Lord Voldemort. Tom isn't some sweet angel who Dumbledore failed to save. Riddle and Voldemort are one and the same, with the Horcruxes having had little to no effect on Voldemort's mental and magical states.

Hermione is not perfect and has her share of flaws, too. She can be rather bossy and obnoxious from time to time, though she has a good heart on the whole. And she's often right when it comes to her criticism of Luna Lovegood.

McGonagall is not more badass and more powerful than Dumbledore. She can't kick his ass or 'put him in his place'. And neither can Snape or Madam Pomfrey.

Harry can't win the war and change the world just because he 'breaks free'/gets 'emancipated'/ forms his own side, etc. Without Dumbledore's help, school-era Harry would go nowhere without making this a serious AU in terms of changes.

And no, (Indy) Harry can't just throw tantrums and grandstand against the gobsmacked Dumbledore in the Great Hall, while everyone just watches in shocked silence. Chances are someone would yell: "Shut up, you loser!" from their table. Hell, maybe some ambitious Slytherin(s) would seize the opportunity to suck up to the Headmaster by telling the edgy, grandstanding 'loser' to settle down.

Madam Bones can't solve everything.

Bartemius Crouch Jr is not a sweet, innocent victim who went wrong totally because of his father (despite the neglect, Crouch Sr was actually shown to be proud of his son, though he was far more fixated on himself). My headcanon is that Crouch Jr /did/ personally take part in either the capture or the torture of the Longbottoms, or both.

Snape is not a sweet Head of House who would do anything to protect his ickle baby Snakes from being bullied by the rest of the school. I like to see him as a fairly competent but otherwise largely aloof Head who delegates matters to his prefects. Snape is as absent in his house as McGonagall is in Gryffindor, except that Snape has a shittier attitude. The Slytherins have learned to just deal with it over the years because, well, that's their Head of House.

Rufus Scrimgeour, though brave and strong-willed, isn't that much better from Fudge. And no, Scrimgeour wouldn't be able to solve the Horcrux problem and be the best thing since sliced bread should Harry give him and his Ministry (which is the same as Fudge's anyway) a chance.

The Unspeakables are not super duper wizards who could put even Dumbledore in his place. They're just a bunch of researchers who spend lots of time down in the Department of Mysteries.

Bill Weasley can't suddenly solve Harry's pseudo-Horcrux problem and make him a glorious Goblin Friend just like that. I doubt any of it can happen, actually.

The goblins are not sweet, misunderstood creatures yearning for wizarding kindness. They're brutes with a grudge against being unable to bear wands. And should the Ministry appease to their demands, the goblins would most likely stab them in the back and eventually use the wands for their (the goblins') own gain.

What a fun rebellion that would be, when goblins come in using their indestructible equipment plus wands. Maybe the next step from getting wands would be to seize all goblin-made goods which their culture dictates should no longer be in possession of a wizard (i.e., after the person who originally 'borrowed' it died).

The goblins can't just take your blood and reveal all sorts of hidden information about you, with a convenient ritual for removing any tainted pieces of souls latched onto you.

Neville is a below-average student who can make some decent improvements with a new wand, yes. But he can't suddenly become the next Dumbledore plus Adonis in one.

Not everything Luna says is true, and neither is she in zen-mode all the time. Luna can and does get pissed off at times, and some of the things she believes are just plain rubbish and downright dangerous (i.e. her governmental conspiracy-theories, as well as the 'Crumple-Horned Snorkack Horn' aka the explosive Erumpent Horn at home).

I like to think that if Pandora had survived, Luna might have gone on to having a similar personality as the character Badeea Ali, from /Hogwarts Mystery/. Luna would still be somewhat 'daydreamy', yes, but she'd have the confidence to show some of her artistic skills right out in the open, like Badeea does. She might even get invested in spellmaking, too, like Badeea (especially as Pandora was known to experiment with magic).

**** Concerning Voldemort, I always found him kinda charismatic in the books (I just love his monologue at the end of GoF). I also find him pretty manipulative (both of his plots in GoF and OotP were relatively effective). But even if Voldemort seem different, I don't think the character deep down truly changed.

Tom Riddle was just a poor, Muggle raised orphan that had who had to earn the sympathy of the people around him to survive, and later thrive. While Voldemort is thought to be one of the strongest wizard in the world (maybe even /the/ best), with an army of sycophant and some close followers who litteraly swore themselves to him.

It's not that Voldemort can't be as charismatic as Tom Riddle, it's just that he doesn't feel the need to charm people anymore, not when fear and awe are just as effective.

** I agree with yours!

Beyond the "bad guys" being redeemed (and I have A LOT to say about TMR/Voldemort who isn't cruel and cunning and who somehow falls for Hermione because she is the only one who ever read a book in decades), I have a lot of pet peeves regarding "good guys" being painted as super saints (and that even without taking into account Saint Lily).

​

Hermione isn't some Dumbledore/Grindelwald/TMR type genius. She's book smart, incredibly hyper focused on her studies, but she isn't the one who would revolutionize the magical world. (Also, sure, she gets good grades, but her whole character is just focused on GRADESGRADESGRADES the moment she isn't dragged into the boys' adventures for plot reasons, and it takes her a lot of time and effort to even get these grades, much more than any other student, it seems---and I can't imagine any of the aforementioned magical geniuses being so reliant on memorizing books).

She also isn't some canon of beauty. It's so frustrating, because it was something that actually made me like her when I first read the novels. But she isn't a pretty girl. She's got buck tooth, her hairs a frizzy mess (and that doesn't mean those hyper carefully curly hairdo she gets in the movies), she's often rude, she isn't anything special and she doesn't take much care about her appearance (which is more than ok). So, no, she isn't some Veela 2.0 that will make every boys and /men/'s head turn the minute they see her. James won't forget Lily's existence by her mere apparence in his time. Remus won't fall for her and her oh so marvelous essays. And Ron isn't the only one lucky in their relationship, damnit (coincidentally, the Weasleys aren't ugly!). AND THAT'S OK. Let her be average, let her be rough around the edges. Why ever should she be some Fleur 2.0 at her worst when she never seemed to even tolerate her in canon?

(anyway, I also have a /thing/ against Hermione/Snape, Hermione/Remus, Hermione/TMR). (And I can't believe people think that Ron is worse than any of them??)

​

Remus isn't some wondrous overprotective Alpha ready to take on the world to protect his precious little cub. 1. He was more than ready to drop his own family at the drop of his hat. 2. He never seemed to care much for Harry (which, I guess, is fair, even if it's frustrating when reading from Harry's point of view). AND HE ISN'T SOME PRECIOUS LITTLE CINNAMON ROLL HIMSELF!

Remus is just as bad as Sirius or James. Loads of fics go on and on about how Sirius didn't truly escape Azkaban for Harry, how he was not responsible enough for taking care of Harry and blablabla. While the man literally suffered through more than a /decade/ being food for Dementors. What, exactly, are we expecting, here? What is the standard? Because the minute it comes to Remus, suddenly, the dude is totally responsible, totally hyper protective of students and children alike, a saint who was a Marauder by mere happenstance. And, sure, James comes off as cruel, Sirius /is/ cruel, and the only "prank" we know of (Snape shenanigans) paints them as totally at fault. BUT REMUS SPEND HIS WHOLE HOGWARTS CAREER DOING THE SAME. He's painted as an accomplice, he either covered for them, planned with them, or just kept silent the whole 7 years. And at some point, even if you just keep silent, you're no longer a saint and no longer innocent.

Anyway, I'm tired of seeing him painted as the male version of Saint Lily. Especially when canon just paint him as a selfish coward who makes questionable decisions (and I mean, being the one adult so obsessed with students' safety and responsibility but forgetting your potion on a full moon?). He only cares vaguely about Harry himself, doesn't go out of his way to tell him anything about his precious James, and only tries to come along with him when it means having an excuse to ignore his newborn son (and it's rather cruel, when the whole series Harry's been aching to have a semblance of family).

​

Daphne, Pansy and co. aren't even noteworthy in the whole series. They were probably the background goons standing behind Malfoy during some of the altercations with the trio. And yet, none of them even blip on their radar. Luna seems to have more charisma than their whole group. Years and years as classmates and they're less memorable than Neville or Terry Boot. The idea of either of them being some Ice Queen who conquered the whole school as well as TMR did is just... /no/. (Also, no matter how poorly I can think of Dumbledore at times, if somehow a Slytherin girl started acting like TMR, she wouldn't go under his radar just because she's oh so pretty and so rich (and pureblooded)). (And from the one or two lines that are given to either of them, they don't seem to be the epitome of cunning and subtlety either).

​

I also must have forgotten a lot of canon, but Minerva isn't the good side of Dumbledore. Sure, I think rather poorly of him sometimes. But he's doing things for a reason (but he's /doing/ something, at least). Minerva is just constantly ignoring everything and everyone and acting mightier than everyone. Loads of fics go on about Dumbledore's unsuitability for his role as headmaster, but Minerva isn't any better and it's rarely ever addressed---hell, in all those fics where people start pointing out that Snape is a terrible teacher, why ever no one is saying anything about her?.

From all the canon professors, she's really not the one I imagine swooping down as Superman to save Harry from anything: she's the one who agreed to drop him with people she considered awful (and she, too, never did anything at all about it), she constantly ignores him the rare times he comes to her with legitimate concerns (and, sure, maybe as a first year it must have been a bit ridiculous, but after 4 years of the same and the progressive return of the Dark Lord, maybe start believing him?) and she never, ever, does anything about the constant bullying going on against one of her own students. She's responsible for Gryffondor and yet, she never addresses the bullying going on in there. So, no, she isn't superwoman, she's probably super over worked, but that's it. She's no auntie, no honorary godmother to Harry.

Also, let's take a minute to remember the fact that she was still the second in command at Hogwarts when Umbridge used BLOOD QUILLS on her students. Just like Remus, at some point, even if you're decidedly not taking actions, you stop being an innocent bystander. Especially when you hold power to act and change things.

*** McGonagall is at the very least competent at teaching and she does at least care about her students in a vague sort of way but her interpersonal and pastoral care skills are god awful. She's a relic to be honest.

If students come to teachers these days with something as serious as ‘someone's going to try to steal the philosopher's stone' the salient point should not be ‘how did the student find out?' But the ‘someone's going to steal it' and go from there. I've written before about how McGonagall would fail a competent government inspection.

She also undermines the self esteem of Neville. ‘Longbottom! Kindly do not mention to anyone from Durmstrang that you cannot even perform a simple switching spell' She's the type who would scoff at any sort of student personal trouble. That doesn't make her a bad person, just a bad pastoral carer.

** I think that McGonagall, has a lot of quality, skilled intelligent, valiant brave, rigorous, a proud fighter.

But as Head of Gryffindor and Deputy Headmistress, oh my god, she's failed so many times.

When Harry, Ron, and Hermione informed her that someone wanted to steal the stones, she did no try to know how and why? she accused them and let them flee without making investigation, since it was protected by Dumbledore, for her the situation was safe. Same when someone accused the trophy protection to be flawed, how dare people accuse the great Dumbledore to be flawed, (even if he acknowledge that he was not exempt from failure.) When the golden trio has been found outside during the curfew, she directly accused them to play a prank on Draco without letting them explain. Resulting in detention in the forbidden forest and 150 points taken, this vast amount resulted in a lot of stress for three new 11 years old students, becoming ostracized for their own houses.

And yeah when Hermione declared that she wanted to hunt a troll, she didn't inquire. She just takes five-point, (yeah risking his own life, by arrogance is nothing compared to playing a prank and being outside during the curfew). When she sees that Harry Potter was skilled on a broom, she takes him and declared that he will play for Gryffonder without asking his opinion or his tutor's opinion, even if it was forbidden. She even purchased a luxurious broom to increase his chance of winning, she breaks the rule for her interest.

Now during the second year, when Harry and Ron were interrogated due to their travel in fleeing car, it was Dumbledore and not McGonagall that asked for their story. When Harry Potter found someone petrified and swear that he didn't do anything, what did she say? It was not my resort. She didn't try to interrogate him, to appease him, when at the same time Dumbledore, assured him of his support, tried to divert his attention to allow him to calm down, encouraged him to talk.

I could continue for the other years, (even if I will have a few fewer complaints.)

McGonagall cared for Harry Potter the book show that, she take his defense, she helped him. She seems to be competent in transfiguration, and maybe a good teacher but I think that she's unfit for the role of Head of Gryffindor and Deputy Headmistress.

It was Dumbledore that allowed the golden trio to find grace with Gryffondors due to their heroic actions, 150 points the same amount is taken by Mcgonnal ( stopping a dark lord from coming back into life with unlimited fund could have allowed them to gain even more point). But he gave the final point, the victory point, to Neville the own dragging down Gyrffondor, the one that showed enough bravery to stand against his only friends, when they breaks the rule, Neville that considers himself unfit of Gryffindor, that he's a Gryffindor and a great one, encouraging him to follow this path.

With a few actions, Dumbledore showed that he's a greater and better Headmaster than Mcgonnal (in terms of personality). He shows empathy, he listens to his student, tries to push them on the right way (even if he has a lot of flaws, and made a lot of mistakes). When Mcgonnal assumes, is selfish, and use authority to establish his one's authority.

It's for that I have many difficulties with some fanfic that bash dumbledore (all Hogwarts problems are due only to him) and when Mcgonnal become a headmistress everything starts to go better.

** Harry isn't some genius. He could probably succeed at all his classes if he actually /tried/, but that doesn't make him a genius who's holding back.

Harry has serious issues with trusting authority figures, I wonder why? He expressly does dumb things because he doesn't trust people. That's the reason for his adventures because he doesn't believe the teachers will solve his problems.

Luna was raised to have no level of critical thinking skills, she is the opposite of the people who read the Prophet in book 5. So we don't know which of her theories she believes there is actual evidence for. But clearly, she does hold some correct beliefs about magical creatures such as the Thestral. So there are probably some real things mixed into the muck of her beliefs.

Hermione's probably some sort of genius, but she's also incredibly superior about things. The Half-Blood Prince comes to mind. If she could get off her high horse, I'd say she should be teaching Luna how to critically evaluate evidence.

Neville is a fat socially awkward guy. He's not stupid, he's not incredibly talented. A new wand doesn't make him amazing. He's not cool because he's super competent, he's cool because despite all these things he keeps trying. Things like him killing Nagini, standing up to Voldemort, leading the DA through book 7, and even asking Ginny to the Yule ball (I could be wrong about this happening). He probably struggled through every one of those moments. He has a goddamn character arc, it's not "new wand, new man." You don't need to erase his flaws to make him cool, fanfic authors take note.

Snape is an inconsistent little shit, my advice? Pick one of the goddamn books of the series, read just the one, and use Snape as he's depicted there. Or just AU him, no reason not to. It's not like he has anything beyond his sense of humor going for him in the original books. JKR couldn't properly decide so you get to make him whatever you want!

** People tend to forget that Narcissa was a Black and was probably raised to be racist blood supremest. She loved Lucius and Draco and I can get behind that. She didn't lie to save Harry, she did to save Draco. You know, her Son. A YouTuber (Harry Potter Theory I think) summed it up perfectly. ‘I like Narcissa as a character but not a person' or something along those lines.

Lucius probably actually was manipulated into becoming a Death Eater by Abraxas but that does NOT erase his crimes. Grandpa Malfoy was probably one of Voldemort's first supporters and also part of the “Knights of Walpurgis”. He still killed, tortured and maybe raped a lot of people.

Hermione is not a goddess of beauty and perfection. She is a nice girl and Harry and Ron's best friend and later Girlfriend respectively. But she can be bossy, close minded and rude. As evidenced by the Yule ball if she did put effort into her looks she can appear very pretty but she cares more about her grades.

This has less to do with Harry Potter and more about Fantastical Beasts but Grindelwald did not immediately regret everything after being thrown in Nurmengard. No his relationship ship with Albus was not always healthy and he probably did manipulate him a lot.

** Please do not hate me and please do not do that thing where you don't like something because it goes against your HC or how YOU personally feel about a character I'm about to list....I love the characters including the evil ones (not to redeem but because I love fiction with evil characters who are evil just because). Also please understand if my comments seem cut off, I have ADHD it's hard to focus once I think of another character I want to list LOL

​

Sirius - I love him I really do but Sirius is not a loving dad figure who washes away harry's troubled past just by existing and I don't like when he's talked about or written in that way. He's FLAWED because he spent so many years in Azkaban and that's ok! He's immature because he was locked up as a young adult and isolated for YEARS. He's arrogant and he's childish and he's rude and doesn't like to listen because he thinks he knows EVERYTHING. So I hate when fics don't write him in that way. Like yes, he's loving and caring towards the people he loves but he's not perfect.

Molly - Listen....I don't think she's evil whatsoever but she's not a saint and it's how she's so often written. Again love her because she is the mother of my all-time favourite Weasley (Charlie) but she's not a saint. Again she is a flawed adult. Also, I hate when she's written in the other extreme as if she's abusive to her children like???? DONT DO THAT! Lolol

​

Ron - I'm not sure where this "loveable perfect oaf" thing came from with Ron and I truly blame the movies for this but Ron also isn't perfect???? Can we not write him like he's never sinned. He too has prejudices against other magical beings and that's ok???? Also, he's not the nicest all the time and that's ok too? I just hate when he's made into a fun-loving perfect friend who says all the right funny things at the right time. GIVE ME DEPTH!

​

Also, just a list of characters I feel get written as saints despite being deep characters with flaws or characters we don't know enough about to really redeem are; Ginny, Hermione, the twins, Narcissa, Blaise, Remus, Regulus

​

Snape - Obviously but more so because I do not like how it's glossed over how entitled he felt to Lily's love and affection. I do not like how based on two memories we see from Snape's pov he's rewritten as redeemable. Snape showed Harry the memories (in book 7) that HE thought Harry should see. So, of course, we do not see Snape and James getting into it. By Lily's OWN WORDS Snape is just as bad as James and his death eater friends because he doesn't stop them from bullying muggle-borns. In fact, Snape IN HIS OWN MEMORY tries to downplay the horrible actions of his death eater friends and is offended she compared him to James (despite that also being the same comparison that Dumbledore and Remus make so that's THREE PEOPLE who say they were rivals and it was not a bullying situation). Snape is NOT a good person because even after school and joining Voldemort he doesn't change because he sees the error in Voldemort's thinking, he doesn't change because he can no longer support Voldemort, he doesn't change because he realizes following his friends was a stupid mistake no...NO he "changes" because Lily's life is in danger. That is not romantic. He felt so entitled to Lily that he did not care if Harry or James died as long as SHE lived. He is the worst kind of man and I hate that fans love him and turn him into this soft perfect being. No, Severus Snape instead of showing Lily that he was truly changed by denouncing the behaviour of his death eater friends doubled down when she didn't forgive him. Continued to believe and follow their hateful rhetoric and hoped that by saving her life she would love him. Because let's be honest what was Voldemort going to do with her after sparing her and killing Harry and James? and ANOTHER thing. Snape didn't stay on Dumbledore's side because it was the RIGHT side to be on, he stayed on that side to ease his own guilt over Lily's death. He didn't change in the last book, he didn't magically become a good person no he was the same man who made fun of Hermione's teeth when she was hit with the engorgement charm, the same man who was Neville's worse fear, the same man who hated harry for looking like James.

​

​

but on the flip side, I can not stand when characters who haven't done anything wrong in the books are painted as mean girls/evil/etc because of /She Who Must Not Be Named/'s own internalized misogyny (Cho Chang, Angelina, Lavender, Parvati, Sybil, Fleur, hell even Rita Skeeter and I don't even like Rita's ass i just don't like how she was described as mannish so often and flamboyant because it reads....well...you know how it reads.)

** In canon or in fanfiction? I tend to consider fanfiction as extremely flexible - there's no character in the series that couldn't be redeemed (or turned into a villain) through fanfiction, as long as it's in a reasonable way.

But if you mean the canon interpretation of most characters, I find that I'm usually more charitable. Snape is interesting because he's one of the only - if not the only - character in the series with a bit of nuance to it. On the whole, I find myself more sympathetic towards him - he's a horrible teacher, but that's pretty common at Hogwarts. He's vindictive and petty, but it's also Dumbledore's fault for keeping him around as a teacher in my view. He certainly had a difficult life growing up (and although he defended himself adequately against the Marauders, it was still 4 vs 1 with them going out of their way to antagonize him). Basically, I see him in the books as a jaded, self-hating man - but an understandable, to an extent, one.

For Malfoy, it's even simpler - he's a child. He was raised from birth to be a monster, to consider purebloods superior and muggles trash, etc. The entire series takes place while he's still a child, essentially - and by the end of it it's pretty clear to me that JKR at least wants us to see him as against Voldemort, but unable to act with the threat to his family. As a person, early on he essentially fills the role of the rich spoiled kid antagonist, but he's also fairly competent/smart, and is certainly an interesting character to try to include more of (to develop/explore).

** Snape is a character who has had a pathetic life. He grew up in a emotionally abusive and neglectful home, possibly physically abusive and was poor. His first friend was Lily Evans, with whom he felt connected with. In the train, he meets two boys who end up becoming his bullies for most of his Hogwarts education. He is sorted into Slytherin and is introduced to the darker influences in the society. As Sirius said, he knows a lot of curses, but has anybody thought of why? He was obviously bullied by some pureblood supremacists in Slythetin for being a half-blood and being friends with a muggleborn and also probably bullied by the marauders. He gave as good as he got but it is 4 v/s 1 and, the odds are not in his favour. He's humiliated in front if the school where he breaks his friendship with his only friend by calling her a mudblood. He begs for her forgiveness and is further driven into darker tendencies. He is then almost killed or turned into a werewolf courtesy Sirius Black and is saved by his enemy-James, to whom he now owes a life debt. Now, were the Marauders appropriately punished , no. Did he get justice, no. These events are the driving force behind his decision to become a death eaters. Then, he becomes a spy with two masters, keeps a facade? for many years and bullies children. Was he good? No. Was he bad? No. He was both and neither of them.

I feel like Percy should have been the one to die after having just reconciled with his family. For me it would have been so...hurtful lol i do think Fred should have been badly injured and maybe even lost a limb. I think Arthur also should have died it doesn't make sense that the Weasley family walked away with one member dying also i think there's just an innocent charm to Arthur that would have made his death really hurt more.

I debate on this one but i also think Ron could have died as well, in fact the trio making it out never really sat right with me and i remember going into the series fully ready to see Ron dying either before the battle or during the battle and it not happening was a little...eh to me lol

McGonagall should have died defending her students like yes she wasn't the best teacher but she def would have risked her life protecting those children and i wish she had. Especially after the scene in the ravenclaw common room between her and harry ugh that would have been great

Hagrid for reasons listed above

Now for like deaths that i don't really have an explanation for i just think they would have hurt but also been realistic because it's a battle. Either Seamus or Dean, Luna or Neville, both Patil twins, Ernie Mcmillan, Romilda Vane, Lee Jordan, and i would have solidified whether Lavender died. I think if Lavender is dead then Parvati can live but if Lavender is alive but just a werewolf (i HATE that we don't have confirmation on that) then Parvati is dead. I also think that one or two more teachers should have died and then a few more unnamed student. In my mind there's always a Slytherin student or two or three who came back to fight with their classmates and having them die would have been great (my personal pick would have been the Slytherin who put his name in the GoF coming back to fight because Cedric's death could have so easily been his death)

Oh and Hannah Abbott her story was so tragic to me and i feel like she would have risked her life for another student that or i wish she (and other non Gryffindor students) would have been mentioned a bit more in the battle.

Like my list isn't huge but i feel like it's more realistic because the battle was pretty bad and yet aside from Fred, Tonks, Remis, Colin, and possibly Lavender there aren't too many other characters mentioned as having died and that always confused me. Also it's happening at Hogwarts so there being more students than adults dying to me makes more sense and therefore makes the battle that much more devastating to the wizarding world. (Therefore getting harsher sentences for the DE's involved)

Like, going into a children's series I expected just everything to be nice and clean and not at all heart breaking. Going into an adult series, I expected cursing and death and gore and just...more.

do you mean the "you didn't hear it from me."? lolol

I see Harry/Luna more than i see Harry/Ginny (Linny is a whole other story) because he expresses so much genuine affection and respect for her throughout the end of the series. And the way she seems to really understand how he's feeling when even his friends have a hard time doing that idk it sparks joy in me lol

**************** I still like it more as a really close friendship, but I do see your view.

Everyone keeps saying 'each to their own' and it's annoying. 'you didn't hear it from me' is more for church gossip.

i hate the south. i mean. NOLA is great and fun, but where I live....Not so fun. Although, the balls and stuff are fun.

** Eh, I don't really form opinions on characters based on the idea of them, I like or dislike them by how they're depicted in any given fic.

For example, I find canon Snape and Malfoy risible characters, mid-level baddies whose initial characterization just doesn't fit with how they're depicted in later books, badly failed attempts at making the reader sympathize with them notwithstanding. But I'm not going to mind them being shown in a more positive light in fics, if they behave in a more respectable manner.

In the same way, book Hermione and Ron (and even Harry at times) are pretty fucking annoying, but I sure don't mind reading nicer versions of them in fics. I do mind reading worse ones tho, I don't think I've ever found any where it didn't feel like straight out bashing.

** 1. Neville is a stupid lump of lard.

2. Harry got lucky all the time.

3. McGonagall is not a good Head of House. She deducted a lot of points from the trio in the 1st year for which they were shunned and she had Longbottom locked out of the Gryffindor Common Room in 3rd years in spite of dementors and a presumed mass-murderer that was at large.

****** when did Harry be asked to kill their headmaster and get death eaters into school at age 16? when was harry told that if he didn't do the above he would be killed? we don't know exactly what happened after(do we? I don't remember), but I can't imagine Voldie was very happy that Draco failed. when did harry see his teach mocked, killed, and then eaten right in front of him? when did harry live with death eaters and voldemort in his home, his sanctuary, for months? then after the war i can only assume the world wasn't very kind to draco. they all went through shit, but draco's shit was more. More, in the sense that he went from being a spoiled, loved child to a hated, ostracised 'death eater'. The kid wasn't even of age when most of this went down.
