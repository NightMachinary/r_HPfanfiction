Hi! I recently finished reading [this story]{Story: A Marauder's Plan [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8045114/1/A-Marauder-s-Plan]]} the first HP fanfic I've ever read. The writing was amazing, and the story line and the length!! Loved it so much. But now I cant find anything similar.

I really like the "old family" route the story took, it felt kind of like history to me and I LOVE history! , I also loved the roll of Sirus, however I'd be happy if he was a backseat character too(prefer him alive or "comes back to life" somehow) .

I'm not fussed if it starts when Harry is a baby or a teenager, I don't mind what relationships develop (although I m probably not too keen on Harry / Sirus or Snape) and I don't mind if James and Lilly are alive or not or whatever else may be in a story. I don't mind if he's good or evil, I just want something with that "old family" feel to it.

Is they anything at all? This is why I didn't want to get into HP Fanfic because I knew they'd be one good one, and the rest I would read would be average in comparison. :(


** linkffn(12155794) deals with the Potter and Black family magics, and even has scenes from the war with Grindewald and I enjoyed it but there are some "author quirks" that some people won't enjoy, mostly having to do with odd punctuation (or the lack thereof). It starts out at the graveyard scene in Goblet of Fire and goes from there.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.
