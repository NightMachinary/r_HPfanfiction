I'm looking for a fanfic where Harry's parents believe him to be dead so they left the magical world and then find out years later he survived.

Also one where Harry goes into the muggle world and I think he became a baker? His friends try find him but they don't until years later? Ring any bells?


** Not sure about that first one, but I'm fairly certain that the second is linkffn(Powerless by Potato19). It's... not very good.

#+begin_quote
  In the final showdown with Voldemort, Harry loses his magical abilities, rendering him powerless. Alienating those around him, he attempts to assimilate to Muggle life, figure out the (a-little-too-close-to-home) reason behind his inabilities and, hopefully, regain his magic.

** The first one rings a bell with me. I'm fairly sure it was one author who started it and then abandoned it, and then another author picked it up afterwards. The first author was pretty good, but the second author fucked it up.

But I can't for the life of me remember where I read it.

  Harry is the younger brother of the Boy Who Lived and is a little strange. He hears voices no one else can hear, he knows things no one else should know and he's just this side of crazy. Oh, and everyone thinks he's a squib. When it comes to Harry, however, all bets are off and nothing is entirely certain.

  Harry stared out the Dursely car window morosely. 'I would have went with Sirius if he had asked.' He thought. 'I would have run from the law and Durselys with him.' He paused, blinking. 'I could do that on my own! I could run away' Summer after 3rd year
