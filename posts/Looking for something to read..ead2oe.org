I'm going to get on a long flight in an hour. Toss me some recommendations! Can be anything from AU to crossover to not even HP. Just looking for something reasonably well written.


** By no means do I think it's perfect, but Fate by thetruespartan was the a great thing to read when I was stuck in an airport

** Firstly, if you haven't, try [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]]. Original story, groundhog day-style in a fantasy world.

As for HP fics:

linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) is one of my faves. Heavily AU/sorta Xover with Alanna the Lioness, but you definitely don't need to have read Alanna to enjoy it.

linkffn(The Changeling) is popular for good reason, if you've never read it. Slytherin!Ginny.

linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus) is...weird and hilarious. I don't know how else to describe it.

Have a good flight!
