:FlairText: Request
:END:
So what I'm looking for is either a time travel fic where the time traveler goes back in time, changes stuff, then comes back (forward?) and sees the changes s/he caused by stuff done in the past. Plus points if s/he goes back and forth and changes the timeline each time. Another thing I want to read is where a character travels back in time, falls in love, goes back to their own time, and resumes the relationship with the now older love interest.

I'd love to see these two combined!

I prefer reading about Hermione, but Harry's ok as well. If there's a great fic with other mains, I'll give it a go. And I really don't want to see them become evil or death eaters or dark lords and such. That just makes me sad. =P

I would appreciate any help!


** And here I thought the request would involve Deloreans and Policeboxes.

  In her sixth year, Dumbledore makes Hermione a key figure in a plan to help Harry defeat Voldemort. (It's difficult to summarize this without spoilers--- HG/SS; there's a Time Turner involved but probably not how you expect; the story really gets started in Chapter Three.)

***** She dates Remus first and then they break up amicably before she starts going out with Sirius. There is a pretty great threesome (Quick! Sirius/Remus/Hermione have to have a threesome or Remus Dies!) in there though.

******* It's my favorite lemony fic. Top notch lemons. I may be biased by the fact that SB/HG is my OTP though. Have fun! If you like this pairing and want a fic that's a little less smutty, linkffn(one hundred and sixty nine by mrs j's soup) is my favorite fic of all time.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

  FOUR PART SERIES - When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the Veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. (Pairings: HG/SB, HG/RL, and Canon Pairings) - Rated M for language, violence, and sexual scenes. *Art by Freya Ishtar*
