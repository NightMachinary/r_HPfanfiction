There is a story that I am trying to find at cannot. I recall reading it several years ago. The premise was that after using the cruciatus at the ministry, harry realized that dark magic is not evil, and simultaneously discovered he had slytherin family. He changes family (I recall his eyes become violet) and then of course runs into problems with the order. I remember he was friendly with draco (not death eater) and James potter turned out to be alive.

Has anyone heard of this/know where I can find it? I think the other may have been dreamer of many dreams.

Thanks
