:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm trying to find a fic I read. I remember it's SS/HG, it involves her going back in time with the Time Turner, she hooks up with teenager Snape and invents an alternative hair care produce that rivales Sleekeazy. She goes back to her own time to discover Snape has developed the product into an entire line, a company, and that they accidentally bonded to one another. I can give other details, but Google is not helping, so I'm wondering if it was deleted at some point.


** Vanity by wartcap. I think? I know it is on Ashwinder, not sure if it is elsewhere.
