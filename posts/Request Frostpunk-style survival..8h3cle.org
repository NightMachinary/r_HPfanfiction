Hello!

For those of you who don't know about Frostpunk, it's a new city management/survival game; and the objective is to survive for 45 days in an eternal winter situation with decreasing resources and ever increasing discontent.

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRLU5DuZHr8][This review may help if you don't know about it.]]

It also helps that the people are from London.

So, the request! A story of survival, of course. The characters fighting against the environment, and hopelessly losing. Or barely winning.

Of course you can say: "They have MAGIC, duh!"

Well, maybe for X reason it's not as useful as it should be. HP-Magic needs to be nerfed a little, to be fair.

Worthy of Magic linkffn(12800980) scratches the itch somewhat, but if you have anything different...

(If possible completed or update in the last 3 months please!!)

Thanks.


** I'm actually starting a new story where harry is infiltrating a new earth where his magic doesn't work at all save internalized magic(animagus, apparation, and dissillusion atm) where his resources will be rather scarce and he'll only have a limited amount of charges where he can request more resources from home. If he uses up all his travel charges requesting supplies, he can't go home.

It'll be a fallout and elder scrolls fused crossover with harry forced to hunt down magic tomes to learn the new magic, find a new place for a potential colony, and discover just what "padfoot was here" scratched on walls means exactly.and potentially a love interest from a different series. Buffy maybe?

It'll take place in Atlanta, GA also. I think we all get the meaning of that.

****** There aren't really any spoilers. The only time Temeraire dragons are brought up is in the last instalment of the series, and even then, it was only in comparison to the dragons of the Harry Potter world. Reading through the fic, I completely forgot that it was set in Temeraire until that last chapter.
