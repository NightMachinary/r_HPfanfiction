** The one cliche I really enjoy that people frequently criticize is political kids. It's a fine line for me. If it starts getting into heavy marriage contract, family magic, Neo-Victorian stuff, I'm out. But eleven-year-old kids imitating and sometimes helping their parents in jockeying for political control in a way that's probably too mature for their age just works for me.

Honorable mention: I don't mind magical cores (even though I dislike Super!Harry), but I actively /like/ magical exhaustion. It doesn't even have to be a separate "mana reserve." I just think that magic should use energy, and using too much of it will tire you out. I think that makes a better story than being able to cast powerful magic all day with no ill effects.

That's what kills me about HP:MOR. It's got like a half-dozen stellar ideas (which is a half-dozen more than most fics) but it's wrapped up in a story with such an obvious self-insert masturbatory power fantasy of a main character that it's nigh-unreadable.

Intelligence and curiosity are the main things I like about characters, that is why I like Tom Riddle. I think Harry does not fit to him at all and that's why I do not like this pairing.

Hermione does not fit to Tom either IMO, she is only book smart and suppossed to be the opposite of charming. She would be his inferior in every way.

I think to make it work Tom Riddle must be paired with an OC.

** - antagonistic and manipulative Dumbledore. I don't like it when he just drops his year long plans just because Harry became suddenly self-aware

- pure-blood society, cliques and customs: I like it when there's a bit of a conspiracy to keep knowledge and power away from Muggleborns and/or Harry (fics like Made of Common Clay really appeal to me for that reason). Most fics just go way overboard and Harry immediately becomes a super-duper-Overlord and has trillions of Galleons, owns the Prophet, has the blocked magical gifts of natural occlumancy, legilimency and animagus transformation, etc.

- I don't mind magical cores. IMHO most criticism towards it is focused on how it isn't canon, but ignores its utility in grounding the magic a bit and giving rules and limits. But I guess I can see why people who enjoy the nonsensical magic in HP like it (moving it from "soft" to "hard" magic as Sanderson would call it). I think it's a good starting point to allow your characters to start [[https://coppermind.net/wiki/Sanderson%27s_Laws_of_Magic][solving problems using magic]], not that there aren't other ways to do it too.

- teenagers acting like adults. Unless it's a time travel fic you're saddled with teenagers if you want to write a HP fic set during the Hogwarts Era. I totally don't mind them acting a bit wiser than their years, as long as they make sense.

** Lust to love. I simply find it much more believable if Harry or Hermione are shown to be more than whitewashed romance protagonists. There's a time and place for mushy romance, but teenagers are also horny bastards with raging hormones. Harry might crush in Cho, but he sure as hell also fantasised what she would look like naked, on top of him. And given that he is a guy, he probably also thought about any girl/women between 14 and 40 in the same position. Amd probably a few outside of that parameter he is not that proud of.

** Quite simply, OP Harry. Not too OP (I'm looking at /you/, Core Threads), but I'm totally down to see Harry train hard till roughly adulthood, then style on Voldemort in a duel.

Harry's incredible resistance to mind magic - /cough/ allure /cough/ - leads to a relationship with Fleur. What can I say? Flowerpot is probably my favorite ship and I think it's a decent way for Harry to initially get her attention and segue into a relationship. It shouldn't be the sole contributing factor though.

MoD Harry. Can't say I've seen many that were even decent though. Always looking for more.

Not-so-nice Dumbledore. If you take his actions in canon seriously instead of just brushing them off as the product of a kid's series, there's some pretty messed up stuff in there. I'm not looking for Manipulative!Evil!GreaterGood!Baby-Rapist!Dumbledore, but the man has some very real issues.

The idea that you are only limited by what you believe to be impossible is a very cute motivation calendar quote, but really not how reality works. If it did even stupid-ass wizards would have figured out how to give their children super-powers by now (just don't tell them what is impossible).

Historically ignorance in fact never helped anyone to achieve anything, or we would have seen (just as an example) human flight much sooner, instead of only when the technological advancement in materials and motors allowed it to happen.

Harry didn't defeat the dementors because he was unaware that it should have been impossible, but because he's an exceptional wizard, has Lily's love protection in him and cares deeply for his friends.
