Been wanting to write the Next Gen characters lately, haven't written fanfiction in a long time either, so I thought why not ask for ideas on here?

Nothing with Cursed Child though.

Am fine with het/slash/femslash.

Would rather write about the characters though instead of just a pairing idea with a character, if possible.


** Albus Severus Potter gets into a fight with his parents for growing a beard like his namesake.

Fred Weasley Jr. resembles his uncle Percy more than his Uncle Fred much to George's disappointment.

Louis, Dominique and Victore Weasley are the first Weasleys not to be sorted into Gryffindor by going to........Beauxbatons

*** If Albus Severus is old enough to grow a beard, then his parents shouldn't care about that. I get that it was just an idea, but in story it doesn't make much sense...

I like the Fred Jr one, that sounds like a good idea, though by resemble I assume you meant his behavior rather than his actual looks.

I always did wonder what would happen if Victoire, Louis and Dominique went to Bexauxbaton instead.

** Hugo is a squib. He ends up becoming extremely close to his muggle grandparents. How everyone else reactions is up to you.

Dominque takes up an extremely unladylike sport (skateboarding, boxing, death defying stunts etc, anything but Quidditch), horrifying her mother Fleur.

Despite nheriting his mother's clumsiness and his father's lack of luck, Teddy Lupin's somehow managed to fool everyone into thinking he's a competent (though insane) auror even though he's. When the department comes under investigation, will he be able to keep up the act?
