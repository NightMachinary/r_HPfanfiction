** Magicks of the Arcane linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane) has phoenixes playing a significant part of the story. The gist is that a phoenix is actually a magical bird that was destroyed by dark fire, and reborn from the ashes.

They are sort of like the ashwinders of birds. Its a pretty interesting take.

Also, tacitly want to recommend the Iris Potter series linkffn(Iris Potter and the Goblet's Surprise). Iris gains the companionship of phoenix crossed with a thunderbird. It has /similar/ powers to Fawkes, but some of the differences are interesting and the description of it's song is a wonderful piece of writing. The fic ended early (due to some obvious but understandable story issues), and has been recently re-imagined by Autumn Souls (who posts on here occasionally).

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

  She's been called many things --- sarcastic, inquisitive, often unapologetically so; quick-witted and resilient, and almost hopelessly reckless; young, small, but fierce and not easily controlled. Iris Potter doesn't do normal, and her fourth year at Hogwarts is evidence enough. Two new tasks. Sort of complete, sort of abandoned.
