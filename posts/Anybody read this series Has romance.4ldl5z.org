** The first two fics in the series do not have romance IIRC, but thats mainly due to the fact that the characters are 11 and 12 years old.

**** The first two fics give you a general idea of the plot, but if you are reading solely for the romance then I guess you could. I havent read the third fic yet and seeing as it is not yet completed, I dont know if the romance has begun.
