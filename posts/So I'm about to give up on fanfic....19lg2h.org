After reading the HP series for a third time, I wanted to try fanfic. I started with the James Potter series, which was decent, but I lost interest midway through the first book. Then I read Dumbledore's Army And The Year of Darkness. I absolutely loved it, and it made me love the HP series even more. But since then I haven't been able to get into any fanfic, because they just don't seem like JK Rowling's writing at all. So basically I'm looking for a cannon story with Rowling's style of writing that's interesting. Thanks for reading this, and I hope you can help.


** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/21/A_Difference_in_the_Family_The_Snape_Chronicles][A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles]] is the story of Severus Snape, from birth to demise, and it completely fits cannon. It's one of my favourite fics.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=305303][Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood]] that spans the canon and next gen characters, set around 50 years after the Battle of Hogwarts.

*** The link to The Snape Chronicles is broken, but [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A-Difference-in-the-Family-The-Snape-Chronicles][this one]] should work. I think it's a brilliant piece of fanfic, and I've read it twice now.

** Fanfic isn't for everyone. If you don't want to read anything that doesn't sound like JK, then your choices are limited. Most writers try to develop their own style rather than imitate JK's.

As for specific recommendations...

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=187656][TenthWeasley]]. I haven't read any of her longer stories, but "Growing Up Weasley" and "Growing Up Magical" (both gen) and "Painted Blind" (Bill/Fleur) are all canon compliant and well-written. The "Growing Up" stories also sound, to me, very JK-ish.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=193853][ToujoursPadfoot]]. Brilliant writer. "Twinkle's Keeper" (Percy, Molly, gen) is good. "And the Pattern Repeats" (George, gen) is heartbreaking and wonderful, but a bit less JK-ish than others. "So, Listen..." (Fred/OC) is not-quite-canon in that it /could/ have happened, but is still the author's own invention. Awesome story, though. "Sunshine, Daisies, Butter Mellow" (Ron/Hermione) is short and sweet and meshes perfectly with canon. You might also like "Water Dragons" (Charlie, Tonks, gen). "Run" (gen) is a masterpiece, but doesn't resemble JK's style at all. I'm recommending it anyway because it is phenomenal :)

I'm afraid that's all I've got for you. I don't read much canon fic.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5200789/1/The_Life_and_Times]]

Work in Progress

This is a Marauder Era fanfiction. It is about when James, Sirius and Lupin are at school. Right now it only has 34 chapters and she only updates like once every 6 months but it is still a great read! Story sticks fairly close to what you could have guessed times would be like then based on the original series by JK

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7919030/1/Resistance]]

Complete

This story is about what happens during book 7 while Harry, Ron, and Hermione are out hunting horcruxes. It is told from mostly Nevilles point of view. It's pretty much exactly what you would imagine went on while you were reading about what the trio was up to. It starts off at Bill and Fleurs wedding and ends just after the Battle of Hogwarts.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/16/On_the_Way_to_Greatness]]

Work in Progress

This is an alternate universe fanfiction. It's the entire series written as if Harry had been sorted into Slytherin instead, and it's amazing! I actually found that I liked this version of Harry a bit more than the one in the original series. He is just a lot more of a badass and much less of a whiny bitch. Beware though because this fanfiction is 10 chapters shy of being complete. You end after reading one chapter of year six.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4315906/1/Dumbledores_Army_and_the_Year_of_Darkness]]

Complete

This is another version of what happens at Hogwarts during year 7 from Nevilles POV. It is much darker than the fanfiction resistance, but I actually enjoyed the intensity of it. Very good read, it is complete with 25 chapters.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize]]

Complete

This is a completely amazing one shot about Dennis Creevey and other members of the DA and I believe some from the Order of the Phoenix. Basically Dennis takes pictures of the scars left behind from the second war, its beautiful and touching despite being around 1,600 words.

Northumbrian has the most faithful characterisation of any fabfic writer ive read. Also s/he has clearly done a lot of research into what JK says happend to everyone post DH. I reccomend all of them, but "The Mind of Arthur Weasley" is especially brilliant

** [[http://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/khk06/fan_fiction_how_to_separate_good_ones_from_the/][This is my standard fic rec comment (fanfiction recommendation):]]

[[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?chapno=1&storyid=619][After the End by Arabella and Zsenya]] - Definitely one of the greats. It was started after /GoF/ and the epilogue was published the night /OotP/ was released. It's twice as long as /OotP/. It's one of the most faithful characterizations I've ever come across and was a totally plausible ending for what we knew at the time. Brilliantly written and you fall in love with the characters again.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650][Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always]] - One of the best [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail][For Want of a Nail]] fics out there. It all goes horribly wrong by the end and the only survivors are Harry, Ron, and Ginny. Nearly suicidal in their depression, they find a way to go back in time to make sure everyone survives. Make sure you read Parts II and III as well, although III hasn't been touched in 2 years.

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/barb/HPATPS.html][Barb LP's Psychic Serpent Trilogy]] - Another post-/GoF/ that covers Harry's last 3 years, I'm hesitant to suggest this. It's wonderfully written for the most part, but I've always felt there was a touch /too much/ personal drama in the relationships, as if she forgot they were just teenagers. But where the series shines is how very /British/ it feels. You get a much stronger sense of the geography and culture of the British Isles that I feel makes it worth the read. Also her oneshots [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/barb/MATB01.html][Mad About the Boy]] and [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/barb/HAH01.html][Horntails and Hippogriffs]] are /delightful/ and give you the fuzzies.

[[http://www.phoenixsong.net/fanfiction/stories.php?psid=2422][The F Words Series by Antosha]] - Taking place and published immediately after the last chapter of /DH/ (but before the epilogue), these are some of the most amazing fics I've ever read. You get to see the characters pull themselves together again after the Battle of Hogwarts. The next time you finish reading /DH/, start reading the series and prepare to have the bittersweet feeling held at bay for a mite longer. Although really everything by this author is amazing. His characterizations are always spot-on and his Luna is probably the best you'll find aside from Rowling's canon.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Methods_of_Rationality][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] - If you haven't read this, you need to do so immediately. The hands-down most hilarious and brilliant fanfic to come out in years. From the description: "Petunia married a professor, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter... " This should be required reading for everyone.

There are more that I could suggest but I think these represent the very best in terms of story, character, and writing. Plus it's hard to come up with these lists.

If you just type in "fanfiction" or "fanfic" or "fan fiction" or "fan-fiction" in the search reddit box to the right, you'll find more threads.

--------------

As far as sites go, I'll second the recommendations for [[http://www.checkmated.com/][checkmated]] and [[http://www.simplyundeniable.com/][simplyundeniable]]. I'll also add [[http://sugarquill.net/][The Sugarquill]] (one of the earliest R/H repositories), [[http://www.phoenixsong.net/][PhoenixSong]] (which rose from the ashes of the great GryffindorTower), and [[http://www.thequidditchpitch.org/][thequidditchpitch]]. Fanfiction.net is like youtube: 99% crap; but there are still some real gems in there if you know where to look. Usually you can cut a lot of the crap by fiddling with the filters (rating>all, books only, word count > 100k, character pairings optional)

Ninja edit: I forgot a really good one! [[http://mujaji.net/kia/][Know It Alls]] is a fanfiction recommendation site (fic recs) that's got consistently high quality links. You can even sort by pairings or protagonists or eras using the tags.
