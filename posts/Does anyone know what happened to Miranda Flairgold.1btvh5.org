She was in the last 1/3 of writing an /amazing/ AU trillogy where Harry leaves Hogwarts to get a better education at a Darwinian -style school in Canada named Akren.

If anyone knows what happened to her, or even just wants to talk about the best AU Harry goes to a different school series ever...an answer would totally be appreciate!

Her Fanfiction Account: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/100447/Miranda-Flairgold]]

Series starts with: A Second Chance at Life

Totally worth the read. (:


** The story really is amazing, however the entire thing is about 10% Harry Potter and continues to fall towards zero as the installments happen.

AU barely describes it, it is almost "this totally different person play Harry Potter on the side".

STILL WORTH A READ...rather awesome, it just is just barely AU HP

As for what happened? I'm hoping she started writing something original, considering the world she put together only paid lipservice to HP anyway.

** I'm going to avoid that story just because it compliments itself in the summary.
