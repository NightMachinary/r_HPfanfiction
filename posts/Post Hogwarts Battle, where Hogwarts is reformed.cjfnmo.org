(Title)

I thought of this;

/Semi-Permanent classes/

Arithmancy & Mathematics, Ancient Runes, and Care of Magical Creatures are required until fifth year.

Potions & Herbology, and Muggle Technology/Technomancy are required until O.W.L exams (they are in sixth year, end of N.E.W.T exams are in 8th year)

/Permanent classes/

Charms, DADA, Transfiguration, History of Magic, the Mind arts, are required from 1-8 years.

/Electives/

Fencing, Muggle History/studies, Cooking, Business, Divination (for gifted seers), Astronomy, Economics


** Muggle Studies should be made mandatory for Purebloods and most halfbloods from 1st year

*** Correspondingly, there should be some sort of Wizarding Culture course for the Muggleborns and raised, so they have an understanding of the world they're entering.

**** How about a single class doing both, muggleborns teach muggle studies and purebloods teach wizard culture? Each student picks a topic they like and prepare a presentation to the entire class. That way it'll automatically keep itself up to date.

***** IDK how informative an eleven year old's school project would be for teaching about an alien culture, but I love the idea of Ron giving a lecture about the Cannons when his turn comes up. "It's what's important!"

****** Well, I'm more thinking year 3+ for students giving presentations. They already have to write super long essays all the time so it wouldn't be too far of a stretch, and I really want to see Hermione giving a two hour presentation on the intricacies of rocket science.
