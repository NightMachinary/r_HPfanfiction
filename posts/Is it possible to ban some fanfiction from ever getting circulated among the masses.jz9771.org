I started reading a fic named Plot Bunnies by elvirakitties. She's a hyped up author so I thought maybe I should give her a chance. Boy, do I regret that now!

In chapter 6, Dumbledore and Voldemort decide to bind Harry in marriage to him on Halloween to end the Second Wizarding War. Harry, being a prodigy of the likes that neither the oldies have ever seen, instead binds Dumbledore and Voldemort in marriage instead and sent them off to a honeymoon.

Guess what the icing on the cake is. Dumbledore gets Voldemort pregnant when he slipped a pregnancy potion into his food. The last thing I read before I nearly hurled my phone into the wall was Voldemort in the middle of his morning-sickness and cursing Dumbledore till the pregnant hoe gets blue in the face.

I feel violated and will refrain from reading fanfiction for a couple of days to scrub that chapter out of my mind. Thank you for listening to me lose faith in humanity.

I miss the days where what you read would have had that effect on me. Believe me, that is not even close to the worst this fandom can throw at you. "A Veela's Worth" anyone? Now that is something that absolutely should be banned from being circulated... Seriously don't read it, even if you usually ignore warnings like "Seriously, don't read it". Just don't. If you ignore the warnings, I take no responsibility for any mental scarring or any triggers being triggered.

Oh, right.

  This is where I am hoping to post my ideas to get them out of my head so that I can continue with other stories.WARN: There will be slash, pairing is Harry with any of the following three: Severus, Lucius or Voldemort (Tom) or a combo the four.

***** You do not believe how much do not believe / consider it necessary to do the right tags.\\
It is too difficult for some D / V, H / T jr., S / Harry (or that just as terrible S / Herminie) etc. to rag.\\
Also to write "Slash" in the description or at the beginning of Chapter 1 is too difficult for some who cannot understand or who do not want to understand that some do not like to read it.\\
Stories start without a clue, hell in one that I read recently (nothing in the tags) he(Harry) was suddenly bisexual in chapter 20+.

** no. But I hope we can continue to encourage people to tag properly, because I hate being blindsided by that kind of thing. Like I'm guessing it was tagged as a crackfic, right?

Though sometimes it's the littlest things that set us off. The worst I've ever been affected by a story was an off handed comment about how this vampire!Steve Rogers was a good vamp because he only drained disabled and weak people, and thus was responsible. It's not the first I've heard of that eugenicist sentiment, but for some reason it messed me up.

anyway that's all to say I feel you. I don't. Think we'll be able to get the sites to change their policies, but I wish we had warning for some of these things because wow, people write some fucked up shite

*** Yes, I am.astounded that people actually kudo these fics. One of elvirakitties' stories actually has Dumbledore paired with Ginny Weasley because the 100+ year old defeater of Grindelwald made a mistake in the marriage contract between Harry and Ginny and Harry, with a stroke of genius, swapped his name with Dumbledore's.

I understand if fanfic writers hate him but why on Earth do they portray him as utterly incompetent? Dumbledore is arguably the most cunning character in HP.

**** Some of it comes down to maturity. Being a young reader, it is easy to see the line "I condemned you to 10 dark and difficult years" and immediately think "MONSTER, HE LEFT HARRY TO BE ABUSED".

I think lot of Dumbledore Bashers in time grow out of it.
