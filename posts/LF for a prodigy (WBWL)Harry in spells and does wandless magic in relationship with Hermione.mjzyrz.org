**** No worries. I was being silly. Your request is fine, and I recall reading at least several fics like that, though I don't remember the names. (They are not my cup of tea, but I kept reading in the hope that something interesting might happen.)

However, my observation is that fans of Wandless!Prodigy!Harry fics on this subreddit tend to despise Hermione and Harmony 'ships; and fans of Hermione and Harmony 'ships tend to despise WBWL and Wandless!Prodigy!Harry fics. By combining the two in one request, you may have therefore triggered both groups.
