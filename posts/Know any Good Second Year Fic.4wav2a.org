I'm looking for a fanfiction that has the second year in it. It may start from first year, but it has to contain the second year in the story.

That's the only requirement.


** *The Very Secret Diary* chronicles Ginny's time writing in Riddle's diary.

** *The Accidental Animagus*, linkffn(9863146): excellent world building, smart and rational characters (both heroes and villains). Harry seemed a little too mature at 11, but otherwise believable. The story begins when Harry was 5 and finishes at the end of year 4. The sequel *Animagus at War* is coming in a few weeks. An interlude called *The World of The Accidental Animagus*, linkffn(12076644), depicts the worldwide response to events at the end of Year 4.

  A series of one-shots in the Animagus-Verse showing the state of the magical world at the time of Voldemort's return. Some brace for war, while for others, life goes on. A bridge between The Accidental Animagus and Animagus at War.

** Linkffn(the pureblood pretense) has a second year sequel.

Linkffn(harry potter and the Prince of slytherin) does the second year.

What I think is white squirrel's better work, although I am reading both, linkffn(the arithmancer) has a pretty good second year as well.

  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.
