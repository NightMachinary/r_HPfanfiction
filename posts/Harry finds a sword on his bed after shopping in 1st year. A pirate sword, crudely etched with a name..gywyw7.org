Pirates of The Caribbean crossover. My premise is that Jack fell in love with a Potter daughter for the Potter wildness and relentlessly Gryffindor (not that he'd know what that means) approach to life that is so similar to his, minus the piracy (or not... I can totally see a Pirate Potter being a thing).
