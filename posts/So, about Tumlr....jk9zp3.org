I was hoping someone can tell me what to do with this problem I have right now. I don't have a tumblr account, but I love to see different works about different fandoms in my phone. However, lately I have been incapable of see anything because of the privacy page that opens at the beginning. I'm okay with the first, but afterwards another one opens, with as all these options, like " associates", " legitimate interest" and many other options. It doesn't matter how I agree with their terms, it just returns me to the same page over and over and over again, leaving me unable to see anything in tumblr. Any idea what can I do to fix it, please anyone?


** Unfortunately, you'll probably have to get an account. I don't know how to fix it any other way, I'm afraid, and I know getting an account on most things fixes pop-up issues like that.

**** Try [[/r/tumblr][r/tumblr]]

Just a guess, I don't know.

****** I don't think that you can change it. I think you have to repost it on the proper subreddit. You can delete this post if you need to.
