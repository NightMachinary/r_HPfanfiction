** The big issue with many friends is that you have to write each as a person and not just as a tool for the MC to use. And writing a large group of people is very difficult (dialogue is hell to write without spamming dialogue tags). Don't get me wrong, it is certainly possible to write a large group of people interacting on a regular basis, but if you want to flesh them out to more than "friend of Harry, related to X important person", you run into trouble very soon. People are more than their interactions with a single person and one character trait. Far too often all of Harry's "friends" have no life on their own, being reduced to the "Herbology/Runes/Magizoology role" and are nothing besides that role.

*** I think DPSW is running into trouble in that regard. The author has done a great job managing it thus far, but there are so many irons in the fire that something has to give.

Daphne is certainly more than just a political tool as the author has made her rather rounded. Between the shopping trip and her love for adventure she seems real.

The interactions between Alex and Luna are perhaps my favourite within the story, making both feel alive and believable even if they are young.

It may be hard to do, but when done well is very satisfying.

**** I haven't read DPSW, but it is a trend I noticed in a lot of stories with harems/many characters. For example, Susan becomes a messenger so that Harry can communicate with her aunt, Luna the press girl, Daphne the one for politics, Fleur for everything French and so on.

** Linkffn(The Mind Arts by Wu Gang)

Smart, studies, makes friends with a few (Turpin Greengrass, Granger). My favourite currently updating fic, highly recommend. Characterizations are very well done, no bashing and generally believable.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Cannon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.

  Even muggles notice thousands dead, and Margaret Thatcher had the help of one Sergeant Prewett of Her Majesty's Special Air Service. Harry Potter is taken in by a loving family, and raised to become the hero of both worlds. Even as he enters Hogwarts looking for friends, he is confronted by the darkness in the wizarding world. Now complete! Sequel: Nymphadora Tonks: The Last Auror.
