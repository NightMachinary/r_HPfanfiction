Just like the title says. I want a believable H/Hr pairing in the story, but I don't want it to be the main thing the story focuses on. I like long stories. Also no Robst, his stories are painful to read.


** Okay, so I totally agree with robst being a pretty terrible writer... or at least formulaic to a fault. Guilty pleasures from the HP fanfiction equivalent of Harlequin Romance novels aside...

The filters found only one decent looking story where it doesn't look like romance is the main focus. My criteria in the search specifically excluding romance tags And robst was like 60% of the stories. That guy is PROLIFIC. It's like if Stephen King decided to write harry potter fanfiction.

ANYWAY, here's the thing I found. Full disclosure: I haven't read this myself, so... Not my fault if is bad.

#+begin_quote
  Death wants free of its Master and proposes sending Harry back in time to avoid the unnecessary deaths in fighting Voldemort. Harry readily accepts, thinking he'll start anew as a Firstie. Instead, Harry's soul, magic, and memories end up at the beginning of Second Year --- in GILDEROY LOCKHART!
