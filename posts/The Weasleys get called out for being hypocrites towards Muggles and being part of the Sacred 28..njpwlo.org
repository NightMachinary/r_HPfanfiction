** 1) Being willing to marry into a foreign culture is not a requirement for believing that members of that culture have human rights.

2) Bill married a quarter-Veela. Ron married a muggle-born. Ginny married a half-blood. We don't know the blood status of Angelina Johnson or Audrey, Percy's wife, but there are still at least three pairs there whose children would not be pure-bloods, and Arthur and Molly give no indication of caring about that.

**** So you're bigoted against people with bad ancestors? Cool.

Also, even the Sacred 28 aren't necessarily “inbred” in a deleterious manner (whether they're “inbred” at all depends on how loosely you use the term). The Malfoys are Sacred 28, and yet they've married Half-Bloods.

** Why should they be seen as hypocrites? They weren't a part of the making of the Sacred 28, right? And why would they marry muggles? They are following the Statute of Secrecy, so they can't marry muggles.

****** Finnigans aren't a prominent pureblood family, plus she didn't tell the father about being a witch for a while. Again, you can keep what abouting all you want. Doesn't really matter

******** Thats probably true, but you could say that about most things. For example, a lot of people in the UK were probably pretty racist during the peak of imperialism, where they were told they were the alpha race

My bad, I extrapolated the part about it being illegal to marry non magical people, that's only true in the US according to WW. It's merely frowned upon in Europe
