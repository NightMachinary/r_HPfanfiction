  When one looks into the void of space they see the wonders of the cosmos. But some make the mistake of peering too far into the abyss and find the ones who gaze back. Read as Harry Potter stumbles across a secret that could destroy not only his world, but the entire universe. (Astrology Harry)(Eventual Boss level Harry)
