** The preserve the timeline shit annoys me to no end.. everything they do, from how they talk, to whom, when, words used, everything is going to change the timeline in random ways. And then all they do is rehash canon, and then its just boring on top of being illogical.. :(

*** More than that, their whole character changes and people notice. Yet when the plot-stop comes, they all act the same like the relationships between characters, perception of each character and everything are the same.

Only time "preserve the timeline" shit could work is if they didn't preserve it aat the first do-over and had to go back to stop themselves from messing with the timeline without their two versions waking up to the actions of the third mc.

** This is a major rant about Time Travel fic in general.

The We Must preserve he timeline frustrate me since they don't really follow it. Like, I must not tell... Then tells them either way. Everything they do is shaped by their experience. Especially in Marauders Era, they treat Peter like shit or not write him, then all of sudden Peter hatches a plan against them. A fight ensues with the friends Then things will be right and dandy in the future.

Someone else jumping to the past as if his action hadn't changed the future. Like people following the time traveler, if traveler change the future, people don't just remember alternate future and decide let's follow this guy. The future is altered those people do not exist anymore despite them still being the same. Or even, "I remember we are friends, we are okay again, let's pick up where we left off".

Another is I must not change the future, but invest in future successful companies instead. Economy does not work like that. Sure, it might work for a while, but if you buy shares, the person who would have bought it buys something else, it could give the competition the needed boost. Or it could prevent the said person from getting the money(income) needed. But they still insist, I must not change the timeline.

How everyone just accepted that the person is a time traveler and "ah, it makes sense" and that's the end of it. No one questions it. In fact, one could just fucking say they are a time traveler and people believe him instead of getting a Luna or trelawney treatment or regarded sceptically.

in the prisoner of Azkaban, their whole time traveling is inevitable. there are specific rule to follow. That their time travel is supposed to happen, has happened, will happen. Harry's prophecy is self fulfilling. The prophecy happens despite Tom riddle tries to prevent it. So I believe that inevitable fate is a fact in HP universe it's just that things don't happen as you expect it to go. Or time is self correcting.

*** Partially-Kissed Hero has the MC's blown up in an explosion involving time turners and the Goblet of Fire, and then they get new, nigh-indestructible fairy bodies. Dunno how far they got with it though. I stopped reading after Snape and Dumbledore's fifth on-screen respawn. I guess that's what I'd consider a peeve, the antagonists being as immortal as they are impotent.
