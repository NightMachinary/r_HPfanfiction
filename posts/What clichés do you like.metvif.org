  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

#+begin_quote
  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1978, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter.

  If Harry Potter could alter the past, he isn't sure what he'd change, but he knows he'd change something. If Severus Snape could hold history in his hands, he knows exactly what shape he would mold it into. Albus Dumbledore might flatter himself enough to think he would walk away from such power. But Delphi Riddle isn't here to serve any of them. (Rating for some really prolific cursing and very little else.)

** Yeah, probably gonna get downvoted for this, but...

I like Snape mentoring a young Harry. Like he pulls his head out of his ass early in the series (or even pre-Hogwarts) and realizes that Harry's childhood has not been rosy and that he needs somebody who cares.

Canon Snape was an absolute dickhead, no arguments there. But he could have been so much more if JKR wasn't so invested in making him an unmitigated bastard.

(Fun fact: JKR said, in an interview after book 5, that she was amazed anybody liked Snape or Draco. Suddenly, book 6 starts with them both ratcheting up the brutality. Coincidence? I think not! It's like she was trying to force everybody to hate them because she wanted the "reveals" in book 7 to have more impact, but what she did is make those alleged mitigations /not matter/.)

Before anyone attacks me, yes I do think they are ridiculous and outlandish caricatures of the canon characters, but when i was younger I liked to read them all the time. now a days I like to read them for a good laugh.

**** Yep, when Harry has his ‘big realisation' and it's basically a big chapter of the author ranting about how each canon event up to the point Harry happens to be at (usually 5th year summer) is Dumbledore/Ron's fault. It's disguised as Harry's thoughts but it's clearly the author going on a big lecture lol.

** Sirius being the stereotypical gay guy and Remus being the stereotypical bi guy. I dont know when it started or why i like ot so much, but i saw it in so many fanfics. Sirius with high heels, leather jacket and make-up while he proudly swings the gay flag. Remus wearing jeans jackets mit way too much pins, cuffed jeans and flannel shirts around the waist, lets not foret that he cant sit right and makes finger guns when ever he has the chance.
