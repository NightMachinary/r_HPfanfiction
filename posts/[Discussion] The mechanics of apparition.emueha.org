So, apparition is an interesting piece of magic. But for all it's potential and utility, I rarely see any fics or even discussion around how it might work. I realise that there isn't much canon information on it beyond the '3Ds' and Side-Along apparition, so we're stepping into the realm of headcanon, fanon, speculation and guesses. However, I think we can work a few things out if we put our heads together.

One of the main things I was thinking about was how was it stumbled across? Did someone work towards it as an idea way back when in 2000 BCE? Or did someone eventually manage to replicate it from a piece of accidental magic without splinching themselves into an early grave? Considering how its taught, I find it likely to be closer to my second example. In book 6 the first 'success' is when one of the students splinches themselves. If a student, who had professionals and teachers guiding them through the process, managed to splinch themselves, then it seems unlikely that apparition emerged into the general wizarding public until quite late.

But that's just my baseline thoughts on this, how do you think apparition cropped up? And under what loose 'mechanisms' can we suggest it operates under?

Cheers


** There's "Searching for the Power", not gonna link it, because Rule8. Harry sums it up as intent-based wandless magic that swaps one position with another. He even experiments and finds out the signature crack sound that happens is the displacement of air. And he goes on to prove that if you keep your magic close to your skin instead of a sphere around you, you aparate soundlessly. And reappear naked. Then he had to expand the magic to surround his clothes too. For clothed soundless apparation.

** My initial suspicion is that apparition was discovered from seeing magical children do it accidentally and then asking them about it.

** There's a bit of discussing how it works in The Arithmancer, that I think does a pretty good job.
