Hey, im wondering if any of you have similar fics with You're the Antidote for Me in mind. The fic is soulmate!AU, with heavy angst, but it ended happily. Anything with delicious angst and happy ending, really. It doesn't have to be Drarry. Thank you!

** My favourite of this type (not soulmate, but Harry must love Draco or Draco would die) is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22431970/chapters/53596558][The Bucket List]] - it's absolutely delightful. I actually found you're the antidote for me through this fic, which the writer said inspired them. I also just finished [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13826685][A Hag, a Hex, a Tale of Redemption]], which has a similar premise and is also fantastic. There's also [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4230765][Somebody to Love]], but it seems like it's hidden right now because of a challenge.

There was also [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPSlashFic/comments/g8tc9w/fics_similar_to_the_bucket_list/][a post]] from [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]] (where you're better off posting slash requests) with similar fics recced that you can check out!

*** Thank you! I've read The Bucket List, GallaPlacidia is a miracle. I'll check the rest, and definitely will go to the subreddit you recommended!

  When Draco Malfoy falls into a cursed sleep and can only be woken -- at least, according to the Daily Prophet, that impeccable source of truth -- by â€˜true love's kiss', Harry Potter knows there's no way on earth he's the answer to this particular riddle. Is he . . .?
