Hey guys, I've really gotten into 'the characters read the books fics' recently, but I'm kinda tired of them all petering out by the first or second year. I'd really like to read one that gets to, or starts off with, the seventh book.

I don't really mind if it's not an actual 'they read the book'. Things like, 'they watched it in pensieve' work for me too. As long as it lies in that sort of vein, I'd be happy to read it.
