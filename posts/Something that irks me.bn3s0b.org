Fics where characters change their appearance to look better.\\
I've seen it happen in quite a few fics (Snape related, especially) where they end up changing their appearance by means of some sort of magical plastic surgery. Can someone explain to me why some writers do this? It never seems to add anything of significance to the story other than making them look better in your own imagination.


** Thats... pretty much it.

If you don't like something about yourself that can very easily be fixed with a painless charm (or even if you have to suffer a bit but are happy about it for the rest of your life), why not?

There's an entire industry built around exactly that. Sure there's some actual medical reasons behind it, but ya.

** People can't stand the idea of their self inserts being ugly.

I'm only being a little bit flippant - people generally find it easier to relate and sympathise to attractive people.

** Oh man, especially dark!trio. Harry suddenly growing up to a foot, hermione filling out and her hair changing, third member or choice: Ron, Ginny, Neville, draco, bulking up or generally becoming more attractive. Why.

Like I get that people have their own insecurities and things they wish they could fix but why do it (especially if it's not plot related) for characters that are already mostly considered attractive in universe?

*** Doesn't Harry in canon grow up to a foot between books 5 and 6 anyway?

** I guess it's a logical extension of the magical world.

In a world where anything is possible, isn't it almost masochistic to retain flaws of any kind? When everyone around you is by definition superhuman, isn't it limiting - and perhaps negative for self-esteem - if you go on, flaws and all? It may be an in-group culture or similar.

** I remember one fic where it's done to fool the thief's downfall and other polyjuice detection methods. Basically a wanted death eater (Barty Crouch Jr I think) imperiused a surgeon to change his looks without magic so he wouldn't be found.

** I've actually only seen 2 fics where someone deliberately changes their appearance permanently, and neither of them was to look better, but rather to create a new identity (Harry distancing himself from his father's appearance to get away from the BWL moniker, becoming "Harold Evans", and Severus creating a new identity for the purpose of starting from scratch in befriending Lily, becoming "Sam").
