** Readers praise my dialogue, so maybe it's up to your standards. All my characters have distinctive voices. Here's a sample, a phone conversation set in 1927. Tom Riddle (Voldemort's muggle dad) is trying to patch his life back together after Merope's death, but his beloved Cecilia Threepworple won't take him back. His friend Algie, a muggle OC, is trying to cheer him up. I researched 1920s slang to create Algie's voice.

Tom picked up the telephone receiver and put it to his ear. “Hello?”

“Tom! What ho! How's the ticker tape running?”

“Hello Algie. It's good to hear from you.”

“What's this I heard about you wearing a manacle?”

“You heard right. I did get married. To a Merope Gaunt, a local girl, from a family with no fortune or title.”

“That's surprisingly sensible of you,” said Algie. “A sweet wildflower, not one of these hothouse orchids you usually go for.”

“Yes. Well.”

“Or perhaps I should say Venus flytrap. Congratulations on breaking free of that Threepworple girl. She's a terror.”

“Now Algie, we may no longer be on such close terms, but I won't have you speaking ill of Miss Threepworple.”

“That's mighty big of you, Tom. Anyway, I'm glad you found a proper wife. What did you say her name was again?”

“Merope Gaunt.”

“Interesting name, Merope. Distinctive. I don't want to cast aspersions on anyone's ancestry, but with a name like that, one suspects her parents of being poets. Can't blame a girl for that, though. I'm sure she's wonderful. One look at her rosy, dimpled cheeks, her innocent smile as she herded the geese out to pasture one dewy morning, and you were smitten, no doubt.”

“Something like that.”

“Oh Tom, you're so lucky. You should see the girls my family's trying to set me up with. The last one looked like a horse and asked me what I thought of the coal miners' strike. Can you imagine having an opinion about something so dull?

“Well, it did unsettle the markets.”

“That's right, that is the sort of tale that sets your heart aflutter. Anyway, when do I get to meet this sweetheart of yours?”

“I can't say. Merope and I had a little over a year of married bliss and then---“ Tom let his voice break “---she died. Giving birth to our son. On New Year's Eve.”

“What was that? This connection's a bit crackly.

Tom was irritated to have to repeat his performance, and ran through it faster the second time. It got through.

“Nerts!” exclaimed Algie. “Well, that's blaah, isn't it?”

“Yes.”

If you like that sort of thing, the story's here:

#+begin_quote
  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

** I'm curious - what do you regard as realistic speech? Like, properly Brit-picked, period-appropriate slang and meter, etc?

*** Speech where they're actually british. Some good british humor and in general just characters where they say what normal people would say given their situation.

Like appropriate reactions or appropriate word choice? (sorry for all the questions, but I wanted to make sure I knew exactly what you were looking for).

****** Cool. Thanks for answering - I'll check through my bookmarks and see what I can find.

I'd recommend looking into some threads on this sub about well 'brit-picked' stories. That'll probably get you a lot of what you want.

(If you're not familiar with the term, 'brit-picked' means it's been gone over to make sure the language and references used are proper 80s-90s appropriate British.)

Though if you're looking for a Harry that tells people how Hogwarts is 'lit, fam' (or anything from more modern slang), then you probably won't find much. I've certainly never seen the term used in a fic, though I've only been semi-active in the fandom for a few months now. They're more likely to attempt slang like Wicked and Tight and Jammy that was actually used in the 90s.

** Disregarding the fact that what is and isn't realistic in fiction is incredibly hard to define, speech patterns even more so. It is quite subjective. Also Realism=/=Reality...

No offense intended... but...

Do some people just forget that they are reading FANfiction? Like, what do you expect? Even many professional writers have a hard time with natural speech patterns. Hell, J.K. Rowling herself can be criticized for this on some points. Ex. who the hell says 'snogging' instead of 'kissing'?
