Iâ€˜m looking for a fic/series of fics that are basically a continuation of the books (including the epilogue, but definitely excluding lost child). I've read little0bird and some Northumbrian, so something along those lines, and I prefer longer stories (like little0bird) rather than a bunch of short ones.


** Melindaleo on ffnet has a fabulous trilogy that she is currently writing book 3 of!

** Have you read Slytherin's Potter? [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6551834/1/Slytherin-s-Potter]] It follows Lily Potter as she's sorted into Slytherin throughout all her Hogwarts years and beyond. It's definitely my favourite post canon/next-gen story line.
