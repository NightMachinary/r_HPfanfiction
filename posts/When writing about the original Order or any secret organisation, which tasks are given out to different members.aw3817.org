For example, you have your spies, intelligence officers, people who form alliances, aurors/fighters and maybe healers. But what else is there? For example, we know Dung Fletcher brings information from the dredges of the Wizarding World but what does Elphias Doge do for example? Emmeline Vance? Dorcas Meadowes? Benjy Fenwick? What other positions in an organisation are there?


** I tend to split it by time contraints and availability. For the most major Ren, for example, we have our up front fighters and our behind the scenes people (which is nicknamed the ravenclaw rebellion) but we also have Remus in a teaching role for other Order members, Emmeline is an Unspeakable so she handles more of that, Hestia a healer, Dedalus is a lawyer, etc.

If we were examining it going back to the original order, I tend to break it down into these categories and people who are busy or injured can switch up to doing less up front things too. They're what I would say are Order activities, besides full on battles.

*Recruitment*·(or why are we letting a bunch of kids into the tree house anyway?) Surveilling potential expansion candidates for the Order. · Intervening in the case of Death Eater Recruitment or blackmail.

*Anti·Voldemort Propaganda* (and the occasional destruction of Pro·Voldemort Propaganda) · Supporting a free, inclusive wizarding world. · Broadcasting of the core ideals of freedom and peace keep it in the forefront of peoples minds. · Focus on bringing to light what is just prejudice and rumour as opposed to fact. · Promoting blood equality. · Providing rational reasons, laws and quotes to support the cause.

*Reconnaissance* (or how to look for suspected Death Eaters and not die horribly) · Surveilling hot spots to see who meets (bar jobs?) · Seeing who the Death Eaters are watching as potential recruits and intervening if necessary. · Checking muggle papers and radio for signs of an unnoticed Death Eater attack. · Recording unexpected events or movements from people · Check the movements of the suspected/confirmed · Looking at known associates of the already suspected · Checking on internal and external security during recruitment

*Research & Development* (also known as “can we invent something that does this” and “i hope someone has made pepper·up potion this week”) · Background check ups on people of note · Magical research and invention (portkeys or charming things, for example) · Development of potions for offensive/ healing purposes

*Strategy & Planning* (or how, when, where and what are we doing with this information) · Identifying Death Eater attacks (from rumour, from the papers, from radio and passing the information on) and what to do about them · Identifying workable plans from the insane ideas · Internal problems within the Order itself · Analysis of recon

*Espionage* (disguising yourself as two house elves in a trench coat) · Looking at the DMLE mask profiles assigned to each crime and comparing with own data · Integration of spies and protocol for handling · Breaking & entering for recon purposes

*Education & Information* (or what does this curse do and how long is it going to be like that) · Letting people know the truth via Anti·Voldemort propaganda · Treating wounds, hexes and curses · Protective spellwork & how vital it is for your home to be protected · Identifying potions and tricky spells quickly for battle · Education on and defense against Dark Creatures · How to raise the alarm

For some weird reason, reddit is refusing to let me bullet point these so hopefully it's readable.

**** I'm afraid not. We keep extensive notes like this, maps, residences, etc so they can be referred to in our canon.

** I always imagine the order as an information gathering organisation more so than a combat force. I imagine that members are spread out over the ministry and other organisations (i.e. ICW, St. Mungo's) and keep their ears open. We also have the likes of Lupin and Hagrid that make contact with groups like the Werewolves and Giants. I imagine similar liaisons might exist for other groups (vampires for instance).

*** Yeah, given how little manpower they have (even in the "full Order" picture), they cannot sustain a prolonged campaign against an enemy who liberally uses lethal force. By the end of the series, you have Kingsley, a few Weasleys and possibly Hestia Jones. And that's after just one proper battle.
