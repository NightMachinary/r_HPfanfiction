Sorry if this formats wrong. I'm desperate to find this fix as it was brilliant and I can't seem to find it no matter what I search!

I'm looking for a fanfiction that I read a 2/3 years back. It's a Harry Potter fanfiction set after the war. Hermione is severely depressed and tries to cast an Avada Kedavra or Crucio on herself. I'm pretty sure it's the Crucio and she does it directly in her forehead. Hermione, Harry, Ginny, Luna & Blaize are defibetly together in the same class. { think} More like a group that focuses on emotional healing. There's a new teacher just for the 7/8th years that choose to come back. She's mod eof a free spirit/hippy The crucio she cast on herself is killing her and she needs everyone's help I think.

******* Don't worry, you have nothing to be sorry about although I will take this opportunity to warn people that the rewrite appears to be abandoned as well
