Sorry for the bad language as English is not my first language... Do let me know if there is anything I can improve further ...

#+begin_quote
  Molly had already prepared a delicious 4 course meal
#+end_quote

Personally I write out any number below 1000. So,

#+begin_quote
  Molly had already prepared a delicious four-course meal
#+end_quote

Just looks a lot better in my opinion. (The hyphen belongs in there, but as English is your second language I wouldn't worry too much about it.)

#+begin_quote
  After the dinner, Harry stood up and hit the wine glass with spoon to get everyone's attention.
#+end_quote

"Hit" is a strong word. "Tapped" is much closer to what you're trying to convey here. I'm also pretty sure the comma is unneeded. Could look like this:

#+begin_quote
  After dinner was finished Harry stood up and tapped his wine glass with a spoon to get everyone's attention.
#+end_quote

Next

#+begin_quote
  When he was sure that he was looking at him, he began.
#+end_quote

Minor error, should be

#+begin_quote
  When he was sure that they were looking at him, he began.
#+end_quote

But began what?

#+begin_quote
  When he was sure that they were looking at him, he began his prepared speech.
#+end_quote

Maybe?

#+begin_quote
  "We all know that James Sirius is proving to be a handful to me and Ginny. I guess he is tough even for Molly to babysit. "
#+end_quote

It's not normal in English to say just the first and middle name, so maybe just say "James" here. Also should be "Ginny and I." as opposed to "me and Ginny."

#+begin_quote
  "He is going to have a sibling in the next 7 months ".
#+end_quote

This mistake happens a few times. The period "." should be inside of the quotation marks, so,

#+begin_quote
  "He is going to have a sibling in the next 7 months."

  "I and Hermione were waiting for the 3 months to cross to announce ours but you stole the moment "
#+end_quote

Should be "Hermione and I" and "three months to pass" instead of cross.

#+begin_quote
  Molly almost shrieked in excitement "is that true?" She asked looking at Hermione.

  Molly almost shrieked in excitement. "Is that true?" she asked, looking at Hermione.

  "Stop being so dramatic, mom"
#+end_quote

People from the United Kingdom call their moms "mum"

#+begin_quote
  "I'm just happy that all my children have a grandchild now."
#+end_quote

I think you mean "all my children have given me grandchildren now."

Overall as English isn't your first language you're doing great. I certainly can't write half as well in any other language.
