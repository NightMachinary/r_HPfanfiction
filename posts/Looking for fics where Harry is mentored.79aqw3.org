Basically anything where someone mentors Harry. Longer fics are best as I want to see his gradual progression from ordinary to extraordinary. Preferably not focused on pairings and also that snape isn't the mentor. Completed stories are better but as long as it isn't abandoned I don't mind if it is unfinished. Much appreciated.


** I feel like I'm recommending these all over the place today haha.

Linkffn(2163835) and the sequel, Linkffn(2460564). Dumbledore mentorship, non-HBP/DH compliant. Both finished (Like... 12 years ago. Lol). First one was finished pre-HBP, and the second was finished pre-DH, so no mention of Hallows or Horcruxes.

I'm not sure how well it stands up over the last decade or so, but The Refiner's Fire is the fic that personally got me into fanfiction.

*** The Refiner's Fire can be a bit cringy at points, and especially with the way tropes are protrayed..but I can heartily recommend it to anyone who likes mentors, drama, and a powerful!Harry.

*** I loved it a couple of years ago when I read it, but man. Harry spends so much time hospitalised for some reason? It's grating

**** That's actually so true lol. I haven't read it since 2005, but I feel like the author was trying to ground the two books? No quick fixes or (pun intended) “magic” cures. That being said... do a timeskip or something. Haha. It's a great two books, but you're absolutely right.

This is a Snape mentors Harry story, where Harry enters into a formal apprenticeship to study Defence under Snape. It's an old story, released before OttP, and so disregards everything after GoF. Takes places post Harry's seventh year.

I like it because it extrapolates on various magics and the character voices are very well done. Unfortunately abandoned.
