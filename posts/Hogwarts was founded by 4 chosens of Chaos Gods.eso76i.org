“Hufflepuff!” Harry looks at the table where Hannah Abott is heading to, where people look like they are covered in pus and vomits and are happily ingesting things that hardly look like food anymore. Yah no wonder someone like Draco would quit if he gets sorted there.

“Ravenclaw!” Terry boot's table looks rather decent at first, but the glint in their eyes and the constant changing expressions and feathers on their bodies make them look very unwelcoming.

“Slytherin!” Draco Malfoy is sorted instantly into Slytherin, where people barely dressed in anything and are indulging in activities that seem very inappropriate even in one of Uncle Vernon's VHS tapes. It does seem like the most fitting house for him.

Harry finally walks towards the stool where the menacing Sorting hat lays on. “Hmmm... Certainly a great deal of desire to indulge in excessiveness and obsession for a Slytherin, but also a decent amount of blood-thirst and appreciation for destruction for a Gryffindor in you. Where should I put you?”

“Not Slytherin” Harry thought, seeing that Draco has already shown him what would happen if he goes to Slytherin. Harry still don't feel like dressing in those clothes.

“Oh? You can certainly become the favorite of Slaanesh, are you sure you don't want to be a Slytherin? Then I guess it is GRYFFINDOR for you!” Harry quickly put down the hat on the stool, and walk straight to the table where the Weasley twins are waving blood stained maces in the air and shouting “We got Potter!”. When he sits down, Dumbledore surreptitiously toasts to him in a goblet that looks like it was made of goblin scalp and filled with human blood.


** This story is pretty warped.
