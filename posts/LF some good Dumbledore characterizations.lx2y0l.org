He doesn't have to be the main character, he can be a minor character or anywhere in between. But I'm tired of reading bashing stories of Dumbledore.

I'd love to see where he is wrong but changes things, but that's not mandatory. I just don't want flat-out bashing.

Characters not liking what he did in canon is one thing, but I'd like for them to come to an understanding of sorts, even if they don't necessarily forgive him.

As for pairings (if there are any). I'm fine with het/slash /femslash, Asexual/Bisexual, etc.

NO Weasley Bashing, as I love that family.

Him being different than canon is fine, just want some interesting Dumbledore characterizations/personalities.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14033613/chapters/32322168][Percy Take the Wheel]] - this very much doesn't focus on Dumbledore, but I still really like how he's depicted here. It's thoughtful, in a way - it talks a bit about how alone Dumbledore is, most of his generation having died, and how few peers he has left to turn to for advice. An interesting take, and one I appreciate. It's certainly refreshing.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

** Dumbledore is a central and POV character in a few of my stories, and he'd rather kill an enemy than endanger an innocent. And while he abhors killing, he'd rather shoulder that burden himself than let others do it.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
