I've been inspired by the Book Club pick this month, which has Alana the Lioness recast as a Harry Potter fanfic. In that spirit, here are some published novels reskinned as Harry Potter fanfics:

AU where Hermione Granger is the Girl Who Lived. Raised by a coven of Seers, she never displays the Sight and thinks that her Inner Eye might be hopelessly clouded. Even worse, as her eleventh birthday approaches, she worries she might even be a squib. Desperate to attend Hogwarts anyways, Hermione takes a job as a library assistant. Can she discover her destiny and the knowledge she needs to defeat the Dark Lord in the labyrinthine bowels of the Hogwarts library? (Lirael by Garth Nix)

***

Cast out of Malfoy Manor for killing a pureblood boy, Draco finds unexpected solace in the arms of the Chosen One. When Voldemort takes the war to new heights, Harry is the only hero strong enough to stop him. But can Draco's love temper Harry's rash thirst for revenge before Harry hurts those he loves? Draco/Harry. Rated M. (Song of Achilles by Madeleine Miller)

***

something something hogwarts is an elite battle school and harry kills lots of people. no pairings. Enders Game.

Okay, I sort of ran out of steam at the end there, but you get the idea...


** Voldemort recovered his body almost immediately with his Death Eaters' help, and largely took over Magical Britain, with the Order of the Phoenix being reduced to an underground resistance movement. Instead of sending Hagrid to give Harry his Hogwarts letter, Dumbledore came in person. But with Harry out of the house, the Death Eaters were able to enter Privet Drive and assassinate the Dursleys. Unable to send him home, and alarmed by the re-escalating violence, Dumbledore instead takes Harry with him to search for the Horcruxes, ultimately sacrificing himself so that Harry can become the master of the Elder Wand and use it to destroy Voldemort's body - for now.

** Heavy AU where Harry grows up in the Muggle world with Dumbledore periodically dropping in as a friend, until - when the Dark Lord rises again - he tells Harry that he has the Dark Lord's horcrux and he must walk to the Mountain of the Basilisk to destroy it. Along the way, Harry will meet new friends, including Neville the rightful King of Wizarding Britain who will meet Dark Lord's current body in battle (no thanks to the competent but self-interested Fudge regency) while Harry secretly destroys the horcrux.

** Harry has escaped the war with Voldemort and now runs a popular club in North Africa. One day, Ron Weasley arrives in town needing his help, and brings with him an old flame: Hermione Granger. Will Harry help Ron or will he seize the chance to rekindle the flames of his old relationship with Hermione?

**** Hmm. I think to pull it off completely you'd have to make it an AU where Voldemort had pretty much won. Then Major Strasse would be someone like Barty Crouch Jr. Ideally Louie would be Percy - siding with whichever side is winning - but that wouldn't work with the Ron thing. Maybe Draco?

** No Voldemort AU. The magical world's masquerade is enforced via barriers and pocket dimensions, outside of which magic is heavily prohibited. Platform 9 3/4 only opens every 9 years, allowing for travel between the worlds for a limited amount of time. When Harry is accidentally left near a horrible Muggle woman who desperately wants a child, he's snatched up for 9 years until a rescue operation can be mounted.

Hagrid, Hermione, Fleur, and Dumbledore all wind up heading to the rescue. Weirdly enough, the Muggle woman's child is fat, lazy, and a bully, while the skinny kid who seems to be stuck doing all her chores instantly strikes up a friendship with the group of rescuers... The Secret of Platform 13, possibly the most Harry Potter-esque book I've ever read, that came out three years before Philosopher's Stone.

** Ginny wakes up with her last memory being a high-speed broom crash, to find her parents telling her that her friends she was flying with are now dead and she only narrowly survived. But, her body now feels strangely different, her memory is full of gaps, and her parents are acting odd and not giving her answers. The disturbing answer she uncovers is that she did die... and her parents restored her from a Horcrux.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.
