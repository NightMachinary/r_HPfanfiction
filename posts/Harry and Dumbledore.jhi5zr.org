Hiya,

I'm looking for any fics that centre around Harry and Dumbledore --- I would prefer mentor fics but anything is better than nothing.

Thanks in advance

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

** Alright --- this is one of my favorite Harry and Dumbledore fanfics ever. So well-written and poignant. The only catch is that it's slash --- Harry/Dumbledore slash lol. But the author does a really good job of justifying and illustrating Harry's inner conflict and angst, it's actually so worth it.
