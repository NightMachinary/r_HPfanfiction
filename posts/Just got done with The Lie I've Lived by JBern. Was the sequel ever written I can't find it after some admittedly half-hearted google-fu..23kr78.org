** It wasn't. I'm honestly kind of glad since his other sequel didn't live up to Bungle in the Jungle.

*** I've been meaning to read Bungle - I've got it bookmarked in my "to read" folder - but for some reason it never seemed to catch my fancy.

**** For me Bungle really picked up and became one of my favorite fics after it got back to where the first chapter started which doesn't happen till chapter 18 or so. It can be a bit hard to get into but I would say it's worth it in the end to stick with it.
