I have already read pretty much everything by Athey.


** linkffn(When Harry Met Wednesday) This is an excellent fic, and the only one I've ever read where I think manipulative!Dumbledore had a point. I'm not even sure I'd really call it a bashing fic.

linkffn(Travel Secrets First) This series claims to bash but I've also never really felt it did. The characters in it are just a bit different from canon, and worthy of being criticized. To me bashing fics are usually pretending to be canon and then exaggerating their faults.

** Who's the most honest crook?

More seriously, linkffn(The Well Groomed Mind) is often touted as one, though that was not my impression. linkffn(Do Onto Others Before They Do Onto You by SmallBurnyThing) has the distinction of hitting almost every one of my non-technical pet peeves (Dumbledore and Weasley bashing, harem, power levels, including powerful!Harry, submissive!Hermione, titles of nobility with magical significance, and so on) but doing it in an interesting and compelling way that nonetheless kept me reading. The linkffn(The Reluctant Lord by SmallBurnyThing) is an amusing fanfic trope pileup along similar lines.

A Dumbledore bashing fic? Its manipulative!Dumbledore definitely, but I dont think theres any bashing. Dumbledore isn't portrayed as dumb, weak, or the whole "Greater Good" every 2 sentences thing. Hes a looming, powerful character in this fic.

***** I guess that's true, though every definition or example of bashing i've read, or heard of includes the character having negative attributes highlighted, or pointed out etc etc. And in The Well Groomed Mind Dumbledore (while kind of evil) definitely doesn't have any negative attributes shown in more detail than Harry seeming to hate him.

******* Hmmm. I see what your saying, but I still think its not bashing. I guess I could just explain it with a analogy better than I can with words:

Bashing: "Ron's always jealous. From our first year at hogwarts it was evident. What did he see when he looked in the Mirror of Erised, himself. He was always using me for fame and to try and leech of my money once he got older and ginny had enslaved me with Amortentia.

Negative Character Trait: "Sure, Ron's a bit jealous, that's been evident since our first year. And yeah, we fought. but hes still a good person, just a bit jealous."

In the essence of fairness, this may have been a bit of an extreme, and it didn't involve Dumbledore at all, but it still gets the message across. I think. The way I see bashing it more has to do with an author either overplaying a few events into a character being extremely something, or its a total character assassination where the author either blows some aspect of a character totally out of proportion without much reason in their fic. It also seems to greatly depend on the tone of the author.

** I think the Dumbledore bashing in *Harry Potter and the Butterfly Effect*, linkffn(9065880), is very well done. That Dumbledore was neither a pacifist nor incompetent, but had his own motivation why he was doing those 'things'.

Edit: just to clarify, bashing is always a sign of bad fiction/writing. It involves the flanderization of whichever character(s) is being bashed and not an interesting or human portrayal. And don't get me wrong, I definitely went through a bashing phase myself, but quite frankly I got around to reading actually good fics and never went back.

  You'll find that Dumbledore Bashing fanfics are mostly terrible :) Why not explore other parts of HPfanfiction?

some people like 'War and Peace'. some like 'Superman' comics. Who is right? How about.. neither are terrible?
