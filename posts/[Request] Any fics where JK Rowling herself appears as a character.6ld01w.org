** There was a request for Harry/Emma Watson a few days ago. I think it would be an interesting concept, and JKR could perfectly appear here.

*** Ok, now I want all the characters to meet their actors. Or better yet, crossovers with movies involving the same actors/actress. Like Hermione meets [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2771200/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_2][Belle]] or Harry meets [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1528071/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_15][Ig Perrish]] or [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3110958/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_6][Walter Mabry]].

**** There is the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10557480/1/Sean-Bean-Saves-Westeros-Book-1-Sean-Lends-a-Hand][Sean Bean Saves Westeros - Book 1: Sean Lends a Hand]], linkffn(10557480), and it's pretty good.

So Harry/Emma can definitely be viable, especially if Emma knows the story.

#+begin_quote
  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.

** Spoilers I guess, but the "Hogwarts: The Real World" has a bit at the end? You can find it in linkao3(Amortentia by olivieblake) - I believe the chapters in the ~30ish range (they're all titled).

  Will they or won't they? Oh, they will. Fluff for when you need it. Romantic short stories, multiple pairings, mostly Dramione but some by request. Includes Bachelorette, Reunion, and The Real World: Hogwarts series.

***** JK Rowling in an interview said:

#+begin_quote
  I mean none of the characters in the books are directly taken from life, but real people did inspire a few of them, but of course, once they are on the page they become something completely different. Yeah, *Hermione is a caricature of what I was when I was 11, a real exaggeration*. I wasn't that clever. Hermione is borderline genius at points and I hope I wasn't that annoying because I would have deserved strangling. Sometimes she's an incredible know-it-all.

******* Actually JK Rowling admitted that Hermoine and Harry were meant to be together.

I think she hooked Ginny and Harry together because if Harry and Hermoine were hooked than Ron (and by extension Ginny) won't have anyone else.
