Is there any fanfic where Harry is a hero like the canon except he /doesn't use magic outwardly./ No, I don't want militant Harry, that shit is done so many times and often by someone with no combat experience.


** Book 1?

I seem to recall someone pointing out that aside from the assume off screen exams, Harry never explicitly casts any spells for all of Philosopher's Stone. Though there may be one or two that I've forgotten.
