** I had a notion like this, in that the victim's soul is used by the killer to empower the horcrux as a soul anchor. Their soul isn't in the afterlife, /yet/. In fact the casting of the killing curse grabs that soul and stows it into the wand that killed them, which is why the spirits of Voldemort's victims were able to arise and act against him, which is well beyond the capabilities of a simple echo.

The problem as pointed out elsewhere, is that Myrtle's ghost still wanders around.

*** The act that is supposed to split the soul is evidently abhorrent beyond any other possibility, so I prefer the idea that the victim's soul is extinguished. Far worse than being temporarily (?) trapped in a wand.

And I don't see how ghosts present a problem in either line of thought; ghosts are left behind by souls taken from life and unwilling to accept it. Whether Myrtle straight up died, or her soul was snuffed out, or stored in a wand or wherever (even though the basilisk killed her), the point is that her soul isn't there anymore. Whether the foot leaves the sand for the water or concrete or grass, there are prints left behind.

I think what happened in the graveyard is perfectly in line with what ghosts can do, though I couldn't definitively label those afterimages as ghosts.

*** Because Myrtle was killed by the Basillisk directly, tom did not kill her himself

**** I meant if the ghost of Myrtle is her actual soul, it can't be in use to bind the diary horcrux together. The only reason I consider the ghost to be the soul is that ghosts can evidently learn things like modern English, people's names and gossip about them and hold onto recent memories. People whose soul have been sucked out by a Dementor don't have those capacities, so I associate memory and personality with the soul.

I have this problem with JKR's worldbuilding in that what people declare as being the case sometimes doesn't logically fit with how these things are portrayed, so I take evidence in action over declarations by characters. For the same reason, I think Dumbledore is wrong about how Tom Riddle handled the murders in Little Hangleton in 1943, given how the Trace actually seems to function. It makes much more sense that Riddle used the Imperius on Morfin Gaunt and made him go up the hill and kill the muggle Riddles. That way his memory of doing so would be accurate and genuine, and the only spell that might have been detected as cast by Tom Riddle would have been cast in the Gaunt's shack, where no doubt the Ministry ignores all spellwork since they're longtime Pureblood residents.

***** I meant to say that `/the act of murder/` is the requirement for creating a horcrux, you don't require a soul for it. The soul of the person, that has been murderd is completely independent from creation of horcrux. You have to `/kill someone so that it rips apart your own soul/`. Creating a horcrux does not require any kind of soul of the person you killed, it requires your own soul to be split. You have to murder someone and whatever happens to victim, whether they become a ghost or their soul goes to a different realm, is completely different story and in no way is it related to the horcrux creation.

And traces have always been described very loosely in the books, not to say that it has be illogical or out of place. As for the Imperius curse, Tom has always been very careful in using unforgivables during his years at hogwarts. Otherwise he would have just gone around killing Muggle borns with the killing curse instead of using a Basillisk. It really makes sense for Tom to put Morfin under Imperius and then make him kill the muggles, but it would be too risky for him.

Agree with this. I think the symbolic aspect of making horcruxes is /self-destruction/ (or rather, self-mutilation). It's all about the /creator/ of the horcrux and his/her soul, what he/she is doing to bring about the death, and how those actions affect him/her, /not the victim./ That isn't to say the victim has /no/ importance in the process:

Dumbledore says in HBP:

#+begin_quote
  "He seems to have reserved the process of making Horcruxes for particularly significant deaths..."
#+end_quote

Significant to whom? To the /creator/ of the horcrux. My guess is that the spell(s) that create a horcrux probably require the deaths to be significant* to the caster so that the soul is more receptive to manipulation (more emotional) upon being split.

*It could be argued that the fact that Tom used an Albanian peasant (diadem) and a muggle tramp (locket) shows that the deaths /do not/ have to be important to the caster. My response would be that the creation of multiple horcruxes probably deviates significantly from the original intended purpose and method. The first horcrux - the first instance of self-mutilation of the soul - is probably the most complicated and painful instance. Additionally, the soul is permanently damaged, potentially leaving it unstable. Subsequent horcruxes would become easier to create as there is less of a need to be in an intense emotional state in order to access the soul. This in turn would make the murder less important as well to the overall process.

******* What you say actually makes. It sucks really bad that we did not get to know about the story of any person who created horcrux other than Tom. It was also just mentioned that Herpo the foul was responsible for creating the first horcrux. But from what I could understand through slughorns conversation with Tom, it seems that there may have been potentially other people who have tried to create horcrux and have been successful. I really wished JK put more stories around people trying to create horcruxes.

And I believe the '*reserved for significant people*' might have meant more for choosing certain kind of people that fit his tastes. Not that it changes how much a murder weighs for the person. Because I believe Tom never really had much hesitation in killing people, it's all the same for him. For Tom how important a murder is, might depend on the target person and it's safe to assume he is trying to pick the fanciest murders for creating a horcrux, just like how he chose priceless objects as his horcrux vessel.

*** Ghosts aren't souls, they're imprints that are left behind by magical souls that pass on.

So its not necessarily a problem and her soul could be in Voldemort's wand, while a Ghost of her is still wandering around.

** Not sure, how does it work for Myrtle. She did decide to haunt Olive Hornby, and whatever soul is, I guess she needed it for such decision.

*** Snape defined ghosts as being the imprint of a departed soul. Going by that, could be they're more of an echo or a memory of the person rather than anything to do with the actual soul.

***** I think there would. The soul was there, and then it wasn't, and that untimely transition is what leaves the lasting impression ghosts embody. It seems all the same to me whether the soul departs through death or extinction.

***** Not necessarily. If a ghost is just an imprint of a soul, that implies that it's not the actual soul and the soul itself had moved on. In that case, a soul being trapped could likely still leave behind an imprint.

** Lily's soul probably "survived" due to the botched creation. I think that if her soul was annihilated, Harry wouldn't have been protected.

That being said, with that exception out of the way, this is an interpretation I've seen once, and also the most horrific one. Similar to a Dementor's Kiss.

EDIT: Thinking on it a bit more, I doubt Voldemort used Lily as the sacrifice at all since his initial plan was to save her. If anything I expected him to have used Harry. This might actually explain the botched Horcrux creation that still partially succeeded despite the AK counter.

** I have a weird concept about deaths in harry potter.

The death of Myrtle is completely different from every other horcrux victim. Myrtle was directly killed by the basillisk under tom's orders but tom did not kill Myrtle himself, whereas everyone else was killed by the Avada Kedavra directly by tom. I have heard from somewhere (a very loose theory), that you cannot become a ghost if you are killed through the Avada Kedavra. In Harry potter universe, if someone kills you through a knife or something, you can become a ghost and then testify yourself for your murder, but the killing curse makes sure such a thing doesn't happen. That is why the killing curse is considered so dangerous.

And your theory of soul sacrifice wont work. In memory that harry gets from Slughorn, it is mentioned that murder of someone will split your soul (regardless of whether you want to make a horcrux or not) into two. Horcrux happens to be a type of magic that allows you to embed this part-soul into an object, while your original soul keeps residing in your body. Horcrux allows you to take advatage of your murder, not that it directly requires some kind of soul sacrifice.
