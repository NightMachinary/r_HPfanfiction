As long as possible. I don't love dark Harry. If him and Draco could be friends that would be a bonus.

Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin is an ongoing Slytherin!Harry story which also incorporates the concepts of WBWL and a living Lily and James. It's incredibly fun and has tons of great worldbuilding!

***** Signed. The author actually struggled a bunch with that first chapter, kept revising it because he thought it was driving readers away. The actual story is great.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][On the Way to Greatness]] linkffn(4745329) - the best Slytherin!Harry fic out there for my money, even though it's unfinished, because everyone's kept in character and is thoughtful about the realities of Harry being in Slytherin, especially after Voldemort returns. Gen.

The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/331576][Serpensortia]] trilogy, starting with linkao3(4913998) - the only other Slytherin!Harry fic I've liked enough to reread, because it also keeps Harry pretty true to his canon characterization. Gen.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1140833][Ut Malis Melior]] - this series is fantastic. Only, there are friendly Slytherins but Draco is not one of them. It's a great series though.

** I've said it before, but I really love this fic and someone already mentioned Prince of Slytherin (though with a mobile link).

linkffn(7613196)

It's a female Harry with no pairings. The first three books are complete and the fourth is ongoing. It starts a bit slow, but it's really good and I love it. Give it a chance when you have time. There is no mad terrorist Voldemort, but there is a cunning and ruthless politician Tom Riddle. Harry is friends with Draco and Pansy.
