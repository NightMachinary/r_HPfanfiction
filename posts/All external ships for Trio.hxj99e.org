:END:
Does anybody know about stories with non-Harmony/non-Romione ships (but still Hinny), i.e., something like ({} means “either/or”):

- Hinny
- Hermione/{Fred,George}
- Ron/{Luna,Lavender}

(if Ron/Lavender, it is meant seriously, not just the canonical HBP disaster; if HBP-compliant, Ron's change of heart after being poisoned doesn't lead to chucking Lavender, but to reconstruction of their relationship to something more healthy and serious)


** Golden Bullets shows a Ron/Lavender relationship in a nice way (nicer than canon at least). I wish I knew of more fics like that, since I really wish there hadn't been any pairing within the trio

*** I know about linkao3(18935341), but it seems to me it just replaces very common Ron bashing with Hermione bashing, I am not sure whether it is much improvement. I mean, yes, what Hermione did was wrong, but to make her into the worst person which ever walked the Earth (which I feel the story is doing) is a wee bit too much. We all were sixteen ones, and if there are no things you regret from the age of sixteen, it usually means you are not seventeen yet, I am afraid.
