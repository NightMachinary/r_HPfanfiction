I must be dumber than I thought, but I haven't understood any story written by this person. My latest attempt was with October and I just don't understand... I became exhausted just reading.

Around here I've read that that's something called absurdism, but I was never good at the literary part of languages.

What I need is someone explaining to me how I should approach reading these stories, thanks.


** I think I was the one who mentioned it last time, so I'll expand with a passage from wikipedia:

#+begin_quote
  While a great deal of absurdist fiction may be humorous or irrational in nature, the hallmark of the genre is neither comedy nor nonsense, but rather, the study of human behavior under circumstances (whether realistic or fantastical) that appear to be purposeless and philosophically absurd. Absurdist fiction posits little judgment about characters or their actions; that task is left to the reader. Also, the "moral" of the story is generally not explicit, and the themes or characters' realizations --- if any --- are often ambiguous in nature. Additionally, unlike many other forms of fiction, absurdist works will not necessarily have a traditional plot structure (i.e., rising action, climax, falling action, etc.).

So basically, Lily, the main character, is not there to solve the problem. Lily, the main character, /is/ the problem. How she acts and reacts, how she views the world, and how she breaks every possible law of magic and nature, despite how impossibly absurd it should be. Carnivorous Muffin isn't writing a typical Beginning>Conflict>Climax>Ending story, he's writing a story exploring Lily's own viewpoint and character growth. And since Lily has her own metaphysical logic, the story follows it and leaving all the other characters behind in the dust, struggling to make sense of it all.

In simplest terms, it's not a grand fantasy epic. It's a character study of what happens when you put a god among the little people. Of all the characters, not just Lily.

*** I second the above comment and add what I had written before looking down and realizing someone already got the point across.

Carnivorous muffin does not write a story to get to a destination carnivorous muffin writes about a journey with no destination. there is no beginning middle end there are the points in between. the stories are not about defeating the big bad or doing the thing but about the main character who may or may not do the thing and may or may not beat the big bad. its like how there are some parts of one piece where the plot does not advance but it's okay because you're a moron if the plot is why you watch one piece, one piece is about the adventure and the character involved with some plot advancement to keep it on track. carnivorous muffins big bads and things to do are not about doing the thing or beating the big bad, they exist to keep the journey on track and show the characters involved.

tldr: it's about the journey, not the destination.

** How to approach carnivorous muffins works?

I really like them, but if you're not enjoying them then don't read them.

I'd rec lily and the art of being Sisyphus over October, as it updates more often.

What you need to know is that the plot isn't that super important, it's that there's a type of humour in having an all powerful being inhabit the body of a little girl. Lily doesn't need to go to hogwarts because she can reshape reality, but she does because it might be more narratively fulfilling.

In a typical story harry sees an obstacle, works out how to overcome it, then overcomes it. Lily removes the obstacle with a wave of her hand and doesn't understand why everyone else doesn't.
