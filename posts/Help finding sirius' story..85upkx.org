See some months ago i read this love story about sirius and oc where as much as i remember last chapter i had read had lily telling the oc(i guess she was a slytherin or related to them, just acquintance of lily though) about telling the slytherins -avery, etc about the play and betraying themand oc just accepted it whereas she didn't give out the play but she couldn't stop her slytherin fellow even after he told her. So basically she spoiled her friendship with sirius, and other marauders. Lily even told her that if their (marauders) friendship meant so less to her that she isn't even clearing the misunderstanding. It was mostly on wattpad. Please help.


** Anyways, i found it. It's fragile things.
