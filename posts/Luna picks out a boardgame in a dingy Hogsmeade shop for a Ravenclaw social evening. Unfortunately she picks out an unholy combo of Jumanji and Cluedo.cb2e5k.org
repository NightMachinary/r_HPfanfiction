** Even if you just kept it to Jumanji - forbidden first edition, that would be enough.

Don't set it in Ravenclaw though. Luna doesn't mingle with them. Make it a DA social evening... with no one sure if it's the game doing it or if the Room of Requirement has suddenly decided to play too..

Ron is freaking out, the Twins are amazed and taking notes, the Hufflepuff stick together and once Hermione is calmed down from her freak out, she begins to realise that this is an excellent training exercise.

Harry, as always, plays the hero and ends up freeing the last person who played it... Possibly a grizzled old muggle who still has a thing or two to teach regarding battle tactics

**** Cluedo is the "who murdered him where with what" game. Like "Major von Blom, with the candelabra, in the library".

***** Must be a localization thing, because I know that game by just the name "Clue", so was figuring Cluedo was a similar but different game or some other franchise/standalone like Jumanji and Zanthura.

*** She comes into the Great Hall with Luna and whoever else was/is playing the game with her, and Albus has a freakout, thinking he's either gone mad or overdosed on some potions, or Ariana has decided to haunt him after all these years (or we could find out he's /been/ haunted by hallucinations of her for years for a less humorous take).
