** He didn't say brightest of her year, he said she's the brightest witch her age, like of all the fourteen years olds he's ever met, she's the brightest. This would include everyone he went to Hogwarts with when they were 14, any he's met beside that, etc.

** Hermione certainly was very capable. I mean, for the DA coins she basically reverse engineered Voldemort's secret messaging method based on a vague description from Harry.

Whether or not she was the brightest is irrelevant. Her deeds speak louder than any random accolades. At the same time, it is important to remember that she was not that good when she had to improvise (there is no wood) and her improvisations were rather ruthless. Just ask Umbridge, who avoided "crushed by a giant" only be taken by mythological creatures who are infamous for gang rape. Hermione didn't even bat an eye at that fate (not a flaw IMO, but a lot of authors make her too good of a person).

** Well when you compare her to real life students; the things she accomplishes are mind boggling.

- I was a 10 pointer student but I honestly don't think that I could have actually learned a year's worth of study material in a month and a half on my own and without the guidance of a teacher.

She practically learned all the study material and additional books before enteringHogwarts. And she actually learned it completely. Harry had also read all of his books andhe was not able to answer questions at the drop of the hat in potions while Hermione knewall the answers. If not a genius then she would have to have an extremely good long termmemory.

I could without anyone's help; maybe learn a year's worth of Mathematics in thatamount of time but even that is a stretch because I am going to hit parts I would strugglewith. And it's my best subject.

Hermione learnt the whole course material for her year without any help in a time period Iwould have struggled to do the same in my best subject. Maybe I was just a really dumbstudent and what Hermione accomplished is normal but IMHO she is a genius.

- Then there is third year in which she took four electives on top of all the core subjects, and also researched the wizarding world's legal framework on her own without anyone with knowledge of the law to help her. She did this to save Buckbeak.

I am studying business law and it is incredibly frustrating with some of the examples for aparticular section contradicting what other sections say. It is really hard to navigate withoutsomeone to help. And she still did as a fourteen year old. Given she had a time turner butstill.

- Fourth year she helped Harry survive the tournament. She was working as hard as Harry but was not exempted from the tournament and started SPEW.
- Fifth year she helped run the DA and the SPEW, was a prefect and still managed to get 9 O's and 1 E in DADA. In fact the only person we know to have outperformed her in her year is Harry who got O in DADA 5 E's and 1 A, P and D. Ron's result was same as Harry but he got an E in DADA.

The only people known to have gotten more OWL's than her are Percy, Bill, Barty Crouch.

I am not saying that others like Lily, Tom, Albus and the like couldn't have outscored her, we just don't know. So from what we have seen she definitely is really smart academically and unless wizards and witches are a lot smarter than normal people (going by canon they should not be) Hermione is really a Genius to have accomplished some of the stuff that she has.

Or she could have had Eidetic memory allowing her to retain all the knowledge she read and as most of the spells are just memorization of wand movements and incantation this would give her even a bigger leg up on her peers.

*Edit-* I completely forgot about the polyjuice potion she brew in 2nd year. She must have been really talented to have made a NEWT level potion on her first try after only one year of study. Or she could have been genius to have studied at least five years worth of potions in one year. Either scenario proves just how brilliant she was.

**** We know that they passed but not their actual grades. We don't even know if Barty did get 12 OWLs as the only time it is referenced is by his father who had just escaped the Imperio and was rambling. Yes if someone gets O, EE or A on a test they are given the OWL. Case in Point, both Harry and Ron got A on Astronomy.

And no they did not get the time turner as it is implied that Hermione was the only person to get it. Why you ask. Because; get this; the schedule clashed. So Mcgonagall (not Dumbledore) in her infinite wisdom decided that instead of changing the schedule so that their was no clash; it would be good idea to write several letters to the ministry to obtain a time turner for Hermione. Let that sink in. No time turner to help one of her student who was forced to participate in a deadly tournament; but it is absolutely needed so that a student can take all the classes when the issue can be solved easily by changing the schedule.

But no that can't be done. Would it really have been so bad to let Harry cast the Patronus the first time Rowling? Why did you create such a mess?

I hate time turners with a passion.

***** It is really hard to explain why they didn't change the class schedule in-universe, out-universe JKR needed someway to add the time-turner so it could save Sirius. It could have worked if she didn't then say that 3 other people had taken all the classes without the TT. It's bad writing.

****** Yes I know and that is why I hate it very much. Fifth year they could not get it as the ministry hated their guts and they were destroyed in the end. But seriously it would have been invaluable in fourth year and helped so much. But no we can not give it to a 14 year old student who is going to face a dragon which take 10 specifically trained adult wizards to subdue. But yeah let us give it to a 14 year old so she can take all the classes which she could have taken anyway if you rescheduled the classes.

** I've had an idea about a muggle education professional seeing Hogwarts and being massively dissapointed, with a curriculum of basically memorization with little problem solving or creative thinking. And being shown Hermoines work as best of her class and being sad that such a promising mind is being wasted on material that would leave her woefully underprepared if she ever tried to go to a decently preforming academic situation...

*** Also that it seems that the most desired jobs are with the Ministry yet nothing is taught at Hogwarts to get a job as a ministry worker. You learn magic, history and astronomy for a job that uses none of these at all. Hogwarts is set to help people work with magic and yet most jobs seem to be completely normal and require a normal education.

*** I've been reading Strange Visitors from Another Century and this is kind of a point that's brought up in that.

(It also makes me rethink Snape a bit... maybe part of his... issues are either that he's forced to teach to the test or, alternatively, that he genuinely can't understand why/fathom that teaching potions as recipes doesn't make everyone else see how potion making actually works. He's obviously still an arsehole regardless but we must remember that his trap in Philosopher's Stone was a logic problem...)

That being said, wizarding society appears to be enormously corrupt and bureaucratic in general. It also changes, very, very slowly. I'm not necessarily convinced Hermione would be unprepared for what passes as "the real world" in wizarding Britain. I mean, look at Percy and the cauldrons.
