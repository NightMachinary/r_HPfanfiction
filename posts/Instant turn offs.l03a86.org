If Hogwarts is sentient I immediately click off and question my existence for several minutes. “LADY HOGWARTS “ Dumbledork gasped.

Does no one consider how UTTERLY stupid that sounds.

Anyone else got a thing that makes there day infinitely worse after reading to the point you stop reading for the day.


** Not acknowledging that the whole Snape and James situation was complicated.

Instead portraying Snape as the poor innocent victim and it's totally James' fault that he became a Death Eater and James is an abusive asshole who totally didn't deserve Lily and probably potioned her and Snape is her true love and...

I think I just threw up in my mouth. /shudder/

But yeah. Excessive Snape worship and James bashing? Instant no for me.

******* Snape was a teenager too when he joined the Death Eaters. A bullied teenager who lived in a dorm for roughly 10 months out of the year with racist kids who, presumably, at some point decided to recruit him to their cause. So, he was a bullied teenager who has just lost his only friend, had a shit home life, and suddenly found his dorm mates being inclusive toward him despite the fact that he had (in their view) a less than ideal bloodline. I can't imagine Death Eaters start their recruiting by saying “hey, we're going to be mass murdering terrorists, want to join?” They were likely able to very very persuasive when they wanted to be, and Snape would have been a very vulnerable target to them.

And then, after a few years, he left and risked his life working against them despite the fact that the “good” people pretty much universally despised him.

I'm not saying Snape is a good person. He's not. He's a grey character, and was designed to be a grey character. He did both good and bad things in his life and was aware that he made many mistakes.

But if you honestly think that a bullied teenager, who lived in poverty, had shitty parents, and never got any help from authority figures, who ended up joining a group that was on the opposite side of his worst bullies is completely irredeemable, I'm a bit concerned about what you think about all of the teens in real life who end up joining gangs in similar circumstances.

People aren't just good or bad. They can be complex and self-contradictory and can be victims of their circumstances. This doesn't absolve him, but dismissing him outright as a shit person for joining the Death Eaters is shortsighted and lacks an understanding of social pressures and the urgency one can feel to better their life when all they've known is despair.

******** I'm not saying he is irredeemable - but I'm not going to say "yeah, Marauders, Snape, all the same". Snape, for all his childhood, was magnitudes worse than the Marauders. Having a hard childhood doesn't, in any way shape or form, excuse joining the Death Eaters. I'm sick and tired of people talking as if bullying and mass-murder is the same crime.

It's not. And "I was bullied" only goes so far - it stops way, way short of murder, much less attempted genocide.

******* Which he then left, and died fighting. Sirius sent Snape to his death, I'm of the opinion that 12 years of emotional torture is probably enough of a punishment but that doesn't change what was done. Remus deliberately hid information that would aid in the capture of Sirius, he did not tell anyone even after Sirius had broken into the castle. He was brought in specifically because he knew Sirius and could aid in his capture, but he never shared. These are not minor problems. These are personality flaws that are actually on the same level with those that Snape has.

I like bashing generally, but it irritates me when bashing comes at the expense of the characters actual flaws, The Marauders are flawed characters, just like Snape. They get into the most grey area anyone in the series gets to, so I'm generally annoyed when I see any of them propped up while the others get the shaft. Besides I think Snape bashing is generally pretty bad. He had a specific MO when it came to tormenting Harry, and it annoys me when people forget about it for a cheap "Haha I'm the greatest" moment. For a non-Snape example, would you like it if a Hermione bashing story made her big character flaw that she went around stealing stuff, as opposed to say, her desire to be the best? It's a new character flaw, which I would argue is less interesting than the original. That's how I generally feel about Snape bashing.

******** Again, the Marauders are flawed characters. Snape, though is a former mass-murdering Nazi who even after he changed sides spent his time at school tormenting children.

This isn't about bashing Snape - this is about setting the record straight. A bully isn't nearly as bad as a genocidal Nazi, which is what Snape was.

I'm sick and tired of the Snape white-washing.

********* My point is that they are all flawed characters. Snape did some good in the end, the Marauders did some bad. I don't like the idea of painting characters without flaws and without redeeming features. It makes the characters less human than they should be. This doesn't make bashing bad. I just think the caricature should come from their real negative traits.

*** Not only that but Hogwarts has been in service as a school for a long time and was enchanted/founded by some very interesting people.

My headcannon is that Hogwarts isn't really sentient, but has 'Direction.' When the diary was on the loose with the Basilisk running around, all those people got stoned instead of killed, which unless the diary was specifically aiming for that, is a huge coincidence. I like to imagine the castle's 'keep students safe' enchantment was subtly nudging things the whole time. Oh, a water puddle! Oh, shift this ghost a little to stone them both, etc.

** I actually like sentient hogwarts when its shown to be a distinctly Non-Human sentience, like a magical version of an AI or a genis loci. But some things that are a turn off fic wise would be Slash in general, fics that have literal 12 year olds try/succeed in gangraping another 12 year old or rape as a plot device in general, obviously bad grammar in the summary, too many overly specific tags, when crossover fics take the mc(Harry Potter) and replace him with someone completely different but keep the name and fics where less than 50% of the pov is Harry and/or following Harry's tale, the fandom is called Harry Potter not Ron Weasley not Draco Malfoy not Hermione Granger and certainly not Severus Snape.
