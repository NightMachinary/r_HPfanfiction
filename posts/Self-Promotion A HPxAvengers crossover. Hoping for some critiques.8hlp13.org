Right, so I've been working on this for a while and I'm feeling kind of... blegh about it. I know that what I have is not the quality of work I want to put out there, so I was hoping if anyone could give me some idea of what areas I should try and improve on. I haven't written many long fics (the longest I've written is ongoing at 30k words), and I've never managed to complete a novel-length story before. So this is sort of new territory for me.

Anyway, if anyone is interested in taking a look and leaving some criticism, I'd be really appreciative. Rip it apart if you want, I just want to know what I can improve on.

P.S. I know it sounds really tropey, and this subreddit isn't exactly big on tropes, but I've tried to play around with them in ways I haven't seen done in other fics, or haven't seen done often.


** - Gender bender

- Ridiculous name

- Two characters named Jess in the first chapter makes for confusion.

- It's a fusion not a crossover, which ruins any chance of this being interesting.

I've never seen them done well. There is no chance that of the HP wizarding world existing along side the MCU shenanigans. It doesn't fit. Wizard would fix most problems, for the sake of the statute of secrecy if nothing else.

I assume that when you say it's a fusion you mean that I've combined the HP and Marvel world instead of doing dimensional travel or something similar? I was under the impression that any fanfic that involves two or more different fandoms was considered a crossover, regardless of whether dimensional travel had been involved or not.

It's a cross-over, but also a fusion. It's a sub-category of cross-overs.

Whatevs, really: fusions do not automatically make fics bad, it's just that they're liked by people who write but can't write and this makes them ... rather visible to those looking for examples of badly-written stuff. If you do your world-building well fusions are absolutely fine, cool even at times; for example, take esama's “Island of Fire” series, which is a fusion, albeit with little outside world present, of “Harry Potter” and “Temeraire”, and with how it's all presented the result is really cool; on the other hand, there's a story that's basically a rewrite of MCU that has Harry Potter characters substituting MCU characters and despite them all having magic powers and being different people it's a fracking rehash with no changes whatsoever, and this is an example of a crappy fusion that makes people think that all fusions are shit.

Point, you need to be a good writer and world-builder to pull of fusions, but if you do they're absolutely fine. That's it from me as I haven't even seen your fic yet.

**** Yeah and fusion is two different universes/fandoms existing together. It's nearly impossible to reconcile when you're talking magic/sci-fi, which means you'll constantly have continuity errors. Hence, fusions are shit.

I'd also advise making your chapters at least 4k each, otherwise it's just a pain to read. And you shouldn't use the excuse of having posted something to justify not fixing a problem. If you do that things can't really improve.

Clearly this isn't something I'm going to enjoy, but we need to be criticized to improve. I hope you don't take it personally.

#+end_quote

The Marvel universe (a mish-mash of entire genres created by hundreds of writers over half a century) already has multiple magic systems in it (Sorceror Supreme and Asgardian in the MCU alone). Nothing needs to be reconciled. "Hi, I'm Harry Potter and this is how I use magic." Done.

Writing and editing are two related but different skill sets (roughly, creativity vs critical analysis). Many fanfic authors have had their joy of writing killed by trying to go back and edit their works.

HP wizards are incredibly powerful by the MCU standard. The canon threats aren't a problem when you've got a few wizards just taking care of things. It doesn't fit together. They can't co-exist and make sense.

***** It's fine, I asked to be ripped apart. If I took it personally, I would be a hypocrite.

As for your problem with magic/sci-fi fusions, I'm not exactly a science person, so I admit I hadn't really considered the continuity problems of trying to reconcile magic and sci-fi. Could you raise an example of how they might be problems? Again, I'd never really thought about it before, so I can't actually think of anything off the top of my head.

Fair points on the chapter length and not fixing the problem. For the latter, I didn't fix it because a) I'd already posted it and b) Jess Wright only appears in that first chapter and is almost never mentioned again. Now though, I think I'll probably change it.

****** Caveat: I haven't read it yet, but regarding fantasy vs science fiction, I refer you to Clarke's Third Law and its corollary:

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

Any sufficiently understood magic is indistinguishable from technology.

The MCU is not hard Sci-fi (like, at all), and nothing from Asgardians, to bullshit superscience, to the Infinity Stones stands in the way of combining it with Harry Potter.

Also, Doctor Strange, who is a literal wizard.

I've seen Stargate fused with the Dresden Files (and it's amazing), so there's nothing stopping you from managing to fuse the MCU with HP successfully without any continuity errors, it just takes extra thought and planning to make sure all the pieces fit together.

******* I don't really see how you think they can fuse without complete destroying the continuity or one or both worlds. It isn't that scifi and fantasy can't go together, its that different worlds within those genres generally don't go together with each other.

You can mix the Stargate Universe the same as the HP one. Since both are hidden and separate they don't interfere. You can't mix HP and MCU because if the wizarding world exists it destroys the MCU because there are demigods running around that completely overpower the heroes and villains.

--------------

Trying to fuse them means you have to remake one of the worlds. Since HP is based on more history and is the protagonist I'd keep that. But then you're writing a fic about super heroes waking up and the HP governments keeping everything hushed up. Spiderman gets his powers? Hes taken aside and told the rules, obey or go to prison. Same for everyone else. There can't be a Doctor Strange, he's bound by the statute of secrecy. Which means the MCU no longer exists.

  Weak, bitter and reclusive, Jess Wright is nobody. But when she emerges from her isolation to work at Stark Industries, she is cold and ruthless, nothing like the Jess Wright of years past. The reason is simple: another wears her face and claims her life. Jessamine Potter, Mistress of Death, arrives at the dawn of a new world of superheroes and gods. Fem, Amoral, OP, MoD Harry.

** I would ignore all of EpicBeardMan's comments. They are laughable complaints.

The first issue, being the gender bending, is a non-issue to begin with. There are thousands of stories involving a female Harry out there, be they purely in the Harry Potter fandom or be they in crossover/fusion fanfiction.

The second issue, being the ridiculous name, is just silly. Jessamine is an alternate spelling of Jasmine, which is a flower name. The Evans family name their daughters after flowers (Petunia and Lily), and the Potter family is known to use alternate spellings in naming their children (Charlus).

The third issue, being the similarly named Jessamine and Jess, is just both lazy and ignorant on EpicBeardName's part. For one, Jessamine is never referred to as Jess, except for when she is posing as Jess. Secondly, one is a four letter word and the other is a nine letter word. Finally, did it never cross his mind that Jessamine sought out someone with a similar name so that she would automatically respond to the name. Much easier to keep up an impersonation if you are responsive to the name of the person you are impersonating.

His final point, being the fusion ruining the setting, is just nonsense. Harry Potter magic does not break the setting. See the Masters of the Mystic Arts. The International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy does not break the setting. Again, see the Masters of the Mystic Arts. I will point out that Thor, the heir apparent to Asgard, did not know of the existence of the Masters of the Mystic Arts.

Now that's out of the way, great story. Hope to see it continue soon, and to find out more about Jessamine's history and goals. For instance, was she a Slytherin here, or a Gryffindor? Why did she leave Wizarding Britain? What does she hope to accomplish with a high ranking position in Stark Industries?

*** I'm glad to see that you're enjoying the story :D Honestly, that was the logic behind my decision to name Jessamine and Jess similar names. However, I later thought that given Jessamine's personality, she would be able to adapt pretty well to a completely different name anyway, which is why I began to reconsider my decision. Anyway, at this point, I'm sort of torn on whether to change it or not because a different name just feels kind of... wrong now.

I'll be exploring Jessamine's history/goals further in the later chapters. Sorry for the succinct answer, but I'm trying not to spoil anything :x But the story should begin to shed some light on that somewhere in the next five chapters. This is just a vague feeling I have though, I haven't really written anything concrete down so that timeline is subject to change.

I missed an update recently because life has just thrown a whole bunch of bullshit in my way this past week x.x I barely had time to write more than a handful of words each day. But things should be back on track after tomorrow, so I should be able to update this week.

While I agree that Jessamine could easily impersonate anyone she wanted, I feel it speaks to the character that she manipulates the situation to get someone that is pretty much a what if version of herself. Jess Wright is what Jessamine might have become if she had never went to Hogwarts and gotten out from under the thumb of the Dursleys.

Jessamine took the job? Nice. The fact she'll be interacting with people like Justin Hammer is cool, and the part about the possum made me laugh. That's twice now she's made Obadiah pause and think. I wonder if she still calls him Obadiah, or if she's reverted to the more formal Mr Stane now that he's her boss. Anyway, in the MCU he doesn't have a daughter. Are you using Whitney from Armored Adventures?

The recruitment of Dennis Creevey for his hacking skills makes me curious. Who is she planning on hacking? I'm thinking it's Justin Hammer. Knowing Jessamine, she wants to be prepared for the meeting. To be in control of the meeting.

I'm still not sure on Jessamine's sorting. She's friends with Pansy, rivals with Daphne, and knows Ron and Hermione. Her history is also at least somewhat like canon. She may have taken different electives, but certain events still took place. Like the private lessons with Dumbledore in her sixth year. Oh, and Dumbledore was 115 by the way, not 120.
