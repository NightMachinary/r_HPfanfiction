:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Harry was in Diagon Alley for his first year shopping trip and a fight breaks out. Harry jumps in front of a killing curse to save a goblin in front of several witnesses. Later on, he cashes in a favor with the goblins. I think the fic mostly avoids the “friend of goblins” trope, however (at least I hope so).

(Also, if you know of any other fics where Harry survives a 2nd killing curse, I'd be interested)

Thanks!


** Most master of death stories have this element. One of my favorites of those is Back with a Purpose by Theblacksresurgence. Pretty good harry in marauder Era fic.

**** I think they got two fics mixed up. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backwards With Purpose by deadwoodpecker]], ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15498366/chapters/35978250?view_adult=true][AO3 Link]]) isn't set in the Maurader Era nor has MOD Harry, but he does survive another killing curse. The one I believe they are talking about is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12317784/1/Stepping-Back][Stepping Back by TheBlack'sResurgence.]] The pairing is apparently Harry/Bellatrix, which is offputting to me. I haven't read it though.
