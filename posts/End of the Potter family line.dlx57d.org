Hello all

I was thinking when Harry got hit with the killing curse the second time before he meers Dumbledore he dies right? Does that mean the Potter family line is extinct because there's no more Potter's around.


** Well, if he would have stayed dead, then yes. I can't think of other Potters (at that time). But since he came back, the Potter family is healthy and alive and he got to have kids and give them funny names. Or one of them at least.

**** Don't think so. As long as he is there to continue his line, he is seen as alive. And I don't know if he actually.../died/ since his soul was still there in his body. I think he was more at a crossroads between life and death. Sort of the in-between.

***** I always thought that all that happened to Harry in Kings Cross took no time back in the real world, and when he chose to go back time resumed, while if he had chosen the move on his body would have died. He wakes up on the floor because he blacked out, but he was never 'dead'.

** James Potter is son of Fleamont and Euphemia Potter, not Charlus Potter as fanon assumed for the longest time before JKR said otherwise.

If Charlus and Dorea Potter were Harry's great uncle and aunt, and they had their own kids, then there would still be Potters around.

On the other hand, JKR handwaved all Potter and Evans relatives to be dead, just so Harry would have no one to raise him but the Dursleys. This makes no sense, because wizards can live up to 150 years old, and James and Lily were only 21 when they died. But Word of God, I guess. ðŸ™„

**** JKR wrote an article on Pottermore about the Potter family.

[[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/the-potter-family]]

If Harry dies, there's still probably distant Peverell relatives floating around, without the surname. Wizarding Britain has a tiny population, and most wizards marry within their Hogwarts age group.

*** James parents were already elderly when he was born and then they got dragonpox when he was 20, it makes sense why they would have died and why their parents would already be dead at that point.

**** Lily's parents are dead by the time she's 21. James and Lily's entire extended family are all gone too. According to Cursed Child, Petunia is dead by 2019, at 60 years old.

You can try to explain it with an in-universe reason, but its necessity is purely due to the fact that the author killed them off out of plot convenience. Harry needed to be an orphan, and Albus Severus needed to start drama over what he inherited from Petunia Dursley.

** I think the proper term would be something like clinical death (of course, this is an attempt to apply the Muggle medicine on the magical event), not real death, so that the House of Potter has not finished then.
