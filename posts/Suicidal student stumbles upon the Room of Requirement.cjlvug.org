What would the Room show him/her? Dark fic, obviously.


** I could easily see this being a dark fic, but I could also see it being kind of redeeming too. Like if they walked past the door thinking "I need a way to end my pain" or perhaps "I need to escape from this life" and the room gave them something helpful like an inspiring book or a portrait to talk to or maybe even it opens into the office of a teacher who could help.

** Not exactly a darkfic, but it's what struck my inspiration. Sorry for the length. Kinda got away from me a bit and I began losing motivation a bit towards the end, so the quality tapers off.

Anyway, here's my suicidal RoR attempt.

#+begin_quote
  Luna Lovegood knelt in front of the toilet of the girls lavatory, scooping out water and desperately felt around. Her blouse was drenched and her fingers stomach lurched at the dingy bathroom odor.

  She tried in vane to ignore laughs and jeers of her classmates as they mocked her.

  "Wow, Luna. You've reached a new low, bobbing for shite in the toilet like a headcase. You belong in the looney bin."

  She snaked her hand down as far as she could, but could only feel the slimy drain as she reached as far as she could.

  It had been like this for three years. She remembered how excited her dad had been, telling her how many friends she'd make. She remembered her mother telling her that the companions she would make at Hogwarts would be the people she could count on for the rest of her life.

  She'd been alone ever since, so... alone.

  "Yeah she does," said Catherine, the third year Ravenclaw girl that slept in the bed next to her in their dorm. "Looney Lovegood! Just got out of the looney bin!"

  All the girls doubled over in laughter as Luna finally gave up and crumpled to the floor, tears mixing with the smelly toilet water running down her cheeks.

  She turned around, looking down at their feet. "Why?" she asked. "That was the last thing I had to remember her."

  "Shut up, Looney," said Catherine, causing the other girls to break into giggles again. "You probably were the reason she died."

  Luna lurched back, a horrified expression appearing on her face. How did they know? Was that a guess? "No!"

  "You killed her didn't you?" she turned to the other girls ."Looney murdered her mum! We're gonna tell everyone!"

  They all laughed

  "No!" she screamed. It was an accident, she hadn't meant to distract her mum during the experiment that ended her life.

  She stumbled to her feet through a haze of tears and bolted from the bathroom. All the while hearing the girls chanting "Looney killed her mu-um! Looney killed her mu-um!" repeatedly singsong voices.

  Luna ran, not anywhere in particular, she just ran. They were right; she killed her mum. She didn't deserve to have her mum's locket. They were right to flush it down the toilet.

  Luna meandered aimlessly for what felt like hours, not even trying to stem the hysterical sobbing. She wished it had been her that died, and not her mum. She didn't know what to do. What could she do?

  Try as she may, Luna couldn't get her spiraling thoughts to form into something approaching reason. She wished Dad were here. She wished Mum--no, she didn't even deserve to think about her mother.

  What could she do? Who could she talk to? She had nobody, nothing, no options--she was lost.

  Luna wished she could make it all end: the taunting, the bullying, the repeating images of her mother being torn apart by soulfire that cycles through her thoughts and dreams.

  She should just throw herself off the Astronomy Tower...

  ...

  Her gaze slowly drifted upwards as her whirling mind settled on that one idea, and it solidified in her mind like a glacier, becoming an immovable fixture.

  That was it. She could make it all end.

  Luna began to march up to winding maze of moving stairs, upward and upward passing the fourth floor, the fifth floor, the sixth floor, and finally arrived on the seventh floor.

  She turned left down the corridor leading towards the astronomy tower, frantic now. It was her ONLY option. She'd finally be free.

  She glanced to the side as she passed a tapestry depicting an image of Barnabas the Barmy and froze as her brain suddenly conjured a memory.

  /Six year old Luna sat on her mother's lap, crying softly./

  /"Th-then they said I was weird and they d-didn't want to play with me!"/

  /Her mother cooed softly in her ear, rocking back and forth. "You know there's nothing wrong with being a little different, my Love."/

  /Luna looked up at her Mummy, eyes wide. "There isn't?"/

  /"Of course not. Have I have told you the story of Barnabus the Barmy?"/

  /Little Luna shook her head vigorously, and her mummy began to tell her a story in a calm, comforting tone./

  The memory made Luna pause. Would Mum really want her to do this? Want her to die?

  Luna sniffed and slowly walked back the way she'd come. Surely, Mum wouldn't want her to hurt herself.

  No! It had been Luna's fault that she died. Even if it was an accident. She walked back towards the astronomy tower. Then she began pacing back and forth, torn by life or death indecision.

  Finally, just as she made up her mind to give into the pressure and despair. To make it all end and see her mother again, she noticed a ripple out of the corner of her vision.

  She turned and stared at the door that had just appeared beside her. That hadn't been their a moment before.

  She glanced down the hall, toward the astronomy tower, before pushing the door open and walking inside thinking "I just don't want to be alone."

  A gasp escaped Luna as she entered, the room was filled with a lush forest of trees and vibrant golden light shining through the canopy.

  She began to amble forward, slowly, taking in a deep breath of fresh forest air. It was unlike the drab and gloomy depths of the Forbidden Forrest, but instead reminded of her a glade of trees she'd camped in with her mum and dad when they'd gone on vacation in Sweden.

  After a while, she found herself walking into a clearing and she sat down on a tree stump in front of a softly crackling fire.

  Luna sat in wonder, but before long her thoughts drifted back to the scene in the bathroom and flashes of raging soulfire appeared in her head. She felts tears threatening to flow again, when a small creature walked up to her.

  It was plump and walked on four legs and made a funny blibbering sound like the raspberries her father used to blow on her tummy when she was small.

  "Hello," she said, extending a hand. It waddled over and sniffed at her hand before blibbering again and snorting.

  "I'm Luna. What's your name?"

  It simply lifted it's forepaws onto her thighs and sniffed at her earrings. It let out a blibbering hum that sounded like laughter and it made her giggle.

  "You're a blibbering humdinger aren't you?"

  It just blibbered again and laid down next to her.

  Next, Luna looked up to see another creating perched on the branch of a tree. It looked like a sort of cross between a bird and a squirrel with big owlish eyes, long avian hindlegs and the short grasping hands of a rodent. Between the front and hind legs was feathered webbing between, and a big bushy tail at its rump. On it's head were two tough looking horns that looked liked they'd been crushed down with a mallet.

  "Hi, there," she said

  It blinked.

  She blinked.

  "I'm Luna, what's your name?"

  The creature spread its--were they wings?--and leapt forward off the tree.

  For a second Luna thought it would take flight, but it just glided down and settled on her lap.

  "You can't fly at all, can you? Just glide." It let out a long snort that sounded more like a snore and laid it's hand down on her chest.

  "You're a crumple-horned snorkack," she pronounced with a smile.

  It just fluttered it's "wings" and snorted at her again.

  Over the next hour, Luna chatted with the animals and told them about all the trouble's she'd been having at school and even told them the story of her mother's death and cried with them over her grief.

  The entire time they just sat wit her and listened. That's all she really wanted... somebody to listen... to not be alone.

  After a long time, the forest had grown dark and the fire had burned down to embers.

  "I think it's time to go," she said. "Thank you so much for listening to me."

  The blibbering humdinger blibbered, nuzzling her earrings again as it hummed in laughter. It waddled off into the forest.

  The crumple-horned snorkack let out another snort as it glided off her and clamored up the tree.

  She noticed her head and cleared and there were specks of light floating around her head in like nearly invisible fireflies.

  "You must have been what was making my head so fuzzy and confused."

  The motes of light vibrated threateningly.

  "You little wrackspurts," she said, saying the first thing that came to mind.

  She swatted them wildly, but eventually sighed and made her way back toward the door.

  She dreaded returning to her dorm room, but for once, she didn't feel completely alone. She waved to Barnabas the Barmy on the way way out.

  What a strange room.

**** Thanks! Yeah it kinda came together nicely by. accident. I'm kinda tempted to publish it, but the whole suicidal part seems a bit extreme without the context of the prompt.

I like that idea about the locket. Initially I planned for it to he Myrtles lavatory and for her to meet Myrtle in the RoR, but this seemed more cathartic.

Also, I'm sure there are plenty more typos, but thanks for pointing it out.
