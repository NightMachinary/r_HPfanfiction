I finished Rereading Make a Wish and it's Half as good Sequel a few days ago over Thanksgiving here in the states. Now I was wondering if there was any serious takes on that Idea?

No Slash plz Don't recommend "Identity by Highbrass" as I have already read it


** Well.. there are several continuations on Make a Wish done by other people. Such as Mr Black and the Contract which has Black Ink become a summon contract for Naruto Uzumaki with Mr Black as the Boss Summon. There is also Terminal Justice which has Mr Black sucked into the DC universe where he hooks up with Supergirl whilst solving all of their problems in his usual bumbling way.

*** Though I have to add that the latter is not really serious but rather similar in tone to the original. Entertaining, though.
