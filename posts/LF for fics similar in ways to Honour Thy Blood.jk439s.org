Yo. Finished this story the other day and have since been hunting fics in a similar vein. While HTB did have its faults, it's the first story I've come across with a non evil!harry who starts truly taking the fight to Tom and his killing curse throwers with anything but stunners.

The main thing I'm looking for is a Harry who fights it like the war it is. Stunners against killing curses just doesn't appeal to me, nor do I think it makes much sense. Non slash romance is a bonus if its not a harem, please no angst, bashing is fine if not too overboard, same with time travel and dimension travel(as long as it stays in the HP world)

The more independent the better. Prefer grey!harry, but dark!harry is fine as long as he isn't indiscriminately killing people for petty reasons. evil!Harry is a no go.

Please help me out here. I'm getting bored with the standard "everyone deserves another chance" while they are killing ppl and throwing killing curses at you vein that alot of stories take.


** Once Harry fights Voldemort's cohorts later on in this story he takes it very seriously. He's also grey-ish but not really I don't think.

** The time travel fic Stepping Back by TheBlack'sResurgence (the same author as Honour Thy Blood) uses this concept. Harry is trained by the unspeakables after the battle in the DoM and is sent back to the Marauder's Era. He doesn't "pull any punches" when he fights the Death Eaters.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  Canon Divergence from HBP. When Harry fails to save Ron's life in Slughorn's office, he and Hermione are thrust into a search for answers. But the path is thornier than either of them could have possibly imagined.
