- I prefer if the main character isn't an OC, but if you know a really good one it's ok
- It could be one about a character(or more) is self aware
- or it could be one character that just have brains and point out all the plot holes and insanity in this world

  Lord Hadrian James Potter Black Gaunt Gryffindor Slytherin Hufflepuff Ravenclaw Peverell is confronted by the manipulative old coot about his heroics against his opponents. How will our edgelord hero fare against the headmaster's machinations? An exaggerated parody of fanfiction tropes. Dark!Harry Grey!Harry Manipulative!Dumbledore

** Harry Potter and the something something and Potter Ever After are fanfics who mocks and make Fun of several cliches and tropes of fanfiction, like super abusive dursleys, wbwl, bashing Weasleys and Hermione, harens and etc. The first is a continuous story but unfortunately it is incomplete, while the second each chapter makes fun of a specific trope (time travel or Dramione).
