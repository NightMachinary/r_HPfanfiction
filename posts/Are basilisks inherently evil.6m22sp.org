They were created by Herpo the Foul, the guy JKR has said created the first horcrux. Considering the kinda stuff he got into, hatching a chicken's egg under a toad seems kinda tame. Now, obviously a giant venomous snake that can kill with a stare doesn't appear to have much of an upside but do you believe any dark magic was used in its creation which would classify it as a dark creature similar to dementors and boggarts which exist only to cause suffering or is it simply a whooping great snek that's super dangerous but it completely fine with not killing and causing suffering.

In a slightly related note, in indy Harry/ abused Harry stories the Dursely's often got Harry the wrong prescription, ignoring the fact that he still was a great seeker, is there any story/crack fic that takes it to the nth degree and his glasses are so bad they render him immune to the gaze of the basilisk because he can't see it properly?


** Well, you've got to use some sort of will-overpowering magic to keep the toad sitting on the egg for as long as it needs to. You've got to overpower it's desire to move, eat, relieve itself so that it can sit on that egg. It's an unnatural behavior and it leads to an unnatural creation. Maybe that corruption of nature leads to the corrupted, malicious entity.

Secondly, if Magic is naturally occurring in humans and there are magical-beings that existed long before both Wizards and Muggles, then it's safe to say that Magic is as natural as anything else.

You have nature and physics and the laws of the Universe. And then you have magic that trumps that and follows only it's own laws.

Wizards understand there are laws they can break, they experience it every day. You can't use magic to levitate a feather and not understand that you can't levitate a feather without magic.

Even if it doesn't manipulate gravity directly, the result violates it, so it manipulates it as a result.\\
But if you don't like this example, what do you think about the simple Lumos charm, that casually violates entropy by creating light (which means energy) out of nothing? Or do you think magic is energy? That changes nothing, you're still adding energy to a system from nothing. That goes against every law of nature.

Levitation is Levitation, no manipulation of Gravity Directly, the result doesn't violate it as it doesn't operate within it. You levitate it through Magic, not through the manipulation of gravity, therefore, it freely moves through the air as an independent variable.

The point of view of the wizards doesn't have anything to do with what is natural and what isn't. Just like the laws of physics have nothing to do with the point of view of the scientists, they can understand it better or worst, but the thing is there, whatever the way we think about it.

How does it disprove anything? It simply means that levitating a troll's club is as easy as levitating a feather. The club still flies while it shouldn't, and the result still breaks the laws of physics, exactly the same way. If anything, it's a proof that magic isn't energy, which is my opinion anyway. Magic is magic and operates by magic and do so while ignoring the laws of physics.

Once again, where you're wrong. Magic doesn't have some kind of odd vendetta against Scientific Laws, Magic just does, it breaks nothing in the process, it does what is intended by the Wizard with minimal side effects (Excess energy from the spell creating lights and other visible signs such as beams and jets, user feeling something from the spell like their ears popping or a headache etc...)

I'll provide something easier than the Levitation Charm. How about the Fire-Making Charm? It doesn't heat up molecules, it makes fire, how does it make fire if not by our own way of thinking? Magic. Magic is turtles all the way down, many Mages greater than yourself have spent years wasting away on what it is and how it can apply within Human rationalism, but it doesn't and it can't.

Transfiguration alone (and conjuration) means that you're in a post-scarcity economy (mostly), and this, in turn, would lead to a huge and ever growing leisure class.\\
That seems good at first sight, but it always creates a lot of problems. Most people need something to do, or they become depressed, or find shelter in various forms of entertainment.\\

** What is an evil creature? Are lions evil? Sharks? We need some sort of classification system, and that'll depend on your opinion.

A classification I like (idk if i's canon or not but it was in a fic i read and stuck with me), but a "dark" creature is one that either recognizes humans are sentient beings and still wishes to hurt them or is very easy to control by wizards and can wreck lots of damage.

Examples: Acromantulas can talk to people but still want to eat them.

Inferi are easily exploited by wizards.

Dragons are dangerous but not sentient and cannot be easily controlled, so it's not evil.

Under this framework a Basilisk would be dark as (depending on how u view parseltongue) they are either sentient, easily controllable, or both.

***** Just to expand on this-

JRRT was a linguist, hence language being such a prominent theme in the Legendarium. One of the purest expressions of his love for language comes in how it's treated by the various peoples who populated his world. The elves, innately beautiful and good, tended to their language like a garden. But Orcs detested everything that existed, including themselves, and so each tribe or city of orcs spoke their own haphazardly made language which was only capable of expressing cruelty.

Sauron attempted but failed to unite the evils of Middle Earth under a wretched language of his own, which was known as Black Speech. In the Third Age, when the War of The Ring takes place, only Sauron, his highest lieutenants, and some special trolls are capable of speaking Black Speech in full. One of these lieutenants was the Mouth of Sauron, a twisted "diplomat" who met the last remaining forces of men before the Black Gate just before the final battle of the War of the Ring. He's, of course, hideous, but his mouth is especially destroyed from speaking Black Speech so often.

There are in fact two occasions when we someone "pure" speaks Black Speech, and it's the two times Gandalf recites the Ring's inscription. Both times, the room darkens and his usually kind voice becomes heavy and sinister.

There's a lot more to support Black Speech's inherent evil, but this comment is already turning into an essay, so I'll leave it there.

**** So I've seen a couple different renditions of Parsletongue. Some fics have it as a rare genetic trait, others a common genetic trait, and others (my favorite theory) as a language that can be learned. If it's the latter 2, there's a good amount of Parslemouths (though there might be few in the UK for whatever reason).

I've also seen different ways to how Parsletongue interacts w/ animals. With some, it converts the animal's base instincts into a human-understandable form. With others, it acts as a control system for snakes. The first means the basilisk wouldn't be easy to control, the latter essentially means all snakes are super easy to control.

My personal favorite is learnable parsletongue that allows u to control Snakes (by devoting a portion of your magic, you turn the snake into the equivalent of a remote-ctonrolled spy drone), in which case the Basilisk is very easy to control. But it depends on the fic.

EDIT: re-inferi, now that i think of it, I agree with you. Inferi are more constructs than animals.

After all, the Boa in the zoo tells Harry that it's getting back to Brazil.

** [Warning Headcanon Alert]

Nothing in the Magical World is inherently dark, it is what the Wizard makes it. Some Wizard designed Magic spells that hurt people, disfigure people, and cripple people, therefore the Spells are considered Dark. And therefore most of those are grouped up in the 'Dark Magic' category. Now, this 'Dark Magic' is not nearly as powerful as say "Battle-Magic" (Specialized Spells that also serve to Defeat/Destroy/Incapacitate another being) but it is the equivalent of using an item that is Powerful in Early Game (and somewhat Powerful even later on) but becomes relatively obscure compared to the greater options once you train up, this is even further expressed with how much easier it is to cast 'Dark Magic' in canon.

So great, I managed to classify the Magic, but does it apply to The Basilisk? The Basilisk is created through sitting a toad on a chicken's egg, not really inherently Dark, but I guess the Wizard setting it up has the intent to make a Killing Machine, so he makes it Dark in a way. But, the Basilisk isn't a simple Spell, it is also a sentient creature, and it never really hurts anyone until it was ordered to do so by its master. So we have to look at it from the 'Dog' standpoint. If the Owner is bad, then it's highly likely that the Dog will turn out to be mean and bad to others as well, not because it wants to, but because that's all it knows. So if it doesn't know it's being bad, is it still technically committing bad acts? Especially when it's the will of their master. Technically, they think they're in the moral right because they're following orders like a good boy.

** No, just like no child (no matter what Christians believe!) is born with original sin! A child, no matter how it was conceived (rape, dark magic, a loving couple having sex, some scientist cloning a child etc. etc.), is an innocent and from here on out it's a nuture thing! If you train/indoctrinate a child to be a spoiled, narcisistic and evil brat than the child will probably become that, but if you raise it in a loving environment and don't indoctrinate it? Well, then that child will grow up normally and most likely become a productive member of society!

The same applies to a basilisk! Hell, the one at Hogwarts was to be used as a last resort defense and only Tom Riddle corrupted it by using it to kill innocent children (it's lucky that he only managed to kill one person and that he had to send it back to hibernation because they would have otherwise closed Hogwarts, which he of course didn't want!)

What you said is completely contradictory to your original statement. First, let's take a step back. You generalised a whole group of people into a single pigeon hole, good job? Next, you claim that no matter how a child is conceived it is pure of heart, so technically, you have a Neo-Conservative (the 'Christians' you're referring to) point of view on abortion. Bit hypocritical, dontcha' think?

It might be true, but there's nothing in Canon to suggest that.
