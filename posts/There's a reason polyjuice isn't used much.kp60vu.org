Drinking polyjuice compels you to act like the person whose face you are wearing. Explains why people don't use it much, and makes for good humour


** I was always surprised how the fuck Barty Crouch Jr was able to fool Mad-Eye Moody's old war mate Albus Dumbledore into believing that he was speaking with the real Moody...

*** Because Crouch Jr might be a death eater, but also an exceptionally smart cookie. 12 Newts I believe? He managed to fool his parents into thinking he was a dutiful son, rather than running around with racist terrorists? Some occlumency and acting skills don't seem amiss in such a type.

Also: would the real Alastor Moody really throw around unforgivables because the kids need to know about them? They are very dark magic, aren't they? Would the real Alastor Moody do that in front of two kids that lost their parents to those cursus? Dumbledore & OotP colleagues lost the plot not realising this.

**** Probably, but I feel like someone like Moody would have definitely learned Occlumency. Then again, he managed to get captured, so IDK

***** Occlumency isn't some random ass thing you can just pick up out of nowhere unlike in basically every fanfic ever. It took Snape, Dumbledore and Voldemort decades to master it so that their mind was impenetrable

******* He probably believed that Harry could learn enough to stave off the connection between him and Voldemort. This is all guesswork and even if Moody learnt occlumency, there is still veritaserum and we also don't know if Crouch Jr was a stronger legilimens

*** My headcannon is that Crouch Jr. was an up-an-coming actor in wizarding theater before becoming a death eater. He's just really talented at method-acting. Combine that with some magical interrogation and some of the over-the-top paranoia Moody was famous for and fooling a very busy Dumbledore suddenly seems a lot more plausible. The bonus here is that this explanation helps flesh out Jr.'s character background, and the bad guy simply being competent is a much more satisfying explanation that whatever 'Greater-Good' conspiracy or magical shenanigans is needed to get Dumbledore to overlook an imposter.

**** Bonus theory: he actually has a very successful acting career in the Muggle world under the pseudonym of David Tennant. The reason he joined Voldemort is that he wants him to subjugate the Muggle world so he can openly use magic to improve his performances

** Yeah, I was always surprised that wizards didn't use it that often. I mean, if a second-year could make it, it can't be that hard for an adult, right? Even if said second year was Hermione Granger.

*** Wizarding World said that the Polyjuice Potion is "best left to highly skilled witches and wizards" and that "the fact that Hermione is able to make a competent Polyjuice Potion at the age of twelve is testimony to her outstanding magical ability, because it is a potion that many adult witches and wizards fear to attempt", so I don't think most adult wizards could brew it. Also, even if they could, the effects of a poorly brewed one are lethal at worst and can take weeks to undo at best, so they probably aren't desperate enough to use it often.

I need a crack fic of this. Just her inner monologue as she deals with disaster after disaster from canon and fanfic both.

Pretty much chapter 2 of this, although it's quite a dark story.

  In 1978, Sirius Black almost becomes an Auror. Turns out even he can't fake his way through the mental health assessment.So what. He has better things to do: Remus Lupin is one. The war is another. He spends weeks at a time undercover for the Order while Polyjuiced to the gills. It's probably his new favourite thing.Little does Sirius know that running from himself will send him on a collision course with his ephemeral brother, but life is funny that way.
