:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
All that I can remember is that in one Snape needs a virgin to brew a very specific and very old potion and the only one who's qualified enough and still a virgin is Hermione. The potion has something to do with Order work, but I really can't remember more specifics.[FOUND]

The other one is one where Snape and Hermione are working on a cure/treatment for the Cruciatus curse and basically end up with Cruciatus in potion form. After one girl in Snape's class sabotages her friends potion, the potion explodes right next to the "cruciatus in a vial" and coats Hermione with it. The treatment is being used by all of the order and they have to use it on her and it involves a lot of freezing and warming the nerve endings and something along those lines. They wrap her up in lots of blankets after a freezing bath and place her in front of the fire place. The order also takes turns watching over her and warming her.[FOUND]

This other Snape is tasked with brewing something for Voldemort that will help him become more powerful but keeps giving excuses as to why his potions are not working. Simultaneously, he's working with Hermione on this other potion to give the Dark Lord instead. This potion has micro particles of something(I think it was a very rare plant) that will explode upon activation literally obliterating Lord Voldemort.[FOUND]

As you can see I love potions haha, some might be the same and overlap and I'm just confusing things, but I got really hung up on the potion side of things so I don't really remember the rest of the plot. It might not be three fanfics. Counting on you to save my forgetful ass.

Thanks in advance ;)


** I'm, sadly, not aware of the fics you mentioned.

Although, if you are interested in SS/HG, I would recomend checking out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5751039/corvusdraconis][corvusdraconis]]. The author has a fuck-ton of good-quality fics (although they do tend to suffer from a similar plot and a hint of Lily/James bashing and in general hints of bashing. It really depends on the fic).

  Severus Snape and Hermione Granger deal with traumas past and present and find they have more in common than they realize as they prepare for the ultimate confrontation with Voldemort. SSHG pairing. Not HBP compliant. This is a novel length story.

** Are these fics really old? I wanna say I've read those first two but we're talking like 12-15 years ago...? In which case, it might be worth looking around the old witchfics dot org site. You'll have to [[https://web.archive.org/web/20151209122636/http://www.witchfics.org/][use the Wayback Machine]] to do it, tho.

If it wasn't that long ago, then it's probably ringing a bell for me from the Ashwinder archive. I think their registration system is still under maintenance, and their search feature has never been great, but if you can remember any more deetz then I could trawl the usual suspects in that archive. If you haven't favorited her yet, [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewuser.php?uid=2560][southern_witch_69]] has a bunch of great fics and her favorites lists are full of gold.
