I was wondering what fics best portray dark and/or light magic the best, thank you.


** linkffn(6939995) is one of those rare fics in which Light or White Magic is explored.

  1957 A tree in Albania, she said. Straightforward enough, right? Not if someone else got there first. Tom's journey in acquiring the vessel for his fifth Horcrux just got that much trickier. An exploration of White Magic. Canon-compliant. Longshot. OC

** Story: The odds were never in my favour [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11517506/67]]

The best type that's written in this one is the more grey type magic, but the dark magic is well written.

Another notable one is The Last Peverell.

** One of my favorites is Evitative linkao3(20049589), it's descriptions of dark magic and the culture/traditions around it are amazing. One thing to note though is it has slash(Drarry) so don't read if you want to avoid that.

  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.

  Tom is three years old when Mary, his twin sister, is taken from him. After eight solitary years at Wool's Orphanage, he learns that he shall see her again at Hogwarts, a school of magic. Will their reunion be a peaceful one, or will they travail through seven years of waxes and wanes, through which their world becomes increasingly torn by war and desire?
