I know, weird request. I really enjoy darker stories, but most of the time they either get incredibly gory or horribly sad. Neither one I am a fan of because, well, I cry. I'm a legit story sobber. I have ruined several books with my uncontrollable tears haha.

I would prefer if the world itself is the darker element in the story, though I am by no means limiting my request to that. Stories following Dark!characters or Good!characters in a dark environment are both welcomed. I want a story that grabs me by its claws and chews my mind. Does that make sense? Probably not, but I hope so.

*Please no*: harems, multi, or threesomes. HP/HG is my least favorite pairing, unfortunately.

Everything else is fair game. No preference on main characters and I love reading about both straight and gay pairings.

Thanks so much in advance, I'm excited for any and all recommendation ya'll have!


** "Cuckoo Boy" linkffn(10648740). It's a fairly quick read, but quite interesting.

  Draco knew from the moment he held his infant son, Scorpius, in his arms that something wasn't right about him. But Albus Severus Potter didn't realize how "wrong" Scorpius was until it was too late for everyone -- not just him. Two-Shot.

** You want to read this: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9097983/1/Without-Thorn-the-Rose]]) It's very AU but completely brilliant.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11700860/1/The-Heir]])

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11476491/1/The-Dark-Mage-s-Captive]]) From what I remember this might suit. Been a while since I read it though.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6018171/1/The-Fine-Art-of-Poisoning]]) Very dark, very creepy, not particularly sad. Canon compliant, I think.

  Hermione Granger's life is forever changed one night by an innocuous spell and a timely Professor. KindaPureblood!Hermione and Not Quite a Marriage Law. I just could't get my tropes right. Either way, the resident Know-It-All and the Bat of the Dungeon collide in this AU, SS/HG story about what happens when you're related to the Dark Lord. Cover art by Freya Ishtar.
