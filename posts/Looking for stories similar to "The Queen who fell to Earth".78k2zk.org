It doesn't have to necessarily focus on dragons or other non-human races. What I'm looking for is cooperation on large scale between wizards and normals, with normal humans poking into the wizarding world or even official attempts or preparations for dismantling SoS.

The story I mentioned: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7591040/]]


** The beginning of that is happening in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20) but then it got abandoned

EDIT: Is the author for The Queen Who Fell to Earth dead? Being serious, profile says they have lung cancer but that was last year.

Yes. He died April 2016 in his sleep, if I remember correctly.
