** Well, the Hilux might work, if it's 1998 model or later. Otherwise, it'll rust away in seven minutes ðŸ˜³

**** So, where you're from, the rocker panels, and the bottom of the doors don't get eaten by the ferocious rust demons, at the speed of sound?

Huh. Learn something new every day, I guess.

Mechanically, they are some of the best cars ever made. I mean, the engines are so under powered, they are practically impossible to destroy.

Up here in Iceland, it's the rust that eventually brings even the most heroic Hilux to their knees ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜­ which is too bad, because I adore those cars!

***** Ah yeah where I live we don't salt the roads, and I don't live at the coast so I never had rust problems lol.

And yeah the 22re was an underpowered little Toyota tractor engine, but god damn that thing will run forever. And they are SOOOOO EASY to work on.

I never did get my hands on a 22ret, but I ended up doing an OM617 swap anyways it was a Mercedes diesel if you aren't familiar with it

****** We had a 1982 Hilux when I was younger, and it had a petrol enhine in it, presumably the 22. I swear, whenever we came to a hill, the car would laugh and say: "I hope you brought some supplies, because we are going to be here a while."

My dad finally had enough and put un an engine from a Toyota Crown, and it was much better after that.

Yes, cars used to be very easy. We used to have a Å koda 105, and my dad always had an engine handy, because they would overheat, and go bad really easily. It took like 20 minutes to swap out the engine. It was tiny, had a couple of plugs and was held in place with four bolts.

******* If it was an 82, it had a 22r in it. Essentially the same engine as the 22re, just with slightly less powered and carberated instead of fuel injected
