Her name is Jane Eveni Heavens and she is from Slytherin

BACKSTORY: She was born on July 23, 1980. The day she was born, she was left at the door of an orphanage on a very rainy day. She grew up there, it was a bad place and she was lonely and bullied.

Until one day she saw a boy her age practicing magic. He used a wand and was with a friend trying to turn an apple from an orange into an alley. Jane saw this from the orphanage window and went after the boys. In pursuit, one of the boys ended up dropping his wand and a Lembrol from his backpack. He only realized he dropped it when he arrived at his home in Godric's Hollow. His father was an auror, so he found out what his son did very quickly.

When the two boys went to the Ministry, they would only be scolded. However, an investigation had to be initiated because the wand and Lembrol fell

One person was sent to the orphanage to retrieve the wand and the remembrance. When the person entered, Jane was startled and cast an accidental spell with her wand.

She was taken to the Ministry and said she was dropped off at the orphanage on her birthday with just a note saying her name. The name "Eveni Heavens" shocked everyone because Eveni was a great witch and supposedly a psychic. After another investigation, it was discovered that Jane was the daughter of Eveni and her husband Ethan Heavens.

The boy who dropped the wand and the memol is her cousin, because the boy's father was Ethan's brother. The boy´s name is Matthew and the friend is Edward. She also met the maternal family, a wealthy family and higher than the Malfoys and the Blacks in the wizarding hierarchy, but the Filliesters were much more pleasant and powerful and Jane was trained to reach her level of power.

HP TIME: As mentioned earlier, she is in the same year as Harry and was selected for Slytherin. Jane managed to get along with many Slytherin children, except for Malfoy's gang. Matthew was also selected for Slytherin but Edward was sent to Durmstrang

When Voldemort returned and the Ministry refused to believe it, the aurors of Jane's maternal and paternal families resigned and went to the Order of the Phoenix. Jane found out about Dumbledore's army when she read Ron's mind legitimately and tried to get in and succeeded, because she threatened to reveal to the school about the army (something she wouldn't do). Matthew and other Slytherin students who were against Voldemort also entered

At the battle of Hogwarts, the 2 fought. Matthew was killed by Bellatrix and the Jane survived.

EPILOGUE: She married a slytherin boy and have three kids.

She tries to help Harry in the Trizard Tourment but Harry denies 3. She is in the battle in the Mistery Departament 4. She know the truth about Sirius 5. She is Teddy Lupin's godmother 6. She is a prefect

****** You should try out a fanfic! If you like developing characters, I think you'd enjoy writing with them. Maybe try a few scenes to see how they interact with the world. You get to know your characters better when you seem in action.
