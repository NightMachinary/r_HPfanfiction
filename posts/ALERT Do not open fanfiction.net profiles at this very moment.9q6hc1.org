*** I'm not the most tech literate, either, but there's a number of reasons that someone might do this. It could be anything from an overzealous ao3 supporter as suggested by others, or just someone who hates Critics United doing a false flag, or it could just as easily be a script kiddie just trying to get some practise in with a relatively harmless prank. It's kind of dumb that someone would do it, but it's also kinda funny when you think about it. Ultimately, it looks really bad for the fictionpress admins and makes them look even more incompetent, since there's a bit of a meta issue surrounding the functionality of their websites.

***** It's really the billions of tags that sucks. I think AO3's filtering system is pretty good but invariably there's like twelve fics per page that have 50 tags, half of which don't even make any sense to people stumbling onto the fic. Like, really? Do you have to tag every character, every genre, every concept and theme you have in your fic? It's honestly the biggest eyesore.

****** Yeah, I think really the one advantage I'd give ff.net over Ao3 (from a reader perspective) is that the limited amount of characters you can tag means that when looking for fics about a certain character, I can actually find fics about that character, rather than fics where that character says one line in chapter 13.

I have found the new "exclude crossovers" option on Ao3 to help with this problem, oddly enough. An awful lot of fics with a million tagged characters end up being cross-fandom drabble series or whatnot. (Though I suppose that's not much help if you're looking for crossovers, admittedly.)

******* My problem is, my primary fandom has been going on for a few decades, spanning multiple iterations in the process. Thus, it has a tag for each series, and then a catch-all tag. It's not uncommon for a fic to be tagged with its series tag and the general tag, which means excluding crossovers is functionally useless.

At least it doesn't have the sheer volume that a bunch of other fandoms do though.

If I'm searching for, say, Torchwood fics and choose the exclude crossovers option, it still pulls up fics that are also tagged with Doctor Who, Sarah Jane Adventures, and/or Class, but not stuff tagged with Supernatural or whatever.

*** Ok so: Code (computer instructions) is simply text like you would be reading on the internet. However, code that your computer is willing to execute is generally much more tightly secured than arbitrary text on the internet. For example, profiles/fics can be created by just about anyone, but the code to actually display the website is relatively hard to change.

When you can getting a computer to execute that are generally supposed to be considered payload (like text for a website) as instructions is generally called an injection attack. Why would people do it? Well, if they trick your computer into thinking the instructions come from a more trusted source, they have all the permissions that the more trusted source has. You can do some nasty things with javascript if you want: Keyloggers (to record passwords), rendering ads or malsites into the page when it loads, or whathave you.

Or even worse, javascript can then use other exploits to try to download worse bugs to your computer. If they could use javascript to convince your computer it is running native code instead of website code, well then you can do pretty much anything you want with that PC. Add it to a botnet, install ransomware, etc.

'course, usually when these exploits are discovered, they are used for some petty trolling activity, and quickly get patched. At least the ones you hear about. The ones you don't hear about can end up saved in some database somewhere for strategic use by criminals/government agencies/others who want to break into other peoples stuff.

NOTE: The fact that a profile page can have arbitrary javascript doesn't really make it any less safe than any other untrusted website on the web (you know, all those sites google says 'you really don't want to visit these'). If you are patched and up to date, it is probably pretty unlikely they will break into more than just rendering a bad page to your screen. Not that it makes comparing a website that (I assume) most of us trust with the scummy infected sites you avoid on the web is not something the owners of ff.net want

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/9q5gob/alert_do_not_check_any_user_profiles_on_ffn/e87itez]]

Saying something about it spreading as it's brute forcing edit requests while the cursor is over an infected part of the page. Also I'm not sure if the app would use the same login cookie as the website one (not a web developer).

So I dunno maybe not ?

What's odder is I can't seem to figure out how this /spreads/, if it even does so. Oh, it definitely overwrites your bio, posts reviews, etc. -- but I'm not seeing where it embeds the script into other bios.

Not sure if the script has changed since initial reports or if it's just people getting confused between the spam/bio-edit and an actual self-spreading script (read: virus). I'm also not bored enough to go through the trouble of creating a new account just to test it.

** *Updates from the original* [[https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/9q5gob/alert_do_not_check_any_user_profiles_on_ffn/e87itez][thread]]

#1 It's spreading via inserting the code into your profile page using your login cookie as a vector

#2 It's editing people's profile pages to say "I support Critic's United" (yes probably [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Critics_United][these]] [[https://encyclopediadramatica.rs/Critics_United][idiots]])

#3 Since it needs a valid login cookie to work clearing all [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] cookies THEN quitting your browser should protect you against it.

#4 If this is making you more paranoid then Mad Eye Mooney on a bender with Snape then use [[https://pdfmyurl.com/]]

This website will make a PDF of the profile page with clickable links that should defeat the hack (in theory)
