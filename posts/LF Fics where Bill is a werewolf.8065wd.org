Any fics where instead of being scarred, Bill is bitten by Greyback. and it effects his relationship will Fleur and his family. Also wouldn't mind if he bonds with Lupin over it (but no slash please).


** I don't think I have ever read a story where Bill is a werewolf, but I recall reading a fic where the story emphasizes how a bit of lycanthropy affects him and Fleur. This story takes place during the Deathly Hallows and is about what Bill, Fleur, Percy, and Audrey did during the war. Charlie and Oliver is also in the fic as well.
