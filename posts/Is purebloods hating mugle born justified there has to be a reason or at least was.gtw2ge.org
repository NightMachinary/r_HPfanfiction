In my opinion it is eluded to that the mugles and wizards fought in a war and maybe some mugleborns sided with mugles and shifted the ballance which made the wizards lose and this is why what's your opinion on this theory


** Well, in modern times, hatred against muggles and muggleborns by proxy is nothing more than racism, but I get the sense that it partially originates from muggles persecuting wizards centuries ago when muggles still believed in magic and feared those who wielded it (think Nearly Headless Nick's backstory). In modern times, muggles are mostly ignorant of magic, so hatred of them is racism rooted in a lack of understanding and the belief that muggles are basically animals in comparison to wizards.

** Canonically, Voldemort's movement is pretty much just magical Nazis.

In fanfiction it is common to see pure-blood opposition to Muggleborns based on Muggleborns not understanding or seeking to change "wizarding culture". In canon, this view is not very present. We only get a glimpse of it in PS:

#+begin_quote
  “I really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you? They're just not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What's your surname, anyway?”
#+end_quote

JKR pretty much abandons this line in CoS and thereafter doubles down on pure-blood supremacy being an entirely racial doctrine, probably to avoid complex moral and political problems in a children's book. Far better if the villains are 100% irredeemably evil.

Nonetheless, for more adult fanfiction, the cultural angle is an interesting one. An analogy can be drawn between Muggleborns and immigration and for real life debates around cultural integration/multiculturalism to play out in wizarding society.

Of course, most fanfic authors just deploy the idea as a way to uncritically make pure-bloods 100% right so they can have Harry switch sides and then bash Dumbledore etc. All the interesting debates are thereby avoided - including the interesting /disanalogy/ that Muggleborns are /born/ with magic, therefore arguably are natural citizens of the magical world, not "immigrants".

An alternative angle, one which I have taken in Victoria Potter, is to equate pure-blood doctrine with traditional classism or, if you want something more extreme, the Indian caste system.

These days we are used to thinking of social status as something that is a product of your other characteristics: wealth, political power, fame, talent, etc. But it was not long ago that the world viewed social status as its own, independent characteristic: each person had a set status determined by the circumstances of their birth, and this was just part of who a person was, like their eye colour.

This is what people always miss when they say things like "How could any reasonable pure-blood continue to believe in the supremacy of pure-bloods in the face of Muggleborns doing just as well as them, or better than them, at magic?" The question is an anachronism, imposing our modern sense of merit determining a person's status on the traditional idea of each person having a set "station". Traditional ideas of class do not depend on merit; it is *not* a contradiction to believe that pure-bloods are better than Muggleborns and that Muggleborns can outperform pure-bloods in magical tests. For these people, class is its own characteristic, independent of talent, and no amount of talent can give you class.

In this class-based approach, the focus is not so much on being /against/ Muggleborns as it is about being /in favour/ of the superiority of your own social class. Anti-Muggleborn prejudice is a by-product of pure-blood supremacy, not its principal doctrine - they are the bottom rung of a long ladder of social hierarchy, barely even worth mentioning because they are so low down/small in number.

In Victoria Potter, I have the family-focused class-based approach (the "traditionalist" approach) contrasted with the radical individual-focused philosophy of Voldemort & Co. - pure-bloods being divided as to which is correct.

**** You can have nuanced stories without whitewashing Racism and Nazi ideology. Trying to invent reasons for the hatred of mugleborns doesn't make a story nuanced - it makes it "both sides".

Even in a story where, as in canon, the pureblood bigotry is not redeemable, you don't have to paint everything black and white. When I wrote Divided and Entwined, there was never a doubt that Voldemort was wrong - but that didn't make everyone fighting him right. There were quite understandable reasons for some to pick up a wand and fight the muggleborns - like when their family and friends get killed by muggleborns.

But making up stuff about cultural invaders and such? That's not needed.

And again, the whole point of mentioning Tibet is to point out it situations like it exists irl.

And the whole cultural angle... If some wizards are concerned about being out populated and thus the loss of Wizarding customs, then they're in their right to be concerned. Do I agree with methods being used by wacko extremist? No. There are other ways of going about it. Like someone else mentioned in comments further up, classes or get togethers helping keep whatever customs alive.

But anyways, I doubt that's the whole reason these wars, Grindelwald's War and Voldemort's Wars, happen. It's clear some anxiety of Wizardkind is being exploited. After all, these are a people that essentially live in hiding. They have been living that way since the Statute of Secrecy was signed.

Not necessarily. Ignorance leads to hate and racism, as well as other kind of isms that are not good in the world.

People like Salazar Slytherin and Riddle Jr (as well as others), sprouted out against Muggleborns. While there might not be as many Purebloods in the next 50 years or so, if they didn't have relationships with Half-Bloods, Muggleborns and Muggles, Magic will become near extinct. But what many Pureblood Fanatics were taught, makes it the opposite, be that Muggleborns and the like, will kill the magic.

** There doesn't necessarily have to be a valid reason. But I assume there might be historical reasons and I could very well imagine that the whole thing developed out of Grindewald‘s movement. I'd imagine that in Grindelwald‘s war, which seems a bit more justified than Voldemort's cause with how wizards have to live in hiding and everything, muggle borns would have fought on the muggle side. In wars, people often dehumanize the other side to make it easier to fight (and kill them) and it's hard to get rid of such a mindset once it has developed.
