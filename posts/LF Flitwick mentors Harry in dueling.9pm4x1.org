So I really like more fleshed out dueling with spell combos and dodging. So is there a story where Flitwick thinks that Harry has potential and starts mentoring him after the troll or later. Searching for a longer story, in progress or finished, but please not abandoned. Please not a massive romance plot, if theres a pairing alright but no slash. Would prefer no crossover, but I will not exclude them.

#+begin_quote
  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

**** Its still in the air whether or not it is abandoned, the author has a really strange habit of starting stories with sensible length chapters released fairly frequently but the longer the story goes they stop releasing chapters for a year or two and then dump an immensely long chapter on you. You basically have to reread the story every time a new chapter comes out to remind yourself of the story. This story started decently and it could still turn out ok, but its at the point that in nearly 300k words that is mostly dedicated to like a week of actual time and keeps getting bogged down instead of actually progressing the story. I did enjoy it the first time I read it but I can absolutely understand why someone wouldn't want to start it.

** Oh, god, this is killing me.

There's an author whose heyday was some time ago (2010-2012) and was famous for making really overpowered Harry stories. The story had to do with magical emails that students could send each other, but as the story went on, it became less about the emails and more about the fact that, because Harry was such a blockhead and believed he could do anything with magic, he could do anything with magic.

Harry stops half-way through his first apparition, and takes a look around. Because he apparates so much more slowly, he is able to apparate into and out of hogwarts through holes in the wards.

I'm pretty sure he got training from Flitwick in this fic, although I'm not certain.

Do Harry and Hermione get training from Flitwick in linkffn(vox corporis)? There's one where they go to a stony valley and blow the shit out of rocks too.
