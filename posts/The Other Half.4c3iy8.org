Okay, so I finally decided to write my own Harry Potter fanfic, with the help of a friend. We kicked around some ideas and this is what we came up with (link below). I hope this isn't ripping off a story that someone has already written, and if it is, I greatly apologize! I do hope that you will take the time to read it though! Thanks in advance!

*** I can give you one! All true fans know how devastated George was after Fred's death. Harry and Ron try to figure out a way to help him :)
