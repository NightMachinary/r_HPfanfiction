In my opinion cho has so much untapped potential by the community as a parring option for harry

1 if she is written as getting over Cedric and wanting to fight back she has a lot of potential for character development

2 if she says yes to harry and goes to the Yule ball you outright avoid weepy cho which people hate.

their are already hints they both like each other Cedric just got their first in Canon

2 harry and Parvati also have potential as they went to the Yule ball you just have to write that harry actually pay attention to her and give her an interesting backstory.

3Harry and Daphne I don't like Daphne as I feel her character in character in fandom NEVER changes from Girl in slytherin who has every political connection ever . She is the only one in slytherin who acts with discretion. She takes control of Harry's life because only she can help him.

These are MY opinions feel free to disagree


** The problem is that you have to make them practically OCs for those pairings to work, and at that point what's the point of calling her Cho? (Or Parvati, or Daphne?)

There isn't much appeal to Cho's actual character. It's not "untapped potential" when you straight-up have to invent or import all the potential.

**** What does Ginny have to do with Cho's utter blandness as a character, again?

She's a caricature created to be a temporary love interest.

****** So? Even if I agreed with you, that would just make them /both/ bland, badly-written characters with no potential. At least Ginny had an actual storyline, what with being possessed by Riddle, going to the ball with Neville, and being at least above average in terms of raw power if not skill. What plot does Cho contribute apart from "now I'm Cedric's girlfriend, now I'm snogging Harry"? Hell, Marietta of all people is more important to the overarching plot.

"A better Ginny" my actual foot. What the hell was "Expellimellious"?

******** Why are you so hung up on Ginny? She has approximately 0 relevance to this situation.

You seem hellbent on convincing me that Ginny is also a bad choice for Harry; I've already answered you - /so the hell what?/ How does the existence of other badly-written characters increase Cho's relevance or make her interesting in any way?

Like Lavender, she's a caricature of a pop culture representation of a teenage girl. She's a plot device and an irrelevant one at that. Both of them basically exist to be a token first crush before their love interests find true love. And you can lift both of them wholesale from the narrative without changing a damn thing, they're that badly tacked-on. Oh wait, Lavender actually had /more/ plot relevance because to remove her you'd have to find another reason for Ron and Hermione to be at each other's throats for half of HBP.

I mean, what do we even know about Cho the character? She:

- plays Quidditch

- cries a lot

- stammers basic spells around her crush

- ...her Patronus is a swan?

Not that there's anything wrong with those things in isolation or even together, but what's attractive?

**** Except there are pairings that actually have interactions and tensions beyond "this character was created to be Harry's temporary love interest and immediately fall into obscurity once she's fulfilled her role"

Hell Hagrid x Madame Maxime is a more interesting pairing and she has like twenty lines in the entire series

***** You can extrapolate a lot of Madame Maxime though. Half giant = discrimination, but she still manages to become headmistress of the most prestigious magic school in France meaning she is either ruthless or highly intelligent etc.

Cho is just a pretty girl Harry likes.

****** Exactly. I mean, Maxime is relevant to the plot even if Hagrid didn't exist, or they hated each other on sight. As a mentor to Fleur, as the headmistress of Beauxbatons, showing clear support in the fight against Voldemort.

Cho on the other hand...she...plays Quidditch? Is she any good at it? Who knows?

its "THERE"... ffs man. I can't read this without pointing it out. Heil Grammar!

But regarding your post. All three of them are basically blanks. We don't really know anything about Cho other than shes pretty and that she is in love with Cedric, hence her griefing in the fifth book.

Parvati is also a blank. We know about as much about her as we know about Cho. She likes Divination, she hangs with Lavender and a few other tidbits.

Daphne is the blank-slate on the edge of OC. We know literally nothing besides her name, her sister, her bloodstatus and her house. Thats it.

So if you call "blank space" untapped potential, then I'm in total agreement.

*** I mean you could conceivably make Parvati a Seer, or maybe Padma's the Seer and Parvati has to deal with her jealousy

But what can you actually write about Cho that isn't more or less completely made-up? Apart from getting her with Cedric or Harry. Like...what do she and Harry even talk about?

** 1) I just don't find Cho that interesting. I usually just use her character as a means to an end. 2) Harry/Parvati could work, but your'd have to develop her character beyond a gossiping girl who loves to read horoscopes. 3) Daphne is just a girl from a different house with a different perspective on the world. That could be interesting, but there's very few fics out there that do it properly without relying on badly written political stuff, or without calling her an ice queen.

** Probably because she's not exciting enough - she's not a veela, she's not some snarky slytherin. She's a popular girl who had a perfect boyfriend. While she's athletic, pretty, and smart, she doesn't have enough OC appeal that could be solely crafted by an author, and she also lacks enough description to do anything radical with.

I personally like Cho and wish she had some better development, whether canon or fanon. Most fics I've read with Cho have her as some asian stereotype, the bullying popular girl, or a crying mess.
