Ok so the idea is; I'm making a story and Harry can either have Parseltongue or be a Metamorphmagus, and I'm in mental ruin trying to decide between them.

My idea starts with Harry being raised in Hogwarts, so he grows up with and around the older students. Nymphadora in particular and he considers her a big sister.

The goal is that he be considered part of the Hogwarts experience. Both Parseltongue and Metamorphmagusness can contribute to this in different ways.

Metamorphmagus;

I imagine him running around in his invisibility cloak and if caught his cloak hood is pulled of and he has a different face every time, like a Scooby doo villain. And he acts like one too.

He and Tonks shift into Snape and Dumbledore dress in drag. And/or they both shift into Dumbledore and sincerely interrogate students on the state of their socks, and then Dumbledore catches on and joins in. Like pictures the Dumbledore squad pulling up during a hallway like the Heathers

It could be used as a gateway for him to form relationships with other characters

Could be explained away if Dorea Potter n√©e Black is his grandmother.

He'd fit into being both a main character and being a side character pretty well. Like he could be a regular accomplice to Fred and George and at the same time be doing his own shenanigans.

I have a Selkie family I'm having him be friends with, if he can just shift to have gills then that fixes a lot of my problems, but if not then I can figure something else out (so, not essential)

His idea of gender would be quite loose, like identifies and a boy but he doesn't mind being a girl so he changes now and again. He is still only called Harry though

I'd have to figure out the parameters of how much he can shift. Like how small he can go, how big, if he can shift into animals ( meaning consciously changing his bone structure and organs), if he could make himself have muscles, give himself hawk eyes, if he could make eyes appear on like a hand so he can see around a corner, if he can stretch etc- this would be explained by nymphadora.

He might have episodes of derealisation where he thinks he's other people (people don't realise he's not the person he shifted into) or he thinks he's a bird, or that he doesn't have bones in his wrist because his body is constantly shifting . No this scenario no one would notice. I'm not sure on this idea though.

He could find a way to go into paintings, and aided by his shapeshifting he could fit in and have tea parties and fence with the portraits and fit in and have fun

Parseltongue;

Every snake in the castle would be sentient (drawings, sculptures, tapestries and artworks) and talk and do what he says. So they're all over the castle, listening. Harry knows everything about every one and no one knows why.

Opens up complicated relationships with the Slytherins. So it would show Harry getting close with them and their struggle with (maybe) accepting Muggleborns, switching sides in the war, and if their relationships is mutual and the Slytherins are being genuine.

He would basically know all the secret passageways. So him under his invisibility cloak, the paintings on his side (looking out for students/teacher) and the secret passageways, he's basically untouchable and can get into anywhere. This could be used for a lot of things

Would mean the Horcrux wasn't very well removed, like there's residue leftover. This could be a point of conflict when Harry starts questioning which thoughts are his and what aren't. (Horcrux isn't sentient, Harry hits a moment of delusion where he thinks his brain might be corrupted/tainted/turning into Tom Riddles brain)

In the Dursley's he's neglected and left in pitch-black his closet for 22 hours a day. So he has a few issues.

He wouldn't spend as much time in Hogwarts, going there when he's five or something

He would be friends with the Basilisk so it won't be the big bad in second year.

Dumbledore would pay a closer attention to him/ mentor-tutor him in secret from third year upwards

This would be a darker story if you couldn't already tell

I'm really at a loss between the 2. I have a lot of ideas but I can't really make anything of them before this is settled though.

I wrote this in the hopes that someone would choose one for me, and know all of the options potential (that I can think of).

So

Please

Choose


** Personally, I really like the metamorphmagus for the humor aspect. I feel like theres not too many humor based stories around (that's more than one shots anyway.) Both have great potential (and I'd love to read either of them) and either could turn into an amazing story. Metamorphmagus would be a step away from the most common tropes (in my opinion) and theres a lot of room to introduce new ideas with secret passage ways, pranks, relationships, etc. And if you expand the story into a more canon story line (the war particularly) it would open up a lot of avenues into near undetectable undercover work. The side effects of the ability would also be rather interesting to read about (like how Tonks is clumsy) and reminds me of a villain in The Flash that could change into other people and he did so so much that he forgot what he himself looked like.

I'd say worst comes to worst, you could hold a poll (like this tbf) and see which idea people would want to see more of. Best of luck!

** It sounds (by how you talk about it) that YOU want the metamorphmagus fic.

That being said they sound like two totally different stories so I say write both.

** Parseltongue.

Knowing everything about everyone would be hilarious. This was a hard decision though, couldn't you just do both?

*** Thanks for responding :)

The reason is because I'm not sure if you can make a character too extraordinary or too lucky. Like he's famous and the public loves him, and he's had a fun childhood, and he does well in school (cause he grew up with kids studying around him), and be very rich (only Potter vault though), and luck out with 2 rare genetic abilities, yknow?

I mean I'm gonna try hard to make him likeable but I'm not sure I can pull all that off.

** I like the metamorphagus one. There's the prankster element which I enjoy. That could turn into a crackfic very easily though.

I've seen stories where Harry uses his parseltongue ability to find out info. I guess it does sound like he's playing therapist or manipulating others with the information gained. It could be fun to see him dispute certain things though.

**** Maybe a near complete shift so he is never seen unless he feels like it so he seems like some type of ghost or spirit plus complete access near anywhere in the castle but never being caught when there seems like the perfect opportunity to introduce some aspects of complicated trust issues and trouble making never before scene

** The metamorphmagus sounds more interesting personally, but I am biased. I'm a sucker for gender fluid and trans Harry stories.

** Hm...given that choice myself? You bet I'd take the metamorphmagus talent, yes talking to snakes has its uses (hell: I'd bring a painting full of magical snakes to Hogwarts and bam, I could have them report on everything going on in the castle!), but over all you get more out of being a metamorph, especially since you can use that defensively (turn into someone else to hide!) or offensively either enhance your body or even infiltrate your enemies!
