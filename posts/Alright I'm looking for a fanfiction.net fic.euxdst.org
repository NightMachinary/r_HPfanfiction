:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It was a fourth year story that harry turned into a baby in potions class and they had to have Charlie Weasley take his place. Harry was cared for by snape and was deaf with other health problems. Bill Weasley also shows up about halfway through.


** I think I remember that fic! I mean, I cant give you the fic name, but it sounds awfully familiar. Some people (Dumbledore maybe) we're really mad that Harry wasn't going to compete in the tri wizard tournament, even though Harry was a tiny child.

** Ok I found a few possibilities. I'll admit I have not read any of these yet, but I figured a few possible matches is better than nothing. I googled a few key words from your description, and started browsing through the first user library that had matching keywords, so yeah...

The first one is probably the closest match, and the last one is not even really a match at all, but I thought the description sounded interesting.

EDIT: after reading the first chapter, I no longer think the first one is a close match. My bad...

  COMPLETE! A botched up de-aging potion and Harry suffers from the results. Now, Draco is hands full of one adorable Harry. What if Draco came to like Harry in his baby-state? Can both pretend nothing happened when Harry is back to normal?

  This isn't HB related. Harry's in his sixth year and due to a major potions accident Severus turned into a baby. Dumbledore thinks only one student is capable of taking care of baby Severus and that would be our favorite boy who lived. NO SLASH Yes spanks

** I've found a community on FFN with tons of stories involving a deaged Harry. Maybe it's somewhere on there? I don't know, I've become extremely invested in finding this story.
