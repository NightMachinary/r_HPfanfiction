You never knew you wanted it until you got it. Thanks for this recommendation, btw - I would never have read it without the advice of [[/r/hpfanfiction]]. It's so good I wanted to put a post up just for it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2680093/1/Circular-Reasoning]]

/Circular Reasoning - Torn from a desolate future, Harry awakens in his teenage body with a hefty debt on his soul. Entangled in his lies and unable to trust even his own fraying sanity, Harry fights to stay ahead of enemy machinations. Desperation is the new anthem of violence./

** Great story. I hope it will be completed in another decade or two.

** I like time travel fics. Not sure if I'll enjoy something this dark, but will give it a try. Thanks for the suggestion.

*** There's a certain point in the fic where the darker parts will prolly make you want to drop the story. But my advice is instead to sit back, detach, and chuckle in the whirlwind of fuck ups that IS this particular main character.

**** Well, I caught up. Harry the psychotic necromancer still leaves a bad taste in my mouth, but I did like the shout out to Garth Nix - I had never seen the Abhorsen's bells in HP fic before. Still too disturbed for my usual tastes, but I might just follow it to see how this poor fool eventually destroys himself and everybody else. Thanks again for the suggestion.

** I liked it, but the update rate is so slow as to make me think it dead. So I've got it watched, but intentionally forgotten about so that I don't think about how much I want it finished.

** Great story. Always makes me yearn for a proper Abhorsen/HP crossover, though.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.
