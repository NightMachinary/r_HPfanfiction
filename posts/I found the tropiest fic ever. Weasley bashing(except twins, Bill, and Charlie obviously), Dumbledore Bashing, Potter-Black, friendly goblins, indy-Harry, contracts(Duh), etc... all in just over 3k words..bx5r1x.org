This is quite possibly the most horrible, cliche HP fanfic i've ever read. Read, and bask in a story I consider almost on par with the likes of My Immortal.

** I was honestly thinking as I started to read your title that this was really not a big deal as I've seen so many of these...then I hit 3k words and was like...wait, what?

I'm honestly impressed I managed to get through this without hurling. They've taken the most tired and stale tropes and somehow made them actively worse.

I miss the time I was reading storylines like this ten plus years ago when they were fresh, and talented fanfiction authors were turning their hand to them and writing epics.

Edit: Also, how did they misspell their own title? That's literally the easiest part to get right!

**** I read the entire thing, by the 4th chapter he had a mansion island with servants and a pool, by chapter 5 he was getting married to demigod OCs because his uncle was Thor, and by the end he had like 83 wives. I wrote like a 3 paragraph review in discord, fun times.

** The review as always are hilarious retarded.

Dumbledore is egomaniac? My God are we even reading the same novel? He already abandon that mindset after her sister died.

*** I know. I can believe a greater good Dumbledore, him being the oldest, and wisest in just about any room would ensure that about anyone. I can even believe a manipulative Dumbledore, mostly because that's canon, although it all turns out alright in the end, and most people are manipulative to a degree, whether it's guilt tripping someone to go shopping with you to changing lives, we all do it. I just can't believe in an egomaniac Dumbledore, or an evil Dumbledore. He had his problems like all great leaders, and maybe it could have been done better, or differently. In the end it all worked out though.

I personally like Dumbledore, but i've read a lot of anti-Dumbledore fanfic, because it's honestly interesting to see what Harry would do when he has no old, and wise mentor. Granted i've also read the garbage ones like robst(to my everlasting shame) as well.
