And I mean, you can technically make scone pizza. I say technically because it's making a scone base for the dough, but it's basically just a differently shaped scone with no fruit bits.

I don't actually have any opinion either way, myself. I don't get the chance to eat enough pizza to really have an opinion - my family tend to prefer meaty shop-bought pizzas and the only pizza places in my town are Dominos (which is riotously expensive) and a cheap local place (which is utterly shit).

Huh, that's kinda interesting, we have this semi-cheap place that makes absolutely amazing pizzas, a few Armenian guys run it, there's also a barber shop that gets you a haircut for 5€ FIVE that's run by a few israeli guys, and they do it damn fast too, it's an amazing place

**************** Five euros? Goddamn. The cheapest place we have charged £11 for adult haircuts. Child was £6 something last I checked. Not sure how much it is now - quarantine and all. But we do have a dozen hairdressers/beauty places despite only being a town of 30,000 people. It confuses me greatly and I've lived here for nearly 20 years.

We do have a great range of take-out though - it's just the cheap pizza that's terrible. I'm very fond of the food from our local Sri-Lankan place and there's an Indian restaurant that does these ridiculously oversized kebab plates that can literally feed a person for several days. :D

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship.
