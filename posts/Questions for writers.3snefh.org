When you write fanfiction, do you publish each chapter as soon as it's finished? Or do you prefer to write ahead, so that you can go back an change things if necessary before you put the chapters online?

If you publish each chapter right away, has it happened to you that you felt the need to go back and change things, because you realised when writing later chapters that you could have dropped hints earlier/introduced certain ideas earlier? Or does this never happen to you because you plotted everything out in the beginning and stick to your plans meticulously?

Secondly: Do you read books about writing? Or think that's unnecessary? Why? Why not? If yes, which ones? (character development, how to describe emotions, books on good dialogue...) Do you have any recommendations for books about writing?

Lastly, advice on writing. We all know the most important step is to sit down and start, and that it's hardly detrimental to read lots of good books, but: What's some other helpful advice on writing you got / can give?

Anything else you want to share concerning writing and how you go about it is also welcome, even if it's not specifically aimed to answer my questions.

Usually. If I've left a cliffhanger, though, I'll wait to post until the next chapter is ready to go as well.

#+end_quote

Quite often, but that's the price to pay for impatience. I've never changed major plot points, but have instead ironed out poorly phrased descriptive passages or dialogue that didn't 'feel' right.

You're probably going to laugh, but [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danse_Macabre_%28book%29][Danse Macabre]] is quite good. For the technical aspects, you could use Eats, Shoots and Leaves, but [[http://www.amazon.co.uk/Grammar-Girls-Quick-Better-Writing/dp/0805088318][Grammar Girl]] works just as well. If you regularly read books, though, your writing will probably take on flavours of the authors you admire.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Plan everything out. Write your story's summary in one sentence. Then in a paragraph. Then in a concise summary that touches on all major plot points. Make [[http://www.hp-lexicon.org/timelines/calendars/calendar_pa.html][calendars]]. Create biographies/reference sheets for your main characters' motivations & values systems so that you know where they would stand on any future plot points.

Posting to DLP's WbA forum is a surefire way to get some really honest advice, but be prepared. They don't suffer fools.

I hope this helps. Good luck - and most importantly - /have fun/ while writing.

  Add on his On Writing
#+end_quote

[[/u/HaltCPM]] had already suggested it and I didn't want to steal their idea. And I'd agree with you that a case could be made that he's the top contemporary writer in the world, but I'm still a bit miffed at his self-insert in the Dark Tower series.

** I used to publish as soon as I finished when I first started. Nowadays, I let things sit for a while just in case I change my mind. Even then, I still do go back and change things constantly. Just little things like coming up with a way to phrase something better is enough to get me reediting entire chapters (a habit I'm trying to curb).

I do read books about writing. My favorite would be "On Writing" by Stephen King, which gives lots of general writing advice. The more specific things you mentioned I find in books/stories I enjoyed and considered good. I've never really found a book that gives you a step by step on how to write good dialogue, though some do try. It's the kind of thing that you develop with lots and lots and lots of practice. If there was an easy way, we wouldn't have so many crappy writers on ff.net I think. But yeah, I'm just one opinion so take that with a grain of salt.

Advice...hmm, there are so many. The main ones that have to be said to really new writers are: 1) Don't be afraid of using said or its corollary: Don't use too many synonyms for said. 2) Don't use too many adjectives. 3) Show, don't tell. 4) Use spellcheck. 5) Good dialogue should tell your reader everything they need to know.

** I write at least 70% and have a clear plan for the rest before posting the first chapter. After that I try and stick to regular updates, which I edit and do a final check of spelling grammar etc just before. Sometimes I might alter things, but I avoid going back to do so. I don't currently read books about writing, but I have in the past. I write for enjoyment only, and really only started posting after a request from a friend. More of the advice people give about writing is pretty common, and I wont repeat it. Most of it comes down to 'show, don't tell', and check your work. What I think a lot of people don't realize is that if your serious about writing, then it isn't a hobby anymore, it's a *job*. You need to treat it like one, with regular (long) hours, multiple drafts and proof reading, and outsider opinions on your work.

** I write the chapter, run it past my beta, then publish it. If I don't have a beta, I publish it right away.

Though I tend to go back and go over each chapter before I delete the doc from FFNet, cleaning up mistakes etc. And if a mistake is pointed out by a reviewer, I try to correct it right away.

** In my most recent story, I wrote the whole thing ahead of time. I have a terrible habit of getting bored with writing a story halfway through and just leaving it unfinished. So, I figured, if I don't actually publish any chapters before the story is completed, I wouldn't have that problem.

** I tend to write by hand, then once the story is complete I transpose it onto my laptop, editing and correcting as I go. It then goes off to my beta, further correcting, then I'll publish.

** William Strunk Jr. and E. B. White /The Elements of Style/ [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style]] is an incredible work, and explains and solves some of the many mistakes inexperienced writers make. Highly recommended to anyone who attempts to string words together.

** I've not published anything but oneshots yet. I'm working on a longer story, but I still have yet to divide it into chapters yet.

I don't read books about writing.

** So all of the things I'm about to say about publishing multi-chapter stories are going to be anecdotal because I haven't published any of them yet, but it'll be my guideline on how I /will/ do it.

I want to make sure that I have at least half of the story written down before I publish anything, then release two chapters a week (depending on length) for two reasons: in case I get slow with writing later, and because I go back and re-read/edit /every other time/ I begin a new chapter. I'm a perfectionist.

As for plans, I don't plan every single thing out. Typically any time I get an idea for a plot point I just write down a short note or a part of a passage to get the gist of it for fitting in later. Almost all of my fics start off while I'm at work with a single idea that eats away at me until I write it down, then I expand on it throughout the day. Eventually I go home and write out a section of it (because the beginning and setup are always the most fun part to me), let it sit for a day, and decide if it's something I want to make into a full fic.

I don't read any books about writing. In fact, I kind of hated reading up until when I discovered fanfiction, but writing was something I always loved.

After I've written out the main point of the story, I try to figure out why the characters are doing what they're doing, if it makes any sense, what decisions will they face and how will those decisions change them, and at the end of the story, will their motivations be the same and how will their relationships have evolved? Its a lot, I know, and I don't plan out every plot point, but I get a few of the major ones down and go from there with those goals in mind.

This was probably not helpful but it's just my two cents haha.

** I wrote two stories back when I was 12, and I updated those as soon as I finished a chapter. But I'm returning to writing 8 years later and I'm writing the entire story before I post. I'm 50,000 words in and I'm not even close to half way through part 1. So, I won't be posting for at least a year. The reason for this is because I realize there are going to be a lot of things I will want to change down the road. For instance, I just went back and deleted close to 10,000 words and re-wrote them earlier this week.

A big part of posting as soon as you finish your chapter is having other people comment and encourage you so that you don't get burnt out. If you want to finish a long story before posting any of it, I'd suggest finding someone in your life to discuss your fic with at length. I do this with my brother (my beta) as it helps me bounce ideas off of and get initial reaction to certain parts. It also keeps my interest going and it's just, and this is the important part, /fun/. My brother and I have literally spent hours at a time just discussing a single aspect of my story which keeps it fresh and enjoyable to me. So, if you have someone to talk to about your story as you write, I highly recommend it.
