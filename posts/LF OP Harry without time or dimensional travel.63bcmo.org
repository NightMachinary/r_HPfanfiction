I'm a huge sucker for stories that have an OP harry, but sometimes i just get a tad bit annoyed with how much time/dimensional/crossover tropes are in such stories. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but most of the time its just not my cup of tea.

With that said, any fics that have an OP harry that doesnt have any time or dimensional travel whatever so ever? no crossovers as well. Don't care much for Plot besides that is comprehensible. Romance is preferred(No slash or ginny) but not a must. Writing quality should be at least readable. Examples fics are;

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303194/1/Magicks-of-the-Arcane][Magicks of the Arcane]], a personal favorite

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]]

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]]

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7402590/1/Deprived][Deprived]], an all-time favorite

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4577618/Brennus][Brennus' fics]]

Bonus if the story contains other OP characters besides Harry, thanks.


** linkffn(Core Threads) has a hilariously OP Harry. At some points, it almost gets close to becoming crack.

And this one /does/ have dimensional traveling, but in a different way than usual. Late in the story, Harry gains the ability to travel through dimensions and spends some time going to different dimensions and helping out his counterparts from those worlds. He always returns to his own dimension though.

  A young boy in a dark cupboard is in great pain. An unusual power will allow him to heal himself, help others, and grow strong in a world of magic. Eventual God-like Harry, Unsure of eventual pairings. Alternate Universe, possible universe/dimension traveling in the future.

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.
