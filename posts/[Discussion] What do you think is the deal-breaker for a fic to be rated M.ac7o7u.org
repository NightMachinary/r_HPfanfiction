What is acceptable for a T rated vs M-rated story? I realize it's a rather broad question, but I've heard people say that any sex should make it M. Then what about violence?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/guidelines/]]

If you scroll down there is a hideously implemented slider that gives some idea of what its based off.

Descriptive violence is M.

*** Wow, those guidelines are more restrictive than I'd have thought. Definitely too strict. According to those ratings, none of the canon books are suitable for children under 13.

Also I find the rules regarding expletives ridiculous. By the age of nine, I could trilingually tell people to get fucked. And I was a sheltered kid.

**** I remember mandatory school lectures which would be considered borderline explicit by those standards. Hell, the movie adaption had quite some nudity and on screen sex, statutory rape even. And it was rated 6+ here in Germany.

*** But nobody seems to be following that do they? I'm asking for what's the unwritten rules that fandom have come to expect and accept with the ratings.

**** Truth be told, it doesn't matter all too much. Some people think that M = smut without plot while others aren't touching anything below M because they don't like stories without M rated content. You cannot appease everyone or appeal to them.

That being said, T is generally vague terminology (fade to black or gloss over things) while M has more detailed description which body parts are being maimed, cut off, beaten, sucked, inserted and so on. It's simply not (supposed to be) explicit. You can most certainly have sex and or violence in T rated stories, just without going into detail.

Of course, age ratings on literary works are questionable on their own.

** Implied sex/violence/strong language is T. Explicit, in detail sex (smut), in detail torture, excessive violence and killing is M. And/or.

*** If you go by the FFnet guidelines, you're describing M vs. MA (or closer to the line between M and MA).

According to fictionratings.com (which is what FFNet uses):

Rated T is: Suitable for teens, 13 years and older, with some violence, minor coarse language, and minor suggestive adult themes.

Rated M is: Not suitable for children or teens below the age of 16 with non-explicit suggestive adult themes, references to some violence, or coarse language.

Fiction M can contain adult language, themes and suggestions. Detailed descriptions of physical interaction of sexual or violent nature is considered Fiction MA.

Fiction MA (not allowed on FFnet): Content is only suitable for mature adults. May contain explicit language and adult themes.

As a side note, one of the things that those asshole groups can get your fics nuked is having MA content (though I realize it's still plentiful on FFNet). Now if you're talking about other sites like AO3 that allow explicit content that's different.

**** Well yes, the problem with FF being that the site is full of MA while there's no category for it. After I posted my comment I thought about it a little, but ultimately it doesn't really matter because it's so loosely enforced.
