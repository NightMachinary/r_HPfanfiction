Yes, this is research for a fic, and I'm very confused. It seems like every big group of the government has their own police force and I have no idea which would be called out for something like this or if it'd be some shared taskforce or something.

Please, help?

Basic idea of the sequence is that a bunch of magical bounty hunters have chased down this escaped-obscurial kid to a field outside a small town near the border of Louisiana and Mississippi. There are a couple small towns and communities in the area and a few parks/reserves, and a space center just across the border.

I'm trying to work out what Muggle Law Enforcement Agency could be 'called in' to investigate the disturbance. Like, who's jurisdiction would it be? How far out does a police force's reach reach before it becomes a Sheriff matter, for example? Or would it be troopers because it's near a border? Or would someone see the spell-lights and assume it's an illegal rave and call the Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms peeps to bust down the metaphorical doors? Or would some dispatcher call them all out?


** If it stays within the confines of a town you'd have a local force, I.e. the town police. Sheriff generally knows about most cases in their dept, but when they get involved varies with how busy they are, nature of the case, ect. If they need backup they might call reinforcements from nearby towns. If it's state property rather than town property (Ex. State gov buildings, highways) youd probably get state trooper reinforcements. If the investigation crosses state lines, then you're starting to look at national organizations like the FBI.

** It kind of depends how big the fight is. If the damage is small scale then it'll be local police, or county or state police if the location of the fight doesn't have its own local force.

If the fight is big and its doing things like knocking down buildings, setting things on fire, and destroying big areas...they're going to assume it's terrorist related into proven otherwise. In which case literally everyone will respond, so the first person on the scene will be whoever was closest, so you've got choice of whoever you want. Justify it by saying that the dispatcher put out an all units call for an ongoing terrorist attack.

** I love obscurial fics, have you released it yet? Drop the link if you have :D

If someone saw spell lights and called it in then it would probably be the country sheriffs problem, the town sounds too small for a police department. The dispatcher would probably send a cop car to check but it might take a while because raves are relatively low priority compared to violent cases. If there was destruction (e.g. if it looked like a bomb had gone off) then the FBI would get involved.

*** I agree, depending on how much of a ruckus the battle is making it's likely that whoever is in charge of law enforcement in small town Louisiana will most likely assume its a bunch of kids shooting off fireworks and send a sheriff's deputy or two to find out. A patrol car from the Louisiana State Police will respond if the situation is near a highway. If the situation escalates to the point that spells are fired at the police then it'll be a problem. Due to the remote nature of the area it could take many minutes for a large amount of police to show up. I imagine that twenty minutes or so would pass even before the first squad car showed up, you'd have plenty of time to finish a wizard battle by then and even if now a few Notice-Me-Not charms or perhaps an Anti-Muggle Jinx will keep the police from getting too close.

** In terms of local forces you have city cops who stick to their city, county sheriffs departments who cover a whole county including the cities within them, state troopers/various state agencies, and then the nationwide agencies such as the FBI who are mostly detectives though they have tactical teams.

In massive destruction events the State Governor might call in the National Guard, which is a state-controlled Militia branch of the US Army.

  near the border of Louisiana and Mississippi.

I'd say that it would either be a joint operation between the two states police departments or, and this is just as a precautionary action, the FBI
