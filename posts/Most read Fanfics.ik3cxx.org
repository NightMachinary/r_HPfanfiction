That's a spurious correlation, if I ever heard about one. Most most popular stories are pure trash IMNHO.

**** Sorting by favorites, the fourth most popular fic on FFN is Harry Crow (I won't comment on the first three, because Methods of Rationality is a lot more complicated to analyze and I haven't read the other two). You can probably find hundreds of posts on here tearing it apart in detail, but in short: the plot is almost pure wish fulfillment and bashing, most of the main characters don't get any real development, and the prose is far from perfect (admittedly better than most fanfiction, but that's just Sturgeon's Law at work).

And there's plenty of other popular fics like that on the site. They can be enjoyable to read, but they definitely aren't well-written by professional standards. I expect most of them wouldn't be nearly as successful if they were written as original fiction with the same basic plot and writing style.

***** To slightly play devil's advocate here because I'm a grade-a twat - Harry Crow is wish fulfilment with a heavy amount of bashing, yes. But there's a demand for that - as evidenced by the fact that it's the fourth most favourited fanfic on FFN. In fact, I'd argue Harry Crow's biggest problem isn't the premise (it's fan fiction, I can deal with an out-there concept) or the way it's told (perhaps it's just me but bashing and wish-fulfilment is my guilty pleasure), no it's the length. Over 700k words. Seriously, that's a slog. If it was exceptional, it'd be fine. But it isn't. It's a decent read for the first 40 chapters or so, but if you've read one story by him you've read them all basically and he's written much more concise distillations of his formula that for me hold up better. Very simply, he always goes for the “Harry breaks free, doesn't give a fuck, ruins everyone's evil plans, destroys Manipulative!Dumbledore, and ultimately gets Hermione” plot. And that works great for a 100-200k story as he's not a bad writer. But, as I said, Harry Crow drags it's feet. For me more than anything else, that's what makes it unreadable.

** On AO3, you could search by hits (ie: "most read") or kudos (ie: "most likes"). Of course neither is perfect, but either should give you something good.
