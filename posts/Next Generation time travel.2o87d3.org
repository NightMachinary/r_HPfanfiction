I just finished [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10164884/1/It-s-All-His-Fault][Its All His Fault]] where Harry's kids accidentally themselves into #12 the Summer before Fifth Year. Are there any other stories in this vein worth checking out?


** [[http://www.siye.co.uk/categories.php?catid=39][Here are links to thirty-four such stories]], all written for a SIYE contest with the following prompt:

#+begin_quote
  It was the middle of August before the Trio's fifth year at Hogwarts. As is the typical Sunday dinner at the Weasleys, all the family was there, including Harry and Hermione. The entire group was laughing very loudly as Gred & Forge explained an experiment gone wrong. It was the louder pop of an Apparition from the living room that silenced everybody. They all listened for a hint of who might have arrived, as they were not expecting any visitors. The only thing they could faintly make out were...children arguing. Very young children.

  Everybody at the table who had a wand brought them out as Mr. Weasley, Charlie, Bill, and Harry carefully went to investigate. Fred & George slipped out the back door to circle around the house. It was Arthur that was seen first.

  “Grandpa! James did it. I was just watching to see what would happen.”

  “Well, Lily told me to. I didn't think it was working.”

  When Molly heard a child call her husband “Grandpa,” she forgot all about her safety and bolted passed (sic) all the men, and entered the living room. She saw the two kids and promptly fainted. By now everybody was in the living room staring at them. Molly was almost forgotten.

  They both looked the same age, about six or seven. An adorable little boy, already identified as James, with messy, black hair, and twinkling brown eyes. The girl, Lily he called her, was a beautiful girl, with long, red hair, and bright, green eyes.

  When the children saw Harry and Ginny come in, they ran to them. James went to Harry, calling him dad, like it wasn't his fault. And Lily ran to Ginny calling her mum, wanting her to believe her version. Arthur finally went to help Molly.

Given that it's SIYE, all the stories are Harry/Ginny and tend toward fluff, but you may find some tales worth reading here.

** I have one that sort of does this, although it might not look like it from the start?

Read it ages ago, can't recall quality, just that it existed.

*** Way to completely spoil the ending there =/

(not that you really had an option, given the query)

**** It probably still should have still gone into spoiler tags as much of the mystery of the first book is lost. (That said, one might argue that the title of Ella's second book in the series is comparably spoilerish.)

****** One way is:

#+begin_example
  [Spoiler](/s "write spoiler-text inside quotes")
#+end_example

Which results in:

[[/s][Spoiler]]

(mouse-over to get spoiler text). I'm not sure if this is the sub's preferred formatting though. The mods might wish to comment.

**** I vote he's forgiven for his spoilery sin... but that may only be because I already knew about that courtesy of TV Tropes.

***** Sorry, I was coming off a 72 hour university essay bender when I suggested it, and as far as my mangled brain was able to understand, I was being perfectly mysterious... 10 hours of sleep later, and not so much.
