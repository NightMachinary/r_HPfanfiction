So I am looking for a fan fiction, that has a particular scene. It is where Lord Voldemort is Either weekend or injured I can't quite remember, and leaves a sacrifice. Sacrifice he gets, is ether Crabbe or Goyal. This later culminates in several death eaters betraying Voldemort.

Any idea what it was?


** That scene is from linkffn(to shape and change)

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.
