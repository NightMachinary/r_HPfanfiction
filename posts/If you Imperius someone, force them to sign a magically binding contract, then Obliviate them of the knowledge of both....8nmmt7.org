Just a thought I came up with last night; we know from Goblet of Fire that binding magical contracts don't need to be consensual (unless Harry wasn't bound and just didn't know it), and implicitly they're not easily counter-curse-able either.

So, what if you had a scenario where a Death Eater broke into someone's house, or just caught them somewhere without any witnesses, placed them under the Imperius, had them sign a binding magical contract pledging allegiance to Lord Voldemort and his movement, then Obliviated their victim and cleaned up after themselves so there'd be no clue anything happened?

Rinse and repeat a few hundred times, so that when Voldemort finally reveals himself, lots of people who would stand against him either spontaneously die, experience excruciating pain then die, lose their magic, get horribly sick, are compelled to obey the Dark Lord, or whatever else happens with magical contracts in your story.

Would this be possible? Or is there some aspect of canon/fanon I've overlooked that would prevent this from occurring?


** What's the point? If you've successfully got someone under the Imperius, you can already make them do whatever you want.

** Not exactly canon-compatible, but I had the notion that magical contracts require consent at some level. If so, then a person commanded under Imperius to sign a contract would be binding the person who cast the Imperius into the bargain, since they're currently taking responsibility for the Imperiused person's actions.

There are probably ways to game this to an advantage, but the rules are approaching a Fizzbin level of arbitrariness. ['...except on Tuesday']

*** As a counter-point to your notion, I have only 4 words: The Goblet of Fire. Though perhaps the idea of the goblet forming a contract is only fanon.

**** Well, we never really saw the goblet punish anyone, so I think it does not disprove wordhammer's idea as according to it it would be Barty who got punished if Harry decided not to compete and what we got from the series proper is inconclusive because compete he did.

** Well, there are one or two aspect syou /have/ overlooked:

- We don't know that binding magical contracts are as dire as fanfiction makes them out to be. The worst a magical contract did on-screen was produce some embarrassing pimples. We don't /know/ what the Goblet of Fire contract would have done.

- We can't even be sure there /was/ a binding magical contract with the Goblet of Fire, which is our only point of data for non-consensual magical contracts. The one who /claimed/ that the Goblet of Fire constituted a binding magical contract was Ludo Bagman. I repeat. /Ludo Bagman/. In the general mess of the situation no one questions him, but it becomes clearer and clearer through the year that Bagman is an imbecile and a fraud, so... y'know.

****** It's completely possible that these contracts have legal ramifications, particularly because this was a government sponsored(?) event.

On a side note, it's also possible that since the GoF was tricked into making Harry a champion, his particular contractual binding might have been null. Since he did actually compete, then we'll never really know.

** In addition to what [[/u/Achille-Talon]] said, remember that the binding contract in GoF required a "powerful magical artifact" in the Goblet of Fire. Short of that, we know of no magical contract besides Hermione's jinxed paper in OoTP, which is very unlikely to meet the requirement needed to establish a powerful contract.

*** Yes, but the Goblet of Fire had to be created somehow, right? So what would stop Voldemort from creating his own high-powered magical artifact for magically-binding-contract-making purposes?

That could be a plot point, really; with all of these people unwillingly enslaved by binding contracts, it might fall upon some of the few free remaining people to find and destroy the enchanted coffer where Voldemort keeps all of his enthralled victim's signatures/blood samples/etc.

#+end_quote

The same thing that stopped Dumbledore from making a true replica of Gryffindor's sword: not even the greatest wizards can replicate any powerful artifact they desire. Lots of examples of this: the Hallows, Gryffindor's sword, the other Founder artifacts, the Philosopher's Stone, etc. If it were that simple, any above average wizard would do it.

Besides, even the Goblet had limits. It didn't enslave Harry, much less force him to do something indefinitely. Contracts will always have limits and total, forced obedience appears to solely be the domain of the Imperius, and even then it can be fought off. And I suspect being Obliviated would end most contracts that attempted to be forced in that way.
