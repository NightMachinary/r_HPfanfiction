Ron often gets the short hand of the stick. Rather it's Hermione/Harry shippers or Hermione/Draco Shippers, or Hermione shipped with one of Ron's brothers instead of him... He's smart (example chess), and caring, he's stubborn and doesn't like to admit when he's wrong, but he's a good person.

Ron doesn't have to be the main character/centered on Ron, but as long as it has GREAT characterizations of Ron, in the story, that's fine.

Can be Het/Slash/Femslash

Can be them in Hogwarts or older.


** How about a Ron and Hermione centric fic where he is a secret agent for the Order to prepare the coup against Minister Malfoy?

AU where the Order had to go into french exile back in 1981 and Lucius Malfoy ruled Britain for decades.

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/][*/The Dark Lord Never Died/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5][/Starfox5/]]

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** I'm the guy always recommending the same Hinny Soul-Bond fic; [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/series.php?seriesid=54]] but Meaning of One's characterisation of Ron takes a flawed character and makes him one of the most loyal, courageous and loving people there. A couple quotes come to mind. After the shock of Harry and Ginny's relationship, after the initial and understandable shock period, he does his best to stand by them.

Ginny: “He either says the best possible thing, or the worst possible thing.”

Ron: “I'll side with [Harry and Ginny,] every bloody time.”

The fic does quite a few of things like that, addresses the flaws of the canon characters that makes them victims of bashing, but doesn't make them unlikeable. People make mistakes, motives are entirely understandable, and everyone's better with each other at the end.

Although a different fic; [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-is-a-dragon-and-thats-okay-hp-au-crack.731548/reader/]] does something unique and gives Ron a goal to achieve that none of his brothers have done, and that he shows a lot of interest in.

That goal? Inventing magical space travel.

Saphroneth's characterisations in general are always top notch. And you might find what you're looking for more in his fic.

** linkao3(Envy by FlorestCastellum)

linkao3(I Have Seen Your Heart by FloreatCastellum)

^ Those are both missing moments fics from Ron's POV.

I am just getting back into HP fanfic recently and just read those. Always on the lookout for other good Ron fics myself.

Years ago at HPFF I liked the way TheDirigiblePlum wrote Ron and Ron/Hermione. Her stuff was intentionally whimsical and exaggerated, which I enjoyed, but I always thought she treated Ron fairly even when using him as a source for comedy (because he is actually a very funny character) and pitting him in squabbles with Hermione. One of hers that I really liked was Muggle Fairy Tales: As Improved by Ronald Weasley

** Ron is the MC in this currently updating epic story. I don't want to spoil anything, except to say that this story has really amazing highs and humor, and really horrific lows and terror. I laughed, I cried, I yelled at the characters for being stupid (during incredibly well written scenes), and I was constantly amazed. It's my new favorite fanfic.

#+begin_quote
  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.

** I'm a big fan of linkao3(A Game of Chess by Kirinin), because it's well-written and a very unique premise. I'm not sure if ever come across a non-crack time travel story where Ron was the sole protagonist. Very interesting look at how Ron might behave if he were the most mature member of the trio and how it changes their dynamics.

** I'm currently reading [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12805206/chapters/29228961][Harry Potter and the lack of lamb sauce]] . It's an AU where Gordon Ramsey is teaching potion is 6th year and Ron's character in this fic is honestly my favorite. His storyline is so interesting and there's dept in his character which I love!
