Here's the idea. I want to see a brutal Triwizard Tournament.

Lets say that voldemort died in harry's first year. But his horcuxes still exist, so second year still happens. they can still cause harm, but yeah voldemort is dead for good. Lily's Love and forcibly taken/ingested Unicorn blood does not end up well for the wizard who spilt his soul into pieces willingly and knowingly.

anyways lets say barty crouch is in it for revenge. Cause thats what everyone thought sirus wanted. Not to bring tom back but to avenge him.

Now that all thats out of the way, Here what I want.

Lets say that everything happens canon wise until after hagrid shows harry the dragons. Harry goes off and tells cedric about them while he's chatting with a bunch of students. Cedric tells harry off believing him to be full of it and just trying to make him nervous. The Other students see and hear the whole exchange. (Which will come into play later).. Harry is then chased off.

Anyways in comes the first task all the champions BUT cedric are aware and slightly prepared for the dragons. Cerdic gets 3rd pick and he's having a small panic attack when he's called in and shoved into the arena he freezes up and dies via dragon. realizing that harry is actually not someone who fibs about these things. That the rumors of harry and a basilisk might be true after all. coming to this thought far too late.

after that horrible event harry goes and succeeds. but no one is cheering. the students who saw harry warn cedric about the event come to the same realization that cedric had but they are also too late.

now all the judges and officials get together and try to decide whether or not to continue. but because they used the goblet they have no choice but to continue.

in comes second task. harry is warned by dobby, not crouch. because crouches goal is to see harry dead, not arrive at a portkey. he just wants it public.

now as for hogwarts; cedric's friends have not mentioned the dragon warning out of guilt and worry that harry blames them. and maybe ron is just being stubborn. maybe compounded by the worry for his friend. Being the sort that always had issues about apologizing. (No bashing, just how most teen guys are. Hell i know i hated admitting being wrong as a teen).

so when the second task comes around he is at the lake about to rescue ron. perhaps here comes harry past with the dursleys into play. the dursleys were not a nice family. and they sure as hell abused harry. maybe they did not beat him or break his bones , but abuse takes many forms. And in this way neglect is what will kill harry here. The dursley's never bothered getting harry swimming lessons unlike Dudley (a waste of money perhaps). So when the gilly weed runs out, harry dies from drowning. perhaps his glasses came off underwater thus getting caught in seaweed.

once again tragedy strikes. ron ends up with survivors guilt. (knowing it's too late to apologize to harry while coming to the understanding that he was what harry would miss most of all.)

once again officials would come under fire. (under all this crouch would kill the real moody and slip away. escaping before anyone caught him. only leaving clues behind that would show investigater what went happened.)

and in the third task, the remaining champions would be so shook up that they die to avoidable things. fleur would die to the blast ended squererts(?Spelling?) being a hybrid species thought up by hagrid, there weaknesses would not be well known. and krum would lose to a sphinx because perhaps his english is not up to snuff. therefore failing an easy riddle.

â€‹

all this would set up the beginning of the story, from here on out I want to see what the consequences would be.

What backlash would Hogwarts face from angry parents and foreign nations. what the hell is wrong with teachers in hogwarts that using unforgivables on students does not raise red flags. the board of governors would launch multiple investigations. I can see snape ending up in prison when it's know that Neville's boggart is snape. not to mention his outright mocking of an orphans parents. The boy-who-lived parents. (this is before the whole Voldemort is back thing in cannon). And dumbledore has no reason to protect him any further because voldemort is gone. besides albus is busy with his own misery and guilt. Along with investigations of his own.

the ministry would be under fire for failing to take safety precautions resulting in the death of 4 children. not to mention how did 2 people break out of azkaban in less than 3 years. crouch jr was never caught so no one is aware that, crouch sr kept him out of it. How did no one catch crouch while he was hiding under a potion 2nd years can produce?

What cahrges would hagrid face for the blast ended squererts(?Spelling?) killing a foreign child? with the prejudice he faces normally and his past. (I recently read a story where he was not expelled for myrtles death but rather the raising of an illegally own magical creature{if interested i'll post a link}).

now what will sirius do in this situation? we have seen him go after revenge when it was a bad idea twice. we know he's not well balanced at this point. and he dropped harry off with no regard when james and lily died. this could set him on a dark path where he starts to be a serial killer targeting families tied to the death eaters. he's a man with nothing left to lose. and a large collection of books on DARK magic. So theres that.

with all this chaos happening what kind of actions would lucius malfoy take. there is no dark lord around so no one is there to stop his own ambitions.

could we start to see more suppression of muggle borns and 'halfbreed' without Dumbledores political clout?

I imagine that harry was an important icon for those whose rights are trampled by purebloods. would his death at the hands of an escaped death eater make him a maryter? Could muggleborns start to rally against a ministry that 'clearly does not care' about students?

I want to see not a tragedy about 4 children dying but rather the hurricane started by the flapping of a butterflys wings.

Sorry about my grammar and spelling.


** Heck, even if they don't die, they should still have CANNON injuries- Charlie Weasley has scars and such from working with dragons Yet the burns that Cedric gets are magicked away???????

I myself would LOVE to see what happens if no one dies, but it's close. Like the spike the dragon stabs Harry with makes it so he can't use that arm, Cedric has burn scars, Fleur becomes hydrophobic to the point she breaks down near water and also overly obsessed with having her sister in her line of sight every moment of the day.... Krum is a hard one IMO, because other than being cursed by fake moody, he didn't really have any huge issues.... so maybe the Botched shark transformation causes his human body to have side effects?

It's a cool thought experiment to see what COULD have happened.

*** Krum was imperioused to hurt Fleur and that could traumatise him. Or casting an unforgiveable could taint his soul or something, if you want to make up magical lore like that. Regardless, if he wanted to cast it or not.

**** Krum was actually Imperioused to get Cedric. It's only in the movie that he gets Fleur.

In the book, Fleur just gets Stunned by "Moody."

*** Perhaps Dragon fire could be magic fire, therefore it would be like curse damage. not burns from a candle or matchbook fire. So yeah. These ideas are indeed what I want too see. I just think death is needed because I feel that the wizarding world is rather nonchalant about injuries. Even petrified students don't seem to cause much alarm. I know the ministry were worried. but only because it was on-going. Once it was over and dealt with, no one really cared.

** I mean [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12666080/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Potter-Grimoire][Harry Potter and The Potter Grimoire]] is like that. It changes the tasks, adds in a lot more depth of magic, dueling and brings in Family Magic.

Summary - AU 4th Year on. After Sirius sends Harry a book for his birthday, his world changes. When the TriWizard Tournament is opened at Hogwarts, he must make the choice of if he would continue as he was, or honor his roots. Will Harry show the world why the Potters were one of the most Respected families? Or will he buckle under the strain?

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

** I do so love those 'what if one person paid a little more attention and opened the pandora's box of Hogwarts health & safety/administration issues' fics.

I would also enjoy something like this as a 'crack treated seriously' type story. I could imagine it in like, a 10,000ish word one-shot.

*** We don't even have to talk about snape for that to happen. all it would need is for the wrong student to tell their parent/guardian about 2nd year. I can imagine susan bones telling her aunt about Just how many people got petrified that year. I find it hard that only hogwarts has access to mandrakes. Hell I find it hard that Snape is the only one who could brew up a antidote. Do they not keep some 'ripe' mandrakes preserved? I think that mandrakes would not be worth much if they had to wait a whole year before they could be harvested for magical cures.

The cure to your cancer will be ready in a year. Just wait for the mandrakes to be ready.

But I will be dead in 7 months?

Oh. Well..Um..60 points to gryffindor for being brave.
