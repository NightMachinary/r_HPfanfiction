:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Might be getting one or two fics confused here, but I'm looking for a fic where Harry is raised by a dark family/person (might be a vampire O.F.C. lol) and disguises himself and his abilities at Hogwarts. He attends these “gatherings” of dark families in Europe, and I'm fairly certain it's slash around this time but not sure if it's Draco or Tom. Sorry, know that's not a lot of info but that's all I can remember. Thank you in advance for any help!!
