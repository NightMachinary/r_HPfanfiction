I stumbled across some series with that pairing but I can't remember what it was called. It seemed quite interesting and had some interesting exploration of magic or something. Sorry this is vague but I can't remember what the series was about specifically. I think it featured the fourth year prominently, may have stated there. I decided not to read it originally because of the soul bond but now I'm more okay with it. If anyone has am idea of what it could be that'd be great


** The only good HP/HG soul bond fic I know is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8490518/1/Error-of-Soul][Error of Soul]]. I am not sure that's the one you're looking for, though.

*** As I said I don't remember much. But I know it started or featured prominently fourth year and I'd guess that it was a year per fic
