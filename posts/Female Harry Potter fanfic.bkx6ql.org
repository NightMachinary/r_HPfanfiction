** You might like to link and/or describe the reference story so that people know what tropes in particular you're looking for.

As a matter of practicality, you're more likely to get recommendations if the people you're asking don't have to do work to figure out what you're asking for.

** you might enjoy [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10727911/1][Black Sky]]... where Harry is female and raised by the old-(OC)-Blacks.

The HP-part of the story is complete and the crossover of /Katekyo Hitman Reborn!/ is done near the end of that story so even if you dont want that crossover you can simply drop it after the HP part ends.

**** Well, that's the point ... she has never been named in the books or in the films, and actually aside from the Ron's claim Scorpius is a pureblood (and who believes Ron to be perfectly accurate especially with regards to Malfoys?), there isn't even evidence she is a witch or that Daphne had a sister (which helps my reading of linkffn(3912184;4236594)). That's all Pottermore and the accursed Cursed Child (and the latter is certainly NOT a part of my canon). Came upon this while reading linkffn(Exile by bennybear), which I highly recommend for reading, BTW.

There's something a bit contradictory about the statement "the universal standard of truth is determined by each individual".

Subjective canon is an oxymoron, really. The whole idea of canon is that it is binding authority.

******** Yes. Welcome to the postmodern world of confused authority. Subjective canon is an oxymoron, or it means ‚Äúwhat I do consider canon‚Äù. If you don't accept JKR as a pope (and I know I am not alone in rejecting CC), then you are suddenly in the confusing world of wide freedom and you have to decide what's your authority.

Do you accept CC? Pottermore (whole or parts of it)? Films? HP: Hogwarts Mystery? HP video games? Lego Harry Potter? JKR interviews? Is there Penny Haywood in your world? You have to decide.
