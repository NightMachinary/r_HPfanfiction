#+begin_quote
  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

linkffn(The many Harry potters of little hangleton) is an amusing fic though. Many vingettes of many different versions of Harry arriving at the graveyard.

Like at all. There is not one paragraph in these first 6 chapters that does not reference some obscure thing or character that only Worm readers know about.

Gonna give it a few more chapters, but so far it has been a huge disappointment after re-reading parts 2 and 3 of the series. Hoping it gets better soon before I give up. Would help if the magic/independence/less emo angstyness would start soon.

  Bilba has been a slave her entire life. All she knows of the outside world is what she sees from time to time outside the gates of Moria and the stories her mother used to tell her. Stories of a place called the Shire where her mother once lived and a placed called Erebor where, as far as she knows, her father still lives. Stories of dragons a thousand times larger, and more intelligent, than the beasts the orcs rode and of a strange concept called freedom where one was allowed to live as they wished with no one to tell them what they could, or could not do.The stories meant little to Bilba. The only future she had was to live, and die, as a slave as countless number had before her. And then the orcs dragged an injured female firedrake through the gates, her rider screaming obscenities behind her as he fought to reach her side...and everything changed.

** linkffn(The Hidden Hero)\\
Absolutely amazing. I loved it. It's gen and Harry/Ginny happens only in final chapters.\\
Harry is a metamorphmagus. As a child, he runs away from Dursleys, disguises himself as an older boy so he can work, earn a bit of money to rent a bed and somehow live. One day he diguises himself as a child again so he can play with other kids and in that moment an owl from Hogwarts finds him. Only his letter is not meant for Harry Potter but for the name he created for his new life. And so Harry ventures into his new magical life as a "muggleborn".

It was very interesting. ^{and now I need a reread of it.}

  AU What if Harry knew he was a wizard and about the prophecy before he went to Hogwarts? What if he was kicked out of the Dursleys and decided to attend Hogwarts disguised as a muggleborn? Harry Ginny

** linkffn(Honor Thy Blood)

This is my all time favorite HP Fic. I've been reading them for about 4-5 years now, but none have ever came close to topping this. I honestly shed a few tears when I finished it, it's just that good.

*** I have vague memories of it, but it's on my own favorites list so I must have liked it a lot back when I read it. Maybe I'll pick it up again since it's been that long.
