:END:
Harry is sent in Snape's house to wait his audience (5th book). The house isn't in a good shape, there is a 2th floor where Harry isn't supposed to go (and he don't go, but Sirius, Remus and Arthur decided to explore because they're suspicious), Snape basically abandoned that floor but now he is forced to go up there because Harry is sleeping on his couch, so he had to sleep in the old room of his parents (there is no light, old bottles anywhere etc.). Snape is messed up here, not evil, but pretty depressed. He used the summer time to "relax" and Harry's presence is unsettling, even if they reach an understatement. Then Harry look in his pensive, they fight, Snape throw the pensive and hurt himself, Harry escape in the rain, Snape follow him, they made up and when they went back to home they find there Sirius, Arthur and Dumbledore who thought they were attacked or something. Dumbledore decide Harry can't stay there because Snape is too unstable, Snape protested he didn't hurt Harry and Dumbledore: "What about yourself?"

I'm searching for this fic but I don't remember the title.
