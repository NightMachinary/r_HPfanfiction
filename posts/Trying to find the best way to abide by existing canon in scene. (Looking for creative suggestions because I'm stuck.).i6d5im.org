** For a muggle to get into the ministry of magic without any help, in a canon-compliant or even a canon-themed, magic system is, in my mind, impossible. That's not even considering the difficulty of a muggle taking down a wizard. With how resilient wizards are (mundane venoms don't work and Harry survives a cracked skull and a fall out of the sky caused by a bludger to the face), the ways for a muggle to take down a wizard, even an unskilled and incautious brute, without attracting attention is impossible. Muggle drugs would not work, blunt force wouldn't work where a bludger didn't, knives won't be more effective than a car crash (PS), and guns make a lot of noise.

I think your best bet is for your muggle to meet a friendly wizard. Maybe your muggle hangs around the general area and approaches the friendliest wizard. Maybe he stalks a few until he finds the one the most friendly to muggles. It's even an opportunity to create another OC or toss in a cool existing character like Arthur Weasley.

Make sure that if they're caught, that the wizard/witch goes through the appropriate consequences for violating the statute of secrecy and supporting a kidnapping.

** What if a Ministry worker accidentally drops a token in passing while rushing to work, William notices it and manages to get in through the toilets after all?

** 2 possible directions to go would be to somehow ask for help from a friend or parent of your character to get in.

You could also have him borrow the wand of your OC and pretend/threaten magic. To go further with this he may know of the location of the phone booth from previous comments of his GF, and he would then have to stake out for long enough to discover how to active it. From there he could state an objective of "research" and some sort bureaucracy or distraction to get by the front desk.

** This is calling for a detailed stakeout. All three of your ideas have potential, if you can take some extra time to set it up and answer the questions you have already posed.

He knows magic is real. Maybe even has a clue from his now-missing girlfriend so he knows where to drive this stake (give him any reason at all for a stating point among the 3 ideas), and just stay put. Mention all the /potential weirdos/ (witches and witches) he spots and how each clue is getting him closer to getting inside... Give us a bit of foreshadow on the last minute shit-hits-the-fan action (you can totally go back and add this after hammering out some acutal writing), and 2 or 3 halfway reasonable ways for him to tag along with random a random ministry worker, and your muggle is fking /in/.

After all, that kinda worked for golden trio book 7 chap 26, not with the Ministry, but with /Gringotts/. The way they had to partially "wing it" getting in, and the not-so-rosy turnout for everyone involved. Honestly it's one of the most compelling scenes of book 7, IMHO, and it wouldn't hurt to study that chapter to get a very good feel for what it's like to jump into a magical institution with not much prep and limited resources, and /fake it/ til you, erm, get revealed by Thief's Downfall and have to save a fking dragon to /make it/ anyway..?

Anyway I don't know if that actually helps, but you asked for something that fits with canon-ish, and my usual go-to in that case is /study canon/, especially when it's a similar action or strategy sequence.

** Honestly, given the setup and power difference, having your protagonist succeed like that seems... to be pushing believably. The wizarding government certainly has shown itself to be susceptible to this, but it has also shown itself to be very good against those without preexisting knowledge.

The two ways I've seen this done in the past:

- Wizards are good against unprepared muggles, but untested against prepared muggles. Muggles somehow learn about Wizards and take time to prepare in secret. All of the wizarding prep doesn't stand up to active muggle counters.

  - This is the more common one, and regularly done with muggle centric fics. Usually done comparing institutions/groups, but certainly could be applied to a single protagonist.
  - The best example of this I can think of is "Justice, Justice you shall pursue".
  - For your thing, it would be William getting intimate details about the MoM through research no regular muggle will have access to. (Maybe taking his girlfriends wand and doing research in Diagon Alley?). Then, prepared, he can infiltrate the ministry which is not hardened against it. Why would the welcome witch question if someone is a wizard if no muggle would ever pretend to be one?
  - Usually you just play up Wizard Arrogance here

- Something lets muggles try and fail and continue to learn.

  - This is less common, the only one I can think of that has done this well is "Harry Potter and the Natural 20". They have the police catching on, investigating quite a bit, but then losing to wizards. However, because of computers they end up back on the trail.
  - I find this a lot more believable for this kind of setup, although I think it is hard to do well.
  - For your thing, it would be William trying and actually getting caught / memory erased. However, because of something unique to him (Maybe he kept his notes on his search at his Girlfriends flat and the spells to clean up after muggle incidents don't target wizarding houses) allows him to learn from his failures. Alternatively, it could have him probing a few times and being rebuffed, but then he happens to get in when some of the canon craziness is happening.
