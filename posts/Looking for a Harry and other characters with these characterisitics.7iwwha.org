Ok, i am looking for fics which prominently feature characters with some or all of the following characteristics. These are features of characters that zi have loved in other stories like corcular reasoning and Antithesis. (I would very much appreciate ot if someone could link those fics for me).

1) The character is, by the standards of ordinary people even within fiction, disturbed to a certain extent. More is better. Example: Adrian in Antithesis.

2) The character is not really labelled (by the author, being labelled by other characters is ok) as being dark, light, or heaven forbid, Gray. They simply are what they are.

3) the character is violent. Not in a; mwahhahaha, lets kill everyone nearby in every chapter. More like soft menace and palpable malice reinforced with violence at times.

4) the character is deeply flawed. In Antithesis, Adrian is confused, arguably misguided, has self esteem issues, etc. In circular reasoning, Harry has PTSD, he has to deal with his emerging lust for flesh, he wants things that he knows he cannot have, etc.

5) The character has power but is not overpowered or even obviously powerful at all times. Maybe their power is derivied from information, deals, etc. Raw magical power is fine so long as it is not all consuming and overwhelming. I.e. They do not step out of a time travel ritual and casually bitch slap voldemort and dumbledore into a nearby shallow grave before walking off into the sunset.

6) the character embodies many of humanity's darker, more distatasteful and perhaps less mentioned aspects.

Thanks in advance for any reccomendations and apologies for spelling mistakes, I am nit very good at typing on my tablet.


** Closest things I can think of are linkao3(The Anti-Heroine by cheshire_carroll) and linkffn(Princess of the Blacks by Silently Watches)

  Hermione Granger knows she's not a good person. Disillusioned with life at only twelve years old; she is cynical, manipulative, ruthless and, above all else, a survivor. For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.  Main Pairing: Harry Potter/Hermione Granger/Tom Riddle

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.

** Since OP asked and no one has done it yet:

linkffn(2680093; 12021325)

I'm assuming those are the correct stories.

  Torn from a desolate future, Harry awakens in his teenage body with a hefty debt on his soul. Entangled in his lies and unable to trust even his own fraying sanity, he struggles to stay ahead of his enemies. Desperation is the new anthem of violence.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.
