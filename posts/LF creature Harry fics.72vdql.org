Preferably complete or at least lengthy. Any pairing but I love Harry/Luna the most. Slash is also fine. It can be a magical inheritance style or just born part creature or bitten by a werewolf, not too picky. Even something like polyjuice gone wrong is okay.


** I can't link them at the moment but look up: Hell's Eyes, Outcasts alley, amd Circular reasoning.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Siren's Song by hermyd)

it's a bit older and it's Harry/Daphne but it's also pretty good and well written if nothing else.

** Not sure when it'll update, but linkffn(We, Harry Potter by wille179) has my vote as one of the best Creature-Harry stories.

linkffn(Outcast's Alley) is more serious and it is pretty good too, in a completely different style. On the other hand, he turns out to be a type of Being (a non-canon one), not a full-on "creature".

linkffn(Weres Harry?), despite the somewhat cringeworthy title, is the only good Werewolf!Harry I have encountered, and yeah, it's pretty good.

  Down in the Chamber of Secrets, as Harry was dying from the basilisk venom, something awoke within his blood, starting his transformation into something else. The destruction of the horcrux in his head kicked that process (and Harry's soul) in the nads. Now what are Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, and Harry to do as a literal five-headed dragon?

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.
