** Madam Pince was the librarian not the mediwitch. I think her first name was Irma.

The story with Poppy posted earlier was pretty good. I'm a huge fan of random old magic stuff. It would be interesting what Madam Pince could learn with all the library at here disposal.

** This story may not be your cup of tea if you're not into SSHG, but Madam Pince eventually becomes a major part of the storyline in a roundabout way.

  In canon, healers and mediwitches were seemingly spared from the predations of the Death Eaters during both Blood Wars. St. Mungo's would have been a very soft target, but it stood inviolate. One patient was attacked, but the hospital and it's staff were spared. The question is, why? What could have kept mad killers in check? As with a great many other things, Poppy knew.
