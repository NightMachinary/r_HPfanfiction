*** It's so good that I'm actually having trouble finding another adventure-themed next-gen story that is even remotely close to the level this trilogy has achieved

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.

** I usually don't like next-gen fics, but Hogwarts Houses Divided is probably my favourite HP fanfic of all times... it's just really good, with actual conflict and deepening of canon themes, and the eleven year old kids actually act like eleven year old kids. Mind you, it's Teddy Lupin and not Albus Potter, but that counts as next-gen in my eyes. linkffn(3979062)

Oooor... If you want Harry's kids at Hogwarts instead... well, I'm currently going through the [[http://www.jamespotterseries.com/][James Potter series by G. Norman Lippert.]] It's not on FFN; it has its own page where you can get the five novels as ebooks... or you can get them as audiobooks through the [[http://livingaudio.co.uk/the-james-potter-series-podcast/][James Potter Series podcast]]. It's the audiobooks I'm currently going through... I try to go for a ten thousand step walk every day, and it helps to have a podcast or audiobook to listen to while I'm out walking.

Mind you, it's not a patch on Hogwarts Houses Divided. Much too Americanized for my tastes, the worldbuilding is a little inconsistent, and I don't think G. Norman Lippert has the faintest idea how Hogwarts classes actually work... But I do think it's good... at least good enough that I'm interested in finding out how it ends.

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?
