Relatively new to HP fanfiction and just cut my teeth on Vox Corporis. Rather enjoyed the drawn out development of the romance between Harry and Hermione. Looking for other stories (doesn't have to be a romance story per se) that incorporate the same trope. Thanks!


** Arguably the /slowest/ burn.

** My all time favorite slow burn. Be not fooled by the snappy summary; the burn is hot and slow. (linkffn Self Slain Gods on Strange Altars)

** I forgot this one; a totally underrated gem due to it's rare pair; Hermione x Scabior (the Snatcher ring leader who keeps her scarf). Amazing.

  AU, from Order of the Phoenix onwards. Hermione only wanted to learn Healing; she discovers that Professor Snape is a human being after all, and his actions dramatically shape the course of the war as events unfold. Complete.
