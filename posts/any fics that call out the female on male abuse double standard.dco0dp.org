ive seen it in so many romance fics. the girl hits or slaps harry in a fit of anger and it's treated as completely fine and justified instead of the abuse it is. i just want to see a girl do that and immediately get called tf out on it. id prefer a oneshot but ill read a longer fic if the plots good.


** I know I read something a while back that flipped the usual fandom conception of the Malfoys, so that Lucius was in over his head and Narcissa was a psychopathic monster with a cheery public face and a hair trigger in private. I think it was a non-slash friendly Draco. Maybe someone else remembers it.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

***** Oof. I recently read an NCIS fic where the director of NCIS actually took Gibbs (the team leader) to task for repeated head slaps of his teammate, and also the woman on the team, because she kept telling the slapped guy that he deserved it. It was really refreshing. The fic itself wasn't that great, but it was nice to see people get called out on their shit.

** In canon, this double standard is quite obvious:

- Hermione magically assaulted Ron with conjured birds and physically beat him up with fists. No consequences at all, and JKR wrote in such a way that it was all Ron's fault anyway (in the second case, Hermione did have a somewhat valid reason).
- Ginny magically assaulted Zach Smith with Bat Bogey Hex and physically ran him over with a broomstick, just for some minor transgressions. In the first instance, she was rewarded with an invitation to the Slug Club. The second time, she was rewarded with her House's support and Harry's admiration.

With the original author taking such a stance toward female-on-male violence, it's no surprise that fanfics generally continue this pattern.

We're meant to pity Merope, hate Morfin and Marvolo, and feel bad about T.R. (Sr.). Merope gets more of a spotlight because she's one with agency.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18935341/chapters/44954569][Golden Bullets]] (still in progress) is a point-of-departure fic where the people around Ron actually take the "bird-assault" incident seriously. It also addresses other instances where Hermione's actions seriously harmed other people, such as the "sneak" incident.

I wasn't a great fan of the rather stream-of-consciousness writing style, but I'm pretty picky about that sort of thing and found it an interesting read nonetheless. linkao3(18935341)

*** I've got a well-known pro-Hermione bias, but I am liking this fic, in the way that actions have consequences and how these consequences propagate, and it doesn't go overboard with any given character.

One bit that I didn't like is that the author kind of just assumes that there were better ways of keeping DA secret available to Hermione than the jinx that she actually used, which is a very uncharitable reading of Hermione's character. (In particular, the birds were an impulsive action, whereas the jinx was premeditated, so her being excessively violent in the latter is a bigger stain on her character than in the former.)

“We have nothing---NOTHING---to say to one another.”

“I think we have plenty to say to one another,” Neville hissed, careful to keep his voice down to keep Harry and Graham, who kept their distance, from hearing.

“We don't! We're not friends, Longbottom. And you most certainly are not my boyfriend, so stop acting like it! Leave. Me. Alone!” She turned to leave, but Neville circled around stopping her.

“You meet me tonight to talk,” he whispered, practically shaking with rage.

“No way in hell,” Graces growled. “Draco offered you his friendship?” Neville took a step back as the blonde shoved him. “And you turned it down? You insulted him like that?” Another shove. “You insulted me like that?” Neville grunted as Graces pushed him again. “If you're not a friend of my brother, you sure as hell aren't a friend of mine.”

She went to shove him again, but Neville caught her wrists, holding them tightly above her elbows.

“Graces,” he started slowly, honing his own temper in. “We are a mess of dysfunction. A serious mess,” Neville repeated, meeting the blonde squarely in the eyes. “But one thing we do not do---one thing I will not tolerate---is you touching me in anger.”

Graces had a flash of defiance to her face before she yanked her arms away, defeated by his words. She stared at him for a long moment before trying to push past him. Neville held her back, his hand catching her arm, as he leaned in close to her ear.

“I'm a good man,” he whispered. “Slow to anger, quick to forgive. Maybe not the smartest, but hardworking. And maybe not the strongest, but courageous. And I love you, Graces. I love you.”

“I'm a good man,” Neville repeated. “And I'm sorry that's not enough for you. I'm sorry that the only way you can accept my love is if my arm bears the cost of my soul. I hope you will meet me tonight. That you will calm down and see what a mistake you're making and choose to talk to me rather than end something that has been so good.”

  Slapping someone is excusable if that someone decided to do something really stupid and immoral (for example, being unfaithful).

That sounds like a big blank check for a spouse to use physical violence anytime they dissaprove of anything. Who gets to decide what's stupid? Who gets to decide what's immoral? There are groups throughout history who have defined those words whatever way they wanted in order to justify abuse.
