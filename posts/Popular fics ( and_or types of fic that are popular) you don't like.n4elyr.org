** Any fics that try to 'science' magic out too much.\\
Magic is meant to be unpredictable, unique from person to person, instance to instance.

The best example I have is the Fidelius,

"Lets have 2 homes under the Fidelius, with 'A' as secret keeper of B's home and 'B' as secret keeper of A's home, and then make A and B take an oath to never leave their houses"\\
The name of the spell invokes the concept of fidelity. There's no faith if you engineer a situation with zero trust and betrayal is literally impossible.

** My immortal. Its popular to some degree but the writing and plot is just awful. It doesnt deserve to be called fanfiction at all in my opinion. I dont understand why people even read it

*** My Immortal is legendarily bad. People read it for the memes, not because they admire the writing in any way.
