I need this. You don't see it much. I don't care if the story is twisted so he really did betray the potters, or if he came up with the worst of the pranks, etc. Whatever there is.

I don't mind slash if there is some, but I can't stand harems or military fic.

P.S. You're gonna see me a lot here. I like to request weird fic. And also help people find them
