  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

** Can't recall the plot too much, but I really liked Harry The Hufflepuff, the whole series was really funny and lighthearted from what I remember, I think I might have to reread it because I remember finding it oddly endearing to read through.

linkffn(6466185)

Oh! Almost forgot, I read this a lo-oooong time ago, but "Dear Order" is a completed /very/ cracky fic that isn't what you'd think it'd be, bonus points for having some of my favourite characterisations, especially Luna, definitely something I fondly actually do remember, albeit in parts.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.
