It's at least popular fanon that magic (or possibly Magic) has some level of intelligence. What if it goes beyond that, and Magic has either a mind of its own or some sort of deity behind it?

#+begin_quote
  Magic isn't just some mindless force. Though it might not speak them directly or clearly, it has likes and dislikes, things it desires, and most importantly pride. Magic loves to see (if "see" is the correct term) the wonder of children experiencing magic for the first time. It enjoys those beings who dedicate their lives to unraveling its mysteries, and occasionally creates new ones to keep them busy. It treasures /being/ treasured, being valued and respected.

  What Magic does /not/ like is to be treated as no more than another tool. It cannot stand people taking magic as their due. It /despises/ being taken for granted.

  This, not mere inbreeding, is the true cause of the weakening magic and proliferation of Squibs among some wizarding families. If they view magic as merely a sign of their own superiority rather than the wondrous gift that it is, Magic will find worthier recipients of its gifts. Muggle-borns are often some of Magic's favorites, as they truly understand how precious their magic is, which is why magical gifts arise in nonmagical families.

  Just as disrespecting Magic can bring punishments, earning its favor can strengthen one's gifts: Albus Dumbledore devoted himself both to studying magic and to sharing his knowledge with others, and so was able to overcome his former friend who saw magic merely as a source of power. Tom Riddle delved its secrets, reveling in his magic, but destroyed many of Magic's favored and in time he too saw it as little more than a source of power and superiority, and so was cast down by a child that fully embraced its wonder.

TL;DR: Respecting and valuing magic strengthens your magic, but if you take it for granted it can be taken away.

** I like the idea that it's an unconscious mind. Have you ever, after a really long day, opened your door, walked into your home, taken off your shoes, and flopped down onto the couch without really thinking about it or really processing your actions? That's 'unconscious thinking', in a Peter Watts Blindsight ( [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindsight_(Watts_novel)]] ) kind of a way. Magic doesn't really think in an introspective sense, but it sort of does a thing quite like it.
