Super talented and skilled Harry finally confronts Dumbledore during his 5th year demanding an explanation on why he's been oblivated by Dumbledore. He gives all of the classic cliche reasons like how he's a pawn piece in a chessgame, that Dumbledore is stealing his money, or he's trying to set Harry up with Ginny.

It turns out that an older Harry timetraveled to the end of his first year. He immediately went to Dumbledore and told him how to prevent Voldemorts rise and where to find all of the horocruxes. After all of that was solved, Harry decided that he didn't want to be a 40 year old man in a young boy's body, so he asked Dumbledore to remove his alternate timeline memories in order to have a normal childhood. He's still skilled because he's learned it in his previous life but it's a case of muscle "magic", but other than that his Hogwarts years have been normal.


** Or Harry witnessed something so horrifying, so Lovecraftian that Dumbledore had to erase it from his mind, lest Harry be a gibbering, ominicidal wreck for the rest of his short life.

***** On the bright side, there's enough room in the human mind to store a lifetime of memories, even if they were photographic, so I had to adjust it a bit.

The main issues with that scenario would be more in terms of short-term memories, unless someone screws up the Obliviation, which is arguably possible for even someone on Dumbledore's level if it's done often enough.

Of course, there are also possible negative effects of repeated obliviations.

***** Yes and no.

That is where I got the idea from, however, there would have to be flaws in how his photographic memory worked for it to have this negative effect, which Index did not have. Presumably Harry's would be a magical trait, where Index's could have been biological.

** The way you started out this post I was so certain it'd be a crack prompt.

Like Harry saw Snape singing Beyonce or caught McGonagall undressed having a sordid affair with madam Hooch. And went directly to Dumbledore to be obliviated.
