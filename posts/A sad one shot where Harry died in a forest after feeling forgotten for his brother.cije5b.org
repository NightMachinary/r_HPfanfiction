:END:
So a long time ago I read this really sad one shot about Harry having a brother who was declared the boy who lived. And his parents forget about him and this goes on for years until on one of his birthdays he can't take it anymore and runs into the forest. It was freezing but he didn't care. He stays and died there, only being found until it was too late. Later the wizarding world finds out he was the real boy who lived. Can anyone tell me the name of this fanfiction if it sounds familiar?
