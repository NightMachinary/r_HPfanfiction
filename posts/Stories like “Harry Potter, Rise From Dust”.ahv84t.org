I really like the not boy-who-lived stories. However, I really hate the bashing of his parents. My preference is where they forget him and have realize what they've done is wrong. An example is the aforementioned story. Are there any more like this? Any recommendations are highly appreciated!


** I like harry potter rise from dust very much because of the original idea regarding harry power while at the same time making his brother the real boy who lived and also his very cute little sister. That being said the only other fanfic that is quite similar that i can think is feral by bloodreddemon

Pretty sure those strange figures in shadow have something to do with the lapse in memory. The last night that Harry is paid any attention by his parents is before the attack in 1981, and he notices some strange shadowy figures and is frightened by them. There's a gong that sounds when both Lily and James "remember" they have another son.

When I read it, it pretty much seemed that these otherwordly beings did something to him that day. Too bad Bluezz abandoned it.

** Harry Potter: Forgotten Brother, an older WBWL story that explains why no one paid attention to Harry and doesn't bash the Potters.
