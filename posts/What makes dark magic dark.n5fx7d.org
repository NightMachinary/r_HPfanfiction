In canon it seams dark magician is defined as spells that require negative emotions such as hate, envy, jealousy and sadism to drive their intent. However, often in fanfiction I see the use of "dark" magic being justified by the cause of casting them.

If you are being attacked in a life or death situation is it not justified to want the attacker dead and or maimed in self defense? Essepecially in the moment adrenaline?

Now a point can definitely be made that you can easily disable a threat without leathal action using magic e.g. stunnign or disarming. However, is it not the most effective way to neutralise a threat using a cure that cannot be blacked in self defense? Why risk it? If the action is justified surly the means are?

This leads on to arguments justifing the dark arts, " you can use a leveritsting charm to throw someone off a window," therefore "it is just as bad as the killing curse if you mean it."

In truth I believe the need to mean really mean a spell is enough for the general case of self defense. A normal person couldn't cast a leathal spell or a spell with leathal effect intentionally without being a psycopath, under duress, in a life or death situation or totally and utterly believe the cause to be righteous. So unless you have a mental disorder or are a fanatic, e.g. a complete and true believer of the death eater mantra, not Just a simple follower, you shouldn't be able to mean the spells you cast. With psycopaths making up only 1 percent of society and the magical community being extremely small this should result in almost no one being able to cast dark magic at all.

I believe a far more compelling explanation for dark magic would be that it allows you to cast spellswithout meaning them.

This explanation would allow cowards to kill. It gives power hungry individuals the ability to pull the trigger without having to truly believe. Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. If you use dark magic once why not use it again, and again and again? Dark magic wouldn't be inherently evil but it enables evil deeds. In this case knowledge of dark magic would enable evil and should therefore be illegal. In self defense light spells should allow you ample protection as you would truly intend and mean to protect yourself.

The unforgiveables can still be unforgivable, you just have to define that you have to enjoy and revel the result of a successful casting.

I believe this would make dark magic far my realistic. What do you guys think and what are your thoughts on justifing dark magic?

Except, we know for certain that it is the one thing which cannot be it:

  “Never used an Unforgivable Curse before, have you, boy?” [Bellatrix Lestrange] yelled. She had abandoned her baby voice now. “You need to mean them, Potter! You need to really want to cause pain --- to enjoy it --- righteous anger won't hurt me for long --- I'll show you how it is done, shall I? I'll give you a lesson ---”

(OotP, chapter 36)

My own take on the issue of the dark magic is [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/foundations-of-the-dark-magic.html][on my blog]].

** I think the Seventh Horcrux explanation is funny, though it isn't much good for a fic you want to have moral implications.

** Interesting idea. That would explain why Harry was able to cast Sectumsempra. The unforgivables don't fit, though. They could just be their own separate category.

In my fics, dark magic is magic that can't be reversed. If someone loses a limb to an ordinary cutting spell, they can grow it back, but if they lose it to dark magic, it's gone forever. This explains Moody's permanent injuries.

** Dark magic in canon seems to refer strictly to spells whose sole purpose is to harm/hurt/maim/kill its victim (curses) or offer you an advantage at the expense of someone else's wellbeing (e.g. Horcruxes). I suppose that hexes and jinxes might be to a certain extent dark magic as well but they mostly cause inconveniences or are used as pranking tools rather than for seriously harming people.

Other than dark magic there's nothing else specifically categorized as colored magic but I would assume that white magic would involve healing and protective spells, while /grey/ magic would be all those spells that people claim could be used to harm other people but their original purpose is different.

** Any magic that REQUIRES emotions to cast would be very unhealthy if you use it too much. Training yourself to feel a certain way on command (and getting a rewarding dopamine rush when you succeed) would take a toll on the mental health. Imagine the implications of people whose brains have a pavlovian connection of angry = success and also have a massive repertoire of highly destructive spells.

** I only adhere to Canon's definition of dark magic personally and I think it describes it with a few key points:

Damage causing magic that is permanent due to the magic itself being built to ensure no healing is possible. Like Sectumsempra.

Magic that is noticeably evil in the way it feels and affects the world. Like horcruxes or the defenses of the cave in HBP.

The Cruciatus and Imperius. They honestly don't seem to match any of the other categories or dark spells we have, they are much closer to the Confundus /charm/ or any of the weird and painful hexes students use throughout the series. But their sheer power and the requirements of the Cruciatus seem to be enough to categorize them as dark.

** For me, I think its spells fuelled by negative emotions and/or have no other purpose besides hurting other people

** We don't have a proper definition, but I have it as spells created to hurt, harm, kill, or control. In varying degrees, of course, to include jinxes and hexes.

** In my opininon dark magic is just magic that is illegal. Some spells like unforgivables are illegal and with good reason too while others like blood quills are not. Conversely some spells like obliviate should be illegal but arent because wizards are dependant on them.

** Based off Gilderoys lockhart( Regulas Black) in Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin explaination,there is not "dark" magic.after all i could just "wingardium leviosa" a person and drop them out of the window or "wingardium leviosa" a brick and smash it into a persons head and kill them
