I remember a scene where he went down to the Chamber and found a tapestry of sorts with updating lineage where he saw he was Salazar's heir through Lily. I think the tapestry also showed the magic and the ability to speak Parseltongue via symbols, a little wand for magical ability and a snake for Parseltongue ability. I think Petunia as on the tapestry too, she was a Parselmouth as well.

  Being in the middle of a dangerous war meant having to plan ahead for the worst case scenario, as both James and Lily Potter very well knew. And as such, they placed powerful safeguards to ensure their son Harry would grow up with proper guardians should anything happen to them. ...in their defence, neither of them would have ever expected what would happen to one Sirius Black after their deaths.
