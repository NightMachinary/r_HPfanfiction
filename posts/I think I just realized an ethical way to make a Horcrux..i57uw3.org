Instead of killing someone, you simply read a chapter of the fanfiction /My Immortal/. This will surely tear up your soul, and nobody else gets hurt except for you, you may die a little inside but you can consent to that.

For the unspeakable act, you just write a Harry Potter fanfiction without putting a disclaimer at the top.

*** Dark Lady Ebony merely smirked when the infiltrator stab her with one of those glowing sword. While their civilization is advanced enough to have magic user living openly in a spacefaring galactic republic, none of them seems to comprehend the concept of Horcrux. The Earthling wizards knows, but they were too old-fashioned to comprehend she didn't just made one, three, five, or seven Horcruxes.

She never flinched, not even when the ICW approved total annihilation of the Earth in the vain hope of destroying every Horcruxes left. The Muggles has sent their Breakthrough Starshot decades before, and none of the wizards hiding among the now interplanetary Muggle society even think it's possible for Ebony to put her soul there. "There are simply too many", they said, "She never even killed anyone before Muggles start moving to space". Ha! Fools. The very simple act of imperiusing a Muggle girl (since Ebony still can't touch a computer without damaging it) and having her post Ebony's self-insert fic enabe Ebony to split her sould and create one thousand Horcruxes, conveniently flying to the nearest star. And they say nothing good can comes out of studying about Muggles.

  My name is Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way but u can just call me Dark Lady Ebony (coz i'm goffik if u coudln't already tell) and I merely smirked (showing off my fangz) when the infiltrator stab me with one of those glowing sword. It was really pretty and I wanted one, except in black coz that's my favorite color coz it reflects the color of my heart an d soul. Willow (dis is u Raven!!1!) gave me a kiss on my neck and nibbled on it a bit and her fangz were sharp enough to pierce into my skin and let out black blood. Even tho their civilization is advanced enough to have magic user living openly in space, none of them seems to kno about Horcrux (or even MCR LOL). The Earthling wizards knows, but they were too old-fashioned to comprehend I had already shattered my soul into a million pieces after listening to Evanescence (AN: u really need to listen if you don't knwo already).

  /AN: was this good? Let me know FANGZ!!!/

*** Hey, be kind to authors who are doing their best. "My Immortal" may well have been intended as a parody, but HPMoR, whatever you may think about it, was a sincere effort to teach readers useful skills of self-reflection and making better choices, and the author sank quite a lot of time into doing it. If you really think that he botched it up, then write a better version, rather than low blows like this.

How would you feel about spending a year or more writing a story that you hoped would help people understand themselves better and maybe make the world a slightly better place, but then have reviewers saying that the result was so bad it's soul-crushing? Do as you would be done by.

**** By that same logic, no one should criticize art, literature or cinema that they dislike.

Putting your art out there where people can see it and possibly dislike and criticize it is the most terrifying and exhilarating aspect of being an artist. It doesn't matter how much time and effort you put into a piece of work, people are still going to dislike it. You're basically saying that everyone should get the same amount of credit for their content based on the hours they put into it, instead of judging it by its quality, kind of like the artists were just punching a clock.

...This is fanfiction. Rewriting the rules happens all the time, and doesn't normally warrant more than a shrug of the shoulders, especially if the author arguably had a good reason. In at least some cases, the author of HPMoR rewrote rules deliberately in order to keep them from being story-breakingly powerful, like the emphasis on transfiguration being temporary, or the six-hour hard cap and consistency requirement for time turners. People complain about HJPEV being a Gary Stu, but if Yudkowsky hadn't reined in the canonical rules, Harry could have done much more ridiculous things. IMO, for the story Yudkowsky set out to write, changing those rules was a sign of good authorship, not bad. Slamming him for it makes no sense.

Also, while there's not really an official definition of Mary Sue/Gary stu, I will die on this hill: an op character in and of itself does make that character a mary sue. HJPEV is a gary Stu not because he's OP which he isn't really, but because he's the only character in the entire story that has any agency aside from quirrelmort.

************ No she didn't. She reacted. She reacted to the fact that her every thought in MOR is utterly dominated by what she thinks of HPJEV. The entirety of her character in this story boils down to her comparing herself to him. She is never her own person, ever, not once in the entire 100 and something chapters.

Compare this to SPEW. canon Hermione is far less concerned with Harry's views on house elf welfare, except in that she'll think less of him if he doesn't agree. Which is its own problem, but it's one that flows naturally from her character and isn't just her trying to be more like HPJEV.

To creating a problem that doesn't exist in canon. Partial transfiguration is probably the example most relevant to our current conversation. Transfiguring part of an object is totally doable in canon. In fact it's usually the result of not doing the transfiguration properly.

************** It followed narratively from her realizing that Harry wasn't even trying his best when he beat her at the army game thingy. She then took down some "bully boys," (by the way it sounded really dumb to call them that) there was a discussion between her and Dumbledore about her not wanting to just be Harry's sidekick. Then she started sphew. There was more discussion of heroes, Hermione didn't consider Alice longbottom or Lily Potter heroes and attention was called to that but it wasn't really addressed.

Ultimately, the whole thing was about her wanting to be a hero because she didn't want to just be a sidekick.

Also, this is another criticism I'd make, it's never really fully explained exactly what yudkowski means by 'hero.' are firefighters heroes? What about janitors or milkmen :p? soldiers? Surgeons?

Also, he could have done a lot more with free transfiguration regardless. There was concern about transfiguring things that are lethal into gas, but if that's a concern why not use something already edible, or at least benign.

Plus we're clearly not too worried about breaking the story when we gave Harry his invisibility cloak early along with a time machine, which was also not used as well as it could have been.

*************** Over and over again you criticise with things that from a different point of view are strengths. Exploring what it means to be a hero is one of the ways it's thought-provoking. Based on the other criticisms that get made, if the author had tried to give a definitive answer, he'd have been attacked for pushing his own view. At least he got you thinking about it.

You mean like the ice block that Harry created from scratch to turn intoa rocket-propelled broomstick? And as for not using it enough, given how he beat Voldemort and killed all the Death Eaters just by transfiguring the tip of his wand, and bought himself time to do so by threatening to transfigure antimatter, and given how he was shown what experienced wizards consider to be appropriate precautions for novel transfigurations, I find this a bizarre accusation.

Time machine not used as well as it could have been? The time machine that Harry wants to marry? That he tries to use for /everything/, to the point where it's almost confiscated for misuse and he gets a warning from the universe itself not to meddle? The one that still gets used in the Azkaban arc when it was supposed to be restricted, and gets used in the climax even though allowing Harry access to it any earlier would have made things too easy? The time machine that JKR herself realised was too much of an "I Win" button, leading her to destroy them all in book 5, and yet Yudkowsky managed to repeatedly and plausibly weave it into his story? How is that a /failing/?

If he persuaded some readers to take /any/ version of Bayesian probability seriously, or at least motivated them to learn enough about Bayesian probability to even /consider/ taking it seriously, I'd say he's done the world a service. Most people don't get as far as thinking about how statistics and probability affect their lives, and then they go out and buy lottery tickets and insurance, and they travel in cars and trains and aeroplanes, and they might or might not get cancer checks and blood pressure tests, and they don't ever do the maths and work out what's in their best interests, which things are worth doing, which things are really safer than others. Most people wouldn't even know how. Giving them a nudge toward thinking about it and just maybe learning about it, that's a positive thing. Why get angry at him for it?
