I'd like to see a story where Time Turners, or even just time travel in general, is used a lot, and exploited to their full potential.

I've already read linkffn(Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon), so something other than that, please.


** linkffn(7062230)

This one has some really great time travel action.

  Trapped within the depths of the Department of Mysteries, Harry is entangled in a desperate, violent battle against both the Death Eaters and a horrifying creation of the Unspeakables, with time itself left as his only weapon.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

** Ok, I'm not linking the following on the basis of quality so much as on the basis of originality. This is one of the first HP fics I ever read and was, I believe, either the progenitor, or among the earliest users, of a great number of plot devices that have become cliches just by the sheer number of people copying them.

Examples include, but are not limited to: Time traveler training, trunk living space, Fidelius abuse, "super" patronus, "super" wand, Harry trains over the summer, Independent!Harry, Super-ish!Harry, (mild) Ron bashing, random and sudden infatuation with Ginny, and many more that not having read it in nearly a decade has caused me to forget.

Again, not the greatest quality fic, (though I certainly recall it being readable back when I read it) but if you really enjoy time travel abuse, or even if you just want to see one of the anchor points that influenced much of the current fandom, it's definitely one I would recommend skimming through.

  Now AU, 6th Year, following OoTP. Tired of the way Dumbledore and the Order treat him, and ready to face his destiny, Harry dedicates long hours to muggle and magical training to take the fight to Voldemort for a change. Slight HPGW, not shippy though.

** This isn't HP related, but Robert A. Heinlein, one of the more famous SF authors, wrote a short story (All You Zombies) involving time travel that's pretty damn good:

[[http://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/wp-content/uploads/Robert-A.-Heinlein-All-You-Zombies.pdf]]

Other than that, overexploitation of Time Turners is pretty screwy because without clear limits you get weird recursive stuff and even with them you get messy plotlines, so it's pretty hard to pull off in that sense and still have a whole hero vs. villain thing going on. (The above short story, e.g., is not a hero vs. villain sort of story.)

** linkffn(11053807) This is quite a good story. It uses a "specialised" time turner that can go back months/years, but it's used really well. From memory it gets a bit too smutty for my liking at the end, but yeah really well written, and I generally don't like HG/SS.

  In her sixth year, Dumbledore makes Hermione a key figure in a plan to help Harry defeat Voldemort. (It's difficult to summarize this without spoilers--- HG/SS; there's a Time Turner involved but probably not how you expect; the story really gets started in Chapter Three.)
