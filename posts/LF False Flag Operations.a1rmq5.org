Are there any fanfics where anyone runs [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag][false flag operations]] (pretending to be someone else to shift responsibility, make someone else look bad, etc.)? No one believes Voldemort is back? Sirius and Remus dress up as Death Eaters and attack the Daily Prophet or something.

The only instance I can think of is in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]] where one of Hermione's muggleborn resistance dresses as a Death Eater to attack Hoggsmeade (I think).

  PART I: Days before his 6th year, Harry Potter is sucked into another universe by forces not of this world. Dazed and confused, Harry finds himself in a world where his parents are alive, where Voldemort has never fallen and he is Voldemort's key enforcer

** In "Divided and Entwined", there are more false flag operations than that rogue mission. Voldemort uses a muggle bomb to kill Shacklebolt and his Auror team (all supporters of Dumbledore) and blames the muggleborns for it. The Aurors start a fake muggleborn resistance group to trap the real one. And Dumbledore uses Snape to stage a fake attack on one of his own supporters to discredit the Death Eaters.

** DogheadThirteen/Cal's excellent "The Scourge from the North" has this in more recent chapters. Sadly, it's currently only posted in the CaerAzkaban Yahoo group. They're pretty free with accepting new people though.

** Linkffn(A Cadmean Victory) has this. Be warned, Harry is just as edgy as people joke about.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
