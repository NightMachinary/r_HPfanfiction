I've been reading Initiate, the sequel to Innocent by MarauderLover7 and its different enough but has so many similarities to cannon that I keep mixing stuff up in my head.

What's one thing from a fic that keeps sticking in your head as cannon, no matter how wrong it is?

**** They aren't canon- the spell was first mentioned about 12 years ago in a Snarry fic where Snape was hiding his pregnancy.

There are muggle-repelling charms, disillusionment charms and the confundus charm, spells to make a place unPlottable and to obscure what's really there with a vision of a run-down ruin surrounded by danger signs... but there is no Notice-me-not.

Nor is the incantation animadverto-mihi-non.

** This is a common thing in fanon, which has molded how I view the house of Black (and other old pure blood families). There's nothing at all in canon that says they're practically royalty. Nothing! Just because it's the 'noble and ancient' doesn't make it /noble or aristocratic elite/. Arranged marriages and betrothals while in school and rituals and rank and honor codes... It makes for a good story but, really.

While it's certainly something I choose to believe because it's fun, it's just not true until told otherwise.

*** Yes! There are so many protective spells in canon, but I can't recall "wards" being used in the books. I mean, sure, they can be the same thing, but that's not how it's used in fics. It's like, 'he warded the room as he left' but /what/ did he actually do to it? Anti intruder jinx? Locking? Door sealing? Imperturbable charm? Spit daisies at people if they look at it funny?

But it gets so mixed up with canon in my head that I catch myself wondering why, say Snape didn't have his potions stores warded, and I realize there's a problem and it's time for a canon reread.

**** Hermione waves a wand around while muttering various spells in canon to protect their camps. They were said to be protective spells, including the anti-muggle ones and something to prevent them from being found with magic. Closest* thing, really.

The movies are mostly to blame for Wards, in my opinion, or at least their popularity. There are added scenes in the movies while they are camping featuring the protective "field" of the spells, and then there's the "forcefield" effect for Hogwarts to reinforce the idea. I haven't watched all of the various movies, so there might be other spots. But those are the ones I've seen pointed out before.

Things like that happened a lot for a while. It was a big thing, trying to write even regular fanfic. Little cults developed around avoiding her lawyers' wrath. That's why fanfic still has those stupid warnings even today. It's an artifact of the times when entire sites were being taken down for hosting it, though few of them talked publicly about it.

Many site that remain from that time are much more stringent than fanfiction.net is today, having solid and detailed requirements for disclaimers and editors scanning through stuff by hand before it can be published.

Some of that was also from other fandoms, like the notoriously bad McCaffrey. Still can't put fanfic of her stuff and many others up on fanfiction.net, if I remember correctly.

****** Thank you for the link and comments. I'd known about her stance on adult-themed fanfiction but don't recall instances of her going after regular fanfiction. In fact, the site you link has this quote:

#+begin_quote
  For the avoidance of doubt, our clients make no complaint about innocent fan fiction written by genuine Harry Potter fans.
#+end_quote

which seems to amplify this point. Apparently she and her lawyers came to this decision earlier on (and earlier than my involvement in the fandom)? Fanfiction.net has several HP stories dating back to 2001 (by Cygnus Crux and others) so there seems to have been some mild tolerance going back that far.

It's notable that Anne McCaffrey reversed her stance on fanfiction in the twilight days of her life and the Bobmins did a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7591040/1/The-Queen-who-fell-to-Earth][HP/Pern crossover]] not long afterward. Orson Scott Card, long a hater, also reversed his stance (though this is partly because he was being a hypocritical dickhead, having written and sold fanfiction himself, and partly because he thought he could make a billion-dollar franchise out of /Ender's Game/ with the release of the feature film). Even G. R. R. Martin, who for years set the standard for fanfiction hatred, has pretty much given up the fight--though he still shits on fanfiction writers whenever possible.

Anne Rice still hates it and fights it, but nobody reads her stuff anymore. (And there seem to be plenty of other options (/Twilight/) for those who wish to write gay vampire sex.)

** Discrimination against Muggleborn, especially witches.

It is exceedingly common in fanfic but there is no canon evidence for it. Beyond Malfoy being a racist little shit-head and no-one calling him on it, there is no indication that outside of the actual war year (7th) Muggleborn were discriminated against. And as for misogyny, we have Amelia Bones, Fudge's predecessor Bagnold, and several other counter examples.

Yet I have this stuck in my own head canon as well.

*** Well we do have the bit of canon from the previous generation's fifth year. Calling Lily a mudblood was a bad enough final straw to end her friendship with Snape. That was before (as far as I recall) the first war being in full swing.

It's also mentioned in Pottermore (I think in CoS regarding purebloods) that there have been studies done my the Ministry to try and verify claims that by blood purebloods are better than those who aren't. While they were inconclusive, it's stated that purebloods use this as evidence that they are in fact better. It's that ideology that leads to subtle things, like choosing someone else over you for a promotion. But we don't see it in canon because it's a school setting, we only really see what children and a few select racist assholes do (thus no evidence of this).

But yeah, it is true that fanfics tend to take it to another level, like you're someone special for /not/ discriminating.

**** True, there is some anti-Muggleborn racism in the wizarding world but it's more similar to the kind of racism against black people you find in certain parts of the USA today, than to full on Apartheid South Africa style as it is portrayed in many fanfics. Draco Malfoy is analogous to a white supremacist kid from a KKK family, and Hermione is the equivalent of a black.

Canon case at Hogwarts at least. I believe it's mentioned in canon that Durmstrang does not take in Muggleborn students at all.

** Basically the one-dimensionality of some characters dissolved in fanfiction. I can't read about Dumbledore anymore without thinking of him as politician/manipulator. Also Molly Weasley lost her "mother-bear" feeling to me and began to feel like a matriarch. And Ginny Weasley strikes me as obsessive and also a bit of a stalker. To be honest, I read enough fanfiction to think that the epilouge of canon is utter bullshit, seeing how much better some ff-authors followed the red line of character through the years and ended up with completely different pairings. Ron/Hermione makes no sense to me and Harry/Ginny is really unsatisfactory.
