:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember reading this fic anywhere from 2016 to 2018, I've been looking it up recently, but I can't find it.

If I remember correctly the fic starts in the summer right after 4th year on Harry's birthday, and I can't remember if he gets the letter before or after, but he goes through some sort of creature inheritance where he feels a burning on his back.

The creature inheritance gives him wings.

The letter says that if he accepts someone from the school will cone to help him choose his classes and get his school supplies, one of the things Harry chooses is something to do with blood magic.

There's about 20, more or less, classes he can take in his first year there.

The school is not anywhere in Britain or Ireland, It's either in South America, Europe or Africa, it's also not one of the cannon schools from those continents.

They have an exam before they can get into the school, where a lot of people die.

There's a scene where Harry and some OCs are at the border of a treeline with really tall grass, there are some sort of creatures in there that are really dangerous.

There are these globes of magic that all the student have to touch to determine if the have the correct magic to go to a class that teaches whatever they want to learn.

Before or after Harry does that he meets someone with either the same creature inheritance or something really similar.

Harry's creature inheritance is really rare to the point people think their either extinct or a myth.

Parsle Magic is a thing as well, a class for it to.

If I remember anymore I'll edit it in.

forest-dream has given me the answer! Mysteria by Liria Nai, here is the link for anyone who wants to know: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4306899/1/Mysteria]]


** The other different magical school stories I know are linkffn(mysteria by Liria Nai) and linkffn(leaving it all behind by Amira Devant) and linkffn(niflheim academy by Araceil) , linkffn(arcane academy by ame3565) , linkffn(of learning and survival by Nyxied), linkffn(iskola preparatory academy by Rain Seaker) . Phew, I didn't know I actually knew so many stories! Anyway, you can look up stories yourself on ffnet by typing different schools in search engine, communities category, there are several wonderful compilations
