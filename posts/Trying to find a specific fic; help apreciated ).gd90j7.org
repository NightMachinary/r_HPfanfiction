:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a fic where Harry ends up injured and Dumbledore arranges for a law to be passed to prevent Harry from obtaining magical healing due to the injury being known to the muggles. I believe it was an eye-related injury? Needless to say this puts Harry into the Anti-Dumbledore camp. I can't currently remember much else. Thanks for your consideration. I believe the ones who injured him were Hermione's parents.
