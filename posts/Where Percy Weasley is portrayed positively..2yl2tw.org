I've been looking for a fic where people interact positively with Percy. It doesn't have to be a romance (in fact, I'd prefer it not to be) and he doesn't have to be a main character. I'm just looking for some appreciation for the guy.


** /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3784000][The Scarlet Pimpernel]]/ (50k words, complete): Percy is working under Umbridge's Ministry when he has a change of heart and decides to help the halfbloods and Mudbloods who are being rounded up for Azkaban. Inspired by [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scarlet_Pimpernel][the eponymous Muggle hero]], who transported French aristocrats to safety during the Reign of Terror, Percy teams up with none other than Oliver Wood (whom many people incorrectly [and hilariously] mistake to be his romantic partner) to save the day!

** Backwards With Purpose paints Percy in a very positive light due to a concerted effort by Harry, Ron and Ginny, although he's not a main character. He does play a major role however.

*** I really like this one, mainly because it's one of the few that really digs into the ugliness of the aftermath, often it's just "hey it's over, let's make babies and shit" (that happens too, as the baby boom can attest, but that's not all there is). A good read.

** Not a major character, but he has an interesting role in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]] by Starfox5. Really fun story, recently completed.

** I really like the light that Nightmares of Future Past paint him in. He starts out more hostile with Harry assuming he's bad news, but they reach a mutual agreement, and then a mutual trust. He's a very small part of it, though.

Loved this author's characterization of Percy. It's a really well-written WIP.
