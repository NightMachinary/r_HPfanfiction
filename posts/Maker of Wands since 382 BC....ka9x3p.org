Was reading a fic where this was pointed out as a date which couldn't be true. It made me wonder....what if in magical British BC meant "Before Camelot"?

Anything like this out there?

** Not sure why you think the 382 BC as a date isn't true considering that Persia was fighting the Spartans at Thermopylae around 480 BC

Edit: or after closer reading of your comment why the fic decided that the 382 BC date wasn't true.

Edit2: haven't read any fic with the years prior to Camelot being referred to as "BC". Only a few fics I have read had Harry being related to King Arthur (none of them had a "restored" camelot. So sorry can't help with your request.

*** Sorry if I wasn't clear. It was the opinion of a character in the fic that the date wasn't possible, not mine. It just made me wonder if that had been teased out anywhere else.
