I was scrolling through my favourite subfandom the other day, and I started wondering what it would be like if all these different versions of Harry, Hermione, Snape, etc. meet each other under some circumstances. I wonder if anybody's ever brought the characters from different fanfics into a single story as a collaboration between authors or as a roleplay?


** linkffn(2829366) is considered the classic of this I believe.

  COMPLETE. In the heat of the battle, he swore a blood oath to defeat Voldemort in every form. But when you factor in his understanding and abilities to travel to alternate dimensions, it presented the sort of problem only a Harry Potter could have.

** I think remember some omakes on linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20 By: Sir Poley) with linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality). But not an actual crossover fic. But I'm sure it's been done.

*** Yes, I remember that omake. Short but funny. Natural 20 is an excellent fanfic. A shame it's abandoned.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
