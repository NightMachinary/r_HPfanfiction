I saw something about Dumbledore and that Fawes was his horcuxe .He was connected to Harry and Voldemort because Fawes had the 2 feathers that were in the wands picked from her. Why else would Dumbledore blame himself for his sisters death!? I'd like to see what you guys say

** I'm not sure I understand how Dumbledore's remorse for Ariana's death would relate to him having a horcrux?

I am now far, far, far dumber for reading this.

** Aside from how this makes no sense at all, a Horcrux is piece of /soul/, attached inside a being wherever souls are and not to the entire physical body - especially things like feathers that normally moult anyway. eg. Having a hair from Harry won't connect you to Voldemort.
