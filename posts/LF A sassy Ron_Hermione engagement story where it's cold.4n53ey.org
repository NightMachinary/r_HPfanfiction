I read it a while ago and can't remember it. It's very cold and Ron comes in from getting coffee. They both kinda lay in bed and read, etc. and then he proposes. The dialogue is REALLY sassy and snappy... Can you guys help find it?

  An ordinary albeit particularly lazy sunday. Hermione is trying to read her papers and Ron cannot keep his gob shut. Fluffity flufffluff. Fluff. Rating for language.
