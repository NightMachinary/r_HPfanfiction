** Harry, but without all the love at first sight bs. I like their relationship as an bond that builds slowly over time with Harry taking proper notice of the one person who's always been there for him. That being said, I do like the odd AU so long as it doesn't try to convince me Hermione is some supermodel who just needs to do her hair.

*** I prefer a tomboyish Hermione ("Seriously, I value time for studying - dolling myself up every god damn day? Not worth it! I am here to learn, not to attend a fashion show!"), too! It fits her hands on (but also intellectual) personality much much more, then writing her as some doll or princess-type :( (a lot of writers make her room at her home pink - I seriously doubt Hermione is that type of girl!)

*** Yeah, I don't buy the common "Hermione, can we talk - I think I'm developing feelings for you" angle. Them just increasing their physical contact over time (longer hugs, sitting next to each other turns into cuddling/spooning) until they randomly start making out feels more organic, unlike the stories where they define a relationship which is not even there.

Seriously, Ron was just loud and insensitive! He tried shouting her into submission and she wouldn't have it!

There were only two instances where Hermione needed to be called out and sadly neither Ron, nor Harry, really did it right! In the one instance, SPEW, they gave in and took those damn badges to shut Hermione up and in the other, the Firebolt-Incident, Ron forced Harry not to talk to her - when instead Harry should have told her off ("If you don't trust me, then maybe you aren't my friend, Hermione! Going behind my back like that? Running to the teachers after all we've been through? That's low, really low! You didn't even try to talk to me before! You acted because you thought it was for my own good - just like all the adults in my life! Seriosly! How can I trust you if you snitch like that?")...but nobody can say that Ron knew how to do things, he wasn't all that great at social interaction after all!

** Tonks. There is a certain imbalance of power/experience, there is a certain "opposites attract" factor, but it is within the Realm of acceptable (5-6 years) and Tonks is not a fascist thug (unlike many of her popular shipping options).

I dig the "seduced by older woman" angle and I see Hermione, at least in books 5 and 6, looking for more maturity than her peers can offer.

Start the thing off at Grimmauld, a friendship where Tonks becomes Hermione's confidante throughout the Umbridge reign, throw in a few hospital visits after the DoM battle, a growing attraction and you've gotten yourself the base for a relationship.

** Harry!

Why?

Simple:

Both can learn so much from each other! She can give Harry the support (she already does, but it works better if they are romantically linked! Encouragement from your SO works better than from even best friends - and she is his best friend, as she's not a fair weather friend, like (Mo-)Ron!) and knowledge (he too often slacks off at school and needs Hermione's knowledge, hell having her as his GF? I bet he'd be more motivated to study and live up to his potential!) he needs! Hell, she might even be able to get him councelling (he needs that, he has too much baggage and he - deep down - considers his own life as being worth less than the lives of other people! Otherwise he wouldn't have walked to his death like he did! Seriously, they haven't tried to fight Voldemort conventionally, destroy his body and destroy the DEs and no one cares about the weak wraith! Hell, at best you can trap him somewhere and now have years, if not decades or centuries to collect the damn horcruxes!).

As for Harry? He can make her take breaks, get some self-confidence (about her looks for example - hell, she can do that for him, too because Harry kind of needs that too, to stand up to others and not go along with bad plans!), help her pursue her goals (more than (Mo-)Ron who would probably be happier with a woman more like his mother, so an unambitious housewife popping out more babies than the family can comfortably afford (they should have stopped after the twins IMHO)) etc.

Also: They share a common background and both hate the double standards in the wizzard-world! Hell, with them linked? I bet Malfoy and Co. wouldn't have gotten away with a slap on the wrist after the war! They both would be strong force for justice - in canon I think the Weasleys neuter this because they don't want wizard culture detroyed (just like Dumbledore they are afraid of rocking the boat too much and calling for radical reforms etc.))

**** I think Laxian's being pretty hyperbolic, here, but it isn't too unreasonable to think that Ron would prefer Hermione as a stay-at-home mum. I also don't think it's very fair to point to her (CC ew) profession as Minister as having anything to do with Ron's desires. He's a good sort, but he has consistently struggled a serious inferiority complex for what seems like his entire life. Even if you want to make the argument that he might get past it eventually, we don't see much in the books to hint that that would be the case. Sure, he's ready enough to compliment Hermione on her intellect, but to have her be the primary bread-winner while he works with his brother in a joke shop? Even if he did eventually get past his prior inferiority complex, a situation such as that would very likely reignite it.

****** Again, I have to disagree that the fact that Hermione is Minister is proof of anything as to Ron's character development. What's the alternative? That he wouldn't /allow/ her to be Minister? And all "we've seen" is the epilogue from the books which is very brief in terms of showing their characters and the travesty that is the Cursed Child, which has many characters acting contrary to their depictions in the books. The only other noteworthy source of information regarding their future relationship comes from Rowling and the actors who played the characters in the movies, and both have said that they believe that the pair wouldn't likely survive as a happy couple without outside interference of some kind, if at all.

** Dean Thomas all the way.

I was never really a big fan of any of the Golden Trio shipping with themselves mainly because in my experience, people who became really close as preteens never ended up in a lasting romantic relationship during or even post-adolescence unless they've spent so much time away from each other that they've changed dramatically since they last saw each other. They'd get so close that it'd be awkward to date, especially as teens.

The way I see it, Hermione and Dean both are muggleborns, so they can bond over the shared experience of being muggleborn as well as griping about the less-than-logical aspects of the wizarding world together. I can also imagine them having regular lengthy phone conversations as well as standard muggle dates over hols. I can see them getting together because he's far enough removed from the drama and trauma of being in the Golden Trio that he'd be like a breath of fresh air for her.
