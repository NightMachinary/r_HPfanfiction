HELP PLEASE

Please would somebody help me find a Hermione/Severus story that I read when I started reading fanfictions, it was one of my fav stories and I can't seem to find it.

Here is what I remember:

Hermione comes back to Hogwarts to teach -- Severus takes her out on a date and when they come back two trolls have been let loose in Hogwarts -- Hermione's door gets bashed in and she has to spend the night in Severus chambers which is when it gets steamy!

Severus stays with Hermione for Christmas and they stay with her mad family and one of Hermione's cousin does not like her at all.

And then I cant remember much from the middle but they move to Prince Manor (?) - SS has panthers are familiars they have a daughter and twins - SS becomes Headmaster of Hogwarts - and thats about it. No liking Ron in this story.

I would be so grateful!!!

Thank you!


** I used to read a lot of ss/hg but nope do not know. Boo
