:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I am looking for a story where Hermione and Harry want to change the Wizarding World. I remember the summary saying something about Harry wanting to build a space ship or go out into space. Can't remember if it's humor and/or crack. I think it had over 100k words. It is/was on ffnet. Any help finding it is appreciated.

*** No that isn't it. Thanks for trying though. I love that story but it's another one. Pretty sure Harry wanting to build a ship or go to space is mentioned in the story summary

** Linkao3(say a prayer by mad_fairy) - excellent completed series, starts cracky and a bit of bashing but then gets over it's self and settles into being a /really good/ story.

  During the summer between first and second year Harry does something that has unexpected consequences, for himself and for the wizarding world.

  Harry and Hermione are 'child prodigies'. Destiny managed to throw them together and they form a bond far stronger than any seen in the wizarding world. They use their intelligence to bring innovations into the world that have not been thought before.

  "You are gathered here today because the world is going to end within the next three years," Hermione said succinctly. "But my husband, having died before, is in no hurry to do so again. We are here to try and save wizard kind itself." A Harry Potter/Battlestar Galactica Crossover, with a touch of 2012 fused in for the fun of it. Obviously not Epilogue Compliant.
