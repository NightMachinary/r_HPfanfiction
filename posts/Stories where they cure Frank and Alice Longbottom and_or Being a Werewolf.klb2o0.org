Any stories that has that in them. It can be a main part in the story or a minor part.

Anyone can be the MC/Any site/Any Length/Old or New

Am okay with Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes etc. Doesn't have to focus on pairings

Would rather NOT have Weasley Bashing. No Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune/no Ginny giving Harry a love potion, etc.


** Pretty sure both happen in a harem fic I've read, but that shit went way off the rails. In fact I want to say it was a coven/harem story. Might be able to dig up the fic if you are interested.

Also I'm fairly certain the first of these two things was part of Harry Crow. If you don't mind Harry being a goblin. Wait... no Weasley bashing probably eliminates this one.

Out of the 100+ HPFFs I've read so far these aren't popular events. I only recall 3 or 4 Longbottom fixes and maybe 2 lycanthropy. Can't remember the fic for the other lycan one, other than>! they make Harry go to the ICW to try curing 13 or 14 of them, then they make a vaccine somehow?!<
