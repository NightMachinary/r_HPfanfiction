I feel like I haven't seen any harry/lavender fics, and I want to see what that relationship could be like. Preferably no bashing or smut, but both is alright if done in a tasteful way.

** I am writing one! Though admittedly, I've been distracted by my other fics, so it hasn't been updated in a while. But it's outlined and I definitely plan to finish it. It's about a prompt I found in this sub at some point üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

  When Lavender Brown's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire as the fourth champion, no one quite knows what to make of it. Except for Harry, who firmly believes that it should have been his name coming out of the Goblet and thus vows to help her get through the tournament alive...at all costs.

Not an orgy fic, not (strictly speaking) a smut fic. Just a little post war ptsd fic.

** It wasn't to my taste, so I never got past the first couple of chapters, and don't know if they actually have a relationship, but [[http://home.exetel.com.au/jaina/Unforgivable/Unforgivable.html][Unforgivable]] by Jaina starts with Lavender asking Harry to teach her how to break the Imperius.
