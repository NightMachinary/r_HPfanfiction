I was just in the mood for an unusual pairing. Lenght doesn't matter.


** Sincerely sorry for the incomplete inconvenience of Harry and Harley, I'll get back to it one day!

But, for my money, the story so far is pretty kickass.

** I think it was called Under My Skin, it was on [[https://fanfic.net][fanfic.net]] and it's pretty good if incomplete

  As he stared into the eyes of a grinning, insane, albeit very attractive jester, hoisting a comically intimidating mallet across her shoulders, he realized that he wasn't in the Department of Mysteries, or London, anymore. But he didn't care. Harry checks into the madhouse, and makes himself at home. Super!Harry/Hermione/Harem.
