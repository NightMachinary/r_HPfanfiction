Something other than the usual war, opression or bigotry. The example I'd point to would be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8724634/9/The-Snow-Queen][chapter 9 of the The Snow Queen]] which features one of the saddest dystopic magical worlds I've yet to see. In this case, apathy and laziness is the flaw. Some students died? Cover it up, wipe some memories and no one need ever address the problem. A world where those in authority are criminally lazy.

I'd be interested in anything similar where the magical world is flawed, for reasons other than bigotry, opression and war.


** I know you're looking for fanfiction, but I kind of want to recommend the Dresden Files to you. The "Magical law enforcement" of the series literally only exists to limit power. They make no tolerance policies look positively kind.

You might also want to take a peak at the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy][Firebird Trilogy]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1229909/Darth-Marrs][Darth Marrs]] which is a very different AU focused on society and politics in a wizarding world where the drastic majority of magic users are female. It's rather messed up. But a very good fic.
