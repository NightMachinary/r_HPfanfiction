I know, I'm disgusting.

Throw your best ones at me please! - I'd prefer fics in which Hermione is of age or older. No child!Hermione and Snape, ick. - No rape, anything else is fine.

I like dark fics, angst, action, mystery best. Thanks in advance. :)

** Not disgusting at all! It's my OTP and what got me into fanfiction in the first place!

[[https://web.archive.org/web/20151115140920/http://www.witchfics.org/abby/tosod.html][The Other Side of Darkness]] by Abby was the first one I read and what sold me on the pair. Still my favorite to this day. After a strange potion renders one of Harry's coworkers catatonic, Hermione must ask Snape for help identifying it...but he knows more than he is letting on.

And it's equally superb sequel called [[https://web.archive.org/web/30151115140856/http://www.witchfics.org/abby/survival.html][Survivals and Remembrances]] where Lucius seeks revenge on Snape by blackmailing him against Hermione.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2267793/1/Before-the-Dawn][Before the Dawn]] by snarkyroxy is a good one if you are looking for a less dark one. If I'm remembering it correctly, it's almost Canon compliant

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2290003/1/Pet-Project][Pet Project by Caeria]] is another nice slow-burning one.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1024910/1/Hinge-of-Fate][Hinge of Fate by Ramos]] is another favorite. Hermione's memory is missing something, including how she became pregnant. Snape would rather not remember.

I have to go but I have tons of others I can link you to! Are you a member of Ashwinder yet?

Edit: forgot to include author name for one. Typing so much (including manual web addresses) on my phone is a biiiitch

*** [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com][Ashwinder]] is a massive host site and database solely for SSHG fanfictions. Their standards for submission are very high (they will reject any chapter or story if there are any grammatical/spelling errors), so you typically get a higher quality fic every time you load one.

Themes, genres, challenge fics, and other filters let you specify your preferences, including warnings (like rape, abuse, character death, self-harm, etc). The rating scale is different than the standard K-M. I recommend checking it out before searching because "W" means some lemons allowed, and "L" basically mean as lemony as lemons can get.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione quite literally crashes her way back through time by roughly twenty years. There is no going back; the only way is to go forward. And when one unwittingly interferes with time, what one expects may not be what time finds...

** Post tenbras Lux: 10 years after DH, classic.

Cloak of Courage: Hermione is seduced by “Dark” blood magic, and is helped out by Snape, super hot sex, although it doesn't always make sense.

Hermione Granger and the Crystal of Time: Aurette Hermione is 24, working in the Ministry finds out that there is a something which allows someone to go back in time she teams up with the usual suspects, there is a prophesy which states that she will be betrayed by all and everything will hinge on the one who cuts the deepest.

Lay me Low: TeddyRedditor: Hermione is 18 years one month because of the time turner, Snape is not a fantasy version of Snape by any means, probably realistic, parallel timeline fic. Dark and sad. Death Eater Rape.

Killing Time: Lariope post DH, 12 Grimmauld place is a halfway house until Hogwarts reopens, Hermione runs a foundation and wants to change the house system at Hogwarts, Snape helps her and they fall in love, very kind, slow paced, Snape is inexperienced.

The Dissolution Law: miamadwyn So FUCKING SAD. SO good so sad. Short.

Let me know what you think. It's my OTP too.

**** It's definitely the pairing I've read the most. Those are probably my top list but there are a number I have catalogued. But mostly I just look through the favorites of those authors. Loten (author of Chasing the Sun) has a bunch of other great HGSS fics.

*** not that you deserve a justification for what people choose to read about a FICTITIOUS pairing in a FICTITIOUS world, but I personally read this pairing because it's similar to my own experiences (older snarky assholes appear to be my type idk).

So when you say that everyone that reads this pairing is "disturbed" it makes me kinda fucking hate your guts.
