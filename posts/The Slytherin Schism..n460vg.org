By the start of term 1995, Slytherin House has fractured along numerous factional lines. On one side, there are the children of Death Eaters, and other Pureblood Supremacists, who have bought wholly into their parent's ideology, nominally lead by Draco Malfoy, due to him being the most vocally obvious about his loyalties. On the other, a loose confederation of groups that are only really connected by their mutual anti-Death Eater stance, headed by Daphne Greengrass, mostly due to her having been vocally anti-Draco Malfoy since they were both First Years. But with rumours of (or knowledge of, as in the case of the Malfoys) the Dark Lord's return, coupled with Dolores Umbridge's odious presence within Hogwarts, the veritable powder keg that Slytherin House has become over the years needs only the smallest spark to ignite.


** This sounds amazing
