I saw this fic on this subreddit and wow! So sad it's not finished.

Does anyone have any sort of similar fics to recommend?

Pretty different fic, where different witches and wizards of Diagon Alley establishments make Harry his own personal island getaway hidden inside a locket, iirc. Think of Scamander's trunk in Fantastic Beasts and ramp it up a hundredfold, and you get this story.

I haven't seen anything like it, however, [[/u/MagicMistoffelees]]

**** Hmm, I remember there being a lot of fics with tardis-trunks but they kinda fell out of fashion a while back.

I forget the name but I know there is a Marriage law Harem fic where they basically create a demiplane with "Linked Trucks" or something like that. Sorry I can't be more help.

  His life was never normal, then it becomes truly abnormal. He must save a world he never cared for, but with others ... he can care. H/Hr and maybe others. Rated M to be safe.
