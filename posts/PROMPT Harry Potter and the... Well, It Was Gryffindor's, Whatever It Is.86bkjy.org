Remember that wonderful moment in Chamber of Secrets where Harry got boinked in the head with the Sword Of Gryffindor, which he then used to murder the Basilisk? What if it wasn't a sword, but some other kind of weapon?

Write a scene in which the weapon Harry pulls from the Sorting Hat is not a sword. It's still Gryffindor's weapon, though.

*Requirements:*

- 200+ words long
- includes a fight scene between the Basilisk and Harry
- Harry gets a weapon other than a sword from the Sorting Hat

*Bonus Points for:*

- a really, /really/ obscure weapon that really stretches the definition of the word
- a short backstory as to why Gryffindor got the other weapon instead of a Sword
- Harry misusing the weapon but still killing the Basilisk
- Everyone but Harry accepting that Gryffindor wielded a (whatever it is)
- Harry attempting to kill the Horcruxes with the weapon
- Luna showing up and telling Harry he's using it wrong


** Harry stuffed the Hat on his head and ran behind a massive stone column.

~/Kill the boy!/~ hissed Riddle.

'/Oh, dear me, it's been far too long since I've done something like this. Here, have a weapon, you'll need it./'

Something hit Harry's head with a light thunk. He took the hat off, and found... a yoyo?

Harry had never actually used a yoyo before, but he'd seen Dudley try it countless times. It was supposed to be pretty hard to use, but it was /Dudley/ he was talking about. Harry slid the loop over his finger and stepped out from behind the column, eyes squeezed shut.

He drew back his hand and took a deep breath.

~/There he is! KILL HIM!/~

In a moment, Harry would snap out his hand. The yoyo would smoothly glide down its string, and then the string would wrap around one of the massive snake's teeth. Harry would then swing himself around on the string and kick the snake in its eye.

Harry saw all this happen in his minds eye, and felt the snake move towards him. Unhesitatingly, he snapped out his hand and he felt the yoyo - /loop slide off his finger!/.

"Bugger."

As Harry stood, empty handed, in front of the closest thing to Death Itself most wizards would even think of, his life flashed before his eyes. It wasn't exactly a good one, but the last two years made up for the eleven previous, in his opinion.

And then, a strange, serpentine sneezing sound echoed through the Chamber.

~/What? Basilisk! KILL HIM! He's RIGHT THERE!/~

The closest approximate translation for the Basilisk was something along the lines of "Achoo". Since it is a well known fact that it is anatomically impossible to have one's eyes open while sneezing, Harry figured it was safe to open his.

The Basilisk was thrashing around the chamber, sneezing violently. Harry looked more closely at the beast's snout, and - there! a long, gold string dangled from one of it's nostrils!

The serpent gave another sneeze, the mightiest so far. Its head swung back, and hit the massive statue of Salazar Slytherin. There was the sound of crumbling stone, and the statue collapsed onto the snake. It's tail twitched a few times, before falling limp.

Harry and Tom both walked over to the mess of rubble, almost in a trance. The dust settled, revealing a massive stone nose jammed through the top of the Basilisk's skull. It was quite obviously dead.

"Your basilisk looks dead."

Tom glared at Harry, before grinning maliciously. "Yes, but you are still at my mercy!"

"Between the two of us, which one is real?"

"I AM! I AM LORD VOLDEMORT, AND I WILL LEAVE YOUR BROKEN BODY TO ROT ALONE IN THIS CHAMBER!"

"Yeah, but right now you only exist because of this, yeah?" Harry waved the Diary vaguely over towards Riddle.

"What- No! Don't-"

Harry slammed the Diary down on one of the fangs of the Basilisk's intact lower jaw. It screamed and spewed ink everywhere, and Tom disappeared.

Harry leaned over the massive remains of the snake, and spotted the yoyo. It was gold and silver, and almost entirely encrusted with rubies.

He heard a groan from behind him. Ginny Weasley slowly sat up and looked around. "Hello...?"

Harry sat down next to her. "Hiya."

She stared at him, before looking over at the dead Basilisk and impaled Diary. "Tom... is he gone?"

"Yeah, he's been quite thoroughly impaled."

Ginny stared, before laughing. "Thanks, I guess. How did you do it?"

Harry grinned. "Well, you see, there was this yoyo..."

*[~2000 Years Earlier]*

"I want a Sword."

Salazar leaned over towards his friend. "Godric, everyone wants a Sword. Swords are so /unmemorable!/ You want people to remember you, yeah?"

Godric nodded thoughtfully. "Yeah, I guess..."

"Nobody will remember '/Godric Gryffindor, Dragonslayer/' if you kill it with a sword - /everyone/ does that! No, no, you need something with more... more... /spizzazz!/"

Godric continued nodding thoughtfully. "Yes, yes, I see your point, Salazar. Perhaps some sort of... polearm would be more appropriate?"

"No, no, still too mainstream. Killing things with polearms is easy! Just... stab! No, you need something that requires more /skill/! Something like a whip or a boomerang or gauntlets or-"

Godric gasped and sat up. "I've got it! I'll get a /Yoyo/!"

Salazar grinned widely. "Perfect, my friend! Legends will sing of your exploits for /eras/ to come!"

Gryffindor got up and ran out the Doors. Salazar leaned back and chucked. "Dear Merlin, what a /chump/."

** Harry didn't even know /what/ it was, but it was working great. Riddle's eyes had bulged at the sight of the weapon, and the Basilisk squealed like a kicked puppy. Harry was currently chasing it all around the Chamber, trying bash its scales in with the...well, whatever one calls a pointed club with a thick shaft and a pair of circular arm-guards.

/“Attack him from behind!”/ hissed the shade of future (past?) Lord Voldemort. /“He cannot hurt you then!”/

The Basilisk roared and curled around, snapping its massive jaws at Harry's hind parts. Harry, who'd grown rather attached to his own arse over the past twelve years, dodged quickly. He knew that seeing it go would surely put him in a bad mood. He swung his weapon and missed.

The Basilisk paused, catching its breath. Harry did the same. Despite the advantage the weapon had given him, it was getting harder to use. With every attack, every parry and swing, it expanded, growing heavier and weighing down Harry's arms, so that he had to grip it firmly with both hands.

/“Destroy him!”/ ordered the furious shade. /“He's just a boy! He doesn't know how to use it!”/

The Basilisk eyed Harry warily. Or, rather, the weapon Harry was holding. Harry thought the creature looked scared. What had Godric done to it that it still remembered after centuries of slumber?

/“He's an impotent child! KILL HIM!”/

The Basilisk roared again. Harry, preparing for the incoming attack, shifted his grip on the weapon, which suddenly pulsed in his hands and began to throb.

“What the--” Harry began, but then it was too late. With the speed and fury of an incoming ballistic missile, the Basilisk charged forward, and the weapon in Harry's hands erupted. Strands of sticky white webbing shot from the tip, entangling the poor snek until it was nothing but a mound under a mountain of white goo. Harry thought he could hear it crying in parseltongue.

/Not again. Not again./

He actually felt bad for the creature, but then it probably shouldn't have tried to kill him.

Harry looked around. Riddle was nowhere to be seen; presumably, the past (future?) Dark Lord had fled, cowed by the amazing display of Harry's prowess. Harry lowered his weapon, and then nearly jumped when the Sorting Hat spoke.

“Now, dear boy, don't get attached. It was just a loan, you know that, right? You have to put it back.”

“You want me to put in back in?” asked Harry.

“Well, of course! What else would you do with it -- walk around Hogwarts, swinging it left and right? No, m'boy, in it goes. Quickly now, don't keep me waiting.”

Harry sighed and got down on his knees to do as the Sorting Hat requested. This was all very strange, he thought. He should ask Hermione about it later; she'd definitely know.

Right?

** Something very heavy indeed cracked down onto the top of Harry's skull. He saw stars (none of them recognizable from Astronomy class) and fell to the ground. Riddle was bent double laughing and even the Basilisk seemed a little confused.

Feebly, Harry felt inside the hat. His nails scrabbled against a smooth, cold metallic surface until he found an edge and /pulled/. The Sorting Hat let out a sort of stifled scream as a humongous shield emerged from its depths. This was very disturbing, thought Harry.

The Sorting Hat whimpered as more and more of the shield appeared. "Oh for Merlin's sake, just get it out of me already, boy!" Harry was dimly aware of Riddle now rolling helplessly on the ground, laughing uncontrollably. The Basilisk remained reared in the air, unsure what these silly /snacks/ were up to.

Harry strained desperately and the last of the shield flew out of the Sorting Hat, throwing him almost halfway to the other side of the Chamber. The Basilisk hissed in amusement as Riddle howled with laughter.

"Potter-HOO-HAHA-Potter just give up already, I can't possibly take this- HEE-HEE- level of incompetence from my nemesis! Stop it!"

Harry struggled with the shield. Even on the ground, he could see it was twice as tall and at least as wide as he was. It was a silver shield, stylised with a red embossed lion with rubies for eyes and a rather constipated expression. At least he thought it looked constipated. The wretched thing had hit his head quite hard, so please excuse him if he was being overly critical of a ruddy big shield.

On the other side of the Chamber, the Sorting Hat simply sighed in relief. That oversized excuse for a dinner plate had been inside the Hat for centuries. It rather fancied it had burst a seam or two getting it out. No more having to clench during Sorting Ceremonies to avoid killing an unlucky first year. Bliss.

Harry managed to flip the shield over, and found a handle. As soon as he touched it, the shield seemed to grow a thousand times lighter. He rose to his feet, hefting the massive shield rather awkwardly. Black spots swam across his vision before he steadied himself, leaning on the shield for support. He still had to deal with Riddle and that great big scaly pet of his.

Riddle managed to pick his increasingly more corporeal self off the ground, clutching a hand to his ribs. Laughing so hard /hurt/, especially after fifty years of inactivity. He wiped not-quite-ghostly tears from his eyes. "Well Potter, that was quite possibly the most... Oh give me a second, this is hilarious... Whew... The most underwhelming 'hero gets a magical artifact' moment since Arthur tripped over a butter knife in that rock in Wales."

His eyes flashed red as he slipped into Parseltongue again.

"/Kill him, dear serpent of mine/"

The Basilisk rolled her eyes. Master was always such a drama queen, seriously. She began to slither towards the /snack/, and reared her head to strike. The /snack/ blinked woozily, not even looking directly at her. She flickered her tongue, tasting the air. Yep, there was blood to scent. The poor /snack/ had to have gotten a concussion from that /knight food packaging lid/. Oh well. Orders were orders and she was /hungry/.

She slammed her head down at the little /snack/ as Riddle cackled manaically. The /snack/ didn't even react, still blinking. Just as she was about to close her jaws around her prey, he slipped and the shield got caught in her throat, lodging itself firmly between the two sets of fangs. She froze.

Harry was also frozen. By all rights he should be dead but he was still hanging onto the shield handle and still alive. Still in pain but alive. He blinked once more, slowly.

Riddle screamed in rage as he saw what had happened. "/Crush him you fool!/"

The massive snake begin to slam her head against the ground, against the walls, anything to try and kill the /snack/ and dislodge the shield in her throat. She was panicking now, dust pouring down from the walls from the force of her blows.

Harry could do nothing but hang onto the shield as the snake thrashed around. Every time he was flung against the walls or the flagstones, he winced in anticipation of being squished but every time an shimmering orange shield burst out from the shield and cushioned the impact. He was perfectly safe but the momentum changes were jolting his shoulder and he was getting rather tired.

The Basilisk too was tired. Her head was bruised, she was sure she was after losing a scale from hitting one of those stalactites and the /snack/ still wasn't dead! She ignored her Master's shrieks of outrage and simply laid her head down on the cold stones of the Chamber. If a snake could whine, she would be doing it right at that moment. She wasn't paid in enough /snacks/ for this horseshit. Mhmm.. Horses...

Harry's legs nearly buckled as the ground met them again. He peered around the corner of the shield and recoiled as soon as he saw a hint of the yellow eyes of the Basilisk. He wasn't even listening to Riddle any more, who had driven himself into a near apoleptic fit at his pet's failure to kill him. Harry knew that if he let go of the shield, he would probably lose whatever protection it gave him.

He stood and pondered the dilemma he faced. If he let go, the snake would be able to kill him. If he didn't do something, Ginny would die soon, and Riddle would become more physical. Harry thought and thought and thought, as the snake sulked, Riddle raged and Ginny.... Ginny vegetated. She was good at that, was Ginny.

Harry suddenly came upon a thought. Riddle had been talking to him to before through the diary. He'd seen the ghostly boy before, one of his memories. The diary must be the source of Riddle's power!

He could see it, beside Ginny's comatose form. And if he couldn't leave the shield behind, he was going to bring it with him.

Harry /pulled/.

The snake slithered along after him, helpless to resist. The shield could block anything the user wanted it to, and right now Harry was impatient to get this over it. He dragged the massive serpent along, pulling the shield after him, marching towards the Diary.

Riddle realised that his clumsy nemesis had figured it out. He screamed incoherently and began casting spell after spell at the boy. Bone-crushing curse, jelly-legs jinx, even Avada Kedavra. Every one of his spells splashed against the shimmering orange shield around Potter, sending ripples across it but never getting through to his enemy. He threw the wand behind him, running up to Potter and trying to hit him with his balled fists. Every hit simply glanced off the shield, sending another lazy ripple across it. Potter just kept going, marching stolidly towards his goal.

Harry reached the prone form of Ginny and looked down at her. She was still and her hair spilled out around her like a red shimmering halo. Harry blinked, once, twice, and then vomited on her. All this movement wasn't good for him. He had a serious head injury and a terrible sense of urgency. Ginny would forgive him for puking on her, but the laundry house elves might not. Or maybe they'd enjoy the extra challenge of getting partially digested treacle tart out of robes. Who knows? We don't find out about the Hogwarts Elves till the Tournament debacle anyways.

Harry blinked again, wiping his mouth with a sleeve. He needed to finish this before the hallucinatory thoughts got worse. He picked up the book, and began to look around for a way to destroy it.

Riddle cracked, finally. He got down on his hands and knees and began to beg Harry to reconsider, that the whole "killing all the Mudbloods" thing was just a bit of light hearted fun, and he was very sorry that his older self had murdered all those people and Potter's parents and all that rubbish, and "would you /please/ just let my soul receptacle alone until I'm alive enough to annihilated you? It'll only take a minute, I swear."

Behind both of them, the Basilisk just rolled her very deadly eyes. First she couldn't eat any of her petrified victims, then Master had to make her try and eat a /snack/ with a very tough carapace and now she had been dragged around helplessly and Master was being, quite frankly, a 'lil bitch. Venom glistened at the tip of her fangs in frustration.

Harry saw the venom. He saw the panicked look on Riddle's face upon seeing that Harry had seen the venom. Harry moved the book closer to the fang. Riddle whimpered and finally shut up, pressing his face against the magical shield that was emitted by another, more magical shield. Harry leaned in, real close and whispered "I've had enough of this shit for today, Tom."

With that, he slammed the book down onto the fang, impaling it. Riddle slowly faded, cursing Godrjc Gryffindor and all his works as he went. The Basilisk flicked her tail in irritation, All the ink from the diary was getting into her mouth, and it tasted bitter. With one final flash of light, Riddle disappeared and his hold over the snake with it.

*** Harry peered around the shield. The snake's eyes were closed. He rather fancied that since Riddle was gone, and he was the only other Parselmouth in the school, she might follow his orders. He noticed the flicking tail.

"/If I get this shield out of your mouth, would you leave my friend and I alone and go back to sleep? Shake your tail once for yes, twice for no./"

The snake twitched the tail once.

"/keep your eyes closed and I'll get it out. Go straight back into the creepy man statue and don't come out till I call you again. Agreed?/"

One shake of the tail.

Harry sighed with relief, angling the pointy end of the shield out of the mouth of the snake and freeing it from her mouth. He pulled the remains of the diary from her fang and watched as the snake shook her head in relief, before sliding across and into the statue of Salazar Slytherin, Tackiest of the Hogwarts Four.

He collapsed beside Ginny's body, still holding onto the shield. He really needed to lie down for a while. Just to rest his eyes, you see.

For a while, nothing was heard in the Chamber. The Sorting Hat eventually spoke up, screaming at the feathered creature that was nestled on the far side of the Chamber.

"Fawkes, you useless parrot, get down here and take us home. I think that Shield ripped my brim. Both the Boy and I need stitches, so hop to it, Fire Chicken."

Fawkes, who during the entire battle had been preening on Salazar's nose, shook his feathers angrily and swooped down to the Hat and the students. He bit his beak into the Hat and hooked his talons into the two flightless monkeys before flying lazily off to the exit. The flightless old monkey better have treats for him after this.

*and so ends the confrontation between Harry Potter and the Massive Fuck Off Shield. This is very crack-ish. Sorry :)*
