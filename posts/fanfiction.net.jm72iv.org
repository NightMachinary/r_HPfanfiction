** From what I have seen these are the following issues.

â€‹

1. New stories when clicked give the following error (Story Not FoundStory is unavailable for reading. (A))
2. Updated stories give the following (Chapter not found)
3. Not all users will have these issues
4. The app I use runs into issues downloading new chapters
5. One newly updated chapter I was able to access showed incorrect date but the email had been sent today. Said chapter cannot be accessed now.

Don't know if they are working on it, the sites twitter account shows no activity since third of October.
