So a couple months ago I read this fic that was recommended on here as a sad/make-you-cry fic.

It has Lily Luna as a squib, but it's short and has Harry actually join her in the muggle world, being nothing but supportive and Ginny essentially pretending Lily doesn't exist.

If anyone knows of it or can find it, please help! I've searched this subreddit and ffnet for ages at this point!

Thanks!

*** I'm not sure if your comment is supposed to be sarcastic or not.

If it was meant o be sarcastic, lol.

if not, everyone has their own likes and dislikes in fanfiction, and this fic is honestly tragic and beautiful to me, so I can enjoy an OOC Ginny if I'd like. Be careful to be courteous to other people who have different tastes than you, I enjoy OOC, AU, and a lot of other tropes people yell at me for, and I never really appreciate when someone tries to force their opinions on my reading preferences.

***** Nah, I don't think they were trying to come after you for being rude, but I've also noticed how people on this site tend to jump down the throat of tropes they dislike. Sounds just like a word of warning, no harm :)

*** When is Ginny shown as supportive of squibs? The Weasleys in general ignore their accountant cousin, who I've read was confirmed to be a squib. Maybe she got it from her family and the squibphobia was stronger than whatever maternal stuff she picked up from her parents.

**** But it's her own daughter. Maybe they ignore that cousin because he's unpleasant or because he cut himself away from the magical world and they were upset by him. The Weasleys are accepting and they're the biggest blood traitors there are. I'm sure that they have no problem with squibs. Arabella Figg was a squib and they worked alongside her with the Order. I just can't see it happening. They're not anti muggle so they're most likely not anti squib. Both don't know magic.

***** Wait, are you really citing the weird cat lady who lives alone in her house in a suburb as a positive example of relating to squibs? Even the "good guys" and most progressives of the Wizarding World treat her as some kind of leper. Is she ever included in anything except when they need something from her?

******** I don't know. But I honestly think that Dumbledore valued every member and made them attend. That's just how I view it. Besides, we know that members of the Order watched one over Harry from under the cloak so she might've actually attnedd meetings.

********* Members of the order watched over Harry from beneath the cloak to protect him. A squib would not be able to protect him from wizards. Figg was a source of dumbledore's who did him favors, she never went to an order meeting.

** I've actually read this story. It was really sad and Lily Luna was totally alienated from everyone, even her siblings, except for Harry. Don't remember what it's called though. I wouldn't mind reading it again.
