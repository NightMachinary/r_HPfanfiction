I know there's a couple where it's mentioned that Harry is immune to poisons because of the venom but it's not a big part of the story. Are there any fics that come to mind where either one or both affect him in some way that actually matters.


** "Cold Blood". That combination has far-reaching effects in that story, central to the plot.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.
