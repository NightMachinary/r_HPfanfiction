I've been wanting to read a powerful! Harry fic, not powerful as in magical power (boy wouldn't mind) but as in authority. Something like I'm "Do you know who am I? Harry bleeding Potter and I can do whatever I want". Thanks!

** You can read any Lord Harry fics. All he says is ' I am Lord Potter-Peverell-Gryffindore-...-Slytherin' and everyone do what he says.
