You know, different name, different appearances, nobody knows his true identity. I was actually interested if there are such fics where Dumbledore knows about it from the start but any would do.

(But imagine. Dumbledore understands that leaving Harry with Dursleys is a bad idea. And he comes up with a plan which he doesn't tell anybody about. He fakes the boy's disappearance after a few days under mysterious circumstances. He somehow changes his appearances and puts Harry with a good magical family. Ignorance is a good protection. And he can manage society's uproar.)

I remember these two: linkffn(The Hidden Hero) and linkffn(Gabriel by Shikatanai)

  The summer prior to 6th year Harry deals with Tom in a decisive, if accidental manner. That summer Harry gets a girl friend in Susan Bones, and sets about some self improvement. It is after this change to himself he discovers something a bit disturbing about the Wizarding World, something that Hermione Granger is determined to use to her advantage.

** - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2428341/1/Mastermind-Hunting][/Mastermind Hunting/]] --- A lot happens in this story before Harry's first year even starts --- and this is also one of the stories that can be recommended in the “world-travelling Harry” request threads. Overall, I'd say it's a pretty decent read, even if it does have its bad moments. Among the problems with this story are some goofy plot arcs and plot devices; Harry being too OP (please nerf); Voldemort, Dumbledore and Snape being underpowered (both intellectually and magically); the ending being a sudden clusterfuck out of nowhere; etc.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4573620/1/A-Drop-of-Poison][/A Drop of Poison/]] --- this one's a Naruto fanfic, if that's also your kinda thing. When Naruto's made to fail the genin exams yet again and has to spend yet another year in the academy, he decides to enter as three separate people at the same time. He clues Iruka-sensei in, explains it as a controlled experiment that will show how capable he actually is, and how much do the teachers actually work against him to make him fail year after yaer. Among the drawbacks is a broken magical system that can make anyone above a certain +mana+ chakra threshold way too OP (IIRC).
