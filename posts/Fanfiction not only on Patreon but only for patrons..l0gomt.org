Recently, I noticed that more and more fanfiction authors are using Patreon. However, there are different approaches to using it:\\
1) Posting on Patreon, but for everyone and later on fanfiction net, while also having original works on Patreon for patrons. An example would be DarknessEnthroned author of a great and known fanfiction 'A Cadmean Victory'.

2) Posting on Patreon only for patrons both original and fanficiton, but after some delay, fanfiction appears on fanficiton net. An example would be TheBlack'sResurgence author of "Honour Thy Blood".

I know that there are different opinions about Patreon used by fanfiction writers and I can understand different points of view, but I want to ask where do you think the crossing line lies? Are Patreon users using approach 2) can one day face legal consequences that can be a huge blow to the whole fandom?

What do you think about this situation in general?\\

** It's a fairly difficult question. I'm not fully familiar with how patreon works, it's not something I've looked into personally.

From what I've been informed, it's if you like the art of a person, and you pay them to encourage and support them. If you follow the lines of that argument, then by the technicalities of law, they are clear of any liabilities.

However if they charge for things as in " you need to pay to read this story. " In that case, they will be liable.

Also seeing that it's being made available for free in some period of time, a mere delay in availability, it's complete fine. Provided a court interprets Patreon as a private platform.

Basically, it's the person and their service they pay for, and that means it's clear with respect to IP law. If it's the item or product, then you'll be in trouble.

Although, it'll always change with the social, political views of country to country.

** 1 is fine, but a little dodgy. The author has found a following on one site and is now using it to indirectly advertise himself on another site.

2 is immoral and illegal(?). To charge others for writing fanfiction (which is based on someone else's intellectual property) is, in my opinion, the height of moral bankruptcy for a member of a fandom.

** Fanfiction, legally speaking, is in a bit of an odd territory. IP Law is so obnoxious and complicated (and varying across different countries) that lawyers are still arguing to this day about fanfic and it's been thirty+ years. In the US system (most fic sites are hosted there, so it's the most relevant), fic is justified under a couple pieces of fair use legislation that basically state reusing active-IP (ie. anything not in the public domain) is okay in certain specific contexts (education, parody, transformative works, etc) so long as it meets some certain criteria (not-plagiarised, non-commercial, not taking revenue/interest from the original work, that kind of thing).

But despite any legal arguments, fic generally continues to exist only at the whims and tolerance of the author and their publishers. Most of the bigger authors/publishers (which generally produce the stuff for the big fandoms) have enough resources to ruin pretty much any fanfic author with little effort and most who allow it generally have two rules - don't show it to them (authors pick up phrases and ideas from everywhere and they don't wanna steal from fans) and don't charge for it.

Technically speaking, there's a decent-ish legal argument that you can charge for fanfiction if you're sufficiently transformative (meaning coffeeshop AUs are actually the most marketable fanfiction :D), but for the most part it's simply "Don't charge and don't copy" and that's what keeps it going.

If people charging for fics start to get enough attention, I imagine a lot of authors will start cracking down simply to protect their IP (like Star Wars keeps doing with fan-games) and in all honesty I couldn't entirely blame them. I'd certainly be irritated if someone stole my work and fiddled with it a bit, then tried to sell it as theirs.

Personally, I like Eric Flint's approach. Essentially embrace the fandom of your work, then help them cultivate it into an extended universe. He releases bimonthly magazines with various fan-written short stories set in his universe - gets them edited and published and everything. Pretty cool, and definitely something I'd try for if I were ever a published author.

** While I haven't seen it used for fanfic purposes yet, I have seen it used for romhacks (basically mods of console games, from things like translations, to complete conversions), which bears some similarity. I don't like it, and I'm fairly sure it's not even legal. The moment you request money for something beyond some minor maintenance-related corner cases (shipping costs of fanzines or similar), your work isn't really a hobby project anymore IMO, and you're basically profiting from someone else's work. I also think it means it's no longer fair use, but I'm not really familiar enough with US law to say that with confidence.
