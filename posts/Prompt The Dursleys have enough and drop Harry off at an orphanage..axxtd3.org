They never tell them his full name and he's too young to know it so they call him Harry Riddle.

He figures out magic on his own, deals with bullies in creative ways, and then one day Dumbledore shows up and sets his belongings on fire.

Because that always went well.


** This would work if orphanages were still a thing in the UK in the 1980s. Surrey County Council childrens' services department would have emergency foster carers on their books for a foundling child, and would fairly quickly be moved to at least long term foster care at the very least with adoption possibly following. Only kids with serious behavioural issues ended up in permanent residential care of the local authority. Had the Dursleys abandoned Harry, he would have grown up with a perfectly normal muggle family in Woking or Guildford with a foster-sibling or two.

***** I know there are several fics that feature muggle bureaucracy slowly getting wise to magic because memory charms don't affect paper records or computers, but I'd really like to read one where it's the main focus. Preferably without a moustache-twirling villain Dumbledore, though.

*** Yes! A huge pet peeve of mine is orphanages. Not that it doesn't provide an interesting plot point but because it shows the author is half assing things at best.

A story I've been writing slowly and unsuccessfully for years is nearly what you've prompted here. Harry ends up in the foster system, but it doesn't go well. It's a Neville BWL story since in canon Dumbledore would've noticed Harry going missing and gotten him somewhere more secure. Harry using accidental magic a lot as a kid keeps him bouncing around from home to home, which to the system reads as behavioral problems so he ends up in long term housing. IE the modern orphanage. The idea was spawned from the desire to see Tom Riddle except not evil. So Harry has the same sort of grasp on magic, but with more showing off and less hurting people.

How about: Dursleys drop Harry at an institute to help children with psychological issues?

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

**** Well, in the first instance, ignorance. There's still a widespread perception that orphanages are a thing, and even those who know they're not any more think that residential care isn't the absolute last resort that it in fact is.

And the second point, once you get past that lack of education (which requires more than a trivial amount of fairly boring study) you discover that the reality isn't really a great source of dramatic oomph. Harry growing up in a just-short-of-criminal abusive home puts him squarely in the Cinderella Tradition. Storybook heroes don't grow up in slightly boring foster homes in Woking. (Knew a chap at school who grew up this way with a small assortment of foster siblings. He seemed to be doing OK when last I saw him, which was admittedly over thirty years ago.)

Completely and totally disagree with this second point. I don't want a wangst fic like this, I'm a fix-fic type of guy and a well adjusted and nice foster family background for Harry sounds like a great start to a fix fic. Plenty exist, but I don't know of any that involve the government child services.

****** I should have let my inner critic say what he wanted to, it seems. A well adjusted nice foster family background is a lot more work /for the writer/. Wangst is /easy/, showing a hero growing from nothing is easier than showing a hero growing from a comfortable position. A central character who has been bashed flat by abuse is a lot easier to develop. And fanfic writers - who are often beginners or part-timers - do tend to take the easy option. Or at least, if they diverge from canon, do so in the direction of making things /worse/. Because, as I say, it's dramatically easier to start from Cinderella In Her Kitchen than it is from well-raised middle-class kid.

If I was going to do it, I'd give Harry the 'light side' version of the Dursleys for foster parents. They want the kids that they take in to learn the value of normality and conformity and are /really good/ at teaching those values and reinforcing them with appropriate rewards. They bring Harry up to have a life goal of Getting a 2:1 Degree and Getting A Proper Job. By 11, Harry has his heart set on a career as a Solicitor, and if he can't make that, a Chartered Accountant.*

Let's see you raise /that/ like a pig for slaughter, Dumbledore.

*Before you decry this as unrealistic, this was me at 11, which was about the age I realised I was never going to make it as a bomber pilot what with the shitty eyesight and the asthma.
