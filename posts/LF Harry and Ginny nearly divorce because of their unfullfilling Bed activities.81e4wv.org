So, they love each other, but the flame is getting dimly and they are about to divorce, when an Event or Situations happens that fire up their Libido and they have a Passionate Night for themselfes. If they still intent to divorce, because it was just "an urge" or an "itch that needed to be scratch" or decide to stay together, i let the Fic decide.
