:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
A random detail of a fic came back to me last night and i can think for the life if me what it it.

Basically instead of calling the DA the DA they decide to call it something else, like SWORD or SWAT, and im sure it stands "Society of wizards against......" something or its along those lines. Im almost sure they change its name because Draco, or one of the slytherins, mention that Dumbledore could get in trouble. I think they also changed the name of SPEW to something else because they slytherins refused to be apart of something called SPEW.

Drarry fic, or draco is at least friends with the golden trio, it also could be a slytherin harry fic. But also written this out made me think it might also be a series. Im not sure.


** Against terrorism? Against tyranny? Against trychophobia?
