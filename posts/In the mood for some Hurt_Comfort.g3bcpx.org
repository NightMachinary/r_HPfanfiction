Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes, Bisexual and Asexual. Doesn't have to be focused on a pairing.

ANYONE can be the main character, can be from any era, can be on any site, can have any warnings.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.

If it's Harry centric, I'd rather not have OP Harry or Lord Potter. Harry slightly more powerful or slightly smarter then in canon is fine, but I'd like for it to be relatively believable.

If the Weasley's are a focus, would rather NOT have Weasley bashing.

  They have Shepard's pie for dinner. Ron and Hermione watch Harry fill up his plate and only start serving themselves when he picks up his fork and starts eating. Neville laughs into his wine glass.“How are you dealing with their mothering, Harry?” he asks.Ron opens and closes his mouth for a minute, groping for an excuse. Eventually, Ron says, “He's just so small, Nev.”“Hey,” Harry says. “I'm seventeen. I'm an adult.”Ron shakes his head at Neville. “My best friend is an infant.” A curse regresses Harry to his seventeen year old self, physically and mentally. He doesn't recognise this strange peaceful wizarding world, but there are two people he does recognise: Ron and Hermione. Based off this tumblr post.

** Have you read linkffn(Grow Young With Me)? I recommend ignoring the summary, which doesn't give an accurate impression of the fic, and just trying out chapter 1 to see whether you like Abby.

The overview I gave someone recently was:

Harry is widowed and raising his three children alone, devoted to them but really hurting. A quirky waitress (with her own issues under the surface) takes on the self-assigned job of drawing him out of his funk, and they slowly fall for each other. But even if she can win over his children, even if he can let himself love again after losing Ginny, there's still a side of his life that she's not supposed to know about. And the more she sees his home and his in-laws, the harder it is to keep a lid on exactly what he does for a living, how he can regularly drop his children off with their grandparents on the other side of the country, and why he has genuine /cauldrons/ in his cupboards...

It was last updated in December.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.
