I know that the story of someone (usually Harry) traveling back in time to stop Tom killing half the planet has been done by several people..

Could you please link the ones you know? Preferably written by grammatically competent people

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3340028/chapters/7305341][Crawlersout]] This is one of my favourites, very well written and the writing of Tom is on point. Premise is that Female Harry adopts Tom by going back in time. Sort of. Very slow updates but to my knowledge it is still updating. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did
