Working on a year end prank against slytherin in darkness ascendant: so far the lead prank is the slytherin dorms/common room filling with motile jelly snakes that multiply when vanished or destroyed but disappear a thousand for each one eaten. Got a better prank or a modification to this one you'd like me to use?


** Whenever I think about pranks, I want to see one with a small floating trumpet floating around behind someone and playing an ongoing soundtrack for them.

And then doing the same trick with different instruments on a whole bunch of different people, with the added quirk that if they're all in one place than the different flying instruments play in harmony.

Alternatively you could just remodel the Great Hall into something aquarium-esque, complete with airborne tropical fish.

*** Draco already had yakkety sax playing when he drew his wand for a while and then has the floor go frictionless on him in the great hall.

I do like the symphony aspect though.
