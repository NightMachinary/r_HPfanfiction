Well, I think this is a discussion, not really sure.

Anyway, I was talking with my gf and the topic about familiars came up. I'm not sure if they are a thing in the HPverse, but I like the idea.

So, I went looking for fics with Harry having one, besides the classic Hedwig. I did not found something of my taste that I have not already read, but that's besides the point.

How do you all feel about Harry or anyone else having a magical creature as a familiar? What creature would you like to see in a fic? Be it for usefulness or just personal taste, what would you like to have as a familiar?

I want a dragon. I know that it would probably eat me, but hey, giant firebreathing lizard is worth a shot.


** I like as long as the creature isn't too OP. I remember one where Harry had some sort of OP black bird that could kill people by looking at them...

My favorite is a snake. Just Harry having a conversation with a snake would be cool

** I always see people give him a snake which is cool and all but gets a bit cringeworthy since it's so overused

*** Well, I don't share your opinion, but I can see from where you are coming.

I don't think there's inherently edginess in the concept, just ways of aproaching it. If they don't talk or turn to humans for me it's at least okey.

Thanks for commenting!
