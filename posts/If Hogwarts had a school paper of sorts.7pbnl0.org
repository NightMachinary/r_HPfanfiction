Who would be the advisor? Or would none of the teachers have time to be an advisor? I had in mind McGonagall or maybe the Muggle Studies Professor. I know I ask a lot of questions here but I'll stop asking after this one.


** There's nothing wrong with asking questions.

As a whole we don't really see a lot of extra curricular activities from teachers in Harry Potter. The closest example I can think of is that the movies sort of present Flitwick as being involved in a school choir of sorts. But at the same time, the quidditch teams don't even really have a coach and are mostly just left to the students.

I would highly doubt that it would be an issue of 'time' from the teachers. Perhaps more interest. It could, conceivably, be any of the professors.

My own experience with school papers was very 'hands-off' from the teachers/professors. They mostly only made their presence known in event of an issue of sorts.

Perhaps the entire thing is best if done as a student-run organization with minimal oversight from a professor. At that point it doesn't really matter who the professor is as they shouldn't appear often.

** You don't really get school papers in the UK -- and certainly not a boarding school. Authors are welcome to write what they wish, of course, but I find the idea a bit strange.

** I wasn't necessarily asking for recommendations but thanks. I was curious because I'm thinking about having a school paper in my newest story.

** Likely a prof that doesn't have other duties (Head of House, groundskeeper, referee, etc.), so probably one of the elective teachers (though I'm curious how full Hooch's schedule really is).

I think in the schools I've been to, it's generally the English teachers who get the job foisted on them. Unfortunately, not an option in Hogwarts without some AU fiddling.

I like the idea. Seen it in a couple fics. Opens up getting Harry's story/yearly adventures out into the open without having the super awkward Great Hall scene where everyone listens in. Could also use it to discuss social issues and things like types of classes offered, anything that's glossed over in canon.
