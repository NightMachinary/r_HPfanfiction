:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic that I read some time ago that features Hermione and Ginny in a relationship. Set in year six/seven from Ginny's point of view, no Voldemort, lots of drama and misunderstandings. Hermione eventually graduates and takes up a job at the French MOM, with some drama unfolding there.
