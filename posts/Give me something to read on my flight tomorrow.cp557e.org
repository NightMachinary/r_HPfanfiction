** A few things come to mind that fit this.

linkffn(With Strength of Steel Wings) is pretty good, but the writer's strengths lay more in character interaction than in plot, so be warned. It is however incredibly long. Very, Very slow updates (but the writer is working at it again, they said so in the Epilogue of Blindness)

linkffn(Itachi, is that a baby?) is long and hysterical. Quite good in terms of grammar, and despite being crack actually does take a number of things seriously.

linkffn(The Song of the Trees) is a good mystery that is stopped right after the climax began. The mystery is solved by this point, it's really just wrapping up loose ends that's left, and the end of the climax.

linkffn(Teeth by hathanhate) is an interesting Avengers crossover. Very long, also not updated in quite some time.

linkffn(Broken Mind, Fractured Soul by Sensibly Tainted) is an interesting (if old) fic covering Multiple Personality Disorder. It is preslash, and the sequel /is/ slash, but overall it is quite good.

The Black Queen series by Silently Watches is pretty good, and also portrays a bunch of *horrible* people as the protagonists. I won't link it because of the Reddit rules. Four books, all complete however. The first chapter or two of Princess of the Blacks is very difficult to read, but is probably the darkest the series ever gets. Prepare for gore later on though.

linkffn(The Little Veela that Could) is pretty good (and complete), and does some very creative things with Christian lore.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Third Key: Reloaded) is long and very creative, but isn't tagged with much of anything so not many have read it. Awesome fights scenes though.

linkffn(Moon and Stone by Andrea13 and PersephoneKore) is a bit shortish, but is a really cool backstory of the Chamber of Secrets.

linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) is a three and 1/100 book series that is quite old but has some good fights in it. The fourth book is only just started and very much abandoned, but Voldemort is dealt with quite handily by the end of book three. It could easily be called a trilogy really. This writer has some issues with repeating phrases but the grammar is pretty good otherwise.

linkffn(Never Alone, Never Again by Bored Beyond Belief) is ancient (2003!) but has actually aged fairly well. Grammar is excellent.

Aaaaaand I'm done. Cheers

  In 1993, Gilderoy Lockhart points a stolen wand at Harry Potter and Ron Weasley with the intent to Obliviate them.The wand doesn't backfire. Gilderoy's "discovery" of the Chamber of Secrets is a short-term success.Other consequences are not short-term at all.

** Have you read Antithesis? It is long but at the same time good and not boring.

New blood is also good and has a slytherin Hermione (But realistic, and it does not take away everything of what hermione used to be, you can still see parts of the cannon one there too)

If you want mystery, Basilisk Born by Ebenbild should do it. Nearly (Very nearly) complete. I would reccomend a long journey home but it is not as long and it does not have the same feeling of mystery.

Do you like horror? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2452681/1/Evil-Be-Thou-My-Good]] is the longest good horror fic I have seen, with 40000 words but still a one shot (but large)\\

** A popular fanfic I would recommend is linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8186071]]). It has 106 chapters and each chapter has quite a lot of content. This kept me busy for quite a while. But if you're not into cliché fanfics, it probably won't be your cup of tea. I highly recommend checking RobSt's works out. Safe flight!

It's not precisely /cliches/ that people complain about in Harry Crow; it's his [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue][Sue-ness]] (caution: TVTropes). Everything goes right for him, he's better than everyone at everything. Stories generally need conflict to be interesting, they need to challenge the protagonist(s) and have them overcome the challenge. If there isn't any credible threat or difficulty, it tends to be bland.
