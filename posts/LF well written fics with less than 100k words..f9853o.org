I'd like to read some shorter fics. Preferably stories that are completed or updated regularly. No main character slash, but other than that, anything is fine.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

** SELF-PROMO:

*Summary:* Fem!Harry with Muggle-world connections. Canon didn't touch on what life was like for Muggleborns and Muggle-raised students that actually /wanted/ to keep in touch with their Muggle heritage and friendships, so I used that as a starting point. I'm keeping the main canon in the background while Fem!Harry and co do their thing. Covering Years 1-4. No wizardwank, No Mugglewank.

#+begin_quote
  A young wizard returns from the dead, not knowing who he his or what happened to him. He grudgingly accepts help from old colleagues and new acquaintances to reclaim his past, but finds out more than he bargained for. Will he vanquish his demons in time to help a new friend in need - or will he prove himself irredeemable once and for all?

  Ginny made a thin, distressed sound. “I ... Look, I promised Tom I wouldn't let him be handed in,” she said in a small voice.“Well, if he's going to go around petrifying people, I don't see much reason why people ought to keep their promises to him,” said Hermione crossly.
