Looking for wholesome romance stories. Where they fall in love and have tear jerking declarations etc. It doesn't have to be ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù.

Thank you for your help folks!

** I'm so sorry that you've yet to get a proper answer to your question! I've got some lists I compiled myself, with brief thoughts on each of the fics I mention in them to try to help give you an idea of what I thought of them.

This first [[https://mirimora.tumblr.com/post/617977831628161024/snarry-short-fic-rec-list][list]] is for fics under 50,000 words, and the second [[https://mirimora.tumblr.com/post/611016217561579520/snarry-long-fic-rec-list][one]] is for fics over 50k wc. The ones I'd really stress that I love and would start with are both number ones, for sure. Also, I would move the Pacify series higher up on my list since I originally made the post. It is up to five parts in the series, and it's just gorgeously written and bursting with emotion. Do mind the tags on that one, though. It is very kink heavy, especially in the first three parts.

I would urge you to check out the rest of an author's catalog of works if you especially enjoy something they've done because often I'll devour most of what someone writes if I really click with their style. Hippocrates460, bleedcolor, Likelightinglass, pluperfectsunrise, and emynn are a few that this has been true of for me. You can find all of them on my Tumblr lists I've linked.

Also, [[https://archiveofourown.org/collections/Snarry_a_Thon20/works][Snarry-A-Thon]] this year was especially fantastic for new Harry/Severus stories. A few that struck me as especially romantic were /a scratch for every itch/, /CURSE/, /A Beginner's Guide to Breaking Up with Your In-Laws/, and /The Detective's Ballet/. I enjoyed others, but those were the ones I thought fit your ask the most closely. Also, I left out my own since I'd be a bit biased, haha. Sorry this got so long, but I hope you find something you haven't read that you can enjoy! Feel free to message me if you have any questions or need help narrowing things down. I know I tend to go a bit overboard. üòÖ
