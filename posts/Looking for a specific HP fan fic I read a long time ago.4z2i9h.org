This fan fic was unique in that Harry had wings later. Many thought he was an angel. He ends up in a church with a mute auror, fights bellatrix, and a bunch of other deatheaters right after which he uses some purifying spell on. Fic was incomplete. Harry and Luna ship. Anybody remember the name of this fic? It turned out to be better than I expected. Albus and Fawkes tried to teach him to fly(pretty comical)
