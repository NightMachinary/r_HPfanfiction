** On that note, I read once a fic where the Chamber of Secrets was in fact a prison created by the Founders to trap Lucifer in and the Basilisk was Slytherin's protection against people potentially breaking him out. Young Tom met Lucifer who taught him about Horcruxes in exchange for giving him the souls of the victims he'd kill to make them. However Tom didn't realize that Lucifer played him for a fool and knew from the start that Tom in his arrogance would make enough enemies that one would bring about his downfall and then his soul would also belong to the devil.

I can't remember the name of the fic but if anyone remembers reading it, please let me know. Thanks!
