I'll be honest. I am trying to write a fic where the love interest of the male protagonist is manipulating him to do evil deeds. She exerts a lot of power over him using her feminine charms and the fact that he is madly in love with her. However I am having trouble writing such a toxic relationship in a realistic way so I am looking for some inspiration.

Therefore I am wondering whether you know of such fics where a male character is so under the thumb of his love interest that he does pretty much whatever she tells him. The condition is that the love interest be aware of her influence over the male character and use it in a malicious way. I would prefer a detailed account of how she gets to seduce him but love potions or imperius are also fine (although that seems kind of lazy writing because we don't really get to experience the male protagonist's thought process).

Edit: fixed the brackets


** I'm sensing a Harry/bellatrix or Harry/Slytherin and I'm all for it especially because this is something I've rarely seen done except for like one time in a story called well "daphne's slave" it gets really heavy quickly and was essentially abandoned after 12 chapters and wasn't the best but after that I haven't been able to get the theme out of my head

*** Maybe I used the word 'enslaved' a little loosely. Kind of like Dumbledore said that Merope enslaved Tom Riddle. I meant 'seduce' and then keeping the seduced one emotionally dependent of the seducer. I was thinking more along the lines of tropes that appear in the story of King David and Bathsheba or Macbeth and his wife.

Actually the first story I found while searching was the one you recommended but in that one Daphne is kind of good and she is only grooming Harry to be her mate or something. Also there Harry is literally enslaved without any seduction or through other mind altering means.

**** Even better in my opinion I would think a potion at the beginning something just small enough to get his attention and let's be honest harry's always just wanted to be loved and have a home and with his loyalty to a fault I don't think it would be out of range for him to go psycho rampage and then come home happy so long as the girl is there with open arms and the right words to take advantage of him

***** That's what I am going by as well but I'm trying to avoid using magical mind altering means for it. I want it to happen gradually and naturally so that the reader doesn't even notice how it happens. I mean I know in real life, the more a person gets to know us the more comfortable they feel asking stuff from us but most of us are not celebrities or influential figures enough that we can literally put the world at our lovers' feet. And that's the part where I'm getting stuck at.

****** If you plan on starting from scratch SECOND YEAR harry's isolation would make him run straight into the arms of even belletrix if she could hid her past long enough to "explain" it especially if you altered it so hermione abandons him too

******* Actually it's intended to be a canon compliant up to the Epilogue post-war story but that's a good point. Harry would still feel quite isolated being the celebrity that he is and the fact that he is the only person known to have come back from the dead could actually be overall quite bad for his mental state.

******** I could see that too, at the end of the war everyone would throw themselves at harry's feet but we know for a fact he hates this, all it would take are some pretty words that she understands him or that he hates the attention and harry would be interested even more so if she genuinely cares for him or at least appears that way

********* Thank you for your thoughts. It's been helpful. And I do intend to make the love interest genuinely care for Harry at first. It's only when she sees what he is willing to do for her that she starts pushing his limits.
