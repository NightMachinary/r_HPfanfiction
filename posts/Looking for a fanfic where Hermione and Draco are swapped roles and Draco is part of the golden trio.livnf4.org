If would be an au where hermione is in slytherin and pure blood and Draco is in gryffindor and is muggle born. Draco is part of the golden trio and hermione is the enemy/rival. If anyone knows of any fics that are similar pls recommend!!


** Would be more fun if Hermione were still Muggleborn and Draco were the Sirius of his generation, IMO.
