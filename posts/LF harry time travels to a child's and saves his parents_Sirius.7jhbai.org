Hello! Basically as the title says. We see a lot of fics where he wakes up as a baby but doesn't save his parents and/or Sirius(no time, preserve timeline, unable because he is a useless baby etc). I only remember one like that, where MOD Harry got kidnapped by voldemort who read the information from Harry's mind.

Don't care about pairings, so could be slash, femslash, gen or het. Thank you!

Edit: child's body.


** linkffn(10871795) - A Little Child Shall Lead Them, by White Squirrel is pretty much exactly this, but with Hermione doing the time travelling instead of Harry.

*** Hermione is a year older and likely would have actually been capable of rational thought and speech. Harry is very young when his parents die, but not so young that he couldn't do the same. I really liked this fic, it was cute.
