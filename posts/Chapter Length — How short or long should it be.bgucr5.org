How long do you prefer your chapters to be w/o Author notes? For me it has to be at least 3,500 words, but beyond 7-8k has me feeling like the chapter never ends. It also has a tendancy of having extraneous details or the ANs are too long. Below 3.5k tells me the author is either still a beginner (which I used to do a lot, I was so excited to have a 2.5k chapter once upon a time) or just trying to put something out. I think 5-6k is the sweet spot, but what do you guys prefer reading?


** As many words as it takes to adequaltely tell your story.

*** Agreed. Some authors have slower paces, some faster. I think different styles work well with different chapter lengths, and if an author writes it well, I don't mind a 6k+ chapter or a 2k chapter.

*** I tried doing that but then people want more purple prose and detail lol, which is something I've been cutting down on. I give the bare bones and some beige prose but other than that I let dialougue do my exposition for me.

** There isn't any real limit, but I would say at a minimum of two or three thousand words. Super short chapters can limit the immersion it is possible to get. On the other hand, chapters going more than maybe 20K words is overboard as you can easily lose your position and remove the reader satisfaction.

** My usual chapter length is about 2.5k and since I'm over 2 million words into this hobby I feel pretty comfortable calling myself ‘not a beginner.'

I tend not to want to read any fic with chapters that stretch over 3-4K. While there are certainly exceptions, I usually think longer chapters have pacing problems. Meaning they dragggggggg

** I tend to avoid fics with less than than 2k words by chapter. On the other hand 10k is readable but already a bit long and more than that, some passages will probably be a pain to read.

4-6k words seem nice for me, pretty much what Rowling used. But of course it has to be adapted to the story (I prefer to have a 3k words chapter rather than a 5k one but 2k of over detailed description wrote juste to reach the count. Same with chapter that stop at what feel like the middle of a scene without any reason but the word count.

** 2.5k+ seems about right for me. I wrote fics with 1k-1.5k chapters and they didn't get much attention compared to my current one with 3.5k average chapters. I've heard people think short chapters are indicative of poor writing.

Any less than 2k, and you probably just have a scene and should pair it with another scene or two to beef it up a bit. If you have several scenes and less than 2k words, something is probably wonky with the pacing.

I try to keep my scenes in a chapter thematically similar and just write until I've found a good stopping place.

That said, average is average. It's alright to have shorter chapters, but just know if you have too many people will judge you based on that.

** Mine are usually 2.5 - 3.5 k. Sometimes I feel like people are impatient as even in my shorter story which currently is 7 chapters (anticipating around 18) I got complains that it drags and others that say not enough. I feel like in that amount of space I get what I need to get out and usually just break it up. Sometimes when the chapters are too long and I want to reread it takes a while to find the one I want.

** Don't particularly mind the length of the chapter, but if it's structured awfully then I ususally end up skipping a lot.

Large paragraphs turn me away as well. Or just an excessive amount of issues in grammar/structure

** Within reason, as long as it needs to be.

The average length of my chapters is around 4.5k, and I put a minimum limit of 2k - because usually my scenes are around 1.2-1.5k, and depending on the content longer scenes can stand alone as a chapter. I have a limit of ~10k, because beyond that it gets too tiresome to read between breaks of other activities that readers do.

** My chapters tend to be multiple scenes, usually with a POV change for each scene, but length can vary. I would say they're rarely shorter than 3K, unless there's a real reason for it. (I had an oddball serial killer story in the NCIS fandom that had one or two short ones sprinkled in precisely because of the jarring impact.) I think my longest have been in the 11K to 15K range.

As a reader, I don't tend to notice chapter length if a fic is good, although short chapters on FF.net drive me batty because there's not the option to read straight through the way you can on AO3. (Especially true when reading on the subway with limited connectivity.)
