I recently went back and gave [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6641527/19/In-the-Realms-of-the-Opopanax][this one-shot]] (which, according to the author, may be expanded in the future) another look, and I have to say, I'm very intrigued by the concept. What if Harry decided he was just tired of all the attention that came from being the guy who defeated Voldemort and saved the world, went away into the Muggle world, adopted a new identity, and stopped using magic so that the Ministry wouldn't be able to find him?

If there are any more fics you can find that explore this possibility, please share them here. Bonus points if you find a story where Hermione runs away with Harry (since they have that whole shared background of being raised by Muggles) and they start a new life together.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7502511/1/The-Sea-King][Sea King]] is another oneshot. Probably the most recced of them that I'm aware of.

Can't remember any other good ones off the top of my head though.

*** A crossover with /Deadliest Catch/, of all things? Insane. I don't know where else I would have ever seen this.

That said, the "Harry becomes a fisherman" concept makes sense. Not having anything in the way of formal Muggle education, his career options would pretty much be limited to jobs involving manual labor.

***** I read it right after posting that comment. It was pretty much everything I was looking for. Primarily I'm a Lunarry shipper, but I'll also ship Harmony depending on the scenario, and this was an extremely good one.

I like that the surname he used for his alias was Black. It really shows how much of an influence Sirius was on his life. (Sirius - who, come to think of it, /also/ ran away from home...)

*** That was a pretty good fic, probably great for Harmony shippers. The pairing ruined it for me but for everybody else it's a good short read.

** In /Dangerous/ by Black Lotus (unfortunately down with GrangerEnchanged, but there are copies out there), Harry settles down in South America, though Hermione sticks around in England and ends up leading an uprising against the backsliding Ministry.

More generally, that strikes me as very un-Hermione. Harry we know --- he's been famous since 1, and hated every minute of it that wasn't related to Quiddich. To Hermione, though, it'd be more of a "Finally! People are actually listening when I tell them things!" reaction, IMO.

** Its not after the War but "A Squib's Worth" is a Harrry/Hermione fic were Harry is a Squib and Hermione leaves Hogwarts after the first year troll incident. Harry becomes a judge.

*** I found it here: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4771879/1/A-Squib-Worth]])

It was interesting, although I think I liked "The Sea King" better.

  The day Harry Potter turned eleven was the day he would have re-entered the magical world. But the letter never came; Harry Potter was a Squib. Dismissed by the wizards, he makes a quiet life for himself and will not stand for them to ruin it.
