There's a Harry/Fleur, good!Ron, Harry!runaway post almost once every three days. Before making a post, consider searching for your question on the sub first. Chances are, someone's asked the SAME question before.


** One could argue this in itself is a repost. We get this type of PSA post pretty often as well. Usually I don't mind the reposts, since there's usually a fic recommended that either I haven't heard of, or I forgot about and never saved to my reading list.

Honestly, I'll take reposts all the time as long as this sub stays active and healthy. I overall really like everyone's positive responses and patience with newbies who come on here asking for a post-war fic.

*** Additionally, some of the original posts are already so old that they are archived, so it's not possible to add anything to them if there happens to exist a decent story that fits the criteria of the request and did not exist at the time of the original post.

** It's ok to request something that has been requested before, as long as there has been a reasonable amount of time (more the 6 months at least). After all, new stories are written all the time. In this case, linking the previous thread not only encourages people to give you /new/ stories, but reduces the chance of pissing people off who think you're just being lazy.

** To be somewhat fair not counting the more common requests I know I've searched for something and the latest thread was over a year ago, even a few months and there could be new stuff. Besides it isn't like people posted all the fics under criterion x the first time.

That said people really should search first, especially because it's honestly faster than waiting on replies. It's a win win really person finds their fics quickly and the sub doesn't get drowned in the same common requests.

** I can't say it really annoys me but it's a bit repetitive. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect people to read the first page! At the moment /on the first page alone/, there are three threads looking for crossovers (two of which seem to be asking exactly the same thing) and two about nanowrimo (also exactly the same).

** Except that, according to the more outspoken members of the sub, if you want runaway!Harry without H/Hr or without H/G, or would prefer slash, or no romance, that means a brand new thread. Since there are a hundred different flavours of pairings, that means we get a hundred variations of runaway!Harry.

** I got aggressively crapped on when I posted the same. Last week I think there were at least three requests for a time travel story, which is a pretty typical week. Don't be surprised if you get some mean-spirited responses.

**** I wasn't keeping count, all I can tell you is that they are similar requests really, and could be covered easily in a single post. As long as we all understand that it's likely that so many similar posts are going to exasperate the regulars to the point where they may lash out or simply ignore them, carry on...
