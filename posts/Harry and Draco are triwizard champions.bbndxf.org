I can only remember the second task where Draco has a boat that can go underwater. Any help is appreciated!


** Is Draco obviously cheating? Because I vaguely remember a story where he was entered and was obviously cheating through the whole thing (can't remember why)

  This started as a short story about how nerd weaponizes light. Now it is 'how quickly can we cover the entire Harry Potter series while adding progressively more technology and research into the mix.' Still a stupid story for the sake of stupid stories, though. Enjoy
