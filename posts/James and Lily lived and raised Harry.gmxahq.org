Absolutely NO Wrong Boy/Girl Who Lived BS going on here, James and Lily surviving and raising Harry as loving parents is what I want.

Maybe Pettigrew wasn't the Secret Keeper, maybe they realized he was a spy, maybe they managed to escape while Voldemort got to their house, or a number of other variety.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual (Doesn't have to focus on a pairing).

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can have any warnings.

Would rather have good Weasley's and good Dumbledore. I can handle bashing of Dumbledore, but I don't want Weasley bashing.

No OP Harry, Harry being smarter or more powerful then in canon is fine, but I'd like for it to be realistic. No Godlike powers, no inheiritance powers or anything like that.

It can be a story of Harry traveling to an AU or time travel and making it happen, or just the story itself taking an AU turn, eiher way is fine.

Horcruxes can or doesn't have to be a thing. I don't care either way.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.

  Mr. and Mrs. Potter were not perfectly ordinary people. They did not live on an ordinary street like you or I. They did not have a small house with a number to differentiate it from the identical houses on either side of it. They had, in fact, quite the opposite of it all.----How different would the world of Harry Potter be if James and Lily had lived? Ships not listed because I'm unsure if there will be deviations from canon in that respect. Characters will be added as they appear.

  Sirius Black remained the Secret Keeper and everything he feared came to pass. Ten years later, James and Lily live, Harry attends Hogwarts, and Voldemort remains...yet the world is different and nothing is as it seems. A Marauders-centric fic originally posted on FFN, now updated and edited for AO3.

  What if Voldemort had chosen the pureblood boy, not the halfblood, as his opponent? This Neville would have had graves to visit, instead of a hospital. He'd still have grown up in his grandmother's clutches, tut-tutted at, dropped out windows absentmindedly, left to bounce on paving stones.Let's tell this story: Alice Longbottom, who was the better at hexing, told Frank to take Neville and run.
