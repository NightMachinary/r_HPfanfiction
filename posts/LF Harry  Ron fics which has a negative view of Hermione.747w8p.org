There are a lot of fanfictions which has Harry and Hermione as the main characters and bashes Ron, and I really want to see the inverse of this, which bashes Hermione rather than Ron. Though, the fanfiction does not actually need to bash Hermione, rather have a negative view of her.

Note: I've read all the works of Marietsy2 which fulfils my request, so please don't suggest those.

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)

*** I loved the original. I like the revised version. Except for [[/spoiler][the bit where he just straight up murders Umbridge and no one cares]].

**** I'm more disturbed by the fact that they didn't raid Voldemort's hideout immediately. It would be so much easier to knock out the big bad in his weak homunculus form than trying to maintain that questionable timeline.

** The one I can think of right now is "Sekrit Project" by Chilord. It's one of my "guilty pleasure" fics, really... trying to sum it up makes it sound awful, but it's actually pretty fun.

In their fourth year, after some shenanigans at the Quidditch World Cup, Harry and Ron -- along with Slytherin girl Tracey Davis -- end up on an official committee to think up new additional challenges for the upcoming Triwizard Tournament.

The second plot thread is a prank gone wrong, a prank that involves an experimental potion and a sabotage-happy Draco Malfoy -- and which ends up turning all the Slytherin students, male and female, into incredibly hot girls.

Told you it sounds like an awful fic when you try to sum it up.

But... well, it's well-written and often quite funny (the first couple of chapters are a little tedious, but once the Weasleys enter the story ithe quality improves vastly), and you have to give gredit to a fic that manages to turn Ron into a Potions prodigy and make it believeable and in-character.

As for Hermione... I wouldn't say she's BASHED exactly, but she's definitely a lot more negatively portrayed than what's usual.

The Hermione in this fic is essentially Hermione as she was in the earliest parts of the first book, pre-character development: She's haughty, bossy, arrogant, extremely narrow-minded, and the world's hugest stickler for rules. She spends much of the fic at odds with Harry and Ron because she disapproves of their actions... and because she doesn't like Tracey, who strikes up a friendship with the boys. (She's probably a little jealous too.)

Her treatment is fairly mild compared to a lot of character-bashing fics out there, mind; at least you get to see where she's coming from, and it's made clear that she DOES mean well; she just can't fathom why the boys would not want to do as she says when she clearly knows best.
