I'm looking for a fanfic where a priest finds a de-aged Harry who had been tortured. The priest thinks that Harry has stigmata because all his scars keep reopening and ends up naming him Adam. I read it on ao3 about four months ago I think, but I can't find it anymore.


** I've never read it but I am already so interested in it.
