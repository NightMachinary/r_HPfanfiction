I'm hoping that people could recommend me a few fics where Harry ends up ruling the roost at Privet Drive before getting his letter..

â€‹

I remember reading one, several years ago.. Sadly it turned out to just be a plot device to have an 8 year old kid dominate and bone Aunt Petunia.. Has anyone actually done a story where Harry ends up not getting slapped around by all three Dursleys?

*** This might be the best Indy!Harry fic I've ever read. Sure there's tropes like magical cores, Dark/Light families and Wizengamot politics but it's never so bad that I wanted to stop reading. Nobody is bashed (except maybe the Dursleys), everyone has good reasons for acting the way they're acting. Throughout much of the fic the usual mad-old-coot Dumbledore tropes start showing up but the narrative always promises that Dumbledore is doing things for a good reason and then one chapter is a Dumbledore POV and it explains everything so well.

It even does Powerful!Harry right, he's stronger than most adults but Voldemort and Dumbledore could still flatten him if they were getting serious.

The author wrote everything up to 6th year and just stopped. Such a tragedy.

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.
