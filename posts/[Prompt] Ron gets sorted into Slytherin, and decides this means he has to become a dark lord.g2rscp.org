Except, due to circumstances beyond his control, although his plans succeed, they always end up making things better.

Set a troll loose on the school? It runs into another troll that also got loosed on the school and they knock each other out.

Set a classroom on fire? It reveals the secret Hogwarts treasure vaults that have been lost to the school for centuries.

Kill the defence professor? You've saved the school from Voldemort.

Destroy your sisters diary in front of her with cursed fire? It was evil and possessing her. Also you saved the school from Voldemort. Again.


** I think there was one like this except with tonks as the Mc

  ONE SHOT- When Tonks was six she discovered that there hadn't been a Dark Lady since Le Fey, she decides to become the Dark Lady Tonks. But there's a problem; every time she tries to do something evil, she ends up being a hero. Shout out to Chaos Shadow Kitsune for this idea- HONKS
