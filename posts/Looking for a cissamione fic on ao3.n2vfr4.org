:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I am looking to find a cissamione fic I read sometime in the last few years. I am reasonably sure it was on ao3. It was about Narcissa helping as a healer in the immediate aftermath of the battle of Hogwarts. She and Hermione helped people in the castle. I think it was a one-shot? LMK if yall have heard of this or remember it

#+begin_quote
  Four years following the war Hermione can finally move forward with her research, Shadowing a healer at St mungos seems like the best place to start. When she discovers the healer is in fact Narcissa Malfoy, perhaps Hermione's initial optimism was misplaced, or perhaps not....
