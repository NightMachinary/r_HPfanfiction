:END:
I remember reading this female self insert work that was pretty short - only a few chapters. About an older student (a few years before Harry arrives) who's pretty intelligent but overall doesn't put any effort into socializing or changing the canon plot. She observes Harry arrive and sees him behave incredibly OOC, coming to the accurate conclusion that Harry is also a SI who clearly reads too much fanon (thinking he knows how magic works and boasting about it only to fail). She calls him out on it super quiet like (just between him and her saying something like "you're so bad at being Harry Potter", at which point his eyes boggle and he freaks out a bit). She also communicates with her eyes a lot - as in Professor Snape seems to be able to translate how open/closed her eyes are into what her mood is (e.g barely open = gives no fucks). Does this ring any bells for anyone? I'm pretty sure it was on AO3, but it might have been FFN.


** No idea, but I love the idea of an SI looking at the main character and realizing "oh no, it's some dumbass who's forgotten canon"

#+begin_quote
  A collection of plot-bunnies from various fandoms that I'm mostly putting here for my own reference, but figured maybe one or two might get an intrigue out of a person. If someone happens to see one they want to adopt, though, feel free to ask me about it. Some of them I plan to continue, but most of them are just ideas that aren't all that fleshed out yet.Any crossovers will be marked as such in the chapter titles.Fair warning, some of these cut off in weird places, because they aren't at a realistic stopping point yet.Tags and fandoms will be updated as works are posted.
