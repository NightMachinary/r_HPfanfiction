** Linkffn(Havoc Side of the Force) Harry ends up in the Star Wars galaxy around the time of The Phantom Menace. The language barrier is an issue, and allows for the introduction of everyone's favorite droid, HK-47. (SW has a parseltongue-like language.) And the interaction between magic and the Force provides a great deal of the conflict. He also unintentionally defenestrates most of Palpatine's plans.

Similarly linkffn(I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For) the lack of a language barrier is a plot point, and Harry's disdain for the Jedi provides a lot of character development among the cast.

  I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.

** It should generally be a curb stomp when HP magic faces off medieval Muggles such as in the Land of Ice and Fire. The little bit magic present there wouldn't be able to compete with the high powered HP magic. In addition, some HP wizards like Hermione were also armed with knowledge about modern Muggle technologies.

I personally like a good curb stomp from time to time, especially if it is directed against those filthy Muggles in the GoT world. IMO, everyone there could die and I wouldn't give a damn. Daenerys and Jon Snow were only slightly better than the rest of the scums. So “Legend of the Gryphon”, linkffn(12195136), is quite enjoyable to read, although it's still getting shipping heavy in the 2nd half. Unfortunately, I've yet to find a good GoT crossover that tries to turn that shit hole into a modern industrialized constitutional democracy.

I find LOTR is surprisingly balanced vs HP. Although HP magic would slaughter orc and goblin armies easily (Fiendfyre), I doubt it would be very effective vs non-human bosses such as the Balrog, Smaug, Saruman, and Sauron. The One Ring was basically a different implementation of the Horcrux, and the line between good and evil was very cleanly drawn. Steelbadger is IMO by far the best writer for that universe, but he/she prefers the 'loner Harry' approach and which basically leads to Harry being assimilated in that world. I personally prefer more balanced representation of characters from BOTH worlds. “Failsafe”, linkffn(11281891), would have been my favorite HP/LOTR crossover if it was ever finished.

** Not exactly what you're looking for, especially since it's about characters from elsewhere in Harry Potter, but this fic is basically entirely about the magic and culture clash aspects- some magical, some muggle (due to the nature of magicians in the crossover world). Entertaining enough if you like Type-Moon linkffn(9340220)

** Hmm the 'madness' series by ZenoNoKyuubi might fit the bill. The first one, linkffn(In the Mind of a Scientist by ZenoNoKyuubi) is purely a HP fanfiction, where Harry approaches magic from the perspective of a mad scientist. The sequel moves into Stargate and the third one goes to Mass effect. It follows Canon loosely but magic is definitely not nerfed, and it's less about culture clash and more Harry doesn't care about culture at all. Harry definitely gives a fuck it all vibe.

  Harry Potter wasn't raised like in canon. He was top of his class, and very intelligent, always seeking to improve things, and so he learned all kinds of things, and, upon entering Hogwarts, started studying all he could get his hands on!
