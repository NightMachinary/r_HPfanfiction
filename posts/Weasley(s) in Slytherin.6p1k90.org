The thread I posted last night eventually gave me an idea.

Looking for stories where a Weasley(or multiple Weasleys) are sorted into Slytherin. I've already read most of the good Slytherin!Ginny stories.


** Ron time travels and ends up sorted into Slytherin in linkffn(the red knight). It's an interesting story and premise but some parts are executed poorly. Overall it's pretty good.

I want to see a decent Slytherin Percy.

  AU: Slytherin House is no longer the house of Merlin, but of Voldemort. Two ambitious people, Percy Weasley, first Slytherin in the family, and Gemma Farley decide that this should change to help them on their path to greatness.

Does the Magic ever become better? I remember it explicitly went through details of every motion that someone used to cast a spell but then whenever it was Dumbledore that cast a spell, we conveniently skip over that. I genuinely hate going through the motions, and even saying a new incantation in general, but it's inconsistent.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
