** My favorite longer Trio fic is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][Forging the Sword]] by Myst Shadow.

#+begin_quote
  ::Year 2 Divergence:: What does it take, to reshape a child? And if reshaped, what then is formed? Down in the Chamber, a choice is made. (Harry's Gryffindor traits were always so much scarier than other peoples'.)
#+end_quote

It's a WIP but still being updated, if somewhat slowly. Currently at 150k words.

**** Is there a reason other than the pairing you would give against the story?

Sounds interesting.

***** I think the pairings were the main point of pain for me. The only stories I really like are the H/G ones.

There was something about the writing that turned me off a little. It just gave me an overall gloomy sort of feeling that is hard to explain. It was still good enough that I got through about 80% of the story before I decided I just couldn't anymore. YMMV.

** If you're good with the silver trio rather than the golden trio, Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness is a really fantastic one about what happened back at hogwarts while Harry, Hermione, and Ron are out searching for horcruxes. It focuses on Neville, and it really fleshes out how he went from the Neville before DH, to the Neville who stands up to Voldemort. It's really true to character, and it also fleshes out many other characters like Ginny and Hannah Abbot.

** What do you mean by Trio-fic? I'm kind of confused, the only time I've ever heard that phrase is when people are talking about Harry/Hermione/Ron threesome ships.

Am I wrong here?

*** Henestpy just good grammar, coherency, length and being finished. When I'm on ff.net I always sort for length and completeness.

**** Sometimes you should switch it up to '60k' or '100k' word count instead of 'complete', imo, because otherwise you're missing out on some brilliant WIP's. Just my .02 though.

****** Yeah, I hear ya'. To combat this, I sort by 'update date' as well, and only go back maybe 2 or 3 months so I know it's still actively being added to.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8233288/1/Faery-Heroes][Faery Heroes]] was a nice story by Silently Watches. Harry/Hermione/Luna. It does have a lot of dumbledore, Molly, Ron, and Ginny bashing through.
