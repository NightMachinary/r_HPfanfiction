**** I think the problem is that it doesn't lend itself easily to a vignette, you need to develop a full story, which is a big ask for a reddit comment thread. Getting the prompt across in a single scene is... tricky. Someone might be whacked with the inspiration stick, you never know. Or you'll find a twelve-chapter fic on AO3 six months from now.

*** It's an original, interesting idea that subverts the fandom cliches.

It won't exist until it's written, and then it'll spawn hundreds of imitators that slowly tarnish the novelty of the original.

** Arthur laughed 'soon I shall take Harry potters money and then I shall learn the function of a rubber duck' he started to laugh evilly.

"dad, could you stop evilly plotting against all of my friends'' ron complained as he entered the lounge room.

"Yeah dad, I am with ron on this one' said one of the twins, which one is not important anyway " its rather annoying, me and the other twin are lucky lee Jordan likes spiders because otherwise you mailing thousands of spiders to him would have ended our friendship''

"I do not plot against the friends of my children' arthur tried to argue. "dad, I went for a sleep over at luna's house and then a week later her house exploded' Ginny the female weasley responded. ''I had nothing to do with that one sadly' Arthur replied with a sigh. 'why cant you plot against someone like malfoy' ron suggested. "dont be crazy ron, Why would I plot against the malfoys, while me and Lucius might have a back and forth he tries to get the female weasley expelled and I raid his house in return to make him pay a fine, we get on quite well, so why would I ruin our little back and forth' arthur responded. Ginny grew red 'DAD I ALMOST DIED DUE TO THAT DIARY" 'yes and Lucius was completely devastated he only wanted you expelled not dead, he was quite distraught over the whole affair, his emotional outburst was quite unmalfoy like and almost ruined our sunday brunch' arthur smiled softly 'but thankful his little clone was home for the holidays and he was quite eager to continue the friendly feud between our family's' arthur paused to collect his thoughts 'speaking of which, good work my son that is friends with that potter boy, Malfoy the clone, mentioned you a few times its nice to know you are doing your job as a weasley right'

*** Imagine Arthur being obsessed with muggles because he fears they are dangerous.. for the completely wrong reasons. Guns? Bombs? Bah! Decoys all. The most dangerous muggle artifacts are those we do not understand.. such as the Rubber Duck or Piggy Bank! For the safety of my family, I must interrogate any muggles I meet.

*** It isn't! OP is asking for an Arthur Bashing story that follows standard Molly Bashing tropes. For example, being convinced that Harry's sole purpose in life is to marry Ginny and Harry's thoughts on the matter being null and void, with possibly some marriage contract shenanigans.

Or, overheard conversations between, in this case, Arthur and Dumbledore plotting how best to divest Harry of his wealth or even see him killed and get the loot. Or get Ginny the loot.

Stuff like that.
