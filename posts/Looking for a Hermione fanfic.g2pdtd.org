:END:
Hii, I'm looking for a Hermione fanfic I read a long time ago. What I remember is that Voldemort won the war and because of population rates being to low muggleborns were brainwashed and given new identities, though Hermione doesn't forget her true identity. Hermione, for some reason I don't remember, becomes Voldemort's right hand and tortures Ron? Yeah, something like that. She also spares Blaise bc he decided to date/marry a muggle. Then she invites Draco over for tea and he drugs her and takes her to the order bc he's a spy. I don't remember what happened after and I haven't been able to find this fanfic anywhere. If you know this fanfic pls link it, I would really really appreciate!
