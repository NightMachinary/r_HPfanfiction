I've only managed to find one or two good lotr crossover fics, looking for more


** Some of these are technically Hobbit crossovers, but I'm going to assume that's close enough.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Elves Most Fabulous by Steelbadger) is a goofy crackfic about Harry getting sent to Middle Earth as an elf child and causing chaos and generally annoying everyone around him.

linkffn(The Unlikely Visitor by Quantumphysica) Sauron gets dropped into the Harry Potter world and has to learn to play nice.

linkffn(Five Istari and Four Warlocks by darienqmk) is mostly crack and general weirdness about an overpowered and immortal Harry, Ron, Fleur, and Katie exploring Middle Earth and causing a bit of chaos for about 1000 years. They finally reached the start of the Hobbit in the most recent chapter, but it hasn't updated since February.

linkffn(A Fate Touched in Middle Earth by Vimesenthusiast) is about Harry tagging along in The Hobbit. Updates are slow and irregular, but they're also large and they do happen.

linkffn(Incendio by savya398) Harry is actually Smaug's son.

linkffn(Steady is the Hand by rhosinthorn) is about an OC with some vague similarities (and even that is being generous) to Harry who follows Aragorn around like a puppy and has no real affect on anything in the story. It's good until you realize that Holly is pointless and nothing will ever change from canon. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, unless you just want to read an abridged version of LotR from an uninteresting perspective. But maybe someone will enjoy it more than I did.

And here are a few fics that I've read, but have basically no recollection of. They were apparently good enough for me to complete, but my standards may have been lower back then. linkffn(The Power He Knows Not by Steelbadger) linkffn(The Vanquisher by AJ Freas) linkffn(There and Beyond by SciFiFantasyWriter1)

  Elfling!Harry. Except not. Jaded and cynical Master Auror Harry Potter gets sent to Arda to relive his non-existent childhood. Childhood sucks. Rated M for language.

  Thrown into the Void as a bodiless fëa, Sauron hadn't expected to get out there any time soon. No wonder thus that suddenly crashing stark naked into a different world came as a bit of a surprise... Will he cope with the wizarding world, Hogwarts, and the messy Weasley family, or are we in for disaster? Either way, it's gonna be a rough ride...

  A decade ago Harry Potter found himself in a beautiful and pristine land. After giving up hope of finding his friends he settled upon the wide plains below the mountains. Peaceful years pass before a Ranger brings an army to his door and he feels compelled once again to fight. Perhaps there is more to be found here than solitude alone. Harry/Éowyn.

  After the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter helped with the rebuilding and then went back to school, sitting his NEWTS and graduating with the rest of what The Daily Prophet called ‘The Disrupted Class.' Following that, everyone expected him to become an auror. Harry himself expected it, right up until the moment came to apply to the academy.He takes up a hobby instead, and it leads him to a whole new world.

  Fifth year, Harry's been banished into a painting by the despicable Umbridge. Now he has to find a way back home, and the only way he can do that, is by finding the scattered jewels of the Wizard's Crown. Can his new-found friends help him, or will being with them end his life and chances of ever getting home? Based more on the LOTR movies than the LOTR books.
