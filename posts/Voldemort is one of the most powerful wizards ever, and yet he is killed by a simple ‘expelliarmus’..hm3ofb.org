** I think that was kind of the point. Voldemort built himself up as this invincible monster that was above everyone else. He didn't gain respect, he inspired fear. So much in fact, that many fear even speaking his name.

After the trio took away his horcruxes he was mortal once again and equal to everyone (except for skill). It's supposed to show that in the end he wasn't some superior being, but a living, breathing human who can be killed.

Harry even calls him out on it during their battle by calling him by his given name instead of the name he chose to fashion his immortal persona.

*** It is still unsatisfying that you can win a wand by proxy. Taking someone wand, fine, makes sense. But Malfoy never held the Elder Wand, at which point "finders, keepers" makes more sense tbh. And on top of that, just because Harry took one wand from Malfoy, it shouldn't take all wands since again, Harry never took them, only the one he stole. Having that as the reason why Harry won feels very forced.

**** Well, I think the point is Voldemort never won the allegiance of the wand. Since Draco disarmed Dumbledore, Draco did. And somehow, the Elder wand "sensed" Draco's wand in Harry, so it switched since it was better than Voldemort? It's a bit out there, but I guess that's magic for you. It didn't "like" Voldemort so it switched to an alternative.

Perhaps the fact that Voldemort lost to a simple Expelliarmus may be due to the wand never accepting him. Maybe like the one ring purposefully losing itself from an owner it doesn't want, in an agenda to get back to Sauron (LoTR).

****** Eh, if the wand would abandon it's own creator, the eldest Peverell, we can safely think that it cares little for bloodline and mostly for power. Perhaps it realized its master's waning magic due to the destruction of all of his Horcruxes and was simply abandoning the sinking ship?

** Voldemort's defeat at this point was a foregone conclusion; Harry is immune to Voldemort's magic from the moment he returns from "King's Cross":

#+begin_quote
  "You see?" screeched Voldemort over the tumult. "Harry Potter is dead by my hand, and no man alive can threaten me now! Watch! Crucio!"

  Harry had been expecting it, knew his body would not be allowed to remain unsullied upon the forest floor; it must be subjected to humiliation to prove Voldemort's victory. He was lifted into the air, and it took all his determination to remain limp, *yet the pain he expected did not come*. He was thrown once, twice, three times into the air. His glasses flew off and he felt his wand slide a little beneath his robes, but he kept himself floppy and lifeless, and when he fell no ground for the last time, the clearing echoed with jeers and shrieks of laughter.
#+end_quote

Incidentally, he's also immune to Dementors:

#+begin_quote
  And now a chill settled over them where they sood, and Harry heard the rasping breath of the dementors that patrolled the other trees. They would not affect him now. The fact of his own survival burned inside him, a talisman against them, as though his father's stag kept guardian in his heart.

**** I don't think anyone has ever asked JKR about that point specifically. It could be something as prosaic as Voldemort using the Elder Wand of which Harry is the master. Or it could be something rather more profound arising either out of Harry himself or the nature of the events he is a part of - certain of JKR's comments about magic more generally may suggest that magic in the HP universe favours the morally righteous when it comes to momentous events.

***** Harry being its master makes little sense in the first place since Malfoy never held it and Harry never won the elder wand, he only took Malfoy's regular wand. That kind of proxy transfer is highly unsatisfying.

As for the morality of magic, if that was the case, Voldemort would not have gotten as far as he did. Giving magic that kind of morality opens up Theodicy, but with magic.

****** Just as the cloak of invisibility is different from other cloaks, the wand is different. The wand changes allegiances if its master is defeated.

Edit: "The secret of the elder wand is that it's more sentient than any other. It can identify the caster of any spell that touches it and keeps tally of which wizard has beaten which, giving its allegiance to the one it judges the victor. Physical possession is irrelevant." -JKR's twitter

I'm not one to care for JKR's Twitter revisionism and commentary, but she'd said it's more sentient than other wands back in 2007.

** If you've lasted that long without being disappointed, I am surprised you actually were when it happened. You'd have had much time to get used to Rowling's special brand of anticlimax. After all, both Voldemort and Tom Riddle were portrayed as not just powerful, but also extremely skilled wizards. We catch glimpses of that in Dumbledore's trip down memory lane and during the ministry duel... But at all the other times he appears to be an Unforgivable-slinging simpleton. Such a waste of a good villain...

** I think I'll offer the opposite response to everyone else. This was such an upset for me as a teen. I'd dreamt of and read hundreds of fanfics where Harry kills Voldemort in a whirlwind of fire and combat, only for DH to arrive and Rowling make him to die scared and alone in the forest and then she just deux ex machinas him the win because she couldn't think of anything better.

I still haven't forgiven her for the let down, but I've come to terms with it. Harry Potter is just not that kind of story, and Rowling never intended it to be. It wouldn't have fit with the narrative for Harry to end it in a blaze of glory.

What a shame. That's what fanfiction is there for i guess.
