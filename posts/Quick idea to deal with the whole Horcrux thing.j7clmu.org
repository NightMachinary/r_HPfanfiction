It's applicability would depend on how you are building your world, but assuming that the resurrection stone needs to have considerable power to drag a soul back from the afterlife and the only reason it can't drag a soul from a living person is that the bond between body and soul can only be cut through the body dying, then it could potentially be used to summon all the soul pieces of an earthbound spirit despite the enchantments keeping the soul-pieces bound into objects, and once the soul was separated from the objects the soul should move into the afterlife after being dismissed.

Could even be applicable to the piece in Harry since it technically isn't bound into his body, just along for the ride. Voldemort's principal soul would really be the author's choice, technically his body died and he bound himself into the new one with magic, meaning that it should be just as powerful a bond as an Horcrux's, on the other hand his is the only soul into an organic autonomy body, so maybe the bond formed is stronger -as I said, could go either way.


** dumbledore would have done it if he could.

*** Probably, for all we knew he could not have understood enough the stone to try it, thought that calling Voldemort's soul was to dangerous for some reason or just plainly didn't have the idea -The stone /is/ regarded more about dealing with grief or speaking with loved ones; Dumbledore was suffering from a powerful curse at that time, under stress of leading the war effort, trying to find the other Horcruxes /and/ was too involved with the stone's primary objective to see much else, it is perfectly possible that such an out of the way use just didn't come to him, he is human after all he has the right to make the occasional mistake.

Plus, if it would work or not is really just up to any author who decides to try it, this is just a possible plot-device neither confirmed nor denied by cannon, it would really only depend on how an author wants to do the world building.
