#+TITLE: Suggestion: Delicate by padfoot4ever. Next Gen fic about Rose Weasley getting pregnant at school. Astoundingly good, not just for the premise, it's one of the best written rice out there imo.

** /Delicate/ wasn't my cup of tea (more of an issue with romanticized pregnancy in this fic genre) but the writing is great, and there's a finished sequel as well. HPFF is the place to go for romance-drama-humor of this quality; many trends were born here, and /Delicate/ defined the pregnant Rose fic.

** I've found that many people are turned off by the cliched premise. But seriously, you should read it. The quality of writing is superb and the author fleshes out the next gen characters beautifully. It's the most popular fic on HPFF and that's for a very good reason. Wholeheartedly second this fic and its sequel Still Delicate.

** Yeah, it a scorpions knocks up rose fic but it's really, really well done. More comparable to Juno than any other fic out there.
