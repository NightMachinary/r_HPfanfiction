Hey everyone! Just wanted know if somebody could recommend a few tomarry/harrymort fanfics. It`s incredibly hard to find good ones and it can be in any website. Thanks a lot!

What Souls are Made Of by Emeralds_and_lilies

A time travel where Harry, Hermione, and Ron all get pulled back in time. It's somewhat newer but I think all the characters are well written especially Tom and it updates every week.

** There is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/13059681/chapters/29871909][A Dangerous Game]] by Cybrid. It's still in progress (and rather punctual in it's update). Basically, it starts with the Chamber of Secret where Harry arrives too late and lured by Tom himself. He killed the girl (not Ginny; probably Daphne or one of the other background Slytherin girls) and while he tries to kill Harry, they destroy the chamber. They both try to escape. Tom basically kidnaps Harry. I find it both fun and full of suspense. It's rather well written and the characters are really fleshed out (and Tom isn't some cheap version of himself and Harry is still himself, not some Dark version of it).

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/17632187/chapters/41574056][God of Nothing]] by Machiavelli (They also wrote Field Theory, with a Slytherin Harry). In an AU where they grow up together at the Orphanage, with no magic, they have to go through the rough reality of the times and the war. It's just beautiful (and violent). A Tom who instead of becoming a Dark Lord is sent to war and become a vicious soldier (I suddenly forgot the exact title/rank in English).

Anything written by [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/Luxis][Luxis]] .

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/12061266/chapters/27315231][Aconitum]] . A flower shop au. It's not a pretty cute story but it's Tom. And it's beautifully written.

It goes well with the other flower shop au: [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7769080][Don't Fuck With Florists]] .

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3885466/chapters/8687344][Thé Perfect Murder]]

Thé [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/1160693][Lightning]] series.

Édit: i somehow forgot about Strange Soulmates! [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7035334/chapters/16006603][Good Intentions]] which is a totally AU with no magic and Harry's family being alive. James is a cop, Tom is still a psychopath and Harry is young and cute. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6015619/chapters/13804801][As Certain Dark Things Are to be Loved]] where they were childhood friends and reconnect at uni. It's also an AU without magic but Tom is still Tom: he's got his Death Eaters, is a version of his own Hogwarts' prefect self and Harry has lived through Sirius being wrongfully accused, Quirrell, Draco, the Dursley's, etc.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6985795/1/Xerosis]]) is a bit cracky but still good with emotion and plot

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/Again-and-Again]]) is very good and has a couple explicit scenes, the author marks the sex scenes so you can skip them

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

** I don't know if you're still looking for some, but I have two that made me laugh.

$30 for 8 oz by ShippingAllShips

Internet sensation Tom Riddle, now selling his bath water to his adoring fans! Harry is so done.

It's really short, but I enjoyed it.

Something New. by Nerexx

People have been beginning to lose interest in internet sensation Tom Riddle. That's where Harry get's dragged in.\\
Tom is basically the Belle Delphine in this world

This fic was inspired by $30 for 8 oz, and it's how I found it. The last chapter is coming out tomorrow. Again, it's short, but good read in my opinion.
