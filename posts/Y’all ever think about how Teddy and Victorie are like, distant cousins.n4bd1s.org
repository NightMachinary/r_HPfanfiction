** Less than four degrees of consanguinity is a problem. Pretty much everywhere in the world other than a couple of states in the US (who prohibit four or less degrees rather than three or less degrees) agree.

Teddy and Victoire - who have six or seven degrees of consanguinity - are perfectly fine to marry. There is no problem here.

** eh, that's distant enough to not cause problems and the wizarding world seems to think second cousins is far enough. Not to mention some pureblood supremacists who were okay with first cousins. Harry and Ginny would also be similarly related.

** Teddy and Victoire are fourth cousins once removed (Victoire's g3-grandfather is Teddy's g4-grandfather: Phineus Nigelius Black).

*** Same. Like I found out while at school that I had about 4 cousins in my grade alone because they were like 2nd and 3rd and 4th cousins that none of us talked to. Absolutely loathed anytime somebody asked if I thought they were cute.

** They aren't much more related than people in any small, preindustrial village were. Inbreeding can cause big problems if done to excess, but people really overstate how risky it is. A population can even get away with a first cousin marriage or two every once in a while, with only a few percent increase in birth defects in that couple's kids.

Anyway, I don't think this is as big a deal as you think it is.

** They are distant cousins to such a degree of distance that I kind of see more of a problem with actually keeping track of it and considering them related than with them hooking up, marrying, making babies, etc. Granted, I see zero problem with them doing that, so...

** All humans are related if you look back far enough. Teddy and Victoire are so distantly related, it doesn't matter.
