:END:
I remember reading about Rowena Ravenclaw being reborn as Hermione Granger and Salazar Slytherin being reborn as Ron Weasley. Harry is Godric. I forgot who Helga was. They basically made something while drunk and then drank it so they were reborn. I remember that Ron had to go to St Mungos because Salazar being reborn into his body made him seem like an obscurus. It was because Salazar did a lot of Dark Magic in his life and Ron's child body couldn't handle it.


** I think the fic you are looking for is Coming home by Moonwitch96

** That's a new one on me. The one fic I remember reading that had the founders reborn had Harry as Salazar, Hermione as Helga, Neville as Godric, and Luna as Rowena. The fic was called Rebirth of the Founders by DaSalvatore

**** Just remembered something is the fic you are looking for one where Ron is the heir of the "good" son of salazar? Eg a Weasley secret is that the are descendants of Slytherin but that the "title" goes to the youngest son?

***** Nope, I remembered something about Ron being pranked when he was still a kid by Fred and George. It was because of the stressful situation that it made Salazar reborn.

I think it only has a few chapters written but it's still updating I think.

But if you could link the fic you were talking about. It would be much appreciated :D

  The Founders found a way of putting powerful safeguards into their bloodlines. Now, as Harry faces off against the shade of Tom Riddle and the basilisk inside the Chamber of Secrets, the Sorting Hat causes one of those safeguards to activate. The result means Harry Potter is now Salazar Slytherin and the most misunderstood Founder is the Boy-Who-Lived.

** This isn't one I've heard of, but if you're on a founders-reborn kick, there's one where Salazar Slytherin is reborn as Hermione! linkffn(10991501)

It's a bit over-the-top (as you'd expect from the premise), but it's pretty entertaining and the author has been updating very regularly!
