Hey everyone-

I've been looking for a couple of dramione fics by Colubrina that were deleted a couple months back. One is “the ones who ran” and the other I forget the title but it was a Theo/Hermione post-war AU.

I've already checked lostdhrfics tumblr

Bonus points for anyone who knows where to find the spin-off to Draconian by hepburnettes


** If you search ‘epubs' on my tumblr you'll see the link for the dropbox and both The Ones Who Ran and Stalwart and True are in there.

** Just ask her on her tumblr, there's links there for her Dropbox Lostdhrfics should have Draconian but I didn't know there was a spin off :o

** Her ffn.net profile says she's removed some stories for personal reasons and asks people not to share them. If you can't find it, maybe just get in touch with her on tumblr or twitter to ask her directly but otherwise just respect her wishes.
