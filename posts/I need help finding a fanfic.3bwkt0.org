Hey

I hope you can help me find a fic for me

I do not remember a whole lot from it as its been a while since I read it. But what i remember is that Harry didnt go home to his relatives but changed into a dog and stayed on the Hogwarts express. When the train then arrived at hogwarts again he then proceeded to jump off hurting himself in the fall. Somehow he managed to get to Hogwarts where he was found by Severus Snape. And Severus named harry animagus form something beginning with A

Thats all I remember. As I couldnt find it myself, Im trying here

Hope you can help me
