:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a fic I read a long time ago. Basically it's a marriage law fix the couple's are Draco/Hermione Harry/Daphne and Ron/Tracey. I believe it either starts or ends with the golden trio giving a interview 20 discussing that the law went into effect 20 years ago. Thanks


** The flair you should be using is 'What's that fic?', not 'Request'.
