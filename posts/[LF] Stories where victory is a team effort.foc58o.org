The fact that JK's story had Harry isolated post GoF, and that all Dumbledore did with Harry was Riddle lessons, followed by the camping trip, leading into Harry walking to his death and coming out on top afterwards kinda bugged me..

Could you recommend stories where Voldemort and/or Dumbledore get beaten due to multiple people pooling their knowledge, skills and resources to come out victorious?


** I know of one but I cant remember the name. Basically Luna gives harry and hermione therapy and it helps them get together along with including Luna and I think padma patil in the relationship.

** i'd strongly recommend the Arithmancer series here. Hermione is very OP and does a lot, but so does everyone else and it's a cool look into the characters fighting as a team.

*** I love the Arithmancer, but it does feel a bit like Hermione does almost all of the work. This story has many great aspects but balanced effort isn't one. I honestly can't remember anything important Ron did.

**** you know, now that i've just finished rereading it, i agree with you. i was thinking about the ritual aspects, but Harry and Ginny didn't do as much as i remembered they did.

** Linkffn(Divided and Entwined)

Voldemort has enough political power through his followers for a quasi legal takeover. Civil War breaks out with a handful of different factions fighting each other. The Order, the Resistance, the French group, the Avengers (not the marvel ones, no crossover), the Ministry aurors, the Death Eaters, and the Jamaican voodoo wizards. It's complete chaos but Voldemort's defeat is a massive team effort between most of the groups.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
