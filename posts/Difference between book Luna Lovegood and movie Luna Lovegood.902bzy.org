** Luna's one of the most faithfully- represented characters in the movies both in looks and mannerisms. The biggest change is that Movie-Luna seems to be better groomed; the book version had scraggly and dirty-blonde hair, while the movie version has regular blonde hair that's not particularly scraggly... this is hardly the first time someone's hair has been prettied up for the movies, though.

Book-Luna also seems to be slightly less serene, or at least she has more moments where she isn't. She's a little quicker to show annoyance... especially towards Hermione, whom she regards as narrow-minded. When she finds something funny she laughs HYSTERICALLY at it; At one point she laughs so hard at Ron's not-very-funny joke that the others start wondering if something's wrong with her.

Other than that's it's generally small things that are either hinted to be different in one version, or just not mentioned. Like, the books never specifically mention that Luna has an Irish accent; in fact since she lives and grew up in Devon it's more likely that she doesn't... but it never specifically says she DOESN'T have an Irish accent either. The books never address her liking for pudding, but again they don't say she DOESN'T like pudding. And of course in the movies, Luna never once mentions the Crumple-Horned Snorkack.

Compared to Ron, Hermione and even Harry, though. Luna has made the transition from page to screen with very few real changes. There's a reason why even fans who don't like the movies much will still praise Evanna Lynch's portrayal of Luna... she pretty much nails the character.

*** Also as a small annoyance I see a lot.. "Pudding" is more likely to refer to Dessert, rather than the weird Yoghurt-y thing Americans have. She likely just has a very general sweet tooth (from the movies) rather than being a fiend for Vanilla/Chocolate pudding

**** I love how this thread started out as a conversation about Luna Lovegood and thanks to this one comment, it turned into a debate about pudding instead.

**** I know the British use of "pudding"... but Michael Goldenberg, who wrote the script for OotP is American... as is Steve Kloves, who wrote the scripts for all the other movies. The characters of the movies often have a certain American turn of phrase and wording even though the actors are mostly Brits...

So I'm pretty sure Michael Goldenberg, when writing "pudding," meant it by the American definition. ^_^*

**** There is nothing yogurt like about pudding, nor anything weird about it, it's mousse which is a perfectly normal dessert. A French confection, but Brits more than anyone who injected French cuisine into American taste by being enormed with all things French culture during the 19th Century.

***** I mean it comes in the little yoghurt pot things, and you eat it with a spoon? I was also of the understanding it was more liquid than mousse?

****** This is funny. There was a big to-do that hit the British press recently about Yorkshire puddings, so if you're looking for compromise on this controversial (/s) topic you aren't likely to get it. But to me your likening the texture of pudding to a thick yoghurt makes perfect sense.

******* Which would demonstrate (again) that Americans do in fact have their own culture, and culinary history. As that article pointedly indicates, what the NYT was reporting on was a Dutch Baby pastry, a completely different (though not wholly disimilar) confection.

******* If your custard (American pudding) has gone mousse-like it's been overcooked, it should be like a thick smooth cream.

******** Custard/Mousse, regardless my point was that American style pudding isn't like yogurt. And in America pudding always refers to a dessert, where in fact pudding in Britain does not always refer to a dessert because there are in fact several savory pudding dishes in British cuisine that are almost never (if ever) made in America.

Pudding is much thicker, and the texture is completely different. Sour cream would also be something that pudding isn't like either.

My main objection is the snide insulting tone.

********* But American pudding does have a texture similar to sour cream, thick yoghurt and snot. If you search for "pudding cup" on walmart's webpage you'll get an image American pudding. Other than that I agree with you.

** New post title - Pudding: Please explain

I love Luna though, both book and movie. (Unlike Movie Ginny, who is a simpering idiot. Book Ginny is much more badass.)
