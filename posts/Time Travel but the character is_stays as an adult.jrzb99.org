A lot of time travel I've read seems to have the character become younger then they are. But it'd be interesting to see a focus of adult character x being surrounded by other adult characters.

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can be on any length. Can be older or newer.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine.

Would rather NOT have Weasley bashing.

Note: Would be interesting to see the adult main character trying to ignore the kid version of themselves. Though if they interact somehow that'd be interesting too!

Would rather not have people find out that they're a time traveler, but if they do find out I'd rather wait a bit into the story. Though that's not mandatory.

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes/etc.


** The Second String fits the bill, it's adult Harry being sent back in time to the 1970s during the early days of the first WW.

It's also a slash pairing (don't want to say who with though in case you're sensitive to spoilers).

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in the past, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. Some slash much later.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

** This distinction is why I separate do-over aka "Peggy Sue" fics (character somehow in their younger body) from "time travel" (character's current body in a different time).

Harry rescues his infant self in A Brand New Start by Fawem. Eventual Harry/Sirius, which is not my cup of tea but it's at the end and not explicit, and the rest of the story is really good. linkao3(15375369)

The most unique time-travel story I've ever read is The Young Adventurer's Club by Artemisgirl. Everybody in the fic is 17: the group travels to different years to pick up everybody when they are 17. The pairing is one that takes a lot of flak because of the age gap, but in this story there IS no gap. linkffn(9993319)

A Jaunt Through Time by Nia River is cracktastic, wherein adult Harry announces himself by capturing fake-Moody in the Great Hall, and refers to his younger self as "runty-Harry" (until they come to an agreement). linkffn(9191701)

Escaping the Paradox by Meri Oddities and Tapestry of Fate by Minxie both have an adult Harry going back in time (one deliberate, one not), where he tries to give student Snape a better life. linkao3(2060; 10140137)

The absolute best time-travel, in my opinion, is Of a Linear Circle by flamethrower. It's super-long and still in progress. Harry/Snape but no age gap because of the time travel. The series also includes Founders' histories that you can skip if you want, but they're brilliant stories that enrich the main storyline. linkao3(11284494)

To Shape and Change by Blueowl is a mentor!Snape story, where Snape is the time-traveller. linkffn(6413108)

  Rita spouting lies, branded as a Dark wizard and goblins in a rage; Harry's had enough. So, he seeks to jump back in time to save himself from a life of misery and fickle loyalty, maybe a little revenge and mysteries along the way. Time Travel! A Harry raises himself fic.

  COMPLETE. The odds of temporal displacement were tiny, too infinitesimal to count, and yet... The Harry Potter luck striking again, he supposed. So now there's an older, wiser, more mature Harry (well, the older part's true at least) stuck in the past. And he's determined that if he's going to change things, he'll have some fun doing it. (OR: Time travel minus angst equals this.)

  Thrown back in time from 2019 to 1991, a grown and disgruntled Harry Potter finally has the chance to change his life for the better, fixing things before everything went wrong and becoming the father figure for his younger self that he never had. Changing time is difficult though, and the more changes he makes, the less predictable the world turns out to be. Though now maybe he actually has a chance at happiness, both for him and his younger self, and just maybe a chance at romance as well.

** Well you can try the story HP: Dolen Amser by Jonn Wolfe. It's a Harry/Tonks story where via spell interaction Harry ends up going back in time to his first year but the original Harry is still there. So this older Harry is not allowed (swears on his Magic) to change the time line because of dangers of creating a paradox. Of course, that is easier said then done.

  Thirty-Four year old Harry Potter travels back in time, adopting the name of Blake Slytherin - he interferes with his own trial and messes with Dumbledore's perfectly laid plans. What happens afterwards? will Blake have bitten off more than he can chew? Will it be left to Harry to do what needs to be done? SLASH HP/FW/GW BS/SS NO MPREG
