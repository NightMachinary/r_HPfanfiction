I thought it might be nice to have a discussion about HP fanfic you'd like to see, but haven't found yet!

I think this is a cool idea for two reasons: 1) someone might know about such a fanfic & could direct you to something you'd really like to read! 2) Or else, it might inspire someone to write something, which is always good.

I'd personally like to see just a restructured Philosopher's (Sorcerer's) Stone, that has the same characters and general conclusion, but just plays out differently!


** Harry and Voldemort kill each other simultaneously, resulting in Voldemort's permanent death and a slightly different kings cross station - harry chooses to go back, but due to circumstances (the way they both died, or the shared blood thing) ends up revived in Voldemort's body instead of his own.

Cue harry dealing with the existential bullshit of witnessing his own corpse while being trapped in Voldemort's body as everyone around him is screaming. Clearly this leads to how he becomes a weird hermit gardener/anonymous author out in the countryside that never goes into town and the resulting disaster shenanigans. He'd bet his life this was tom riddle's secret ultimate final revenge plan.

**** I've read a few Voldemort/Harry body swap fics, though they pick up in fifth year instead of at the battle of Hogwarts.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10490069/1/Of-Kings-Of-Pawns-and-Of-Men][Of Kings, Of Pawns, and Of Men]] - 12 chapters, in progress. In my opinion, has some very well written character interaction. linkffn(10490069)

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5118649/1/Becoming][Becoming]] - 26 chapters, dead. Has an interesting(?) take on Dark magic addiction as Harry struggles to keep his cover while leading the Death Eaters. The story is marred by some squicky slash in my opinion. linkffn(5118649)

  Harry wakes to find that his soul/consciousness is now in Tom Riddle's body. And the Dark Lord? He's doing an unfortunately good job of impersonating the Boy-Who-Lived. Dumbledore's disappeared, and Voldemort doesn't hesitate to let Harry know that he makes a weak replacement for the leader of his opposition. So: naturally, Harry has no choice but to prove him wrong.

****** A Mother In Law's Love has the absolute best crack version of the Goblin cliche I've ever seen.

#+begin_quote
  I took the documents and concluded our meeting with the customary Goblin platitude, "Thank you, Skullrutter. May thy coffers fill with thine enemies' fingerbones and daughters' dowries."

  Skullrutter grinned, exposing rows of dark, serrated teeth, his face lit up at finding a client apprised of Goblin custom. "And you, Harry Potter, may thine heir's dagger blood itself first not in thy back, but in thine enemy's."

  I made a fist with my right hand and pounded it heavily upon his desk. "And may thine enemies tremble before thee. And may their wives break their hips from thine own powerful pelvic thrusts!"

  Skullrutter stood, eyes wide, and leered at me. "And may the life blood of thine enemies flow in champagne fountains at thine exclusive Country Club during the wedding reception of thy first born daughter!"

  I leaped upon the desk and roared, "And may thy chiropractor learn his weirding ways from a gentle and at least moderately competent instructor! And may he keep his fingernails trimmed!" I kicked the Goblin hard in the face, splitting his lip.

  He staggered to his feet, spit blood upon the floor, and flourished a blackened scimitar. "And may thy love interest keep an open mind in the bedroom!" He swatted me hard on the left shin with the flat of the blade. "And may he or she swallow when called upon!" He struck the other shin.

  I withstood his blows with quiet stoicism--Goblin etiquette is not so much about the words exchanged as one's composure; to make a sound would be the gravest of insults. We glared at one another in silence for several seconds, then relaxed.

  "Good day then." I stepped down.

  "Good day to you, Mr. Potter. And Happy Birthday."

  Give them credit--Goblins don't get much work done, but they have a hell of a lot of fun doing it.

** A fanfiction that shows us the adventures of the Order of the Phoenix and just how utterly awesome they are, with all the adventures and missions they go on. Could be a big gigantic duel against Voldemort and his Death Eaters or just their daily life as a spy or how they manage to balance their work with the Order's.

I feel like they're all very underappreciated and they just have so much potential as characters. I mean you can get very creative with them. Why did Voldemort kill Dorcas Meadowes personally? Was she just as old as Flamel without her secret uncovered? Was she just that much of a threat? Or was she the longest lasting spy before Snape and she was found out? Or was it kind of a symbolism for the Order because she was just such a ball of sunshine and hope and he wanted to demolish that for them? There are a lot more of them to work with but they're very underrated and underused. Which I think is a shame, since I found them very interesting.

*** This has to be AU though. Canon Dumbledore and Order got their asses thoroughly kicked by Voldemort, losing like 40% of their people, while hardly putting any notable Death Eaters permanently out of business (only Rosier and Wilkes came to mind).

Dumbledore and Order were far more effective and deadlier in [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]], but Death Eaters and their Ministry sympathizers vastly outnumbered them.

Major canon stations still exist, but details often greatly differ.

Hogwarts is an elite spy school. The Weasleys become the Wellesleys, Purebloods become the European aristocracy, and Riddle's goals become the aristocratic totalitarian rule and overthrow of the British democracy.

This changed setting significantly affects the Trio's character development, as they have been trained from very early on to become cunning and ruthless intelligence operatives. Harry, in author's own words, is an extremely dangerous young man.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** I have so many ideas:

1. MoD!Harry, after being cursed to be ageless and remain eternally alive when he inadvertently united the Hallows, is sick of his inhuman life and wants it all to end. However, he cannot die. As a last ditch effort, he creates a plan: travel back in time. Not to his childhood, but too the 1970s. What's his endgame? Kill James and Lily as 5th year students. In other words, Harry is the terminator traveling back in time to prevent his own birth and end his own cursed life.
2. 4th/5th/6th/7th year Harry, realizing he needs to get his shit together, discovers a way to use his invisibility cloak (or whatever) to travel between parallel dimensions. He wants to become strong enough to protect his friends and loved ones, and live up to his parents sacrifice. The catch? This is a crossover fic of Harry Potter...and Harry Potter fanfiction. An ultimate meta-crossover where Harry travels to the worlds of other popular fanfics to learn new skills/powers/magics/knowledge from alternate versions of himself. Picture canon!Harry meeting Harry from A Black Comedy, and somehow they get wrapped up in trying to break into a purebloods house while Harry learns how to use the magic arms (spoiler). THINK of the possibilities here!
3. Talented Hufflepuff!Harry. The draw is that, Harry, who always wanted to appear normal and blend in, would hide his talent and ability as he grew, so it was a shock when the TWT rolled around and he could hold his own in the contest.
4. A believable re-do of canon (or parts) where the reasoning for Harry's infatuation with Ginny is made clearer. None of that BS about a chest monster and random love potion scents. I feel like this is something that would be really obvious for a lot of people, but most of the time their is a significant or even massive change in canon to do this which is not what I mean.

Someone would have to reveal that information, which only harry would know, so it's kind of a moot point anyway. One plausible way though would be Snape, who finds Voldemort and begs his aid in exchange for his eternal servitude.

*** Regarding #4, I've read some fics where Harry & Ginny's feelings grew organically out of them both having experienced a connection to Tom Riddle's soul, though they didn't realize it. In some cases it was just a bonding experience (shared trauma from the same psycho) or Riddle's soul subtly infected their personalities so they see a bit of themselves in each other. In other fics, their feelings grew from the life debt in 2nd year.

Either of these explanations would fit logically with events in the books. Do you consider those options to be massive divergences from canon?

** Trying to distinguish this from just listing out plot bunnies by speaking about more general ideas, not specific fic plans.

*No war series*

A series where there were no horcruxes and Voldemort died for good in 1981, though he still transfers some of his powers to Harry.

The focus of the series would be more lighthearted, more in the tradition of the boarding school genre, but still with an annual adventure/mystery. It would all be about exploring Hogwarts and the mysteries contiained within it.

*Historical stories*

I'd be interested to read about wizards in interesting historical periods. In particular:

- The era of colonial empires and wizards' involvement, or lack thereof, in it. British India would be especially interesting.

- Ancient Rome, which of course pre-dates the statute of secrecy. Two words: wizard gladiators.

*Sci-fi*

"Wizards in space" with a twist. What most people do with this idea is position the achievement of space colonisation/exploration and heavy industrialisation as unambiguously good, with the enlightened space-going Muggles outstripping the parochial wizards.

I would like to see a more reflective/contemplative type of wizarding sci-fi, where magic still holds it own against technology (the wizards are still comfortably hidden, for example). Not because magic has developed to gain a sci-fi character of its own, but simply because the fundamental supernatural nature of magic means that technology, based on natural forces, is unable to overcome or subvert it.

In this story, the expansionist, resource-consuming Muggle civilisation would be contrasted with the more ecological wizarding one. Ironically, even though Muggles' power derives from mastery of nature, the possession of unnatural powers means that wizards are able to live an existence much more in tune with nature than Muggles. The story would explore the unseen clash of civilisations, as wizards seek to preserve Earth (while maintaining secrecy) as Muggles increasingly view it as an expendable resource to launch a space-faring civilisation.

It wouldn't be a whitewash, however. The above makes it sound like the intention is to portray technology as unambiguously bad, and that is not the intention. Wizards are judging Muggles from a position of privilege: thanks to magic, they can enjoy all the comforts of a high quality of life without having to damage the natural world, and as a community with a small, stable population they do not have overcrowding concerns. Muggles do not have that luxury. In many ways, the damage the Muggles do to the environment is the wizards' own fault for failing to share the fruits of magic with the Muggles. So the story would also be about the pros and cons of the statute of secrecy, an issue which the wizarding world has considered taboo since Grindelwald.

A believeable Tom Riddle/Luna Lovegood (currently trying my own hand on that one).

** -The Deluminator, which I've yet to see as much as mentioned in fanfictions much less made central to one. Being able to overhear what people are saying about you is incredibly powerful, especially to someone as important as Dumbledore.

-Slytherin!Percy - I've only found a very few, and I'd love a longer/deeper exploration of his character development along a different direction.

-An interesting exploration of Merfolk and their society/customs.

-A balanced Star Wars crossover, where neither world is inherently insanely overpowered over the other. (Darth Marrs' stuff is the closest I've seen, but it's not quite what I'm after.)

** For me, I've always wanted to read:

1. An AU set after or around 6th year where Hermione ends up spying for the Order of the Phoenix by somehow infiltrating the Death Eaters. Could be that she's secretly a pureblood, that she takes on someone else's identity, or otherwise convinces Voldemort to let her join. It'd be great to see something that focused both on the dark/gritty nature of spying and also the impact would have on Hermione and Snape's relationship.

2. In a similar vein, I'd love to see a muggle spy AU, similar to [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] but with more of Kingsmen/secret agent vibe

A scenario could be based on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/3mw3b4/hermione_and_bellatrix_as_a_teenager/][this premise]]:

The Order raided Bellatrix‘s home a few weeks after she gave birth to a daughter, whom she treasured above everything else. She and her husband weren't at home that night however, and the Order didn't have the heart to kill an innocent child. So they burnt down the house, took away the child, and eventually found a muggle woman looking somewhat similar to the young Bellatrix. With some magic, the Grangers were happy to become a family of three.

Bellatrix, on the other hand, completely lost it, and began her descent into bloodlust, madness, and sadism. Whereas she was a tough and lethal, but a disciplined warrior who abstained from torture before, she now completely gave herself into the dark arts and Voldemort's cause. Later, she learnt that the leader of the Order during that raid was one Frank Longbottom.

Much of the story went as in canon, until the Battle of DoM. Here, Bellatrix chased down and subdued Hermione. She then stripped Hermione naked and was about to humiliate/torture her, but saw the very mark she had placed on her daughter all these years ago. She recovered much of her sanity immediately and had a emotional talk with Hermione. Bellatrix would take no further actions in the battle, and Sirius survived as a result.

Bellatrix's good mood and changed behaviors were soon noticed by Voldemort, and she explained that Potter's best friend was her daughter and their cause would be greatly helped if she could bring her over. Voldemort then asked Draco what he thought of Hermione. Draco answered that Hermione significantly bested him throughout the years and he didn't think a Mudblood could have done it. Now he was actually happy and relieved that he was beaten by his very own cousin. Voldemort then gave Bellatrix and Draco the task of turning Hermione.

Hermione struggled a long time with this revelation. She was deeply worried that Bellatrix might attack her adoptive parents at any time, so she persuaded them to take a vacation to outside of the country. There, she modified their memories and sent them off to Australia. Soon after returning home, Bellatrix indeed showed up to kill the Grangers. Although she didn't accomplish that, she was nevertheless impressed by Hermione's ruthlessness and ability to cast complex charms at such young age. A longer talk ensued...

**** Hermione being Bellatrix's daughter would be interesting. Though, the mark is a bit too cliche-I think either Bellatrix works it out by tracking her down. Or one of the Order lets it slip.

I reckon that Bellatrix falls for a muggle as well-its anti-canon but it would be interesting, rather than her husband.

**** I've considered writing something with a similar premise to this, but currently am a bit swamped with stuff to write! Anyway, my premise was as follows:

The tale begins in October of 1981. Bellatrix and Rodolphus have two children: Cassiopeia, who is two, and Leo, who is six months old. On one of the nights that the Lestranges are out on Voldemort's business, their house is raided by a team of Aurors led by Frank Longbottom. Leo dies, and Cassiopeia escapes by a miraculous feat of accidental magic. Bellatrix comes home and swears revenge on Frank Longbottom and his family for killing her son. She knows that she'll likely be killed or captured, so she takes Cassiopeia and apparates to Spinner's End. She begs Snape to take care of her daughter, and he protests mightily until she points out that she doesn't trust him, but she trusts him more than some of the other Death Eaters. Besides, Snape is the only one who has enough skill with mind magic to perform a highly sophisticated Obliviate spell so that Bellatrix will believe her daughter also died in the attack.

Bellatrix, Rodolphus, and Rabastan go off to attack the Longbottoms, and end up captured and sent to Azkaban. Shortly after, the Dark Lord vanishes. Snape is left a child who very obviously is the daughter of Bellatrix and Rodolphus, and not wanting to risk being sent to Azkaban himself, Snape uses a Polyjuice potion derivative on the girl after finding a Muggle woman who has similar looks to Bellatrix. Snape's potion changes fewer features than actual Polyjuice, and as a result it lasts much longer. Snape does some quick mental manipulation of the Muggle woman and her husband, and leaves Cassiopeia with them. The couple, who couldn't have children themselves, are delighted with their daughter, and name her Hermione.

To keep his work secret, Snape revises the Potions curriculum to remove any ancestry potions. This works well until Dumbledore hires Slughorn, who doesn't know Snape's secret. Ancestry potions get put back on the curriculum, since they are very fiddly and good for NEWT students to brew. Hermione ends up brewing one in class, and is shocked by the revelations it provides. This leads to a conversation with Dumbledore and Snape, and they conspire a way to turn Hermione Granger into Cassiopeia Lestrange and thereby give them another spy in Voldemort's ranks....

2. A Harry/Hermione story where they get together without overthinking the whole thing, declarations of undying love or grand acts straight out of a romance movie. Would it be too much to ask for one fic where on a random Tuesday, Harry or Hermione have the urge to kiss the other, act on it and then just see where things go instead of already planning the wedding before their first date?

3. More stories like "Blue Magic", where someone from another universe, preferably Mass Effect but baggers can't be choosers, stumbles across Harry and raises him. Not the average Sirius/Snape/Lupin raise Harry fic, but more like a blue, monogendered alien with the ability to flay people with their minds despite being outstandingly kind raising Harry on Mars. Or Seven of Nine being thrown through time and space and finding herself oddly attached to the small child left on the doormat.

4. Crossovers where someone is dropped in the HP universe and fucks Voldemort hard enough to get the recording uploaded to Pornhub. Imagine the Master Chief jumping out of the Veil during the DoM battle, Vader bringing the Executor to bear on Malfoy Manor or Shepard, Garrus and Wrex turing the Battle of Hogwarts into a turkey shoot.

I have this idea that all Weasleys except Ginny died in the Final Battle. Completely disillusioned and disappointed with the postwar Ministry, Harry left Magical Britain with her and Hermione. Teddy and Andromeda also joined them. Twenty years later, they would return to cleanse Magical Britain once and for all.

It just might take a bit more thought than “I don't like Ron, so he's gone now”. If we remove a character, especially a key one like any of the trio, then we have to think about what that means for whoever is left. For example, if we ditch Ron...he's saved Harry's life in DH, when there was no one else around to do it. So how do we avoid killing Harry in that bit?

Yeah there are definitely obstacles but I think, critically (and I probably should have said this before), in a fanfic without Ron I wouldn't expect it to follow the narrative to such an extent that individual scenes would be an issue ... so much would have to change if you removed him that I'm not sure it would be possible, and I think the whole point (in my mind) of removing Ron is seeing how it moulds the story into something different.

Also I would love to read a fanfic that is a self insert except the self insert is NOT a good hearted person who wants to help save the world, but will instead either be a chaotic neutral with their own agenda, or would go over and help Voldemort's side and then all the Order characters would be confused about why a "good guy character" just suddenly switched sides. :) I mean imagine a sadistic, selfish self-insert Dumbledore or Sirius switching sides randomly! And in this story I could imagine them using their self insert knowledge of all the books as leverage to secure a high position with Voldemort. Like, pass themself off as a seer or something. Voldemort would not want to waste someone with invaluable omniscient knowledge like that.

I'd also love to see the OPPOSITE: a self-insert who's a good person who ends up in the body of Voldemort or one his Death Eaters, and then she jumps ship and goes to the Order and tells them she wants to switch sides or just stop fighting, and then maybe you'd get a "bad guy" fighting for the good guys scenario?
