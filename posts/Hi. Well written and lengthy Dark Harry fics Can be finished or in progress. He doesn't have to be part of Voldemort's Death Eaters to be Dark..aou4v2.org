Trying to find some of the Dark Harry stories I read back when reading fanfic was a hobby. Looking for well written(cliches are fine if they're written in well) and lengthy Dark Harry fics. He doesn't have to be part of Voldemort's army, he could lead his own group or something.

Thanks!


** I'm pretty sure none of these are ones you're looking for, but they're the ones I've read/am reading and either enjoyed or haven't forgotten.

linkffn(Antithesis by Oceanbreeze7) is a popular and new WBWL! fic which is just...it's good. I've reread it twice now, and it only finished this last October. In it, Harry and Skylar are twins, and Skylar is mistakenly thought to be the BWL, et cetera, et cetera---you know the story. Harry is, of course, sent to live with the Dursleys after a few years. However, things take a turn for the worst when /they/ send Harry to live at an orphanage, where he is found and adopted by some not-so-nice people. Bittersweet ending with an emphasis on bitter---like dark chocolate. Hints of Luna/Harry sprinkled in

If you want some /really messed up/ dark!Harry fics, there's linkffn(Harry Potter and the Homecoming) which is the first in a six-part series. It gets /incredibly/ dark and is not for the faint of heart. I'm usually pretty good with dealing with this sort of thing, but *I couldn't finish the last book*. DON'T go into this expecting a heroic Harry. The main pairing is Daphne/Harry, if I remember right. First couple books aren't written very well, but the quality of the writing, at least, gets better over time, even if the characters themselves slowly make worse and worse decisions

linkffn(The Last Enemy by Luolang) is an amazing oneshot where Harry returns to the Forbidden Forest and finds the Resurrection Stone; he was doomed from the start. Not long, but well-written and good for the occasional reread. It's a favourite of mine that I desperately wish was longer

Besides that, there's linkffn(Death of Today by Epic Solemnity) which is one I'm currently reading. It takes place in an Alternate Universe where the MC, Izar, is genius prodigy who is slowly being seduced over to the Dark Side by a politician by the name of Tom Marvolo Riddle. As far as I can tell, Izar is a new character who took Harry's spot---this bugged me at first, but I'm used to it now. So far, it's been a good read if you want something a bit different, though be warned for slash if that's not your cup of tea.

There's a couple of others I've read, but they weren't really that memorable. Hopefully you enjoy at least one of these

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long.
