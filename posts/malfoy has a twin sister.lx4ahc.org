** Hah!

At first, Malfoy's twin dislikes Harry as much as he does. Over time, however, he begins to see that his sister is developing a love/hate relationship with Potter that slowly shifts to more love than hate.

And it looks to be mutual, much his and Ron and Hermione's shared horror.

It comes to a boiling point where, in later years, she pulls an Andromeda and sides with Harry against a returned Voldemort and, by extension, her family.

Meanwhile Draco is stuck being an unwilling and traumatized Death Eater, per canon, until he openly betrays Voldemort during the Battle of Hogwarts to side with his sister and Harry, and to save their parents in the process.

It either ends with genuine remorse, as in canon, or where he tragically dies saving her and Harry's lives.

**** Oh, sorry if I gave the impression it was a story: I was spitballing an idea based on the request (I admit I missed the 'Request' part of your post -- I thought it said 'Prompt'. I need to sleep more!).

****** I'm kinda surprised something like this hasn't been written already, to be honest. Then again, most people who are a fan of Malfoy's character just ship him with Harry in slash, so... I dunno.
