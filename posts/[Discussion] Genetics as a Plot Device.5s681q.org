So, many people in the fanfic community enjoy finding little holes in the canon, and then increasing the uniqueness of their stories by patching these holes, and providing in depth explainations. So I have been turning over this theory in my head, and it makes enough sense that I wanted to see your opinions.

Genetics doesn't work in the Magical World. DNA is not functional, biologically in all magical beings or creatures. Bear with me, bio students, and move through your outrage. Magic does things intuitively, the way someone might think that they would be done, but not really the reality. That is why logic and science aren't useful with Magic, since the latter makes the former simply stop working. If DNA and genetics aren't functional for magical organisms, it actually explains a lot. Magic itself acts as the method of inheritance, and does not corrupt or mess up in the same way that DNA might. That is why despite the low population, and rampant inbreeding, we never see any confirmed effects of inbreeding, with an acknowledged exception in the form of the Gaunt family. What magic does for inheritance, is it actively selects the best traits from both parents, invalidating natural selection to an extent. Of course, the disfunctional DNA still affects the body, making it slight less able, but magic is able to correct for it within reason. But when you get a half-blood, they have the optimal body traits from the muggle DNA, and the optimized magical traits from magic, explaining pretty readily just why Voldemort, Snape and Harry were more powerful than a lot of other wizards.

It also explains part of the issues with breeding and diversity in the magical world. Why on earth would a Goblin or Giant be able to breed with a human. For that matter, why would a fire crab as a crab, and a manticore as a psuedo lion creature be able to breed, creating Blast Ended Skrewts. Inbreeding, and even cross-species breeding can be corrected for because magic still takes the best traits, without randomization. One could probably throw in something about centaurs being created when a Wizard and a Horse had dubious relations, which in itself would cast the Wizard-Centaur diplomatic relations in a different and weird light. But not only that, but if the most optimal traits are picked each time, albeit with a small amount of chance, it would explain the lack of genetic diversity so to speak in the Wizarding World. You get only a couple insects, a couple types of diseases because random mutations don't affect the organism or offspring unless it is carried by magic.

Thoughts? Opinions? Horrified outcries at such a sick mind to conceive of such things? Throw them in. Because despite everything, there are rigidly defined issues with the Wizarding World. The crossbreeding, and the lack of genetic diversity.


** My head canon has always said inheritance has magical aspects. Ever wonder why Draco and Harry look like clones of their fathers? In my mind magic responds to the subconscious wishes of the parents. Perhaps squibs or ugliness is a reflection on the relationship between the parents more than anything. Prominent family traits dominate in the wizarding world, people can work out which family you're from just by your appearance, I'm no genetics expert but I'd have thought there would be more variation.

** If magic always selects for the best traits, why aren't all magical beings, and especially wizards, superhumans by this point? I mean, they'd all be super-genius Adonises with every talent under the sun.

Unless, of course, the pureblood ideology was right, that mudbloods weaken the wizarding bloodlines.

That'd be interesting, wouldn't it? Hermione would go absolutely batshit if it was undeniably true.

*** It makes sense from a certain standpoint. Let's look at Hagrid. While woefully uneducated, he is perfectly capable of doing magic. Maybe not to the extent as others, but he is decent enough given his education. He also is massive, strong enough to wrestle giants, and is spell resistant close to on par with other giants. Maybe what happens is that the more mangled the DNA is from inbreeding, the more magic is required to correct for it. Magically, the pure bloods are all stronger than Muggleborns, but are limited by the damage to their bodies from interbreeding. So when half-bloods like Riddle pop up, they are ridiculously powerful, because their magic was developed to superhuman levels, but their magic didn't have to correct for nearly as much. Though, maybe it isn't 100% of optimal traits passed along. Maybe more like 75%, making the pure blood obsession make sense, but continual breeding with muggleborns will dilute the magical traits.

** Blacks are insane, due to inbreeding. Gaunts are freaks, due to inbreeding. Weasleys are soulless gingers, due to inbreeding. Potters have untameable hair, due to inbreeding. Filch is a squib, due to inbreeding. Albus is gay, due to inbreeding. Draco is a hairless ferret, due to inbreeding. Joane kelly is a croaky voiced goddess, due to inbreeding. Tonks is clumsy, due to inbreeding.

You could take every little element in series and explain it away due to pureblood marriage practices.

If genetics didn't work, no one would be born for a zygote wouldn't be formed by two haploid gametes fusing. Magic MIGHT have some way of countering some issues but genetics still take place, otherwise they'd all look like freakangels most likely instead of harry looking lile his parents and ron being soulless.
