Sirius stares in horror At the smoking Pyre That was once Godric's Hollow, a stronghold of the Potter estate. He heard Desperate cries Of anguish and agony Emanating from the flames as those still trapped with the black smoked struggled in vane. At Sirius' feet Lily Potter Slumped , Clutching her baby while James ran Every diagnostic spell he could think off on both of them . The villagers They had managed to save at the fled the fallout of the Disaster meandered around them. Some desperately trying to Smother the blaze while others Recognizing The Family Hell Fire Stood in Grief stricken silence as Their loved ones screamed for help as the Raging inferno Slowly swallowed them.

Sirius had arrived just as the wards around Godric's Hallow were breached, as James faced down Voldemort unarmed, his wand 30 feet behind him on the sofa. Sirius Did something he never thought he would when he saw The man he considered a brother Staring death in the face. Sirius called Something he had learned from his mother, Walburga A woman so mad she made a pact with a demon to Bolster her power, A pact she had Gleefully passed down to her children a macabre sort of Inheritance, Walburga Passed on the Ability Drag forth The fury of hell it's self and Unleash it on the earth, A skill she had played dearly for, One that Sirius Refuse to touch with a 10 foot pole Until it was almost to late . With his loved ones On the precipice of death, Sirius Finally accepted his curse Inheritance and burned Voldemort And everything within a 3 mile radius to the ground. As the Dark Lord Began to scream In surprised agony. Sirius dragged James, Lily, And anyone else he could find Out of the path of the ever increasing Inferno.

Sirius had saved the Potter's lives But not without bringing darkness into his soul. Sirius had done something That made him sick to his stomach but Would have made his mother glow with pride.
