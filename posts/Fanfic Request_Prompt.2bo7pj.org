Just a Harry Potter fanfic prompt with angst and family themes.

In the summer before Harry's third year, he accidentally inflated his aunt. A response team from the Ministry arrived to deflate her and modify her memories.

What if, while doing that, they decided to check the rest of the family for curses as well and found strong compulsion charms. Charms that would drive them to hate magic and one particular person to the point of irrationality. And the spells were removed.

The Dursleys shouldn't stop being... well... /themselves/. Some of their flaws are not related to Harry in any way. But their behavior toward Harry should change drastically. There should be a lot of guilt on their end.

And Harry shouldn't just accept it right away. He would be on edge and suspicious about the whole thing.

Attention should be paid to where events lie in the Harry Potter timeline. They should show some concern for what is happening to Harry throughout the school year.

I would prefer if Dumbledore was innocent of cursing the Dursleys. Blame the Death Eaters or someone in the Ministry who's trying to discredit Dumbledore.


** Extra points if it /wasn't/ Dumbledore who placed the compulsions.

** I really hope someone picks this up. It sounds like it could be the beginning of a really good fanfic.

Here's the problem: this is way too late into the timeline to make a difference. Apart from Dudley's scene in canon being a bit earlier, what the hell's going to change??

At that point in time his relatives play no part in the story anymore, them being sorry wouldn't matter at all.

*** They didn't play a part in the series because they didn't care about what was happening to Harry. Now they would have a reason to care. The effect would be small, but a smart fanfic writer would be able to think of ways to make them more important.

Small examples: Dursleys coming to watch the Third Task. The champion's family was invited, after all. The Dursleys being witnesses for Harry at his trial in the fifth book. Just in general them being more supportive of Harry after Cedric and Sirius die, leading to potentially fewer of the emotional issues that characterized the fifth book.

It seems like a very small change, but it can be used in interesting ways. Besides, what I wanted was mostly the family drama, not to change the HP world drastically.
