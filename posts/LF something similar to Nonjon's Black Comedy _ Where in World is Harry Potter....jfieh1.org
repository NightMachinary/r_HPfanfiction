As the title says I am looking for something similar amusing to read with a decent length. So mainly focused on the Humor Part.

It doesn't have to be post Hogwarts but otherwise I'd prefer it was more unique similar to 7th Horcrux for example.

I feel like I have either read anything the search function threw at me in the past or didn't like the recommendations :)


** Gods, how did I forget the title of the one with Mr. Black and the Doctor????

I'm ashamed of myself.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...
