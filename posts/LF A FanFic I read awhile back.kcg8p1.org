:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey all. LF a fanfic I read awhile back. I can't remember who was shipped with Harry but I remember a phrase that goes something like “ who ever decides to date Harry will have to share him with Hermione.” Or “anytime she (Hermione) calls he's gonna come running.


** I am not familiar with this fic, but the proper flair for this is "What's that fic?"

** I've seen a couple like that but the one that jumps to mind is one of Clell65619's "The Marriage Contracts" stories. He's got 2 versions of it and I'm linking the revision: linkffn(5835213). Harry/Daphne.

#+begin_quote
  A rewrite of 'Harry Potter and the Marriage Contracts' done to improve some of the story elements, cut down on the Weasley bashing, and generally make a bit more sense. The changes are minor, but I believe make for a better story.

*** Adding a quote from the story:

#+begin_quote
  ...what matters is that she is Harry's friend... Whatever happens, you are going to have to face the fact that if Hermione calls Harry will go to her. I don't think Harry's in love with her; I think he cares about her. Any woman in his life is going to have to share him with Hermione Granger.
