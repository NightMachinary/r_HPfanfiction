** It would be an interesting experiment to do that kind of stilted, failed attempt at an old-fashioned speech on purpose, as in a trend among some pureblood and wannabe pureblood kids to distance themselves from muggle culture. They would greet each other with "Well met, Miss Parkinson", do more and more elaborate bows, eat with special knives, and even their DE parents would roll their eyes at them.

** It happens in fics where the author really wanted to write about adults, but for some reason sticks to the canon-ages. This is also why you get weirdly sexual situations in most of these fics, and why they have to emancipate a teenaged character.

I think the most frustrating one is when they tease you with an amazingly written setup, like an unbreakable trio of Ron, Harry and Hermione scavenging through the post-nuclear wasteland, or Harry sitting within a prison cell as the last fellow wizard is wheeled away for demented experiments by some private company, or anything of that nature, and they do a bait-and-switch and the second chapter is the main character waking up as their younger self, and the fic is 500k words with nothing differentiating it from the story of the books in any way.

*** one thing that is a challenge about this world for me writing it is that you're expected to go be a fully-functioning adult when you leave school at age 17-18...Lily was only 20 when she had Harry. I didn't have a clue wtf I was doing at 20

** To be fair - I can see this happening for the economically well-off characters. I remember even back in elementary school they would actively encourage us to use more complex or nuanced words, similarly my parents would not stand for any sort of contractions or "ehrms" at the dinner table. Especially for those from the Old Families, I can easily see that happening. A distinct language structure that clearly separates them from the rest of the population.

We see it all the time in our actual interactions as well, word choices are a very easy but direct method of communicating all necessary social structures to one another (abstracting from general rules of politeness such as avoiding swear words when speaking to people higher-up than you). It's really not too different from code-switching. And: we like eloquent people. Similarly, the use of this overly posh language can be trained, hence my parents refusing to let me use contractions and more "southern" vernacular.
