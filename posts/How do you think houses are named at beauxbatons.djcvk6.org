I plan on writing a fic set at beauxbatons and was wondering how do you think houses are named there


** Would Beauxbatons have houses? As far as I know, the house system is really only used in Anglophone nations.

**** Anglophone = English speaking. The US is English speaking, and was founded by the British, so yeah, Ilvermorny having houses makes sense.

** I'm in agreement with the others who feel that Beauxbatons wouldn't have Houses, and that it's students are only really separated by year.

** Who says they have houses in the first place? Hogwarts and Ilvermorny do, but other than that I don't think any of the schools were confirmed to have them.

*** And it's worth noting that Ilvermorny has houses /because/ Hogwarts does, as Isolt Sayre, the founder of Ilvermorny, drew inspiration from Hogwarts for how her school would be set up.

** As others have said, there's no good reason for Beauxbatons (or any school outside the anglosphere) to have houses. And plenty reasons against it considering how badly they suck in Canon...

** I heard somewhere that England schools actually have houses and that's where JKR got the idea from? Maybe look into French schools and see if it sparks inspiration.

** At least canonically, Beauxbatons isn't just a French school, but has students from Iberia and the Benelux as well. So you could separate them by nationality.

** It's a practice started in England that spread to America and the Commonwealth, but there are some other schools which use the house system too: [[http://saintmartindefrance.com/boarding-life/houses/]]

So depending on your history, Beauxbatons might follow in the footsteps of Britain. It's conceivable.

Personally, I think it'd be cool if they were sorted into colors. Or go traditional and name them after figures of historical note.

** In the real world, boarding schools are the only ones that really have "Houses", and generally that's only in Europe. Beauxbatons, if my memory is correct, I don't think Beauxbatons is a boarding school. Although, I've been unable to find any proof, so if it is a boarding school, I'd advise looking up some french boarding schools for examples. When in doubt, generate some French surnames and attach them to famous people. Or, look up some famous French wizards. For example: Nicholas Flamel, Pierre Bonaccord, and Lisette de Lapin.
