Tropes might the wrong word. I don't mean things like "Harry goes back to his parents' time to teach DADA." I mean like how Sirius and Marlene McKinnon always have a thing for each other. Or how Teddy always has turquoise hair.

I don't know who came up with the idea that the Ministry has occasional parties, but I'm okay with it as long as it's not monthly white tie balls.

Also, Potter Manor. I mean, James' parents had to live somewhere, but I'm pretty sure someone would have mentioned it to Harry.

I feel like almost every next gen fic I've read has some form of Sunday dinners for the Weasleys, which is a very in-character for them and doesn't bother me, but it seems like a staple of the next-gen fic genre.


** Wards. Literally never mentioned in the books, but security spells are wards in 99% of fics.

I don't know how I feel about the nickname "Mione." I mean, to be fair, there's not a lot you can do with Hermione, nickname-wise. But it still seems weird when anyone but Ron uses it or it's used too often.

Harry as the heir of anyone. Or Harry as flaunting his wealth.

On the Marlene McKinnon thing, she's always Lily's best friend as well. All we know about her is that she was in the Order, nowhere does it say she was anywhere near MWPP/L's age.

*** They alter the wards at the Malfoy Manor at the beginning of the sixth or seventh book I believe. Plus throughout the entire seventh book, Hermione sets up wards around their camps.

One could assume that homes were warded. The Dursley's home was also protected and the Weasley home as well, for a period of time; so it's really easy to say that these homes were warded. I believe even Mad-Eye's wards went off in the fourth book when Barty Crouch Jr snuck in (his wailing garbage cans). And we see that 12 Grimmauld Place was also protected.

As for 'Mione, it's a lot like other nicknames. I don't mind it, so long as it is used sparsely.

Of course I agree with the Harry one you mentioned, he always kept his wealth hidden. He was beautifully modest about it.

I can't comment on Marlene McKinnon because I never read Lily-James centric fics, but it sounds a lot like the Blaise-Draco friendship.

Now, for me, I hate seeing Ron turn into this violent douchewad without explanation. Like suddenly he's an abusive drunk and someone has to save Hermione. Hermione is never weak and will always protect herself, and Ron wouldn't become like that without a valid reason. For a good portion of post-war Dramione fics, there is always an abusive Ron, and I don't see Ron as an abusive character unless somebody messes him up with a spell or something crazy extreme would happen.

I also hate how a lot of Dramione fics have Draco magically being friends with the Golden Trio. It would take time, patience, and a lot of work on both sides. A lot of people seem to ignore this and it irks me.

A quick search on a computer copy doesn't show this by name. Everything is referred to as a charm or spell. "Ward" *is* a shorthand word I like to use in my fanfics, usually after an initial explanation of what that means, because I like to call something simply but exactly and most people will understand what you mean. Strict canon haters gonna hate but still a useful term, I think, as JKR wrote of magic like JRR Tolkien wrote of romantic love -- with severely limited exploration of the critical and interesting elements of the subject matter that discerning readers cared about.

So when I write about magic, I like to categorize and explain it with better, more consistent, and more expressive terminology than was used in a set of children's/young adult's books that were, quite frankly, already far too large without a chapter on how the stunner spell works. And the Harry Potter series isn't about magic or other fantasy elements, when you get right down to it. That is simply a vehicle for the character driven plot, an interesting sideshow to make the world the characters live in more special while giving an effective power fantasy for people to put themselves in. Everyone wants to imagine they have a wand and can cast spells, and that is what the books do even though that doesn't really matter much to the Harry Potter plotline. Very, very little is explained ever about magic in canon, so if you want to write /about/ magic in that 'verse, you need to make a lot of shit up, basically whole cloth.

That being said, I think magical cores kind of make sense. Otherwise it becomes really hard to explain some things. Like what prevents a wizard from "spamming" powerful spells for an hour, or what determines how heavy an object a wizard can lift with Wingardium Leviosa, and so on.

** Some things off the top of my head that I don't like much:

- Harry is a heir of one of the founders and this gives him special powers / perks. (Don't see this much in new fics anymore).

- Harry gains a seat on Wizengamot and suddenly becomes politically savvy. Bonus: makes everyone address him as "Lord". Not addressing him properly is apparently grounds for a duel to the death.

- /Reducto/ makes people's body parts explode, yet somehow is not a Dark or Unforgivable spell.

- Wizarding world is totally backwards from Muggle world in all areas and it's up to the trio to "bring it to the 20th century". (It might be in some ways, but surely it's superior when it comes to things like medicine. I rather enjoyed a fic called "More Equal Than You Know" which portrayed the Wizarding World as superior: clean air, fresh food, longer lifespan, magic makes daily life easy, etc).

Not that these things will stop me from reading a story if I enjoy it at least a little bit.

Thing is, there are some things magic is better at and some things that technology is better at. Actually, it's really hard to know from canon how true that is. Are there hard and fast limits to magic that prevent the wizarding world from accomplishing some of the things muggles have, is it a lack of manpower, or has the scientific method just never taken root?

I'd be cool to see a fic explore this in a balanced way rather than just preaching about how superior one world is over the other.

**** It would seem to me that the main problem is simply lack of imagination or inventiveness - but then again, we know little of how magic is involved in daily lifes of wizards. For example, is a 5 second spell enough for perfectly clean clothes, or do they have to wash them like Muggles do?

The fic I mentioned, "More Equal Than You Know", describes Wizarding bathrooms without going into too much detail. After finishing your business a built-in charm cleans you up, no wiping necessary. After going back to the Dursleys, Harry finds the Muggle way to be inconvenient and unsanitary. (There's probably better examples in that fic, but I only remember this one now. Heh.)

Anyway, it was really nice to read a story where Wizarding world was more advanced for a change. Also it gives more credence to wizards who see Muggles as inferior, which is interesting.

That's canonical, though. A bunch of school children all knew battle-grade spells and were supposed to learn at least a few of them in class.

As an appeal to reason, it's a lot harder to design something that will cut arbitrary material but not people, than to design something that just cuts. So it's a lot more useful for wizards to learn a generic cutting spell -- though limiting the range on it would be sensible; I mean really, who needs to slice bread from across the room?

Yeah, most people do. Which is why its so frequently used. But some people want to hate anything popular just because of that, and want everything they do to be special and different and significant. So hating on the names is an easy target, and therefore makes their decision to call them "Zeliphon and Bernette" in their fanfic ever so /clever/.

I don't mind original names if tastefully done, but why make it harder for a casual reader if they are going to be recurring characters? Why not use what most people already call them?

It bothers me more that they are always either /incredibly/ boring, white-bread, waspy, button-down, sexless helicopter parents who hate Harry, or some kind of hardcore nudist, nutjob gun maniac, obsessed Francophiles trying to pimp their nubile young daughter out to the first Heir of /X/ with a big wand who comes along.

** Dislike:

- Lucius Malfoy is abusive toward Narcissa and Draco and is just as wildly depraved as Greyback.

- /Everyone/ doting on Mrs. Weasley while she helplessly grieves for Fred and /everyone/ looking after shell-shocked George and /everyone/ doing everything they can to help out Teddy Lupin but at no point, *NO POINT*, does anyone simply turn and ask, "Hey Andromeda, it just occurred to me that you were disowned by your original family, built an entirely new one with your husband and then lost both he and your only child within six months of each other...er...you doing okay? Need to talk about anything?"

- Everyone who isn't in Harry's generation went to school with the Marauders.

- No Quidditch or stories involving Quidditch when everyone but Hermione is a player on the school team and even a few go on to play professionally. Even applies to Marauders. Even McGonagall played Quidditch and then bought an 11-year-old the best broom in the world in a desperate bid to beat the Slytherins.

- Neville and Luna start dating and it /isn't/ the most hilariously awkward thing you've ever seen. People fail more at this than they do with "manipulative/evil" Dumbledore being too dumb to manipulate a child.

- "Hey...should we visit Hagrid? I mean, we usually have tea with him like once a week or something like that in canon, so do you think we should drop by? No? Oh, ok then, nevermind."

Like

- Fred's ghost. Not canon but totally believable.

- Any "unlikely" POVs like Percy or Dean or Hagrid or other any Hogwarts professor not named Snape or McGonagall.

- Rozencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead type of setting where you can sort of look over the fence and see the canon story happening while your story happens alongside and is affected by the canon events as well as your own. Hogwarts during DH and Yule Ball fics are inherently the best at this.

- Christmas/wedding/funeral/big unjustified gathering at The Burrow.

- Dumbledore/Grindelwald/Voldemort origin stories.

- Blacks/Malfoys/Powerful Pureblood families and their whole Downton Abbey-social circle-estate holding sort of party circuit thing. Those are fun stories.

And I particularly mind fics that have him constantly spout off "For the Greater Good." At risk of /reducto ad hitlerum/, that's like having Angela Merkel using the phrase "Arbeit macht frei" with any degree of seriousness. It is /literally/ an allusion to the Holocaust.

The problem is when writing a manipulative character, you have to be intelligent enough to pull it off. I've read fics that have Dumbledore doing this:

"Hey Harry, why don't you live with your abusive relatives again?"

"No," Harry replied, as his magical core tripled in size,

Methods of Rationality expresses this idea well.

/Father had once taken him to see a play called [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Note][The Tragedy of Light]], about this incredibly clever Slytherin named Light who'd set out to purify the world of evil using an ancient ring that could kill anyone whose name and face he knew, and who'd been opposed by another incredibly clever Slytherin, a villain named Lawliet, who'd worn a disguise to conceal his true face; and Draco had shouted and cheered at all the right parts, especially in the middle; and then the play had ended sadly and Draco had been hugely disappointed and Father had gently pointed out that the word 'Tragedy' was right there in the title./

/Afterward, Father had asked Draco if he understood why they had gone to see this play./

/Draco had said it was to teach him to be as cunning as Light and Lawliet when he grew up./

/Father had said that Draco couldn't possibly be more wrong, and pointed out that while Lawliet had cleverly concealed his face there had been no good reason for him to tell Light his name. Father had then gone on to demolish almost every part of the play, while Draco listened with his eyes growing wider and wider. And Father had finished by saying that plays like this were always unrealistic, because if the playwright had known what someone actually as smart as Light would actually do, the playwright would have tried to take over the world himself instead of just writing plays about it./

** Lots have people have given their least favorites, which is totally fine, but I thought I'd give a couple of the memes/tropes that I like.

-Good Dumbledore and Good Weasleys. I just get really tired of manipulative/evil Dumbledore and crazy/greedy Weasleys, and it's refreshing to read a fic by someone who /doesn't/ hate everyone who was a good guy in canon.

-Expanded magic. I know a lot of people get annoyed with talk of wards or magical cores, but I like when an author takes the time to expand the world of magic like that. It makes things more interesting.

-The Sorting Hat being named Alistair. I have no idea where this came from, but I like it.

-Post-war fics where the members of the DA get together and go to pubs/have parties/socialize on a regular basis. I feel like going through something like that (much like surviving a troll when you're a first year) creates a bond that can't be forgotten. Plus it's fun. We don't see enough of the other kids in Harry's year in the books. (That was /one thing/ that I liked about the movies).

-In general, I like time travel. There is a lot of crap in the genre, but when it's good it's very enjoyable to me.

I get just as bent or even moreso if Harry's new Slytherin girlfriend (aside from Narcissa, which is its own surreal scenario) is the one with full powers of insight and persuasion in the political arena and in dealing with Gringotts. At sixteen.

** "Ronald" and "Mione" infuriate me 99% of the time. Ron is hardly ever referred to as Ronald in canon. If Mrs. Weasley does it on occasion, I can believe it, but stories where Hermione calls Ron "Ronald" consistently drive me nuts. I know this comes from the movies, but the only time in the books that she calls him Ronald is when he returns in Deathly Hallows, I am pretty sure. And I don't even know where "Mione" comes from. Yes, I get that Hermione as a name does not lend itself to a lot of nicknames, but why force it? A nickname is so unneeded for her character.

On a similar note, I really dislike "Mom." I get that UK slang is difficult if you're not from the UK, but how hard is it to get "Mum" right?

** One I like is: Dumbledore is actually a very intelligent, extremely dangerous, but also thoroughly good person. /And the reader is shown this/.

He makes mistakes in the fanfic, sure, but you can see he is still fighting the good fight all the time and does his best in a very, very bad situation. As in canon, he thinks of Harry as a tool initially but not after meeting him. After that, he tries to leave Harry alone for the most part, giving him a chance to grow up before surely having to face Voldemort because of the prophecy. This certainly won't happen until after Harry graduates, right? Surely fate doesn't hate the poor boy that much? But as this is fanfic, sometimes some of those plans don't work out /for reasons/, sometimes the same as in canon.

--------------

All that may be what we are /told/ Dumbledore is like in canon, but it is /not/ clearly *shown* in canon, where he is never doing anything interesting until the last few chapters of the book, and even then you don't see why or how he does what he does. Fanfic often fixes this issue by allowing adults in the Potter 'verse to be competent and interactive entities, and that's one idea I like a lot.

Incidentally, "Harry in America" is one of the tropes I cannot stand unless it's done really, really well ("Harry In Vegas, Briefly," on the other hand, can be hilarious).

And that's the real thing. Every one of the overused tropes, even Evil!Dumbledore, which I cannot stand, can make for an exceptionally good story /if done well/.

I mean, I get proposals and stuff due to marriage contracts (if the writer is good enough to make this scenario plausible), but it's just ridiculous how so many people met "their one and true love" at Hogwarts in their first relationship, propose within half a year and are married before being 18.
