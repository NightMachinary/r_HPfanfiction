I've been working on my first HP fic for about a year now. It's maybe a third of the way into book one of a planned trilogy, which could also be expanded to a full set of eight if I stick out that long.

Problem is, I started it when I was new to the fandom. When there was a certain sort of story I wanted to read and hadn't found yet anywhere. Now, I've seen how many better stories are out there, and how much of a mess my beginning is, and I have a hard time caring enough to keep on.

I don't believe in abandoning stories, and there are several ideas yet in my plan - not /great/, perhaps, but which I've still not seen anywhere else - so even if it's not as groundbreaking or unique as I'd at first thought, I want to carry on. But I'm not sure how to inspire myself. I feel like I've lost the spark of it.

Anyone have tips for getting back in the groove? Secrets to overcoming that feeling that a story isn't worth continuing? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

By keeping to a schedule.

Writing is work. It's hard. It doesn't come easily. And one of the absolute worst things to do while writing is reading. Because reading is easy. And distracts from how difficult writing can be. And often you'll just start comparing this to that and whatnot which is entirely unhelpful.

If you want to write. Then write. Focus on writing. Make writing the priority. If you're waiting around for 'inspiration' or 'sparks' you're never going to be an effective writer.

Sure, there will be points where you need a break, like any other job in the world. But you won't truly understand that until you've gotten yourself into the habit of writing.

*** Indeed. Make a schedule, and force yourself to adhere to it. I've got a daily goal of 800 to 1000 words, and a weekly goal of a chapter of at least 8K words. Just sit down and do a scene. One per day, X per week, whatever works.

*** Funnily enough, I find reading to be a motivational factor for me to write. Just a few weeks ago I was reading Stephen King's "The Outsider" and at the same time was on a writing high. Now that I've finished it, I've been lost in a trough of not writing. Of course, everyone's different but reading and writing certainly go hand-in-hand.

*** Thank you. I kinda had the same sort of thought, but hearing it properly articulated really helps solidify it for me. I think this is what I needed.

[Well, except about the reading thing. Comparing, yes - deadly - but I personally find the times when I read most and write best tend to coincide.]

*** Have you by chance read, "On Writing" by Stephen King? I've read through your reddit and some of the advice you give sounds fairly similar to Mr. King's. Of course, it's good advice and sharing it by any means is great, I'm just asking since I recently finished it.

**** I have but probably about fifteen years ago by this point and I don't remember anything specific enough from it. My advice is fairly general and just involves treating writing like any other discipline that requires time and practice. It comes mostly from my own experience and epiphany that such phrases like 'I lost my muse' or 'I'm not inspired' were really just fancy ways of saying 'I'm lazy and don't feel like doing the work right now'.

It holds true for far more than writing. A lot of 'talents' that take time and practice to get good at involves actually doing it. And a lot of people simply don't want to put forth the effort or think it will be easy and that's never the case.

** Edit: Sorry mate, I glanced over your post briefly and didn't realize your actual question. /le facepalm/

Realize this: the spark, the zone, the waves, the mood, the Right Time, etc. etc. don't exist.

Writing is working. I'm not going to tell my boss: "Sorry, I'm not working today, I lost my spark."

Just tell yourself: I'm going to write 100 words, and if they're bland and uninspiring, so what? I'll go back this evening or tomorrow morning and fix it.

*** I don't know poodles about editing, apart from basic reworking sentences and fixing errors, but I guess you're right that having anything is better than having nothing. And if nothing else, keeping in the practice of putting down words should eventually make my imagination take notice and get back to work sooner or later. :3

** There's a book by Stephen King called, "On Writing" and I've found his advice makes it much easier to write stories.

Don't show a soul what you've written until you've finished the first draft. "Write the first draft with your door closed and your second with your door open". Showing off your writing before you've finished your story can make a writer lethargic because they think they're doing "great", so you don't work as hard. On the other hand, it can discourage an author because people criticize the story too harshly. Wait until you've written your first draft, then show it to others. After you've shown it to a few people (such as friends or maybe even a beta or two), make changes that you deem appropriate from the feedback you've got from your first few readers. Remember, it's your story, so you decide what stays, what goes, and what can be added. After making those changes, start posting! You'll get more feedback from a larger and broader audience. Then, you can make little tweaks that you want to make. Boom. Now you have a story. Then you do it all over again.

Read and write every day. You can take one break per week. I personally take Sundays off. Your brain is a muscle and you should be exercising it, even if you're tired. It'll do you good in the end. Think of reading like lifting weights or using machines. It makes your own writing stronger because it gives you a better idea of the do's and don't's of writing. Writing is your cardio. If you write every day, you'll start to be able to write longer and faster. Just like working out, it has to be consistent. Take too many breaks or too long of breaks and you can end up in the state you're in now; lethargy. Lethargy has been the death knell of many of my stories or story ideas.

Writing is hard work, but it certainly pays off. Keep at it and believe in yourself!

** Have you posted any of it yet? If not, it might be an opportunity to take a step back and assess the current state of the story and what you want to do going forward. It might also be a good idea to maybe write a few smaller stories in the same world you have in mind for your larger one. This would give you a feeling of accomplishment because, hey, you finished a thing! Also, writing a few small stories might give you ideas for your world building. When I started writing HP fan fiction years ago, I limited myself to one-shots on purpose because I had a bad habit of not finishing longer stories and I feel like this helped me create a persistent HP world of my own.

If you have posted part of it, there's no shame in letting it lie fallow for a little while so you can work on some other things. You're also free to take it down--don't feel like you're obligated to keep plugging away at it if you don't like what you're writing. You're not being paid, you're not on a deadline--it's completely up to you.

*** I've been posting as I finish each chapter. I've tried a couple hiatii, and they only made it harder to get the groove back when I returned, and as I'm quite a forgetful person I feel it's dangerous to allow myself too many breaks.

I like your idea of making short asides, just to get back into the world of it. Maybe some side-characters or a villain pov to pique my interest again. Thanks!

** The first million or so words you write will be terrible. That's fine, dont' sweat it.

Also, are you doing this for fun or for some other reason? Because sometimes you have to push through it to get to the fun, and other times it's just not worth it.

** Doing anything purely on inspiration sucks and is doomed to fail. If you write when you're inspired, you'll get the high points of the fic, but not anything else. What I try to do is make an outline. So in chapter 1 you have the high points - point A, point B, point C, etc. Then you just try to connect point A to point B however you can. It might be the most dull thing you've ever written, but as long as they are connected, you've done your job as a writer. Making it pretty is the editor's job, and you'll take up that job later.

As for overcoming the feeling that a story isn't worth continuing... that's all on you, mate. I can't sell your own story to you. If you don't think it's worth continuing, don't continue it. Find something that interests you and makes you want to puzzle it out. Take all your favorite stuff and mash it together and figure out how to make it work. If HP fanfiction doesn't excite you anymore, then that's that.

*** Hmm, I've never really been good at outlining, maybe should give it another go. If I have a structure to write around, scenes to write toward, that might help me stay focused if not exactly inspired.

The biggest problem is I have so many ideas, it gets hard taking the time to actually finish one instead of skipping gaily on to the next thing that pops into my head. I am far too fickle, and that's not a good thing for a writer. I don't want to be another never-finishing-things person.

**** Yeah, like another person said: Writing is work. You have the stuff you're inspired to write, and then you have eeeeeeverything else. The inspiration is 10-20% at most. The rest is filling in the blank space with words. They don't even have to be good words, but there have to be words.

**** I told you that I make outlines and try to connect the high points, but specifically what I do is just ask myself "Ok, what do they do next? What do they do after that? After that? After that?" Writing is very much a step by step process. Just write the most mundane crap: He did this. She did that. She said this. He responded to that. Don't deviate with flowery descriptions unless you are good at that. Just keep putting one foot in front of the other until you have connected point A to point B. Then repeat that until your story is finished.
