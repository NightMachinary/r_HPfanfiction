I remember reading a really badly written story with a crazy sick plot line, but I can't remember the name.

Snape is a vampire and he and Hermione start a sexual relationship together. At one point he makes her orgasm across the table with his mind. At another point he drinks her menstrual fluid and she's cool with it.

It's really long and pretty crazy.

Anyone recognize this?
