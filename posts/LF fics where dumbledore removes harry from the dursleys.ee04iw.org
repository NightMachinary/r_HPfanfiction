i am getting a bit tired of the extremely competent harry and helpful goblins and was hoping for fics where dumbledore himself removes harry from privet drive and places him with another family preferably with someone like andromeda or Amelia bones basically someone that could help properly shape harry into a powerful wizard

preferably this all happens after first year but before 4th and no bashing no slash and no hinny

*** i know its annoying

i can understand making him antagonistic but the bashing is just a horrible writing crutch to avoid developing characters
