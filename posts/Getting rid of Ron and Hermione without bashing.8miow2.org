Using only canon events, what's the easiest way to gget rid of Ron and Hermione, without bashing them. Just makinig them fade into the background, not killing them, them not starting an "Anti-Harry" crusade, them just being there, and Harry not really caring either way?

For Ron, the first real chance is the Duel with Malfoy. Being basically forced into something he doesn't even know what it is by Ron accepting for him, it'd piss most people (Though Harry = Wizard Jesus) off.

Hermione, outside of not befriending her in the first place (She was a pain in the ass before she joined Harry and Ron), i can't think of a "Sorry Hermione, but that's going too far" Moment, outside of her throwing a fit over the HBP Book, but they'd been through battles together at that point (Hermione should have known better, but forgiving her over that, even if you're not quite as close makes more sense given what they've been through)

*** I was hoping for actively shoving them into the background. Harry's reliance on Hermione is boring (and usually even worse in fanfiction where Hermione is written as a Beautiful genius that knows more than Dumbledore - aka, written badly) I'd rather them just "gone" as such. Like, Harry didn't appreciate Ron forcing him into a Duel.

Would having Harry feel like Hermione is undermining his intelligence by constantly checking his essays without him asking count as bashing? That'd be a way for them to break off a little otherwise

**** tbh the duel thing wouldn't piss me off. I'd view it as someone taking my back and I'd be grateful that he stuck up for me---b/c wasn't Malfoy's intention like to humiliate Harry for not knowing what a duel was?

***** I just wouldn't have gone, at the very least. it was a clear trap. "Midnigiht in the trophy room" come on, that just screams IT'S A TRAP. Harry didn't really want to go anyway, and Ron kind of pressured him into it, if i recall.

****** Not really for 11 year olds, it's basically a fight behind the school at 4 when all the teachers are gone. It's not like they could have had a fight in the Great Hall or out in the open, they'd get caught, and if they had spectators one might snitch. Basically choosing an obscure location at the dead of night was their only option to avoid getting in trouble.

******* Is Duelling actually against the rules at Hogwarts if it's sanctioned or is that just fanon? Could one of them just said "Why not after Dinner in the Great Hall, or are you too scared?" They DID have a Duelling club, so it implies that sort of thing happens.

I was paranoid at 11 i admit, but that's because i hated Primary so I'd have seen it as a trap.

**** Harry's friendship with Ron started on the Hogwarts Express, since Harry sat alone and Ron said everywhere else was full, so ideally Harry sitting with other people on the Hogwarts Express, though I'd advise against Draco, since Harry already had a dislike for him from their first meeting in Diagon Alley.

** Hermione dies to the troll (really is it that hard to believe two eleven year olds couldn't stop a dangerous beast?). Harry know Ron was a big part of why she was in the bathroom crying. Harry realises that was bullying and he doesn't want to be the Piers Polkins to Ron's Dudley. Harry politely distances himself. Ron is annoyed but forms a close friendship with Seamus and Dean like in the fourth book. That leaves you with a Harry who realises that Hogwarts isn't entirely safe. The magical world is dangerous and a staff feeling they need to do more to protect the students. If Dumbledore knew about Quirrelmort then would he deem that too far and drive him out the castle?

** When Ron doesn't believe that Harry didn't put his name in the goblet of fire, that could end their friendship. Equally when Rita Skeeter starts rumours that there's something going on between Harry and Hermione, Hermione could distance herself because it causes friction in her relationship with Krum or Harry decides that Hermione is encouraging the rumours somehow by constantly being around him so he distances himself or they argue.

Or, if you want something earlier, at the beginning when Draco tells Harry not to be friends with Ron and to pick "better" friends, Harry listens to him. Either becoming friends properly with Draco (maybe even ending up in Slytherin because he doesn't know to ask the hat not to put him there) or temporarily being friendly with Draco, realising they don't get along and Harry drifting towards other people who aren't Ron or Hermione.

*** Ideally early, but with still Gryffindor Harry. Weaning him off of Ron and Hermione's support, so you can have an actual independent Harry without making him Lord everything cliche. For Ron i was actually thinking "Harry quits Quidditch after first year because Wood had too many practices taking up way too much time, after seeing Voldemort still alive, it gave Harry a wake up call", but Ron doesn't understand why Harry wants to quit, so they kind of part on neutral terms . For Hermione... I really don't know.

**** I can't remember when Ron tells Harry that Slytherin is bad. If it was on the train or before Draco speaks to Harry, then Harry could snub Ron when Draco tells him to but still be in Gryffindor so Ron doesn't want to be his friend. Ron and Harry's relationship could be like him and Seamus/Dean's, so friendly but not really friends. Dean and Harry could bond over being from the muggle world, possibly Dean could introduce him to football/Harry could already have an interest in it and that's where their friendship starts and then you don't need to worry about breaking up any friendships since Ron/Harry are just acquaintances. You don't even need to address any potential friendship with Hermione. Harry ignores most girls early on so could ignore Hermione too.

I'm not sure if Harry quitting quidditch would be enough to break up Ron and Harry's friendship since Ron is Harry's first ever friend it seems so would take something quite substantial to end that. Also, if Harry wasn't seeker, wouldn't Ginny take on that position so Ron wouldn't be resentful of Harry quitting quidditch when it paves the way for his sister to be on the team eventually.

***** After First Year, and Ron is obsessed with Quidditch. Harry might not want them to break up the friendship, but they'd at least be a lot less close. Ginny would be a first year, there'd be no Seeker til 3rd year and would Ginny have the confidence to try out at that point. Ron would get jealous of Harry throwing away the oppertunity, Harry would be like "If you want it so much, you go for it yourself, you can even use my Broom" and who knows?

** Just have him befriend other people. 11 year olds aren't that complicated. The most plausible chain of events is just him meeting all the Gryffindors, and then he simply gets on better with someone else. It's the standard first year at a new school: everyone sort of makes an effort for the first few weeks to talk to everyone else and then end up fitting together in groups depending on their various interests.

Maybe Harry gets on well with Seamus or Dean and spends his time talking/studying/goofing around with them. Maybe he finds comradeship in the Quidditch team and their assorted friends. Maybe Harry sits next to some Hufflepuffs in class and finds them friendlier than he's ever experienced before Hogwarts and so hangs out with them.

There doesn't need to be a definitive "break" point for Harry to not hang out with Ron and Hermione, they can be ushered into side characterdom organically as simply as choosing to spend more time with other people. To do otherwise is often just drama for drama's sake.

I bet the twins would love using it , as it is doubtfull they can already cast a disilusionment spell (much less full invisibility Dumbledore style))? I mean it should be clear that the twins no all sorts of interesting magic! You can then have Ron fall by the wayside as the older students are just more usefull to a Harry who is driven (Ron isn't, he's a slacker!) and wants to learn and make something of himself!

If you want to have no Ron in your fic, and it starts before first year, simply have Ron pass up Harry's compartment in the train, perhaps using reasoning like in the above fic. From there he can stay relatively out of focus for the rest of the fic.

Hermione's a bit trickier; at the start she's a bit bossy and obnoxious (It's 'levi-O-sa') and realistically would cast a bit of a shadow over any scene she appears in because of it. Still, she's just trying to help, so given time everyone could get used to her and vice versa and she could fade into the background as a helpful resource to all of our non-protagonist students.

For later years...Hermione is almost-bludgeoned by a troll, Ron /is/ bludgeoned by a giant stone knight, Hermione gets petrified by a basilisk, Ron is nearly eaten by giant spiders, then they all have to endure Dementors, Ron is 'attacked' by Sirius Black and has to deal with the fact that a grown man (le Wormtail) was sleeping with him in his bed for years...honestly, when the only thing that really happens to the two of them in their fourth year is being held hostage at the bottom of a freezing cold lake, it must be a relief. And then at the end of that year Voldemort is revived, blood traitors and mudbloods beware.

So at pretty much any time, Ron could go, "Mate, I'm sure you've noticed, but ever since we came to Hogwarts it's been one life-threatening...threat, after another. And now You-Know-Who's back, in a body I mean, and Hermione & I, well, we're probably on the top-five of his hit-list. Hermione's parents and Mum and Dad are all planning to pack up and move to Jamaica, think you can talk your aunt into getting out too?"

And Harry could go, "Nah, mate, someone's gotta stop Voldy. He'd probably come after me anyway if I went abroad. I'll owl you when it's safe to come back, alrighty?"

** Ditching Hermione... The firebolt, but thats kind of a dick move. SPEW... Cursing the signup sheet for DA. I think a canon Hermione would not compromise her values to keep her friends. So if the friends called her on it.. easy split. But easiest you've already said, just do the Troll save, but then Harry doesn't befriend her.

You can get 2 for 1 and have Harry ditch Ron because of how he treated Hermione before the Troll. Harry doesn't want a friend who knows all about him from books. Harry doesn't want a bully for a friend.

** Maybe just have Harry apprentice under someone since he's got Voldemort after him? Like if he studies under Dumbledore early on, you wouldn't need to axe Hermione since he wouldn't be as reliant on her. Assuming the troll incident happened, there's not really much that could believably wedge their friendship apart unless it was really heavy-handed. The firebolt incident was practically nothing, Harry was being pretty stupid, and that aside I can't see a split likely to happen without someone being very OOC. I mean, she was willing to give up someone she was in love with and modify her parent's memories to keep helping him in DH, and deal with persistent public backlash and harassment in GoF. Hermione is self reliant, but doesn't seem willing to drop her first friendship.

As for Ron, eh, there are lots of possibilities if you simply must drop him. The midnight duel, making fun of Hermione (wouldn't Harry hate bullying?), his idea to fly the car to Hogwarts landing them in hot water (ok, tbf Harry was stupid for agreeing), etc. Some non-canon compliant events could be if for some reason Harry has to keep spending money on something and Ron grows more and more jealous at his wealth. Heck, maybe he'd be really annoyed that Harry didn't pay for him to get a new wand when his busted in book 2. I dunno.
