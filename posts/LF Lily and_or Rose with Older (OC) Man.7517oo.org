Older OC Man is what i prefer and it would be very good if he is painting as a Hobby (can be any artistic Hobby), so he paints his lover in normal, but also in nude painting/models. If her Mother see the Paintings and offer to also perform for a painting (to have a present for the Husband) it would be nice, but its no requirement. Also that the OC is rather shy than eager to show his lovers Model paintings to her Parents (an angry Ron is imaginable) is a possible option.

Well, i said OC, but im fine if any other Older Man is dating the Girls, as long as he perform an artistic Hobby, involving his lover. If there are no Rose/Lily ones, it would be ok, if its any other "Next Generation" Child.

Hmm, if i think closely, i guess a Femslash Fic (which doesnt have to have an Older Woman, if there are any at all) would also be an attraction, so if there are some, let me know.


** I don't know of anything that takes the "sleep with your subject" /Cheers/ story line. I could be wrong but this is obscure enough and specific enough that unless you know of a specific story of this type and are looking for a lost fic, I'd be surprised if it exists.

That said, a good Older Man + Rose story is linkffn(a strictly legal matter by bad mum), which puts Rose with Draco.

  Draco Malfoy is employing Rose Weasley to do some legal legwork for him. Their meetings are strictly business, but Draco wants more. Does Rose? For the "I never" challnge at the Sober Universe Forum, and very unlike my usual work. Rated M for a reason.

** Dean paints Lily- linkao3(2394164).

Rather creepy, because it has Dean still carrying the torch for Ginny and channelling that lust through her daughter. So do keep that it mind.

*** Because, usually in this Genre im looking for Older Woman and Younger Man/Boy. But i have read multiple fics, that contained Harry/Lily or other Father/Daughter, Aunt/Nephew couples. Why does he have to be old? i think, he can bring his younger lover with his experience and skills into Heavens of Pleasure. Or do you mean "Old" by High Age/Granny-like? Gross, no, not that old O.o
