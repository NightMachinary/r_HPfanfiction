Just read the fic Fantastic House Elves and Where to Find Them, and I loved how he had absolutely no interest in doing anything other than what he was already doing. I also really liked the traipsing through the forest aspect. Maybe he's traveling and meeting random characters. Maybe he has a companion or two, maybe not. Need more dgaf Harry


** I don't really remember the fic you are mentioning (i read it a long time ago), but two fics can correspond to what you are looking for. - Harry the Hufflepuff linkff(6466185): harry is uber lazy, and everything he does is to enable his laziness - Harry potter and the sun source linkff(4532363) : harry is an assassin and cares for nothing

**** That is still one of my most favourite gags in HP Fanfics. I have this weird memory of a SI fic where the narrator teased doing it on Hermione in front of Harry in the RoR and it actually seemed to be working and I just cracked up. Or it could be just be a pretty bizarre fever dream.

***** It's not a fever dream and Harry had tried it on an annoying portret of a posh old Slytherin lady as well. I thing it might have been in "The Curse of Truth".

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

*** Definitely enjoyed Harry the Hufflepuff for his not caring at all about Hogwarts and his education. Especially enjoying fics with flippant disregard for Voldemort. In Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them, Harry thinks Voldie and Quirell are the same person and doesn't really know or care about Voldemort
