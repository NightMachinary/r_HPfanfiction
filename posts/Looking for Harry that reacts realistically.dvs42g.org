So I've been rewatching the movies recently, and as usual I've found myself lambasting just how nonchalantly Harry takes everything that happens to him throughout the story. I want a Harry that finds that schoolyard BS doesn't really mean much to him when he's lived through near death experiences multiple times, and is one of the few people who know for sure that Voldemort is still alive in one form or another.

As for specifics - No slash, No overt bashing, Preferably no Ginny/Harry

Thanks
