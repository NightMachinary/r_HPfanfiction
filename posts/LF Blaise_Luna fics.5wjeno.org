Hi, could anybody recommend a fic about Blaise Zabini and Luna Lovegood getting together ? I've just read a Drarry where these characters were a couple ; it was not the focus of the story and yet I found this pairing to be really intriguing. I would like to read some good work about them, be it as a OS or as a multi-chapter fic.


** Isolation by Bex-chan linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6291747/1/Isolation]]). Main pairing is Dramione, but Luna and Blaise have a very nice relationship in the latter half of the story. Also one of the best HP fanfics, IMO.

  He can't leave the room. Her room. And it's all the Order's fault. Confined to a small space with only the Mudblood for company, something's going to give. Maybe his sanity. Maybe not. "There," she spat. "Now your Blood's filthy too!" DM/HG. PostHBP.

*** I think Blaise only spoke once in a HP book (Half-Blood Prince). We didn't even know he was male until then.

The only Blaise/Luna relationship I recall was in the ending of White Knight, Grey Queen.

*** They could have. We don't know much about any characters except the trio, Dumbledore, Snape and Tom Riddle.
