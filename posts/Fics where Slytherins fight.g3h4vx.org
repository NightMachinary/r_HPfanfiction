I'm looking for fics where Slytherin students fight in the final battle against the Death Eaters. It can be an expansion of canon (like, Slytherin students sneaking back in after they're told to go to the dungeons, we just don't see it in canon bc Harry doesn't notice) or completely AU, or anything in between.

  Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to figure out why.

** I don't remember when they were told to go to the dungeons. IIRC McGonagall was evacuating the school when I think Ernie said that he wanted to help defend the castle to which McGonagall responded by saying anyone who wants to help can stay the others can leave with Filch. When did it happen?

*** They were told to go to the dungeons in the movie. But they were evacuated, along with the other houses, in the book. Alone among the four houses, no adult Slytherin student stayed back to fight in the battle.
