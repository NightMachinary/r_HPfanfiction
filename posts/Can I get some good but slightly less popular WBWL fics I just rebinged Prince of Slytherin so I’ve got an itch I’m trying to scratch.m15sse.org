  Harry Potter's life had been hell. He'd spent ten agonizing years slaving away for his only living relatives, only managing to escape through the surprising hospitality of a strange book store owner. On his eleventh birthday, he discovers things about himself he'd thought were only fantasies, but the greatest revelation was that he had a younger sister who'd somehow saved the world.Inspired by Sarcasm and Slytherin.

I'm going to make you listen, because I want you to understand how you made me a monster. I'll call this story antithesis, and you're going to learn every single moment where things went wrong. I want you to cry, and beg for me to kill you, and when I'm done with this, you're going to want to do that to yourself. You're going to listen, because in the end, you owe me that much. You owe me so much more, but here we are, and this is how it's going to end. Who knows, maybe this useless battle between you and me and this bloody world, well, maybe we always were fated to kill each other. Do you know what it is like to be unmade?

  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's POV. Story is complete through the 2nd task, the rest posted as outlines.

  Harriet Potter has always been odd. Between having a shadow that moves on its own and chatting with snakes in the garden, learning she's a witch really isn't the strangest thing that's happened to the bespectacled girl with a lightning scar on her neck. [Fem!Harry, Slytherin!Harry, AU Retelling]

**** They have a very different style to POS or AOC with a greater focus on characters and introspection than worldbuilding or plotting. CDT follows Canon too closely but compensates with its atmosphere and consistent but canon-non-compliant characterization. Firestarter has excellent plot and some original ideas but I find it to a bit too dry. HP and the Bucket list has excellent pacing with little to no repetition of canon scenes and tons of original ideas , Four years covered in half a year of real time, most likely will be completed first.

** Linkffn(Green in the Grey) and The Black Princess series (take the Author's note at the beginning seriously, but it has a lot of the PoS feel IMO) both come to mind. I also second Three Black Birds

  A prophecy left unfulfilled, a family torn apart by repercussions of war and one child left to a life of neglect. But there were those not content to allow this to pass. Harry Potter may have been abandoned at the end of the war but he will rise to be more than any could have imagined. Minimal bashing, rated M for violence etc. Harry/Tonks, James/Lily Main plot begins GOF

** linkffn(He Has Risen Above)

Nowhere near as well known as some of the others but I quite like this one, mainly because while it starts off as your typical WBWL, it's gets way less pretentious and has the characters acting (generally) the age they are instead of being child politicians

  James and Lily live in 1981. Harry is the real BWL but everybody thinks it's his twin, Daniel Potter. Abandoned by his parents, raised by his grandparents, he will prove they were wrong to leave him. Grey Harry. Certain Weasley bashing, Dumbledore bashing, Hermione bashing, Potter bashing. Neutral Snape. Redemption arcs to come. Harry/Daphne
