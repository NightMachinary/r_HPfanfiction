Ok, I'm hoping I can explain this well enough. I'm working on a fic that is AU canon divergence. The issue that I'm running into is that readers are asking/going to have questions about things that only kinda sorta matter to the story. And more importantly, things that the character in the story wouldn't think to question. For example, the main character (Snape) isn't going to wonder why Ron reads books, because the Ron in this universe reads books. That's just a fact as Snape knows it. But the readers are going to ask what changed to make Ron more bookish than he was in canon. There actually is an answer to that question, but the "why" really doesn't matter to the story and there's really no logical reason that I can think of to bring it up within the story... Because the characters wouldn't know that it was "different" and thus wouldn't care. I suppose in this instance I could just /not/ make Ron bookish, but there are, or will be, other examples of things that are changed from canon that matter more.

So my question is, what is the best way to handle this? I've considered throwing it into the story, but it seems really really forced, especially coming from Snape. I considered (and tried) throwing in a few chapters from other character's perspectives, but it messed with the flow of the story. But I worry if I just gloss over it, I'm going to end up with a bunch of annoyed readers? And much as I shouldn't care, lol, I really really do care...

Side note, I am a very new author...


** Maybe you could have Snape overhear a conversation about how different Ron is from his older brothers (Fred and George) and why? Like a conversation in the staff room with McGonagoll talking about how pleased she is that he's followed in Percy's footsteps instead, or something.

Personally if I was reading it, I'd rather have no explanation than a clumsy, forced one, but what I'd like best is to have a really subtle exposition, with hints dropped around so that curious readers can put it together themselves, but it stays out of the focus of the story.

**** You don't even need a conversation. If you are using Snape's POV, just have him be angry at the twins, and compare them to "The two bookkish Weasleys", Percy and Ron in his inner monologue. He doesn't even have to know the reason, since it's not important, only that the boy was an avid reader from teh start. Maybe mention chess as his hobby too.

Generally, it begins with the question of whether you are doing it because you care about Ron as a character and do not want him not to make sense, or whether you are doing it in order to avoid people with torches and pitchforks.

Assuming it is the former, then what you need to do is give people some kind of reference that something had caused Ron to change in such a way, and that in itself should be enough for as long as you do not do anything that would realistically make it impossible for Ron to change in such a way. That said, for Ron his unwillingness to spend time on books is something that is caused by something else, something that is a core attribute of his character, so if you want to do it realistically then you /will/ have to rebuild his character from the ground up.

I guess the thing to start with would be to make sure that you /do/ know what kind of character Ron actually is. So, do you?

*** I actually don't know lol. I think I do. I know why I believe Ron acted the way he did in canon... Being the last son, feeling he could never live up to his older brothers, and feeling that even if he did succeed at something, it wouldn't actually be appreciated because one of his brothers had already done it, and probably done it better. I believe that he didn't put the effort in because he just didn't see the point.

Would you agree?

**** Yes, pretty much. So with that (and I will note that knowing this already puts you ahead many a person trying to write him), you just need to come up with a reason for why would he see reading books as something that would be an exception to this, or perhaps even something more. If you can think of a reason for that to happen and can put readable enough hints about that, you should do alright.

***** So, basically my thought process is this.

Slight backstory, Harry gets misplaced in the muggle world and doesn't make it to Hogwarts until the summer between 5th and 6th year. Thus the divergence.

In the story, Ginny dies, killed by the Horcrux in Ron's second year. Ron spends a lot of time blaming himself, maybe if he'd paid better attention to his sister, maybe if he hadn't been so wrapped up in his own life, maybe if he'd listened to that know-it-all Granger (granted, Hermione doesn't know the monster is a Basilisk, since she doesn't have the "snake" clue from Harry, but she still spends a lot of time in the library trying to figure it out). Anyways, massive case of survivors guilt. He essentially spends a summer knowing that the Dark Lord is back (Dumbledore knows stuff and order meetings start earlier than canon), knowing that people close to him could die, and realizes that learning is less about living up to others expectations and more about surviving what's to come. It basically scares him straight. At the beginning of third year, he approaches Hermione, eats some humble pie, and asks for help. Thus, bookish Ron that's friends with Hermione.

Does that logic track?

The annoying thing is, if the story was written from Harry's PoV, I would have no issues putting that whole back story into a few conversations between Harry, Ron, and Hermione. But it's harder from Snape's PoV, because he doesn't really care about teen drama.

And of course, this wouldn't be the only change. Some of it will be easy to work in (why the Dark Lord looks mostly human is obviously because he used the diary to come back), some bits probably don't matter (Umbridge never taught DADA), but other stuff (dealing with Horcruxes and other things Dumbledore never tells Snape about) is going to be harder.

****** It could work. But what happened to the Diary Riddle?

Was he working for Voldemort or sabotaging his older self?

I've a hard time to believe that he would serve or share power with anyone, even if that anyone was another copy of him.

******* Diary Riddle provided the body, the Dark Lord possessed himself, essentially, and merged with the Horcrux. Because yes he can feel remorse if he really really tries. Also, Myrtle's death was a legitimate accident, and he botched the making of that Horcrux because it was his first go, and it was rushed because he was using a death he hadn't planned. My headcanon has always been that the diary was so much more sentient than the others because the Dark Lord massed up when he created it and actually shoved half of his soul into the diary rather than just a small piece of his soul like the rest of the horcruxes. The also explains why Diary Riddle was more sane than the Dark Lord; the horcrux actually had more of the Dark Lord's soul than the Dark Lord himself. So technically, the soul in the Horcrux was able to feel remorse and merged with the smaller bit of soul that was possessing Quirrell, that could also kinda feel remorse for what he had become.

Uh, this is actually one of those things that is not exactly relevant to the story (all that matters in that the Dark Lord is human looking and slightly more sane, and this has something to do with the diary), but readers would probably ask the same question, and Snape wouldn't be able to explain it because he wouldn't know the details of the Horcruxes, lol.

******** Then Voldemort suddenly felt much better, and decided to reintegrate all of his horcruxes, until he got to the cave....

This Voldemort would be significantly different though, more powerful, more intelligent, more sane, but far more dangerous. His goal might also deviate from the misguided blood purity and become more like Grindelwald's 'Magicals Above All'. He would have a good chance to win.

********* Yeah, pretty much. Not quite to that extreme, but yes. His goals are more defined, the raids are less random and more targeted, he is using some of his followers to push things through the government as well as using bribery and blackmail and fear. I'm still working on the details for how I'm dealing with the rest of the Horcruxes, lol. An entire binder of notes and timelines and family trees and research and I may be a little OCD.

*********** Well, speaking from Snape's perspective, he finds it very unsettling. But generally, his followers both fear and respect him enough that it wasn't an issue. If fact, it was just more proof of his power, proof that he truly is immortal. Anyone that questioned his identity at his return was quickly disabused of that notion, and most of the new recruits learn that young does not equal weak or foolish when it comes to the Dark Lord.

****** Hmm ... well, by itself it does make a bit of sense. But if I were to nitpick---and I presume you want me to do that because better be harsher earlier on than lost later---then that could serve as a reason for Ron to try doing something in memory of his sister but that does not necessarily translate to actually reading, and as his second year (with Lockhart and his many books and his uselessness) still happens he still has a potential reason to dislike them as a means of getting somewhere. The bit about Hermione, sure, I can accept, but her whole thing was more about studying with books being just means of getting that done rather than about the books themselves (though she did hold them in general in high regard, that much is true).

With that in mind, I'll say that it /would/ work if something made Ron think more positively about books earlier on, without making him more motivated outright, and then his motivation after Ginny's death resulted in him capitalising on this. The next paragraph is thus going to be a “Kazeto is rambling but there might be something useful in this rubbish” one.

So, the things you have all stem from lack of Harry. With no Harry in that compartment, maybe Ron would have gone further, or maybe he would have stopped there and maybe someone else would have sat there too, the way Ron had in the original story. Considering that most people are already seated, let's say that Ron did stop there, and nobody sat there with him; there is no Malfoy coming to taunt him because there is no rumour that “Harry Potter is on the train”, and likewise there is no mocking of his ability with spells from Hermione because with she only did it as a result of Ron trying to cast a spell to show it to Harry. Thus, he arrives to Hogwarts only knowing of Hermione that she'd tried to help another kid (whatever) rather than being a smart-arse who told him that his spell was wrong. He still gets sorted into Gryffindor (damned if you do, damned if you don't), as does Hermione. With Harry not being there he does not run into as much trouble as he originally had, and whoever he decides to mouth off to about Hermione being annoying, it's farther away from her because he's not talking to Harry who (in)conveniently happens to be there. Thus, the troll incident passes through with no danger to Hermione. But once they do get to the common room she does start talking about trolls because she has to show off her knowledge, and it is then that he tells her about how annoying she is. She escapes to her own dorm, but because there is no danger she simply cries alone, whilst other girls chew into him for being a pillock. The next day he apologises (since he'd proven in the later books that he can apologise for the mistakes he makes), and though they are not exactly friends the way they were, as far as Hermione sees it they kind of count that way, for as long as she doesn't nag him. Then comes the Mirror of Erised incident, with Ron losing something or whatever other excuse you could use, wandering out of the gryffindor dormitories at night with Hermione in tow because she wants to be of help, and finding the Mirror of Erised. She figures it out and tries to ask what he got so that she'd know what is it that he wants, figures out after a few days that he wants to get out of the shadow of his brothers, and suggests that since none of his brothers were accomplished in anything involving books then maybe that would help him. He discards it, obviously, because he's kind of given up by that point, and he tries to discard all the times in the next few years where Hermione's books proved to be helpful, but once Ginny dies it all returns to that question and with this being the one suggestion he has he decides to push in that direction, swallows /that/ piece of humble pie, and goes to Hermione to learn how to like books too.

If you decide that you like this rubbish then just say and I'll try to pick whatever could be good clues for the audience from Snape's perspective; and if not, well, happens, I'm not pretending that my ramblings are anything close to perfect.
