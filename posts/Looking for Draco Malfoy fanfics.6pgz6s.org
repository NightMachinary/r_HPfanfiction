I want to read fanfics close to canon, but with Draco having a bigger role than he had in the books. He can be allie or foe.


** I'll offer you two:

Marked: The summer after Fifth Year, from Draco's point of view: [[http://archive.hpfanfictalk.com/viewstory.php?sid=231]]

Detox: Draco's post-war recovery story: [[http://archive.hpfanfictalk.com/viewstory.php?sid=290]]

** Exile could be considered canon compliant but it doesn't take place during the books at all.
