:END:
I remember that Harry was missing an arm (or at least his forearm), I think. I know he was battle worn.

The Dursley portrait was on one wall with an armchair facing it that Harry sat in. And the wall behind the armchair had portraits of Hogwarts, the Burrow, and maybe Godrics Hollow (maybe more as well?). As well as portraits of all of Harry's friends and Family. The idea being that Harry would die in the chair and the Dursley's would have to see his body decay while also watching he and his friend live happily and comfortably in the portrait world behind the chair.

From what I remember, the war was lost and Harry had created this room to be with his family in some capacity while still giving the Dursley's their cumupance.


** Only one I know of that rings a bell is Paint by Numbers by Wheezy1, I know there is a portrait trapping part but been years since I read it.
