So far my favorite fics have been the Arithmancer series (arithmancy is basically magic physics, and Hermione is good at it) and I also really liked some aspects of HPMoR (experimenting with magic) because of the magic/science theme.

Any suggestions for other fics with a similar theme?


** The best I can think of at the moment is linkffn(Blindness), which has nice magical theory and lots of experimenting with it. The story's completed, which is always a plus, though personally I dropped it some time before the end --- not because of a quality drop, mind you (though I feel like the story gets a big bogged down with its vampires plotline), but because of a matter of morals. The story reveals its version of the Afterlife in the end, and Harry thinks it's wonderful while I thought it nightmarish, and I just couldn't keep following him after that. But if you have a higher tolerance than me for that kind of thing, /Blindness/ is definitely for you.

linkffn(Core Threads) is another story in the same general mould, but sillier, nicer, and unfortunately-incomplete. Less "sciencey" for a while, but again, lots of creative fanonical magic-theory.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
