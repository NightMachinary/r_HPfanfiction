something that would fit in with the fetish called freeuse or something like that


** Ugh why am I admitting I have read part of this rubbish, linkffn(The Free Use Experience by Vance McGill). It opens with incest and descends into some insane political lunacy to justify the plot, somehow the incest was more palatable and that was enough for me.

*** The smut is superb (never had any siblings, so the incest part doesn't really affect me), especially the metamorphic gender swap part later on, but everything around it is highly questionable. It would have been so much better as "Hogwarts Sex club" where everyone is just shagging everyone else for the fun of it.

Still, the rather dystopian laws are still one step above the highly popular marriage law stories.

  In a world where Harry and his twin sister are the Twins-Who-Lived, and their parents survived that Halloween night, there is a sexual social experiment at Hogwarts known as the Free Use Experience. Harry/Hermione/OFC/Multi; Sibling Incest; Mild Dumbledore/Snape/Ron bashing; Rated M for lots of lemons! Longer summary and many warnings inside. This story is not for prudes!

***** The fetish of Freeuse isn't really about polyamory, but the overt sexual objectification of women. The idea is that any man can /use/ any woman whenever he wants because the woman has no personhood where sexuality is concerned.

That's the kink.

It's a more extreme depiction of some of the values depicted in Harem fics.

***** Not what I recall, but I'll at least have a look, so thanks. No, what I recall was more like a Second or Third Year fic, magicals mature faster +for reasons+, for some reason Harry missed the memo about magical maturation which mentions that masturbation is not only not a bad thing, but a very healthy thing to do, which is part of the whole 'wizards and witches have to orgasm or their magical can be harmful' the first commentor was on about, and the Chasers 'help him out' about it, which leads to the whole 'glowing' part I mentioned. Now that I'm off work and home, I'll see if I can find it.
