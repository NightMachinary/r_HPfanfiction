#+begin_quote
  With the Triwizard Tournament on the horizon, Sebastien Delacour hires a bodyguard from an infamous program to protect his daughter. Behind silver sunglasses, the boy with dead eyes watches. The girl's enemies, a small problem. The man with five names, a small problem. The Dark Lord, a slighly larger problem. But his charge seeing through his facade, now that's a real problem.

*** sadly not. I have read that one too. The one I am looking for has most likely been deleted which is very frustrating as it was a good fic.

** Is it the one where Harry has a “Dark Knight” thing that's like a manifestation of his anger, or the one where Harry is a water elemental and theres chapter or two where he's been hired to defend Fleur and her family. There's a couple other bodyguard fics where he is hired by the Delacours (however it's spelt) but can't remember them.

Edit: did a quick search for The French Connection and there was a reddit post where it was linked and it has in fact been deleted whata shame.
