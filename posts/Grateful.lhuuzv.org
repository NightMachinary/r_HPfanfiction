So in October/November, I was at the worst point of my life yet. I got diagnosed with Depression and went through some major shit, could only get out of bed for therapy but not for everything else, even if I tried. Nothing made me feel good, I could not get myself to do anything. The only thing I did was scroll through Social Media apps non-stop. I felt like I had completely lost myself. And then I rediscovered my love for Harry Potter and writing. I was always a Harry Potter Fan, but my god diving back into my old favourite franchise and the universe helped me distract myself from my terrible and helpless thoughts. When I was younger I used to write a lot but my teacher at the time completely took my passion away. By accident or chance, I rediscovered my old Wattpad account and all the inspiration came shooting back, and I started writing my Harry Potter Story "Diffindo".

When I first started writing I could not get myself to stop. I started at 6 pm and wrote until 2 am without a break. It was the first time in months I felt passionate about something and I actually felt like I had a reason. I wrote the story for myself, but a friend convinced me to post it on Wattpad, and so I did, and now it has over 1.5k reads. I'm so passionate about my story and the characters and I want to keep creating.

So thank you, Harry Potter and creative writing for bringing back some joy into my life. I'm writing this while crying, I know soooo cheesy, but I am just so incredibly grateful and honestly, I do not know where I'd be if I had not rediscovered my love for it all.

Thank you.
