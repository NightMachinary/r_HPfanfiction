I'm pretty sure it was a kind of bad dark!Hermione fic, where Hermione was in a fairly explicit relationship with Tom Riddle, but also had a thing going with Abraxas. It was a longer fiction, and I'm only 60% sure I read it on FF.net.

It was the first dark!Hermione fic I'd read, and I'd like to read it again, but for the life of me I just can't find it.

*** It was a really weird fic. Probably written worse than I remember, since it was one of the first fanfictions I've ever read.
