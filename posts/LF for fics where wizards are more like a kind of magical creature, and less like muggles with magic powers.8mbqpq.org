While I didn't enjoy everything about the Son of the Firebird, one of the things I did enjoy about it was it's unique take on wizarding biology/psychology/magic. Wizards weren't just magical muggles, but were clearly magical creatures with distinct, creature-ish biology and magic, and even 'predators' (like Veela) uniquely suited to take advantage of weak-points in that biology/magic.

I'm looking for stories where, like in Son of the Firebird, wizards and witches are different from muggles in qualitative ways, stories where wizards really do seem to be part of the magical ecosystem of the canon (or fanon) world, and aren't just super-powered muggles elevated above it. Anyone know any stories like that?

Bonus points if the wizards in the fic don't actually dominate the magical world, and are actually on more equal footing with the other sentient races. (Whether this is done by nerfing wizards or buffing other sentients doesn't matter to me, but buffing the other sentients would be more interesting: maybe stories where centaur divination is as overpowered as wand magic?)


** You may be interested to know that as of Fantastic Beasts, this is explicitly canon:

  "You see, you're a muggle, so our physiologies are subtly different."

Of course, it was always implied (longer lifespan, not dying when hit by bludgers to the face, resistance to non-magical poisons) but nice to have confirmation that it is a kind of "magical physiology" and not just, say, accidental magic.
