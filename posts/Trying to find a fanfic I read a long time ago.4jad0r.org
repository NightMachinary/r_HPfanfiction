** Really not a lot to go on. Do you remember anything else? Ships, bits of dialogue, other scenes?

** Hey! How cool is that? I also found this fic thinking it was a leaked official 7th book. It has the 'try to lure Voldemort to the veil'. But there's no heir of Gryffindor.

  Harry has to decide who to trust as he moves closer to fulfilling his destiny. Will he be able to find and destroy all the Horcruxes? And at what price? Will he be able to find the strength within himself? And...can he do it and still get the girl
