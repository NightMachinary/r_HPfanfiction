** It'd help if you described what that fic was like. Specifically what you enjoyed about it, that you'd want to see in a fic we would recommend.

  Stripped of his humanity, Logan became Weapon X. When the doctors were through; he was little more than a remote controlled beast guided by base instinct. In contrast, Harry became Weapon IX and was stripped of his human trappings. Care, love, and compassion were torn from him, creating a superb machine who kills without remorse. Is that all they will ever be?
