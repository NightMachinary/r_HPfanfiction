So stuff like Harry /and/ Dumbledore both manipulating others for the Greater Good, Dumbledore mentoring and teaching Harry the subtleties of politics, rhetoric, and shady warfare tactics, or manipulative!Dumbledore's utilitarianism being portrayed by the narrative as a genuinely right choice (with Harry's agreement). Bonus points for Dumbledore unironically teaching Harry dark and vicious pieces of Dark Magic, or showing him how to mess with others' minds using Mind Magic.

*** And later on in the book (with the help of Felix Felicis, of course) Harry pulls on all the right strings to get Slughorn to give him the real memory of when he and Riddle discussed horcruxes.

That could actually be an interesting jumping-off point; Dumbledore did give him that assignment on purpose in canon. You could frame it all as Dumbledore belatedly trying to teach him that the fight ahead won't all be a headlong rush to sling Expelliarmus around; he thought he'd be there to do what needed to be done behind the scenes for Harry, but now he's faced with death in less than a year.

** Dumbledore notices Harry is just in the perfect position to succeed him(well connected, famous as a problem solver, magically powerful, reasonably good morals) so trains him not only in magical matters but political as well.

​

"But Professor, we know that it was Lucius that gave the diary to Ginny, why can't we have him arrested?"

Dumbledore peered at Harry with an amused glint in his eyes.

"And how would we go about doing that, Harry?"

The question was given respectfully, but Harry thought the undertone was the same when children asked stupid things from their parents and they humored them.

"Well-We, gather the evidence, the witnesses and give them to the DMLE, you said Madam Bones was fair, and not corruptable"

At the Headmaster's raised eyebrow Harry continued with a flush on his cheeks.

"We also try to...frame it in a way that would paint only Lucius in a bad light, and not the Ministry itself"

Dumbledore nodded with an indulgent smile.

"Well proposed Harry, a proposition that would work, most of the time, now, I want you to think it over, think about all the information you know about the Ministry, Lucius and DMLE and tell me why it wouldn't work, or rather how it could backfire horribly on those who are blameless"

Harry scrunched his eyebrows in thought, even if he had been practicing masking his emotions with a pleasant and calm demeanor, he felt comfortable in not doing it with Dumbledore. He reviewed all he had read and heard about those three, all he had gleaned from Draco's ramblings, both those willingly given and those goaded out from him.

"It wouldn't stick, right? He would just throw the blame to another?"

There was a small nod "And to who in this case Harry?"

Who was the weakest side? "Ginny"

Another smile and nod "And how would that happen? Your best guess"

Harry thought for a few moments before slumping in his chair. "Lucius would just create reasonable doubt, he may not be able to influence the DMLE but he could influence Fudge to muddy the waters, and then he would try and throw the blame at Ginny, and the Weasleys wouldn't be able to take the heat, and he would bribe those he couldn't convince, he could claim Arthur had seized the diary during a raid and Ginny got it because it was neglected, he could claim it was stolen, he could even deny any connection to it or claim a compulsion charm was at work, that he was just another victim."

"And what would be the common result among all of those."

"Ginny would get the blame for the attacks, and the Weasleys would be ruined, along with her"

"And who would benefit from this besides Lucius? Would this outcome give any benefit to our cause, at all?"

Harry shook his head, even after nearly two years of instruction, he still had some moments when his knee jerk reaction of doing the lawful thing came to the forefront"

"No, it wouldn't, in the end, people would forget who gave the diary and focus on who used it"

"And knowing this, how could /we/ benefit from this situation and all we gained from it?"

Harry thought for a few moments "Well, apart from what we learned, about Riddle, and the diary, we can still hold it against Lucius, this is further proof he served Voldemort, if he slips up again we can add this to whatever he does, and..."

Another raised eyebrow.

"I don't think Voldermort meant for Lucius to use the diary in this way, if he had succeeded it would be one thing, but he failed, and the diary was destroyed, I don't think Tom will be happy once he learns of it"

"Very Good, we have to count the small blessings" Dumbledore looked at the clock "Now, we can review your actions in this incident later, it's getting late, and I don't want you to rely on that wonderful cloak of yours too much, now before you go, how go your forays in the house of Slytherin?"

Harry smiled at that, a smile eerily reminiscent of the one James had when he was playing one his pranks, though now there was an edge to it that was not innocent at all.

"Well, Sir, speaking parseltongue opens more doors than just those of the Chamber"

"Oh?"

"I managed to gain the trust of Nott and Zabini, and Dap-Greengrass and Davies were already in out of their disdain for Malfoy and his prejudices, now I have earned their respect as well."

Dumbledore gave another smile, a proud one "Excellent, though I am curious, I thought Mr. Nott was on Malfoy's side and that Mr. Zabini's plan was to remain neutral, how did you went about convincing them"

"Well, sir, as you said, some of Voldemort's supporters didn't enjoy having to grovel at his feet, so what I did was show them that it was better to serve in the light than be a slave in the darkness, Nott was quite eager to be given an option other than having to kiss some 'inbred half-blood son of a squib"'s feet, and from what he told me, many of his father's 'friends' are quite enjoying living in luxury to risk it all for an insane man with a penchant for torturing his own followers" Harry now grinned "It's as you always say, sir, a man's treasure is where his heart is"

"Very good Harry, and what about Mr. Zabini, the last I heard he is external to all of this"

Harry nodded "He knows this is temporary, he can see where things are going, and he wants to go to the winning side."

"And I can assume you showed him that side was ours, or rather yours?"

"It wasn't that hard, Slytherins flock around power, and I showed them we had most of it at the moment, now all I have to do is make it so they can't change sides if that ever seems unclear"

"Good, Good, Harry, I see that you're learning, your alliances in the other houses are flourishing too, and that's good, but if we manage to influence Slytherin enough, we will be removing a significant part of Tom's future powerbase, your efforts have borne fruit, despite all the difficulties this year, I am very proud of you"

Harry beamed "Thank you, sir, it's all thanks to your teachings"

Dumbledore smiled again, softer and kinder this time "And what about Miss Greengrass and Miss Davies" apparently he hadn't forgotten his slip, and Harry flushed, before carefully trying for a neutral expression.

"W-Well, we get on rather well, they are not well seen by some in their house because of Davies blood status, so we got on common ground in trying to change the situation, and Greengrass, like Zabini, can see that remaining neutral will not be an option, and Greengrass comes from a respected family and knows a lot about the other families and their alliances so I thou-"

He stopped at his teacher's raised hand, but got a sense of relief at his soft gaze.

"Harry, I never said you couldn't make friends of them, nor that you had to treat everything as merely a tactical advantage, our life is hard as it is, there's no shame in fostering deeper bonds of friendship" and here there was an amused glint in his eyes "or more" with a chuckle at Harry's blush and murmured denials he continued "I was twelve once too, just please, be careful with who do you give your trust"

Harry nodded, determined "I understand, sir, I always am"

"Good, you can go know, we shall meet next Saturday, and remember all we do..."

"Is for the Greater Good" Harry completed with a smile as he rose from the chair and went for the door.

"And Harry" the boy in question stopped at the door "This doesn't mean we can't enjoy ourselves while doing it"

And with a skip to his step, Harry went back to the Gryffindor Tower, already thinking of how to approach Justin, Ernie and Susan tomorrow to try and cash in some of the goodwill from having his name cleared while guilt-tripping them over their past distrust.

Albus steepled his fingers and smiled to himself, it was all going according to plan, even Lucius interference played into their hand, now Harry had even more tools to garner support among students along with new ways to interact with the house of Slytherin, where he may have found his very own Minerva.
