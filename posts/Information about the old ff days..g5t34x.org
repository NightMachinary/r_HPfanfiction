Hey y'all, so I'm currently writing a freeform essay for my English class (HS senior) and I wanted to touch on some of the drama I know went down in the Harry Potter fandom during the early 2000s. (Like Cassandra Cla(i)re, plagiarism)

I was curious if anyone has any stories or knows of any good sources I could look for info about this. I was but a twinkle in my father's eye back then so anything helps really.

*** Thank you!!

I've heard the msscribe drama mentioned before in my post from yesterday. It's rather facinating to take a step back and really get a good look on how internet and ff culture has developed over the years!

Thank you again, I wouldn't have found that web archive link without you!

*** Crazy stuff! I didn't know Cassandra Claire was one of the "Inner Circle" or even that there was one lol. Lots of interesting fandom history - thanks for sharing!

** If you search on [[/r/hobbydrama][r/hobbydrama]] for Harry Potter there's a few good write-ups for HP and general YA fiction / fanfiction writers as well if you wanted to expand at all.

** You should definitely check out the youtube video "Msscribe: The Harry Potter Fandom's Greatest Con-Artist - When Posting Goes Wrong" by Eldena Doubleca5t. It goes over the Ms. Scribe incident in a lot of detail (it's about an hour long, which I enjoy greatly, but if you don't care for long videos then you could just put it on 1.25 or 1.5 speed). It's not a primary resource obviously, but it gave me a good understanding of the whole thing, and has plenty of screenshots and such of the drama. Hopefully that's helpful!

** You cannot forget The Shipping Wars! [[https://angua9.livejournal.com/204545.html]] delivers well the spirit of that time, I think (and if divided by twenty, at least, it is still actually good criticism of the Harmony stories).
