*Warning: May or may not contain Mugglewank™

--------------

The Squibs, tired of the treatment they receive from their Magical families, bitter and resentful at their lack of "it", decide that if they can't get Magic, /nobody will/.

How they do it, I don't quite mind (Thus, possible Mugglewank™), but I'm looking for fics where basically Squibs cut the Magicals' access to Magic.

Or maybe they manage to delete Magic itself.

#+begin_quote
  It's the day of the First Task of the Tri-Wizard Tournament, and the last people that Harry ever expected to be there to see him before he was to face the dragon was the Dursleys, or even the other revelations that would be revealed. H/Hr. Some Draco bashing.

** In NoahPhantom's Albus Potter series squibs are for a while major antagonists who call themselves the Sandbloods and plan to eradicate all wizards with use of magic disruptive technology and some enslavement potion similar to the Imperius Curse. However I didn't enjoy those scenes very much since they play out like a spy action movie.
