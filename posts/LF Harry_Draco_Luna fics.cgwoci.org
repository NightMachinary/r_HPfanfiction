I enjoy reading both Drarry and Harry/Luna and have seen many polyamorous and harem fics. I have recently wondered about fics where Harry/Draco/Luna are all in a romantic relationship together but can't seem to find many fics with this grouping. Do you guys know of any Harry/Draco/Luna fics? Well written fics that are finished or actively being worked on would be even better.

  A traumatised war hero and a convicted criminal under the roof of an eccentric journalist make for a rather odd ensemble, but Luna has never had a problem with oddities as long as they make sense.
