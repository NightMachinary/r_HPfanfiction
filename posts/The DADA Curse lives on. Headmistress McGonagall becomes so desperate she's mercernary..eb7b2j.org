Wherein someone actually takes advantage of the fact that anyone filling the position might die.

Hire a Norwegian to sucker random (or not-so-random handpicked) Joes into a fiscally promising position at a school. OH, but it's not a physical fitness slash dueling class in a local Norwegian school like you thought it was, LOL; the contract you just signed pertains to the defence class at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry! What an idiot foreigner you are!

If what's-his-face manages to live through the experience, he'll be financially set for life. If he gets arrested for some scandal or whatever, that money will be waiting for him while he waits out his sentence. (Cycle the funds back into Hogwarts if his detainment becomes a status of permanence.) If he loses his mind and/or his limbs, a significant portion (if not all) of the money will go toward hospice bills, and he will live in comfort for the (potentially limited) rest of his days. ... Unless and until someone pulls the plug. If he outright dies, the money goes to his family/loved ones and/or a charity of his choosing. Or... Not. That fine print sure is tiny. Heheh.

Maybe a criminal pays community service and receives a formal pardon as a reward. Maybe a blackmail-ee gets revenge on his blackmailer. Maybe a stiffed lover decides to go all in and give his or her ex something to feel guilty about by signing on as the DADA proff. Either way, it gets sold as a position to benefit from... when cast in a certain (morbidly intriguing) light.


** I dig it. There are always desperate people who need money, you wouldn't even need to trick them with the fine print.

** Just...get rid of the class. Start a new class called Defense against Dark Wizards or just Magical Defense.

*** Assume for the purposes of this prompt that a rebranding of the class name or structure does not impact the defense class curse. This is at least partly the reason why every attempt to restart and maintain a new dueling club fails.

(The 'Dark Arts', after all, is something of an ambiguous title and it is perpetually open to interpretation from each individual perspective in a continuously changing body of governmental overseers. Lawful permissions change all the time, so the curse has to cover any and every manner of protection that is - and may, in future, become - considered an objective example of protection of one's self or peers from one or more unleashed 'Dark Arts'. If the goal is meant to be maiming or destroying, surely the method employed in order to do so is 'Dark'. Therefore: any form of shielding, dodging, countering, or offensive sparring/brawling/duelling techniques taught for utilization against any and all humans, creatures, spells, or items /of/ or items imbued /with/ any types of magic, which acts for the purpose of or is wielded for the sake of harming, /might/ be considered as 'Defence Against the Dark Arts'. So, really: any and all manner of self-defense could fall under the broad purview of Mr. Riddle's disruptive curse.)

Assume, also, that only a small percentage of students' families are financially capable of hiring personal tutors outside of Hogwarts and that, for that reason, the mortality rate among the younger generation has risen drastically; despite (or perhaps because of) the fact that the war against Dark Lord Voldemort is over. (Complacency, and all that.) Assume that getting rid of any semblance of defense class in this extremely prestigious school would raise that rate even higher, and perhaps play a large hand in ruining Wizarding Britain's economy. *((Enter New Dark Lord.))*

Assume that having the staff of Hogwarts itself source out third-party tutoring would bankrupt them (because enabling greedy people to be greedy under the guise of being concerned for peoples' safety, and funding traveling expenses for multiple two-way trips for up to 280 students plus chaperones throughout the span of two full school terms for who-knows-how-many-years would honestly wind up costing more than what it would take to offer a single, annual, expensive bribe to troubled or oblivious randos).

Assume that the racism against poor muggleborns would get even worse as a direct result of nixing a defense curriculum altogether because what is the point of getting to know or siding with a person belonging to an endangered (if large) ethnicity who may not live for much longer anyway. *((Enter New Dark Lord.))*

Assume that the student-led defense club loophole has only varying degrees of success (because children) and never lasts for longer than a single term or only lasts just short of a single year, and is by no means a successive practice as a result.

In a nutshell: Assume that any semblance of an organized defense teaching at Hogwarts, period, remains a cursed position-slash-endeavor, but that tossing it out completely might - no, would /certainly/ - aid in the effort of another evil social reformist nut. And Wizarding Britain is still in recovery from the /'last'/ war.

So: "If you can't beat it, exploit it!"
