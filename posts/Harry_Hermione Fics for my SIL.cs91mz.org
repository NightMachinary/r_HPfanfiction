Hi all! I'm on here for the sake of my SIL who will be quarantined and going through radiation after removal of her cancerous thyroid(3-7 days treatment) unable to touch anyone or see anyone (her hubby for only an hour!). Her favorite thing in the world is Harry Potter and she always wanted Harry and Hermione to end up together, but she's never read fan fiction. She's also pretty conservative and she doesn't like anything tooooo romancey. Romance would be fine, if there were some good, storytelling elements.

I'm coming to you, Reddit, because although I love HP fic, I'm a Drarry girl, so I have no idea what the good fics are for Harry/Hermione! I searched and found a few that a bunch of people seemed to like ( Time is Fire, Shadow Walk). My intention was to read them and preview them, but GOOD LORD. They are so long.

Anyway, she is already anxious about the whole thing, and a total feeler, so being locked away in a room by herself getting cancer treatment is freaking her out(That and the fact that her mom died of cancer when she was young). I wanted to give her something that could help her escape into her favorite world, but give her new stories to enjoy. Thanks, everyone!


** [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700][Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire]]

This is pretty close to canon, with the point of divergence being Hermione deciding to cast a charm that will let her know if Harry comes to grievous bodily harm over the summer. This causes the Goblet of Fire to replace Harry's name with hers. There are ripple effects and they do eventually start dating, but they remain awkward teenagers and the romance remains mostly in their heads for most of the story.

** But not /too much/ romance... hmmm.

Well, we can try.

linkffn(The Strange Disappearance of SallyAnne Perks)

linkffn(5578899)

linkffn(10276824)

Not all of them need to be romances, surely?

  Hermione joins Harry and Viktor by the forest, right before they run into a deranged Mr. Crouch. Now Hermione has to solve a puzzle, save a madman, and duel an invisible Death Eater - and somehow stay alive. Oneshot, set in GoF, Hermione-centric, HHr.

#+begin_quote
  [COMPLETE] Harry has been entered in the Triwizard Tournament, but during the shouting match with Ron he realises that he doesn't actually have to risk his life and look like a fool in front of everyone - he really only needs to show up for each task and make a token effort. Single-point-of-departure fic, departing early in book 4. Some text borrowed from J.K. Rowling.

  Harry raised his head from the book he was reading, snugly sat on top of his bunk, at the topmost floor of Ravenclaw Tower. Right in front of him, he saw himself. And that was only the least strange thing that would happen on that day...

They definitely don't need to all be romances. Thank you very much!

** Maybe she could try linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief by StarFox5). It's an extensive AU, where Hermione is expelled in her 2nd year for a crime she didn't commit, and she swears to get her revenge. It's a long one, very heavy on the action. It is Harry/Hermione, but it's very much a slow burn, and it doesn't overstay its welcome.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
