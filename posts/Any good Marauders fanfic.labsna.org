No Wolfstar, just plain old Marauder fun, plus Remus's furry little problem. Maybe some encounters with Snape, school fun. I've read Against The Moon, and a few others I forgot the name of. Just one story that covers all seven years.


** linkao3(All The Young Dudes) is the best one for character development and just generally a great story but it is Wolfstar. Not smutty or anything. Remus and Sirius have truly brilliant characterisations and tracks 1st year to OoTP. But if it's not your thing then fine. I havent read a 7 year Marauders story that comes close to it ever.

linkffn(The Life and Times) is a good Marauder Era fic? I really enjoyed it but only covers 6th year.

TheDivineComedian does some brilliant Remus and Sirius stories. Not Wolfstar (It might be assumed for one or two stories but never relevant or mentioned). They are really good at just Black family stuff or getting into Remus's head. linkao3(Blackpool). Marie Kavanagh on Ao3 as well does some brilliant Sirius focussed stories.

  It's the day before a big Quidditch game, and James is acting very strangely. Could it be a Slytherin curse? And can the other Marauders help?
