So yea, title says it I guess. While trying to fight the blockade I have on my main story, I wrote over 10 other story-starts that are 1 to 3 chapters long. Now that I have them on my harddrive, I feel like its a waste to let them rot there.

My idea would be something along the line of what Rorschachs Blot did, but I'm unsure in how many people would be interested in that. What do you think?


** As you said, it would be waste to let them rot. Post them, and let the site's viewers decide if they're interested. You've already done all the work anyways.

** I don't see why not. Many writers on FF.net have an entry for 1-3-shot chapters.
