Looking for a past fic I read probably 5+ years ago on mugglenet. It was one of the very first ones I read. It had a house elf named Jarvy and Haryy goes from the Dursleys to the Burrow and there is some type of book, I think, that acts like a gateway to a home of Harry's. That's about all I remember.

  Dumbledore is gone, or is he? Harry feels the weight of the world rests on his shoulders. His brooding nature and desire to face his fate alone may be his greatest weakness. It is his capacity for emotion that makes him strong, his relationships his greatest strength. Who is he really? Can Harry become the wizard he needs to be to face the Dark Lord?
