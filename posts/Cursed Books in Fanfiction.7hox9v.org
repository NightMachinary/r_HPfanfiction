What do you think are the limits of Cursed books in the Harry Potter world?

In Canon Sonnets of a Sorcerer was a book which cursed anyone who read it. They would speak in limericks for the rest of their lives. If someone were to use A cursed Book With the parameter that if you read it would will walk Silently for the rest of your Life (Provided it didn't go wrong and make so the person could not talk and walk at the same time)Do you think it would:

Magically Silence you as you walk

or

would it make it so that your body Physically walks Silently?

Could someone use Cursed Books to Create something like video game Skill Books in the Harry potter world?

If you could make a Cursed Book with Positive effects what would you have the book do?


** Cursed books can be used to kill somebody. Just put the withering curse from the Ring on it or the one from the necklace. Or soak an invisible poison into the pages.

As for "buffing" people, this would be difficult to explain because you can't simply say "read this and gain transfiguration +5". Magic in Harry Potter has no levels, you learn individual spells. Therefore a book that teaches you a spell is a simple spellbook. You could put a supersensory charm or similar on a book but wouldn't ot be more effective to simply charm the person? The only thing coming close to the concept of buffs is the luck potion.

That said if you really want a video game style system, there was an ASOIAF fanfic in which Jon Snow found a magical bracelet that allowed him to see a HUD and gave him an overview about his stats, quests and information on people. He found out about Cersei's incest that way. My main criticism for that concept is how the author handled combat, with fixed damage values and critical hits instead of a "internal Module" system similar to War Thunder. It has a terrible reading flow.

*** I wasn't thinking about using it to learn magic threw the books I was more thinking about Physical actions that a wizard might be to lazy to learn the muggle way.

For learning magic I would think of maybe you could curse a really boring theory book so that the reader would remember everything written in the book so you only had to read it once. and maybe add a cures so that once you start reading it the reader could not stop till they are finish.

**** What counts as reading it? Do you have to read it from start to end every time you see the title on the spine? Because that would be a good /cursed/ book.

***** I would Assume reading the first page would trigger the curse because if reading the spine or front cover set off the curse it would be a bit hard to sell them.

****** You sell it in a paper bag or with something covering the text, or with a dust jacket that isn't cursed.
