What if “electronics don't work at Hogwarts” is because there is an overwhelming amount of magic? Has anyone done the opposite? Where MAGIC doesn't work in the muggle world because of all the electronics?

Could be interesting.


** Maybe instead of electricity, Radio Waves. Like 4G, satellites, etc.

Those are things becoming more and more prevalent so it could be a futuristic fic where the amount of radio waves start to affect Diagon Alley

*** Alright, if we want the play with the physics, radio is a fluctuation in the electromagnetic field (just like light, just a lower frequency).

Now, we know that the Wizarding Wireless works in high magic areas, because we see it at Hogwarts. The first explanation for that is that magic doesn't interfere with the EM spectrum (which also means that the Wizarding Wireless is a potential breech of the statute, as Muggles tend to pay attention to strange radio broadcasts).

The other way to look at that is that magic somehow interacts with the EM field causing interference, which means that the Wizarding Wireless must somehow be different from regular radios. If we want to play with that, then we could also say that "wards"/"protections" are visible in infrared or radio spectrum, and those protections becoming visible is just a more excited state of those fields interacting. Having protections around a place has the sad effect that it blocks all long band radio waves, only allowing near infrared and up frequencies through.

How you want to play it is, as always, up to the author, so long as it is internally consistent.

***** This.

Magic in HP world is "I want this thing to do X" and it does it or it doesn't, depending on the caster's will, knowledge, and power. There are some esoteric ritual stuff at play according to customs, but it's basically that. You can do anything if you have enough of the above.

Making a magical radio is like making intergalactic travel work by fueling it with The Force, or making droids, or magical any kind of technology. If magic is involved, it tends to not make sense, scientifically.

**** Yes, this discussion happens quite a bit on this sub, usually in the context of "Who would win, Muggles or Wizards". I've always been in the camp that eventually muggles would win, because it is the only thing that makes the world setup make sense.

But in the past I've always fallen back on the ants vs bears. A bear can beat an ant, but if you had a billion ants in a room, the bear would be crushed to death. Plus if you consider Wizards afraid of Muggles 1000 years ago, then with the tech advances in the last couple of hundred years the power balance should be waaaaay off. (I know others disagree quite a bit :P ).

But this is an interesting alternative. Instead of it simply being muggles win by sheer numbers, you can have muggles actually have terrifying effect on wizards. Wizards hate muggleborns because they keep bringing Walkmen to Hogwarts that mess with magic. They don't understand how dangerous it is. Wizards hate moving through London because it makes their magic wonky. So much easier to simply isolate themselves.

Seems like an interesting difference.

***** I always liken it to the latter rather than the former, especially since wizarding customs seem so dated (the way they dress, for example). They saw the writing on the wall a millennia ago and slowly realized they were being out-produced, isolated themselves, and barely interact with the non-magical world such that their styles and knowledge always seem dated over the course of centuries. After all, if you could do magic, would you stick around with your non-magical friends? Would you be satisfied to be the one who has to solve every problem anyone had at any time, regardless of whether you cared for them or not? No, probably not, and magicals kept to themselves more and more over the years.

Blood purists incorrectly assumed that keeping magical blood within the ranks would usher more magical generations, but they didn't have knowledge of genetic theory or the likes, and so have spoiled their gene pool for centuries. Slytherin and his decedents being an example of taking an ideology in the wrong direction.

Muggle expansionism, their "constantly" changing nations and laws and rhetoric, is just the result and perspective a people who tend to live long, easy lives operating in an isolated society that doesn't necessarily depend on them. A wizard with half a brain can satisfy enough Maslow's hierarchy to survive, so the competitive nature integral to the success of most western societies doesn't need to exist.

So, more often than not, you get complacent wizards who aren't rational in the sense that we, being participants of a capitalist society and relying on our own understanding of the world's workings, are. Wizarding society propagates with a flawed worldview and survives (because Magic!) while the rest of the world continues to gain a better understanding of what is "most correct."

Muggles and muggle-borns threaten the blood-purist ideology and wizarding society as a whole, which is reason enough for them to defy them, but the terrifying thing (for them) is that a hundred, or a hundred thousand, could come and change the way the world works. They don't care that it is for the better of mankind of their society as a whole, it is a change in the status-quo that previously benefited them. They are used to being magical and special, against a world that is mostly not, so anything that disrupts that is considered bad.

Technology is just the result or representation of all of that. It's rapid change, and hasn't happened as quickly as it has in recent decades. We went from riding horses to having mechanical cars to having self-driving cars in about 150 years (a long lifetime for a wizard, and within the scope of memory); but it took millenia to go from discovering farming to the industrial revolution, so anyone (wizards) outside of that scope of understanding would be terrified of such rapid change.

*** The whole magic destroys electrical thing is orginally taken from canon but expanded way to far in fanon.

It all comes from two almost throw away lines by Hermione in GoF:

#+begin_quote
  "Maybe she had you bugged," said Harry.

  "Bugged?" said Ron blankly. "What. . . put fleas on her or something?"

  Harry started explaining about hidden microphones and recording equipment. Ron was fascinated, but Hermione interrupted them.

  "Aren't you two ever going to read Hogwarts, A History"

  "What's the point?" said Ron. "You know it by heart, we can just ask you."

  "All those substitutes for magic Muggles use - electricity, computers, and radar, and all those things - they all go haywire around Hogwarts, there's too much magic in the air."
#+end_quote

And later:

#+begin_quote
  Malfoy was holding his hand up to his mouth and speaking into it.

  “He looks like he's using a walkie-talkie,” said Harry curiously.

  “He can't be,” said Hermione, “I've told you, those sorts of things don't work around Hogwarts..."
#+end_quote

So, you have to ignore the evidence and take what is written in Hogwarts; a History, and refers only to Hogwarts, as truth and applicable to the entire magical world. It is very possible that Hogwarts; A History is wrong (after all the author is an extremely old recluse). Like many things in the magical world, people simply don't apply any common sense to it and just don't try it themselves (therefore never finding out it isn't true). It could also only apply to Hogwarts, but the use of alarm clocks in (book 3, chapter 9) hints that electronics /can/ be used around magic. There is also no evidence to show magic outside of these lines actually affects technology. The charmed car may have started as muggle but was 'heavily enchanted'. Diagon ally, the MoM and Kings Cross all exist in the middle of London. As someone else mentioned there are wards around number four. If tech was blown up by magic, there would be a massive 'dead zones' in the middle of London. There isn't.

**** Personally, I have come up with a number of reasons why the wizarding world seems to believe that tech doesn't work with magic.

Lightning Wards - wards designed to prevent lightning from striking magical buildings and causing fires. This causes interference with the electricity in electric devices, causing them not to work. Nobody investigates this, so they just chalk it up to magic being superior to tech.

Misinterpretation of Slang - muggle born brings portable electronic device to school (gameboy, electric clock, ect.) and because there is no outlets or batteries at Hogwarts, their device dies. They say, "Oh darn, my [insert name of device] died!" A pureblood hears this and misinterprets this to mean the permanent death of said device. Their preference for magic and fear of all things muggle leads them to proclaim to all and sundry that tech does not work with magic. Everyone just goes along with because it makes them a special little snowflake compared to those filthy muggles.

Intentional Negative Propaganda - similar to the above explanation, this suggests that at some point purebloods lied and spread the rumor that tech does not work around magic. They do this because they are afraid of what would happen if muggle borns discovered that they could have magic and science.

Harry runs away from the dursleys at a young age and lives on the streets. Dumbledore kept trying to find him and send him back, then Harry ran away again. This back and forth continued for awhile until Harry found a room that protected him, a room with a Three Phase Transformer in it. This fic takes the idea of strong magic disrupting electricity and makes the inverse true, strong electromagnetic fields (though only the ones around Three Phase Transformers) disrupt magic.

*** In the story, the electrical transformer room is first mentioned in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11341620/4/Harry-Potter-The-Boy-Who-Is-Missing][chapter 4]] (the first chapter about Harry), and the room is decided to have magic-blocking capabilities in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11341620/12/Harry-Potter-The-Boy-Who-Is-Missing][chapter 12]].

I read up to chapter 12, but I don't recommend the story. Everything goes too smoothly for Harry, as if Harry were a Gary Stu. Despite having lived on the streets and not practiced social skills, Harry quickly makes friends. Harry thinks up a new way to learn magic that no one else has thought of and learns magic 10 times faster than anyone else, and even when others try it he is naturally better at it. And Harry keeps jumping to conclusions about Dumbledore and how he should solved his problems based on things that the readers know about the magic world but that Harry shouldn't know yet.

Another category of problems with the story is that every adult except Dumbledore sides with Harry as soon as they hear of his problems. Teachers jump to the conclusion to help Harry before they have even heard all of the facts of the situation. For example, in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11341620/11/Harry-Potter-The-Boy-Who-Is-Missing][chapter 11]], Flitwick breaks up some bullies trying to talk to Hermione and Luna, saying “Ladies! I think I've heard enough!” But though we know they were about to bully Hermione and Luna, they hadn't actually said anything bully-like yet. The author just jumps ahead to the part where Flitwick is on the heroes' side because that was their plan for the story. The story isn't what would actually follow from the events described.
