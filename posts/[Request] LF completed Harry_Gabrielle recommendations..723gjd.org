**** I didn't know that. I personally like Jeconais' works a lot but I can see why people dislike his style.

***** I'm being moderately unfair. I'd never argue that Hope isn't well done from a technical standpoint. It just rubbed me a super duper wrong way.

But his text and his characters contradict each other. No matter how hard he tries, Harry does fall in love with a puppet. Gabrielle is literally physically unable to contradict him. He even makes a point of it hurting her earlier on, and him 'using the bond' to perk her up and what not.

It doesn't matter what mumbo jumbo you throw in about 'Well she has free will because he wants her to have free will' because that is not free will. It is merely the illusion of free will and an illusion that can be forcibly removed with nothing more than a stray thought from Harry. Oh and she'd even be happy about it!

I mean Christ, there's even a scene where she is physically assaulted by someone who she finds completely and utterly vile, it is explained that she can see his thoughts and feel what he wants to do. And then Harry cheers her up by thinking about her in a slutty outfit and implying he'll fuck her. Yep.

And the whole 'I'm Harry Potter and I won't fall in love with a doll' but he does. Because due to the nature of the 'bond' it's impossible for her to be anything other than that.

I feel like it would have been a much better tragedy than romance. Super Powered OP Harry can wave his hand and do anything with magic, but he can't wave his hand and make the veela problem okay and everyone happy as he does with every other thing in the story?

I could go on for a while, but it's mostly personal preference and nitpicky plot points. The whole student teacher thing that's brushed away with 'well you're not really a teacher' is also.....problematic at best.

****** It never felt like illusion to me. I suppose it's mostly personal preference as you said.

******* In case you didnt know, TE7 wrote Vitam Paramus. Its always fascinating to me to see authors that i like commenting on this sub.

I havent read either but have been meaning to get around to reading Vitam Paramus.

**** As true as that may be, in my mind it holds up well against other pairings as well, the writing is very good, and the story is original. Lots of emotional involvement, new scenery etc.

I don't remember much of the first one (Back to the World) but Playmate is one of the most realistic takes of the "Oh oops! I soul-bond/Veela bond to you without your consent" trope going on in fanfiction...
