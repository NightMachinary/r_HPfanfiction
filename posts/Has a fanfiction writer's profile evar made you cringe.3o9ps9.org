Sure has for me. Many times. I specifically remember one profile where someone trashed the canon pairings and said that they would never happen in the real world, then went on to defend Dramione to the hilt. When bringing up DracoXGinny, they said it was awful cos Ginny didn't deserve Draco. Oh Internet. It's even worse when people act like they're smart.


** I once saw a profile with over 15,000 words on it. This wasn't the odd part, however. What was strange was that it was pretty much all about killer whales....

** I can't say how many times I've seen the whole "98% of teenagers couldn't live without Abercrombie & Fitch (or something like that), copy and paste if you're one of 2% who wouldn't care" thing, it's so annoying. Or the one with the list of stereotypes, like "I'm a girl so I must like pink."

** When you pop up on a profile with all kinds of religious or political mumbojumbo. I go to a author's profile to find out more about their fics not their world view.

** Mine's pretty shit, as it mostly just lists a bunch of cliches that no one should ever use in their stories, and then I get people PMing me trying to justify why their own personal pet cliche is awesome.

** I hate the ones that have all the "Some made up percentage of people <x>! If you're one of the other percentage who <y> put this in your profile!"

Or "Add your name to this list and post it to your profile for <x>!"

I don't want to scroll through pages and pages of pithy quotes from other things because you feel like they "resonate with me, man"

I'm here to read your writing. If you want to wax on about plans for your writing, fine. Other crap, and I'm not at all interested.

*** I always assumed that was what the profiles were for. Of course, i used the kindle, where the profile was a seperate tab from the actual fanfic, so i never really had to pass through it, and it's a poor design that you have to read the profile to see their fanfic.

** One of my pet peeves is when writers have really, really, really, really, REALLY long profile descriptions that take a whole minute to scroll through. It gets especially annoying when you're trying to browse through the stories they have down below.

** Absolutely.

Ideal profile: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/717542/AngelaStarCat]]

Brief background information on the actual person and/or their current status. Background information on each WIP story.

WTF profile: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/267821/reptilia28]]

Over half the page is a mechanics guide for a single fic with 17k words. Nothing else.

** Back when I was in middle school it seemed like having the most of those copy-and-paste things on your profile was the coolest thing ever. I'd actually enjoy reading through those "copy and paste this on your profile if you are so RaNdom!!11!" things.

Anyways, times have changed, I'm happy to say.
