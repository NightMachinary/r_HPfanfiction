I posted something about magical artifacts recently, and that caused me to want to narrow down my search a bit more. So now I ask -- what cool items have you seen that are along the lines of the Marauder's Map, the Invisibility Cloak, etc? Things that could assist a certain someone as they wander around in the castle and create both mischief and excellent storytelling opportunities.


** In one story, the Slytherins have a piece of parchment that says how close Snape is (and possibly direction but it's been a while since I read it). They use it to not get caught by their head of house. The Marauders, of course, used it to track him down.
