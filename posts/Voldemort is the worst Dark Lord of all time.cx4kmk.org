Fics where Voldemort is actually shown to be the most terrifying and worst Dark Lord of all time.


** /"You are no doubt the worst dark lord I've ever heard of."/

/"But you have heard of me."/

I thought you meant, "He's bad at being evil." xD

** Blindness has a pretty... embarassed Voldemort. He keeps coming back in various horcruxes to the point where the public starts calling him Tom because of how lackluster he is now.

** The Downward Spiral series is super twisted. That is a Dark Lord worth fearing, but it is a very dark story. Many people have said they couldn't finish it because how how dark it is. It's a 6 book series and it is finished. I highly recommend it

**** No slash. There was some offscreen stuff with side characters, but Harry definitely has nothing to do with it. It's a pretty minor plot point and there was no descriptions of it.

** I remember seeing a fic with a bone chillingly terrifying voldemort.

In the fic, vividly described, was a dystopia in which Voldemort had taken over.

Harry had managed to destroy all of Voldemort's horcruxes, but he was killed at the end.

Voldemort could not create any more horcruxes because he had too little soul.

Because of this, he aged rapidly.

To prevent himself from dying, he took residence in the department of mysteries, endlessly studying the veil. He warped its ancient magic into something gruesome. he had ordered an line of people, muggle and muggleborn, to always be coming in endlessly so he could use them and sacrifice them for his rituals to stay alive. None of them would ever come out again. I could imagine the terrified faces of those people.

Voldemort was so weak and fragile, and was so desperately clinging onto life, it sent shivers down my spine. It was worse than voldemort at the end and Voldemort's baby like body in Goblet of Fire.

I fear no *human,* but that thing, it scares me.

Sadly I do not remember its name. I wish I did.

** The Lost Horcrux has a pretty terrifying Voldemort. Quite a few fics where Voldemort wins are pretty brutal, but this story has the worst of them all, by far.

  AU Canon Divergent. 5 yrs after Harry fakes his own death during the Battle of Hogwarts he returns to a dystopian nightmare world in the throes of Voldemort's dark grip, to rescue Hermione from her impending death and finally bring freedom and fulfill the Prophecy. Advisories: reference to spousal abuse, dark themes, The fucking Weasleys and other bad language. Usual Harmony bias.
