We were tasked with doing A level bio past papers all day in class, and instead of doing the work I made some a possible "past paper" for Magizoology/Care of Magical Creatures NEWTs. I based the look of the exam and the question style off of the A level bio past papers. As for the questions itself I was mainly inspired by stuff I found on the wiki. I thought this looked interesting, but I know not many people will care about the intricate details of magical theories and such. I really want to make a past paper for other subjects like potions, astronomy, and transfiguration but I'm looking for thoughts first on this one.


** If you're a fan of that... there used to be a website called hogwartsishere.com (seems like it's still around). It actually has Hogwarts classes and it had practical part for OWLs that involved some little flash games that would test your knowledge. You should check it out. Not my thing since I'm more here for the crackish stories but it might be something that appeals to some fans.

** Ah, A-Level Biology nostalgia.

The paper has been done nicely. I feel like a lot of the shorter questions are a bit on the easy side for something equivalent to A-Level - they're more like GCSE type questions - but some of the essay questions feel appropriate.

Essay questions 1, 2 and 6 in particular feel "right". They have that additional level of having scope for discussion that goes beyond mere statement of fact: evaluation, compare and contrast different opinions with justification, etc.

** Nice work. It must have cost some time. But are there solutions to compare as well?

** This was very interesting. I enjoyed how some of the answers to the questions could be found in the HP books. Additionally, it looked and felt like a real test.

** I never did A levels-- I'm from the states-- but I did do IB, which is pretty much the same format, so the formatting here rang a little close to home for me hahaha

** tbh, I'm not that interested into Magizoology but the paper looks amazing. I did take a few A lvl Bio practices.

All things aside, I think you did a great job! Definitely try n more

** AAH this almost gave me nightmares, questions like these are drowning my subconscious and these are similar enough for me to despise it on sight. Nothing against your work, it's wonderfully made and accurate if it can invoke the fight-or-flight feeling of a real board exam, great job.
