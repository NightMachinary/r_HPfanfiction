** I am not aware of any notable stories about the brothers.

The Peverell family and its unique magic are used as a plot point in Zenathea's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8082923/1/Give-It-Your-Best-Shot][Give It Your Best Shot]], though this is really just a bunch of wanton speculation on the author's part.

As for topical suggestions that might be worked into a story, I think Antioch's wand is the most curious. JKR claims on her website that thestral hair, which forms the core of the wand, was "a tricky substance that only wizards that have mastered death can control." She also writes in /The Three Brothers/

#+begin_quote
  "So the oldest brother, who was a combative man, asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence: a wand that must always win duels for its owner, a wand worthy of a wizard who had conquered Death!"
#+end_quote

So how exactly did Antioch manage to lose? What loophole terminated the "must always win duels for its owner" and set the wand upon a bloody path through the hands of the likes of Egbert the Egregious and Grindelwald? This seems a notable inconsistency in canon between the legend of the wand and the events surrounding it as we know them. What could have caused this?

Another curiosity concerning the Hallows: the two families, the Potters and the Gaunts, that retained ownership of their artifacts throughout the years were sundered almost completely. In the book, Ron repeats the line, "Wand of Elder, never prosper," suggesting a ill end to those associated with the third Hallow. Is this a possible side effect of mortals' close association with Death? Did the brothers truly master Death, or is it the other way around?

** I'm also interested in stories like these. Looks like it's not a popular fic.
