Ok, so hear me out before you hit the downvote button. I agree that having him be Lord Harry James Potter-Black-(insert family names of all four founders of Hogwarts, Merlin, Morgana, and Arthur Pendragon. In fact, to spice things up, Harry is also Lord Vaseline) makes absolutely no sense. Before I continue. can I just mention how annoying it is that no one understands that Merlin is his /first/ name. You can't be Lord Merlin. You /can/ be Lord Ambrosius/Emrys.

But anyway, I digress. It actually kind of makes sense for him to not only /be/ part of the Wizengamot but also have many seats. Not those of famous figures, but of other pureblood families. All purebloods are related and the Potters are purebloods too. Which means that if a family dies out, the Potters are in line to inherit their seat. So even if the Potters didn't have a seat of their own, they must have inherited at least one.

Of course, this only makes sense if Wizengamot seats are hereditary.


** I might be mistaken but are there any actual signs in the books that the Wizengamot seats are hereditary? I mean we know that they're mostly being sat in by crotchety old purebloods, but that's not terribly indicative of anything, as it's noticeable in our own muggle politics that the people who win votes are mostly the rich upper class. That doesn't mean there aren't exceptions of course, but assuming that the Wizengamot being incompetent purebloods is because the seats are hereditary is a bit of a leap, I think. It could just be because the wizarding public who elects them is full of idiots (want proof? see : reactions to the Prophet's articles xD)

But do tell if there's any proof to the contrary in the books, I'd be interested to know !

*** We see no mention of the seats being hereditary, not being gained any other way, so people just figure that with the wizarding world being a bit old fashioned and having split off so long ago it might be similar to the old House of Lords.

For all we know the seats could be for sale, 20 galleons each, no more than one per syllable of your last name, a 3% discount to anyone born in a year ending with 7.

*** I always took the Wizengamot to be more akin to the House of Lords in British parliament. I could be wrong but I believe the position in the House of Lorda is hereditary as it is based on titles and position in the peerage and those titles are definitely hereditary.

**** Lords isn't hereditary anymore, it's appointed for life mostly (a certain number, 92, of existing hereditary Lords can sit in it, but their children cannot inherit those seats).

This change was introduced in 1999, so when HP was first written, it would have been mostly hereditary though

It is Fanon that the Wizengamot is hereditary, there is no mention of elections to it in Canon.

***** Ahh, see that is where I was working off assumption it was still hereditary.

Well, then I always just pictured it like the Lords used to be then. :)

I am curious if there is a canon answer/explanation for how it works that Rowling will give.

**** The assumption you are making however, is that all pureblood families are noble families if it is a hereditary system, for example the Weasleys never have a seat in the Wizengamot in any fanfic, despite being purebloods.

In my opinion it makes sense for the Black family to have a seat if it is hereditary because they are on the same level as the Malfoys etc, but the whole 'Lord Potter' thing is total fanon, the Potters lived in Godrics Hollow, on that basis they are far closer to the Weasleys than the Malfoys or Blacks.

***** I, in no way, implied all Pureblood families were members of the Wizengamot, nor do I assume that. I am saying that if you are a member of the Wizengamot, it would be hereditary. In fact, I never made reference to blood status at all.

My point about British Parliament was merely saying that it was more akin to the House of Lords (which is based on "nobility" i.e. it is hereditary), rather than the House of Commons, which i believe is an elected position.

Also, in point of fact, in "Lady Black, Lord Potter", a large plot point that greatly effects the Weasleys revolves around them holding a Wizengamot seat. So it does exist as a point in some fanfics.

*** There's no indication of anything. They could be hereditary, or elected for life, or appointed by the existing members, or drawn by lot, or selected by a magical cheeseboard. We don't even really get much indication of who sits in them, except that they're ineffectual and easily swayed (which seems to apply to most of Wizarding Britain anyway, so you could say they are representative).

** While Wizengamot is a cross between a court and a parliament, we know nothing how its members are appointed. However it would seem mighty unfair to larger population if it was a purely hereditary system owned only by old families.

After all larger part of the population does not appear to be of pure blood nor hold to their fanatical views. This is a fringe ideology that flourished only due to Voldemort's power.

My personal belief is that it is an elected body with each member being equivalent to an MP in the House of Commons (UK) and each member representing their own constituency.

Also Potters were considered a minor pure blood line with no great significance. They are not counted among the sacred twenty eight. So it would be unlikely they would hold many seats (if any at all).

*** The Sacred Twenty-Eight has no actual significance. It's just some anonymous person deciding which families had the purest of blood. The only reason the Potter's didn't get in is that it's a common Muggle name. I agree that it likely isn't hereditary, at least, not anymore. It's possible that before the war, they /were/ hereditary.

I wrote this mostly because I realised that, in many fics where Wizengamot seats /are/ hereditary, they give horrible justifications (like, "that's just the way it is" being the most we got out of a fic that I feel is pretty famous, but I can't remember the name of). This makes sense to me if seats are hereditary.
