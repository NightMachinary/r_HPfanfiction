This is a question I've been wondering about for my fic, which is a response to this prompt:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/99s775/discussion_lavender_brown_vs_the_goblet_of_fire/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share]]

Harry is helping Lavender to prepare for the TWT, so I'm in need for a list of spells which would just be practice since they'd know them already and spells which they'd learn from scratch.

Also, not sure about the flair, hope it's okay. Thanks in advance!

Edit: anyone else who can't scroll down on mobile when typing? ü§î


** I think [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com]] has with many spells a year they are taught.

*** I think that's the site that basically accepts everything as canon? Not exactly sure how reliable it is tbh.

**** Yes, their canon is very wide, but it is probably the biggest collection of people studying all those issues.

** I think apart from the Patronus they didn't learn many spells that wouldn't be taught normally, but they did a lot of training to learn to cast spells reliably. Learning the incantation and wand movement of a spell and casting it in a classroom is one thing, casting it while running through a dark hallway and actually hitting the death eater who's following you while dodging incoming curses is another. Most probably already knew expelliarmus in theory, but wouldn't have been able to cast it in a stressful situation without DA training.

** IIRC, Harry teaches them the expelliarmus, impedimenta, reducto, stupefy, and protego, which I think they all would know, or at least those in Harry's year or above would know. I think the patronus charm was the only one none of the members were familiar with.

*** Okay and which of those would Harry know during fourth year? Because my fic starts in fourth year and I'd like to keep that close to canon. Did they learn stupefy and protego in fourth year? Were those taught by Barty?

**** Expelliarmus and protego he already learned in the second year, while impedimenta, reducto, and stupefy he learned during fourth year.

***** Sweet, thank you very much! This gives me something to work with. It's admittedly a bit confusing to figure out which spells were learned when. üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

***** Note that Expelliarmus was not part of the curriculum that year, it was Lockhart's Dueling Club that taught it. Most of Harry's useful spells were learned outside of class (except Summoning Charms).

** It's actually very tough to determine when canonically spells are taught - especially with the training montage leading up to the third task muddying the waters. Expelliarmus and protego are both implied to be second year spells, and there's a ton of unnamed jinxes shown in books one to four. I don't have my books on hand to comb through though.
