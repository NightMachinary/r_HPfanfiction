It was a specific fanfiction awhile ago and I can't seem to find it. Where Narsissa has an obsession with James Potter. Or more importantly sex with James Potter. In fact, there's quite a club dedicated to sleeping with him. Then he falls in love and goes monogamous with Lily and the first few books happen etc.

The club latches onto Harry when he gets older and he's able to use their help to beat the war. I also remember giggling madly while reading it, and would really like to again.

Anyone know what fic this is???

Thanks!


** I'm almost positive It has been removed. I know exactly the story you're trying to find, and I had it followed because I needed the outrageousness of it at the time. But it's off both of my follow/favorite lists on my accounts.

*** Holy shit, yeah this is the story the OP was looking for.

I know I followed this, I wonder why it wasn't there when I looked last night. Maybe I just looked right by it. Doesn't help that Narcissa is a rather prominent figure in the story, yet she's not listed, I guess.

EDIT: Why was this downvoted..? I was rather happy it popped back up. God forbid.

**** This is the non-smut one if I remember correctly. Gotta Google for the erotic one, the good version got nuked from FFN in like five seconds.

***** So the erotic version wasn't authored by the original author, someone called kallissi authored the erotic parts and published the full thing without any permission. They've done this several times now to different stories. Regardless the original author took offense to what is the textbook definition of plagiarism and has nuked it off of every site they could do so, FFN, fictionhunt, hpfanfictionarchive, etc...

Currently it only seems to exist on a particular WordPress that got it off of fictionhunt. Unfortunately WordPress is terrible for archival compared to fictionhunt. Anyone got a link to an epub?

***** Maybe that's why then. I definitely remember a bit more smut than this one had.

Thanks!
