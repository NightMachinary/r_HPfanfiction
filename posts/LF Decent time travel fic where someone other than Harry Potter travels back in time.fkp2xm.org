I really like time travel genre, but too many are just "Harry (with or without his friends) travel back in time from a desolate future with either OP power, OP knowledge or trains super hard and kills Voldemort" with a little variation here or there.

So I'd like to read something different, where someone other than Harry Potter travels back in time. And also not Cursed Child plot. Preferably long with 100k+ words.

The only ones I've read and liked are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10991501][Hermione Granger and the Serpent's Renaissance]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10972919][The Evil Overlord List]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005][Oh God not again?]]. (and maybe [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13170637][Fate]] is also a time-travel fic)


** This one's unique, as far as I know:

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19949440/chapters/47238583]])

And if you don't mind a self-recommendation, I'm working on this:

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15430560/chapters/35816418]])

Although to be honest I'm kind of frozen on updating it, since I'm looking at my outline, and looking at the news, and thinking “too soon” even though I plotted this out in 2018.

  Lavender takes one step forward and -- just like the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the drop of a pebble -- Hogwarts is left behind. There's no jump, no flashes of light, no whirlwinds of disconnected images. Just one little step; behind stood her war and in front stands 1947. "Huh," she says to herself, "didn't see this in the tea leaves."

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?
