-Description of /Nobody Told Me The Rules/

A fanfic where Harry is not the main character but a OC is. Has metamorphagus and abuses it non-existing limits. Literally creates clothing from his hair. Mad-Scientist sort of feel.

Thanks redditors for any ideas

** A random question, is the story actually any good?

*** First two chapters are okay. No greatness yet, but more readable than most. I will report back again in 30 minutes.

The writing could be improved, but the story seems okay. The OC has read HP (from the looks of it) and is a bit mary-sue-y, so you need to be in the mood for that.

Edit: The story would be loads better if beta'd better (or at all?). Plenty of sentences that should be reworded to be easier to read, sometimes the author forgets punctuation.

Edit 2: The main character is definitely Mary-Sue-y.

Edit 3: The OC just read a book written by Grindelwald (with notes of Dumbledore), and wants to give it to Dumbledore as christmas present. Talk about opening old wounds, brutal.

Edit 4: It has the "No one was alive in Godrics Hollow so the books must all lie"-excuse. You know, Dumbledore literally says that magic leaves traces, and there is even the poosibility that you might be able to legilimize a baby. But no one asked Harry, so all lies. Gah!

Edit 5: Did the girls at the ravenclaw-table just look "hungrily" at an 11-year-old?\\
Please, no sex before you are at least like 14, else the story is illegal for me to read, Mr. OC. Thanks.

**** Ouch, then; lack of punctuation is a terrible thing. But thanks for sacrificing yourself to answer the question.

***** Don't get me wrong, there is more worse than better stuff out there - it's certainly above average imo, but also quite a bit below "great".

The lack is mostly periods at the end of paragraphs. You notice it, but it's still okay to read. Any good beta should catch it though.
