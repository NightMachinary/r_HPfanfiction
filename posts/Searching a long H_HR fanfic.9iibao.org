I'm trying to get into reading H/HR fanfics again.

I'm searching for a longer fanfiction with the H/HR pairing. I dislike stories AFTER the last book where Ron and Hermione are already together, so the story should ideally take place before that. I want the characters to just act realistically though, like in a lot of fanfiction the actions of Harry or Hermione just seem very out of character like Harry or Hermione suddenly getting overly romantic and stuff, it just seems weird... things should take a natural pace.

​

I really just want the writting to be realistic and professional (reading stories with typos in every sentence is a bit annoying).

​

Could you please recommend me anything like that?

Optional: I also like if Ron is just Ron, funny and a good friend, I don't like it if the story bashes him or whatever.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12592097/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lady-Thief][Harry Potter and the Lady Thief]], linkffn(12592097), seems to fit your request very well:

- Long, 570k words and may have 100k more
- Ron and Hermione never got together
- Very slow burn, and really tests the patience of H/Hr enthusiasts, but when they got finally together, it's very satisfying
- Ron remained Harry's best friend and his Auror partner
- Excellent grammar and spelling

Finally, I'd like to point that the plot is interesting, and especially so after Voldemort was defeated.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

*** That sounds great! One last question, is it written from Harry's perspective? (I would love that) like... Harry is the MC of Harry Potterand imo FF's should be written from the MC's perspective and not a sidecharacters if that makes any sense haha.

**** That's the point of this story. Its author generally writes Hermione as a revolutionary or warrior who compiles huge body count of her enemies. This fic is supposed to depict a less violent version of her.

Furthermore, thieves as main characters are rare among HP fanfics. “A Black Comedy” and “Lechery, Larceny, and Luna Lovegood” are the very few completed ones.

****** She's no warrior or revolutionary in this story and she has no body count. She merely wants revenge on those who framed her and ruined her family, and for that, she needs to be able to rob them blind - or so she thinks.

(Dumbledore thought that her becoming a thief would be better than her pursuing more violent forms of revenge, so he arranged that.)

** It's often recommended, and for good reason. The Augurey has Harry, Hermione and Ron be in-character. Yes, there's a bit where Ron blows his top but the reason why makes total sense with his character. However, he gets over HHr happening and he goes back to being their friend. It's pretty long so far, and updates fairly regularly (every month or two, I think?), and the writing and grammar are good.

** It's not long, but if you want a fic where Harry and Hermione are together without acting overly romantic, you have Definition of Romance linkffn(2302425).

You also have Don't you Worry linkffn(12192798). It's post-Hogwart, but AU enough not to have Ron/Hermione together... And I did find the way the relationship is described to be quite original.

But, yeah, if you find a great long H/Hr, without them being too OOC, I'm interested too, to be honest...
