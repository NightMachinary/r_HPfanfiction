I've been looking for decent crossovers where Harry is a timelord. Something similar to "two hearts are better than one" i don't mind how it's happened or even if it's a rebirth/reincarnation kinda deal. I'm open to suggestions lol. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12894968/2/]]


** Considering that i havent yet finished the fanfic i cant tell you whether or not harry does become a timelord but a really good HP/Doctor Who Crossover is:

This one was good.

Harry sees weeping angels as a kid, and they become his greatest fear. When the DADA class covers boggarts, Harry's greatest fear manifests itself as a weird statue of a weeping angel.

Apparently, the fic has a sequel, but I don't remember reading it.

  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.
