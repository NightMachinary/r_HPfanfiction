As the title suggests. Just curious for him having a wolf familiar versus the pretty common wolf animagus/patronus.

  Harry didn't appear at Hogwarts causing concern. Albus immediately head's out to Privet Drive to find out what was going on, along with Minerva and a reluctant Severus Snape. What they find out changes everything for everyone in the wizarding world. Is there a chance for anyone to go back and fix past mistakes? is there any hope at all for the magical world? COMPLETE

*** Would you rather have people have un familiars, plant pets, instead of animals. I guess it came from the old witch trials where they would call the cats owned by the "Witches" were called familiars. So in fanon, most pets are just called familiars.
