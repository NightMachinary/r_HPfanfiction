** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1712085/1/Exitus-Acta-Probat][Exitus Acta Probat]] -this is a tomione fic that has angst, drama, and also some comedy. I love this story so much, it's so underrated

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13250357/1/Sirius-Black-and-the-Girl-With-the-Terrible-Hair][Sirius Black and the Girl With the Terrible Hair]] -this is by the same author as exitus acta probat and it's equally as good. it's a sirius/hermione pairing

** Hey! Take a look at the subreddit before asking us to be your personal buttlers. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/npf420/classics/]] is eight hours old, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/npl4xp/personal_favorites_that_avoid_canon_rehash/]] is two hours. It is getting really boring.
