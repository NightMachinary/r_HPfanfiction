As the title says. I read this fanfiction a while ago, and want to go back to it, but I don't remember what it is. For details: it has slytherin harry, he has a bunch of friends like blaise, draco, theo, and more. They have a boggart lesson where harry dying is all their boggarts, and real harry comforts them.
