If one makes a thread asking a generic [[/r/AskReddit]] style question, the response to that question should be added as a comment and not in the thread body. This is rule #1 on AskReddit for the following reason:

#+begin_quote
  This is to allow for users to distinguish between the question being asked, and its answers, when voting.
#+end_quote

Additionally, it's generally considered poor taste to make a discussion thread that is nothing more than a thinly veiled platform for one to rant about something without the intention of participating in the ensuing discussion.

A better approach to ranting on [[/r/HPfanfiction]] is to make a thread saying something to the effect of "X in a fic really bothers me" with the thread body discussing why its annoying, how one might improve upon it, and asking for thoughts and feedback.

Taking this into consideration will lead to more engaging, higher quality discussion threads that get many thoughtful responses.


** One has to be careful with these things. In general, regulating discussion tends to kill off discussion. Making people jump through even very small hoops often has a significant impact on whether people can be bothered to post or not.

AskReddit is a huge sub with massive momentum behind it. Even a, say, 20% reduction in discussion there would still result in a lively forum.

This sub is considerably smaller, especially when you limit your focus to threads in which discussion is permitted (i.e. discounting Looking For threads). I think adding too many rules and procedures would have a real risk of reducing the ease and quantity of interesting discussion.

For the same reason I opposed the new rule banning discussion in Looking For threads. I think that rule has resulted in a significant reduction in the amount of interesting discussions happening (and if you look at the survey results, lacks popular support, with only 15.8% actively supporting a ban on civil discussion in request threads). And further I think that the same objective - avoiding bullying over preferences - could have been achieved simply by enforcing civility rules more actively.

I just don't think the sub is big enough to justify increased formality when it comes to discussion. Just let the people talk.

**** Look at the side-bar, rule 7:

#+begin_quote
  Request threads are for recommendations. Make a discussion thread if you want to express your opinions about the thing being requested.
#+end_quote

There was a big debate about it a while back. Thread here:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5v5f2v/new_rule_proposals/]]

Somehow the proposal evolved from enforcing "constructive discussion" only (i.e. enforcing basic civility and getting rid of vacuous insult posts) to banning all critical discussion of the request, no matter how politely it is put or reasonably argued.

***** Yeah, I can see that if someone asks for Snape/Malfoy MPreg or something we don't want them to get a load of abuse just because other people don't want that too but I think a bit of discussion like "I've never read anything like that, what's the appeal to you?" should clearly be allowed.

Oh well, as [[/u/AnIndividualist]] said, we don't have to follow it.

It's a rule I'll be happy not to comply with if it's all the same.

I'm perfectly content if people to disregard my comments or outright insult my intelligence and self worth.

*** Rule #7 isn't enforced. I've made a mockery of it on multiple occasions with no repercussions. Rule #7 didn't cow us from discussing requests in a request thread. I just can't see [[/u/denarii]] and the other three mods actually enforcing the rule without major backlash from the community.

It's a failed rule from an even bigger failure of a proposal.

** Regulating discussion kills discussion. In addition, why are you trying to mold this community into your "ideal community"?

Not how things work here, OP. [[/r/HPfanfiction]] is fairly laid back in its culture and attitude. This sub isn't big enough to support greater formality or more stringent rules. This will not lead to more engaging, higher quality discussion threads that get many thoughtful responses. Instead, it will lead to further stagnation - a problem this sub has experienced.

Different subs have different attitudes and cultures. [[/r/HPfanfiction]]'s culture is different than that of [[/r/AskReddit]]'s. One must take that into account when posting as well.

*** Once again, I'm not trying to regulate anything. People are free to post however they want. I know that with the new rule banning people from posting in LF threads, everyone is wary of new rules and restrictions. Perhaps this wasn't the right time or way to propose this.

I am trying to encourage people to post in a way that I think will encourage better discussion. You may disagree, that's fine.

Nobody cares about the rule, and from my experience from seeing discussions in LF threads, and inciting discussions myself, it isn't enforced. I'm not going to be wary of a rule that won't be enforced.
