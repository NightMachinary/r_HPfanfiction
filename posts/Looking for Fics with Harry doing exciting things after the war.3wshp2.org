Harry wins the war and gets bored. He's used to having an adventure filled life so he turns to more exciting endeavours, no holds barred duelling, being a hitman and hunting down dark lords, exploring the world ect.

Anyone got anything like this?


** sure, linkffn(3918135) it has a sequel as well

  After the fall of Voldemort, Harry makes a dumb career choice and Ron tags along. Hermione, sensibly, doesn't. Seven years later, a very different trio are drawn into an international web of intrigue by a little girl and an old relic. Lesson to be learned: stay in school, kids. Post-DH; Slightly AU. Rated M for language and violence. Not slash.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

** *Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution*, linkffn(10595005): the real war begins after Voldemort's fall.

*Homecoming*, linkffn(11054843): Harry never went to Hogwarts, and 4 years later, someone was stirring trouble again. Unexpected villain and ending.

*Failsafe*, linkffn(11281891): few months after the war, Harry and Ginny got thrown into the Lord of Rings dimension.

**** None of the above is really a romance fic.

The marriage law revolution fic is very suitable for bloodthirsty readers.

***** I tried to read it, I gave it five chapters or so but I found it to be completely terrible. Are we meant to support Hermione and Harry? They're 100% unlikable in it. They are terrible racists that kill people who disagree with them and feel justified in it. Christ, I usually dislike Hermione but this is something else.

****** Harry and Hermione in that story are what happens when you take kids and turn them into soldiers, and have them fight a guerilla war for years against wizard nazis bent on genocide. Their first thought when faced with a problem is "who do we kill to solve it?" They're messed up, they never really got "out of the war" and have kept thinking like child soldiers, and they'll take a long time to get better (which they eventually do).

Though for all their PTSD and bloodthirstyness, they don't kill people who disagree with them (apart from "collateral damage" in war or coup d'etat) - they kill people who actively support mass-murder and mass-rape. They're not going to kill Augusta Longbottom for thinking or saying that wizard culture is superiour to muggle culture.

And they are faced with a Wizarding Europe who didn't exactly follow all that "muggle nonsense" about human rights, democracy, equality before the law and other weird stuff. A wizarding Europe ruled by pureblood aristocrats who didn't take well to seeing "uppity mudbloods" topple purebloods in Britain - it could give their own muggleborns ideas.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.
