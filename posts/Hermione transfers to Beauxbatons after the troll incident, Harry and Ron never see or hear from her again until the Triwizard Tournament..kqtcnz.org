I'm looking for stories where Hermione is transfered to Beauxbatons after months of being friendless and constantly verbally bullied by Ron with the troll incident being the last straw. Harry and Ron tried to find her but were unable to. Hermione managed to dash out of the bathroom with minor injuries and left Hogwarts soon after. Both Harry and Ron felt guilty, Ron for constantly making fun of her and Harry for not standing up for her.

Years later during the Triwizard Tournament, Hermione returns to Hogwarts to participate. (Either allow 4th years to participate or the tournament is held later in year 5/6) She had changed a lot both physically and in terms of personality (still the miss-know-it-all but less bossy). Let your creativity take over from here.

As for pairing, I wish it to not be the main focus and I would prefer to only be either Ron/Hermione or Harry/Hermione. Others just seems weird to me.


** Sounds interesting. The only fic I can think of that involves Hermione going to Beauxbatons and coming to Hogwarts for TWT is linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27111157/chapters/66202159]]) --- but it's a heavy AU, and she never attends Hogwarts in the first place.

As a bit of an aside, no matter how much bashfic authors wish it were so, Ron was not bullying Hermione. Read the first few chapters of PS: Ron would have loved nothing better to be left alone by Hermione and was open and direct about it. All their negative interactions were initiated by Hermione, because hectoring and unsolicited advice was how early-canon Hermione expressed friendship. So can we please bury this fanon already? Please?

** If you're only looking for stories, you should change the flair to request if you can because a prompt invites discussion and I don't think you want that.
