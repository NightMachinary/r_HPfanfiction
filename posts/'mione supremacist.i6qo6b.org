what im imagining is a fic where 'mione is a muggle and muggleborn supremacist where she claims everything muggle related is so much more advance and civilised than the wizarding world where she claims that things are barbaric 'barbaric' in how it runs things, is in general, wizarding traditions and customs, etc etc... pissing of everyone all the more, effectively shitting on purebloods, a large majority of half bloods and what i would even bet as quite a few muggleborns.

for an example when it come house elves she understands that they live of the work the serve others but sees that as barbaric slavery and even though she understands that they quite literally want to kill themselves or do die if they are not bound and working she wants them free because slavery is bad and it would never happen in the muggle world - they would be so much more happier if their not enslaved they've just been brainwashed into believing that they have to.

that is just an example of what could be something that would happen. bonus point if the harry of the story is more.... how to say..... pureblooded in his attitude i guess - like he follows through in wizarding traditions and things like holiday rituals, actually has a charming personality, makes alliances more or less where ever he can instead of just telling people to fuck of like in cannon, makes smart decisions that will impact his life and his future families lives (again can tie into the alliances part) instead of blindly following others and blindly running into events, friendships and decisions, etc etc... i think you get the gist.


** I'd say almost every story that contains Hermione bashing would do

Watch as Harry figures out his destiny as a large threat looms over the horizon, unknown to the unsuspecting magical population. Would Harry Potter be willing to take on his role as the Saviour of Magic or would the world burn in his absence? Harry/Daphne. COMPLETE!

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.
