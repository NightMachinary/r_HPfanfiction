Looking for fics where the death eaters are revolutionaries more then terrorists. This will likely involve a saner Voldemort, though he could have been driven insane by dark magic and let his original goal be changed. Pretty much any fic where harry decides to side with Voldemort, or even just his followers if Voldemort is dead or too insane to be saved.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

** Well, there's linkffn(Twins: A Different Life by Jessiikaa15) It seems abandoned but worth a read if you like the WGWL trope.

Then there was one where Snape was talking to Harry and Hermione in St. Mungo's when Ron found them. Later, it was revealed that Draco, Harry and Hermione were cousins and Hermione was Bellatrix's daughter. I forget. I'll try to search for it and then edit it in later if I find it.

  When Voldemort attacked he didn't kill Lily and James. When he met his downfall they mistook Harry's twin as the GWL, they send their son away to the Dursleys but he doesn't quite make it in to the Dursley's loving care. Harry will take Hogwarts and his 'family' by storm and by the time the 'light' realize their mistake it will be too late for them to fix. OOC!Dark!Powerful!Harry.

** linkffn(Realignment by PuzzleSB)

Harry timetravels to the 1940s to kill young Tom Riddle and the roles are reversed: Tom is the young hero, apprentice of Dumbledore, and Harry is the Dark Lord hunting him. Oh, and there's also Grindelwald waging war across Europe.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.
