Hello everyone I've just read a story that was a Harry Potter/ avengers crossover it was the lokijarson series And now I'm loving the pairing of loki and Tony stark with Harry Potter as their son But can't really find any stories on them.... I'd even be happy with Harry just being lokis son I've read one where loki slept with lily while her and James where on a break it goes through his years at hogwarts and beyond with Harry rescuing all his siblings (norse mythology) I've just found these pairing/family dynamics really interesting and would love it if anyone has any story recommendations either on fanfic or ao3 would be preferable but if there's a good one on wattpad I'm okay with that too I just prefer the former sites Thank you in advance ü§ó


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17926664/chapters/42330374][On Punching Gods and Absentee Dads]]. I read it on ao3. It might be the fact that I read it all in one night and at 3:20 you start to get emotional at every turn, but it's also fantastic world building by the author and maybe a little cheesy at the very end tbh

Every painful thing he's ever gone through can be traced back to one man. Now Harry's got super strength he can't control and an almost unnecessary amount of magical power.

  Harry finally defeats Voldemort, but only after the world has been destroyed. Harry has his vengeance, but gets pulled into Voldemort's ritual and is dragged with his body to an alternate universe. First Chapter sets up the first scene. You can skip it reasonably safely. - Complete - Now up on webnovel under my original author name, burnable.
