(Not sure if I managed to flair this right, since there doesn't seem to be a flair button. Also, I'm new here. Hello.)

(Edit: Whoops, guess it's stuck in the title now?)

I vaguely remembered some scenes earlier but for the life of me, I cannot remember what plot they were attached to. Any assistance would be appreciated. It's nagging me.

One thing these fics had in common, unless I'm remembering wrong, was that the pranks were performed by adult witches and/or wizards to get back at the Dursleys for their treatment of Harry.

*Fic 1:* Probably takes place over the winter holidays, and Dudley was very much present. There was a psycho Santa roaming the Dursleys' house. One of the Dursleys had to hide in the cupboard under the kitchen sink, while another hid in Harry's old cupboard (god knows where the other one went). I think Santa might have had a chainsaw? At some point the three get turned into animals and sent off to a zoo. I think Vernon was a walrus and Petunia a giraffe. Oh, and they went Christmas shopping at some point only for Vernon and Dudley to become the victims of some weird musical performance in public (I believe Petunia looked on in horror). Whatever the case, I'm pretty sure that Harry was given memories of all this as a Christmas present. I think the Flamels may have been involved.

*Fic 2:* I feel like I've read this one very recently, but I'm hitting a brick wall. Vernon and Petunia are just leaving the house when Petunia mentions needing to cross the moat. Vernon says, "Since when have we had a moat?!"

*Fic 3:* Wherever Vernon goes into the garden, a rake mysteriously appears in front of him and smacks him in the face. I'm pretty sure house elves were involved in this one. I'm also pretty sure that this escalated at some point, but I can't remember how.

Thanks for any clues.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?
