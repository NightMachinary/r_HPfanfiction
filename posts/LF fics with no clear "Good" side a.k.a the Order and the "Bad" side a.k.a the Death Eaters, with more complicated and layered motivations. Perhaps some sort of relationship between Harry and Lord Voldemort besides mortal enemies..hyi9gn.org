#+TITLE: LF fics with no clear "Good" side a.k.a the Order and the "Bad" side a.k.a the Death Eaters, with more complicated and layered motivations. Perhaps some sort of relationship between Harry and Lord Voldemort besides mortal enemies. Fem!Voldemort would be good too.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

  AU, where nothing as simple as good vs. evil. A summer spent trapped in Number 4 and barred from contact with his friends leads to Harry accepting an offer to correspond with a Death Eater. The consequences of thinking for oneself are far reaching.
