Are there any fics where Harry isn't human, I don't care what he is, but I'd prefer no romance, if there is I don't want slash fics


** Harry is a Dragon, and that's okay.

No idea if there's romance, I'm not even halfway through it.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** In both of these fics, Harry is a Time Lord and the consequences of that change in biology are felt deeply by one Dark Lord. One of them is more cracky than the other but I'll include it anyway. Harry is more cold-blooded than most humans and Vernon always wanted a reptile, so he gets treated considerably better than in canon. linkffn(Exotic Pet by Lucillia) linkffn(Human Plus by Lady Salazar)

#+begin_quote
  A Harry Potter who's a full-blooded member of a certain two-hearted, cold-blooded species of Crocodillian descent from a certain planet whose name starts with a G and rhymes with Mallifrey ends up on the Dursley's doorstep. He ends up having a much happier life there than he normally would've due to the fact that he "Isn't people".

  Melody Pond wasn't the first baby conceived on the TARDIS. Once upon a time, Lily and James Potter adventured the universe, too, before fate forced them back to fixed points and prophecies. HP/DW crossover, extremely short oneshot AU.
