So I finished reading Becoming by SensiblyTainted. (It wasn't finished though,Shame because it was really good). I really loved the way that everyone was characterized. From Snape, to Ron, to Hermione, to Lucius, to Narcissa, and how Harry and Voldemort was done, that was interesting. (Won't spoil for those who haven't read it).

But, if anyone knows any stories with characterizations like these, who has read Becoming and know what I'm talking about; I'd love it. Doesn't have to be slash, can be het. Just have the characters like in Becoming by SensiblyTainted.

Although I'd be happy with slash (love slash fics).

Would rather the story be completed, like I said shame it wasn't completed. (Hopefully the writer can complete it).
