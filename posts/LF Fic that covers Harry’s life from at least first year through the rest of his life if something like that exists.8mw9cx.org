The fic should start from at least first year, and ideally at the very least, go throughHarry's adult life (marriage, career etc..) if it goes until his death, that is an added bonus


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4133028/1/The-Birth-of-Evil][Birth of Evil]], linkffn(4133028) -- Covers his whole life but after Hogwarts is mostly just summarized. Ruthless Harry.

  Tom Riddle was able to use magic long before he received a wand. In this AU, Harry has the same grasp on his magic...and a hatred for Muggles... Watch the birth of evil. Smart!Dark!Evil!Harry, All 7 Years

** I know a fic that covers Harry's time after Hogwarts and his adulthood to when he became a grandfather than his death. Everything before that was cannon from the books.
