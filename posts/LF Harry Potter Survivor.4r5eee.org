** Harry portrays with Cedric's body to Isla Sorna in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9727741/1/The-Point-of-No-Return][The Point of No Return]] and ends up being a BAMF by the time the events of the third movie start to happen. Similar to TPoNR, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8390513/1/Found][Found]] and it's rewrite [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11095401/1/Stranded][Stranded]] have Harry being abandoned on Isla Sorna by the Dursley's.

Harry is exiled in [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2849954][Undone Wars]] to pegasus galaxy where he lives in a cave and also a awesome survivor, even more so after meeting up with Ronon Dex.

In Esama's Tumbling HP Crossovers [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1647644/chapters/3492878][Chapter 2: Because Why Not]] Harry ends up on a astroid and has to terraform it. Likewise, in [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1647644/chapters/3493007][Chapter 5: Forest Spirit]] Harry ends up with a seemingly sentient forest. In [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2849816][Space Haven]], the residents of an besieged Hogwarts travel via hidden gate to Atlantis and must get everything working again. In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2320601/1/Under-Siege][Under Siege]] Hogwarts is locked down, but again, they have everything they need and it's more about building a community.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5273991/1/An-Accidental-Affair][An Accidental Affair]] Harry ends up on Hades (from Pitch Black), but it gets a little silly, as he has all this stuff on him in a bottomless bag, and in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6285973/1/Animalis][Animalis]] Harry (and Remus and Sirius) end up on Hades but the focus is more on the slash then the plot. I want stories where the character has to /struggle/ to survive.

A group of students uses a defective portray in both [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/205025][Island of Fire series]] and [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4014733][The ever-changing tide]] Temeraire and Naruto crossovers respectively, and both in line with what I'm looking for. In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7398966/1/The-Ark-and-the-Desert][The Ark and the Desert]] most of Hogwarts ends ups on a distant world and has to terraform it to survive, but gets a bit bogged down in strange science.

  7th year fic. Hogwarts is the safest place in the Wizarding World. What happens when its teachers are struck down and it's separated from the rest of the world, leaving the students to fend for themselves? No slash, pairings undecided. No HBP or DH.

  (Adopted from Monsters-Need-Love-Too) A faulty Portkey, a mangled leg, a dead classmate, a pair of wands, and a one way ticket to Isla Sorna. Today just isn't Harry Potter's day. Neither is tomorrow. Next week isn't looking too good either. Next month? How about next year? No? DAMN! (BAMF!Survivor!Harry, Slash, Timeline compliant.)

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.
