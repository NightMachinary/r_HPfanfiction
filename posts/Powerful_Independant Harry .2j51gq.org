looking for some super!harry fics , i'd prefer the pairing to be Harry/Hermione but i can read others if they're good enough . I'm coming back to fanfiction reading after a long hiatus (i stopped reading at like 2009) so i don't remember many older fics which are classics of the genre and havn't read many newer fics.So reminding of some older fics would be very appreciated as well.


** This one is Harry/Tonks but I really enjoyed it. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2567419/1/Harry-Potter-And-The-Summer-Of-Change]]

*** I've seen this recommended a few times. In my experience, most fics of this sort basically reduce Hermione to little more than a love interest and a serial damsel in distress, whose only role beyond those is to use her research skills to help Harry be a more powerful wizard. She never even tries to, say, learn the wandless magic that Harry is practicing, much less succeed. Does this fic manage to avoid that?
