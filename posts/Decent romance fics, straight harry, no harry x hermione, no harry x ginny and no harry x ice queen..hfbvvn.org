**** This fic is set a few years after Hogwarts. So I believe that would make Gabrielle 16 (or older). In addition I don't remember if it uses the common veela trope of veela looking much younger than they are until they are able to handle their allure and then their looks quickly catch up. (I.e., That at the tournament Gabrielle was really 12-13 but looked 8)

#+begin_quote
  Harry has a long and difficult path to overcoming not only Lord Voldemort, but also his trauma from his treatment at the hands of the Dursleys. AU with the story starting at 4th year. Harry/Fleur. This story deals seriously with abuse, which can be difficult for some readers. It has been rated accordingly.
