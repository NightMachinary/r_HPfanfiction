** I'm not going to bother with spoiler tags since this is a thread about the movie, so beware.

Firstly: retconning McGonnagal's age is just pointless fanservice for no reason. According to JK on Pottermore (lol), Accio is only for inanimate objects and summons them at "near lightspeed" (double lol). In the new movie that she was part of producing, a Niffler, among other things, are Accio'd. Fun.

The Blood Oath completely undermines Dumbledore's character. Am I mistaken in feeling like what was sort of implied in DH was that Dumbledore didn't move against Grindelwald because of their past together? His regret, their relationship, you know, actual character flaws?

Now he's just bound by an oath he made as a foolish young man. Complete garbage. Was that added just so the Niffler could do something plot-relevant to justify the movie being called "Fantastic Beasts"? Which brings me to the point that the beasts in this movie was just filler.

Nagini had no place in this movie. Either commit to flesh out her character and by result Prudence, but they just had her there for.. what reason, exactly? Two lines and a hug?

I dislike Flamel being an old, frail man, but alright.

Grindelwald. Is JK just completely unable to write compelling antagonists? In advance of the movie I was very disappointed with the whole pureblood supremacy shtick we saw in trailers, just doing Voldemort all over again. It almost felt in this movie like it would be different, but then we get a scene where Grindelwald in private very implicitly suggests he believes in it, and we even get a scene where he pointlessly has a family killed (with a /non-verbal/ killing curse?!), to parallel Voldemort further.

It's like JK and Hollywood are too cowardly to actually write a reasonable villain that does bad things for a good purpose. But a reasonable ruthless utilitarian villain would have just taken an empty house, obliviated the inhabitants and sent them onto the street, or kill them and vanish the bodies. The whole coffin show was just inane and trash.

We can't have a villain that rather reasonably is pro-Wizard supremacy because he has just seen a terrible world war and knows another, worse one, is coming soon. Oh noo, what if some viewers were too stupid to see through the downsides of the Greater Good and started symphatizing with the villain? We can't have that, have the bad guy force choke someone, quick.

Grindelwald could have been a fantastic villain. Instead he is just another one-dimensional trash villain for children and unfocused stupid cinema viewers. At least his speech was good, if someone makes a fan-cut without the stupid scenes undermining it, we could actually have a fantastic villain doing bad thing while believing himself the hero.

*** I've heard from everyone else that Grindlewald is compelling and that they understand why people are joining him. It's less about Purebloods and purity and more about the horrors of muggles and what they are becoming capable of.

I love Flamel being an old man, as it explains why he hasn't been very involved in decades... And why he is practically been forgotten. If he was a young immortal guy, everyone would know his name.

As for nagini, I feel like she is just an introduction here. My guess is she becomes important in the upcoming stories. I would rather have her do little here and slowly build her up instead of doing what Rowling did with Leta Lestrange... Finally introduced her, show her character building, not explain why she is dating his brother, and then promptly saves the day and dies. Not all characters need to have major plot points in a movie.

As for reconning... Yeah at this point I think Pottermore is no longer canon.

OP, I think a lot of fans dislike it because they have mental images of who characters are and what /should/ happen.

I loved the hell out of it, despite its flaws and so did my causal HP fan boyfriend. Rowling can do whatever she wants, it's her story.

I think we will end up liking this movie a lot more once we see the third-fifth.

What did Leta save? She traded her life for a cheap shot that didn't land. She didn't seem all that invested in opposing Grindelwald, but IIRC she went in for the kill after Credence joined Grindelwald? She's never even met the guy.

What a waste of a character. She was only there to give the Scamanders a personal revenge motivation for fighting Grindelwald, and was clumsily introduced in the film so that she wouldn't be a total blank slate at the moment of death.

He is still willing to die in order to stop voldemort. Who cares if he is in an old body vs young? It's the mind and personality that matters.

****** Because there's a difference between giving up an assured eternity that contained pleasures and thrills that would be able to fully enjoy, and giving up an eternal, and at least potientially torturous, existence where your body seems to be constantly nearing the edge of failure, staved off only by the Elixer.

Flamel's condition seems much more toward the "ironic genie's wish- you can love forever but it's a forever filled with suffering and your body breaking down like normal" end of the spectrum, rather than a life a person would actually wish to live.

And we have no reason to believe his condition got better as the decades marched on.

*** I just came back to this thread and I agree with everything you said but /especially/ the part about Nagini. I enjoyed the film, but I was so let down by the fact that they made all this fuss about Nagini being in the movie and being a woman and then !!! did fucking nothing with her. She had no scenes where she wasn't scared and confused. I get that with so many characters, it's had to give screentime to everyone, but if she's supposed to be one of the draws to the film, why basically sideline her? We don't know /anything about her/ aside from the fact that she was in Indonesia at one point and was in a cirque. How did she meet Credence? How did she get the blood curse? What possible motivation does she have to go with the Gang™️ to Hogwarts at the end of the movie? They were all strangers to her up until that point??

Nagini was by far the biggest disappointment of the movie.

** Since I don't think I can manage to suggest events and Characters: I feel like what they did with Leta was just to A) Create unfounded tension, B) Use her to try and tie the stories together. And C) create a more personal reason for Newt's involvement. Though I'd think that Queenie would've been good for that as well. Furthermore, Dumbledore seemed rather surprising on all sides: Ariana's death and his relationship with Grindelwald. Also, Proto-Order hints.

​

But I'll agree that overall this movie could've probably been skipped without losing much, maybe would've needed 15-20 minutes to explain a few things that happened off-screen.

** If I wasn't already firmly on the side of Death of the Author, this movie would cement that stance. As is, it's a further demonstration that JK has good ideas, but is often sloppy with execution. And she's a bad screenwriter. I will always appreciate her creating the Wizarding World, but capturing that lightning in a bottle doesn't mean I won't criticize her when it's deserved.

If she wanted to tell a prequel story of the Grindelwald conflict, she could have just done that. It doesn't mesh with the Fantastic Beasts angle. I, for one, would much prefer to see those movies focused on Dumbledore and Grindelwald (perhaps even show that infamous summer) than trying to make it work around another everyman protagonist.

The film is a mess of underdeveloped subplots that go nowhere, useless characters that are only there for fanservice and take away screentime from characters and plot threads that needed it instead. There are things I like about it, but my overall impression is negative. I can't say I enjoyed the movie as a whole.

I have no faith in Rowling's ability to unfuck this mess and bring it to a satisfying conclusion.

** I didnt hate it as much as I expected from the reviews I'd seen. There are a few interesting plot points introduced, though overall the movie falls into some of my least favorite tropes without any satisfying reason for it, ie the whole plot where Tina thinks Newt is engaged to Leta. It was pointless, and just to introduce tension where it just isn't needed and the part where Tina is now seeing some other Auror is completely ignored after the first half of the movie. I actually liked the Leta Lestrange character, she's interesting and has motivations I wish were better explored, though I have a weakness for family political drama. If shes really dead, which who the fuck knows constance was alive for plot reasons despite very obviously being dead in the first movie, it seems like a waste of so many opportunities. Shes basically the first protagonist slytherin character. I think we were all prejudiced against her due to her family and expected her to be evil, but shes actually pretty relate-able and a sympathetic character. Queenie's arc also makes no sense at all. At all. Dumbledore was also a mixed bag, I like the portrayal actually, though the costume design was awful. The blood oath thing is a nice take on why Dumbledore refuses to attack Grindlewald, though its a bit too convenient.

** It's a decent to good film with flaws. I just saw it literally two hours ago so I'm still processing it. As a standalone film I enjoyed it and thought it was fairly good with some plot holes/contrivances. As a HP/HPFF fan? There are things I started to read into too deeply, not enough, etc. The scene where Dumbledore convinces Newt to go to Paris? Obviously Manipulative!Dumbles rearing his head. Saw it with my dad since I was visiting my parents for the weekend and he said it best I think: these movies are more wordbuilding than standalone movies. So in my opinion they're good and they're bad. Good concepts in using magic and visualization of magic. Too much retconning to fully let slide. The titular Fantastic Beasts felt shoehorned in to an extent though they were good.

And so on. It's a mixed bag. Some good, some less so.

Human Nagini as a concept is abject garbage though.
