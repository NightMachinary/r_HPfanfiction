With Oz being a main character


** I don't know who Oz is, but the only readable HP/BtVS crossover I know of is linkffn(Uncle Quentin's Spy by Starfox5) --- but I haven't exactly spent a lot of time looking.

This isn't Oz centric, but it stood out enough for me to remember it 8 or so years later. [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-6136/Tassos+The+Flat+Next+Door.htm]]
