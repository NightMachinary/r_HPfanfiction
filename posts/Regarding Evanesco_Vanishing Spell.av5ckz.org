I am confused by the vanishing spell.From what I can glean from the books:

1. Both objects (e.g., potions) and living things can be vanished (e.g., Harry banishes a snail during class in OoTP, and an iguana during his O.W.L.s.; I think at some point in OotP Hermione vanishes a bird or cat.)
2. /Evanesco/ is supposed to be more difficult to accomplish the more complex the target is.
3. According to McGonagall's answer to the Ravenclaw door's riddle, objects that are vanished go "into non-being, which is to say, everything."

So here are my questions: what happens if you use /Evanesco/ on a living person? Why can't one use this on enemies to make them disappear? Do vanished objects ever just pop back into "being" without a counter being used? (I can't imagine, for example, that the potion of Harry's that Snape vanishes just appears again one day. I can't see him standing for that.)

And if for some reason one can't use it on enemies (e.g., it would be too difficult to accomplish if an enemy is in motion), then why, for example, can't Barty Crouch Jr. use it to dispose of his father's body? Sure, I imagine it's more difficult to use on humans, but 5th years were vanishing iguanas on their exams, so I imagine it should be possible for a somewhat talented Hogwarts graduate with a Transfiguration NEWT.

Your thoughts are appreciated.

Honestly, transfiguration difficulty makes no sense if you think about it (or it is completely world breaking). Hermione implies that size matters when talking about the dragon (there are two dirty jokes in that sentence).

Living beings are supposed to be difficult because they are complex. But even a single bacteria is way more complex than, for example, a car engine. Instead of simply steel/aluminium parts, you have semi-permeable membranes and even simple animals have multiple organs and countless cell types.

Complexity-wise, if you can change something in a rodent, you ought to be able to whip up a computer or a working car (possibly scaled down). The implications are world breaking if you think about the possible abuse. You can turn leaves into perfect copies of banknotes. You can create consumer electronics and sell them. Inanimate to inanimate would not be nearly as bad. Even self-transfiguration into other mammals (we have very similar internal layouts). But turning a goblet into a crow and the other way around raises so many questions and possibilities.

*** I hadn't considered it at all from this perspective, thanks. I mean, your ideas invalidate canon, but they also make more sense to me than canon. Your response made me think of /The Art of Self-Fashioning/ by Lomonaaeren (sp?), which goes into some detail about having to really understand the physiology of things to successfully transfigure them. At any rate, thanks.

** I have a theory. In Deathly Hallows, McGonagoll said that vanished objects go into non-being, which is to say, everything.

This immediately reminds me of quantum entanglement and quantum teleportation. Look them up. I won't go into detail about them, but did you notice in canon that an incorrectly vanished mouse will still have its tail wriggling?

Consider splinched apparition for example. When you splinch yourself, some of your body parts are left behind, yet they are connected or entangled to your original body. Sounds familiar right?

Yes, when you vanish some objects, those objects go into an intermediate state, like imagine the intermediate stage during apparition. That intermediate state where your body/object is converted into the form of quantum information before teleporting to the destination. This is supposed to be temporary and unstable state. But in vanishing, you are forcing the object to stay in this state that was supposed to be temporary, /permanently/. That's why vanishing big objects/living beings permanently is difficult. You can temporarily convert them into quantum information state/non-being state and use that for various applications like teleportation/apparition, but permanently putting them in that state is difficult for big objects.

Now can we retrieve vanished objects?

Yes and no. Yes, we can retrieve the objects if we still have the same clear picture in our mind, the same intent when you vanished it. But after few days or weeks? No. Unless you have eidetic memory, even then it would be extremely unlikely, as there is no guarentee that you would have exactl same mental state as when you have vanished that object.

What happens to living beings?

Now this is where everything become ambiguous. Can you really say that life force is nothing but sum of all the quantum states, quantum information? Can you be absolutely sure that when you are converted into information state, you won't die? Scientists believe that it is plausible. HP magic system says that it is possible. Else apparition etc. wouldn't work.

But then, can you /permanently/ put a human into the state of quantum information state/non-being state? Nope, it is extremely unlikely. And so is recovering a vanished Human. A fifth year can vanish Small living beings like slugs/rats with considerable to moderate difficulty. It becomes an entirely different ball park to even vanish a cat. It takes extreme talent to vanish a Snake.

But vanishing conjured objects/beings is easiest. Because they are basically created from non-being, they are supposed to be temporary, bringing back to their natural state is easy.

Yes, in the end, it's all about natural state.

** Yeah, vanishing is a rather difficult one to properly balance.

Fair warning, this is all head-canon.

As for doing it to a living person, for me it fits in with my reasoning for why wizards aren't just using other forms of transfiguration on each other mid-combat, or as an instant-win if they get the jump on the other.

Firstly, doing such magic on another living magical being is far more difficult than it is on non-magical things. Vanishing 200lbs of random junk at once is much easier than doing it to a person. Second, wizards are able to internally resist and counter things that try to influence them internally like that. It's even an instinctive automatic response, and they can put further efforts into it. So trying to vanish someone who's asleep is a easier than someone who's awake, and that's easier than someone who's awake and paying attention, and that's easier than someone who is alert to the fact that you're hostile. Etc.

That being said, I would say that vanishing someone /is/ possible, but that it's so difficult that picking another option would always be better. For example, Dumbledore/Voldemort could vanish a young student pretty easily, but an alert adult wizard may be impossible for them. Or it might exhaust them. I had actually been meaning to make a request about this, because I think it sounds funny. Someone is unaware of his presence but is annoying Voldemort. Voldemort flicks his wand in the guy's direction and he just fucking /disappears/.

Again I view this has sharing the limitation of more regular forms of transfiguration. A vanished object can spontaneously reappear, but that just means it wasn't cast properly or powerfully enough. Similarly, transfigured objects might spontaneously revert to their original form, but if it was done properly then the change is permanent.

This, though... I don't have an answer for this lol. Good question, I don't know why I haven't considered it. Even if we say that a human corpse is simply too large, you should be able to cut it up and vanish the pieces. I'll have to think on it. Might have to readjust my entire transfiguration head-canon. Damn.

Hmm. Maybe vanishing something as large as an adult body is essentially impossible. And cutting it up to vanish the pieces doesn't work because there's a sort of magical meta-connection that the body has, so a vanished piece will just unvanish almost immediately, pulled back into being by its connection to the rest of the corpse.

Yeah, I dunno'. I'll have to think about it some more. We could always just say that's just another unexplained example of characters not using magic to its full potential.

Yes! This is one of the reasons I thought of the question. Also, if Voldemort was scared of killing Harry...just vanish him. Problem solved. (Though the post above about quantum entanglement might make this complicated.) I also like your idea about internal resistance.

I also hadn't even considered the possibility of cutting up body parts, but it's a good (if macabre) solution to the potential size problem (even though I suspect that a 200 lb body would be doable for a good wizard).\\
Thanks for the response!

**** Well.. I don't think that work around works. Vanishing Harry should definitely count as killing him. It's also a harder and more roundabout way of doing things, so I imagine Voldemort would worry that doing that is more likely to invoke some prophetic fuckery.

What most bothers me about wizards being able to vanish corpses willy nilly is that I'm not sure how law enforcement could deal with it. Maybe it's just damned difficult to do on that level, and the murder-wizards capable of it are just that hard to find evidence against.

No problem!

***** Thanks :) I actually meant to delete the bit about Harry because I realized the problem, but I guess I only got half of it. Still, the point about law enforcement is good. The whole spell just bugs me, but I'm trying to do something with it in a fic and I can't get my head around its limitations.

****** Hm. I guess the law enforcement problem of vanishing isn't really any different from regular transfiguration. If a wizard turns a corpse into a marble and takes it to dispose of it elsewhere, that's not much better.

Magical detectives must have it rough.

** Vanishing large objects/people is difficult enough that they built cabinets to do it for them.

I also suspect that having a soul helps a lot with things like resisting spells or reforming ones self post-vanishment, while lesser creatures are out of luck. Iirc, Montague vanished for a week and then showed up somewhere random in the castle.
