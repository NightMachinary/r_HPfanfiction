I'm looking for fics where characters fall under the enchantment of a fleur (or any veela) and they're manipulated/taken advantage of. Something akin to the French affair, though a little darker-natured.

I'm talking about a fleur who is ooc, abusing and manipulating everyone with her allure for her own ends, and specifically one where harry/the main character is susceptible to said enchantment.

It seems like a very interesting dynamic to me that I've seen done in a few fics (with love potions), but I've abjectly failed to find anything really in the scope that I'm looking for - not sure if it's because it simply doesn't exist, or because I've failed to search adequately. Searching fanfiction is always kind of tricky in that regard.


** Ive read several fics where harry ends up with veela power and abuses that, but never saw it where hes a victim of the allure, probably due to most fanfic of that nature being some variation of power fantasy/wish fulfillment.

*** I'm not specifically necessarily looking for a weak Harry - hell, a powerful-but-weak-minded Harry could be a similarly interesting dynamic - something akin to him being used specifically for his power.

Alas, I'm inclined to agree - the majority of fanfics of this genre tend to be, as you said, power fantasies or wish fulfillment, so it's more than possible that what I'm looking for simply has never been written.

** Closest i can think of is linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152930/1/Dagger-and-Rose]]). Not really evil, but definitely antagonist, from what i can remember. Dont want to say more in fear of spoilers.

Edit: looking at it, the story is tagged as being harry/fleur, so it is probable that my memory is wrong

*** I read this one. Its not anything to do with a veela misusing their powers as far as i remember. There is forced control going on though, its just not via a veela's powers. And the forced control gets pretty evil.

Here are some big spoilers that i remember: [[/spoiler][Harry and Fleur grow close, at first because fluer is ordered to and later because they are in love. Fleur is trapped by her fiance, who somehow had a blood magic tattoo thing that forced her to do his wishes. He gets jealous of Harry, rapes Fleur using his control, and harry duels him to the death in the forbidden forest or something. There is a lot of other intrigue and training going on too]].

**** Yes, I think it was the intrigue going on that made me think of this story. Intrigue != Evil, but maybe intrigue = manipulative.

***** Iirc the intrigue is plots and counter plots in this story. More like a series of spy games.

The manipulation is less manipulation and more orders that some character is forced to follow by some form of control. Some orders are followed willingly, others less so.

Honestly, I loved the fic up until the rape scene. I just can't enjoy fics with that as a major plot point (or really any plot point). Makes me too angry for what is meant to be a relaxing pastime. Ill finish them if i got invested before it happened (like this one), but i avoid them normally

*** If I remember correctly, Dagger and Rose is more of a traditional love story with [[/spoiler][Fleur being forced against her will to act against Harry via familial magics of some kind.]]
