:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember this fic where Harry was some kind of genius, who passed secondary school before Hogwarts and made these runes (rune combos? rune clusters? runic arrays?) that would allow technology to work with magic. He was also good with tech and various electronics. I think he sent them to MIT or something in exchange for information? I don't really remember it all that well. I know it's not Rune Stone Path or Power of the Mind. My Google-Fu skills have failed me so if anyone has any suggestions or know what fic I'm talking about I'd really appreciate it, thanks.


** Sounds like you might be thinking of a combination of fics. But it really sounds like linkffn(The Tinkerer)

Yeah it's possible, they all sort of blur together after a while.

  The Dursley family, who valued normalcy above all else, would of course never dream of keeping their orphan nephew in a cupboard, or of making a spectacle of him. That isn't to say they wanted to spend all of their time and money on him, however. From the salvage of broken toys and unwanted junk, left alone to his own devices, Harry built dreams.

Is it the one where he links a rune to a paper on daphnes desk to talk to her?

Or is it another where he creates runic display thing for mirrors?

*** Either of them might be it. I know it's /not/ linkffn(Saviour of Magic), because SoM is very anti-Muggle/pro-Wizard, and it definitely wouldn't have that in.

  An intelligent, well-trained Boy Who Lived comes to Hogwarts and Albus Dumbledore is thrown for a loop. Watch as Harry figures out his destiny as a large threat looms over the horizon, unknown to the unsuspecting magical population. Would Harry Potter be willing to take on his role as the Saviour of Magic or would the world burn in his absence? Harry/Daphne. COMPLETE!
