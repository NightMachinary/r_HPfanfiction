** Please try to learn as much as you can about such a condition if you want to write a story about it.

You sound dangerously misinformed if you think sociopaths don't have any feelings. What you are thinking about are called Vulcans or certain types of extreme psychopathy maybe.

**** Depends on how good they are. They suppress or exert extreme control on their emotions, depending on how good they are. Maybe they'd just see the boggart in its 'base form' if such a thing exists.

***** I doubt they could lock their feelings away completely. I imagine the Boggart would be even more difficult for Vulcans to face due to their lack of practice in dealing with extreme emotion.

**** The characteristics of sociopathy, aka Antisocial Personality Disorder, according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition, are as follows:

A. Significant impairments in personality functioning manifest by:

1. Impairments in self functioning (a or b):

a.Identity: Ego-centrism; self-esteem derived from personal gain, power, or pleasure.

b.Self-direction: Goal-setting based on personal gratification; absence of prosocial internal standards associated with failure to conform to lawful or culturally normative ethical behavior.

AND

1. Impairments in interpersonal functioning (a or b):

a.Empathy: Lack of concern for feelings, needs, or suffering of others; lack of remorse after hurting or mistreating another.

b.Intimacy: Incapacity for mutually intimate relationships, as exploitation is a primary means of relating to others, including by deceit and coercion; use of dominance or intimidation to control others.

B. Pathological personality traits in the following domains:

1. Antagonism, characterized by:

a.Manipulativeness: Frequent use of subterfuge to influence or control others; use of seduction, charm, glibness, or ingratiation to achieve one's ends.

b.Deceitfulness: Dishonesty and fraudulence; misrepresentation of self; embellishment or fabrication when relating events.

c. Callousness: Lack of concern for feelings or problems of others; lack of guilt or remorse about the negative or harmful effects of one's actions on others; aggression; sadism.

d. Hostility: Persistent or frequent angry feelings; anger or irritability in response to minor slights and insults; mean, nasty, or vengeful behavior.

1. Disinhibition, characterized by:

a. Irresponsibility: Disregard for -- and failure to honor -- financial and other obligations or commitments; lack of respect for -- and lack of follow through on agreements and promises.

b. Impulsivity: Acting on the spur of the moment in response to immediate stimuli; acting on a momentary basis without a plan or consideration of outcomes; difficulty establishing and following plans.

c.Risk taking: Engagement in dangerous, risky, and potentially self-damaging activities, unnecessarily and without regard for consequences; boredom proneness and thoughtless initiation of activities to counter boredom; lack of concern for one's limitations and denial of the reality of personal danger.

C. The impairments in personality functioning and the individual's personality trait expression are relatively stable across time and consistent across situations.

D. The impairments in personality functioning and the individual's personality trait expression are not better understood as normative for the individual's developmental stage or sociocultural environment.

E. The impairments in personality functioning and the individual's personality trait expression are not solely due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., severe head trauma).

F. The individual is at least age 18 years.

TL;DR look up the medical definition of the mental condition and extrapolate from that.

Also, a lack of empathy does not mean a personal lack of feelings. It simply means he is unable identify with the feelings of others in a meaningful way. He is still plenty capable of getting angry, happy, sad, etc, it is simply more centered around himself.
