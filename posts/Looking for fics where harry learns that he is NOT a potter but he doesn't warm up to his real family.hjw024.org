Looking for fics where it is discovered harry is actually not a potter but a Malfoy or a Snape but he refuses to forgive or like his parents/family and for good reason as they have either bullied (Draco & snape) or tried to kill him. No matter how they feel about him now or how they regret their treatment of him

Have come across a few fics where harry is a missing malfoy but he forgives and warms towards them far too quickly for my taste.

Can be any family or any fic similar to what i have listes but ofc prefrence is towards a Malfoy or Severus Snape


** This one fits the bill

  Snape is Harry's father. No one is happy to hear it. [R due to colorful language, dark themes, and nongraphic violence.]

** I think Conditionally by Lomonaaeren went in that direction (it's a bio-dad Snape fic), but it's been a while since I read it.

I would also rec Changes of Fate by Slayer_of_Destiny. I wouldn't normally suggest a fic that's WIP with 5 chapters, but it is over 25,000 words and I really like it. I think it does a good job of showing Harry, Lucius and Narcissa struggling to developed a relationship, and there are definitely no quick fixes for Harry & Draco's relationship (that's the dynamic I like most).
