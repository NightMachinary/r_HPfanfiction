I'm looking for a fic I read a while ago, I don't really remember much about it. I know the main character was Harry's daughter but she was an original character, it wasn't Lily. I think she was dating Oliver Wood's son or they were interested in each other. And there was some sort of attack on the school from like Death Eaters but there was something different with them so they were really powerful or something. Also she was Fred's good friend but I think she was James's twin.


** I haven't read it, but it might be linkffn(The Fall of The Phoenix by IfIOnlyWereAWeasley)

  After the war, all the Potters & the Weasleys wanted was to live in peace. With Lord Voldemort defeated & his Death Eaters locked away, peace seemed inevitable. Then the Minister began releasing Death Eaters, people started disappearing again, & it suddenly looked as though the heroes' children were destined to follow in their parents' footsteps.
