The goblins announce that the enchantments on the mint are failing and they are unable to fix them, so the Minister (Kingsley?) asks Snape and Tonks to investigate the matter to find a way to avoid financial collapse. They are looking into the life of 19th century wizard who created the modern version of the mint the goblins are using. I remember them finding this wizard's daughter's letters in the house where the family used to live, but now it's a hotel (?). They piece together the details of the daughter's life (she managed her father's estate? created those enchantments herself? this I don't remember, but there certainly were some dark Victorian secrets) and in the end come to the conclusion that goblins manufactured the crisis to use their own magic to produce galleons.

I've read this fic on AO3 (?) a couple of years ago, but I can't seem to find it anymore.

  A sadder and a wiser Tonks after she survives the Battle of Hogwarts? No way. Back into the lists of love she goes ... with a bit more forethought than last time, but an even more awkward target.

*** Thank you!

I browsed the Snape/Tonks tag and looked through the summaries and additional tags twice, but missed it anyway, probably because the summary here is not very indicative of the mystery part of the plot.
