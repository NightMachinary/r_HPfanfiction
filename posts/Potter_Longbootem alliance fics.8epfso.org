are there any fics in which instead of Ron Weasley have Neville Longbottom, in which Neville teaches Harry all about Wizarding customs etc.

Preferably some bashing


** Seriously. You're back troll dude. Basically more than half of Weasley-bashing fics replace Ron with Neville. Marriage contract fics and Harry-is-powerwanking fics feature them being in an alliance and Longbottom teaching Harry some wizarding customs.
