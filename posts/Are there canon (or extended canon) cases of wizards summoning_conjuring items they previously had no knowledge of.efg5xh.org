Or do they need some level of knowledge about the item/materials/beings? If summoning, does the item/living being needs to be real?

Say, I'm a pureblood who has never heard of Tungsten of other stuff. Can I conjure items made of it? Or in another case, if /Serpensortia/ can summon a snake (Is a snake the same as a serpent in english?) Then could I use /Mi'gosortia/ (?) To summon a Mi'go?


** The only example coming to my mind is the wizard Baruffolo who accidentally conjured a buffalo... We don't have buffalo in England and I doubt the bloke was well travelled

*** I don't think so, since the sword was linked to the hat, and it wasn't /Harry/ who got it, but the hat who handed it to him.

** I feel like as long as you visualize the intended result and use the correct spell, magic takes care of the details... so if a pureblood with no knowledge of chemistry Conjured something that has tungsten in it, it'd work? but I assume you would need to create a completely new spell (whatever the process for that may be) to conjure a Mi'go or whatever it is?

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mi-Go][fictional race of extraterrestrials]]

/The "Mi-Go" are large, pinkish, fungoid, crustacean-like entities the size of a man; where a head would be, they have a "convoluted ellipsoid" composed of pyramided, fleshy rings and covered in antennae. They are about five feet (1.5 m) long, and their crustacean-like bodies bear numerous sets of paired appendages. They possess a pair of membranous bat-like wings which are used to fly through the "aether" of outer space/
