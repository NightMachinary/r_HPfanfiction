It's a humor fic, played straight. Picture a tv comedy that's kind of ridiculous, but is very good about being consistent in characterization and plot details.

*** I know of one where, after hearing the prophecy, Voldie decides he's given up so much to be alive already, and that he could give up England too. Who needs servants, an army or a country? He'd rather be alive, so he cuts his losses and quits as dark lord. He just up and moves to an island to wait ten centuries for the world to forget him.

I couldn't find the link tho', so I hope somebody else can.

****** It's meh. It's a huge author wank by Eliezer Yudkowsky who uhh is a divisive personality. I'm definitely more on the against side but I read the whole fic and most of it while it was a WIP and I used to think the author was one of the most interesting guys I'd ever heard of. It's kinda the daddy Rational fic similar to the Wave Arisen for the Naruto fandom (pretty good tbh) or the Metropolitan Man for Superman (actually freaking excellent, I'm not even into DC stuff) and there are various web originals that have a similar "Rational" aesthetic that are pretty great but I just overall kinda hate HPMOR in retrospect

****** If you didn't reach chapter 22, here's my favorite introduction:

/Something, somewhere, somewhen, must have happened differently.../

PETUNIA EVANS married Michael Verres, a Professor of Biochemistry at Oxford.

HARRY JAMES POTTER-EVANS-VERRES grew up in a house filled to the brim with books. He once bit a math teacher who didn't know what a logarithm was. He's read /Godel, Escher, Bach/ and /Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases/ and volume one of /The Feynman Lectures on Physics/. And despite what everyone who's met him seems to fear, he doesn't want to become the next Dark Lord. He was raised better than that. He wants to discover the laws of magic and become a god.

HERMIONE GRANGER is doing better than him in every class except broomstick riding.

DRACO MALFOY is exactly what you would expect an eleven-year-old boy to be like if Darth Vader were his doting father.

PROFESSOR QUIRRELL is living his lifelong dream of teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts, or as he prefers to call his class, Battle Magic. His students are all wondering what's going to go wrong with the Defense Professor this time.

DUMBLEDORE is either insane, or playing some vastly deeper game which involved setting fire to a chicken.

DEPUTY HEADMISTRESS MINERVA MCGONAGALL needs to go off somewhere private and scream for a while.

Presenting:

HARRY POTTER AND THE METHODS OF RATIONALITY

You ain't guessin' where this one's going.

** So in Wolf Lord, this is referenced sorta in a single moment where Remus mentioned the material left behind by Quirrell is halfway decent and what he is going to be building his own classes off of since he got the job a month before it started.

​

I feel like Voldemort wouldn't let Quirrell do a terrible job as a teacher and wouldn't worry about any student, not matter how well taught, being an actual threat to him. The stuttering was a cover and the garlic hid the smell, but I imagine Quirrell was probably a pretty decent teacher when you weren't being legitimized all class.
