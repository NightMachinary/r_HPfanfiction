Harry Potter is not strong enough to beat Voldemort. Harry knows it, Voldemort knows it, and Albus Dumbledore knows it. One option is to trust in some obscure wandlore/blood magic/soul magic/self sacrifice loophole, but Dumbledore has his doubts. That's why, in Harry's sixth year he and Dumbledore agree to swap bodies using a potion, so that Dumbledore can use his knowledge and power to catch Voldemort by surprise. Unfortunately, it's going to take time for Albus to adjust to Harry's body and magic in order to be able to fight. So for one week they'll have to live in each others bodies and avoid drawing any attention that could tip off Voldemort.

For the first time in almost a century, Albus finds himself taking classes at Hogwarts, with a suspicious Hermione watching him. While an out of his depth Harry must juggle staff meetings and Order business.

** There was this one Naruto fanfic I read that my mind instantly jumped to when I read the title of this post. In it, the Hokage transformed himself into Naruto to see how abusive the village was and nearly died because of it. It made me think, what if Dumbledore took some modified polyjuice potion to spend a week in Harry's shoes, only to find himself with SuperAbusive!Dursleys?

** This sounds incredible. I could see an author taking this in a serious way where this is a last ditch effort to prevent a war or a comedic route with both of them totally out of there league.

*** I think it would work well as a serious breakthrough attempt to have Harry survive and end the war. I also think it would work well as a cracky fun fic.
