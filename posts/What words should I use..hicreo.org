I am an American writing a Harry Potter fanfic and I am asking what type of words should I use in the fanfic. After all, British English and American English have some differences, so what spellings should I use and what more British words should I use instead of more American ones?

Thanks in advance

***** The author tries to take account of that but still gets things wrong. But not wrong enough to be jarringly weird if someone follows their advice.

****** There are some very jarring mistakes, but I would say that it's also written from quite a specific perspective - someone whose lived in Scotland for a few decades and is around 55.

** If you look at the writing center -- desktop sidebar (mobile: menu --> our wiki) -- there's a link to a rather useful "Britpicking" guide. It is very long and extensive, though thankfully there are links at the top to jump to sections.

** An odd one I keep coming across is bitumen on roads. We use a different composition called tarmac.
