Spoiler warning. This is linked to chapter 26 of the 4th story in a series of 5 stories in the series. please take that into considerations when reading this.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11139302/26/The-Fourth-School]] in a story called 'the Fourth School by Stargon1, part of a series of stories set in the same universe. I didn't expect much in this series but it is turning out to be fairly entertaining. The setup begins about halfway through. I rarely LOL but this one made me.


** The whole premise of this "book" made no sense to me. McGonagall is so disenchanted with Dumbledore's actions that she actually helps Harry start a new magical school, and then is like "Oh, Albus invited us back to Hogwarts where he has total control of the wards/paintings/elves/etc. I'm sure it'll be fine. Let's go!"

*** Every single character in this series is an idiot. So the premise makes perfect sense to me. Someone idiotic does something stupid.

** In all my years of reading fanfiction, this 'molly&Dumbledore betrothal scam' has never ended well. Or started well, for that matter. Not once.

The idea's just dumb as fuck.

** This series had potential but stargon1 just piled shitty cliche upon shitty cliche so the potential charm of the story itself was eclipsed by a literal metaphorical shittonne of excrement.

** Mugwamp? Like, /really/?

My tablet predicted "Mugwumps" every time that I just tried to type that, so surely it's not too obscure to not show up in a spell-checker?

** what I liked about this one is how it got turned around on them, where they lose big time, if they follow through with it.
