After Voldemort, Harry becomes an Auror/ adventurer/ travels the world/ learns awesome magic / becomes the best professor ever at Hogwarts/ or whatever constitutes a fulfilling life that prepares him to be really OP in the actual story before he travels dimensions or gets reincarnated.

So I'd really like to read a story where after Voldemort, Harry actually has a great life, preferably one that focuses on worldbuilding, fantasy, magic and adventure rather than relations, drama or angst (not that the story can't have both).

  Reborn after my embarrassing fall at Godric's Hollow as the Potter brat was an interesting experience. Getting sorted into Hufflepuff, even more so. But reborn as the Lord of Winterfell in Westeros as my playground? Now that was new, even to a retired Dark Lord.

  His will is the blade in which the coming tide shall fall upon. His duty, the armor that gives him purpose and strength to fight on. His blood the unbreakable shield against the coming darkness. His soul, the last bastion, forged in the furnaces of war. So beware enemies of the North, for the Alpha Wolf has arrived, the North never forgets, and Winter is inevitable.(AU)(TempHiatus)

  “You understand, Professor,” Harry began, after a moment, “that I don't have my N.E.W.T.s. I never even finished seventh year. Between everything, I never had a chance the first time around, and then afterwards there didn't seem to be much point. Hermione argued for it, of course, but I was so tired of Britain. So technically, I am completely unqualified for the position.”“Quite a way to begin an interview, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said, dryly.Or, three years after the war, Harry Potter becomes Hogwarts' newest Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.
