Looking for fics in which the Cursed Child is sort of in universe play, and the main characters of the series go to see it, or something along those lines.


** I WANT THIS!

  “I did WHAT?” said Ron with disgust in his face.

However, please, keep to the rules of linkao3(A Dramatic Reading by White_Squirrel): just minimal quoting, only when needed, and to have some actual (at least minimal) story of your own. I know the opposite stories (ehm, linkao3(Reading the books - Sorcerer's Stone by spirithorse16) and its sequels) and the result is quite horrific.

  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.
