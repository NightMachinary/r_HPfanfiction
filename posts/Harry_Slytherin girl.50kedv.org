Ive read most Harry/Daphne but is there anything in the same boat that may be overlooked

Bonus for any other Gryffindor/Slytherin relationships that are realistic

*** It's such a good premise too. Harry, the boy who makes rash decisions and generally doesn't think things through, the Boy Who Lived and Gryffindor through and through...

Goes out with a girl from the other camp, a girl who is cunning, and thinks before she acts.

You could have it that her parents disapprove of her relationship to make the Romeo & Juliet theme complete.

**** That is what is so attractive about the premise. The fact that it's breaking year old boundaries between Slytherin and Gryffindors..

  A story about Harry in Slytherin house wielding the elder wand and the powers of an elemental. Features annoying Weasley's, an OFC, a flawed but good Dumbledore, an indifferent Snape and lots and lots of twists.

*** I'm still a huge fan of that fic. It does definitely show its age, in the sense that by today's standards it's riddled with clichés. But many of those clichés were new when the story was originally published. I think it might actually have been the first story that used the "Pansy is hiding under a glamour" trope.
