Harry Potter is raised by Voldemort and is basically an assassin, his parents are still alive and they have another kid I think. Harry tries to kill James, get captured, but they basically try to make him good again. Been looking for it for ages.

  What if Wormtail hadn't told Lord Voldemort the Potters hideout. What if he took Harry straight to him instead? A Dark Harry fanfic. AU Mild HG
