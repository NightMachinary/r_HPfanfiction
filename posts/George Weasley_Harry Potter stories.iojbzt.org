Hi!

I'm wondering if someone has some good recommendations for this pairing? They fascinate me endlessly, but I"ve only found a handful of stories worth reading, including:

Finding George by Juxtaposedsoul

Hopelessly devoted to you by Witchcraft

upon this tidal wave of young blood by ghoulfern

May Contain Nuts by scoradh

Maybe by Vorabiza

No Solace In Solitude by Llaeyro

But, Harry, it's George by Biza

HP loves GW by twoseas

I found these on AO3, as trying to filter for anything decent on FF.net has become too daunting. I hope anyone else has a suggestion, because I'm fairly content starved and on the brink on just writing for the pairing myself (if I weren't already up to my neck in unfinished stories). Thank you!

  Harrie knows better than to believe in soulmate-assigning geese. But when one such flock decides her mate is George Weasley, she doesn't manage to fight fate very hard this time around.
