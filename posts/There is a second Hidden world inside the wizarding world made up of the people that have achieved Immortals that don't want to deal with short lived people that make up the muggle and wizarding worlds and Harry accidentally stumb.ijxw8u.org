The reason they hide from the wizarding world is the same one that Hagrid gives harry in the first Book about why the wizarding world hides from the muggle one, they don't want the short Lived magical running to them every time they have a Problem.

As for the Flames they as the newest set of Immortals were serving their stint as the liaison between the Immortals and wizarding worlds.and Harry's First year was them faking there deaths so they could join the Immortals world full time.

The liaison between the two world after the Famel's is very happy their stint as the newest Immortal and liaison between wrold ended so quickly and immediately fobs the job off onto harry.


** This would be really interesting to explore. How exactly does a society of immortals work? Do the people have to work for money? Probably not. Would they all just spend their time hanging out in a castle doing stuff to stave of the boredom?

*** Presumably, it's a bunch of people living wherever they want doing whatever they want and in general trying to amuse themselves without getting involved in the dealings of mortals. They will have gone beyond most personal connections except between themselves and their self policing to prevent a reveal would be ruthless. Flamel is literally on probation for being exposed. Voldemort was on a shortlist, but he's too political for them. Some of them are having the time of their lives researching stuff or doing (relatively) odd jobs. Others are trolling the ever loving f### out of the globe. And Harry got the invite, got the orientation package and is sort of going around dazed af without a clue about how he's going to stay under the radar as a world famous dark lord defeater....at least until enough time has passed

  Harry is invited in the Gobstones Club, a club that has, apparently, not invited anyone else since Albus Dumbledore.

*** This story was stupid. Incredibly stupid. I love it. xD Nicholas Flamel is known worldwide for creating a thing that grants immortality, but 99% of immortals are just immortal cause, woops. That is so silly, and I love it.

** Its a beautiful idea, I've read a great story where Harry was a Mage. And the few who knew thought it was like a chance to see the upbringing of another Merlin. But as Harry is taught by Flamel at his last year or so until he finally succumbs to death, he tells Harry there are over a Hundred Mages in the World, some even younger than Harry. I liked that, in the sense that a wand wasnt needed and some magic was different for the individual. It was a rune engraved on body Blood magic Harry who was raised in a small family of street kids by an kind old guy who also was in a secret group to study and fight against wizards. Chance encounter of it all. But being that there is a third party in the world that niether muggle nor magical knew about, this one being more realistic in a modern age, was refreshing to read.

** I read a fic that leans towards this vein with a SI!OC lawyer who basically possessed the Dursleys to force them to be more pleasant towards Harry and eventually interacts with the Flamels because the OC became immortal as part of the self-insertion. I stopped reading it because the fic started to make me uncomfortable with the OC going dark
