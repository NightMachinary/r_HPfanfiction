Lately, I've had a craving for that terrible genre of Lily and James come back to life.

A while ago, I read a specific one, where they both came back. I don't remember a lot about the fic, but the big things I recall are

1. Both Lily and James come back to life at the same time

2. Somehow, James becomes Minister of Magic

3. They have to flee to France at some point

4. I'm fairly certain that it is post-GoF.

Fics it is NOT

Blood Binding by SphinxScribe

That one weird one where James was sent to Hell by Voldemort, and comes back 14 years later because Wormtail spilled a potion.

Blank Slate by tresmarauder

The Wish by The Dork Knight

Thanks!


** I don't remember the full plot of this one, but could it be !linkffn(6780275) ?

  "Lily, it's him! Take Harry and run!" It began the same way, but ended in a very different way. This change caused life instead of death for many. Life altering changes provide the Power The Dark Lord Knows Not. J/L, H/Hr
