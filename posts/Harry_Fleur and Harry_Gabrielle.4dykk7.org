  Harry had no idea why the boys in the Great Hall drooled over themselves as the students from Beuxbatons made their entrance, but he knew better than to let an opportunity slip. He hurriedly stole Ron's sandwich. It tasted gloriously.

Haha you called it! Still, the age difference between Fleur and Harry is not as bad as the difference between Harry and Gabrielle...

And yet the latter two are most likely closer in age than Fleur and Bill. Obviously H/F and H/G can work fine, just not at the times and places they're usually set. I mean you could just replace Ginny with Gabrielle in the epilogue and it'd work just as well (or just as badly). You might have to make their kids a bit younger, but other than that ...

**** Exactly. I find most Harry/Gabrielle stories either change her age or after they "veela bond" she goes through some kind of rapid maturation. I just try and forget about the age difference when I read them. If their both older though, the age difference doesn't bug me. It's like Remus and Tonks but 14 year old Harry with a 7 year old Gabrielle is a bit much. I love Harry/Fleur though. Probably my favorite pairing other than canon.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

Harry / the narrator just has this perfect dry & sarcastic way of delivering the story. It is just perfect. I love how Fleur is written in this too. I usually don't like Ron that much and even he has his moments in this fic, so if you don't mind some smut, I would very much recommend it.
