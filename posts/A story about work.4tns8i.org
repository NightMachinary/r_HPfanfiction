Any stories that focus on the jobs of one (or more) of the golden trio? I'd love to read about the everyday life of them after the war is over.

Bonus points if the job isn't 'auror'.


** I'd like to read a fanfic that follows Hermione's rise to Minister of Magic.

*** Seconded. I think it would be really fascinating for the author to flesh out post-war attitudes toward Muggle-borns and how slowly (or quickly) they change in order to allow her to be a serious contender for the post.

**** I have read many postwar canon-compliant fics. Most of them are focused on Harry and Ginny, a few on Hermione's family life. Not a single one has done a good job describing what Hermione is doing on her job.

*** Personally I don't think that Hermione would be the best Minister of Magic. I really do think that she is to, "Extreme". I think she'd be better as an advisor to a half-blood Minister who has knowledge and experience in both the Magic and Muggle world and had a Pureblood advisor as well. Or at least a Magical raised Half blood who cares about preserving magical tradition. I just really think that Hermione would be overly radical as Minister and would try to change too much with little care about tradition. Sure plenty of the magical world needs updating but heedlessly diving in would just alienate people and cause bigger issues.

****** Maybe I sounded too harsh, but I don't think much of magical Britain's tradition. It's pretty much dark age ideology full of bigotry, corruption, cruelty, discrimination, injustice, and malice. The blood purity was an especially misguided and dangerous idea that would lead Magical Britain to full mental degeneration and terminal inbreeding, like the Spanish Habsburg: [[http://i.imgur.com/ofLX7.png]]

******* Nah, don't worry you didn't come off harsh.

The blood purity stuff is absolutely dumb and dangerous. Although I can't think of any off the top of my head, as the wider world of Harry Potter was left relatively sparse, I'm sure that there are traditions and aspects of Wizarding Culture that a Muggleborn would dismiss that are actually culturally enriching things.

** There's a few in my faves. There's a great incomplete where he's a big game hunter. There's a black comedy where harry's a thief and politician which is tautology. There's hermioen and the marriage revolution which follows their ministry careers.

And in my head there's one where he runs a pie shop in new york and works with a snarky detective to solve murders while having orgies with models who love how he smells like food that they can never eat.
