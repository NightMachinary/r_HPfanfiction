No LOTR, unless it's fairly new. I think I've read all the elfling!Harry fics worth reading.

Something I've enjoyed:

HP/DN

** De-aged and xo? I don't think I've ever read any.

But then, I don't read much xos, as they tend to be Main Character A fucks Main Character B or Main Character A is saved by Main Character B-sue.
