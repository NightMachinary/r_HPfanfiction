I have had this idea in my head for awhile and kinda started planning it out so I am going to lay it out for you guys and ask for some feedback on it. I am looking for any suggestions or things you might add or take away etc.

So I don't think another fanfiction that I know have has done this but I could be wrong. This fic probably will be a harem fic sort of.

What I mean by that is that Harry is going to have 7 girls he has to marry before a certain date say his birthday. But at the same time I am going also focus on other main characters and their relationship. For example, Hermione, Ron, Draco etc.

Unlike in other fics, these relationships will not be in the background really as I will spend time developing these.

I also plan to have Voldemort of course as the fic will start in Harry's 6th year and go to I am not exactly sure when. I will incorporate the usual battles, occlumency, and other stuff you see in other fics basically focusing on the war.

So here are pairings:

Harry Potter:

1. Pansy Parkinson (kinda switching it up from other fics)

2. Lavender Brown (She could use some love. She will not be a slut in this fic as she was in some other fics I have read.)

3. Nymphadora Tonks (Hey, older woman kinda my thing)

4. Astoria Greengrass (I see Daphne a lot so I am going with her sister.

5. Katie Bell (Under used in my opinion)

6. Susan Bones (redhead)

7. ??? (Kind of unsure at the moment maybe one of the Patils, or Luna. Open to suggestions)

Hermione Granger

I decided not to have her paired with Harry because I read a lot of Harmony and frankly I have had enough for awhile. I am thinking of pairing her with either Colin Creevey (younger guy/older girl) or Dean Thomas.

Ron Weasley:

1. Cho Chang (He is used to getting hand-me downs lol)

Neville Longbottom: (probably will not focus on this relationship as much since i will mainly cover the Golden Trio but nonetheless). I think Neville is kind of badass so he will get two girls.

1. Daphne Greengrass

2. Tracey Davis

Ginny Weasley:

I am going to have Ginny Weasley not have a steady boyfriend but sleep around with a bunch of different guys.

1. Draco Malfoy- He will have a girlfriend after Ginny gets a hold of him

2. Lee Jordan

3. Cormac McClaggen (Disgusting)

4. Michael Corner

5. Roger Davies & Zacharias Smith (at the same time o.O)

6. Severus Snape ??? (Debating, also open to suggestions)

7. Crabbe and Goyle ??? (same time again still debating)

On a side note, will try to go after Harry as well although no love potions or anything like that,

Draco Malfoy:

I was thinking maybe Luna Lovegood Hannah Abbot, one of the Patils, or maybe even Fleur. (This is also up for debate)

The following will be mostly in the background.

Fred & Angelina

George & Alicia

A couple of notes:

1. Draco is on the side of the Light

2. Dumbledore will not be bashed but may make a few poor decisions when it comes to Harry or already has. Ex: Putting Harry with Dursleys

3. I just basically spewed this onto the page so I apologize if it is confusing in any way. I look forward to feedback and ideas.


** And what is the story? Like why does anything happen? What is the goal? "I'll pair of Harry to a bunch of girls" maybe does make for a good wank-fic, but nothing more.

What you have to consider is also that with 7 girls there are 8 people in relationship with each other.

8 people means 8 * 9 / 2 = 36 relationships. 36 relationships that you have to keep track of in the harem alone.

Astoria started Hogwarts at 1993 - two years after Harry - so she is around fourteen. That's very young for marriage, especially with everyone between two (Pansy, Susan) and nine (Tonks) years older. Oh yeah, Tonks is seven years older than Harry.

How will the relationship between Tonks and Astoria be? Between Tonks and Susan? I mean her aunt - that she lives with - is her boss. And Voldemort has a thing for killing Bones. He killed Susan's parents personally, and her aunt in HBP too. How will that affect her? How can Harry protect her? And what's the relationship between Lavender and Pansy?

This is a lot to keep track off, and then you still want to add story. You'll either make the girls flat and equal in some way - or the story will come to a halt. I mean I only thought about it for a second and that is chapters of character development just in the paragraph above.

And that is only the main thing. You say that Draco is on the side of the light, but that doesn't mean much in itself. Is he a spy? Will he turn on his father? How will that work out? How will Voldy react, considering Draco was marked in the summer leading up to HBP?

That alone is quite a lot to deal with.

Portraying Dumbledore that way is fine, but also extremely boring imo. But again, it means nothing. How will the relationship between Dumbledore and Harry be? How will Dumbledore act?

What exactly is the goal with your fic? All I see here are a few ideas scribbled down without a coherent plot - and the idea's aren't actually that good or new.

I mean if you want to write it, by all means do so. Writing is always fun and ultimately it's your story, not mine!

But you asked for feedback, and my feedback is that I see major problems with it.

*** I see what you are saying. I have a lot of planning left as there a lot of stuff left to figure out but I hope to have a lot of these holes filled and maybe change courses with some of these ideas mainly the Dumbledore one. Its just that I have read a lot of fics where Dumbledore is very controlling so much that its his way or the highway. So yeah I know this fic doesn't sound that great at this point of time but I hope to make at least enjoyable. Thanks!

** 1st. No to the Harem idea, Harem fics don't work for anything other than bad and pointless smut. Real Smut needs to be done with REAL Emotion, and you can't coax it out when multiple girls are on screen with the same cookie cutter personality and all trying to get one guy like this is some Japan shit. No, Harems are dumb.

2nd. You've given a couple pairings, but then in the notes you seem to follow the sanctions of canon. If I have to read one more time about how annoyed Harry is about being with the Durselys, I'm just going to start Xing out of any fics that have that at this point. It's so overused and unneeded. Yea, we get that he wasn't loved, move on with it. (Note: Might be different with Multibook Multiyear Projects as that actually matters.)

3rd. >Draco light side >Neville pairing >Ginny pairing >Ron pairing, you're trying to do too much and trying to fuck with everything. You need to focus on one character and build that person up with supplementary commentary for character development of other characters. Relationships have to be organic, Neville isn't Magically getting pussy because the author wants it, likewise for Harry in canon, because that wasn't realistic. Sure girls can pine after a guy but they won't do shit unless he makes the first move, this is the classic move a story being created by a virgin.

4th. "Harry has to marry x amount of x." Marriage contracts are dubious and make no sense, if there is a marriage contract going back centuries then someone would have already filled out the requirements, even if accidentally. Next, we have the idea that it was James and Lily that did it, but that's stupid because there is no way either would agree with it. James disliked tradition on principle because that is what got Sirius burnt from the family tree. And Lily is very hardcore about being a Mama Bear.

** I'm going to be honest, OP. Your story is most likely fucked from the beginning if it's a harem - and I'm not including the details you later put down. Furthermore, the ideas are completely unoriginal, burnt out, and boring. Finally, you don't seem to have a coherent plot or outline created. What exactly do you want to happen in your story? I find it helpful to have at least a basic outline when writing, in order to keep myself on track.

Seven girls is simply too much, whether your story includes smut or not. And a Draco/Fleur pairing is probably the most out of character pairing I've ever seen, and I've seen some whacky stuff.

Nevertheless, good luck with your writing. Write what /you/ want and enjoy.

** Seven pairings isn't enough. I think if you added a few more, the story would be more interesting. May I also suggest:

- Harry/Luna

- Harry/Padma

- Harry/Narcissa

- Harry/Molly

- Harry/Arthur

- Harry/Grindelwald

- Harry/Antioch/Cadmus/Ignotus

- Harry/Herpo the Foul

*** Why not Dumbledore gets punished for his crimes and shares a cell with Grindelwald? Then they can do butt-stuff like I like to say they did back in 1899.

Seriously though, Harry would be an even luckier dude!

** What's the point of this story? Harems and "light side" and pretty much every cliche that has been beaten to death for the last 15 years. You should really come up with a plot before worrying about things like pairing.

** Too many characters for a coherent story. Most romances are already "full" when they focus on two characters getting together - you have more than a dozen relationships planned, not counting the ones inside the planned harem. If you focus sufficient attention on each relationship, then the story devolves into dozens of character interactions strung along in a not even loosely related manner, where the reader has forgotten what happened in a scene long before the story returns to that pairing. And if you shorten those relationship development scenes, they become mere background noise - and only clutter up the story if they still involve the main character.

(I could imagine a, very cracky, story, focused on say Ron and Hermione growing closer while in the background, Harry is trying to gather a harem - emphasis on "trying" - and his antics serve as comedy relief. So, they see him sulking after Tonks flat-out laughed into his face when he proposed - she's a grown woman and he's a little boy with all the maturity of a teenage emo - and try to cheer him up without laughing at his plans for a harem.)

** Well first of all I'll say that I'm not against harem like some people here. Seriously, the author wants to write a harem and what you say won't change that, so why bother giving a long list telling him why harem won't work then going on about write what you want.

However, I have to concede that seven is simply too many for a decent fic. If you want to play with magical number, three is a sensible choice. Still hard, but more likely to be pulled off than seven. Check out linkffn(Harry Potter and the Price of Being Noble). All three girl still turned out to be rather cardboard in the end, but eh, it's better than dozens of shitty harem fics out there.

Secondly, this one I also have to concede, this idea of yours is far from new. Not this exact line up, but linkffn(The Harem War by Vance McGill) is the story to go by for reference if you're planning to write this.

Thirdly, well, you better come up with a plot, since I've yet to see anything interesting based on the few pointers above. And your story will fare better if you follow fflai's advices. In a harem, just building the internal relationship between Harry and his girls is already a lot of work. You can't also spend time to develope other ships as well without turning this into a mess. My advice? Take only three girls and render every other relationship outside of Harry's to the background.

That's it for now, I guess, since you haven't exactly given us anything to work with. No plot, no summary, just a bunch of ideas strung together.
