** All's I know is that Voldemort would be pissed if Harry was killed by someone other than him. He'd probably torture and kill Vernon for it. I hope that he would torture and kill Vernon. Then, I know this is just me being crazy, but I'd like to think Voldemort would have a Megamind moment, because without trying to kill Harry... his life has no purpose. Anyways.

**** I mean, I wouldn't have been so sure if Vernon had unsuccessfully killed him. But I am 98% sure a successful attempt should end with Harry not living.

** He'd have gotten back up a few minutes later, but was Vernon trying to kill Harry in OotP? Thought he just tried to throw him out.

*** Didn't he put his hands around his neck at one point? Harry was sitting under the window to listen to the news, and Vernon got mad.

**** Yeah, either by his neck or his collar, but he wasn't aiming to kill as Harry was outside and the neighbors were looking

***** That's true, but Vernon could go too far even without meaning to. And the question is what would happen if he did kill Harry.

** Everyone would make a ruckus of how the BWL was killed by a Muggle. Bring out Harry's abuse and cue Blood Purist propaganda with Harry as a martyr for the anti-muggle movement. The war is lost before it begins.
