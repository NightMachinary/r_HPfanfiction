In other words, a common fandom cliche is turned on its head or given a fresh twist.

For example:

- Dumbledore really is manipulative -- and he curbstomps Harry into obedience the second the little douche discovers his dastardly plan.

- Harry is not the Boy Who Lived -- but his sister is the Girl Who Lived. (This is more of a "fresh twist" than an anti-cliche.)

- Ron is a Death Eater -- for legitimate reasons, not just because the author wants Hermione to get with HP, DM, XY&Z, etc.

Stuff like that, you get the idea.

Story length doesn't matter, nor does completeness, and I have no issues with abandonment or where the fics are hosted.

My only other request is for stories that are *not* primarily romance-based.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2565609/147/Odd-Ideas][Chapter 147 of Rorschach's Blot's "Odd Thoughts"]]. Dumbledore explains to Harry why he manipulated things so neither Sirius nor Remus could take care of Harry.

** I can't recall the name of it for the life of me, but there exists a one-shot where Harry tries calling Dumbledore out on all of his "manipulations". Dumbledore is very calm and logical throughout, denying the accusations while giving examples of what would happen if any of that were true. Basically, Harry would get super wrecked at every turn.

Then, at the end, he reveals that Harry was sort of right all along and essentially activates Harry like some kind of brain-washed sleeper agent because he was fed up with him.

Here's a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8222091/26/The-random-craziness-file][a traitor!Ron oneshot]] by [[/u/darklooshkin]].

There are linkffn(Adorable Violence by Cloud Zen) and linkffn(Harry Potter and the Witch Queen by TimeLoopedPowerGamer) which flip the common fanfic dynamic that has Powerful!Gray!Harry as Hermione's protector and Hermione as Powerful!Gray!Harry's conscience: it's up to Harry to keep Powerful!Gray!Hermione from causing a lot of destruction.

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
