It just occurred to me that the boat in the cave could be a perverse parody of the Hogwarts lake, and the boats that take the new students across.

The room of hidden things reminds me a bit of young Tom Riddle's collection of trophies and keepsakes, but on a stupidly large scale.

The Gaunt Shack is already a symbol of decay related to fanatical pureblood ideals, without any further twisting needed.

Maybe I'm just thinking too much about it, but I was curious if similar thoughts had occurred to anyone else.


** Here's the deal, everything about the Horcruxes was symbolic:

- The three founders objects are each stored in locations relative to the element of that founder: locket in a lake (water), cup underground (earth), diadem high up in a castle (air). Not a coincidence.
- The ring was stored in the same place that he stole it from and right by where he killed his father and grandparents, plus in his ancestral home.
- The diary was supposed to end up in the Chamber of Secrets essentially, which opening the first time led him to his first murder /and/ the creation of that specific horcrux.
- Nagini is the embodiment of Voldemort's narcissism: the only living thing he truly cares about besides himself...is also partly himself. Plus, its sort of an altered version of what Harry is and serves as foreshadowing to the "discovery" that Harry is a horcrux.
- Harry being a horcrux is filled with symbolism, but the best irony of the whole thing is that Harry was the one person Voldemort would never stop trying to kill, and was also the only person he couldn't live without.
- Voldemort tended to place his horcruxes near places that were symbolic of his awesomeness, and were placed near where he either committed a murder, created a horcrux or gained information on the object. But this is mainly a plot device to make the trio break into the most guarded locations in magical Britain (arguably).

There is a ton of others, but these are the most important from where I stand.

*** Thanks, I don't often pay a huge amount of attention to the horcruxes in comparison to other aspects of the world, so I find your observations especially helpful!

*** As an aside I would like to further add this:

- The only founder's objects that Voldemort could not get ahold of were of Gryffindor (the Sorting Hat and the Sword). This is the House Harry is sorted into.
- The Sword and Hat each assist Harry in destroying the Basilisk (the only object Voldemort could not find) and ultimately destroying the horcruxes. More importantly, the appear in a "burst of flame" when Fawkes apparates into the Chamber of Secrets (Fawkes brings the two objects is equal to "fire" like Gryffindor's element).
- Turning Harry into a horcrux was the only way Harry was able to destroy the first horcrux and ultimately the rest of them and Voldemort himself. If he is not a parselmouth, they don't get into the chamber or even realize its a basilisk. If that doesn't happen, they don't know about the Horcruxes or even have any venom to destroy the rest with. If Harry can't see into Voldemorts mind, he can't solve most of the problems in the series (knowing what Voldemort is looking for like the Elder Wand, finding his location in the Shrieking Shack, learning of the Diadem at Hogwarts, etc.).
- Harry kills the Basilisk, the snake that Voldemort probably would have used instead of Nagini if that had been possible (it is nearly indestructible after all), only because his first horcrux goes all evil maniac on Hogwarts, and kills the diary in possibly the same place it was created in.

** I do like the boat example, never thought of that.
