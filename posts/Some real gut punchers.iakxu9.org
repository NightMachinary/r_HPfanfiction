Stories that are really good, but are real gut punchers. Maybe because of the topic at hand, the way the author portrays the characters, or other reason.

Something that focuses on survivors, guilt, PTSD, Trauma, struggling with torture, or any other similar thing.

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can be completed or not.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash, threesomes and the like. Would rather NOT have Weasley bashing.


** Linkffn(Stages of Hope) gets me every time. Particular gut punches are Luna's stories and when Harry gets one more chance to speak to Ginny

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

** linkffn(11923164) makes Snape a complex character. My favorite scenes were the last 3. The end is just well done. The emotions were raw. The characters were relatable.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

** I don't think I can link Ownership by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/copperbadge/pseuds/copperbadge/works?fandom_id=136512][Copperbadge]] directly, since it has underage characters doing adult things, but that stuff is in the plot just to punch you in the gut, not to titillate lower regions.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11622306/chapters/26132727]]) is disturbing and heartbreaking.
