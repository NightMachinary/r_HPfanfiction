Wulfric the Wizened, Archmage of Atholl, is old and wishes to retire. In the tradition of all his predecessors, to choose a worthy successor he holds a grand tournament that he invites all prodigious magicals to attend and participate in if they dare. Knowledge and prestige, power and wealth are the grand prize for the one that wins.

A party of four join together to reach the end of the tournament and split the rewards fairly; Krum the Fearsome, Cerdic the Handsome, Blodwen of Letavia, Hereward of Suthrige.

The twist? Its all a d&d game, DM'd by Teddy Lupin for his family, his god-siblings the Potters and pseudo-cousins the Granger-Weasleys
