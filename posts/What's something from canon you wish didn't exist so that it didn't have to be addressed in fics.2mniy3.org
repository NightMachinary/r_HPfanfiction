*** What's most depressing about this is that it completely misses the whole point. The purpose of the Black family's pure-blood paraphernalia (motto and "Ancient and Noble" title) is that it doesn't correspond to any reality. It's self-bestowed glorification, a sign of extreme arrogance and delusion.

By turning it into a system which pervades of all of society, a system which carries genuine political power and respect, these authors are basically buying into the Black family's delusions.

** The ability of House Elves to completely bypass all magical protections. It's rather OP, and the only reason it doesn't ruin everything is the inability of wizards to realise that they could use it.

Aurors as police. When Aurors were introduced in GoF they were awesome. The elite. You had the impression from Mad Eye Moody that they were a rag-tag band of powerful wizards whose exclusive job it was to hunt down dark wizards. Bits of OotP partially reinforced this, with McGonagall mentioning that most years the Aurors don't take on anyone new. They're so selective that even being the best in your year isn't enough - several years can go by before they find someone up to their standards. You also had Kingsley's map where he was tracking Sirius Black, hinting that he worked alone. Stealth and concealment was mentioned as part of their training.

All this created this image of a rather unstandardised force. You could picture each Auror working alone and undercover, almost like a kind of magical James Bond, each one with their own style. They were dark wizard hunters, not bureaucrats. They weren't interested in the law, they were barely within the law themselves, almost like Ministry-authorised vigilantes.

Aaand then it was all ruined. Aurors almost became a joke. They were involved in all kinds of law enforcement, not just hunting dark wizards, including bodyguard services. They were defeated time and time again in almost embarrassingly easy ways. Basically, like the rest of the Ministry, they were corrupt and incompetent.

** Legilimency and Occumency seem too much like cheating. I mean, so does magic in general, but still. It's also treated as common knowledge in fanfiction, rather than something very obscure. That alone ranks up there with Neville knowing what Horcruxes are, for example.

I also think Veritaserum is a bit overused in fics. It was an effective plot device in the books, but it's pretty clear that it's a highly restricted substance. It's also implied that there are weaker truth potions in existence; I'd like to read something in which the truth gets out from an unsuspecting person on a weak truth potion, rather than Veritaserum or Legilimency, which are just arcane overkill.

Weak truth potions scare me a lot more than the strong stuff, honestly. Stuff that anyone who passed their OWLs could brew... Even with a distinctive taste and smell, not everyone would be accustomed to screening everything they consume for it, and it could even be incorporated into a recipe so as to make it less noticeable. If weak love potions are legal and freely sold in Diagon Alley, it doesn't take Amortentia to completely ruin someone's life. There's too much attention being paid to the big guns like the Cruciatus. The real destructive power is in the little things like the Full Body-Bind, Forgetfulness Potion, Disarming, Confunding, subtle Transfiguration, etc. etc. Voldemort is just a show-off. I wouldn't doubt for a moment that he used mostly legal means of gaining power in the beginning.

  "*Asp*" is the modern [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglicisation][Anglicisation]] of the word "/aspis/," which in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_history][antiquity]] referred to any one of several [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venomous_snake][venomous snake]] species found in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile_delta][Nile]] region. [/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed][citation needed]]/] It is believed that the /aspis/ referred to in Egyptian [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythology][mythology]] is the modern [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_cobra][Egyptian cobra]].

  Throughout dynastic and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt_(Roman_province)][Roman Egypt]], the asp was a symbol of royalty. [/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed][citation needed]]/] Moreover, in both [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt][Egypt]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece][Greece]], its potent venom made it useful as a means of execution for criminals who were thought deserving of a more dignified death than that of typical executions. In some stories of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus][Perseus]], after killing Medusa, the hero used winged boots to transport her head to Mount Olympus. As he was flying over Egypt some of her blood fell to the ground, which transformed into asps and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphisbaenae][amphisbaenae]].

  According to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch][Plutarch]] (quoted by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Ussher][Ussher]]), [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra_VII_of_Egypt][Cleopatra]] tested various deadly poisons on condemned persons and concluded that the bite of the asp (from aspis - Egyptian cobra, not [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_asp][European asp]]) was the least terrible way to die; the venom brought sleepiness and heaviness without spasms of pain. The asp is perhaps most famous for its alleged role in Cleopatra's suicide (some believe it to have been a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerastes_cerastes][horned viper]]), though in 2010, German historian Christoph Schaefer and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicology][toxicologist]] Dietrich Mebs, after extensive study into the event, came to the conclusion that rather than enticing a venomous animal to bite her, Cleopatra actually used a mixture of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apiaceae][hemlock]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aconitum][wolfsbane]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium][opium]] to end her life.

Because it is poor writing. Deus ex machina is already a huge issue with magical systems in literature. Making "just so" stories with magic is not good plotting or world building.

Not all stories with magic need to be detailed essays on magical systems. Brandon Sanderson suggests (and I agree) that the explanations of magic should be equal to the problems magic solves in a story. Otherwise, readers will feel tricked or cheated. I also think that the problems requiring "special" magic that deviates from established systems should solve important problems, not simply be unexplained window dressing.

Having an eye that can see through a cloak that makes things invisible doesn't explain anything about magic. It is just a cool thing that allows fake-Moody to show off how cool and dangerous he is. In a well explored world, it would be part of a class of magic for detecting invisible people. Not in Harry Potter, though. It just is, without even an infodump from Hermione.

Sure, Harry can't sneak around him now. Not...that he wanted to, really. It is sort of pointless and doesn't add as much as something like that should.

It doesn't fit into the world, and no one references things like it later, even when it would be useful to know, even after we know the cloak can possibly be defeated in at least two ways (Dumbledore and Moody). Much better would be characters figuring out ways around that issue, explaining why they couldn't, or at least talking about it after GoF.

The Hallows are a world-class MacGuffin themselves, having no point in the last book and only existing to be something to be sought after. They solve nothing in the greater plot of the story, /as Hallows/.

But Moody's eye is even worse. It exists only to be cool and isn't explained at all. It is poor writing, solving the "Harry can't sneak around problem" without explaining anything about magic.

JKR's characters aren't really people, but are archetypes for story elements. They fit poorly into the world at best, with motivations and goals often simply declared, and sometimes entirely divorced from their environments.

Harry is the neglected orphan, but he has to be cartoonishly so to make it clear what's going on. I don't think JKR intended physical abuse to be even implied, but simply an absurd level of neglect.

The last refuge of those without good arguments.

It is a book in the vein of C. S. Lewis, and other "advanced reader" childrens literature. There is sadness and death, far in excess of anything in the children's section but the Grimm's fairy tales. The last four books are clearly YA, and the first three could be if their characters were older (usually, YA involves mid to late teens at the youngest).

Even when you suspend your disbelief to read fiction there has to be some root in reality or it never works.

And it has always bothered me she just so casually mentions things that would obviously affect and effect the character.

Even with archetypal character generation there should be some room for growth or change. But ignoring a characters past while mentioning it is...I just bothers me.

*** Dumbledore's a very interesting character. If you look at him through the lens of "JKR wrote a children's book series that turned a little bit more adult every book" then he makes perfect, absolute sense. How he acts, what he does, even the fact that he has to die at the end of the second-to-last book. In terms of metaphor, in terms of Harry growing up, then Dumbledore's a great character.

Through the lens of "let's take the series as a whole and analyze everything we know about canon Dumbledore's actions and motivations," he starts making a lot less sense. There are inconsistencies, or things that look too blatantly stupid for a wizard of Dumbledore's caliber to miss. So you start to fill in the blanks.

And thus, a Dumbledore with an evil, manipulative hidden agenda is born. But the problem is that, if that were actually the case, Dumbledore in canon was playing an incredibly subtle, vastly detailed long con.

And in almost every fic I've read where Dumbledore is a mustache-twirling villain, he's almost the complete opposite of that. His manipulations are clumsy and uncovered almost immediately by Harry (or Sirius or Hermione), he gets flustered and starts trying to trap Harry with arbitrary rules, he blatantly oversteps his authority, he loses his cool, he acts personally and visibly instead of through proxies - stuff that an actual master manipulator would /never/ do. He's cartoonishly evil, in other words.

Which is a shame, because robbing your story of conflict via a weak or easily beaten antagonist is one of the more egregious ways you can sabotage your own work.

Dumbledore is both a great and a terrible character because of this. JKR was, with each book after three, effectively writing fixfic explaining her own earlier characters in a YA novel context.

This is one of the reasons the books are so popular in the fanfic community. Because they have an example of it happening in canon.

Here's the thing, we're talking about Dumbledore, not the omniscient us:

If Dumbledore knew that Quirrel would betray, the chamber would open, etc. etc. this early on, which I doubt, then he was obviously prepared enough to defend against it. In that case there's no reason to leave him at the Dursleys.

If Dumbledore didn't know that would happen, then he couldn't know that all those things would happen and had no reason to think the blood wards were absolutely necessary. Why would blood wards be needed to protect Harry from a barely-wizard whose followers jumped ships?

****** Not the person you're responding to, but Lily's protection actually bothers me too. Agree with you that it's canon (obviously), but it just seems to me like a not-very-well fleshed out plot device with a significant impact on the plot.

The magic behind it is never really well-explained. It seems very, very different from almost all other forms of magic that we're aware of, since it's activated not by being intentionally cast (unlike spells or wandless magic, where intention really matters) but simply by self-sacrifice. It's unclear what the power behind it is. (What do we even call it? It's not a spell or a ward - a protection? What class of magic is it?) It's also activated upon a person's death, unlike other spells which I believe expire upon a person's death?

It also seems like an incredibly far-reaching piece of magic...how does it work? Why is it sometimes tied to blood relations, and more specifically, living in the house of blood relations (but not when Harry sacrifices himself at the Battle of Hogwarts)? Why does it expire when Harry comes of age (but the same is NOT true when Harry sacrifices himself to protect his friends at the Battle of Hogwarts)? If it happens to anyone who is killed for someone else, why don't we ever see or hear of this happening to anyone else? And I think [[/u/flagamuffin]]'s point was that the protection is based on love, so it's odd that it works to confer protection on the basis of living with someone who so clearly hates Harry.

The whole (lack of) explanation was just very dissatisfying to me. If anyone has additional detail or good fics / essays discussing this, I'd love to see them :)

** Snape's death ruins all SS/HG fic. So we create a lot of AUs or just pretend that he wasn't /really/ killed in that incident. Oftentimes we just write non-DH fic. Because Snape is too good and too interesting of a character to lose. Many of the other characters are one-dimensional and poorly developed (eg. the Weasleys, especially Ron who IN NO WAY deserves Hermione, as vindicated by JK herself; all of the other professors, especially the whole "Dumbledore is gay" announcement that was not apparent in canon; James Potter, who comes off as a total prick) ... Basically the mere fact that she's giving us backstories in Pottermore is indicative of the fact that she knows the characters and their motivations weren't clearly fleshed out over the course of the series. In my opinion Harry is a dupe for the true hero of the story, Hermione, who is responsible for most of the quick thinking that gets them out of danger. Granted she's not the Jesus figure that Harry or Neville are/could be, but Harry and Ron would be pretty fucked without her. All Ron ever did to help was be good at chess and be doggedly devoted to Harry.

** Dementors. They suck the fun out of fanfic faster than you can say Expecto Patronum.

They aren't explained well in canon (like, how they are controlled); are super-powerful instant-kill threats (in a kids book!); and Harry has a /massive/, poorly-explained superpower related to them. One that doesn't matter in the climax of any other plot in the story.

I know, I know. Dark Lord Potter folks love them. But they are cheap and poorly used. /Especially/ in the usual Azkaban Dark Powerful Godlike Harry fics.

They shouldn't have been in the story and I may just write them out of the next full-length fanfic I do. Why have a demon thing in the story at all? Zombies were almost a bridge too far just by themselves.

Why not just have those almost always missing-in-action Aurors out looking for Sirius, and filling in at every point in the plot?

--------------

Dementors don't fit the rest of the story themes and world-building very well and open up HUGE plot holes all over the place, so instead:

- Have the trauma of the lights going out on the train when it stopped combined with the doors slamming, and maybe a student getting stunned by accident, trigger Harry's memories of his parents dying. Bam. Instant character drama that isn't linked to something that's never really explained. (Also, Harry should have been orphaned at, like, four or something. One year olds don't remember that shit. But that's another post.) Even in a story with magic, not having magic involved is often stronger than shoehorning it in.

- Have creepy, rough looking witches and wizards patrolling the grounds all year. Every slightly changed dramatic point related to this, even Dumbledore warning students they'll get stunned first and questions will be asked at the DMLE in a holding cell later, works and is potentially even stronger.

- Have Aurors storming onto the pitch chasing after Sirius (a mysterious robed man) and firing spells everywhere scare Harry off his broom, losing him the game and putting him in the hospital wing. Our perfect hero has a problem, one that isn't caused by magic. He talks to the Defense professor about it and his feelings -- not his odd weakness to a magical death demon, his /actual human emotions/. Something that can't be cured by magic, or by learning a very hard spell and invoking his superpower. (Except it is, because love is his superpower /against Voldemort/, remember?) This makes both of their characters stronger, teacher and student, and would be a genuine human moment.

- Have Draco mocking Harry for his PTSD, trying to jump out to frighten him at various times with jinxes and explosions. This makes Draco even more of an ass, because it isn't death demons he's mocking Harry about, but a panic attack that lost his team a game. One that wasn't his fault, but still. It would be a hell of a thing for a teenager to deal with, and would be the kind of thing a victim of violence and loss would actually face.

- Eventually, Harry overcomes his fear of violent magical conflict, and manages to distract the Aurors as they're trying to chase down Sirius and the trio in the Time Turner scenario. Harry would overcome his fears and distract them with a barrage of spells, a huge explosion, a complicated illusion, or some such, allowing Sirius and the younger trio to escape. You know. Actual magic, not his superpower.

--------------

With this single change, instead of an odd extra-special Harry ability shoved into a few disconnected moments, you have character growth and real conflict.

And fanfics now don't have to plot around Dementors, and why they don't solve or cause everyone's problems every time.

Oh, and Azkaban can still be a horrible place. But one made clearly by humans /being horrible/. I read Roald Dahl as a kid. They can take a little realism instead of oh-so-scary yet poorly explored demons.

--------------

POST EVERYTHING EDIT, BUT BEFORE I /POSTED/ BECAUSE I CAN'T BE ARSED TO FIT IT IN EARLIER:

Just call the special witch-hunter Auror squad, full of nasty and borderline psychotic men and women wearing tattered black robes:

*/The Dementors/*.

They are known for torturing escaped prisoners before dragging them back (when they don't have kill on sight orders). And when they levitate some poor stunned fool up close to their face to /read their minds/, it's called The Kiss. Then they kill the guilty person on the spot.

Or so the story goes.

You're welcome, everyone.

You're gonna have to expand on all of this...

They're explained perfectly well in canon, both in what they are and how they're controlled. Not sure where your confusion is.

Dementors are non-beings which come into existence in places of despair and multiply as that despair increases. They are magical manifestations of depression, sucking out happy thoughts from people, leaving them only with unhappy ones. They can kiss you and remove your soul. They cannot be physically harmed or killed because they're not alive in the first place. They can be warded off by a guardian spirit which is conjured by focusing on a happy memory. The guardian spirit is not itself a happy memory, it is simply conjured with one, and dementors cannot stand its presence. The Ministry keep the dementors under control by giving them a steady supply of "food" via Azkaban.

Not sure what's the problem in any of that.

They're only instant kill threats if you don't know how to defend from them. Which is really the same as any other dangerous thing.

Harry doesn't have any superpower related to them. He simply is able to cast the patronus charm. There's no indication that Harry's Patronus is special in any way.

I think you've been watching the movies too much. In the movies the Patronus is explained as the happy memory itself, and Harry's Patronus charm does weird stuff. Remember that in the books, at the end of PoA Harry's Patronus was a regular corporeal Patronus. There's no indication that any other wizard capable of conjuring a corporeal patronus wouldn't have been able to do the same.

(Or perhaps you've been reading too much MoR, given your impression that Dementors represent death)

Edit: also, I'm not sure on what basis you're saying that they don't fit the world building. The HP world is full of ghosts, poltergeists, boggarts, vampires and werewolves. Grindylows are described as demons too, incidentally. That doesn't mean that there's some demonic realm that these creatures come from. It's just a classification.

There is no indication that most people can use it at all. Only members of the DA, Dumbledore, and /some/ of the Order ever use them. Harry's drives off "at least a hundred" Dementors, something no one other than Dumbledore ever does. None of the other teachers even attempt one at the quidditch match.

People are said to usually get a mist, and most people don't even seem to know the spell at all. Harry gets a huge, glowing stag after less than six months practicing it, and goes on to teach the DA how to cast it. Both very unusual things.

Which makes sense. If anyone could counter the guards of the supermax prison, they wouldn't be a very good prison guard. But even later, we don't see anyone else fighting dementors like this. In fact, we hardly see them at all. Strange. Almost like they weren't important in canon other than in this single storyline, then they practically disappeared from the world.

In canon:

#+begin_quote
  The Patronus is a kind of positive force, a projection of the very things that the Dementor feeds upon -- hope, happiness, the desire to survive -- but it cannot feel despair, as real humans can, so the Dementors can't hurt it. But I must warn you, Harry, that the Charm might be too advanced for you. Many qualified wizards have difficulty with it.

The Patronus taking that form was strange. Harry able to use it at all was strange. And Harry driving off hundreds of Dementors was strange. Harry was able to do it because:

  "Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth. They infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair, they drain peace, hope and happiness out of the air around them. Even Muggles feel their presence, though they can't see them. Get too near a Dementor and every good feeling, every happy memory, will be sucked out of you. If it can, the Dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself -- soulless and evil. You'll be left with nothing but the worst experiences of your life[...]"
#+end_quote

That's all we get from canon about them and their origins. They are scary, sure, but they aren't well integrated into the world. A world with things like this doesn't look like the canon Harry Potter world, and their use and containment (and they would have to be contained by wizards, as Muggles can't even see them) should be a huge deal.

That's why they are such a pain in the ass for fanfic, and why so many writers simply ignore them in their stories. Your wildly unorganized libel against me and my post aside, it is clear that they aren't used well in canon, and a lot of patching has been done by various extended fiction, including the movies, to make them useful. Because the books don't do a good job of explaining or using them.

That's why I wish they didn't exist in canon. Which is what the OP was about, remember?

Pottermore *is* canon. It's written by JKR, professionally edited, published by an official medium. I don't see on what grounds it could possibly be said not to be canon except on some kind of archaic preference given to paper. The Star Wars fandom manages to use a perfectly servicable idea of canon despite said canon being visual rather than on paper. I don't see why material hosted on the internet should be any different

In fact it is:

#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

In fact it is:

#+begin_quote
  “Well, when it works correctly, It conjures up a Patronus,” said Lupin, “which is a kind of anti-Dementor --- a guardian that acts as a shield between you and the Dementor.”
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  Most people can't do this [cast the Patronus] in canon, meaning there is a lot more to it than that.
#+end_quote

There are so many things wrong with this statement.

1. The logic of the implication is faulty. That not many people can perform the Charm says nothing about whether the Charm is enough to control the Dementors. The population at large doesn't need to know it, so long as the Ministry has a pool of wizards who do.

2. The assumption that because the Charm is difficult there has to be more to it than we're told. It's perfectly possible for most people to be incapable of the Patronus charm and yet it to consist of exactly what we're told: A) Most people can learn it, they simply never get around to it (DA learning it suggests this possibility) B) The mental performance required is what makes it hard and Harry is good at it because mental willpower is basically the one skill he has in abundance (see: imperius, priori incantatum).

#+begin_quote
  [Regarding Ministry control of Dementors by offering them prisoners to feed on] Not canon.
#+end_quote

Yes it is:

#+begin_quote
  “The rest of us sleep less soundly in our beds, Cornelius, knowing that you have put Lord Voldemort's most dangerous supporters in the care of creatures who will join him the instant he asks them!” said Dumbledore. “They will not remain loyal to you, Fudge! Voldemort can offer them much more scope for their powers and their pleasures than you can!
#+end_quote

That is: the Dementors work for the Ministry because of the Ministry offer them the possibility of using their powers, and if offered greater scope to use their powers they will take it.

Your incredulity at the explanation does not make the explanation disappear. Personally I feel no incredulity at all. I'm somewhat baffled at your confusion regarding their ability to take orders, for example. They're non-beings, yes, but they're still intelligent. Clearly from the Dementors perspective, working at Azkaban without the Ministry constantly coming after them with Patronuses is the superior option compared to running amok and constantly coming into conflict with the Ministry.

#+begin_quote
  There is no indication that most people can use it at all
#+end_quote

As stated above, there's no need for the general population to be able to combat them, because the general population will in normal circumstances never encounter one. So long as the Ministry has access to wizards who can cast the Patronus, there's nothing to be explained here.

#+begin_quote
  Regarding the difficulty of the Patronus charm
#+end_quote

Yes, the Patronus is advanced magic. I never said it wasn't. But Harry being able to cast a piece of advanced magic doesn't mean he has a superpower. What makes Harry's Patronus impressive is not what it does once conjured, but that he is able to conjure one at all at his age.

Your induction that Harry's Patronus is special because it's the only one we've seen banishing so many dementors is faulty because you're working off an inductive base of one. There's only one time in canon we've seen someone cast a patronus against that many dementors. There's no basis to call that feat beyond the normal powers of a corporeal patronus.

Hermione is impressed because Harry is casting post-OWL level magic (advanced magic!) not because Harry has done something unprecedented. You've also stretched Dumbledore's quote to ridiculous lengths: he's talking about the /form/ of Harry's Patronus, not his conjuring of one in the first place. What Dumbledore finds interesting is that James Potter's animagus form is Harry's guardian. Dumbledore is saying that Harry's Patronus took the form of a stag because of James, not that his ability to conjure a Patronus is because of James. He calls it unusual, in reference to when he first saw it during the Quidditch match, because at that time he was unaware of James Potter's animagus ability.

  Pottermore is canon.
#+end_quote

It was written after the fact. If you want to call it canon, fine. But that doesn't change how the /stories/ were written. And that's what I care about. Not the author's own behind the scenes fansplinations. Which most of your points also count as.

#+begin_quote
  Star Wars fandom manages to use a perfectly servicable idea of canon
#+end_quote

And there is currently a riot in the fandom because Disney is removing all books and properties from canon, except for the original three movies and things done after the prequels came out. Future works will pretend like anything earlier from the EU doesn't exist.

Either the context of the instruments of culture are controlled by the society in which they exist, or the creators and publishers maintain control forever.

I prefer the works to stand on their own merit, as published, at least when it comes to literary analysis. Otherwise, you open the doors to this sort of revisionism. I made clear that I was talking about the contents of the books.

Both your reasoning and your examples are, on this and other points, flawed.

--------------

I will attempt to make this brief, as you didn't add anything to the discussion but merely attempted to pull apart my arguments again. Dealing with that in depth isn't worth my time.

- Dementor attributes aren't supported by your quote. Wild fan speculation.

- The word spirit wasn't used in the next quote, only the word guardian. And not as a title, but as a descriptor, and a much weaker one. No attributes of the Patronus were included. Not support for your point.

- The majority of characters in canon do not cast the Patronus. The majority of characters /in situations in which it would be advantageous/ do not do so. Given it's communications uses, many situations are simply unbelievable if people involved knew how to use the Patronus but don't. Hell, if it is that easy, Dumbledore should use it to identify people after fake-Mad Eye. Make people cast their Patronus to identify themselves. But that doesn't happen. Because it is a really rare and hard to cast spell, that Harry /masters/ in less than six months.

- Fudge is not a reliable narrative voice. But also, what he says doesn't support what you said. He doesn't state how anything he suggests would happen with Voldemort would actually take place, or how or why Dementors don't run free anyway. If the Patronus is all that affects them /at all/, then what possible threat could the Ministry pose to them? It doesn't hold together, either canon or your fanon explanations. "Take orders" is not the same thing as control, no matter how confused that fact makes you. It is a gap in canon that doesn't make any sense when viewed logically. You can't argue from the presumption of your fanon conclusion -- that is a logical fallacy.

- Dumbledore states that Harry's ability to use the Patronus is linked to his parent's love that he has inside, specifically his dad's. That is his explanation for how Harry is able to cast it, using the form it took as part of his proof of his own reasoning as Harry had never actually seem his father's animagus form -- this is the proof of the magical part of the superpower. Your interpretation is flawed and doesn't take into account the context and content of that quote. He is not merely explaining the form, but the reason behind it existing at all.

#+begin_quote
  They don't kill people, they suck out their souls.
#+end_quote

- This is a stupid thing to claim.

#+begin_quote
  My point was that demons are part of the HP world
#+end_quote

- No, they are not. Things "called" demons are, but not the kind made popular in religious Catholic fanfic about demons. Thus, Dementors are not excused somehow in the canon world by being demonic and like other things /called/ demons, but possessing none of those attributes. Not even the stupid extended web materials support this idea.

- /Libel: a published false statement that is damaging to a person's reputation; a written defamation./ I wasn't suggesting I'd sue you, you dork, simply that you were saying things that were clearly false and intentionally misrepresenting what I was saying to such an extent that it made me appear in a bad light.

How they work in the world is. Their abilities, how they are actually controlled, and the danger they represent when most wizards never learn the spell to counter them means a lot in a well-fleshed-out world. But not in canon.

Any time someone writes a fanfic with Voldemort trying something different, the elephant in the room is "why not Dementors?" Any evil plan is better with them, and Voldemort can (apparently) bargain with or control them. So...why not always do so?

That's why I wish they didn't exist in canon.

Also, Thestrals are a big fucking problem, too. But that is another post.

  Harry has a massive, poorly-explained superpower related to them
#+end_quote

What are you on about? The Patronus is possibly the best explained spell in the entirety of Harry Potter.

#+begin_quote
  Have the trauma of the lights going out on the train when it stopped combined with the doors slamming, and maybe a student getting stunned by accident, trigger Harry's memories of his parents dying. Bam. Instant character drama that isn't linked to something that's never really explained. (Also, Harry should have been orphaned at, like, four or something. One year olds don't remember that shit. But that's another post.) Even in a story with magic, not having magic involved is often stronger than shoehorning it in.
#+end_quote

Firstly if Harry were orphaned at 4 with memories it would destroy the whole point of him not knowing about magic and the Dursleys not telling him anything about his parents. Secondly a one year old cannot consciously recall those memories but the Dementors make you relieve your worst /experiences/ so it's not unreasonable to assume they can pull the memory from Harry's deepest subconscious.

#+begin_quote
  Have creepy, rough looking witches and wizards patrolling the grounds all year. Every slightly changed dramatic point related to this, even Dumbledore warning students they'll get stunned first and questions will be asked at the DMLE in a holding cell later, works and is potentially even stronger.
#+end_quote

It's not stronger and it makes absolutely no sense. Dumbledore forced the Dementors off grounds because he didn't want them harming students, why would he allow people to stun them? People I might add who can tell the difference between a student and Sirius Black and would listen to explicit instructions not to harm one. Even Fudge wouldn't be okay with it as the Dementors attacking Harry at the end is the reason he removes them.

#+begin_quote
  Have Aurors storming onto the pitch chasing after Sirius (a mysterious robed man) and firing spells everywhere scare Harry off his broom, losing him the game and putting him in the hospital wing. Our perfect hero has a problem, one that isn't caused by magic. He talks to the Defense professor about it and his feelings -- not his odd weakness to a magical death demon, his actual human emotions. Something that can't be cured by magic, or by learning a very hard spell and invoking his superpower. (Except it is, because love is his superpower against Voldemort, remember?) This makes both of their characters stronger, teacher and student, and would be a genuine human moment.
#+end_quote

So only the Aurors are going to try and stop Sirius and are such terrible shots they manage to miss completely? Nor would Snape or Lupin or anyone help? Heck it's pretty clear Snape would chase Sirius to the ends of the earth to capture him, he's not just going to let him run away.

As [[/u/taure]] said the Dementors are beings of emotion, not death and the "superpower" as you put it is a spell of emotion. The opposite emotion to the one the Dementors produce. Also hardly a superpower when anyone can do it.

As for the genuine human moment, how long has it been since you read the book? Because the entire Lupin-Harry teaching moment was filled with them, and talks about emotions and Harry's parents.

#+begin_quote
  Have Draco mocking Harry for his PTSD, trying to jump out to frighten him at various times with jinxes and explosions. This makes Draco even more of an ass, because it isn't death demons he's mocking Harry about, but a panic attack that lost his team a game. One that wasn't his fault, but still. It would be a hell of a thing for a teenager to deal with, and would be the kind of thing a victim of violence and loss would actually face.
#+end_quote

...why though? Why would this be the thing to give Harry PTSD and not, say killing his professor in first year?

#+begin_quote
  Eventually, Harry overcomes his fear of violent magical conflict, and manages to distract the Aurors as they're trying to chase down Sirius and the trio in the Time Turner scenario. Harry would overcome his fears and distract them with a barrage of spells, a huge explosion, a complicated illusion, or some such, allowing Sirius and the younger trio to escape. You know. Actual magic, not his superpower.
#+end_quote

Again you really need to reread the actual books, by the end of the series near everyone and there mother can cast the Patronus. I'm also confused as to why you don't classify it as real magic? What's the difference between it and an illusion.

#+begin_quote
  And fanfics now don't have to plot around Dementors, and why they don't solve or cause everyone's problems every time.
#+end_quote

What fanfics have you been reading? With the exception of Azkaban one's they're never mentioned outside of a final battle type situation...

#+begin_quote
  They are known for torturing escaped prisoners before dragging them back (when they don't have kill on sight orders). And when they levitate some poor stunned fool up close to their face to read their minds, it's called The Kiss. Then they kill the guilty person on the spot.
#+end_quote

This I like. Although it would work better in a non-magical fic than a normal one imo.

--------------

I don't understand why you hate Dementors, frankly you seem to have missed the entire point of them. They're one of the most powerful metaphors for Depression that i've ever seen in a novel and certainly in a kids book. Can you imagine telling a kid "Oh I have depression" and being able to describe it as feeling like a Dementor being around all the time? It fits perfectly which is why they're such a wonderful creation if nothing else.

Also can you explain why you seen so convinced Harry Potter would be better with a minimal amount of magic? It kinda defeats the purpose of a kids book about wizard school...

I agree with whoever else said it, you seem to have read MoR way to often.

  The Patronus is possibly the best explained spell in the entirety of Harry Potter.
#+end_quote

It is a uniquely janky spell, with no wand motions and an odd requirement that for some reason most wizards can't manage. It gains a communications use later on, and it's form can suddenly change. Emotions are critical here, and nowhere else (except for maybe the Unforgivables?) Reasons for any of this are not given. Hardly well explained.

In fact, everything we learn about it makes it seem less well thought out than the levitation charm, which works exactly the way people expect it to, affects real-world objects in a consistent way, and is taught in a normal class to everyone.

But it is Harry's use of it that is most unusual. No one else uses it like he does. Dumbledore says it worked like that because his dad was still inside him, because those we love never truly leave us. It is a superpower, meant to foreshadow his love being what defeats Voldemort.

A lot of people say JKR didn't introduce elements of the end of the story in earlier books. That's clearly false, and this is one of the best examples of that. The last book still sucked, but the earlier reveal of love being Harry's power that "Voldemort knew not" was based in a lot of hints. This one was just really over the top.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Firstly if Harry were orphaned at 4 with memories it would destroy the whole point of him not knowing about magic and the Dursleys not telling him anything about his parents.

That isn't canon and isn't how memories work. A one year old literally can't remember things like older children can. Physically /can not/. JKR almost gets it right, with her sound-only effects in the books. I hear it is more over the top in the movies. More on this idiocy later.

Yet Harry's unusual ability to remember these things is never, ever brought up. My fanon fixes this, and also doesn't involve him being left on a doorstep in a basket or possibly being locked in a cupboard as an infant. Which is why him being four would make more sense, and also give him /vague/ memories of his parents to recall in dreams and magical visions. Much stronger story elements.

Many fanfic do this anyway, giving Harry involved visions and even having him give James and Co. cute nicknames, which is nonsense. One year olds simply aren't this mentally advanced. They can barely remember objects like their toys, and are only starting to have any symbolic reasoning or memory. Having Harry only vaguely remember his parents is a lot better than a mirror and an impossible, monster-induced magical terror memory from a character building standpoint.

You are trolling me. Shit. Well, might as well do this quick.

Dumbledore /allowed/ Dementors around the school, because he politically had no choice. He kept them out of the school grounds (something we are directly told "angers" the Dementors, so much for them being unintelligent) by saying "no" to Fudge, not by any magical means (which apparently don't exist in canon). So no, he didn't allow anything to happen in canon, and wouldn't in my fanon idea.

I'm not sure what you're saying about stunning. I think you are confused and not reading what I wrote correctly. I only said anything about accidentally stunning a student on the train, which has nothing to do with the confused statement you made. Therefore, no confusion with Sirius Black exists for anyone in my story idea.

This is really strange.

Right. Since you're clearly fucking with me, I'm abandoning civility.

Read what I wrote. I didn't say anything about people standing around watching. This is a pathetic argument, formed in your own /demented/ mind. Snape /might/ act against a man he thought was Sirius Black. If he recognized him, or even saw him. Dementors were doing exactly this in canon, chasing Sirius' dog form. No one noticed the dog or even the Dementors until the last minute.

Then, only Dumbledore casts a patronus, or is said to have done anything to help. Your bizarre attempts to frame my post in the worst possible light is bordering on harassment at this point.

More non-canon assumptions and nonsense. They kill people, easily and without leaving a mark. They represent despair, madness, and death.

Harry does something no one else in canon does, drive away "at least a hundred" Dementors with a single spell. Dumbledore is surprised by the form his Patronus takes, calling it "most unusual". And Harry's superpower is the emotion of love.

So no, not anyone can do what Harry did. It isn't even clear if Dumbledore could have. He certainly didn't, even though it took place on Hogwarts grounds. You'd think he'd have noticed hundreds of Dementors swarming yet again. But he doesn't.

--------------

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

It was a series of backstory dumps. It talks about emotions, but it doesn't show people having them very well. It is a mechanism to tell Harry's parents' story.

Harry's issues aren't well discussed, and though it clearly affects Lupin hearing about his friend's death and seeing Harry suffer practicing against the fake-Dementor, it isn't something that develops Harry as a character. He knows he might have issues with wanting to hear his parents, but he doesn't change from his experiences, he only gains an arbitrary and symbolic skill.

It is his current issues, his weakness to the Dementor presence, that is focused on. Not how Harry is an orphan and how he feels about that, how Harry hates his current living situation, nor why Lupin has been absent for twelve years. Harry feels angry and frustrated, he tries harder, he can't seem to do it. Lupin is supportive, he drops the "friends with parents" thing, then never brings it up again to expand on that with real, emotional stories or questions about who Harry is and what his life is like. Harry experiences the issues, but he doesn't deal with them (and that isn't mentioned) and no one even attempts to talk to him about it. Which is not a very realistic mentor and student relationship. Which is why my fanon version is better, for that and the reasons I've already stated.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  ...why though? Why would this be the thing to give Harry PTSD and not, say killing his professor in first year?
#+end_quote

You know nothing about psychology and are making absurd arguments. Emotional reactions to childhood trauma is a real thing, even as young as a year old. Increased sensitivity to loud noises and frightening, violent actions and death is a real thing. Adding in magic and a /cursed head wound/ makes this even more reasonable, when usually early trauma has much less effect on development. It also fits into the magical world much better than magically recovered memories. Your logic is lacking and your taste is questionable.

An accidental, magical, self-defense death that Harry never sees (remember, he can't see Thestrals until after Cedric dies) is clearly a different matter. He was attacked, which would if anything only increase his trauma about that. He didn't kill someone intentionally. But none of that matters, because /everything I said/ about that was my fanon ideas. In my fanon story, that confrontation would have /only made things worse/. So comparing it to canon like that to disprove something (?) doesn't make any sense. Which I've come to expect from you at this point.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Again you really need to reread the actual books, by the end of the series near everyone and there mother can cast the Patronus. I'm also confused as to why you don't classify it as real magic?
#+end_quote

No, just /some/ of the Order, made up of people Dumbledore personally trained. Like, a professional dark wizard hunter, Tonks, the head of a department at the Ministry of /Magic/, Arthur Weasley, and people Harry personally trained. Making his ability to teach it to them part of his love/Patronus superpower.

This claim that "near everyone" could cast it is funny, because most of the Patronus use is movie "canon", something I'm being accused of paying too much attention to. Only a few people could get "true" forms in the DA in the book, and only some of the adults could cast it. Hardly easy, as even older students weren't doing well with it.

At OWLS, the examiners had heard about it but were still surprised Harry could do it, which /strongly/ suggests that those in his year having last names starting with earlier than "P" hadn't managed (or maybe hadn't tried) to cast it yet. It is clearly not common, and Harry is unusually skilled with it to the point that he can teach it to other people better than Lupin could.

Describe the motions and words to turn a hedgehog into a pin cushion. Oh wait you can't. Cause it's not in the books. The Patronus on the other hand is laid out perfectly.

#+begin_quote
  But it is Harry's use of it that is most unusual. No one else uses it like he does.
#+end_quote

Yes they do, the only thing unique about him is that he was young when he cast it. Which arguably isn't surprising as there is no reason for anyone outside the Aurors to learn to cast it.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore says it worked like that because his dad was still inside him, because those we love never truly leave us.

#+end_quote

You can't call Harry being particularly good at a spell a superpower it's ridiculous in a world of magic. As for the love your entire argument for that is based off a quote you mistakenly attributed to someone else.

#+begin_quote
  Harry wouldn't remember any of that. Most people don't remember being four, and they aren't traumatized.
#+end_quote

No actually memories normally form at 3 and it is well believed in Psychiatric fields that our experiences prior to that affect our lives. So Harry would absolutely remember it. Heck I remember my first day of school and that was when I was 4.

#+begin_quote

This is what you said "Dumbledore warning students they'll get stunned first and questions will be asked at the DMLE in a holding cell later"

That wouldn't happen. Ive already made my point why.

#+begin_quote
  Dementors were doing exactly this in canon, chasing Sirius' dog form
#+end_quote

Read the books rather than fanfiction once in a while. They were attracted to the Quidditch Pitches by the amount of emotions being expressed, not Sirius.

#+begin_quote
  Emotional reactions to childhood trauma is a real thing, even as young as a year old. Increased sensitivity to loud noises and frightening, violent actions and death is a real thing. Adding in magic and a cursed head wound makes this even more reasonable, when usually early trauma has much less effect on development.
#+end_quote

I'm absolutely loving the contradiction between this and "Harry won't remember anything as a four year old"

#+end_quote

Seriously? What is wrong with you?

--------------

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    And fanfics now don't have to plot around Dementors, and why they don't solve or cause everyone's problems every time.
  #+end_quote

  What fanfics have you been reading? With the exception of Azkaban one's they're never mentioned outside of a final battle type situation...
#+end_quote

I'll use small words.

Plot. Around. Means. Try. Not. To. Mention.

Also, you're wrong. Plenty of fanfics use them from everything from removing Harry's Horcrux to forming the core of Voldemort (or someone else's) army during various conflicts. Harry's cousin gets attacked and Hermione has been attacked with them, as well as Harry in many other situations.

But /most/ of the time, they are avoided. Because they are terrible. They're not "never mentioned". More senseless hyperbole.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  I don't understand why you hate Dementors, frankly you seem to have missed the entire point of them. They're one of the most powerful metaphors for Depression that i've ever seen in a novel and certainly in a kids book. Can you imagine telling a kid "Oh I have depression" and being able to describe it as feeling like a Dementor being around all the time? It fits perfectly which is why they're such a wonderful creation if nothing else.
#+end_quote

Why is this seen as hate for you? Sure, I'm directly addressing the things you are saying are good writing. That doesn't make my points hate, however. This is an extremely irrational attitude.

Externalized depression is weaker than internalized depression, especially when the externalized depression (and death) isn't well addressed in how it relates to the wider world.

Magical distress that everyone can feel is a weaker storytelling mechanism than normal distress that only a little kid can feel, especially when no one else is dealing with it the same way that kid is.

By making these things external and impersonal, it removes it from the common context. This is fine, if you then make the story relatable again by making people deal with the situation like human beings.

In Harry Potter, people say how bad things are -- people in town complain about the constant patrols and searches for example -- but you don't see the suffering as a thing that affect people's personal development. It just "scares off customers". Hardcore, bar lady.

People never talk about how the experience is affecting them, or relate it to their pasts. Except for Harry, and that is again a magical thing that no one else can relate to. We don't learn how being around Dementors all year affects people. We learn about chocolate, but not why it helps. We have three scenes with Harry and Lupin learning the Patronus, but we don't have a teacher dealing with a student's emotional issues.

If anything, he's making them worse. And we don't see /that/ addressed, either. This is practically a Dead Poets Society moment, and it is just passed by. Remus leaves because he forgot to take his potion and got ratted out by Snape, not because he encouraged a student to learn a powerful magic spell used only (at that point) against dangerous magical creatures. If Fudge had found that out, he could have blamed Lupin for endangering the boy by putting ideas of fighting evil into his head. That would have been real world consequences to those actions.

Instead, we get Harry doing powerful magic to show he's a powerful wizard. It requires strong emotions, showing Harry has strong emotions. It requires love, which Harry has with him, as Dumbledore says, because those we love never truly leave us.

Not because Harry is a person with problems who is still worthy of love and capable of loving. Not because Harry loves his friends or his teachers. But because of his magic inner dad. Which is why it takes the shape of his dad's animal form. Because his dad is still with him, in a way expressed directly by magic.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Also can you explain why you seen so convinced Harry Potter would be better with a minimal amount of magic? It kinda defeats the purpose of a kids book about wizard school...
#+end_quote

Not really. Because this is all in your head. I'm not sure what fight you're fighting, but it isn't against the things I've /actually said/. I think /well explained/ magical demons who kill you by sucking out all of your happy thoughts and then your soul would be totally wicked.

That's not what Dementors are. They are a strong symbol representing death and despair, with little to no grounding in the world that JKR built. They are pulled out twice more, but they are so uninteresting that she even reuses the spell introduced /specifically to counter them/ as a communications spell. Something you'd think Lupin or Dumbledore would have mentioned the /second/ someone they might need to communicate to on a moment's notice mastered the spell.

It doesn't fit together, and that makes it bad. It annoys me that people can't see this, but I certainly don't hate them or Dementors. I was answering the original question of "what's something from canon you wish didn't exist". Sniping at someone who answers with a creative and thoughtful post is brutish and short sighted.

Everything you said initially that I could prove wrong, I did. I wrote line by line why. I'll do it again.

The opinions you stated were odd fan interpretations that I clearly don't agree with, and I showed why. Again, with line by line citations. Nothing you've said has shown anything /I've/ said to be factually incorrect.

It is only your /opinions/ on things like what a Dementor /represents/, what makes for a /well-described/ spell, whether not having a soul any longer kills you (what the fuck), or whether Fudge having Barty Crouch Jr. Kissed by Dementors was a death sentence (obviously it was) that I can't disprove. Because that's not how opinions work.

Even then, it is a sick, egotistical thing to ask for opinions then rudely shoot down other people like this when they give theirs. Especially disgusting is how poorly you've done it, by stating opinions as facts and misstating actual facts that are easy to check, such as:

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Sirius said those we love never truly leave us, Dumbledore didn't mention anything of the sort. How long has it been since you read the books?
#+end_quote

Wow, look here /in the book I've read/:

#+begin_quote
  ‘An easy mistake to make,' *said Dumbledore* softly. ‘I expect you're tired of hearing it, but you do look extraordinarily like James. Except for your eyes ... you have your mother's eyes.'

  Harry shook his head.

  ‘It was stupid, thinking it was him,' he muttered. ‘I mean, I knew he was dead.'

  ‘*You think the dead we have loved ever truly leave us?* You think that we don't recall them more clearly than ever in times of great trouble? Your father is alive in you, Harry, and shows himself most plainly when you have need of him. How else could you produce that particular Patronus? Prongs rode again last night.'

  It took a moment for Harry to realise *what Dumbledore had said*.
#+end_quote

This is after Sirius is gone and even Lupin has left. That's just Dumbledore and Harry, alone. What kind of a douchebag would insult someone for not reading the books while getting facts like this so wrong?

--------------

Then we have this:

#+begin_quote
  This is what you said "Dumbledore warning students they'll get stunned first and questions will be asked at the DMLE in a holding cell later"

  That wouldn't happen. Ive already made my point why.
#+end_quote

Right, because Dumbledore would never say something like:

#+begin_quote
  ‘They are stationed at every entrance to the grounds,' Dumbledore continued, ‘and while they are with us, I must make it plain that nobody is to leave school without permission. Dementors are not to be fooled by tricks or disguises -- or even Invisibility Cloaks,' he added blandly, and Harry and Ron glanced at each other. ‘*It is not in the nature of a Dementor to understand pleading or excuses. I therefore warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you.* I look to the Prefects, and our new Head Boy and Girl, to make sure that no student runs foul of the Dementors.'
#+end_quote

That's it. If you don't want to be harmed, don't go near them at the edge of the school.

Exactly the same situation I suggested, except with "demons" that suck out people's souls -- though this doesn't kill them, of course, by your reasoning.

How is that possibly worse or more unlikely than a kid getting stunned and pulled in for questioning, in a world with polyjuice and magical disguises? This is an example of a factual misstatement to make your confused /opinion/ sound like gospel. Dirty debating at best.

Scummy trolling, in my opinion.

#+begin_quote
  That's it. If you don't want to be harmed, don't go near them at the edge of the school.

You know I made it clear in my first reply to you that the reason for those aurors not working is not Dumbledore but Fudge and the general opposition to harming children. If you remember (i'm betting you don't though seeing as you seem to have missed a lot from PoA) the reason that the Dementors were removed was because /Fudge/ removed them because he was shocked that they had attacked a child. So there is no way he would assign shady aurors to stun and interrogate children, particularly as they were not the reason for Dementors being put there in the first place.

I'd hope what JKR wrote was deliberate. Yet, that doesn't make your absolute statement earlier any less completely wrong, as the quote from the book shows. Let's read that one once again:

  ‘*You think the dead we have loved ever truly leave us?* You think that we don't recall them more clearly than ever in times of great trouble? Your father is alive in you, Harry, and shows himself most plainly when you have need of him. How else could you produce that particular Patronus? Prongs rode again last night.'

  It took a moment for Harry to realise what *Dumbledore* had said.
#+end_quote

That was where you hung your argument against my Patronus superpower theory. So...that didn't work out, did it?

Thus what I said /about/ that line stands, showing Dumbledore believed what I was saying about Harry's ability to love being a power Voldemort didn't know and Harry's greatest strength. His superpower, in other words. This was based in part on his parents' love /literally/ being with Harry, and /specifically/ his dad's love powering his Patronus.

This complements his mother's love powering his defense in book one, obviously, though unlike that Harry had to actively invoke the Patronus. Making it, like the anti-Voldemort skin which no one else has, a superpower -- one allowing a thirteen-year-old to (eventually, after less than six months practice) effortlessly cast a complicated spell even in a crisis situation. Something Lupin said was especially difficult.

Dumbledore's explanation is clear to anyone who /reads the books/.

So, what was what you wrote? Moving the goalposts? Complete cognitive failure? Trolling?

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Oh no wait...because Remus said this in Prisoner *"You can exist without your soul, you know, as long as your brain and heart are still working.*
#+end_quote

You interpretation of this is wildly factually incorrect. So much so that I doubt it is an argument honestly presented.

That isn't how mind-body duality works, which is what JKR uses in this story. People in these stories /are/ souls. Even Dudley has one. One's body is simply a vessel for the souls in this story world, as we see when Harry passes on (at least a little) and then comes back.

In this scene, Lupin is talking casually to a thirteen-year-old, gives no reasons for his statement, then seemingly contradicts himself literally in the same paragraph -- at least with his statement interpreted as you do.

#+begin_quote
  But you'll have no sense of self anymore, no memory, no...anything. There's no chance at all of recovery. You'll just --- exist. As an empty shell. *And your soul is gone forever*... lost.
#+end_quote

It isn't even shown to be a magical thing, the soul, as Muggles can be killed this way as well. Muggles have souls. JKR is simply differentiating between physical destruction of the brain and body and the removal of their soul -- presumably, given Dumbledore's feelings on the matter, to an afterlife. The soul is "lost", not destroyed after all -- in every major philosophy and in a medical sense, this is death. Brain death, leaving only autonomic responses. A transition to the afterlife when the soul leaves the body.

In a rational view of the subject, all a person is is a sense of self and memory, and if that is gone then they are dead even if their body still breathes automatically. From a religious and dualistic standpoint, it is even more clear-cut. You are your soul, and if you move on to the afterlife, you're dead.

This is in a world where someone who dies passes on to another adventure, and we are shown the first step of this process. If the soul leaves, it goes on somewhere else along with a sense of self.

In the case of "not-death" by Dementor, are there now /somehow/ two people, one a body without a sense of self, one a soul off on a new adventure? That clearly isn't what JKR meant. She's just having Lupin say your body isn't destroyed or damaged by a Dementor attack, meaning there is nothing to heal or fix. It is only your soul that is affected. It is a fate /worse/ than death, because it includes the death of the self in this plain of existence while leaving behind a breathing body for people to be creeped-out over.

You ignorance of, or inability to understand this Philosophy 101 topic does not make you correct. It certainly doesn't make me wrong.

Dementors kill people because they remove their soul from their body, destroying their sense of self -- as that quote shows. Which is why they are used to execute criminals, like (attempted) with Sirius Black and (successfully) with Barty Crouch Jr.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  You know I made it clear in my first reply to you that the reason for those aurors not working is not Dumbledore but Fudge and the general opposition to harming children.
#+end_quote

Harry was carried to the hospital wing because he was almost killed by Dementors. This is when Fudge panicked, when teachers and students knew that Harry had almost been killed by having his soul sucked out of his body "accidentally", "not-killing" him.

If I misunderstood your earlier statement, I apologize. I don't think I did, as that was the argument I honestly made. But my point still stands, as you haven't actually refuted it with either facts or reasoned logical statements.

Harry had fainted in front of hundreds of people earlier in the year and almost fell to his death. That was public, and much less severe than some cops throwing a teen in a holding cell. Something that happens /every day in every major city in the world/.

But Fudge didn't budge in canon, which even rhymes, after the fall at the game because it wasn't that bad to him. It wasn't "his fault" and was easily explained away. That didn't move Fudge, the same as Harry's publically known reaction on the train. Both times, Harry faints.

An experience no worse than a stunner would be. At least a sunner wouldn't have the attached horror and pain. Which is why I'm saying someone like Fudge in canon would authorize that level of use of force without a second thought. As police are authorized to do around the world, and worse. And when it happens by accident, /twice/, Fudge doesn't care. Because it isn't a big deal to him, even though it happens to Harry Potter.

Fudge doesn't even bring it up when Harry and Co. overhear him later. Dumbledore's anger kept the Dementors out again, which was something Fudge disagrees with. He wants them to search Hogwarts grounds and the castle. Because, to Fudge, they're under control, even if they scare the willies out of people. Even though he had to know Harry would faint again, as he did two previous times.

In my fanon expansion, Dumbledore would have just as much say about a crack team of Aurors guarding the entrances, i.e. none, and Fudge would have no problem with his people /maybe/ stunning kids out of bounds and scaring them some. That's what Dumbledore would warn students of, the same way he did with Dementors -- which also weren't supposed to hurt people.

That wouldn't be the Fudge's point in stationing them. It would be to catch Sirius Black, known murder. This is not something easily confused from my earlier post. I have no idea where you got this.

In Fudge's mind, in my story idea, it wouldn't be likely, and even if it did happen it wouldn't be his fault. No one would get hurt. They shouldn't be wandering around with Black on the loose anyway. So it would all be justified, that sort of minor inconvenience, so long as the dangerous killer Sirius Black was caught.

Your fixation on perceived flaws in my /opinion/ on this point simply doesn't hold water, nor do you seem to have the ability to articulate a strong point in direct opposition. Yet you keep misframing my position as somehow untenable and ludacris, disconnected from canon (which apparently I still haven't read very well, even after I destroyed that claim elsewhere), and completely outside of what anyone would see the canon characters doing.

So odd.

--------------

You are either a troll, or so unwilling or incapable of presenting reasoned written argument that I've massively overestimated the complexity of the motivations behind your responses. But given your complaints about the length of my arguments, strange personal obsession with my reading skills and habits (which I've put to hilarious rout), and the scope of reasoning presented, perhaps I have indeed made a grave mistake.

If that is the case, I sincerely apologize. Whether this friction was in fact caused by specific language capabilities or other reasons, I never meant to mock actual honest best efforts in a debate on such a trivial subject. Strong debate is simply something I enjoy. But it's not fun if I'm not dealing with a troll or a lazy and sloppy poster, and what I'm perceiving as gross disrespect in addition to ignorance actually has other origins.

There isn't much point in removing Dementors from a magical story, but I do appreciate the arguments you've given, even if I don't completely agree. It's a very interesting thought that I hadn't encountered before, so I upvoted.

What a useful post. Thank you so much for your valuable contribution to the conversation. Never saw the movies myself, though. That kind of makes you sound extra foolish, doesn't it?

Still, I'm glad this is here for everyone to see on the internet for all time. Aren't you, [[/u/GrubbyGeoff]]?

**** They would make for an interesting AU/dimension travel exploration tho. Canon world characters winding up in a world where the Weasleys were wiped out in the first war with Voldemort. Bringing Ron for such an an adventure might be awkward to explain to the natives tho... Which might make it even more amusing to have Ron be the traveler. Or George, who could be on the hunt for a George-less Fred to drag home.

**** Mostly because it's "one of the things that happened," so most stories tend to have to deal with it, or come up with reasons why it didn't happen.

Another one is the Triwizard tournament. I like the tournament, but the very fact that it's a giant event that happens without any influence from Harry means that it tends to happen a LOT in stories.

****** Yeah! That's what I mean. I have nothing against first years fighting a troll, or Harry needing to rescue an egg from merpeople. It's just that, it's almost like an obligatory event that has to happen, and is rarely changed much.

******* The thing about Stations of the Canon, though, is that if it wasn't the troll attack it would have been something else. You're basically saying "I wish the books didn't have memorable scenes." It does suck that canon rehash is as large a percentage of fanfiction as it is, but that would be the case even if the troll scene, specifically, was something else entirely.

******* I don't mind it happening, I just hate it having to be written out, invariably poorer than JK's version, with little to no changes.

But really the tasks should be summed up in about a paragraph in any fic that doesn't substantially change them.

*** But the obvious defense "STOP! Wouldn't it be better to keep us in the Great Hall UNTIL the Troll is taken care of? The Slytherins have to go deep in the dungeon where apparently the troll is! Are you interested in condemning them to danger then?!" is SO fun!

Really... Dumbledore was an IDIOT in that scene. My story I am currently working on is going to have the above during this scene.
