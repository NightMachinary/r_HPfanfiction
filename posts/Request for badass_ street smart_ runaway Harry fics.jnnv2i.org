I recently read "Behind Blue Eyes" by Elmembrila and I absolutely loved it! Especially Kittys and Harrys Developement, as well as the exploration and growth of their dynamic, relationship and "lifestyle" (for the lack of a better word).

Now, I'm searching for similar fics.

Please do not recommend any Harry/Harem or Slash fics


** I haven't read Behind Blue Eyes so don't know how it compares, but The Venom Peddler has a badass Harry you might like. Then there is also the movie, [[https://harrypotterwithguns.com]] ;-).

*** “Behind Blue Eyes by elmembrila” linkffn(2095661) is one of those stories, which are just completely original. Really good Harry/Muggle-girl, but again completely different from what you expect. Very highly recommended.

  It's the summer after the Department of Mysteries and Harry Potter's about to do something drastic, something nobody expects, and he may not be alone. Following the lives of Harry and the Order as they battle against each other.

***** If you meant similarly street-level Harry, nothing so good. If you mean Muggle-girlfriend of Harry, then “Ten More Minutes by Litfreak89” linkffn(9566537) and “Grow Young with Me by Taliesin19” linkao3(16405130) are the classics in the area. But “Behind Blue Eyes” (and of course you should listen to [[https://youtu.be/dMrImMedYRo][the The Who's song]] while reading it) is really exceptionally good.

  What if Harry had waited ten more minutes and said goodbye to the waitress in HP/HBP? Prequel, "What We Had," is now up on my page!
