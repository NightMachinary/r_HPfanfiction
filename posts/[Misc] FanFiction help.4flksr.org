Hello!

So a while ago I responded to a discussion that was going on on this subreddit about writers block/if I should post my fanfictions online.

A few individuals did reply to my comment and suggested that I submit my writings to fanfiction.net since a good starting place and heavily used by people all over. I've enjoyed it so far, and find everything relatively straight forward when it comes to uploading/updating my story.

I was more curious about the "traffic graph," that the website offers. You can see how many people view your story chapter by chapter which is awesome, but at the same time super discouraging for me...I've had roughly 150 people "View" my story but significantly less "visit" my story (especially as the chapters go on). Now, I'm not complaining that people don't like my story. I've written this story for me, and the fact that I have anyone showing interest in it is amazing. I just wanted to know if its common to have 150+ people view your fanfiction but for only 1 or 2 people follow it.

I don't know, maybe I'm a much crappier writer than what I thought haha but just wanted ask around and see if it was common to have this amount of traffic with so few results.

Thanks!


** Don't worry, very common, especially with new authors. Also, certain types of story just won't receive as much traffic as others. As for the favourite's thing, you're actually doing pretty well with that ratio :)

In my opinion, don't even look at any of the stats. Focus on your writing and feedback.

****** Ok, I'll make points as I go... :)

-So firstly, in response to your concerns regarding traffic and favourites, fics abut OCs or minor characters /always/ receive less attention than fics focused on Harry & co. That doesn't mean it's bad, it's just an issue of supply and demand, so don't be disheartened.

-Would a first year really fall asleep on the train to Hogwarts? You'd think they'd be too excited or busy making friends. Especially a Muggleborn.

-There's a few issues with grammar. When the older girl is calling her "first year", she's using it as a name. When writing dialogue, if a character is calling another by their name directly, there's usually a comma. So it would be "Wake up, first year!" or "I don't care, first year, just get off."

-I realise the older girl is a Slytherin and is supposed to be unpleasant but she's so rude here that it feels unnatural. Horrible people are often more subtle in their nastiness.

-Also in regards to grammar, think of the dialogue as part of the sentence. If there's a "he said/she said" after the dialogue, you should use a comma before the closing speech mark, not a full stop. If there isn't, and there's a start of a new sentence, you should use a full stop/period. If there's another type of punctuation, like an exclamation, question mark or dash, you do not need a comma or full stop/period as well. I probably haven't explained it very well, but [[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/words/grammar-and-usage-american][this]] is a good website to brush up on grammar, and, if you can, /find a beta/ to proofread your work.

-You do a good job of writing Hagrid's dialect, but his vocab doesn't sit quite right. Hagrid uses very informal language, so things like "none the less" and "follow me please" sound a little off - they'd be better suited to Professor McGonagall. How about "anyways" and "this way!" instead?

-You have a really nice balance of description and dialogue, well done, that's very unusual in first-time writers :)

-I love the name Gertrude, it feels very Harry Potter.

-You have your/you're mixed up here. It's "your name" not "you are name" :)

-Tread carefully with the tragic background. I like that you've introduced it carefully rather than an info dump, but you still have to be careful that you don't cross into Mary-Sue territory.

-I would love it if northern Scotland had warm evenings and nights in September, but it just doesn't happen. Sorry!

-I'm glad that your OC has flaws and she's clearly not very trusting or socially apt, but remember that the reader has to like her enough to keep coming back. What is there that's likeable about her at the moment? Not much. She needs a "save the cat" moment (google for examples) to make her sympathetic for the reader. Well done on not making her a Mary Sue though.

-We never see Hagrid call Professor McGonagall "Minerva" in canon, he's usually very respectful of the other teachers.

-The hat doesn't talk out loud in canon, Harry only hears its deliberations in his head.

-There's nothing in canon to suggest Angelina would say "aye" instead of yes, so it feels very odd. It's fairly common from Scottish or very northern people in the UK, but I would advise giving characters strong dialects/regional slang like this unless it's specifically in canon.

-I'm also not sure they're quite at the age where they'd start fancying each other. We're talking about 11 year olds, romance shouldn't be coming into it yet.

It's a really nice start, I'll read some more later. My first impressions are to think carefully about the /purpose/ of having an OC over choosing a minor character. Writing an OC is ambitious, and I generally advise first-time writers to use one-shots and/or more major characters to practice writing before moving on to create their own complex stories. Not to say that you shouldn't do it! You've just set yourself up for quite a challenge.

As for what's o and what's not ok - it's fanfiction. Anything goes. Don't worry about other people, write fanfiction because you /enjoy/ it and because you /want/ to improve your writing. :)

******* You know what, I was going to put the second review here, but I'll just post them all on the story :) I'll post this first review there too so it's all in the same place.

******** I'm halfway through ch2 now, and will review soon.

-Yes, grammar is a bit of an issue for you. Not terrible, far better than most, but enough of a problem that it's distracting. I realise it's very dull, but do plenty of research on punctuation (especially commas), dialogue, and homophones.

-Character personality, no, not as such, you just have to be aware of common cliches and pet peeves. Have you filled out a character study form? That might be helpful. [[http://fanfiction.mugglenet.com/forums/showthread.php?885-Character-Forms-and-Guidelines-for-Use][Here]] is a good one.

-I actually like where you started the story, just because I get tired of every first year story starting with the main character getting their letter, and these chapters tend to become info dumps. Perhaps a more interesting way of doing it would be doing it from Professor Sprout's point of view? That way you won't be giving too much away about Rav, but you can make it clear she's from a foster home.

-You won't offend anyone. Fanfic is filled with out of character characters, some people actually prefer that. Fanfic is a big big world - please don't ever hold back from writing anything because you're afraid of the reaction. You should do this for /you/ and only /you/. But maybe, as well as writing your OC, you could write a one-shot or two about a character we already know. It doesn't have to be a main character, but it's actually a good skill to write a character that isn't your own. It helps you learn to stick to a specific personality for your character, avoiding your own original characters becoming boring self-inserts. It's very good writing practice, and when you really know a character you can focus on other things. I eased myself back into fanfic after a long break by writing DH from Ginny's POV. Don't feel like you have to do this or anything, it just might be a fun way to practice :)

-Have you written out the plans? Character forms, timelines, mindmaps and so on can really help some people. Like I said, you've picked an ambitious project for your first fic, but I know you can do it, you're already head and shoulders above most first-time writers.

-Yes. Go to Doc Manager, and click "replace/update chapter". Then you can C&P your corrected document and replace the one that's up.

******** Also, I forgot to say in my review, but on your 2nd chapter, you have "chapter 3" written at the top. Did you miss a chapter?

********** Ooh boy, betas are hard to find nowadays. Try asking here, on forums like the teacher's lounge on ff.net, Mugglenet fanfic forums, gently approaching authors you admire, etc. You have to be quite proactive!

Sounds like you've been super ambitious, which is great! Very exciting, just don't run out of steam. Best of luck finding a beta, I'd do it myself but just don't have the time, I'm afraid!

**** I like it so far! Rav is vulnerable, identifiable, definitely someone worth following. I've seen the idea of the Weasley twins pranks being not as innocent as perceived in the original story, and I like where you could be going with it.

And I love her interaction with Snape. Your Snape is a little toned down to how I typically think of him, but it made me quick to remember that Snape was a quiet withdrawn student, and he would have sympathy. Have you read A Difference in the Family: A Snape Chronicles? It is a very good Snape and that story could provide you with some inspiration on how you wish to write your Snape, although you did a good job in Chapter 2 so I'm not sure you need help with that.

Critiques? I'm always much better at praising than criticism. Do you have a beta? Some grammar mistakes I noticed, nothing to big, but for instance you misspelled "Filch", some of your sentence structure with dialogue was off (honestly though I get confused by that a lot). Dialogue is always a struggle for nearly every writer. I'd just advise that when you write something, always try to hear those words and if someone would really say that. Sometimes dialogue gets too wordy because authors try to tell the story through it, when really that's not how someone would talk. Also, I'd love to see a little more backstory on Rav. I don't know if that will just come out as you go through your story, but I'd love it if Chapter 1 was just Rav being woken on the train (because I like how you started the story with her already on her way) but give us more of her thoughts instead of being shoved out and onto boats and getting sorted so instantaneously. I'd love to read her remembering the day Sprout came to her, and what she felt when she was told she was a witch, her trip to Diagon Alley to get her wand and robes, etc. Also, we've never heard about how Hogwarts handles poor students, so maybe hearing how it was explained to her would be an interesting insight.

Okay, just realized that was a lot of rambling about the story. Bottom line though, I think your story shows a lot of promise as a good story. Your storytelling and attention to detail is pretty solid. Your OC main character is getting developed well (although I'd love to read more at the start). Keep writing, keep updating, and the favorites and follows will come.

****** I'm pretty much an amateur in the writing portion of fanfiction so there are others who could better advise I'm sure. But a beta is basically an editor. They can read your stories before posting, provide both story-writing advice, proofreading, maybe even just to ask questions, give suggestions, to see if you've thought of writing a sentence a certain way.

And I think no matter how long it's taken, it's really cool that you're finally getting it out there and public. It puts the pressure on you to get your story out but in a good way. And the pensieve lookback is a great idea. My thought was maybe not so much a look back on her situation and life as an orphan, but just more about telling us how she ended up on the train. Like I said, I love that you open up with her on the train. It sort of gives the reader that feeling that she probably has of just being thrown into the mix. But a little look back to her being told by Sprout and shopping and stuff may just give us a bit of a glance into her backstory but still focused on her journey to Hogwarts.

And I'm sure you can edit your chapters because I see edits on people's stories, although as a reader only on the site I don't have the details on how to go about doing that. Website might have an FAQ or something for writers to help you out.

** Honestly I don't follow stories, I just keep them loaded on my chrome tabs. It much easier. I'm sure others do the same so I wouldn't worry about followers just views :) also I rarely ever review, andni know others don't bother as well so I wouldn't worry about that either
