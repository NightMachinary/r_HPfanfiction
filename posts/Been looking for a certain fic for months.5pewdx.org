It's a fic about Fem Harry and Cedric being transported to the Pokemon world and Fem Harry joins Team Rocket and Cedric joins the police. It's been driving me crazy, I can't find it anywhere!


** Are you sure it wasn't a fever dream?

*** If it was a dream, it was a pretty damn specific one. I can remember certain details about how it was written, what words they used, certain scenes, and where(irl) I read it. I wasn't exaggerating on the months, it's been about 4 months since I first remembered reading it and I still haven't found it...
