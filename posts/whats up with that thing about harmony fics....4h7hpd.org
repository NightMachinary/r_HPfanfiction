where they make mcgonagall like obsessed with alcohol/constantly drinking whenever anything happens ever. i dont get this trope if it can be considered one? what kind of teacher starts doing shots in front of like 11 year olds just because they mentioned some problems with the school or accidentally soulbonded or whatever the heck the fic is about


** Perhaps it's because she's Scottish, and [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INeedAFreakingDrink][I Need A Freaking Drink]] is a fun way to relieve tension.

Never seen that. And I've read a lot of weird fics.

  Sequel to The Power of Love: Voldemort is back, the Ministry is in denial, and Dumbledore is stalling, but Jasmine isn't alone. She and Hermione are supported by new friends, defended by two shieldmaidens, and empowered by ancient magic. Eliminating Voldemort is the least of the tasks which prophecy expects from them, but how will these witches transform the whole magical world?

** For the soul bond: it's usually wish fulfilment. Also, wouldn't you grab a drink if you were the ones responsible for the golden trio? Especially when they're reporting some unbelievable adventure and risked life and limb under your watch? I'll sure as hell grab for a shot if not the whole bottle if I'm at the end of one of those stories.

** It came about the usual way. One author inserts a bit of flavour by having the Scottish teacher appreciate whisky. Another author comes along and uses that same flavour to characterize her and has her drink a bit too much as as unhealthy coping mechanism.

And now we arrive at the critical point of fan incompetence. Yet another author reads those fics where she drinks, doesn't understand why it was put in bbut likes it and puts it in their own story. But because they have no idea about scale or experience with people they overdo it and their fan club picks it up from there.

*** McGonagall having an alcohol problem would explain a lot of her actions. Like sending kids into the Forbidden Forest as a detention.

**** In the books she's never depecicted as having an alcohol problem, like Trewlawney. I would say she drinks in moderation most of the time.

I agree that she sometimes doesn't have the best judgment, but I don't think it's because of alcohol

** I've never seen this, but it sounds hilarious. Then again, I usually give up on H/Hr fics shortly after I start them.
