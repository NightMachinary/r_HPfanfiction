I have read of this phenomenon in some fics, were Harry starts practicing the Dark Arts (sometimes reluctantly, sometimes because he's dark) and its featured like being addicted to drugs.

I have found nothing specifically dealing with the issue, so I was wondering in there is any fic (preferable LF) like this. I don't care if it is gen, het, slash, Dark!Harry Confused!Harry o Light!Harry.

It would be good to read how this affects him psychologically too.

  Torn from a desolate future, Harry awakens in his teenage body with a hefty debt on his soul. Entangled in his lies and unable to trust even his own fraying sanity, he struggles to stay ahead of his enemies. Desperation is the new anthem of violence.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  It is a man's own mind, not his enemy or foe, that lures him to evil ways. Harry is prepared to do anything to protect those he still has left, even use the Dark Arts extensively if he has to. The question is; will he be the same person in the end as events, and a shadowy figure risk to change him? And how does the eccentric Daphne Greengrass fit in? Sixth year. HP/DG
