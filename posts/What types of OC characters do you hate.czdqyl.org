I mean this more what roles do you hate for OCs as opposed to say the potrayal of one like making them Mary Sues or OCs who have a particular personality trait would be the potrayal so wouldn't count. That OC could have been characterized differently.

But for example hating OCs who are related to major canon characters ( Ex Sirius's kids) would count that is their role their premise etc.

Why do you hate it? Is there a way it could be done where you wouldn't hate it? Or is it just the concept itself you hate?


** Americans. Especially long-lost relatives of canon characters that are American.

I have read exactly one (1) fic that had one such character that I really liked...and I really liked the fic but not necessarily the character.

In real life I'm an American with British cousins, so it's not like I don't believe that sort of thing can happen. I just don't want to see it in my Harry Potter stories...also it's extremely poorly done 99.9% of the time.

** Sirius (and Bellatrix) having kids in a canon world. Anyone else, I'm just fine with. There's not one single moment where either could have had a kid.

I despise the OC sister who's sorted into Slytherin, falls in love with Draco or Snape, and hates her brother. And the one that's raised by Snape and Harry is left with the Dursleys. I hate it when it's the reverse, too. I'm fine with siblings hating each other, but don't try to sell it that Draco is more pleasant or that it's not super creepy that Snape loves/favors Lily's red haired daughter with green eyes.

The OC love interest or sidekick (or one with a canon name) that becomes equally important to the plot of destroying Voldemort. I get it. You don't like the arm candy that's just there. But Voldemort belongs to Harry Potter and Albus Dumbledore. It's entirely possible to have a talented/defined love interest or sidekick without making him or her a vital part of Voldemort's destruction.

Except for the years they had between school and Azkaban. Sirius only had four, but Bellatrix had about ten years where she could have had a kid. And, at least in Sirius' case, sometimes once is all that's necessary.

*** I actually want to read a fic where Snape favors the daughter who looks like Lily to the point that everyone else is creeped out.

Or a fic where he is actually remorseful for his poor treatment of said daughter.

But alas, no one does it.

I don't follow the logic here at all. Granted, it would have been hard for Bellatrix to hide a pregnancy, especially during the canon period, but Sirius would have had ample opportunities before he went to Azkaban, and post-Azkaban, canon only shows what he was doing for quite short periods. He could easily have had a relationship or dozens of one night stands had he been so inclined. He would hardly have talked to Harry about it. And in fact, it did occur to Harry that there might have been something going on with Tonks.

**** u/Ash_Lestrange:

#+end_quote

Right, he would've talked with his friends about it, especially a relationship and a kid. There's a letter from Lily discussing Harry's 1st birthday and the events of the outside world during that time. And nothing in Sirius' actions, pre and post Azkaban, suggests he even put himself in that position.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

No, Harry thinks Tonks might have been in love with Sirius and, looking at the statement as a whole, that's probably a deliberate choice of words given the title of the book.

***** Some people don't talk about their relationships, especially if they aren't serious. Plus, the fact that it isn't mentioned only means that it isn't mentioned, not that it can't have happened. It's one letter discussing Harry's birthday: that isn't evidence that he didn't have any relationships. There are dozens of reasons why it might not be mentioned and there are plenty of spaces in Sirius's story to fill without affecting canon in the least. Plus it would be perfectly possible for him to father a child without knowing about it. However, assuming that there is some magical way to know that he had no heir (male heir, as it seems primogeniture was practiced in the Black family) and was therefore free to leave his estate to Harry, any potential offspring would have to be female.

It seems to me that you want the canon to be narrower and more restricted than it needs to be. As fanfiction writers, I think we should be expanding on Rowling's creation, not making it smaller.

No, I want fan fictions to make sense. And the idea of Sirius fathering a child, even unknowingly, doesn't make sense to me.

** The clingy Female OC straight out of Mills&Boons or Harlequin Romance (where the female OC is shown as a pseudo-independent protagonist, but still leans on her 'man' for saving the day)

Also, throw in an attempted assault/rape, and I'm done with the fic!

**** Exactly! The worst part is it ruined the Canon characterization for me! I used to love Hermione as bad ass Witch, now it's slightly colored by her weak portrayals and getting raped/or almost raped.. it's like 70s-80s Hollywood all over again. And the worst part if there is almost no warnings in fanfiction.net and if its's an attempt/chavunism, I don't see it tagged appropriately in AO3

** I've seen half a dozen or so fics with Harry having a super quirky/hot/poly mentor or something along those lines and it makes me throw up in my mouth a little bit. It wouldn't be so bad if the character introduced didn't always successfully brainwash everyone into her way of thinking "lul your mentors suck and so does monogamy"

** How would you feel about an OC who is the child of Voldemort /and/ the cousin of Harry? But instead of them being edgy and struggling to be ‘light' or ‘dark', they're just a normal magical kid who so happens to be Voldemort's kid?

** For some reason on AO3 every harry/female OC pairing has some sort of shitty romantic angst with draco/OC and Cedric/OC.

And of course the OC is powerful in some way, independent, sassy and immature

** Pretty much all of them. I'll let it slide if they don't do much and are tertiary at best (Rita Skeeter can't possibly make all of the Daily Prophet articles, no matter what some may think) but I draw the line if they're introduced and are quickly found to be Sues.
