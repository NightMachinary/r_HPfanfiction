Every fanfic i find where its dumbledore (most common ) or someone from the golden trio is bashed, they become so one sided and fake (i.e. Villains from a cartoon) . Maybe I can't find the right ones ?


** If I remember right, Core Threads linkffn(10136172) may count, some very light bashing of Ron, but it's more that he's just a kid with the maturity of one that wants to be friends with Harry at first, than anything else.

Also it could be considered bashing of Dumbledore, very loosely, in that he goes from slightly offbeat into full on insanity, but still somehow competent.

I think that's the problem really, bashing of characters that is written well and still makes them feel like real people to some extent is subtle rather than right in your face, so much so that it hardly counts as bashing at all.

#+end_quote

He speaks far less, and he hides a plot device in a cabbage instead of, you know, giving it to anyone or doing anything about it, probably making fun of the snitch thing, amping it to 11.

That's inconsistent with canon I'd say.

I thought it was bashing his offbeatness at the very least, or rather it at least could have been, who knows, you/I'd have to ask the author to know for sure.

***** In the early books (which are the time frame for /Core Threads/), when does Dumbledore speak a lot outside of the "Dumbledore Explains It All" scenes? His start-of-term speech in /Philosopher's Stone/ is literally four words long. And I don't think the "hiding MacGuffin in cabbage" thing is unthinkable for Canon Dumbledore, though that's of course a debatable point, as long as no actual risk was incurred by putting in the cabbage. And chances are there were quite a few protective spells on this cabbage, just in case. I don't think it's essentially different from the Stone-in-Snitch thing, or from putting Baby Harry on the Dursleys' doorstep without even knocking as though he was a bottle of milk or something.

** There really aren't any good bashing fics, because bashing is by definition over the top senseless hatred on a certain character.

I'm guessing what your looking for is more like a character being seen in negative light by the MC and thus having their faults be far more noticeable and relevant. Perhaps slightly exaggerated but still keeping it at reasonable levels.

Fics that come to mind like that: linkffn(11446957) and linkffn(6254783) In them you can see that authors are trying to get rid of Ron and Hermione but also tries to keep it somewhat plausible and realistic.

*** Well, if you define "bashing" as "without merit", then you aren't going to be able to find an example of bashing that has merit, are you? But that's not an argument, that's a tautology.

If you define "bashing" as "exaggerating or distorting a canon character's faults, often to the point of parody," then you're still leaving room for enjoyable fiction that uses bashing. Personal taste in fiction is all very subjective, not so?

So to answer the OP's question: sure, there's all kinds of well-written parody that uses "bashing", but from the way you've asked you don't seem interested in parody. I guess it comes down to how much you dislike a given character's set of canon traits to determine how much exaggeration you can tolerate and still enjoy an otherwise well-written story. Kind of hard to gauge that from your question.

Me, for example, I dislike canon Dumbledore a lot and find a lot of behavior from canon Ron, Molly and Minerva annoying, so I can tolerate quite a bit of "bashing" of those characters if the writing is good, the other characters are solid, or the plot is interesting or amusing. Your tastes appear to be different, which is fine.

**** In canon Harry hates Snape and Malfoy, but Malfoy and Snape aren't bashed, because JK Rowling doesn't hate them. Bashing has nothing to do with a story and everything to do with an author projecting.

You can make traditionally liked characters into antagonists. You can make the protagonist just not like someone. You can do all of this without bashing. You say you like well written bashing, but that is an oxymoron. Bashing is an indicator of poor writing. Either the author couldn't handle proper characterization or they're just using a character, or the narration as a mouth piece to voice their opinions. Both of which are bad writing.
