Kind of a very open ended request, no?

Looking for fics where the characters or the setting itself are the myths and legends of the future. Terrible, otherwordly Voldemort, a Heroic Harry (and company), powerful and skilled enough to become the present time's Greek heroes of old.

Just anything grandiose and over-the-top so that millenia after people still remember the tale of the Dark One and His rival, the... Uhh... Peacebringer? Lightbringer?
