I've been looking through HP fanfic for a while, and while some sites have more straight-forward search engines, livejournal is notoriously difficult to navigate. It's a shame because I tend to prefer livejournal fic quality over FFnet or AO3. I've found a couple of livejournal communities that I like for finding fic, and was wondering if anyone else had some to share. They're all currently inactive, but have a good selection of fic to browse.

[[http://omniocular.livejournal.com/][Omniocular]], [[http://springtime-gen.livejournal.com/][Springtime Gen]], [[http://hp-holidaygen.livejournal.com/][Holiday Gen]]: All separate gen fic communities, with a good selection.

[[http://quinquatrus.livejournal.com/][quinquartus]]: McGonagall-centric community


** Pornish Pixies is the oldest smut community, and it has a ton of stuff.
