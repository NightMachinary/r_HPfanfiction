:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I was looking for a fanfiction that i read a while back. I think that in the story the point of view was from a female character. Although I'm not sure if it was a female Harry or some other character. But I do know that in the story. The protagonist performs a exorcism on professor Binns and has Narcissa Malfoy teach magical history from then on. It's a possibility that the main character was a female Harry or was perhaps a younger or maybe time traveler Bellatrix.


** I thought I had read a fic like this recently, but it turns out the one I was thinking of doesn't quite match your description. Boo :(

However, if you're interested in a fic with a dimension-travelling fem!Harry who exorcises Binns and takes over the History professorship /herself/ rather than having Cissy Milfoy do it... this one's pretty damn good.
