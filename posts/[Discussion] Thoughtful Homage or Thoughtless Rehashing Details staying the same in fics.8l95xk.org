So I wanted to see what you lovely people thought about this. In short: how do you feel when, against all odds, smaller events and other details stay completely the same as in the original stories? I'm not talking about canon rehashes where the plot follows the same beats as canon (though feel free to rant about that if you want), more like when Unique! Harry #15687 whose pretty much an OC in all but name inexplicably names his bird-type pet 'Hedwig'. Or flying lessons happening almost the /exact same way/ with Neville falling and dropping his remembrall.


** You have to consider if your changes would impact the situation. Harry being raised by Andromeda wouldn't stop Malfoy from being a dick, Voldemort from trying to kill him or the Ministry from organising a Triwizard Tournament. But if you want to keep stuff Harry did the same, you better have a good explanation ready. For example, make up some historical event where a Hedwig was a total BAMF and have Harry like the story so he picks that name for his pet.

The same goes for interpersonal stuff. Lets say that Harry ran into Tonks on the Hogwarts Express and she took him under her wing. The one nice person he knows best is a Hufflepuff, so being the abused and neglected child he was, Harry would want to be a Hufflepuff as well. He would make different friends. If you want an eventual Hermione romance, then you better keep them distant until they both grew up. They only became friends over a shared hardship, so either come up with something original (they run into Sirius during the third year) or bend some canon event to serve as catalyst (Harry sees Hermione at the Yule Ball). Don't try to force certain canon events (friendships, the Graveyard fight, the Horcrux hunt) just for the sake of including them.

Tl;dr: Personal stuff and interactions should be different, the rest should stay the same. If you want to change something, make up a plausible explanation.

*** Yeah, the big strokes can be annoying when they're painted the exact same. The Hermione one is a good example of that, if Harry were in Hufflepuff, by what we see in canon, they probably wouldn't interact much, if at all. And it's definitely something writers should think about.

I'm more interested in the little things though, like Harry still getting Griphook as his guide to the vault, despite coming on a different day without Hagrid or anything. Do you see that as just a fun little wink and nod, or lazy writing?

**** It depends. If he's just random Goblin No17 and serves no further purpose? Nothing wrong with that, they ought to have shifts after all (although ot would be suspicious if it always is Griphook, no matter if it's midnight on Christmas eve or Tuesday the 14th, 4PM).

Just don't overdo this kind of fanservice. It's nice once or twice, but it becomes cringeworthy at a certain point because those kinds of things feel forced very quickly.

** A lot of this stuff is grounded in understanding why things have changed, how things are happening and not just going with what happened in canon with no explanation. If you're doing it, lay the groundwork. Bigger changes can draw their roots from the small ones without it seeming like we've just pulled it out of our backsides. We also don't want everything to be the exact same, because we've all read the books, no one wants to just see the exact same story. In AU, I feel like you need to justify not just non-canon things happening but canon things. Build your world through the story. Striking that balance is hard, but makes for a more satisfying read than just doing it because it happened that way in canon.

** Sometimes it's really cringey. I don't like it when fics get too referential. An example of this that I saw recently: While Draco and Harry are talking, Draco says "I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks" and /Draco and Harry both start laughing/. My problem with this is that it's the kind of conversation that fans remember because it's iconic, but the characters probably /wouldn't/ remember a conversation they had when they were 11 years old. It feels like a wink from the author to the reader, rather than keeping the characters on track, and it breaks immersion.

An example I read of somebody doing this right was in an AU where Harry doesn't find out he's a wizard until he's 17. He goes to Diagon Alley and the trip to Ollivander's is pretty similar, but Draco is accompanying him, which changes the dynamic; he then goes to the pet shop but doesn't have a lot of money, so they offer him an older owl, which turns out to be an older Hedwig. That actually felt really nice to read!

*** Wait so was the context of the first fic that they went back in time or something? Is that why it's remembering the conversation?

Also, that Hedwig thing is actually something that would annoy me a little. Like, I can understand it from a homage point of view, or it being for the readers, but logically it just kind of comes across as very unlikely. If I read that in a story, my first reaction would definitely be "...Really?" followed by "So no one else bought this beautiful, intelligent, snowy owl because... Destiny or something?"

**** No, they were having a conversation as adults, and laughing because they apparently remembered Harry saying it to Draco as 11-year-olds.

Yeah, I can understand that. In the fic ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278/chapters/16653022][Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run]]), it's kind of explained that what with the war having escalated so much (Harry having never gone to Hogwarts and thwarted Voldemort's plans), people didn't want flashy white owls, so she's been there a long time.

***** Okay that makes sense I guess. Did he still call it Hedwig though? Because that's the kind of thing the beggars belief

****** Oh yeah I hadn't thought of that; the shop call her Hedwig and it had been so long since I read the books that I assumed that's where her name came from originally, but it's not, is it? So scratch that from my list of good examples! The scene at Ollivander's is still good tho. I recommend the fic!

*** I don't know... it /was/ a very big day for both of them --- the day they started Hogwarts, the train ride even --- in their place I /would/ remember what happened that day pretty well, especially if it was the first conversation in a long rivalry.
