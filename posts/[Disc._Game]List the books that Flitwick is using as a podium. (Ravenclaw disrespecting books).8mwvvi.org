**** Almost certainly. William's force that he took to England was not very big, about 7000-8000 men by most estimates. Armand Malfoy would be one of these, but he'd have left plenty of relatives behind - brothers, sons, etc.

If Armand had two sons, he might well have given his French lands to one of them and his English lands to the other. Plenty of real Norman noblemen did this, and in at least one case it solved an incipient problem - that of Robert de Beaumont, who had twin sons. Robert gave the larger, more valuable and older French title of Count of Meulan to the elder twin Waleran, and most of the English possessions (Earl of Leicester among them) that he'd scored through the Norman Conquest went to the younger twin Robert.

********* Hm, I see. Personally I'm always inclined to a wide canon; but either way, Rowling /has/ said that /she/ considers the story of /Cursed Child/ canon, so I don't see why the loose plot of it wouldn't have the same level of canonicity as any other Word of God we've gotten on Twitter or /Pottermore/. Note that she said "story", which conveniently allows us to fudge any details that are too ridiculous; Delphini doubtless exists, but maybe Ron holding his wand backwards or Albus Severus saying he doesn't like Quidditch was just an embellishment.

(Also and thirdly, didn't Rowling write down the plot of /Cursed Child/ before Thorne and Tiffany expanded it into a play?)

********** It's a bit more complex than that.

Thorne, Tiffany and Rowling co-write a short story. It was always collaborative - which makes it very different from the original books - and Rowling's input seemed to be mostly in allowing them to use characters and concepts she'd already created, rather than adding anything new. All the new stuff came from Thorne and Tiffany.

That's where the debate comes in. If all the new material the play offers is made up by sources that aren't Jo, is that canon or high end fanfic?

We don't usually consider /Death Comes to Pemberley/ as canon for /Pride and Prejudice/ for much the same reason. We COULD, but we usually don't. Legal permission from the copyright holder to use the existing stuff, but any new stuff cane from a new author, so what is it?

Thorne then later adapted the short story into a script for the stage.

Personally I have no clear opinion. I haven't seen the play yet, and I don't want to make up my mind until I do...BUT I can see why debate might exist, and until that's resolved I'll call it a maybe rather than a definite yes or no.

Cursed Child seems to fit into a weird in-between space in some ways. It's only very, very recently that authors have been able to have the kind of real-time interaction with fans that Jo enjoys so much. I'm not sure what this is yet.

It ... does and it doesn't. History of The English Legal System time: up until the statute /Quia Emptores/ of 1290, having a big family isn't a bad idea. You can subinfeudinate new manors* out of your land grant so that land split between several sons remained 'in the family' because the cadet branches of the family become your liege people. After the Statute, newly parcelled-out manors (if any) are held of your liege lord, not of you as tenant-in-chief. Which means that cadet lines, if they come up spendthrift, end up selling out to bigger players and you get 800lb gorillas like York and Lancaster.

That starts the trend toward the practise of "an heir, a spare, and a daughter" becoming the ideal. Second and third sons can be sent off to the church or to make their fortunes overseas, but they still require maintenance - late mediaeval/early modern 'remittance men' - which are a net drain on the family wealth. Wouldn't do to have one of your brats turn up a pauper somewhere, after all. Your grandchildren you can be a bit more lackadaisical about, but poor relations are still something of an embarrassment for later generations. Best to keep the cadet branches of the family to a minimum: connections and power are all very well, but they are things of the moment. Keeping the land and wealth in the family was far more serious business.

The dodges and legalities required to tie down an estate more than you could manage with simple inheritance-by-primogeniture gave rise to Uses, which in turn begat Trusts, Settlements and Entailments which in the corrupt and scheming cauldron of the Court of Chancery** became modern estate planning law which, up until the 1925 reforms required the very supplest of legal minds to navigate. It's still a bit of a maze of twisty little precedents, all alike, but up until the 19th Century Chancery was its own separate jurisdiction with its own rules and now I'm having horrible flashbacks to my Equity And Law Of Trusts final so I'm going to stop.

* Which is NOT a big house, umpty million fanfics about wizarding homes notwithstanding. The Big House of Blackacre Manor might be called Blackacre Manor House, but it usually wasn't. Naming traditions vary by region: where I live they're usually called Whatever Hall, or if fortified, Example Tower.

******** Yes, yes, I know this. :)

But we were talking about Armand Malfoy. if we're talking about Armand specifically, he predates /Quia Emptores/ by more than a century. Just because the modern Malfoys that we know of have had just the one son per generation is no reason to assume that the Malfoy progenitor who came over with William the Bastard would stop at one. Armand is actually arguably better served by having several, as it allows him to divide the inheritance and the feudal duties that come with it into much more manageable chunks.

It would be totally believable for there to still be a Malfoy branch in France after Armand left for England - even if there wasn't one on the day he left, any sons he had after that date would very likely have claim to lands in France as well as England, and take possession accordingly. How long that branch /survives/, I have no idea, but it would be there for a while.

********* Totally not going to touch french mediaeval estate planning :) My ability to spin horror stories about generational resettlements and the fiendishness of Chancery pales, /pales/ I say, against the insanity that the Kingdom of France practised among its upper crust. Not least because they didn't have a common law for the whole nation until Napoleon's time, so inheritances could and did become dodecahedral conflict-of-laws problems, when a lord had holdings - as mesne tenant or tenant-in-chief, and that was /another/ wrinkle - in six different jurisidictions, made his will in a seventh and died on crusade. You could be forgiven for thinking that a lot of the warfare was down to sheer frustration.
