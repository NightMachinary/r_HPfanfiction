As the title suggests, I'm looking for Sytherin!Harry, Slytherin!Hermione or Slytherin!Ron fics (or a combination of any of those). Preferably something complete, but WIPs that update frequently are fine. Something of the caliber of /Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin/ would be nice, but idk if there's anything out there that comparable. Mentor!Snape would be a plus.

Thanks!!

  When Ron Weasley realized he was reborn to the world with his memories mostly intact, he felt it was a second chance to do better. However, he slowly realizes that this world was different from his own. Making new friends and earning new enemies, he has to use his experience from his previous life not only to reach his goals, but also to survive. AU

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6439871/1/A-Different-Halloween][A Different Halloween]] by robst, linkffn(6439871), has both Harry and Hermione going to Slytherin. It's not bad for a 'feel good' story.

My favorite Slytherin!Hermione fic remains [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/][Applied Cultural Anthropology, Or]], linkffn(9238861). It's unfortunately on hiatus.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/1/][Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches]], linkffn(11574569), is another good Slytherin!Harry and Hermione fic. Year 2 is about to begin and we can expect Luna and Ginny to end up there too.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545), is a fun time travel. Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Susan all ended up in Slytherin. But due to their actions, the house was already unrecognizable when they got there.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/][Hail Odysseus]], linkffn(10645463), bashes almost everyone with a few exceptions including Snape. It dealt with lots of shit that went on in Slytherin. Hermione's name appeared a total of 7 times and was already thoroughly bashed.

My favorite Slytherin!Harry remains [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10493620/1/][Ruthless]], linkffn(10493620). It's a little short, but wonderfully written.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.

*** Read that one already -- the tags almost made me not read it, but I was doing a read-through of all the Slytherin!Hermione fics on ao3 and figured I'd give it a shot. Was glad I did!

Thanks for responding, though!

  After swearing I was done tinkering with the first entry in the series, the Muse struck me. Essentially the same story, but with a more solid introduction to the new characters. Names changed to protect the innocent. Less canon text. More Snape!

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** linkao3(Pathetic, Ordinary, Liars by Orcusnox (Cat9894)) All three are in slytherin. It's okay. It seems to be going the route of Dark!Grey!Golden trio though.

linkao3(The King's Indian Attack by Nectere) Slytherin Harry and Hermione. Aurora Sinistra has a pretty big role here.

The best Slytherin Harry is linkffn(On the Way to Greatness by mira mirth)

Wholeheartedly second Applied Cultural Anthropology.

You wanted one of the trio but you should check out linkffn(The Changeling by Annerb) which is Slytherin Ginny. Very well-written and superb characterization.

  Aurora Sinistra spends most of her time watching the stars. She's no centaur, but she's better than Trelawney. In the summer of 1991, she has a plan redeem the reputation of Slytherin House, and maybe some of the people inside it. Recruiting Severus Snape to help her over a game of chess, the two teachers undertake a gambit of their own that leads the Boy-Who-Lived and the Brightest Witch of Her Age into Slytherin House and friendships with Draco Malfoy. However, there is something strange going on at the school. Can the three figure out what it is that Professor Quirrell is up to and stop it? How will the changes in House and friendships effect Harry's relationship with Dumbledore and the headmaster's plans?
