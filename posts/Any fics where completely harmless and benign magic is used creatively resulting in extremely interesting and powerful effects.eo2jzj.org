Example: Give me a bunch of always-full water bottles, some jars full of everlasting fire and I will move a pretty big space rock on a collision course with the home of my enemy at a few hundred kilometers per second.

Water + fire = high pressure steam, run it through a nozzle and you get force (F = v * dm/dt) without using up reaction mass, breaking the tyranny of the Tsiolkovsky equation, therefore enabling accelerating arbitrary things to arbitrary velocities given enough time.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

  This started as a short story about how nerd weaponizes light. Now it is 'how quickly can we cover the entire Harry Potter series while adding progressively more technology and research into the mix.' Still a stupid story for the sake of stupid stories, though. Enjoy

*** I was going to make a prompt about this. One of the first spells taught to students is a Dark spell of the tallest order.

Add in a sprinkle of Harry the Hufflepuff, and I can see the teacher introduce a new spell. Harry opens his mouth and the scene changes to smoke, fire, screams of pain, and Hermione yelling at Harry.

  COMPLETE. Two years after defeating Voldemort, Harry falls into an alternate dimension with his godfather. Together, they embark on a new life filled with drunken debauchery, thievery, and generally antagonizing all their old family, friends, and enemies.

** I toyed with this a bit in a one shot collection.

Linkffn(The Phoenix Grimoire)

Basically, Harry screws up a banishing charm that cancels momentum, and ends up launching someone away from the planet at escape velocity.

  Harry Potter found that the spells he was learning in books did not quite do the job. So he recruited the three smartest witches he knew and set them loose. The Wizarding World will never be the same. A collection of loosely connected one-shots focused on ridiculous spell ideas and the little-known dangers of fooling around with Magic.
