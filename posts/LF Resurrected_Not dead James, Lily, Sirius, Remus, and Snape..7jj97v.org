Hey there! I'm looking for fics where those mentioned in the title either never died and just went away (in James and Lily's case) or were brought back to life by any mean some time after their death.


** The amazing linkffn(You did What by nonjon), sequel to linkffn(Where in the world is Harry Potter) fits.

*** Thanks for the suggestion! I will check it out. Do you know any other fics like that or a community that revolve around fics like these?

** Well, I brought Sirius back in this one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11044336/1/Finding-the-Way-Home]]

It's a sequel to another fic but I think it makes sense on its own, though it doesn't feature much of the wizarding world and there aren't many other canon characters in it.

It's also probably due for an overhaul but that won't happen anytime soon.

**** I'm afraid I don't. I have seen quite a lot of fics where Snape doesn't die but I don't have any of them favourited to share.
