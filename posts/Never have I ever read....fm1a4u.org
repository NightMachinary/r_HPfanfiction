#+begin_quote
  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.

**** It's hilarious and well written, but its critiques of the defences of the Stone are (like all the ones I've seen( entirely rooted in supposition. For example, it presumes that Fluffy is something anyone should have known about and that he could be easily killed. Yet the canonical answer is that no-one knew what he was (including Hermione) and the notoriously kill happy Voldemort didn't kill him. It makes a lot more sense to presume that they were, in fact, lucky (that in HP Fluffy was very unusual and, perhaps, immune to Avada Kedavra). That, at least, doesn't sit oddly with canon.

(The troll really is a dud defence, mind... which the fic kind of disagree with, weirdly. But the Devil's Snare's other canon appearance was to assassinate a wizard in a hospital that requires its staff to have advanced knowledge of herbology, we've got no idea how good Ron is at chess etc. etc.)

It's fairer when it's asking questions about the Mirror or the Detention, of course.

*** Consider:

- Blood Magic by Gateway Girl on ao3

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/719610]]

It is a "Snape is Harry's biological father" fic. The main focus of the story is on the father-son relationship that starts to develop between Harry and Snape, but in addition Snape is shipped with Lupin. It is pretty low-key and I think it is an excellent introduction into anything-fanfic as well as anything-Snape.

- Darkness and Light series by R. J. Anderson on ffnet

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4446/R-J-Anderson]]

It is about a female OC named Maud Moody who is blind and has a complicated history with one Severus Snape. It was originally written before OOTP came out and then later changed to make it more canon-compliant with OOTP. IIRC the story roughly covers Harry's 5th year onwards up to one year after the defeat of LV. Bc it was written so early, it is not canon-compliant, but I find it a fun read nevertheless.

I am not a fan of OCs and I rarely read Snape shipped with a woman, but this one really stands out. I read it ages ago when it first came out and it was still unfinished and have re-read it many times.

- The Most Powerful Magic by cjr2

After 20 years in coma Severus Snape wakes up. He finds himself taken in by the extended Potter-Malfoy family. Harry and Ginny have broken up and Ginny is now married to Draco Malfoy and expecting her fourth child. Severus' recovery is slow, but during the time his body heals he slowly falls in love with one Harry Potter.

The story explores the connection between magic and love or the question why there weren't other instances were the killing curse did not work bc somebody sacrificed themselves.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2457953]]

EDIT:

Lavender Brown POV - check out Northumbrian's universe. There are some Lavender-centric stories in there, but the best Lavender parts are contained in the Harry-Ginny stories.

*** You could tick off the first 4 with "Fate is a Four Letter Word" by Philo on Ao3.

Don't be scared, I would not recommend a story somebody who dislikes the above unless it was really good. :D

It is a story about 40+ year old Harry with adult kids. Harry has a career as a carpenter, Lily is still in Hogwarts but Al and James are graduated. To outsiders he is happily married to Ginny, but it soon becomes clear in the story that their marriage is long over and that Ginny has somebody else in her life.

Ginny gets murdered and Harry and his friends and family need to catch Ginny's killer. To the ministry it is an old tale of jealousy and a love gone wrong, while Harry and his friends quickly suspect political motives.

It is a great "who-dune-it" and "catch the conspirators" with plenty of plot twists, but I absolutely love it for its portrayal of the characters as real adults with real adult problems. It goes into what it means to be family and what it means to be a parent and especially what it means to be a good, responsible father. It explores trust issues as well. Lots of funny moments on top.

The genderbending is light (people taking polyjuice), Ron and Hermione are not the main pairing but they are big part of the story and there are believable tender moments between them, Next Gen is a given due to the time line, slash is heavy, bc one of the plot points is that Harry figures out that he is bisexual with a preferance for guys and conservative wizarding society does not like it. There is quite a bit of smut, but it is possible to skip past that if it is not your cup of tea. Don't be put off by the pairing(s), it even made me hit the back button for ages. Normally stories like this have the tendency to be spectacularily bad, but this one is not, I pinky-promise.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4267422]]

If you find that you absolutely cannot stand "Fate", consider the following alternatives:

Harry Potter and the conspiracy of blood by Cambangst

[[https://archiveofourown.org/users/cambangst/pseuds/cambangst]]

Harry is old enough to be a grandfather to grandkids of Hogwarts-age and he must lead 4 generations of Potters and Weasleys into a battle against an unknown enemy. Next gen with some Romione. Outstanding story, it is one of the few that can hold a candle to "Fate" in terms of complexity and general themes of love and family.

- The most powerful magic by cjr2

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2457953]]

After 20 years in coma Severus Snape wakes up. He finds himself taken in by the extended Potter-Malfoy family. Harry and Ginny have broken up and Ginny is now married to Draco Malfoy and expecting her fourth child. Severus' recovery is slow, but during the time his body heals he slowly falls in love with one Harry Potter.

The story explores the connection between magic and love or the question why there weren't other instances were the killing curse did not work bc somebody sacrificed themselves.

Next gen, slash (but no smut), little to no Romione.

** There is very little that I won't read or at least give a try.

But in general I avoid any stories where the (mostly) human characters of HP no longer act like normal humans and or are wildly OOC for no good reason. This generally includes:

- creature fics, bc in many cases HP fanfiction is just a convenient vehicle for some made-up creature with strange, non-human behaviour and no recogniseable connection to the HP characters. There are some creature fics I really like, but in general I find myself bored with the trope, especially if it is used to tie two characters together (romantically and or sexually) without taking their human side into account.

- harem fics, again bc most of the time normal people don't act like that

- marriage law fics. It an overused trope and in most cases there is not enough resistance from the people or oppression from the regime to make it believable to me. Add in the lack of canon support for such a society (especially post-Voldemort) and I much rather read something original along these lines than a HP fanfic.

- Voldemort and Death Eater fics just for the sake of shipping them / writing porn. I openly admit that I have been avoiding Again and Again for just this reason, despite knowing that it is good. I plan to read it - someday.

I tend to avoid het bc most of the time the authors don't put enough effort into writing the pairing. I like a slow burn and this is often not happening, where it is usually a given that just bc it is a man and a woman that mutual attraction is there. I can give this a pass with canon pairings (Harry/Ginny, Ron/Hermione), but if it is Snape/Hermione you better be really good at coming up with a scenario that works.

Finally, I vastly prefer finished over unfinished. If it is unfinished it better be really good and over 70k.
