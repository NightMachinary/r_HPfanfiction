Are there any fics where 2 people make a horcrux place it in each other? Like for instance Harry and Hermione jump off the deep end and Harry puts his Horcrux in Hermione and vice versa?


** Yes, in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5435295/1/The-Bonds-of-Blood][The Bonds of Blood]], linkffn(5435295), Harry and Ginny involuntarily became each other's horcrux, and the effects were NOT pleasant.

  You always get the stories where Harry goes back into Tom Riddle's time, then either stays or gets sent back. End of, unless he tries to make Voldemort good. But what if things went differently? What if, just once, someone followed a time traveller back?
