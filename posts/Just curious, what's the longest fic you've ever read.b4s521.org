I mean largest amount of chapters (I'm not quite thinking in word counts yet). How long, and was it worth it??

I once read a 160 chapter fic that was totally worth it.

For those who measure by words it was something like 1,166,000ish


** I've read a fair few fic that topped a million words, especially if you count series. Most of them were very much worth it.

The most memorable one was the one that was kind of terrible, though, and in retrospect I still can't believe I finished it. This was in the bad old days before AO3, or even FFN, so we were all a lot less picky, and it was a relatively small fandom. I wasn't going to pass on a million-word fic under those circumstances, no matter how iffy the quality. But I was kind of questioning all of my life choices by the time I got to the end.

I don't think chapters are a reliable method of measuring length, though. I've read at least one fic that was over 100 chapters and only about 40,000 words, and I've read fic that were technically 100,000+ word long one-shots.

** HP Single Fic: A Marauder's Plan. Almost 900K words for a single year. linkffn(8045114)

HP total in a series: I think the Danger series, starting with Living with Danger. linkffn(2109424). It's somewhere north of 1M words. If not that, than the Arithmancer Series, still going strong. linkffn(The Arithmancer)

Overall longest fic: Gladiator (ATLA) 1.9M words and counting

** Hmm I usually am wary of fics with too many chapters but a word count that doesn't follow.

For example the fic "Rebuilding" proposed by KalmiaJamui on this post is 300 chapters with a bit over 250k words which makes an average of maybe 900 words per chapters. Short chapters usually (not always) don't have enough "time" to tell a story and I think that maybe the author should have asked himself if he had to cut the chapter a this moment. Of course chapter with too many words may also be a hassle but it doesn't bother me too much.

To answer your question, I don't remember the chapter counts on fics very well as it doesn't mean anything to me so the longest fic I read (and that's if I don't forget another) was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9443327/1/A-Third-Path-to-the-Future][A Third Path to the Future]] with over 1.5M words (in 36 chapters, which makes an avg. of over 40k words per chapters... a bit much for a lot of people). It's a Marvel/HP crossover and I quite enjoy it (still ongoing).

*** Hi! The structure of Rebuilding with the very short chapters was a deliberate choice on my part. For approximately 9 months I uploaded a chapter every day. It was a web serial written for the enjoyment of myself and the people following it at the time, who frequently expressed how much they enjoyed the experience of knowing there would be a new ‘coffee break' sized chapter every day without fail. While I understand reading it as a unified story is frustrating (and you are certainly welcome to hate the structure), I wanted to push back against your suggestion the structure was an accident of incompetence or inexperience. It was not.

**** Ok thanks for the information, I'll try it when I'm done with the one I'm reading now.

As for the structure, I clearly don't hate it but when I found such fics it was often (and I'll repeat, not always) chapters with really little substance and it was hard to follow a story because of the lack of details and such. For me it worked better when it was for example a collection of little stories not always directly linked, from different PoV or with time jump in between. Maybe slice of life kind of events or random facts (comes to my mind the random facts that Taliesin19 (writer of "Grow Young With Me") puts on her blog in between updates). So yeah such structure isn't proof of incompetence/inexperience and I understand it's hard to write. Maybe I just didn't find the correct fics with this structure because, as I said, it was often lacking in details of substance.

Still, congrats on such a project which clearly can't be easy. Finding inspiration, motivation and time everyday to post a chapter. Nice statement also.

I honestly, though, can't in all fairness rec it in this sub. It's a romance/what are the limits of compassion/ptsd story and has about 0 overlap with this group's general interests. (Which is FINE.)

** I've conditioned myself to ignore stories whose chapter to text ratio is bad, at least when it's supposed to be a novel-length story and longer. That probably makes me miss certain gems, but to be honest there's enough variety in the HP fandom that keeps me entertained.

The longest I've read is likely in the 100 chapter range, but I remember stories a lot better by the total length in words, which is in the 750k-1m range. None of the 1m+ epics I found or started reading particularly appealed to me, so I never finished any.

The longest HP fanfics I've read are A Marauder's Plan by CatsAreCool, The Brave New World by bellerophon30, For Love of Magic by Noodlehammer and also the as of yet uncompleted The Legacy by storytellerSpW.
