I'm looking for a fic where the goblins are shown in a negative light. I don't feel like the goblin rebellions are mentioned enough in fan fiction when talking about the goblins.

I've already read The Sum of Their Parts btw.

** A Brand New Start, by Faewm (or Fairywm on FFnet). Harry has a series-long vendetta against the goblins and does a lot to thwart them. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15375369]])
