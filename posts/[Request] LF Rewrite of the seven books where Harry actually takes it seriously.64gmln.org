So i understand Ron not taking school seriously seeing as he is the youngest male of a long line of overachievers. What else can he bring to the table? I have seen this with some of my own friends where their older siblings overshadowed and so they underachieved. That's cool, I respect that.

But what I have never understood is how Harry, who is coming from an abusive environment, isn't more awed by the Wizarding world. If I was living in a cupboard for eleven years of my life and was told, not only are you /not/ a nobody, but you are the boy-who-lived and this is your true and natural "world," well I think I would take it a bit more seriously. He quickly slips into apathy and while I really love the Harry Potter series as a whole...I couldn't help but feel like screaming at Harry....When was he going to take it seriously? After meeting Voldemort at the end of the fourth book? No. After meeting him again at the end of the fifth book? No. After seeing Dumbledore die? Nope. And thus I watched him traipse about England with not a clue what to do only to stumble upon the last three horcruxes in a climactic ended that ended with expelliarmus. Seriously? /rant

Short of writing my own fic (which I have attempted...genuinely have a good idea, genuinely suck at writing) I was wondering...

What if Dumbledore met Harry at 11 and explained to him everything: the prophecy, Voldemort, suspicions of Horcruxes etc. or something (anything really...) along those lines which caused Harry to take his school seriously.

I don't necessarily care for an OP Harry Potter. We know the kid has talent--producing a patronus in the third year is no small feat. But then that hint at a powerful Harry disappears. So what if he actually applied himself and became believably powerful? I /really/ like H/G (as Ginny is one of my favorite characters), with H/DG coming in second place. Never cared much for H/Hr but I can tolerate it.

I've considered writing this very story myself but I wanted to see if there was something else out there.

::::EDIT::::

OK so it definitely seems like there is a shortage in this area but the debate that I have been reading in the comments is great. Whether or not Harry would ever be truly powerful enough to take Voldemort down, I think, comes down to personal interpretation.

My last caveat I will leave you with is this: Why introduce the Marauder's and their pranking/secret passageway discoveries (which was enticing to me) only to have Harry be the exact opposite? I get it, the Dursleys probably squashed that out but come on...nothing from Harry?

Second--why introduce things like wordless spell casting, home-made spells (snape, HBP), more efficient ways to make potions, etc. and never have Harry explore them? There was so much foreshadowing of these cool tricks and I was awaiting Harry's discovery and subsequent mastery of these subjects only to be let down. And I know the patronus is not a /great/ example of Harry's power but please...if the kid can do that in his third year why can he not master nonverbals?? No excuse there in my opinion.

My humble opinion...As the books evolved the surface area of the magical world increased (i.e. JKR mentioned new creatures, spells, classes, characters etc.) but with an increase in surface area comes an exponential increase in volume. I think to some degree, and it's why I love fan fiction, it's up to fanfiction to explore the depths of which JKR only scratched the surface.


** The thing is, any reasonable interpretation of Harry's natural talents still leaves the problem that Voldemort (who, alas, is not a Dementor and is therefore profoundly unimpressed by Harry's Patronus) is vastly more talented a wizard, has many decades' head start, and can be brought back from the dead as long as he has followers.

Without Sacrificial Protection and Wandlore shenanigans, a Harry who doesn't take "it" seriously lasts for 2 minutes against Voldemort, then dies. However, a Harry who /does/ take "it" seriously lasts for 4 minutes against Volemort, then still dies. With Sacrificial Protection and/or Wandlore, how seriously Harry takes "it" doesn't make a positive difference; possibly the opposite, in fact.

Taking "it" seriously would be pursuit of Power That Voldemort Knows Very Well, so it wouldn't help that much, and, in fact, it would have opportunity costs in areas like love and friendship, which do, in fact, cultivate Power that Voldemort Knows Not. Therefore, it would probably make Harry /less/ effective against Voldemort, and it was actually quite rational for Dumbledore /and/ for Harry to just try to provide/have as normal a childhood and adolescence as could be managed under the circumstances.

#+end_quote

I disagree.

I see The Power Voldemort Knows Not as not love, but self-sacrifice. In Lily's case, and later in Harry's case, love was where they found the courage to be self-sacrificing. Harry beats Voldemort because he is capable of self-sacrifice, which he /needs/ to be, because Voldemort's only true weakness is his Horcruxes, and Harry is a Horcrux. You can't love away the Horcrux, but you can definitely destroy it.

Voldemort /cannot/ be self-sacrificing. He cannot love others because he only loves himself, which means that he has no reason to sacrifice anything of himself if he does not get anything in return. That's still A Power He Knows Not.

Harry taking his role seriously would mean internalization of his duty, and duty is just as much a powerful motivator for self-sacrifice as love is. That's what he needs to be, more than anything, since Harry himself /has/ to die in order for Voldemort to die. As long as he gets to that point, it's worthwhile.

**** Replace love with duty? An interesting idea. However, duty is not an ultimate cause of action the way love is: love requires no cause, but a sense of duty must generally be backed by a value like love.

Self-imposed duty for its own sake gives you broken people like Javert in /Les Miserables/; it's little better than a habit or an addiction. Externally imposed duty --- if internalized --- is little better than the Imperius or other forms of brainwashing. I suspect that sacrificial magic wouldn't take in either case.

In any case, Dumbledore seems to think that the power in question is love; he says as much in both OotP and HBP. Since his ultimate plan to slay Voldemort while saving Harry worked out, I am inclined to believe him.

Dumbledore set up resources and contingencies to guide Harry in a particular way, even if the details might not have been planned out in advance and some elements were, indeed, a proverbial Hail Mary pass; but Potterverse is not an indifferent universe, so the Hail Marys may have been justified.

In any case, "author fiat" an accurate explanation of what happened, but it's not a helpful one, since it is an equally accurate explanation for every possible outcome and therefore ultimately explains nothing and has no predictive power.

******* Even with the Sacrificial Protection and Wand Shenanigan, Harry's win was mostly based on "A Series of Very Lucky Events".

Beginning with them stopping saying "Voldemort" on the run, to that lucky escape from Malfoy Manor, to that wrestling wands from Draco, to them getting Snape's memory, to Voldemort not using alternative means to kill Harry....

Just too many to count.

Harry was essentially a "Hollywood styled extremely lucky hero with some willpowers", and that came on top of author's plot devices.

******** I'd have used that fucking taboo to draw off as many of Voldemort's forces as possible before the final fight (just apparate around the country, say the name and disapparate to another location etc. etc. - you need 2-5 guys to do this and to send the dark-forces on a wild goose chase, thus increasing the chances of the good guys)

Otherwise I agree - Harry's "success" (blundering his way to a win more likely - which only worked because Dumbledore, who practically is omniscient despite being an abusive asshole (he's complicit in the Dursleys child-abuse...yes, hitting people with frying pans, setting dogs on them and watching while others beat them up is abuse, same for not feeding them and locking them in cupboards and/or rooms!), set it up beforehand!)

Harry himself nearly ruined the good guys in book 7 - hell, Hermione was more prepared than he was and she was even willing to memory-charm her parents for fuck's sake...the book should be named: Hermione Granger and the Deathly Hollows!

IMHO JK did everything she could in that book to destroy her "hero" (I know, he always wanted to be "Just Harry", but you don't always get what you fucking want...I want to be a damned rich guy with not a care in the world, but I am fucking NOT! He should have gotten his act together at the very latest after book 2....)

***** For some people, the need to be useful and productive is extremely strong, so much so that they feel a need to do important tasks simply because they need doing. In the case of Harry spending his adolescence preparing to fight Voldemort, it may be that his sense of duty comes from some kind of basic humanitarian value, but ultimately it would be driven by a need to be fulfilling a purpose.

Hell, let's consider that you don't consider that kind of drive to be the source of motivation (I think this is simplifying humanity a bit, but either way). That story can still exist, and Harry grappling with /why/ he's trying so hard, when he himself doesn't have a nice, clean explanation for it, can be a major turning point in his development. Where that goes would probably be a reflection of what the author believes would drive a person, but up to that point, his desire is still valid enough to him to drive him.

I'm skeptical that Harry protected the fighters at Hogwarts through love. Harry can't /possibly/ love all those people, especially not as deeply as Lily loved him. Even putting aside how there's never been a moment to establish how he might feel that way towards the individuals, it's not within normal human limits to feel that strongly towards so many people. Still, his sacrifice offered them protection.

He also doesn't need the power of love to survive the encounter, because Voldemort /can't/ kill him that easily. It's not his doing that saved him, but Lily's. Doesn't matter why he went out to face Voldemort, because that protection is still in effect.

****** I'm pretty sure that Lily's protection was somewhat dulled when Voldemort used Harry's blood in his resurrection and expired completely when he turned 17. So, when he went to Voldemort at the end of DH, he did not have it protecting him.

I take your point about Harry's love at the end of DH --- if Harry were doing it out of pure utilitarianism (i.e., "more people will die if I don't let Voldemort kill me than if I do, therefore I will let him kill me"), it might have taken as well. But even there, there's a value underlying the duty.

However, Sacrificial Protection is only one of the ways in which Love protects; for example, there is also Voldemort ultimately not being able to touch Harry's mind through their link, despite Harry being poor at Occlumency. I don't think a sense of duty could replace that.

******* I know I'm coming in late, but I had an idea (perhaps headcanon, though I can't think of another explanation). I've always been of the opinion that Harry survived Voldemort's first killing curse because of /Snape/.

Snape asked Voldemort to spare Lily.

Voldemort offers to let Lily live if she abandons Harry.

Lily pleads to take her instead.

Voldemort (attempts) to kill them both.

There are a lot of conflicting variables in that kind of situation and in a world where you can apparently be binded into oaths and contracts without your consent, it's always been my opinion that Voldemort somehow /accidentally/ agreed to kill Lily if he would spare Harry. When he broke that "contract" by attempting to kill Harry immediately afterward, his magic backfired on him.

Think about it - how many mothers must have pleaded to spare their children during a /war/? This seems like the only logical reason that Harry should have survived, and it all starts with Snape.

Funnily enough, when I was reading 0800 Rent-a-Hero, I had thoughts along those exact same lines; alternate-reality Dumbledore and crew buggered up because the Harry they summoned literally can't use the 'power he knows not', that being self-sacrifice, because he has no connection with the world he's been summoned to and they treat him as an outsider (nothing to love, nothing to willfully sacrifice for). Or something, it's been a while since I read it.

No, but really, if you tear your soul into pieces, I think that's self sacrificing. Can't get any more sacrificial than tearing a soul apart in order to save a life. Even if it were the owner of the soul doing it, to save his own life.

I don't think Tom loved himself. He was incapable of love, and that included loving himself. I don't quite know what it is to love oneself, but I guarantee you he didn't either. He hated both his parents, and they created him. He hated them because they made him what he was.

**** Going by Word of God, Voldemort wouldn't be able to cast a Patronus, because Dark Wizards can't cast it. (Snape, apparently, is insufficiently Dark.) My sense of his character is that he would scoff at a Patronus, dismissing it as a useless spell for those too weak and scared to seek real power. (Voldemort's preferred way of dealing with Dementors is probably to bargain with them by offering them more victims.)

A lot of Charms require a specific emotional state from the caster, and for some of them, it's positive states. (Cheering Charm is an example, IIRC.) On the other hand, as far as I know, it's not restricted to non-Dark Wizards.

That could actually make for an interesting twist in a Gray!Harry fic: he's going all Gray and Edgy and Hard Man Making Hard Decisions, and everything is going well (for him, and the small set of people he cares about and who are coincidentally people who agree with him on everything). But then, he finds himself facing Dementors. He summons the first happy memory that comes to mind (a triumph over some enemy), pronounces the incantation, and nothing happens. He tries again, with memories that had worked before, and he doesn't get anything either. He realizes that he's gone too far down the Dark path.

A this point, it could either be a tragic ending in which he is consumed by the Dementors, or something could save him, setting him on a path to redemption.

  ...the Patronus is not unknown among Dark wizards. While there is a widespread and justified belief that a wizard who is not pure of heart cannot produce a successful Patronus (the most famous example of the spell backfiring is that of the Dark wizard Raczidian, who was devoured by maggots), a rare few witches and wizards of questionable morals have succeeded in producing the Charm (Dolores Umbridge, for example, is able to conjure a cat Patronus to protect herself from Dementors). It may be that a true and confident belief in the rightness of one's actions can supply the necessary happiness. However, most such men and women, who become desensitised to the effects of the Dark creatures with whom they may ally themselves, regard the Patronus as an unnecessary spell to have in their arsenal.

Well, Harry's not a psychopath (in the clinical sense of the word), and he isn't a prodigy (since we --- and other characters --- would have noticed if he were).

Harry attends all his classes and does all his assigned homework. He likes quiddich and he likes being admired for his quiddich skills --- as opposed to being admired for things he is forced into, like Boy-Who-Lived-related aspects of his life. That he doesn't pursue magic over and above the curriculum unless motivated by external circumstances doesn't make him lazy or an underachiever but rather a typical human being.

That Harry's vaunted leadership skills aren't all they're cracked up to be is something we agree on; but again, it's a separate issue from magical skill.

This makes it sound like there were two or three writers involved in Harry Potter's character, one who designed him to be a prodigy and to win by overcoming Voldemort with prodigious talent, and others who proceeded to sabotage him into something less. However, all of the books were written by one person, J.K. Rowling, at least as far as the world knows.

I don't want to go personal, and I certainly don't want to insult you or hurt anyone, but I beg you to at least consider what I am about to write seriously.

I think that you may have, through a mix of fanfic and wishful thinking, created a mental image of Harry-as-prodigy that feels like canon to you. You are then finding the abilities and actions of canon!Harry to be disappointing relative to your mental image of him.

****** This is rehashing our thread a few months ago. I recommend rereading the books: Harry constantly describes himself in class, studying, and doing homework, being busy and even overloaded with schoolwork. He occasionally mentions Hermione's help explicitly. That he gets above-average OWL results after attending all the classes and doing all the homework is a sign of an above-average talent, not a prodigious one.

#+begin_quote

Yes, Dark Arts seem to come more easily to him; but notice that we don't actually know how easily they come to others. It's a common trope that evil magic is easier to do than non-evil magic. Consider /Star Wars/:

*Luke:* Is the dark side stronger?

*Yoda:* No, no, no. Quicker, easier, more seductive.

Something similar seems to be the case with Dark Arts in Potterverse.

Plenty of wizard-raised got lower marks; and Ron, in particular didn't know a real spell from a fake one when he showed up at Hogwarts, so everyone was starting from about the same place. Being wizard-raised isn't a big advantage.

One thing I found when searching for instances of the word "essay" in the books just now is that Harry is actually a more diligent student than Ron, in that he often has his essays finished first and lets Ron copy. So, if Harry's a prodigy for getting Es on his OWLs, Ron's an even bigger one.

Whatever. The point is that if Rowling didn't write Harry doing prodigy things when you feel that she should have, it's not because she sabotaged him, but because he actually wasn't the prodigy you feel that he should have been, because it's up to Rowling to decide what canon Harry's talents are, not you or me.

That's a very poor analogy; Harry's an adult, known to the public to be good at DADA, and most people wouldn't know about the "gun", but, if we abuse the analogy further, observed him taking down a martial arts champion with one punch.

It's not that she beat Bellatrix. (That isn't what I actually wrote, by the way; remember what they say about assuming?) It's /how/ she and Bellatrix fought: an exchange of nonverbally cast spells so rapid and intense, it damages the environment around them, ending when one of the combatants is momentarily distracted. Harry just doesn't show that level of skill in any of his fights.

That's not really a strike against Harry, though: Molly has been in the Order for two decades, and Harry hadn't started his Auror training at that point. By the time he finishes that, he might well be better than Molly.

Aurors had lost him as well, in that he had to become Minister of Magic. The point is that they lost a lot of good people, so a lot of recruits were going to be promoted very quickly. Aurors that survived the war probably got battlefield promotions as well, because that's the sort of thing that happens in war. Again, not a strike against Harry, but not evidence of prodigy either.

If I was living in a cupboard for eleven years of my life and was told, not only are you not a nobody, but you are the boy-who-lived and this is your true and natural "world," well I think I would take it a bit more seriously. He quickly slips into apathy and while I really love the Harry Potter series as a whole...I couldn't help but feel like screaming at Harry....When was he going to take it seriously? After meeting Voldemort at the end of the fourth book? No. After meeting him again at the end of the fifth book? No. After seeing Dumbledore die? Nope. And thus I watched him traipse about England with not a clue what to do only to stumble upon the last three horcruxes in a climactic ended that ended with expelliarmus. Seriously? /rant
#+end_quote

That was the primary reason why Harry is NOT my favorite character in the Series, despite him having many virtues.

The way he won in the end can be summarized as "a cliched Hollywood hero who stumbled to victory due to insane amount of luck and some willpower". His archenemy being a cartoonish monolithically evil villain with strong compulsive-obsessive behaviors certainly helped.

Personally, I'm fed up with the 'lucky hero' trope. I want to see more heroes winning through cunning, intelligence, resourcefulness, and strategies. Therefore, I enjoyed [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] significantly more than the Canon Series. That Harry, though not OP, was in author's own words "an extremely dangerous young man".

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

From the bio page for Mira Mirth on ffnet:

#+begin_quote
  Summer 2016: No, seriously, when I said "whenever you read this profile, just assume the fic is not abandoned," I meant it. I realize it's hard to assume the story is still ongoing if it's been like months and months and months between updates, but that's just the way things work if you've accidentally found yourself writing an epic I love this 'verse, though, obviously, sometimes other things take priority over me working on it. Like RL. And other fictional interests, which happen also. But the bottom line is, this story is dear to my heart and I'm not likely to declare it abandoned any time in the foreseeable future.

*** What does it matter if it's abandoned or not. OtWtG is the best model of what could be considered as Harry taking his schooling seriously. You could make the argument that he's forced into it due to the nature of him being sorted into Slytherin, but nevertheless the story executed that rather brilliantly and is perhaps the best piece of hp fanfiction I've come across in over five years.

And it's not even like it's short either. 20 chapters and 200k+ words.

*** I started reading this and lost interest but I can't remember why. I tend to shy away from incomplete works because my very first fanfiction, and one of my very favorites was/is NIghtmares of Futures Past. Now I know it is very seriously /not/ abandoned and that the author had some sort of accident and is only just getting back into it....but I was loving that story and blowing through chapters only to realize it was incomplete with little to no hope of being finished. What a let down (but i am excited to know it may not be abandoned)....either way I need to finish this story as I liked what I had read.
