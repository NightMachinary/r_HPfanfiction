Harry learns about the time turner and immediately breaks it to go back farther then 24 hours.

The night his parents died. Harry, under his invisibility cloak, grabs a knife from his parents house and is ready and waiting near the doorway. When Voldemort busts in the knife is ran through his neck. Harry repeatedly stabs him, years of hatred and suffering just going off like an atom bomb.

Voldemort lay dead on the ground, Lily and James look at the boy and see he looks like their baby. "Hey Mom. Hey dad."

Just then Sirius Black appears and is told what happened along with Harry explaining what happened.

Then Hagrid appears and says "Dumbledore sent me to get Harry and bring him somewhere."

Lily's eyes narrow and she hands the baby to James "If this child leaves this house before I get back I'm neutering both you and the mutt."

When lily and Hagrid arrive at Privot drive Dumbledore and Minerva are shocked their alive. Minerva rushes to hug Lily, thankful she's not dead, but the muggleborn has her wand leveled at Dumbledore. "Wanna explain why your lacky came to my house planning on bringing my baby to my bitch of a sister house?"

Albus keeps a neutral look and explains how Harry would be safe growing up with his family. "I am his family. James is his family. Sirius is his family. That cunt isn't family!" Lily shouted pointing to the normal house.

Albus tries to convince Lily but it takes her threatening to leave the country for him to back off.


** If both James and Lily survive, there's no blood protection, thus no need for Harry to be placed with the child abusers.

And if Albus tries anyway then he's the Evil!Dumbles version and all his plans against Harry are going to fail anyway.

** That trick wouldn't have worked if Voldemort had charmed his clothes with Protego, such as what the Twins sold in HBP.

Given Voldemort's paranoid nature and his abilities, he would have more sophisticated protections for himself than what the Twins could offer.

No, if Harry ever decided to prevent the Halloween Tragedy, he would need something much more sophisticated.

*** Yup. Way too easy and reeks too much of the manipulative bashing Super!Harry troupes that we all know and hate.

If he did manage to find a way to break the time turner and go back in time, it would be smarter to just take down Peter. Way easier to do that than go after Voldemort during his prime.

***** Objection, the house elves and centaurs turn the battle of Hogwarts armed like a 13th-century peasant mob. If the shield charm was such simple fix, two death eaters quickly cast it, throw a few blasting curses into the incoming horde and resume the regular battle.

****** Objection to your objection, the shield charm is said to be hard to cast for even Aurors, and given that most Death Eaters are nowhere near Auror level, there was a very good chance no one but the inner circle could cast one.

Also, as a rule of thumb, don't apply logic to stories - if the Death Eaters could cast the shield charm to stop house elves Voldemort would have just kept spamming extremely overpowered blasting curses from the Elder Wand at Hogwarts and the battle would have been over in seconds

Not for Aurors, for the average Ministry clerk. Otherwise, they'd be even more garbage if they are easily outdone by a bunch of students.

No, he was braindead when it comes to tactics. An uphill frontal assault on a fortified hilltop across a few hundred yards of open ground is just suicide. If the defenders had more than 3 braincells, Voldemort would have experienced why WWI was so bloody as he threw his entire forces away within minutes. The mandrakes alone should have killed a decisive amount of Death Eaters within seconds. And that's not even assuming the movie chokepoints.

**** Absolutely, or else you are really nerfing the magic in HP too much.

Also, the strength of Protego should depend on casters.

For example, those lowly Ministry minions would have trouble stopping a 10/22 round, while Harry at age 17 can stop multiple assault rifle shots. I imagine Voldemort's Protego could stop machine gun bullets indefinitely.

***** Eh, that's not how protego hats worked.

And I would think Voldemort would be more resistant due to the Horcruxes.

Maybe if the knife had Basilisk poison.

EDIT: I am pretty sure wizards can charm their clothes to be knife proof, but I don't think Voldemort would apply those though, he would never imagine wizards would try to go for melee attacks(which means a decent Paladin could thrash him)

****** I remember one fic where "the power the dark lord knows not" was a gun. So um... Harry just pops up one day with a gun and shoots Voldemort straight in the face. And that actually worked lol. Pretty straight forward really.

Although I'd find it hard to believe that Tom Riddle, who lived through WW2, wouldn't think of muggle weapons. Or at the very least he'd protect himself against them in case a muggleborn or half blood tried using muggle weapons (I mean c'mon, there were two really long wars fought over him, /someone/ had to have tried it at least once).
