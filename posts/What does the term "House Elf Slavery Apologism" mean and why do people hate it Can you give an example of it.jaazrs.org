** There are some good explanations of what it is, so I'll add to why authors use it. The issue is that if you want a morally upstanding protagonist, you kind of have to address House Elves. Also a lot of people love Dobby, so they need to get him involved. So if you have a good protagonist and Dobby, how do you reconcile letting slavery persist? And at the same time, it's really tough to write a compelling house elf revolution story, so authors just take the Hogwarts house elves as evidence that it isn't really slavery, so they don't have to muddle into the quagmire that appropriately addressing the issue would entail.

At least that's the most positive spin on it. The other side of the coin is Hermione bashing fics that have her support SPEW, ergo she must be wrong and stupid so house elf slavery is justified so Lord Hadrian Potter-Black can continue his anti-Hermione crusade.

** "House Elf Slavery Apologism" is the fanfic author's tendency to take JKR's justifications for slavery from the books at face value. They argue that, because it's a fantasy story, it's magically imperative for them to be slaves because that's just how house elves are built. They uphold the status quo of slavery because they either don't question it or don't feel like addressing it. Essentially, these are the people who ascribe to Ron's stance on house elves from the books.

People hate it because this depiction doesn't exist in a vacuum. There are very clear parallels to draw to actual, real-world slavery. Dobby is clearly abused by his master and desires freedom. Winky is framed for a crime she didn't commit and falls into a terrible depression. Kreacher is resentful of Sirius and betrays him on purpose, but later is able to change his loyalties. Tom Riddle frames Hepzibah Smith's house elf for her murder. In the Crimes of Grindelwald movie, there's a lady who is half house elf, meaning they were either forcefully cross-bred or have the ability to choose their own romantic partners. This all implies that house elves are sentient, able to think for themselves. They have powerful magic exceeding many wizard's abilities (Dobby being able to stand up against Lucius, their ability to apparate in Hogwarts), and yet are entirely subservient to wizards. Despite all that, they are portrayed as happy to be enslaved, as long as they aren't abused, although /nearly every single depiction of a master/house elf relationship in canon is exploitative or abusive/.

House elves are portrayed as poorly educated workhorses who live to take orders and are unable to function as normal & equal members of society because of "biology" despite the fact that they demonstrate critical sentient thought patterns & abilities. This way of thinking is exactly how real world racists thought of slaves, which is why a lot of people have a problem with this portrayal. Intentional or not-- it draws a lot of really uncomfortable parallels.

** Because at the end of the day House Elves are intelligent sentient beings, and Rowling made a world where they 'have' to be enslaved for their own good (magic bonds or something) and its basically a slaver or slavery apologists wet dream to be able to argue in favor of that, and follows some pretty 18th and 19yh century attitudes about slavery 'being for the good of the slaves who can't look after themselves' or some other tripe. Normally this when people would point out that Rowling tries to show this as wrong with how abused dobby is. But Rowling also said that all muggleborns had to have witch of wizard ancestry for their magic, and that's in a story with blood supremacist nazis, so Rowling's 'real' intentions for anything are pretty suspect.

*** Rowling did not make a world where they have to be slaves due to magical bonds or anything else. Unless she did subsequently on Pottermore or something, in which case to hell with her, but she didn't in the books. The first elf we see is Dobby, who is freed and better off for it. As far as I know, house elves needing to be slaves is pure "fanon", and should not be blamed on Rowling.

There's a lot I could say criticizing Rowling, but this is honestly a misrepresentation of her views and words bordering on defamatory.

Other than this, though, you are completely correct.

** There's a bit of a conundrum here for a fanfiction writers.

1. Slavery is abhorrent. (I don't think anyone will argue this one...)

2. Most readers prefer a morally upstanding protagonist and most writers depict theirs as such.

3. It is the moral imperative of any upstanding person to help abolish slavery.

4. Therefore a good protagonist with a smidgen of power or influence should work toward freeing the elves.

But myself, and many other readers, have no interest in yet another story where the good guys eradicate the purebloods and usher in a wonderful new era of acceptance. It's been done to death and too many of those read like a right-all-the-wrongs laundry list. I want magic and adventure and spicy relationships rather than bloody revolution (hi Starfox) or Wizengamot politics.

That's why writers invent various justifications for the position of house elves. They don't think that slavery is OK - they just don't want to deal with that can of worms in their story.

**** Because unless they're changing the setting in a major way, most people prefer to stick to canon as much as possible, and just fill in the gaps. It's pretty clear that house elves are magically enslaved in canon, and are forced to obey commands given to them (at least to the letter). Sure you could say house elves are now voluntary servants, but now if you're planning on sticking with the pillars of canon, which most writers do, you've created plot holes with why Dobby can't just explain things properly, or just leave, and why Kreacher doesn't immediately abandon Sirius for the Malfoys.

Because this isn't the kind of thing you can solve in a single chapter, at least not without it being incredibly contrived. So the plot thread is ignored for the same reason SPEW dies off in canon, it's not the focus of the story. There's only so much you can focus on, and 99% of stories aren't written about House Elf Liberation, the author doesn't want to take the spotlight away from the main plot in order to the the sideplot the level of attention required for it to be done well, so they just ignore it.

"eradicating" them would be genocide, which is most definitely not the action of a good guy, and also not necessary for or relevant to abolishing slavery.

** Most depictions of house elves tend to fall into either the "brainwashed slaves" or "would die without wizard magic" categories with the latter often being considered house elf slavery apologism.

Personally I'd be interested in something going back to the roots of house elves (brownies or other kinds) and treating them as fae. It was dangerous to anger a house elf and an insult to give them clothes. Angry brownies were similar to poltergeists see [[https://owlcation.com/humanities/When-Brownies-Turn-Bad][here]]. You could pull goblins and boggarts in too with the usual fae rules iron hurts them, don't eat their food, etc.

I've seen all sorts of crazy changes to canon, but I've never seen a fic where house elves aren't enslaved in some way or another. Give me house elves that spoil people's milk or make all your socks unravel when angered. They don't need to be all powerful since that could lead to deus ex elf issues, but I still feel like it could be a really fun element to mess with especially considering how much lore there is for "house elves" in Celtic and German folklore.

**** In some of the Brownie myths, they are bound to certain families. And some of their "rules" are pretty similar to the house elves. If you give them clothing, they leave, if you say thanks, or otherwise acknowledge them doing good work, they leave & may get destructive. (I guess Jk turned their freak outs internal, instead of them attacking people.) There's a myth where a Brownies family accidentally left them behind when they emigrated, & the Brownie was dying/fading away because of it. Her version seems pretty much in line with the lore, except for the self-flagellation.

"Complicated" implies acknowledging that simply giving all elves clothes is not a solution - but also admitting that there is a problem, and trying to do something about it . I've yet to see a fic that does that.

And worst is she could still have put all that aside at the end of year 6 by saying Voldemort got wise to their power and is now taking precautions, just to avoid copouts like sending elves to steal everything.

** I think actual House Elf Slavery Apologism is when House Elves are deliberately treated as analogues of human slavery by authors or those discussing the issue. And they they say that the slavery of house elves is okay because they want it/because of a magical binding or whatever. By doing so, they're saying that human slaves wanted it/needed it as well because house elves are representations of human slavery in the real world.

An example might be an author saying that "it's better for the house elves to work" and then make direct comparisons to actual slaves in history. Which is pretty disgusting and something I've seen before, to my general disappointment in humanity.

House Elf Slavery Apologism is also used to refer to those who don't see House Elves as analogues of human slavery in canon.

An example might be someone saying that house elves are based on Brownies and a different species, so they cannot be compared to human analogues. They might then be said to be slavery apologists because they're excusing away human slavery in history by refusing to engage with their literary analogues. Personally, I think this is a bit foolish as a better analogue for ethical comparison would be the treatment of working animals (different species and all).

** It really depends on what the source of the house elf race is. Also if they're getting something from the relationship they have with wizards. Obviously even if they do, abuse like Dobby endured should be stopped.

In my crossover fic, House elves are descended from Grell, creatures that live to cause trouble/chaos. Basically, these little critters breed fast and got their joy from setting fires/explosions/causing panic/mayhem and the wizards, especially after the Statue of Secrecy was imposed, had the choice of either wiping them out, or forcibly changing them to something new. (You know those myths of gremlins sabotaging things just to see them crash and burn? Yeah...) Because the deaths were piling up. But where the old creatures needed 'chaos' the new ones can survive as long as they have a task to do.

Lots of fics have the house elves as descendents of evil convicts or the forces of chaos. I see a comment from rek-lama that says slavery is abhorrent, but it's really cruelty that's abhorrent. The problem is that one tends to follow the other. It's hard to imagine a character like Harry, Hermione, or Ron causing suffering like Malfoy would.

But really, the house elf debate just really doesn't have enough information, like a lot of cannon. If the elves were torn from their homes and beaten until they agreed to serve their masters, then the wizards are evil for doing it, and continuing the tradition. If the elves are a creature that would destroy and ramapage if they were free, or if the relationship with wizards provides something they need, whether magic or /purpose/, then the muggleborn that campaign for their freedom are at fault. (Or the schooling for not giving them the proper context.)
