Like he holds a bit of a grudge against the other Gryffindors after they shunned him for the Dargon incident in the first year. Or became gruff and mean towards the other students in his second year. I don't really want him to play pranks on those who wronged him(only if it means their social stand will suffer from it) because it should show he is not his father. I want a Harry who just shows everyone there will be consequences of their actions against him. Especially if it's about death eaters. I want them to suffer!


** I seem to recall that Harry not only does not forgive, but he does not forget in "A Cadmean Victory." I also seem to recall it being pretty garbo. Unfortunately, most revenge or ruthless Harry fics tend to be not great.

I didn't love "The Sum of Their Parts," but it is a solid fic if you somehow haven't run into it yet. Good luck with your search!

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

*** Cadmean Victory had a really enjoyable relationship and banter between Harry and Salazar, I think that's its main strength even if others have a lot of issues with the rest of it.
