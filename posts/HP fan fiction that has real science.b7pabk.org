*** If anybody reads this please don't take the science at face value. There are some egregious errors closely linked with racial pseudoscience. I don't know anything about the author so I won't make any claims about what they were thinking, but imo their disclaimer that they are intentionally including mistakes is irresponsible especially given how the story has acted as an entry point for many people.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
