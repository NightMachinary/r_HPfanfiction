*** Nah. No soul bonding. No lordship stuff as for as I remember. No Death angel. The two come back. Kill plenty DEs in Azkaban. Perhaps others. Luna was found locked in a cupboard or something and joins as a lover. But they don't tell her about their other activities atleast in the begining.

**** Ah, okay. I just vaguely remember that in Death's Pride Luna gets locked in a closet or something and needs to be saved. It's been years since I read it.
