Wizarding money at least to me is incredibly confusing. How do you guys tend to use the money?

What would be poor enough for the Weasley's to make it believable, rich enough for the Malfoy's and somewhere in between for Harry to live comfortably enough so people aren't saying stuff like that is way too much money for him.

How do you guys arrange the money for it to make more sense? Thoughts?


** A few thoughts:

- The wizarding economy is small in absolute terms due to the low population.

- The wizarding economy does not have a banking sector in the sense of banks which create money as Muggle banks do, nor a central bank which prints money. The money supply is therefore extremely stable, meaning there will not be a trend of inflation as in the Muggle world.

- The wizarding economy appears to still be on the gold standard.

- The wizarding economy does not have mass production and is not inclined towards it, given that you cannot automate the enchantment of objects.

All these add up to a very stable economy with almost zero inflation and low growth, and a moderately fixed money supply, as well as no "wealth creators" of the kind who in the Muggle world create billions worth of economic value where before there was nothing.

In short, the wizarding economy does not have the capacity for billionaires. What extremely wealthy individuals it does possess will likely have their wealth tied up in illiquid assets like land.

On the other hand, wizards can use magic to satisfy many of their basic needs for themselves. They have no gas or electric bills, no internet or phone bills, potentially no water bills. Many of them inherit homes so they would have no rent or need to buy a house. In short the main expense on necessities for most wizards would be food. Most everything else is a relative luxury. That means the majority of their wages will constitute disposable income. This allows wages to be quite low, relative to the Muggle world, while still allowing wizards a high standard of living.

As a guess, therefore

*Weasleys:*

Land: 40,000 Galleons

Cash: 0

Income: 5,000 Galleons/year

*Harry (age 16, post OotP):*

Land: 120,000 Galleons

Cash: 100,000 Galleons

Income: 0/year

*Lucius Malfoy:*

Land: 20,000,000 Galleons

Cash: 500,000 Galleons

Income: 50,000 Galleons/year

** A lot of handwaving and justifications. £5 to the galleon and there's indication in Quidditch Through the Ages that inflation exists iirc. Conjuring changes some prices, hence Harry's blowout at the sweets trolley being so cheap (even at 1991 prices).

Clothes are clearly expensive. Wands are not. Ollivander is somehow succeeding on a tiny, tiny amount of money while still renting an exclusive shop front /and/ he has competitors in Britain - one nearby and one in Hogsmeade. If people typically buy one or perhaps two wands and Hogwarts /does/ hold a thousand students, and not the 280 that might be indicated, and half of them get educated outside of Hogwarts, then he's still barely making enough to rent a tent.

I end up with low wages of around 100G a month, £500 a month, or £6000 a year - enough to survive. I start my lowest Ministry workers on this. Canonically a senior auror gets 1000G a month, that's around £60 000 a year at 1991 prices, pretty impressive. It's clearly a prestigious position.

Getting school robes etc works out in my head at about 75G and I give Harry a vault with 10 000 G, which is /enormous/ until you try to weild it for power. Absolutely pitiful for a full inheritence from a stinking rich family. Black's fortune is about 150 000G, Malfoy's slightly higher.

1000G didn't rent the Weasley twins their shop: they used it to buy raw material and built up from there by owl order. Except I never see how there are enough customers, or how the country isn't pranked sideways.

Malfoy invests in businesses. It's not even so much that he bribes Fudge (he does), as that he represents a fair chunk of wizarding jobs and businesses.

The Weasleys would be doing fine, but they spend money as soon as they get it and Molly is too lazy (or chronically ill and hiding it well) to actually work, even when all her kids are at school. She has a life she likes and no ambition whatsoever. Her kids, especially Ron, are left hanging. Their 'poverty' is largely self-imposed. School fees aren't an issue, a great many books can be handed down and wands are staggeringly cheap for a lifetime purchase. They go on holidays and to Quidditch matches and throw away a lot of leftover food and then wonder where it all went. Arthur is probably not at the lowest end of the scale (100G pm) if he's competent enough to be heading his own office by 1996 and to be pushing a law through in 1991. If he's pulling in even 400G pm and living on his own land, they should be pretty comfortable, especially given they may well know how to make a lot of food from a little (Ron mentions the fact that you can, as if it's well known and something he grew up with).

Lots of it won't make sense and I get some fun from imagining scenarios where it does, but those are the figures I ended up with.

*** The Weasleys are shown to use other family members' wands until they reach a certain age/graduate. (Ron got Charlie's wand, and I have my own headcanon that the Twin's wands originally belonged to the Prewett Twins.)

** I think people mostly tend to overcomplicate it, and apply muggle economic situations to the wizarding world, which should be completely different and mostly separate.

Some assumptions have to be made, such as there being some sort of mechanic to whereas wizards aren't just gaming the system by selling gold galleons in the muggle world (because clearly, indy!Harry is the first to ever come up with that idea).

Then, you have to wonder what exactly the buying power is of a galleon, and what exactly they're buying. Like, for all we know, Arthur Weasley makes decent money as a department head, except what is decent money for a guy and his wife might be woefully inadequate for a family with 7 children.

Lastly, you have to reconcile the fact that all because someone has a wand and magic doesn't mean they can literally do everything with it. Like, transfiguring your clothes every day, and living in a conjured/expanded hut, and creating infinite potions and living off whatever method you think is remotely plausible for near-infinite food... sure you can probably write that, it just won't be interesting. It's a lot for one person to do and maintain.

** My headcanon on exchange rates: 1 galleon ~= 5 pounds, 1 sickle ~= 6 shillings, 1 knut ~= 2.5 pence. That's in pre-1970 money, obviously.\\
(If the 17 and 29 figures are rounded - not sure if they're ever implied to be exact - those conversions might actually be exact ones instead; the rates come out to 16.67 and 28.8 respectively.)\\
(Actually, letting 1 sickle = 6 shillings = 30 new pence, and assuming the 17 and 29 to be exact, gives a decent approximation for the canon galleon rate, which is a bit off from exactly 5 pounds; but, IIRC, 1 knut = 2.5 old pence is even closer.)

A related part of my headcanon (which I sniped from an old fic, but I forgot which one) is that Gringotts just didn't bother to change the Muggle currency exchange rates since the early 20th century (or even the 19th century), especially since before that it tended to be fairly stable anyway.\\
Back then, it made sense to have a five-sovereign gold galleon, three-florin silver sickle, or ten-farthing copper knut (IIRC, they actually end up roughly the same size that way - a little larger than an Eisenhower dollar; nowhere near hubcaps, obviously, but still huge to an unprepared 1990s Muggle).

I like this

#+end_quote

This sounds wrong. If we take 1970 as a baseline, inflaction since then has devalued the pound by 93% since then. Meaning the Galleon went from 5 pounds to the equivalent of 35 pence. If the exchange rate is static, Muggleborns will buy up the wizarding world in no time.

** I'm just looking at [[http://iset.tsu.ge/files/wp_02-17_Levy_and_Snir_-_Potterian_Economics.pdf][This look at Potterian economics]] by an actual economist. Other than occasional words like Keynsian and a lot of footnotes, it's a clear read. You need to set time aside for it, but to me it's worth it. It discusses /lots/ of prices and how it all works - or doesn't. Everything is argued out very carefully because it's a real paper.

Terms are explained or given book examples and I think someone with little 'economic literacy' can still work through this, and it would be worth it if you, like me, have ever wondered how it all pulls together.
