I just broswing on Google and find a nice story at [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8519866/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Mundane-Magic]]

I wonder if you guys know anything like that? Something about the /filthy Muggles/ give the wizards and witches a good curp stomp, preferably with weapons

This one, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11961978/1/Justice-Justice-Shall-You-Pursue][Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue]], is about the muggle government flexing some muscle.

They do use the assistance of muggleborn wizards in the last couple of chapters, but mostly it's about muggles doing stuff right.

  Goblin courts are inhumane, the Ministry thinks it can arrange marriages, and Voldemort wants to oppress everybody. The muggle government is not amused.

** When I saw "Mundane Power" my mind immediately switched "Mundane" with "Manure"... It ended with me imagining Harry throwing cow shit at his enemies.

Anyway a (Not necessarily good) fic that has this would be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3584221/1/A-Twisted-Timeline][A Twisted Timeline]]. Well, maybe. They have murdered with guns, but magic still plays a large part.

Fair warning though, he literally tells everyone he's a mob boss.
