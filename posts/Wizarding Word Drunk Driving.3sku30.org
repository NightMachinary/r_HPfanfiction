  Hermione put her glass down, and said, "No more for me. I don't want to splinch myself Apparating home."

  Ron took her glass and dumped the remains in his own.

Just an odd little tidbit I've seen/written that I thought I'd share.

Canon says apparation requires the Three D's: Destination, Determination and Deliberation.

So splinching is the equivalent of a car accident!


** Car accident with a tree, maybe. Now I'm wondering if there are multi-wizard collisions in the Floo network.

  "Hello Madam Rosmerta!" I waved hello to the sweet woman as she wooshed passed me in a bout of green smoke.

  I look down toward my destination when a thin, but intimidating farmiliar figure slammed into side.

  "Watch where you're going, Mr. Brown!" the man snapped at me.

  "Sorry, Professor Snape," I squeeked back to my old Potions teacher and shuddered as I tumbled out of the fireplace at Gringotts.

** A drunken broom crash could also be an equivalent to a car crash! Except broom crashes are less likely to hurt other people and more likely to only hurt the flier.
