  Would love it if someone out there as wrote an adoption or even spin-offs that she didn't post to ff.net already.

** linkffn(2488754; 3078469; 5318075) for those unfamiliar with the works in question.

A great read, though it may not have aged as well as others.

  Last fic in the trilogy! Demons invaded Earth intent on enslaving all magical life. But they miscalculated...the Earthling's magic is stronger than they suspected, and far more dangerous. Now the survivors regroup in the new magical world, to fight back.

*** A Harry in name only going off to Canada to train to be an assassin at a school because Voldemort tried to kill him over the summer. Sorry Op, but as far as I know no one has adopted that series and I remember multiple people reportedly spamming her email asking for her to continue the series.

***** It's still one of my all time favorites.

I get that a lot of people don't like it because it is a little cliche, though at the time of writing, I don't remember those things being nearly as cliche.

Harry is a little overpowered, but he's not the only one, so it's really that there's a culture of people that are totally OP compared to the average person.

I also LOVE the world building that went on in that fic. Hell, if she dropped the Harry is Rakhesh thing, and wrote out some of the basis of why Harry went to Akren, it could be its own original work, it's that AU. And I'd totally buy the series if she did go that route!
