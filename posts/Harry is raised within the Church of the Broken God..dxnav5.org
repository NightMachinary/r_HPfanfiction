** Giggling. It was giggling that echoed through the corridor as Dumbledore and his staff advanced. Giggling... and a strange ticking noise...

High but muffled, as if from a child attempting to stifle the sound behind their hand. Clearly not wishing to be given away, but maliciously pleased with whatever mischief they had accomplished.

"Headmaster... oh good Godric." The Fat Lady, her shriek of horror and relief leading to the deathly silence in the room behind her, "They were screaming, so many of them screaming. And then... by Merlin it's quiet now." Severus Snape muttered something snarky, he was ordered to silence with a hiss by multiple sources. The Headmaster and his Heads of Houses took a breath and made silent prayers to varying sources before the ancient Headmaster uttered the password and, with visible and heavy reluctance, the portrait swung open.

In one hand, his wand. Tip glowing white with a Lumos on whatever crimson stained... thing he was working on with the phillips head screwdriver in his other hand. Giggling slowly transitioning to a gentl hum of what could be Twinkle Twinkle... Scruffy black hair, bright green eyes behind massive circular glasses. Skinny, pale and slathered in what could only be blood. He didn't look up at them, he didn't flinch, he transferred his wand to his mouth and narrowed his eyes as he screwed away at the sloppy mess before him.

"Dear- why? WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS?!?!" Snape, roaring as his hands fell away from his greasy hair (that he had been pulling at the moment his coal eyes fell on the... mess of the room they had entered). Silence followed the shout, Snape's heavy gasps and shaking almost silent in the face of the TIK TOK that echoed around the room and emanating from the bloodstained boy curiously staring up at the furious Potions Master.

He cocked his head, he hummed in confusion and something clicked and he giggled. Giggled just as he had when they'd entered, behind his hand "Hmm? Oh, Katie called me a Ticker, so I decided to make her pretty." He flicked his hand to a lump of oddly fleshy mound of metal and blood Minerva could only assume was his upperclassmen Katie Bell. She couldn't do it, she turned away and unloaded the cinatents of her stomach on the shaggy carpet of the common room.

Katie wasn't the only one. There were dozens. The scent of blood massively overblown by the stench of smoke and oil. All coming from the bodies, discarded like dolls Metal grafted onto skin all piled up and left in pools of red and piles of stained and shredded fabric.

"Can I make you pretty too? I think God would really like it." He beamed, almost prettily, from his place on his knees. He was Stunned. Fifteen Stunners throwing him from conciousness, off of his feet and across the room. He landed limply and heavily, his neck pointing off in an unnatural direction...

In an instant, the ticking stopped. Except... no it didn't... Dumbledore's gaze was the first to find the source of the new sound, similarly clockwork sounding as the one that perpetually

Harry was down, unconcious and most likely dead from the odd direction his head was facing.

But as TIK's and TOK's filled the room at various volumes and from various sources, it would appear the rooms other inhabitants were coming through. The Fat Lady screamed, a sound that cut through the air like a blade through paper, slamming her portrait door closed behind the jumpy Professors backs before fleeing to pastures unknown. The Professors only thinking to value their own lives above the age old architecture when the mischievous Weasley twins bit out Snape's throat with teeth fashioned from small drills AND the aforementioned Katie Bell shoved a silver and copper hand through the yielding bosom of her still retching Transfiguration professor. The Hogwarts Professors seeking to save themselves when they blew a hole in the wall to flee, several of their charges lunging after them with varying degrees of higher motor functionality.

It would be seven hours later that a groggy and sore Harry would awaken and return his mechanical neck back to its appropriate position, promplty troubleshooting the rest of his systems before taking a gander at the remaining residents of the Gryffindor common room. Viewing their new enhancements with a mixture of abject terror and worldess awe, blatantly uncomprehending of the form they now took, of how immaculate and perfect their new forms made them. Not yet knowing how much closer they were to God with their metal limbs and cybernetic organs, "So pretty!" He sighed, adoration lacing every sylabble before the first of them rained down upon him with vengeful rage. Dying with a grin surrounded by steam, smoke and the TIK and TOK of Gods perfection.
