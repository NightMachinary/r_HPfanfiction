*** I mean they kinda do broadly. I doubt many straight men want to write extremely graphic gay sex scenes. Of course there are some but likely a minority.

***** Are they straight female writers writing gay male slash or straight male writers writing lesbian scenes? Or straight men writing gay male sex scenes?

** I've never writed smutfics, most of my stories are in 3rd person, so i think a smut would be the same.\\
Even being a heterosexual male i think that write for any of the perspectives would be weird for me.

So i think that depends on each person.

** Yep. Even professional male writers do. Which I see as a positive sign... writers need to be able to get into their characters' heads, to convincingly write characters that aren't the writer.
