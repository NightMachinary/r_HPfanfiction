** If you go the socially accepted route there's not a lot of conflict to be had except perhaps against a bad vampire as opposed to all of society. I feel like there should be at least /some/ disdain for them as they are dark creatures.

Anyway not enough stories portray vampires as horrifying creatures. The few vampire Harry stories I've read just became shitty romances. The blood-sucking and/or cannibalism was barely touched on even though that is THE most important characteristic of vampirism. Sometimes there are stories that actually do focus on the vampirism, but they devolve into an angst parade.

Vampires in harry potter fanfiction are rarely portrayed as fearsome beings. Assuming the story would take place at hogwarts it would be fun if someone wrote it into a bit of a mystery as to why students and teachers are disappearing. If it's Harry (and he likes being a vampire) the first to go would being the slytherins (any excuse to kill off Draco and Snape) and possibly Umbridge in fifth year.

Of course, there are other characters than Harry to use, even if the interesting-ness of balancing the chosen one good guy thing with a vampire cannibalism thing will be a hard story concept to beat.

More than anything I would want the vampire(s) to be a unique character. Someone memorable or a memorable and unique characterization of an existing character. The writer would, of course, have to be able to not only create such a character but also be able to balance the uniqueness of the character with the bloodthirsty monster that they, as a vampire, should be.

*** Nice to hear I haven't fallen into the classic blunders when writing vampires into a story. I've sort of mixed different types of vampires from all sources into my fic. So we've got higher vampires tearing throats out, and savage vampires becoming vargheists when enraged and going apeshit...

The 'good stuff' in other words, lmao.

** I don't like vampires in the HP Universe. I think a vampire at the Slughorn's Christmas Party was one of small jokes by JKR which cannot be developed fully, because it really doesn't work with the rest of the universe. To the realistic bourgeoisie world of more or less rationalist down-to-earth craftsmen, shop-owners, ministry officials, you suddenly get a creature which works in completely different world: much more mythical, unearthly, etc. Vampires are not only non-human (which works perfectly fine for house-elves, centaurs, goblins), but they are not even alive. It is complete mess. Every fanfic story which tries to involve vampires more fully ends with disaster (Northumbrian has his Auror Camelia Tepes, but I think she doesn't exactly fit into what proper vampire should be). I just try to forget they ever existed.

Ehh. I don't see how they're particularly different from all the other magical and mythical aspects of HP. There's no reason why vampires can't get the same Potter-verse treatment that wizards and werewolves and elves and unicorns and dragons get.

**** All vampire-related stories I have heard turned really weird and kind of badly balancing between vampire-world and wizards-world. If you can do better, go for it!

** Early days of the fandom were so riddled with fics where Vampirism was pretty much a joke with so many ways to make it a minor inconvenience. Glamour rings to hide your appearance, bagged animal blood so you never have to hunt someone, a potion so you only have to feed once a month. Snoresville. I want it to be bloody, visceral, dark, and gritty.

** I find it very hard to imagine that there would be /no/ stigma, but it's possible that it's not nearly as severe as with werewolves.

The blood flavored lollipops are very curious if they are actually for vampires as that can imply a high level of acceptance and commonness. Why would you have vampire candies constantly stocked if vampires are very rare? But the shop could just be odd.

But it's also possible that they're actually meant for regular people. I mean... in real life we've got things like blood sausage and pig blood cake. In a society where every flavored beans exist, I don't think it's a huge stretch that there could be an odd candified version of blood flavor for a lollipop for humans.

I think that, if not actual unaging immortality, extremely long lives are a fundamental aspect of vampirism.

There's just too much unknown. There's an awful lot of wiggle room to make up a type of vampirism that fits with what little we were given in canon.

** Two things I would say about the stigma of vamps vs werewolves. I would guess that just about any affliction is a certain level of acceptable as long as they aren't poor. Poverty is pretty much the greatest sin in society, money can cover up a lot of shortcomings and allow Sanguini (I assume he's rich and well connected) a place in social circles. Vampires are rarely depicted as poor because of things like mind control/allure and just time to accumulate wealth, beauty can be a similar advantage. A rich werewolf would likely cover up his condition and honestly I would expect rich people to be less likely to get attacked by a werewolf.

The other factor would be how contagious vampirism is. Werewolves are despised partly because they have no control and are 100% infectious on the night they have no control. If vampires have control and if turning is hard (or at least not incredibly easy) then I feel like there would be less stigma. A small population size due to difficulties turning people would also make them less threatening to the ministry.

I do still feel like there would be some stigma associated, but I think people would find rich, beautiful, non-contagious creatures much more acceptable. I've seen some fics where the turning process results in a squib vampire. They basically exchange magic for their vampiric powers which, again, would make them less threatening to the ministry and the masses.

** I don't like vampires to just have an easy out for any weaknesses they have, Its better if there is no convenient spell and potion. Make them powerful some ways but when they have no weaknesses it make sure kind boring.
