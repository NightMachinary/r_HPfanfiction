I want the gibbering madness, the crashing hurricane of wrath on a hair trigger, a hellhound on a frayed leash held by someone that doesn't quite want to be holding the leash of a freaking hellhound, metropolises burnt to the ground while unclean things crawl through the muck and subsist off of spite and hate.

Give me a story where dark magic isn't just the other side of light magic, a story where it is a real thing that dark witches and wizards do, where it's got the strange in it. Maybe it corrupts you, maybe it warps reality in unpredictable ways, maybe it's fueled by something that shouldn't be. I want a story where dark magic is truly nasty.

Tldr, I want a story where the protagonist goes down the rabbit hole of desperation, but not all of them makes it out the other side. Maybe a little bit of Alice's wonderland came out with them.


** Too young to die has an interesting take on dark magic.

Not for everyone though

*** Yeah I've tried reading that one. I dunno, something about it keeps me from really enjoying it.
