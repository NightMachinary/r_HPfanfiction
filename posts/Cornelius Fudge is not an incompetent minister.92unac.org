The first we see of Fudge is when he arrests Hagrid. From our point of view, as readers, this is wrong as we know that Tom Riddle was responsible for both openings of Chamber of Secrets.

From the Ministry's point of view, and as such Cornelius Fudge's, Hagrid has criminal records stating that he opened the chamber once before. Once they arrested him the first time, the attacks stopped. It is only logical to assume he is responsible once again. Proof about the records:

#+begin_quote
  “Look, Albus,” said Fudge, uncomfortably. “Hagrid's

  record's against him.
#+end_quote

On the other hand, we have this quote which kinda contradicts me:

#+begin_quote
  “Look at it from my point of view,” said Fudge,

  fidgeting with his bowler. “I'm under a lot of pressure.

  Got to be seen to be doing something."
#+end_quote

While that does sound like he doesn't know what he's doing, he still chooses the most logical course of action. Instead of slow politics, he chose to act, when he had evidence that the culprit was responsible.

Now the removal of Dumbledore from Hogwarts.

This was not, in fact, done by the Minister, but by Lucius Malfoy and the governors. In fact, Fudge was against such an idea.

#+begin_quote
  “ Dreadful thing, Dumbledore,” said Malfoy lazily,

  taking out a long roll of parchment, “but the

  governors feel it's time for you to step aside. This is

  an Order of Suspension --- you'll find all twelve

  signatures on it. I'm afraid we feel you're losing your

  touch. How many attacks have there been now? Two

  more this afternoon, wasn't it? At this rate, there'll be

  no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts, and we all know

  what an awful loss that would be to the school.”

  “Oh, now, see here, Lucius,” said Fudge, looking

  alarmed, “Dumbledore suspended --- no, no --- last

  thing we want just now --- ”

  “The appointment --- or suspension --- of the

  headmaster is a matter for the governors, Fudge,”

  said Mr. Malfoy smoothly. “And as Dumbledore has

  failed to stop these attacks --- ”
#+end_quote

Lucius, in fact, has made a great point. Dumbledore clearly looks to be incompetent and Hogwarts would be better with someone more competent appointed. This is from the view of the governors. This is a pretty competent action. An action that even if Fudge had known, he could not have stopped.

Let's move to book three, shall we?

First that we hear of the Minister in that book is here:

#+begin_quote
  “We are doing all we can to recapture Black,” said the

  Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge, this morning,

  “and we beg the magical community to remain calm.”
#+end_quote

Followed by this:

#+begin_quote
  Fudge has been criticized by some members of the

  International Federation of Warlocks for informing the

  Muggle Prime Minister of the crisis.
#+end_quote

And a valid counter-argument comes from our man himself:

#+begin_quote
  “Well, really, I had to, don't you know,” said an

  irritable Fudge. “Black is mad. He's a danger to

  anyone who crosses him, magic or Muggle.
#+end_quote

I'd like to add, that not only does it strengthen the relationship between the Muggle government and Magic one, it also combines both of the forces. Magicals look for Black in the Magical world, whilst Muggles look for him in the Muggle world.

Sirius Black is now twice as likely to be captured.

Later Fudge met Harry, but nothing bad could be said about that.

The dementors, who in the eyes of the ministry, obey the ministry.

It is only logical, to send them to protect the school. A school that produces all the wizards of Britan and houses the boy-who-lived. That school seems very important to protect.

Even more so, since last year Dumbledore appeared to be to incompotent to solve the issue himself.

The ministry had no reason to believe that the dementors would not obey the ministry's orders.

Fudge does not like placing dementors at Hogwarts but, honestly that was the best choice.

Here's his opinion about this:

#+begin_quote
  “Rosmerta, m'dear, I don't like them any more than

  you do,” said Fudge uncomfortably. “Necessary

  precaution ... unfortunate, but there you are.
#+end_quote

So unless Rosmerta likes to get freaky with the dementors, we can assume Fudge dislikes this as well.

More proof:

#+begin_quote
  “All the same,” demurred Fudge, “they are here to

  protect you all from something much worse. ... We all

  know what Black's capable of. ...”

  I was Junior Minister in the Department of Magical

  Catastrophes at the time, and I was one of the first on

  the scene after Black murdered all those people. I --- I

  will never forget it. I still dream about it sometimes. A

  crater in the middle of the street, so deep it had

  cracked the sewer below. Bodies everywhere. Muggles

  screaming. And Black standing there laughing, with

  what was left of Pettigrew in front of him ... a heap of

  bloodstained robes and a few --- a few fragments --- ”

  Fudge's voice stopped abruptly.
#+end_quote

Proof that the threat of Sirius haunted him to this very day.

Let's get even more proof, shall we?

#+begin_quote
  “Is it true he's mad, Minister?”

  “I wish I could say that he was,” said Fudge slowly.

  Yet I met Black on my last

  inspection of Azkaban. You know, most of the

  prisoners in there sit muttering to themselves in the

  dark; there's no sense in them ... but I was shocked

  at how normal Black seemed. He spoke quite

  rationally to me. It was unnerving. You'd have

  thought he was merely bored --- asked if I'd finished

  with my newspaper, cool as you please, said he

  missed doing the crossword. Yes, I was astounded at

  how little effect the dementors seemed to be having on

  him --- and he was one of the most heavily guarded in

  the place, you know. Dementors outside his door day

  and night.”
#+end_quote

Then the whole Buckbeak thing.

He *INJURED* a student. Critically so.

While we know that Draco was pretending, Fudge likely was not aware. Lucius could have easily bought some documents showing how .../critically/ his son was injured.

From Fudge's point of view, such a dangerous beast should not threaten students anymore.

Now, onto the matter of him not believing Harry's story.

Well, Harry had no actual evidence (except words of a deranged murderer, and his accomplice), while there were numerous explanations on why Harry thought that way.

Also, numerous witnesses that saw Peter's death.

Do I really need to talk more about this?

I think not.

The disappearance of Bertha Jorkins

His words say everything that needs to be said.

#+begin_quote
  “Ludo says Bertha's perfectly

  capable of getting herself lost. I agree we would have

  expected to have found her by now, but all the same,

  we've no evidence of foul play, Dumbledore, none at

  all. As for her disappearance being linked with Barty

  Crouch's!”
#+end_quote

Him disbelieving the rise of Voldemort.

Neither Dumbledore nor Harry had any actual evidence.

As far as he, and possibly the whole world knows, there is no way to bring someone back from the dead.

I'd assume that Horcruxes, Inferi, Voldemort's resurrection potion, are very rare pieces of magic, that are almost impossible to find.

Hence, no one would now about them.

Also, Dumbledore is an old, possibly senile, war veteran, that was a friend to the parents of the boy-who-lived.

The child, who was making those claims.

A child who lost their parents to Voldemort.

In Fudge's eyes, this was simply Dumbledore's way of supporting/calming Harry down.

The murder of Cedric Diggory could have been done by anyone. Even by an imposter calling himself a name of a long dead man.

Harry's trial

Harry Potter, the boy-who-lived, was an important celebrity and he should have been judged as such.

Something our /superior/ Muggle government never does.

And, that' all folks!


** I agree with you on most points. Except one, when he goes to arrest Hagrid and the quote "We've got to be seen doing something". From my perspective it really does seem as if he doesn't actually believe Hagrid is responsible but imprisons him anyway.

Otherwise most of what you said makes sense.

*** I'd argue that it's irrelevant whether or not Fudge believed in Hagrid's guilt.

In the muggle world only corrupt and tyrannical governments incarcerate people without first giving them a trail. Remember that Hagrid wasn't just put in a holding cell: he was sent directly to Azkaban where he would suffer what the Muggle world would consider "cruel and unusual punishment."

Fudge was a blood purist if I recall. He would have found strange that Hagrid could open the CoS, and not have the Slytherins blood.

But hey, it worked before. Surely it will work again.

But if there's not enough evidence to show he did it, why expel him?

Does the wizarding world really scale punishment up based on the amount of evidence there is? So if there's only a little evidence, and they're only 10% sure he committed a crime, give him 10% of the punishment?

**** Do we know for sure if Hagrid /didn't/ have any Slytherin blood? The Wizarding World is small enough, and the original Professor Slytherin old enough, that it's likely most every non-Muggle-born wizard is related to him in some way.

As for whether Fudge was a blood-purist, it's complicated. He wasn't a hardcore bigot, and didn't /despise/ Muggle-borns like the Death Eaters did (nor did he have anything against half-bloods to a meaningful degree). But he was "old-fashioned", influence by the general wizarding snobbery. e.g. he wouldn't deny a Muggle-born a high-level position if they proved capable, but he would consider it "an unusual achievement, considering his ¨cough cough¨ parentage" (only to change the subject if someone like Dumbledore asked precisely what he meant by that).

They take any info as canon. Games/posters/interviews/movies/etc.

While Interviews may be canon (some do not believe so, because JKR tends to contradict herself) a lot of their info is not.

Here's their description of Disarming Charm:

#+begin_quote

*** Fudge's government doesn't function like a peace-time government. By muggle standards his administration is corrupt and tyrannical.

In book 2 he presides over [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indefinite_detention_without_trial][indefinite incarceration without trial]] with an additional side of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruel_and_unusual_punishment][cruel and unusual punishment]].

#+begin_quote
  “Take me?” said Hagrid, who was trembling. “Take me where?”

  “For a short stretch only,” said Fudge, not meeting Hagrid's eyes. “Not a punishment, Hagrid, more a precaution. If someone else is caught, you'll be let out with a full apology ---”

  ...

  “Dear, dear, you know, that temper of yours will lead you into trouble one of these days, Hagrid,” said Mr. Malfoy. “I would advise you not to shout at the Azkaban guards like that. They won't like it at all.”
#+end_quote

In book 3 he attempts to commit [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summary_execution][summary execution]] of a man who had been incarcerated indefinitely without trial.

#+begin_quote
  “The Kiss will be performed immediately?”

  "As soon as Macnair returns with the dementors. This whole Black affair has been highly embarrassing. I can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to informing the Daily Prophet that we've got him at last."
#+end_quote

In book 4 he was directly involved in the summary execution of Bartemius Crouch Jr, thereby denying Crouch's victims justice and silencing his testimony regarding Voldemort's return.

#+begin_quote
  “The moment that --- that thing entered the room,” she screamed, pointing at Fudge, trembling all over, “it swooped down on Crouch and --- and ---”

  Harry felt a chill in his stomach as Professor McGonagall struggled to find words to describe what had happened. He did not need her to finish her sentence. He knew what the dementor must have done. It had administered its fatal Kiss to Barty Crouch. It had sucked his soul out through his mouth. He was worse than dead.

  “By all accounts, he is no loss!” blustered Fudge. “It seems he has been responsible for several deaths!”

  “But he cannot now give testimony, Cornelius,” said Dumbledore. He was staring hard at Fudge, as though seeing him plainly for the first time. “He cannot give evidence about why he killed those people.”
#+end_quote

In book 5 he breaks the law by ordering the confiscation of a minor's wand without first proving wrongdoing. He then orchestrates the trial of said minor while attempting to deny the defendant access to a lawyer and the benefit of witness testimony.

#+begin_quote
  “The Ministry does not have the power to expel Hogwarts students, Cornelius, as I reminded you on the night of the second of August,” said Dumbledore. “Nor does it have the right to confiscate wands until charges have been successfully proven, again, as I reminded you on the night of the second of August. In your admirable haste to ensure that the law is upheld, you appear, inadvertently I am sure, to have overlooked a few laws yourself.”

  “Laws can be changed,” said Fudge savagely.

  “Of course they can,” said Dumbledore, inclining his head. “And you certainly seem to be making many changes, Cornelius. Why, in the few short weeks since I was asked to leave the Wizengamot, it has already become the practice to hold a full criminal trial to deal with a simple matter of underage magic!”
#+end_quote

Also in book 5, Fudge's administration enacted a broad reaching campaign of state censorship and propaganda.

#+begin_quote
  "What's more, the Ministry's leaning heavily on the Daily Prophet not to report any of what they're calling Dumbledore's rumor-mongering, so most of the Wizarding community are completely unaware anything's happened, and that makes them easy targets for the Death Eaters if they're using the Imperius Curse.”

  ...

  “Tonks and Arthur would lose their jobs at the Ministry if they started shooting their mouths off,” said Sirius.

A good leader would investigate. Actually, any leader in his right mind would investigate first. Fudge just immediately buried his head in sand. He got so scared he got Barty Jr. kissed on the spot, which is one of the most irritating things he did in the series. It took away all the information they could've gotten from one of Voldemort's closest operators.

So yeah, he's not an incompetent politician, but I'd consider him an incompetent leader considering what he did in book 5.

Umbridge for one was in Hogwarts for most of 5th year and she's very deferent to Fudge.

Malfoy on the other hand was not a ministry employee. He had no authority to do anything official. Also he couldn't really afford to over-step his relationship with fudge because in Fudge's understanding he's a just a "friend", a benefactor working for the good of the wizarding world. More than likely Malfoy is just there to steer Fudge in directions beneficial to him. He can't have been actually doing Fudge's job for him.

All I'm saying is Fudge is far from incompetent. Imagine for a second Hagrid was actually evil. Put him in place as MoM and have him do the smear campaign against Harry and Dumbledore. Do you think Hagrid would do a good job at it? No, because Hagrid would've actually been *incompetent* at that job. As a comparison, Fudge is far from that.

Umbridge may even doublethink that Fudge /really/ is in charge, but she's more than happy to "act in his best interest" behind his back.

One must remember that there's little question Malfoy is bribing Fudge (in a way he likely plays off as gifts between friends, but Fudge, a Slytherin, probably sees past /that/). Fudge considers Malfoy a friend more than willing to help out with whatever /he/ needs as long as the Ministry does him a few favors along the way. So first, over a series of friendly talks, Malfoy (and Umbridge, and any number of other "Imperiused" Death Eaters and sympathizers) convince him that Dumbledore is /definitely/ out for /his/ job and needs ousting. Then Fudge begins to ponder the specifics, and panics, because he has no idea how to achieve this. Then Umbridge, with a modest smile, hands him a nice flowchart of what to do, and Malfoy very kindly slips Fudge the necessary galleons for his little "enterprise of mutual interest to him, to Malfoy, and to the Wizarding World at large".

And I am entirely convinced that if Evil-Hagrid's circle of friends was also reversed --- if an evil Dumbledore was in Malfoy's place, and an evil McGonagall in Umbridge's, say --- you could very well have gotten identical results.

Yes, I /do/ think he's that bad. Or, rather, that clueless. I don't think Fudge is fundamentally dumb, but I think he's too self-centered and small-minded to really be able to handle being "the man at the top" in a crisis. He was fine as a mid-level bureaucrat, but got elected Minister even though /he/ didn't even think he stood a chance (with his prospected opponent being Dumbledore), and, at that point, lost it, trying to keep appearances while relying entirely on other people's advice.

At first it was Dumbledore's (through the letters we see him get bombarded with from Fudge), hence why the Wizarding World mostly didn't fall apart for the first few years; but then Fudge's fearful nature took over, he worried that Dumbledor was just manipulating him for his own end, and he started listening to the advice of his old school friend Lucius, and of his ever-so-charming and loyal Undersecretary Dolores, and of those nice Msr Jugson, Rosier and Macnair...

I agree. I've said before he's not a very good leader. Only that he's not an incompetent politician.

All the things you've mentioned makes him a bad leader, specially for wartime because he cracks easily under pressure. But that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying he's not incompetent at being a /politician/. He can pull strings, he can handle all the bureaucracy, the bribes and political factions all that stuff. That's why he was able to pass all those Educational decrees and practically supress and silence the media to an extent. Give me solid proof that Fudge can't do these things himself.

** I don't read Fudge as incompetent. The most incompetent things about his term are the fact that he kept pestering Dumbledore with questions for his first couple years, and setting dementors to guard Hogwarts. The main problem with Fudge is that he is /corrupt/, and gets more /corrupt/ as time goes on.

In Book 2, Fudge jails Hagrid without trial just to score political points. To be sure, there are serious questions about Hagrid from the public's perspective, but those questions should have been aired out decades ago when Dumbledore hired him. Why would Dumbledore hire an underage boy as caretaker who had /just/ been expelled for a good reason (illegally keeping a class XXXXX creature on school grounds) and was under suspicion for killing a student?

Fudge is being sensible--competent--in wanting Hagrid off school grounds. But he's being corrupt in shipping him straight to Azkaban instead of putting him on trial. He's also being sensible in disagreeing with Malfoy about Dumbledore leaving. Note that he still more or less likes and trusts Dumbledore at this point.

In Book 3, putting dementors around Hogwarts was a very poor decision, which may be a sign of incompetence. Yes, Fudge trusts them to obey the Ministry absolutely, but everyone ought to know that dementors should not be allowed around children. Also, Black escaped them before, so how would they help. Even if we allow this, the fact that he left them there after they attacked the Quidditch match makes him look very incompetent.

Other than this, though, I still say it's corruption. It's true that Fudge has no evidence for Harry's claims. He might not even know that Sirius was sent to Azkaban without trial. (It's plausible that only Barty Crouch knows that.) But Dumbledore believes Harry, and when a distinguished national hero like Dumbledore makes a claim like that, one whom Fudge himself considered an important advisor a year ago, it's a good idea to take a second look at the case. Fudge refuses to listen because it would reflect poorly on his administration now, especially after the Dementor mess, and on his handling of the case back in 1981.

I would also draw attention to what I think is the most telling quote about Fudge in the whole series:

#+begin_quote
  "Good gracious, Minister, he isn't trying to rejoin You-Know-Who, is he?"

  "I daresay that's his--er--eventual plan," said Fudge evasively. "But we hope to catch Black long before that. I must say, You-Know-Who alone and friendless is one thing...but give him back his most devoted servant, and I shudder to think how quickly he'll rise again..."
#+end_quote

In Book 3, Fudge believes that Voldemort is still out there! In light of this, that he changes his tune when it actually happens is even more alarming.

In Book 4, it's a little harder to determine his motives in regard to Barty Crouch Jr. Why did he bring a Dementor with him when he visited the castle? Was he truly that afraid of an Azkaban escapee? Or was he /intending/ Barty to get Kissed. I tend to think it's the latter. McGonagall said the Dementor attacked Barty immediately upon entering the room. If that was not Fudge's intent, he should have been far more alarmed by the Dementor disobeying his orders, and yet he still insists on the Ministry's absolute control over the Dementors in Book 5.

It's possible that Fudge was simply implementing his Kiss on Sight policy for Azkaban escapees, but seeing as he had to know that Barty was a critical witness in the death of a student, there was good reason to keep him alive, and besides, if that was what he was doing, why go up to the school on the premise of interrogating him? Was it because Barty Jr's testimony or his even being alive would hurt his administration by ruining the reputation of Barty Sr?

Finally, his denial of Voldemort's return. Again, he changed his beliefs from Book 3. Why? Yes, there's no physical evidence. Yes, as far as he knows, it's impossible to return from the dead. Yes, as far as he knows, Dumbledore is old and possibly senile. But he doesn't go to any of those explanations. Instead, he accuses Dumbledore of trying to steal his job! That strongly suggests something more sinister than mere disbelief.

Similarly, he doesn't try to give Harry equal treatment despite his celebrity status at his trial. He goes out of his way to railroad Harry into being expelled, calling in the full Wizengamot and changing the time at the last minute.

So no, I don't believe Fudge's actions are those of an incompetent man. But they are also not the actions of a competent man who is trying to do the right thing. To me, they show deep corruption in his administration, completely independent of everything Malfoy and Umbridge do.

** Fudge started out as potentially a very good minister.

But his determination to deny Voldemort's return and paint Harry and Dumbledore as mad is a cowardly move-as is his decision to jail Hagrid. He was too swayed by the likes of Lucius and fear.

Dumbledore did have evidence and Fudge essentially killed Barry Crouch Jr rather then hear it. Fudge was in denial-he did believe that Voldemort had returned but didn't want to face that reality (as fairly terrifying as it is-notably Scrimgeour did die as minister).

Jailing Hagrid is a cowardly decision. Fudge knows as well as anyone that Hagrid hadn't been doing it. If he didn't believe in it, then there's other options-outside of jailing him-that would have worked. The decision in the original expelling is that Hagrid had unwillingly exposed Hogwarts to dangerous creatures (entirely true), if that's the case again-what creature? what can they do to get rid of it? But Fudge didn't ever want to put his head on the line (figuratively and quite literally later on).

Fudge is pretty believable person at the end of the day, he's not meant to be evil or bad, just cowardly and ambitious.

WW1, the bloodiest and most devastating war of all time, had ended just decades prior, and he was understandably terrified of getting Britain into another war. This isn't to say that he wasn't incompetent though. It was pretty clear at that point that Germany would not stop at Poland and Austria and Czech.

Barty Crouch execution, same example its not his job, at most it should have been Amelia Bones's or Scrimgeour's.

See the pattern?

Well, no one had any contradictory evidence, except Dumbledore who wasn't sharing his, so maybe he felt a trial would have accomplished nothing and would have wasted everyone's time?

********** From Sirius's explanation in book 4, we know that the legal system in wizarding Britain functioned about the same as the muggle one until the war with Voldemort, at which point Crouch Sr. used the desperation of the populace as an excuse to get rid of many of the legal checks and balances that protect human rights.

  “Well, times like that bring out the best in some people and the worst in others. Crouch's principles might've been good in the beginning --- I wouldn't know. He rose quickly through the Ministry, and he started ordering very harsh measures against Voldemort's supporters. The Aurors were given new powers --- powers to kill rather than capture, for instance. And I wasn't the only one who was handed straight to the dementors without trial. Crouch fought violence with violence, and authorized the use of the Unforgivable Curses against suspects. I would say he became as ruthless and cruel as many on the Dark Side."
#+end_quote

Crouch basically implemented a corrupt form of martial law. Under his leadership, the police could kill without proving any wrong doing (sound like something that's a big deal in America right now?). Anyone, guilty or innocent, could be given a lifetime sentence in prison without trial. and torture was allowed against captives.

After the war was over, the checks and balances were never put back in place. As a result, corrupt and self-serving politicians like Fudge could kill or incarcerate innocent people with impunity.
