How would you wwrite a Grindelwald who wants to redeem himself?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]] is exactly that. Although he's trying really hard, as the title says, old habits die hard.

*** It's quite bad though. All the characters are unlikeable and whilst the premise and title make it sound fun, the tone isn't really and it didn't make me laugh.
