:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I asked for this once already, but I remember more stuff so I'm asking one more time-

So I remember that Harry owes a LOT of money to the MoM with his lordships, and that Daphne and Draco join the Golden Trio in exploring the properties Harry owns. They fix up some, sell some, and I remember that Harry and Daphne get together in the end. I also vaguely remember Harry Ron and Draco bonding and riding a super fast magic carpet....

It's not novocaine, I read that one before and I know that's not it... but I can't remember what it is!!

Any help would be great!

** It could be this one. It's a rewrite version of a fic that really reminds me of what you described. There might be new changes so youu should probably check the original version to make sure.
