Hi.

I've got this fanfic stuck in my head but I can't remember the name and I really want to read it again. Please, please help!!!

It's a Harry and Hermione romance story. Voldemort is dead. The magic world is a bit backwards. They use carriages, have balls and young ladies 'come out' so that they can catch eligible wizards. It begins with Hermione and Ginny at a ball. Hermione has finished school and the Weasley's are sponsoring/hosting her because her parents are muggles, so if she gets a marriage proposal, then Arthur Weasley can refuse or accept on her behalf. Anyway Harry shows up at the ball which is a surprise because he has been out of the country with Ron (on vacation) since graduating. All the girls want to marry him, but he only notices Hermione. She finds this strange because at school, although they were head girl and head boy, they weren't really friends. She also doesn't have very high self esteem. Harry finally proposes and she accepts. Mr Weasley agrees. The couple eventually confess their love for each other and are married. Years later, Ron comes to visit the couple and has an argument with Harry. Ron wanted Hermione but he was too busy drinking and having fun with other woman to come home when they heard Hermione was 'coming out'. Harry had rushed home when he heard this and that's how they met and got married.

I'm really hoping that someone will be able to help me with this.

Thanks.
