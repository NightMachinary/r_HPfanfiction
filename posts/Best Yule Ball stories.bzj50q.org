What are some of the best Yule Ball stories out there? Would prefer Harry/Ginny centric stuff but I'm open to anything.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8274067][Or the Look Or the Words]] linkao3(8274067) - Harry/Ron

And if you'll forgive the shameless self-promotion, I wrote a Yule Ball fic: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18143687][put it down in the pleasure of your company]] linkao3(18143687) - Harry & Ron friendship, gen.

*** Unrelated question: Why do you not capitalize your titles sometimes?

I notice some authors do this, and it doesn't really bother me I'm just curious if there's a reason for it? Is it some sort of statement, or just a stylistic choice? Or do you just.. not capitalize them because you don't capitalize your titles usually?

At first I took it as laziness, and/or improper grammar. After reading a few things that are excellently written, but still titled that way I've definitely moved on from that point of view. Now I'm just curious if there's a reason or if it's a 'fuck it, I like it this way' sort of decision.

**** Not capitalizing titles (especially relatively long ones) has been a trend on AO3 for several years now. I don't know exactly why it started (my best guess is that it was an aesthetic choice) but it caught on and now lowercase titles just "look right" to me. Occasionally I'll give a fic a shorter, capitalized title, but that's definitely the exception rather than the norm at this point.

** Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16237082/chapters/37957664]])

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18502153/chapters/43845541]])

The first doesn't focus on the Yule Ball, but I included it because the writer just concluded the Yule Ball. Very well written story. Hinny.

The second does focus on the Yule Ball, and after words. Uses a familiar set up of Harry asking Hermione out as soon as McGonagall tells him about the Champion's Dance. Harmony. Major Weasley (Ron, Ginny, Molly) and Dumbledore bashing.

*** That first fic doesn't really fit the request, I think, but thanks for posting it anyways. Looks like a very interesting Sirius/OC fic, which I've not really read much of before.

  What if Sirius didn't spent twelve years in prison, but was given a trial after four years? Follow the story of Sirius Black as he learns what it means to be a father/brother/guardian to his young godson & the story of Harry Potter, a young boy with a loving home who learns about the Marauders from the two men who should have raised him. M for later. Eventual Hinny.

  Who knew Harry asking Hermione to the Yule Ball in Fourth Year would cause so much drama? Especially amongst those whom they thought were their truest friends!
