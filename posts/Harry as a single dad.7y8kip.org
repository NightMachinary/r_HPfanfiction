Any good fic preferably slice of life, focused on parenting and the child growing in the magical world?

-better if is a single child, but ok if there are multiple

-better if he has a daughter but a son is ok

-better 40k+ but shorter is ok

-better if the mom isn't Ginny but ok anyway

-no drama if possible

-ok even if it's not his biological son or daughter (ex. Teddy,...) but better if he/she is.

-ok if the mother is dead but better with something less tragic(ex. she left, it was a one night thing,...)

-if there are some I suppose a fic where Harry is a housedaddy and the mother spends simply a lot of time away is ok (ex. Work,...)

Ps. Not a native speaker sorry for my English

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  With Sirius dead, Harry expected a summer filled with dark times, marinating on how he was to blame. What he did not expect was for the Dursleys to thrust a baby into his arms and declare it his. One night of recklessness was enough, but he refused to leave the baby with the Dursleys. Could he do this at 16 on top of school and extra Defense? (Mentor/Fatherly Snape, eventually.)
