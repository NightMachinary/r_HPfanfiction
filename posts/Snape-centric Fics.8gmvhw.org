I'm looking for anything that prominently features a well-written Snape. I'm fine with shipping, but what I really want is clever plot and characterization. A funny, ornery Snape gets a bonus.


** linkao3(A Year Like None Other)

A Year Like None Other, by aspeninthesunlight. A Severitus, but a very good one. Well-written and intense. No slash and no pairings.

  Severus wakes up in the afterlife expecting something rather different than being almost-seventeen again. Seriously, what kind of game is this? But wait - Lily's come back, too - from 1981? Perhaps it's a second chance... but to do what? SS/LE

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.

** It's a crossover with /Worm,/ but /Path to Victory --- A Severus Snape Story/ is pretty good. linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11537837/2/]]). You don't need to know much about Worm to enjoy it, other than this: Snape gets the superpower to predict a sequence of future steps that lead him down the path to victory. In other words, his power is to know how to succeed at *anything.*

  In Worm you might gain phenomenal powers on your worst day. Snape snapped after the werewolf incident and triggered with Path to Victory, the power that tells you the steps necessary to attain any goal. Follow Severus as tackles his troubles, and the Wizarding World's, with the help of a nigh omniscient voice whispering pretty things to him in the back of his mind.

** If you like teenager Snape, give this one linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/589726/chapters/1060711]]) a shot, it is one of my favorite fanfictions ever. Do not let the summary or first chapter discourage you, it's AMAZING.

Oh, and that one: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6693841]]) - It is about an unlikely friendship, fits into canon and is just... something else. Have tissues ready and someone to hug. It is one of those stories that makes you love humanity a little.

  When he looked back on it in later years, Severus realized how much worse his life could have gone. Those few short months in Sixth Year were of much greater importance than he could have ever known at the time. Then again, it was hard to have perspective on something like that at 16, when his daily existence consisted of constantly dodging hexes and being ignored by Lily Evans. The Professor had known, though. That's why he'd come.
