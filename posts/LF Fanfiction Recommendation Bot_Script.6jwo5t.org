Hi, I faintly remember that a while ago there was a bot/script on a website where you could input a fanfiction into, and similar/related fics would be generated through the bot. Does anyone know of what I'm talking about, and the link to said website? I'm trying to do this as I'm currently reading Inell's "Worth the Risk" and am finding it to be an absolute joy to read (So if you know of this fic and could provide any rec's that'd be great as well).

Thank you!
