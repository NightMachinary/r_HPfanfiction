** This fic has only one real problem: Whenever a new chapter is released I have to read the last 5 aswell to remember what is going on. There are some other fic where this might be true not never to this extend.

Unfortunately this also means the chapters feel rather short, even though they aren't really and ARE rather good.

** The author has so far replied to every review of the latest chapter on SIYE. He also indicated that chapters 29-31 are mostly done, and I expect this story to be completed soon.

*** The author has problems with formatting for FF.net, so he generally post on SIYE first.
