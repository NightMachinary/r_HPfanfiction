Is Ron's ability to consume legendary amounts of food canon? I just started a... well it is a humor fic so grain of salt I suppose... but Hermione had a nightmare/dream where Ron was eating the castle. When she ask Harry about it the next morning Harry admitted to worrying about that once because Ron had missed breakfast and Harry caught him gnawing on a tapestry. Is this something that can be cited in canon or is it a fanon theme that's been adopted because it's hilarious?

--------------

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6624252/6/Nocturnal][Nocturnal]] for those who're curious.

Also found in this fic:

- Ron's failed attempts to recreate the summon charm so as to steal malfoy's roast duck.

- Ron's creation of creatures out of food that he then proceeds to 'stalk' before eating them.

- Ron's lamentation that Ginny keeps bringing him chickens (year 2) but he doesn't know any de-feathering charms. Harry being at a loss as to explain what happened to collection of chickens this implies Ron must be stockpiling.


** I think it's mentioned that he has poor manners at the table, but being one of the youngest of such a large family, he would likely have to eat quickly to make sure he gets enough.

*** I think the main reason why so many fics emphasize Ron eating so much is because that's one of the few character traits he has. He likes quidditch and eating, while he dislikes studying and spiders. He's jealous, inconsiderate, and nice at times as well, but those are rare and only relate to other people. Ron by himself isn't very interesting.

**** Ron is one of the top 5 most developed characters in the entire series I fail to see how you can claim he's uninteresting.

** Ron's messy eating is [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEKuP-8jdA][played for laughs]] a few times in the books/movies, but blown out of proportion by the Ron bashers. People also seem to forget that a lot of 11-16 year old boys eat a lot and have messy table manners.

*** Indeed. As I recall unless I was doing something school related I was either sleeping or stuffing my face. Get home from school - raid fridge - nap - raid fridge again/dinner - homework (with snacks) - sleep. Repeat every day throughout puberty. Based on people I know, I'd say it's a pretty common formula for male adolescense.

  male ascension
#+end_quote

I see... Males ascend due to over eating, it is indeed an important trait.

That said, I recall similar circumstances when I was growing up. However, I was on the track team and training for long distance.... I don't know know how my parents kept enough food in the house and I would not want to be the person who interrupted me before my nap after that running.

** It's mentioned briefly that he has poor manners and then it became blown way out of proportion and just another reason that he's secretly raping Hermione for some people.

***** Bashing/randomly evil fics are the worst, and yet they seem so popular.

Dumbledore was manipulative, yes, but that doesn't mean he's been using the Weasleys and love potions to get Harry/Hermione repeatedly raped. Which could maybe, /maybe/, be accepted were it not for the narration doing shit like Dumbledork/Dumbles/Moldyshorts/or whatever the hell is popular these days.

Yes, I'm grumpy.

****** Of course Dumbledore is using the Weasleys that way, while Snape is busy raping students, and Ron is a pureblood supremacist that wants Hermione to be a housewife / house elf and nothing more. It's just so much more dramatic than Dumbledore being manipulative yet well meaning, Snape being a broken man who takes out his rage at the world on students, and Ron just has no clue about muggles because he was never around them. Or you know, instead of "dramatic" write "shit" and you get the perspective of anyone over the age of 15.

** It is a mix. Canon has him eating a lot, and he talks about food enthusiastically sometimes. The first thing he says to Harry after /Harry/ stuffs himself stupid at the welcoming feast first year is:

#+begin_quote
  “Great food, isn't it?” Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings.
#+end_quote

The movies add to that. I think there are a couple...a few...actually, quite a lot of Ron eating-Hermione disgusted humorous moments. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoEKuP-8jdA][A montage of Ron eating]]. That is also their first ever scene together in the first movie, which colors a lot of fanon on this issue.

It is much more subtle in the books, though, and even in the movies is more of "Ron, do you ever stop eating?" than him being a disgusting pig at the table all the time.

--------------

Interesting side note: Harry eats everything but the peppermint humbugs at that first feast, then after in their dorms:

#+begin_quote
  Harry was going to ask Ron if he'd had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once
#+end_quote

Suggesting the other fanon food-related preference Harry has. Really, Harry is the one obsessed with food /most/ of the time in the first book. But those are /internal/ thoughts in the books, and don't really make it to the movies for that reason.

--------------

Weak writers need strong traits for their character assassinations, though, and this is a popular one. Hate Ron's characterization for other reasons, but not for this.

** I think its happens quite often in canon and the movies. Though to my shame, my shippers often bash him and use these scenes to do it, to the point almost of ridiculousness. He is a a teenage boy, and they don't often have good manners, at all. And are almost always hungry. Its also important to remember that these books are told from Harry's perspective who grew up starved, and even though his uncle and cousin were pretty obese, they probably always ate with good manners, to keep up appearances and so Petunia wouldnt poison them.

So it WOULD be something Harry would notice and comment on (even if it is in his head).

Though my favourite is when in the "Firebird Trilogy" when he's told he'll find a girl when he stops eating like a krup
