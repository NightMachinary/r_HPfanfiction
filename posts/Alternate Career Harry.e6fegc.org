《Wanna Make A Thread Of Alternate, But In Character/Believable, Jobs For Harry》

Born from a desire to still do good in the world but being very much DONE with fighting Dark Wizards, Harry has a change of heart in regards to his career path.

At eighteen he's very used to (and VERY over) the lying press and the snooping paparazzi. Though he is somewhat intrigued at the lengths they will go for their stories and the true power they wield with a quill over a wand.

He isn't some soulless crone out for sensationalism! He spent years at Hogwarts uncovering dark secrets and exposing evil people for who they truly are, ignored by people who would not listen when he told them what's what (he still scowled at the thought of Malfoy and the Dursley's).

He is a seeker of truth and that truth is what he intends to give to the the people of the Magical world.

Thus I present to ye: Harry James Potter - Investigative Reporter


** Harry is smart enough and stubborn enough to probably succeed in any career, it's more a matter of getting his lazy ass (when it comes to school work) to sit down and get qualified for it. That being said:

Curse breaker is one of my favorites

DADA Professor

Pro Quidditch

International “fix it” wizard can be interesting

He COULD be a shop keeper, but I don't think he'd enjoy it (celebrity gawkers would drive him mad) - Prank inventor for WWW seems more likely actually

*** There are a lot of magical phenomena (that are either rare to just straight impossible) that happen to/around Harry that he could very much want to get to the bottom of.

• He reflected the Killing Curse at one, thus proving the Killing Curse is not unblockable. He could research ways to block it with the Unspeakables.

• Priori Incantatum, though not unexplained he way want to further delve into the thing that very much saved his ass from Voldemort multiple times.

• He came back from the dead! Don't wanna look any further into that?

• Hell, he may have been over Sirius's death but researching the Veil would still be in character. There's so much for Unspeakable Harry to do.

*** I read an unspeakable Harry one, but I can't for the life of me remember what it was (and I'm not sure if I finished it). Basically, he picked the DoM because he could hide there easier (and had his pick of departments at the ministry).

I remember him feeling out of place because he had like, zero qualifications for the job... but he ended up being valuable because of his, like, situational awareness. Imagine a bunch of single-minded fanon Ravenclaws poking at things that go boom, and put harry in there to go "uhh, that's about 2sec away from going boom".

*** I think Hermione has the better academic understanding of magic but sometimes lacks the intuitive or creative approach that might be necessary for that kind of work.

Harry has the opposite problem of seemingly having an intuitive feel for powerful or unusual magic but no real interest in the theoretical side of things.

If Harry got more serious about it or Hermione through her adventures got better at thinking outside the box then either of them would probably be great unspeakables.

** After the shit he's been put through my headcanon is that Harry probably would want nothing to do with the ministry and would do some sort of freelance work.

That poses a problem as Rowling only elaborates on a handful of careers, mostly in the ministry. The other implied jobs are small times merchants teachers, or specialists for Gringotts, and these seem to have a lower status than a Ministry job, judging by the disappointment when Tom Riddle went into the private sector.

How the fuck does the Wizarding Economy work?

*** To be real though, when you really look into it there isn't that much on how the Wizarding World actually functions (the sort of stuff you'd want JK Rowling to tweet out after the fact instead of how wizards and witches shit on the floor before toilets).

Where do they get food? What jobs are their besides the Ministry and Gringotts? Snape is a Potions Master, did he learn that at Hogwarts or is there some form of higher education? Same for every other professor, where did they master their crafts?

**** For the master thing, apparently there's a UK-US Disconnect, where a master is often just a high level teacher. Just as a Chemistry Teacher might also be called the Chemistry Master, so to is the Potions Master just the guy who teaches potions at Hogwarts.

American fans don't have this background and assume there must be some higher level of credentialing, and there might be, but N.E.W.T.s actually seem to be standard post secondary education with O.W.L.s constituting the general.

***** I don't know if that was true in the 90s, but it's not now. We would call the person in charge of the chemistry department 'the head of Chemistry'.

I, as a British reader, also expect that there is a higher level of education, because the basic schooling system lines up completely with a secondary school (years 1-5, with O.W.L. exams are analogous to years 7-11, with GCSE exams at the end), and sixth form (years 6-7 with N.E.W.T.s is like years 12-13 with A levels). Quite often, sixth forms are linked with a secondary school, and are usually on the same site.

Obviously in the real world, the next thing after sixth form is university, so I want to believe that there's some kind of magical equivalent, or at least another way of getting a magical degree level qualification.

****** There are 40 people in Harry's year. Wizards live an average of 137.75 years according to JKR. That means in Magical Britain there are 5510 witches and wizards approximately. Assuming that because of the war Harry's cohort was especially small and the following years were a baby boom to balance it, and assuming that some significant segment of the population doesn't go to Hogwarts you get a year size of maybe 100... 150 tops. We're talking a maximum population of 20,000 or so Wizards.

Given the size of each class it might not even be feasible for a university as we understand it to operate. You can take fairly high level positions like Auror and Healer and Curse Breaker with just N.E.W.T.s after all so the economic incentive is weaker. Either apprenticeships are more common or what post Hogwarts education does exist is international and draws on the worldwide Wizarding population rather than just Britain's. (The world supposedly only has 7 proper wizarding schools anyway.)

***** I get the idea of the person who teaches getting a title as soon as they start teaching a subject, but does that mean they don't qualify to at all (beyond NEWTS). It's the same premise of only being a Professor should you get a teaching position. I assumed that such a qualification may be an optional part of applying for a job at Hogwarts (hence: Lockhart and Umbridge) but can you imagine? Do they just base it on life experience?

Healing because he enjoys helping people and has a good work ethic. Two things very necessary for anything medical, imo.

** There were some fine examples of strange jobs for Harry after Hogwarts, though most of them were for comedic purposes: school bus driver, PI, wandcrafter etc.

Some of the things I think Harry would be suited for are definitely: a pre-school teacher or working with young kids (due to his upbringing); a journalist would fit his personality better in some ways than being an auror (and he would have that being better than Rita thing going on for him, motivation+++); I can see him being a stay-at-home-parent (same reason as the pre-school teacher); he could probably be a Gordon Ramsay-like potioneer (chef) if he had proper mentoring (he was stellar in Slughorn class with good directions from a book, imagine what he could do with proper guidance)...

Those are just off the top of my head. I'm sure we could find dozens more that would suit Harry if we really thought about it well enough.

**** Harry would be really good at that job. He has natural empathy, cares about people deeply, is very strict against wrongdoers and has a great sense of fairness. All of which are crucial when dealing with kids. He wouldn't let them walk all over him but would reach out to them and allow them to have the childhood he never had. It clicks. I agree.

Also JKR was stupid when she created the wizarding world, it just doesn't work. You can't have a functioning modern society without some form of pre-school. By 11 most kids are pretty formed already. If they were purely home-schooled, they would be totally unsuited for a school environment by the time they go to Hogwarts. Who would have taught them to operate in a regulated and hierarchical structure like Hogwarts is? Especially with magic, when your ails and wants can be fixed with a wave of your parent's wands?

** After the battle Harry just felt numb. Sure he smiled in the victory talks, cried during the memorials and went through the motions but it was just that.

Ginny could tell he wasn't truly there for her. She had a huge row over his lack of feelings anymore. Hermione had rattled on about shell shock and ptsd or something. All Harry knew was he felt numb to everything.

~~~~~~~~~~

It was during a visit to Hagrid where Harry felt awake again for the first time. The kind soul of Hagrid had seen the darkened eyes of Harry and tried to cheer him up the only way he knew how.

Harry rode Buckbeak over the forest feeling somewhat awake again. Not truly alive but mostly awake. It wasn't until he swooped down into the forest and accidentally ran into an acromantula that he woke up fully.

The short battle had lite the fire behind his eyes for the first time in what felt like years.

~~~~~~~~~~~

"Señor, we have found someone who will handle the lethifold problem for us! His rates are highly reasonable and can be here soon."

~~~~~~~~~~~~

Harry swung the Sword of Gryffindor from Buckbeaks back as they charged into the lethifold swarm. Patronus bursting from his left hand wand, sword in the other and sticking charm holding him in place. Buckbeak and Harry bellowed their war cries as they stormed forward.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Boy-Who-Lived.\\
Man-Who-Conquered.\\
Destroyer-Who-Protects.

Harry Potter had found his true lifes calling. Breaking the ranks of dark creatures throughout the world. Protecting those who cannot fend for themselves. If the occasional aspiring Dark Lord happened to be in his way they didn't stay that way for long.
