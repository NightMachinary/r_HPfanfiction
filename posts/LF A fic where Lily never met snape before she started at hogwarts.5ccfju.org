As the title says I'm looking for a fic where Lily doesn't meet Snape before starting at Hogwarts. If there are any parings, I would prefer if Lily and James still get together, but it's not 100% necessary.


** i want this also, but w/ sev/lily

** I wonder, what would that really change?

I guess Snape would have no reason to turn coat and might still be a legitimate Death Eater instead of a school teacher with bad tats?

I think a Snape without Lily would just be a Snape that's deeper into the dark side, or at least gets in with a bad crowd at a younger age. Probably. I don't know. There's not much that was redeemable about him except for the fact that his love for Lily had him trying to help the "Light" and eventually becoming sort of a good guy (but still a massive asshole).

*** Snape and Lily were friends for ages before Hogwarts, and Lily was his support. So imagine them not knowing each other, and then being sorted into 2 houses with animosity against each other. Its likely that not only will they not attempt to be friends, but might openly be enemies via the influence of the houses (Snape primarily).

This would likely lead to Snape being a full blown death eater, and the dominoes could go far beyond. Perhaps he never hears the prophecy. Perhaps he still hears it and James and Lily are killed but he doesnt become spy. Like creating ripples in a pond, the simple fact of him not having Lily as a friend and support structure early in his life and into Hogwarts might change a HUGE amount of the story.

*** them not meeting before school doesn't mean they'll never meet. that's why i think it'd be interesting- they can meet already knowing each other's position without the miscommunication in canon, and develop from there.
