The thing is, I read it some years ago. Didn't even finished it. And now I only want to find it because its making me go grazy that I cannot remember the name o where I read it. I need to find it to just calm my mind. I've been looking for it in the past week and i cant find it anywhere! The things that i can remember are: Its in the Marauders Era The protagonist is a girl and is James sister o cousin i think, and at the start they don't know that. She helps James to make Lily jealous, and in one part they practice kissing each other but they cant stop laughing and say something like "its like kissing a brother/sister" I think it is a Sirius love story, but i am not really sure. I also remember that she meets Voldemort (or Tom, i dont remember how she calls him) and he gives her a ring or THE ring (you know, the Peverell ring) and tells her to not take it off. Whe she rubs it he can feel hands rubbing his back. One night she is at his house/mansion/whatever and she cant sleep so she starts rubbing the ring and he comes to her bedroom to ask her whats wrong, she says something like "how do you now that i am awake?" And he says " i can feel that you are rubbing the ring" and blah blah, they end sleeping (like, sleeping for real not anything dirty) in the same bed. At the next morning they make sandwichs together. And then some aurors i thibk storm in the house and take her to the Potter's house. Then she starts fighting and screaming at Dumbledore i think... That's all i remember. Please, if someone knows the name of the fanfic please tell me. I think i read it in Quotev, but it could be FFtion. It was like 4 years ago so i am not sure where.
