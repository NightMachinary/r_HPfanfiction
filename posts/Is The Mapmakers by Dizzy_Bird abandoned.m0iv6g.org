does anyone know if the mapmakers is abandoned or if it's still being written? it was last updated in may. i really hope it's not abandoned; it's my favourite marauders era fic :)


** I'm the author and it's not abandoned! Haven't gotten as much written this past year as I would have liked due to, you know, the whole pandemic thing, but it will be updated eventually :)

*** thank you so much for the reply, i completely understand. i look forward to the update!! also thank you so much for your writing; i can't even read any other marauder fics anymore because the mapmakers is so well written and i basically class it all as canon now. i started rereading it as soon as i finished and you're a very very talented writer so once again thank you for your writing :))
