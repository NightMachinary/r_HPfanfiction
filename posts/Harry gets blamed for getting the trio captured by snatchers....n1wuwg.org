Way too many fics have Ron being blamed for abandoning Harry in DH. Are there any fics where Harry is blamed for getting them captured and getting Dobby killed? If only Harry had been less of an idiot with the Taboo..


** It is a short one shot and only spends two paragraphs on it but Ron definitely blames Harry since they lose Hermione in this case. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4530812/1/]]

** Not exactly what you're requesting but I do have a self rec that's centered around the taboo and how the Trio should have used it more effectively (with Ron taking a larger role in its conception) [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29808174][Breaking Taboo]]
