Mine is Snape bashing, Any story that bashes him i tend to enjoy. I especially enjoy the rare story with Dumbledore telling Snape to stop being a melodramatic man child and get over it.

Indi!Harry being smacked down is also something i always enjoy, The best is when he has just finished his rant to someone about jow important he is and then is told off like a toddler. I even like it if it's evil Dumbledore who does it.


** I'm a sucker for happy endings. Like woah you pulled that victory out of your ass and still live happily ever after while ignoring the deaths of everyone around you... Those are pretty great. Also I'm a sucker for MoD harry and most other tropes which can tie in with super!harry.

****** I can't give titles, but its safe to say that i've read most of the popular ones from previous posts, google docs and fanfic communities. So most probably less recommended ones and i won't mind re-reading the ones which have OP!harry or super!harry.

**** You know, I'm having a major PJO phase right now and I think I've seen maybe three crossovers at best where HP cast goes to America, it is always PJO cast to England. And from those three, I think all of them have baby Harry, not MoD Harry. Can you shoot some recommendations my way if it's not too much to ask?

  “The first group I sent over made the Avengers uncomfortable by thanking them constantly and asking for autographs. The next group stole things to sell on ebay. The group after that didn't even get through the front door because Stark's security system found something in their background that we missed. The fourth group left traumatized after cleaning out Thor's room, apparently the god had some beheaded poultry dripping blood into a bowl in there. Then after that every group I've left hasn't lasted more than three days because of some problem or another. I'm pretty sure one of those assholes has made it a game to scare my workers away.”“I don't think you're supposed to call the heroes of New York assholes.”Or, cleaning up after the Avengers involves more than just getting blood stains out of the carpet and most of them can't take the heat. Thankfully the Savior of the Wizarding has spent the last decade cleaning up after Death Eaters, so she's up to the task. Nothing, not pranks, bird corpses, or unidentified slime will keep her from cleaning up. This Fic is now complete!

****** A great example of a crossover MoD is Whispers in Corners. Other well known ones are Steve and the Barkeep and Of Wizards and Heroes, both MCU.

For a crack/comedy take, try The Crownless King, inspired by covid.

A classic non-crossover is Time To Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is, and is a reincarnation MoD fic.

I'm fairly sure that none of these include Death et all as entities, however (except perhaps of wizards and heroes). All of these have different takes on the trope.

  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...

What if Hermione chose Harry? What if Sirius reunited with someone special he thought was gone forever...and they got a second chance? Read on to find out!

Now, nearly a decade later, Regulus's world changes again when his brother is released back into his care- damaged but alive. Regulus can do nothing for Sirius's sanity now, but seeing his brother reminds him of who Sirius used to be. A fighter. A Gryffindor. A proud man. A good friend. A strong ally.A godfather.

**** Ugh, I hate, hate, /hate/ when authors pull contrived bullsh*t out of nowhere to prevent competent actions by the heroes from actually solving a problem. It's one of the most obnoxious forms of railroading; it's contrived and forced, and also strips away the characters' agency. If nobody's decisions actually matter unless it happens to further the preordained plot, it's the narrative equivalent of a still-life - nothing of any real consequence is happening.

** Death Eaters actually getting their due. Harry/Someone going around killing them all after the fights over/everything goes to hell is nice, but what I really like is when either the ministry cleans up and stops taking bribes, or ICW stepping in when Voldy starts risking the secrecy and cracking down properly.

Honestly, even a story where the ministry isn't so stupidly corrupt you wonder how it still works is good, even in serious fics the ministry can look like it's just come out of a wormhole from crackland.

I think that most real governments are incompitent and corrupt(The ones I don't think that way about, I don't know well, so I'm not judging), but I expect atleast an attempt to fight during what is essentially a civil war.

Like ones where he's Sorted into a different house or shakes hands with Malfoy or something and therefore makes different friends and everything pans out totally differently as a result, including his own character evolution.

Honestly anything by Lomonaaeren and DebsTheSlytherinSnapeFan is usually amazing. They have a bunch of different tropes and Debs books can be a little bit OP Harry but I usually enjoy them. They are slash parings. The first is Draco/Harry, the second is Tom Riddle/Harry. Lomonaaeren seems to favorite Draco and Harry but there is some different ones of hers where it's different parings. Saving Connor by LightningOnTheWave on FF.net is my all time favorite fanfic, it's incredibly long though so not for everyone. The rest are all on AO3.

  Mine is Snape bashing, Any story that bashes him i tend to enjoy. I especially enjoy the rare story with Dumbledore telling Snape to stop being a melodramatic man child and get over it.
#+end_quote

Ooh boy then are you in for a treat, it's not quite that but "consequence for cause" by Cambangst verges on this

The following is an excerpt that I consider to be the essence of the fic

SPOILERS AHEAD

Snape stomped across the room and stopped in front of Dumbledore's desk. "Potter and I loathe one another. That is never going to change. If the boy must be educated, why not set the task to Lupin or Moody? Someone he does not despise."

Something in the room changed. A palpable energy charged the air, like the hum of electricity before a lightning strike. In spite of his anger, Snape took half a step back.

"Why do you suppose he hates you so, Severus?" Dumbledore's voice was soft. Dangerous. Like the whisper of an assassin's blade.

Snape threw up his arms in frustration. "We both know very well why he's been made to hate me. The Dark Lord can never suspect the truth, otherwise your plans would be ruined. This is the role you've cast for me, Dumbledore."

The old man's expression remained impassive. "What you're describing, Severus, is a consequence, not a cause. You're more than clever enough to understand the difference. Why does Potter hate you?"

Snape spun around like a petulant youngster, no longer able to stomach the hard blue eyes that saw through him. "He blames me for the death of his parents."

"Shouldn't he?"

The younger man turned back to face the Headmaster, eyes blazing with anger. "That was your failing, Dumbledore. Not mine, yours!" His voice rose to a shout. "I gave you everything. Told you everything. Swore my life to you! On one condition." He pounded his fist against the great, wooden desk. "One condition only! That you would keep them safe!"

Dumbledore continued to regard him with a cold, steely calm. "Keep her safe," he quietly corrected. "You asked me to keep her safe. And once again, you confuse consequence for cause. Why did she require my protection? What compelled you to swear your life to me?" Snape's eyes fell to the floor. After several moments of painful silence, the Headmaster continued. "There's something I want you to know, Severus. I never told her how the Dark Lord came to know of the prophecy." The former Potions Master's head snapped back up, genuine shock filling his normally stony face. "I thought she'd already suffered more than enough anguish on your account."

The old man rose to his feet. His blue eyes burned with barely contained fury. "Lily Potter never knew that the boy she befriended as a little girl was the one who betrayed her to the Dark Lord." Snape fell back several steps, looking stricken, until he bumped into an overstuffed armchair and barely caught himself before he crashed to the floor. "Lily Potter died without knowing that boy tried to sacrifice her family to the Dark Lord in return for her life." Dumbledore slowly made his way around the desk. The air around him crackled with magic. "And Lily Potter rests peacefully without knowing how shamefully that boy has treated her son."

The Headmaster came to a stop in front of Snape, staring down at him with an expression of pure disgust. "Lily Potter will never have to carry those burdens. But you know how she would have felt about those things, Severus. How she would have felt about you. You know it every time you see her eyes, filled with hatred, on the face of her son. And so long as I'm alive, that is a burden you will never escape." He towered over Snape's cowering form for a few moments longer, eyes boring into the younger man, before turning away to face the window. "You have much to do tomorrow. Leave me. Go back to your dungeons. Sleep, if you're able."

Neither man spoke another word as Severus Snape hurried out of the Headmaster's office.

The author is really creative with the lore and worldbuilding of the Wizarding World in his fic that I just can't help but appreciate it. Sure, it's not perfect or anything. The story isn't super serious nor is it entirely lighthearted, but it is just plain entertaining to read.

Hogwarts and England are his, but satisfaction is fleeting when Harry Potter, who vanished during the battle, begins to appear in his dreams, fighting for survival in a frigid waste land.

  AU, HPTMR. Harry Evans is a lowly Dark Patrol wizard who's working hard to advance. He doesn't think much of Senior Undersecretary to the Minister Tom Riddle, but on the other hand, a one-night stand that lets them both get rid of tension seems like a good idea.

I love redemption arcs but I'm so into his character right now that even if he doesn't get redeemed exactly (because he would have so much work to do seeing as he started killing since he was 16) I'll still read it. Most fics I read have a toxic relationship which is expected, and I'm apparently totally okay with that! My current fave pairing is fem!Harry/Voldemort and there's no way that's normal in any universe so the work put into the fics to make their relationship bloom is amazing.

However I only like it when he's at least a little caring, like he shows adequate capability of love. The ones where he stays a manipulative narcissistic asshole get boring.

  Appetence--- defined as an attraction, a natural affinity, or an instinctive desire. A cosmic sort of bond that clouds the mind until all thought is consumed by that singular point of infatuation. When Voldemort divines what Harri Potter truly means to him all those years ago in the graveyard, a festering sort of obsession begins. His horcrux. A part of his split soul, crafted from his marrow, magic, and might--- his very own damning appetence. He knows what has been kept from him, what rightfully belongs at his side, and he wants her back.

** Political intrigue. It's been awhile since I've read any fanfics so I can't really remember any good ones off-hand, but I enjoy stories that try to explore and expand the political landscape of the world. I know a common complaint about these types of stories is how young adults/teens can't speak/think at the level commonly shown in those types of stories. Personally, I don't really care as I tend to ignore the age of characters in the actual stories and mentally picture them as whatever age they sound like; usually something like 16-21, sometimes even older.

Everyone else just keeps pussyfooting around him and keeping things from Harry and coddling him. Snape is the only who will tell it to Harry straight, that it's time to grow up, get serious about your studies, and plan/train on how to defeat Voldemort. Snape and Harry become the real A team because everyone else is so incompetent or a liar.\\
I also like the same scenario where Snape and Hermione become the A team instead and save Harry from his own uselessness. Sometimes DD is a helper to the A team, sometimes he's not because he's already dead, and sometimes he's just a mollycoddling liar.

Sadly, they are extremely rare to find the type that I like. Most are just a/b/o drarry or fenrir/harry tropefests (those I really don't like).

(Another guilty pleasure of mine is reading about animaguses sexually experimenting. Do you know how bloody rare this is? Outside of pure smut fics and the abovementioned a/b/o tropefests (and even there) it's basically impossible to find a fic properly developing it.

If you were a kinky witch/wizard that liked to experiment and you were an animagus, you would damn well try seeing what having sex while transformed would feel like. Yet, I can barely remember more than 1 or 2 fics that mentioned that possibility. Are there so few furries writing hp fanfiction?)

** Dark but not like pure evil Harry and with Draco/Harry ship. Good but still dark Draco. Same with Snape. Basically good slytherins.

I also loveeeeeee love love love veela fics. Usually Draco as the veela and Harry as the partner but I've read it flipped. Other creature fics too like vampire is nice! Or Phoenix!

Also let me just say like nearly any Draco/Harry by the author Lomonaaeren is life. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/1265079/Lomonaaeren]]

Love me some Dumbledore bash..and Ron bash. But I also like when the twins are on the dark side instead. I go for Hermione either way. She's fun both sides.

There's so much I enjoy. Harry getting picked up and raised by the Malfoys young..Harry coming into magic young, Harry saving Snape and Draco and putting some kind of life bond and having to bond with them and like the first threesome I ever read and I never thought I'd like that but the author did such an amazing job. Pretty sure that was Lomonaaeren lol

I also like after Voldemort has been killed and they are adults and then like something happens. Like there was one where a death eater cursed Harry and he could only speak lies or something and Draco was a healer. It was good. Real good. Love that.

I like when the whole series is rewrote too and Harry has a twin, parents alive, ect, who is suppose to be the chosen one and he's kinda just there kinda neglected, but he's actually the one who's the chosen one. Befriending slytherins and Hermione and everyone.

Ahhh, it's been a while..I need to read some fanfiction again.

I'm not good at categorizing my favorite fics (they're just in a single bookmark folder labeled HP FF), so I don't have any others off the cuff.

**** linkao3(A dealer not a Death Eater by Jaxon) is fic which starts with Snape and Lily in an established relationship, already years out of Hogwarts, and in which Snape is not a DE, but an illegal Potions dealer for Lucius Malfoy (who he doesn't know is a Death Eater) to make ends meet. You find out how that came to be later on. The style is perfect for the fic, but utterly unlike Potter, so it takes a while for one to adjust, but after that it's great. No bashing involved, and no whitewashing either. (Snape isn't a Death Eater, but that doesn't mean he isn't a huge ball of trauma and issues, he does some fucked up shit) He's different from canon in that he's a lot happier and doesn't have self loathing though. It's a very creative and entertaining portrayal of the first war. Very tense at times, with some nerve-wracking moments. If it weren't for the ship, I feel that it would be a fandom favorite.

linkao3(Puzzle by we_built_the_shadows_here) Any snily by this author is great, but this one is her masterpiece. She's the master of dysfunctional Snily. A true tragedy in every sense of the word, this story is /dark/, and will leave you full of emotion. Probably the darkest portrayal of Snape I've seen that doesn't slip into bashing at any point. Lily is also amazing here (she is in all my favorite snily, but here especially). The summary alone does it justice.

linkao3(Come Once Again and Love Me by laventadorn) Most of the bad snily tends to be Time Travel fics, where Snape goes back in time, and making him pursue Lily. In doing that they not only make Snape really creepy and skeevy but also misunderstand his character (no way would he do that). This story is different in that not just Snape but Lily also goes back in time, from the moment of their deaths to their sixteen year old bodies. They struggle to live in a world that they have both outgrown, being the only ones who kind of understand each other in a sense, and reconciling through that. /Excellent/ prose, and some very moving moments, especially at the end.

linkao3(The Path Not Tread by BoxyP) a long, slow burn, for want of nail character study. It's an AU where the point of divergence is Snape letting slip that Sirius set him up for death during the arguement him and Lily had in canon before their friendship ended. Lily confronts Dumbledore asking why, and after he calms her down and explains, he grows interested in Snape, who might not be a lost cause after all, and whom he could use as his in as a spy. He talks to him, and at the end of the conversation offers to teach him the Patronus, to try and recruit him. The POV's are Snape, Lily, the marauders, Regulus. The author really gets into the head of each of them. She also has a lot of side stories set in the same universe, including a whole rewrite of the original books in progress, with the consequences of the changes in the AU.

linkao3(Aim & Ignite) this one isn't quite the same as the others, as the snily is more of a plot device than anything else, but I included it because it's very good and technically fits the bill. A girl!Harry severitus, where Lily didn't immediately accept James proposal (because she thought they were too young, /not/ because she didn't love him) and they took a break. She had a one night stand with Snape because of some exceptional circumstance, and Snape made her obliviate him. The result was Ariel. After that it follows canon up until first year, where both find out the truth. Snape is not a happy camper. He's as dickish as in canon (I mean, not quite, in that Harry isn't a carbon copy of James, so he isn't a trigger, but still pretty assholish). The characterization of everyone is absolutely spot on, and Ariel is enough like Harry that she isn't brand new, but is different enough to be her own person. The gender switch is also very well executed. Again, no bashing of any character involved. Dumbledore in particular is perfect. I hope you can enjoy at least one of these!

A loving relationship with his best friend is the happily ever after that Severus has always dreamt of - but he should've realised that a formidable magical couple will always attract attention from all the wrong quarters. With Lord Voldemort infiltrating an ineffectual government, Muggleborn rights eroded, and Lily unable to work, their lives are left in peril.Lily adores her supportive boyfriend, despite his streak of darkness, and in this terrifying new world, she knows his illegal potions are the only thing keeping them afloat - but the pressure of being a second-class citizen pushes her towards the only people who accept her: Severus' sworn enemies.Haunted by his Cokeworth past, Severus is determined not to let history repeat - but can he evade the rich promises of Lucius Malfoy, the lure of the Death Eaters, and the seductive call of the dark arts?

#+begin_quote
  Sometimes all that's needed for enormous differences is a small change, as small as the order of a few sentences in a heated fight. Lily Evans unconsciously makes one such change while arguing with her best friend, and the magnitude of consequences her actions cause hold the potential to reshape not only herself and the people around her, but their world's very future. A What-if AU that explores the questions of how much we know ourselves, how much we're truly influenced by our surroundings and how much we do so in turn, whether unexpected consequences arising from the choices we make are our responsibility, and ultimately, whether truth is truly an objective axiom of existence, or only what we make of it.

Also fics where Harry basically says "screw this!" and leaves (or at least mentally checks out). With or without friends.

** Not a big fan of character bashing stories. I love stories with Ron being more awesome and funny like canon Ron but those are so hard to find. I really like OC/Snape romances where he's still a sarcastic bastard, but not abusive. Give me that sarcasm and black sense of humor. Those have gotten super hard to find, the really good ones were mostly written before Half Blood Prince came out where he killed Dumbledore and fans later got the revelation about Lily. Also some Severitis fics, basically in the end I want to read fics with a lot of character growth and he can be a fun character to read about because he has so much growth to go through, lol.

Crossovers are my other big thing. I love crossovers and seeing how people put two worlds together. Right now am on a Naruto/Harry Potter kick, but if anyone has recommendations for good ones of HP crossed with any fandom I'd love to see them.

  Warnings Inside. Dumbledore ought to have known better than to leave an orphaned Harry Potter in the hands of the Dursleys. A twist of fate has the boy-who-lived living with criminals. Sly, cunning, street-smart, sorted into Slytherin where his housemates have been raised to hate him, will Harry survive? Or maybe it's the House of Snakes that doesn't stand a chance.

Harems. Harry with older witches. But if you go there, please have him be at least sixteen. Preferably eighteen or older. 14 year old boy getting it on with women in their 40's is... wrong.

Harry going through the veil and ending up in a different world. Not necessarily a crossover. Can be an original world.

Harmony. Still kinda pissed this ship didn't happen in canon.

Bella/Andie/Narcissa reunited. Bella and Narcissa redemption stories. Bonus if they end up with Harry.

Swords. Different kind of magic. Body modification.

** Bashing! I don't mean critical, mild, or anything of that. I mean over-the-top, who wrote this? why did they do this? EXTREME bashing. I mean OOC, I mean the character the author doesn't like IS THE DEVIL. They're written with so much passion. I can almost TELL the author is having fun while writing it. I don't even hate the characters I read about with bashing, I love Ron Weasley. I love Dumbledore. I love Hermione. I love the characters the fanfics I read bash. I'm reading for fun, believe it or not. The reason why I read Weasley bashing so much is not because I hate the Weasleys (the Weasleys are my favorite family in the series) it's because they are more fics of EXTREME bashing for that, so it's the market I go to. It's like, orange juice and water, there's a more market for water, so I get water. (on the contrary, I do love fanfics that portray Weasleys in a good light! Mostly Ron, because I love him so much and his friendship with Harry is just- amazing.)
