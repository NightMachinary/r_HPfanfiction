** That reminds me of an mausing prompt someone suggested, that was never finished: what if Bellatrix had been insane enough that the modified Gemino Curse on the Cup /never stopped/? Three months after the Trio's break-in at Gringotts, planet Earth is enterred in an increasingly thick pile of rapidly-modifying Hufflepuff's Cups. Society has collapsed along with the Statute of Secrecy, and now wizards (some of whom now live in floating cities /above/ the rising level of cups) comprise most of the survivors, desperately looking for how to cancel the spell.

  A year has passed since the dead started returning to life. The fate of those hoping to survive and rebuild rests on the best and the worst of humanity, both wizards and Muggles, with their political ideologies and the ravenous undead in between, and it's up to Healer Harry Potter to save as many as he can in the crossfire. A Harry Potter Zombie Apocalypse Fanfiction. HP/AG.

  Dumbledore's dead. On the train ride home, cars are at a standstill, the electricity is out, fires burn unchecked from Scotland to London, and chaos reigns in muggle Britain. Somehow Harry has to survive this new world while destroying Voldemort.

** I have a 14k draft that is essentially this (it's technically a RWBY crossover, but you don't need to know anything about the other fandom to read it).

Google Doc Link because I haven't published it yet, but most of what's there is of decent quality. [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/11BavEaWw_RkecGkWo6lvye5yBc2nEZrbXDH796dw5Bg/edit#bookmark=id.5y8slkj5l0me]]

** I don't know that I'd call it Apocalyptic, necessarily, but in linkffn(Emperor by Marquis Black) Harry (and his family) pretty much trigger WWIII and cause a collapse of all governing bodies in the world (or, perhaps, just Europe. I can't remember).

#+begin_quote
  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.
