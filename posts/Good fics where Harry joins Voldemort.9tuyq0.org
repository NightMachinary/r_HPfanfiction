*** Just a heads up on November 3rd author started a few month hiatus in the middle of the sequel (which is only a different story to preserve the softer rating of the prequel but for all intents and purposes they should otherwise be treated as one story) so don't read this if you want a completed story

** I'm writing one now, but I'm waiting until it is finished to post it. Here is a rough draft of the summary.

To protect his friends Harry is forced to join the Dark Lord. Taken from Britain to a far away land, Harry shall find the markets of the Ottoman empire have more to offer than pomegranates and figs, djinns and slaves. Amidst new friends, cultures and creatures, he becomes a centerpiece between two brothers fighting over the throne and discovers magic he could only dream of.

Linkffn(Lindsiria) is the old version. I've been updating my profile with my progress.

  Harry Potter was known to be brave, daring and self-sacrificing. He would do anything to protect his friends --- even consorting with those he once hated and testing his very integrity. In one fateful moment, this idea is tested, pushed to the limit... 6/11/18 BEING REWRITTEN. POSTING WHEN FINISHED. Chap 9/18 completed.
