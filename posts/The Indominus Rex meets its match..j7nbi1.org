The bloody and titanic battle was nearing its climax.I was winning, I always win. I could feel the plan of the little traitor who tried to guide me to the water that smells of danger ... silly traitor.The arrival of the female who smells a bit like me was unexpected but useless in the long term, I can feel her despair when she sees that her little plan fails, the fear that emanates from both twoleggers is the sweetest thing I have ever tasted.Suddenly I can feel it, we are no longer alone. Everything burns, from the heavens a torrent of ... fire? descend on me. And then I hear it, a roar that promises blood and death. Death from above. The Hungarian Horntail has arrived.


** the horntail will win from what we've heard about them. The horntail can fly around and blast fire at indominus rex but it can't fight back since it can't fly. Fun Fact : Horntails are Wyverns, not dragons.

*** Right because their wings are their forelegs. That is actually true.

Still maybe the true dragons had been hunted to extinction and the Wyverns which are now called dragons are actually the bastardized version of the TRUE Dragons!

MAY THEY RISE AGAIN!!
