When I first got into fanfiction I pretty much stuck to serious ones and some romance but have eventually broadened my horizons. I never really read any comedy except for a few one shots. That was until I read A Black Comedy. I have to say it will forever be one of my favorites. The only other thing comparable I would say is the Lie I've Lived & Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion. Is there anything else out there in the comedy genre that is even close to these three amazing fics?


** Linkffn(oh god not again by sarah1281) this doc is hilarious. It's time travel but Harry just decides to fuck around. He actually becomes nevilles boggart instead of snape. Also linkffn(seventh horcrux) you've probably read this one but I only found out about it a couple months ago and I loved it.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

** Linkffn(runic animagi by kassien) if you've ever wanted Harry and dobby to smoke dope together then this is for you. It is a romance fic but that comes in much later the first half is Harry fuckin around (literally and figuratively) and smoking door and getting some tats.

** If you ignore the Hat in TLIL, the story has no actual humor at all, unless you laugh at how badly it has aged, which I admit, is hilarious.

Anyways, I digress. The funniest fic I've ever read is linkffn(whatever happened to bromance). While it's only 3 short chapters, it's chock full of amazing one-liners.

Something a bit longer that I found amusing: linkffn(8197451)

** A lot of stuff by Rorschach's Blot is enjoyable. He's not the best technical writer, but he has great ideas.

linkffn(Make A Wish by Rorschach's Blot) is probably his most well known and is the beginning of a series of fics. linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes by nonjon) is by the same author as A Black Comedy and quite good as well. Firefly crossover, so be forewarned.

*** Rorschach has always been an idea guy, and honestly almost all of his ideas are amazing. Recently his writing (perhaps his editors') quality has increased greatly (see his latest) and I can't imagine how awesome Make A Wish would have been had he had that quality then. His story is one of the very few (and only off the top of my head) that gives Harry a box of tools to tackle any problem yet doesn't come off as Gary Stu Destroys the World.

The plot happens around Harry as he explores an interesting and exciting magical history that Rorschach and the Yahoo group integrated very well with real life historical events. While the multiple author/omake format can be frustrating and/or confusing, I think it works out okay. The best part of the whole thing is that no matter what The Professor and Henchgirl come up with, absolutely nobody asks if they can really do that with magic. They just do it. And it's cool.
