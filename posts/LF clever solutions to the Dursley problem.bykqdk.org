So, Harry can't use a wand but what about: potions (either to make himself go hulk, or make them be less problematic) magical artefacts (invisibility cloak+ cricket bat?) or magical creatures ( snakes, elves or that huge spider lee Jordan has).

Any fics where Harry gets creative and does something?

  Harriet Potter finds a trunk in her Aunt and Uncle's attic and finds a book called the Marauders Compendium along with her mother's diary. And from that, she learns way too much about potions...In which, Harriet Potter is the Neville Longbottom in this universe, and she learns how to prank fantastically well. And uh, Neville Longbottom is off saving the world and what-have-you. (We don't really focus on him that much.)
