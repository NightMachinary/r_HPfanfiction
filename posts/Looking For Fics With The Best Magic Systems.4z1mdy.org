Looking for fics with the best/most interesting magic system.

Please keep story over 70k+ words!


** As you can probably tell from my list I'm a very big fan of the way the canon magic system works. What You Leave Behind, Forging the Sword and Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived all explore the intricacies of the canon magic system wonderfully. Harry Potter and the boy who live also has my favorite renditions of the animagus transformation and occulmency learning process.

Ectomancer has a interesting magical system dealing with spirits, wand crafting and wandless magic it's probably what I would recommend most out of this list. Prince of the Dark Kingdom mostly deals with the fey and gods. While Magics of the Arcane has a interesting system of chants. I also would have recommended the Unfound Door, but it's unfortunately only 61 thousand words long.
