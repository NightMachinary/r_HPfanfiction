Just seen this post: [[https://lulusketches.tumblr.com/post/130277985775/still-not-over-it]]

I want fics where Harry and Albus are friends/close comrades.

I know [[http://ff2ebook.com/download.php?source=fhcom&id=7139183&filetype=epub][HP and the Primes of Merlin]] (epub), probably linkffn(13388022) and maybe linkffn(The Merging by Shaydrall). Anything else?

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

** There's the one that wanders a bit that I can't quite recall the name of. It's a Harry-Luna fic (I think?) and it's relatively well known in the same vein as Cadmean Victory. Has a scene towards the beginning with them walking down some heavily trapped stairs in a ruin somewhere.
