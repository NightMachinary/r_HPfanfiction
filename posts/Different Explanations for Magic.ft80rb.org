So, I'm of the opinion that magic operates on non-natural-science-ey laws. Where biological evolution is Darwinian, magical evolution might be Lamarckian (the more your family uses a specific type of magic, the better disposed your family is to it, for example); perhaps transfiguration minds are divided between an atomic view and an Aristotelian Hylomorphic perspective, or perhaps they're monists that believe everything is made of only one substance and transfiguration simply changes the form; perhaps Occlumens are divided between those who see an emotional-control explanation, a memory-manipulation explanation, or a will-imposed explanation.

That's what I'm curious about - what different explanations for magic that Magicals might have. I imagine the study of Magic to be more like that of Psychology (with tinges of Mythological and Literature analysis) where the same phenomenon can be understood and explained from a myriad of different perspectives that all have some experimental basis than Physics or Maths where things tend to have singular explanations (the non-bleeding edge stuff, anyway - I know people are still debating over explanations at the String-Theory level of Theoretical Physics). Which is what I'm looking for: what explanations might the Magical World have?

Feel free to cover any type of magic, any specific spell, potions, runes, wards, etc. Whatever. I'm mostly just curious as to what the collective fandom can come up with. It's fun to see people theorise and debate stuff like this. :)

Though, I would recommend you mark whether you're trying to be canon or fanon compliant. It might help deter some arguments. :D

*** That is interesting. Very Mass Effect (that's how they explain their Blue-Space-Magic Biotics, an element in the body allowing them to manipulate dark energy fields).

** I'm not good at explaining stuff but here's the gist of idea I once read.

So there's free energy like a net of energy that the universe has and wizards or anything magical can tap into this and becomes a kind of conductor. they can tap into this and create distortion by adding or removing in the system.

Anyway, the sciencey stuff tell that the parallel plane is separated from our world and that this "leakage" of gravitons from the brane(stuff that separate the planes) into higher-dimensional space causes distortion (I'm pretty sure I got stuff wrong) thus things don't seem to be mathematical consistent and stuff.

*** Huh. Kinda reminds me of a mix of The Weave from D&D and the Platonic Overrealm from Laundry Files (in that I have only a vague idea of what all that mathsy-physics stuff means).

** [[https://i.4pcdn.org/tg/1553449399513.pdf]] - here's some guy's doctoral thesis on canon magic.

â€‹

Personally, I agree with most of it except for a few aspects such as authority. Magic absolutely is not an energy, it definitely overrides mundane nature (literally confirmed by Rowling) and muggles would be destroyed by wizards in a heartbeat. Magic in canon is conceptual.

*** I admit, I completely disagree that Muggles would be destroyed by Wizards in a heartbeat, but the concept of conceptual magic sounds interesting. Could you elaborate?

**** Alright, well let me elaborate on why Muggles would be destroyed by Wizards in a heartbeat. There are simply too many concessions that have to be made in a scenario where Muggles win. I think as I make an argument, it'll reveal how magic in canon is conceptual (obvious example would be Gamp's law btw)

A president is "made to forget" a phone call to the British Prime Minister for an impromptu meeting between Fudge and the Prime Minister. Other aspects of magic aside, you know what we would call espionage on this level in the muggle world? Flawless.

Concession 1 - Despite the wizarding world having clear control over Muggle government, muggle governments and other political powers are capable of acting against wizards. Concession 2 - Enough of the muggle world finds out about magic, and decides that military action against wizards is actionable. Okay, but what are they going to act against? Muggle-repelling charms, unplottable charms, other magical protections keep muggles from even noticing, much less targeting wizarding locations. Here is an example of canon magic being conceptual. The unplottable charm relies on the concept of a map. /Any map/ cannot display that which is unplottable.

Concession 3 - Despite muggles not noticing people waltzing around in train stations being blatant wizards, and canonical evidence as to the strength of muggle-repelling charms, muggles somehow manage to target a wizarding location. Maybe they nuke London, deciding that an insane amount of civilian casualties is worth killing a part of the wizarding population. They target Diagon Alley flawlessly. A nuclear missile is launched (despite the implausibility as this requires plottability), and it flies in a clean path. A ballistic nuclear warhead detaches flying straight towards its target. It enters Diagon Alley (possibly not even this - I'll elaborate later) and promptly smashes into Gringotts, killing a few unfortunate goblins. Why didn't it detonate? Magic interferes with electricity and nuclear warheads rely on electricity. Since nuclear warheads cannot confirm that they're supposed to detonate without their electrical functions, well, functioning, they won't detonate because of failsafes.

Concession 4 - A nuke goes off. Well it's not going to do that much. Wizards have enhanced reflexes (stated many times in the books), enchanted protections (commonly called wards) and other mechanisms. /But oh my god so much energy is in a nuke?! How on earth could a wizard defend against a nuclear missile?/ Well that is decidedly muggle thinking. First of all, magic is not energy. As such, it cannot be compared to the theories of energy muggles have developed. We know from JK Rowling that magic overrides mundane nature. The greatest threat to magic is other magic. Concession 5 - Magic can be treated as an energy and does not override mundane nature. Alright, well still doesn't matter. You know how much energy is implied in transfiguration or conjuration? A whole lot. Having established that magic is obviously capable of generating the "energy" to stop a nuke under this unlikely scenario, let's look at some other factors. Radiation and heat are often named as things that would bypass a protego. Again, this fails to consider the conceptual nature of magic. A protego defends against harm (except for Avada Kedavra - again reaffirming that magic is vulnerable to magic only). Radiation and heat clearly fall under concepts of harm.

Concession 5 - Wizards cannot defend against nukes with shield-like protections. Cushioning charm, arresto momento, flame-freezing, and apparate away.

Concession 6 - Cushioning charms, momentum halting charms, and flame-freezing charms don't work on nukes. Well the light still reaches you before the shockwave so that's plenty of time to apparate under a wizard's reflexes.

The next part of an argument for muggles would typically involve guns. For this, there's the concession again of concession 3v2. Protego. Concession 4v2 - It doesn't work cause "bullets are too fast" (disregarding the faster than one could see casting of magic in the books). There's enchanted protective clothing. Concession 5v2 - Bullets can't be stopped by shields. Alright well you have the imperturtable charm to repel bullets. Again stating that bullets would not be repelled similar to the dungbomb's is muggle thinking. Magic is conceptual and repels any object all the same. Just repelling an object contravenes muggle's models of the world.

Let's say that ultimately, Muggles can kill wizards. Wizards can still apparate, something muggles can do nothing over. Even in a scenario where many of the concessions apply, and a nuke devastated the ministry of magic, wizards would only have to regroup to destroy muggles. Like it or not, canonically muggles would lose to wizards. Why? Magic is conceptual and overrides mundane nature.

***** Heh. You sound mildly irritated - did you post this on a bad day or is this just an argument you have to make often? :D

Apologies for the delay in response, incidentally. I wanted to look into a few things you've said and make sure I had some good questions.

Before I actually attempt to rebut, I'd like to ask a few clarifications, if I may (they may appear to be phrased like criticisms, but I assure you they aren't and I'm just trying to understand your points further - I haven't been sleeping well recently and my brain is struggling to phrase things well). Perhaps I do have this wrong, after all.

Regarding your 'faster than one could see casting', I'm assuming that means you're taking the latter 'Rule of Cool' battles version of Rowling's Magic 'System' that allowed Harry to cast Sectumsempra without knowing pronunciation or purpose rather than the initial 'Pronunciation and knowing what you're doing is vital', then?

Because if you still had to 'say' the incantation (in your head for silent casting or verbally for non-silent), then that's still at least a second or so to speak then swish and flick (wingardium leviosa, for example) and not as instantaneous as you seem to think.

How are you defining 'concepts'? Is this some platonic overrealm where 'map' means the same thing to everyone or is it reliant on the concept of 'map' in the mind of the caster? And if it is the latter, then how are those concepts associated? Does harm mean maiming, killing, burning, etc? (also, interesting aside, is this why Hogwarts is so dangerous? To teach kids to make associations with as many dangers as possible in order to get their shield spells up to snuff? :D).

eg. A Modern Muggleborn casts the spell, knows about Sat-Navs and such and counts them as maps, but a Wizard casting it back in a thousand AD would have a more 'conceptual' concept of maps (they were strictly representative back then, not descriptive - more for teaching and demonstrating than navigation). Does satellite imaging count as an image or a map? Also, if Hogwarts is unplottable on the concept of maps, why does the Marauder's Map work?

Same with Harm. Wouldn't that depend on what the Caster's concept of harm was? Hence why the stink-bomb went through a shield charm and the glass Dumbledore repels in the Atrium didn't (also 'repels any object all the same', but doesn't repel stink-bombs?) - it wasn't perceived as 'harm'. So, if you're aware of bullets and know they're 'harm', then they'd be stopped, but otherwise they wouldn't be? And surely if it was conceptual, the Killing Curse would be the ultimate example of the 'Harm concept'?

And how would the unplottable spell be implemented when locations are removed from maps? Given that we have now mapped the entire planet, would a conceptual removal of places from maps just lead to blank spaces we don't see or would it replace those spaces with land like it was never built (and incidentally, Hogsmeade is canonically plottable, so they'd see the village easy and apparently Muggles see the Castle as ruins - see Hermione's lines in GoF for that one).

And does it prevent them from knowing the location at all, or just from finding it? eg. "Hey disenfranchised Muggleborn, here's some money and a job you can't get in the Magical World, do you know what's next to Diagon Alley? And hey, isn't that Hogsmeade place plottable? And isn't it right next to Hogwarts? What's that ruined castle over there? Isn't Hogwarts a castle?"

Ah, and there's another question - politics. Do you see Muggleborns as siding with the Ministry or with the Muggles? Does this attack take place before, during, or after the war? Could a bomb/nuke from inside the protections cause harm?

What's the range of the 'interferes with electricity' effect? Is it absolute (cast spell, no electricity) or random (cast spell, lights flicker and sometimes turn off, sometimes not)? Given that the areas around Diagon Alley and St Mungos aren't a wasteland, there are people living there in London and I highly doubt anyone would be willing to live in a place with no Electricity in London of all places, I've always thought that's one of Rowling's more iffy attempts at worldbuilding, but I'll play along with it.

I haven't read the books in awhile, but googling doesn't seem to find anything about enhanced reflexes. Could you provide a citation or something for that, please? But even reactions can't make up for lack of awareness, no? A sniper team with a suppressor shooting from a mile away, the bullet would hit before the sound did - and since they tend to operate in eight-man teams with four shooters, that's four people at once. And we have a lot of Snipers - if you go with Rowling's semi-canonical 'there are 3000 wizards in Britain' line, then I'm pretty sure we have about as many snipers as they have people.

And on that note, how many Magical combatants (with experience of being shot at) are you envisioning? As any soldier will tell you, a warzone with guns and bombs is a very stressful place - they have to be conditioned to run towards those things where the normal people run away from them. Spells are quiet, aside from the people yelling incantations, where Muggle weaponry is loud and distracting (possibly to the point where an apparating Wizard could be distracted enough to splinch themselves, no?).

And regarding protective clothing - I'm assuming you're referring to the shield hats the Weasley Twins made because most of the Ministry couldn't cast a decent Protego? I don't remember anything else featured in the books, so please do clarify if I'm forgetting something. How long would those last? Do they reduce with each 'hit', so to speak?

To summarise - I don't doubt that magic is more powerful, but my questions all seem to be about the point of failure being where it always is - in people. But I am a psychologist, so it's the lens I see most things through. :D

I also apologise for how garbled some of the order of this is. Like I said, I'm low on sleep. I just wanted to respond before I forgot to or accidentally clicked 'mark all as read' again. :D
