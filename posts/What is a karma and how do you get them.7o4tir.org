** The real question is why you would ask this on HPfanfiction subreddit of all places instead of using Google, or askreddit, or the FAQ to figure it out. I am actually impressed people are being this nice about it. I guess HPfanfiction isnt all fic bashing, character bashing, and downvoting ;)

** It is rating. Someone upvotes your post or comment, you get karma.

Or Someone downvotes and you lose it. Which will totally happen if this question was in FAQ

** Karma means votes. Some kids belive Downvote means disagree. They downvote everything that they dislike.

Upvote means comment was relevant to question or topic.

How do you get it?

Karma-whoring! Sometimes it includes things like indulging in cheap ass puns, suck Old man's metaphorical ass, riding Most useless character's (Ron) metaphorical dick.

Observe how I will lose Karma for speaking Truth.
