I'm looking for a fic where luna is a plain old conspiracy theorist and not some kind of seer or other fanon portrayal. Where Rotfang conspiracy is like Illuminati, wrackspurts are like 'aliens'. Where Sirius was actually Stubby Boardman but was replaced by lizard people.

As long as it is about a Luna that isn't an all knowing person but a conspiracy theorist that has unique insight to people and is often spot on in assessment that makes you wonder if they are really out to get you.


** I'm trying to do this and it's weirdly difficult.

Real conspiracy theorists seem to be motivated by a desire to regain power in a world where they have none, and are invariably angry and arrogant with nonbelievers. Luna shows no sign of really any of those (feeling powerless, getting angry outside of defending her dad, feeling like she's better than other people for believing the "right" things). Any attempt to match her up with any conspiracy theorist dialogue I can find online is bizarrely OOC when Luna is very nice. I'm thinking of just making her extremely loyal to Xeno and having him be more arrogant than we really see in canon but that doesn't really feel right either.

*** Xeno Lovegood was shaking as he read the Daily Prophet. "Do you see this, Luna?! The bloody dwarves are at it again! No amount of muggles could dig that deep into the ground. It's not possible! The muggles at the so-called 'mines' are plants, they /must/ be. The dwarves... good Lord, they're threatening the statute of secrecy!"

He crumpled the paper and threw it violently into the fireplace, where it joined a growing pile of newspapers. He hadn't used the fireplace in nearly two weeks, due to the fact that Floo Powder was cancerous; yet another crime against wizardkind by the Rotfangs. He leapt out of his seat.

"Luna!" He barked, hesitating as she startled in her chair. "Sorry about that," he said more softly, "it's just... could you fetch me some more ink for the press? We're running a bit low."

Luna gave him a cheery salute, set down her knitting needles, and attempted to gracefully flow through the piles of paper clippings that littered their household. She accidentally stubbed her toe on his scale model of Polypus, and hopped her way out of the room with a few hissed words.

Xeno tried to relax. It seemed that every day, the world became dimmer, bleaker, more black and white. Since the death of his wife, he had lost control of his life in bits and pieces. Now, he was the laughingstock of the journalism community, simply because he could read through the lines. He /tried/ to warn them. Oh, he tried.

He nearly wept with exhaustion as he sank back into his well-worn chair. Burying his face in his hands, he pulled himself back together.

/'Do it for Lunabear, old boy,'/ he thought /'If the world is informed, they will be more cautious, and Luna will be safe.'/

Hearing his daughter come back to his study, he straightened his posture and pasted a happy looking smile on his face. He felt like it was made of clay, brittle and ready to crack.

"Ah, Luna! Wonderful, sweetheart, simply wonderful."

She smiled back at him as she set the ink down, but he could see she was worried.

"What's wrong, Luna?"

Luna looked to the side and wrinkled her brow. "Sorry, Daddy, but... are we going to be okay? If the dwarves get the muggles on their side, wouldn't the Rotfangs alert their vampire cabal and try to stop them using their wicked dark powers? What if they start a war with the magical world?"

She looked scared. Xeno felt a cold chill down his spine at her words, but... he couldn't allow her to become as cynical as he had. She was joy, she was hope, and in his life, she was all that he had left of either.

"Not to worry, darling," he lied with a grin, "I'll ring up my contacts, and I'll start work on this next paper. People will be warned, and rational, informed magicals will stop things from going too far. I promise, good will save the day yet again!"

He felt like a bastard. There were no contacts. Goodness had never saved the day. Every time she thought it had were lies upon a mountain of lies. But he wouldn't, /couldn't/ allow the light of his life to dim.

Luna nearly sagged with relief. "Daddy," she said softly, "I don't say this much, but... you're my hero. There's not a single wizard in the world who works as hard as you do to keep us all safe. How do you do it?"

His heart broke as he winked at her, trying to keep the tears from his eyes. "Hard work and good luck, love. Speaking of, why don't you go work on your assignments, hmm?"

Luna walked out of his study with her back straight and head held high, proud of her father. She started whistling a cheery marching tune, imagining people all over the country waiting desperately to hear from the Great Xenophilius Lovegood, for information that would keep the larger (and unfortunatley ungrateful) Wizarding World safe.

She worked hard on her studies, envisioning the day when her father would /really/ let her help with his secret work.

Downstairs, the great Xenophilius Lovegood burned a pile of newspapers and drank heavily.

** To pull this off convincingly I think you'd have to change Xeno's character as well. Make him into an Alex Jones type of figure (which would be hilarious if done well) and I think that could work.

** All my yes!

Canon Luna is way more interesting than the fanon variants with the author-channelling wisdom, and so is the world she lives in: the existence of magic should never mean that all superstitions are actually right.

I love to see her as a girl who loves and supports her dad by trying to spread around his beliefs, which are also hers because she's a vulnerable kid with no scientific training. She's way more aware than she lets on, though: the creative interpretation of reality is just the only way of bonding she's ever known, and active self-delusion helps her deal with the bullying while avoiding confrontation. "If you believe it hard enough, it will become true", says magical thinking, and she has no reason to believe otherwise. As she grows more confident, learns about the real world and finds friendship, more and more of this becomes her just trying to find real beauty and mystery and /magic/ behind the dull, tangible everyday magic... and, well, messing with her friends.

I'm aware this isn't necessarily canon, and I'd love to read more interpretations... just not of the Luna-knows-all-and-has-no-personality kind.

*** I'll be honest, but I find it fucking disgusting that people find it necessary to justify Luna's quirks. There is no need to treat her as a special little snowflake like some kid with magical autism that sees what other people can't. Honestly, it pisses me of that her presence must be explained as a girl misunderstood with seer powers or magic sight. Unless it's plot relevant, there's no reason to treat her any less like that bullied kid that wears weird clothing to ward off evil or believes that big foot and nessie actually exist. She's not mentally ill or disabled, she's a brutally honest and not a shy awkward person but rather a very confident and self assured one. A person who gives wise words or life lessons and has a unique understanding of people.

She's that weird kid in class that believes in aliens, Trump is lizard person but I'd hang out with her since she's a nice a fun person to be around despite her telling you that the moon landing is staged. Such beliefs rarely come up in conversation and would usually be 'did you know' type of greeting but that doesn't mean it's all they talk about. There is no reason to change just to be pixie dream girl.

It's RUDE that people feel the need to justify her presence or being friends with the golden trio. That she has to be something more.

**** I agree that it is a tad sad that people feel the need to change her when she's perfect as she is.

I would definitely go into many hour long arguments over the burden of proof and when it is reasonable to believe something, but I think I would fall apart the second she gives me a sad look. 0

****** Well, fics should only change stuff from canon for a reason (premise of the fic), or as a consequence of in-fic actions. Changing a character for no in-universe reason but for some other sake in an unnecessary way is rather poor practice - it's will be either some form of glorification or bashing of the canon counterpart.
