couldnt the golden trio, ya know, just summon the horcruxes?


** I would imagine the anti-summoning enchantment was probably invented about a week after the summoning charm was, for obvious reasons.

  "We couldn't. . . we couldn't just try a Summoning Charm?" Harry said, sure that it was a stupid suggestion. But he was much keener than he was prepared to admit on getting out of this place as soon as possible.

  "Certainly we could," said Dumbledore, stopping so suddenly that Harry almost walked into him. "Why don't you do it?"

  "Me? Oh. . . okay. . . " Harry had not expected this, but cleared his throat and said loudly, wand aloft, "Accio Horcrux!"

  With a noise like an explosion, something very large and pale erupted out of the dark water some twenty feet away; before Harry could see what it was, it had vanished again with a crashing splash that made great, deep ripples on the mirrored surface. Harry leapt backward in shock and hit the wall; his heart was still thundering as he turned to Dumbledore.

  "What was that?"

  "Something, I think, that is ready to respond should we attempt to seize the Horcrux. "

*** "So I summon the Horcrux and you conjure a cage or barrier for that thing."

And the greatest wizard of Britain easily dealt with the monster while Harry summoned the Horcrux, which was a fake.

**** Idk if you're serious or not, but the horcrux didn't move from the basin. Harry tried to touch it while it was in there, but couldn't. I doubt very much that Voldemort would place a deadly curse on one and place another in an enchanted basin full of a hallucinogenic with an invisible barrier surrounded by inferi in cave on a rock that was damn near impossible to reach and forget about a summoning charm. He's arrogant, but not so stupid.

***** But the horcrux inside isn't real. So while the real horcrux is obviously immune to it, it's possible that the fake one isn't.

****** But Harry and Dumbledore don't know that nor do they know which one it might be, so "accio locket" is out of the question and as "accio horcrux" didn't work, they had to go get it.

** Assume they can't for the same reason Harry can't summon the golden egg in the first task, his hostage in the second, or the cup in the third.
