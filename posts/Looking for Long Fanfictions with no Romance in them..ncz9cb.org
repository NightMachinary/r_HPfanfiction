I am sick of the bottomless pit that is shipping so i am looking for fanfictions with no romantic pairings (except maybe canon ones but only as background and not a vital part of the story). Preferably no bashing or too out of character main characters.


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life]]

This is a very good AU story with no bashing and no romance.

  Harry had never really properly planned anything before. The fact that his first ever plan was risky and filled with assorted dangers was not actually deterring him as much as it should. (This story explores how Harry's third year at Hogwarts might have played out differently if a little project management and an ambitious plan had been thrown into the mix.)

** There are some, and yes there is too much romance (and particularly sex) in HP fanfictions, but to be honest, these stories are about teenagers, and in that age romance and boy-girl relationships are quite a big deal, so it is reasonable that it is represented in stories about them.

  Charlie Weasley's classmate Aaron disappeared in 1991; vanishing while the magical world was locked in turmoil. Aaron is presumed dead until 1994, when he arrives at The Burrow through a blood-soaked tear in space. His sudden return - and a series of terrorist attacks that have the signatures of the Death Eaters all over them - has gotten Alastor Moody's attention, and he has some questions for his former protégé.But, what happened to Aaron isn't straightforward. Ten years earlier, a dragon-obsessed redhead, a hand magic prodigy, a young metamorphmagus, and a kid who can't even use magic - or so he thinks - arrive at Hogwarts as a controversial act threatens muggle-born autonomy. Within months of its conception, muggle-borns across the UK are being found dead. The class of 1984 soon find themselves involved in a series of interconnected events that lead to the killers, Aaron's disappearance, and the Second Wizarding War.

** Well, the linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) series has Harry's brief failed relationship with Cho, and Sirius/OC but that doesn't take much screen time, and recently an interesting fake relationship to distract Rita Skeeter from falsely accusing Remus of infidelity. But that's all, in well over a million words and still updating.

The premise is that Sirius escapes from Azkaban five years early, and doesn't have any leads on Peter, so instead he takes Harry. There's no special Black family magic, no super!Harry, he just gets a flawed-but-caring parental figure. While hiding from a huge manhunt.
