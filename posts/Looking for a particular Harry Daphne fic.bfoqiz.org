It's a good fic but its not it. Further detail for anyone who sees this post-*This is when Harry is 11 and has just entered Hogwarts and is therefore unaware of wizarding society's intricacies*

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11237394/1/One-Thread-Pulled][One Thread Pulled]] /may/ be the fic even if I'm far from sure.

PS : looking back into the Harry/ Daphne fic I read, it's amazing how many of them are full of cliche : Harry Potter Slytherin Gryffindor Merlin . . . , 75 bedroom plus piscine and Quidditch pitch trunk, Lord and Ladies . . .

*** I read that when I was younger. It was horrifying-(the cliche not One Thread Pulled). Oof its not One Thread Pulled. Another tip for more people-*Harry was not raised by anyone within his biological family, it was a crossover with either DC or Marvel.*

**** Oh, that explain why I could not find this fic (think I read or at least tried too pretty much all the Harry/ Daphne), I tend to stay away from crossovers.

And recently, one of my guilty pleasure is to return to really popular fics I remember I remember I liked, and just to make a list of all the cliches I found. Worst is, most of them don't even follow the Chekhov's gun rule, meaning that the 7 bedroom appartment trunk's Harry bought in Diagon Alley and that deserved a 500 words scene was completely useless for the rest of the story, as where most of the item bought during this 5k words chapter, pure dream fulfillment).

** Was it complete or nah? I did some digging in ffn and I've got a few potentials. One of which is the one I wrote, though it's not complete or a crossover.
