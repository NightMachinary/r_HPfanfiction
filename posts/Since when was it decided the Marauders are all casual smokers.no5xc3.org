So of late I've taken roads previously less travelled and read a lot of Marauders-era FF, and a peculiarity I've noticed is that authors seem to have all decided that the Marauders, Lily, and their friends all light up somewhat regularly like it's no big deal. And often not just regular ol tobacco, but marijuana joints as well.

Now I'm not quite old enough to have been a teenager in the 80s, and I do recall my parents telling me that social smoking was practically /de rigueur/ a long time ago, at least among guys. But my parents pre-date the Marauders and by my time the anti-smoking campaigns were in full force, it was rapidly falling out of fashion. (Edit: Apparently my parents are lots closer to Marauders-age than I reckoned. Now that's a thought...)

Still, I don't think it was quite that common amongst 15 year olds in the mid-70s? (edited: Ok I was off by 10 years. Which at least explains the Marauders a little. But still not Lily and her contemporaries.) Especially amongst girls, who would have viewed it as a thing that only "loose" girls did.

Would be interested to hear opinions, especially from older readers (if any) on this.


** They would have been at school throughout the 70's not 80's if that makes a difference?

Also, they were living in a boarding school away from TV and parents and media so likely wouldn't have seen the adverts?

Also. Theres something inherently appealing about how badass smoking would have had to have been right? Especially for a group of troublemakers like the Marauders? Since cigarettes (i assume based on nothing) are a muggle thing so they'd have to be smuggled in. I can imagine Sirius smoking just to piss off his parents and Remus doing it to deal with the stress of Lycanthropy. The other two, eh maybe, maybe not.

That's my two cents on it. Though half of my year smoked at school and that was only 10ish years ago? So definately they knew it was bad and did it anyway. Because "cool".

*** Argh, it was the 70s. Okay that explains a little. Remus would have if he was working-class as he is commonly portrayed. Sirius would have because, well, /Sirius/. James might have, perhaps in defiance of the parents; Peter would certainly have succumbed to peer pressure.

But /Lily/, let alone /Lily and her girl friends/, I highly doubt.

**** Wrt to Lily, from what I understand she grew up in a very working class town of Birmingham or Manchester (where ever cokeworth is).

Personally I've always headcanoned her being very working class so her dad probably smoked (and I like to think was part of the Mining working force because this would have been around Thatcher era and Lily having to fight pure blood class-ism and Tory-classism is more interesting characterwise. Shes discriminates against on every front. Make sense as to why she's fierce... Anyway I'm getting off track)

Anyway! Lily being working class probably meant she grew up around smokers (I'm am very much stereotyping here but you get the idea. It's a headcanon of a fantasy book series, I'm allowed). So even if she didn't habitually smoke, she wouldn't be a stranger to it

*** Peter joining in because it 'looked cool' (as in, made him look cool) and everyone else was doing it.

James joining in because it looked fun.

and they're Gryffindors */shrug/*

Lily, I don't understand. Still, I've always thought of her as pretty attractive so her smoking I'm fine with.

I would lightly disagree with this. Yes there was an element of that- if you look at Grease, for example, Sandy is a Good Girl when she doesn't smoke... but all the other girls /do/ smoke and Sandy does when she becomes cooler. I know that Grease is set earlier, but it came out in the 70s and is more representative of 70s teenage behaviour than 50s. My mum was a teenager when it came out and was /obsessed/ with it. From what she told me, girls her age all at least tried smoking or pretended they liked smoking, including her though she was not a smoker as an adult. It was associated with being sexy and slim, as it was considered a weight management tool. For context, my mum grew up in a industrial Midlands town, just as Lily did.

*** Yeah my maths was off. So I'll admit it makes sense for the Marauders. Lily still throws me though, for I think 2 reasons. One, my mum has similarly humble background (down to the Grease obsession... I have some original movie merch somewhere....) but she and her friends were much more the Sandy type, so I may be hearing from a very prim view of things. But that's on me I guess. Two, Lily is often portrayed in FF as indeed a very prim and proper swot like Hermione, and it's a tad jarring to see her casually bring a few packs to Hogwarts or pass a joint around with James and co.

I mean, yes, it may have been the thing for older typing pool girls to do but still... 15...? At that age I would have expected it treated like illicit alcohol, smuggled in small amounts and reserved for late-night experimentation at dorm parties.

**** Yeah we can only speak to our experience really! Personally I'm not a fan of the prim and proper characterisation but she's such a blank slate anything goes!

** You have to remember that the Marauders were teenagers in the */1970s/*, not the 1980s. That makes a big difference. I was born in 1980, which means I'm old enough to remember when all restaurants, sit-down dining and fast-food, had smoking and non-smoking sections (smoking in restaurants banned when I was 13). In 1988, on the first airplane flight I ever took, on one leg we were seated in the non-smoking section, but immediately behind the smoking section--not fun. And I can remember when cigarette vending machines were in every airport, bus terminal, and train station (that didn't get banned until 2011ish).

My dad smoked a pipe until shortly after I was born, when my mom made him quit. Her dad started smoking in the Navy in WW2 and didn't stop until his quintuple bypass surgery in the late Seventies.

Long story short, for male teenagers in the 1970s, the Marauders smoking is totally believable. The public health campaigns against smoking had started in the '60s & '70s, but the cultural normalization of non-smoking really didn't happen until the 1990s.

*** Yeah [[/u/WhistlingBanshee][u/WhistlingBanshee]] reminded me I was a decade off. And yes I do know male teens in the 70s smoked as a matter of course; it was treated as no big deal, like drinking. So that does solve MWPP themselves. But Lily is still the shocker to me.

**** Honestly, of the two Evans sisters, I'd peg Petunia as more likely to be a smoker than Lily. Although it's implied that the Evanses were lower class, so that skews the probability somewhat in favor of smoking.

** My mom started smoking at age 12, she was at a sleepover and the other girls were smoking so she did as well. This was the early 70s, both of her brothers started around that age as well. They lived in Georgia, could be a regional thing?

Edit: The poster below who mentioned smoking being associated with being fit is spot on, youtube some vintage cigarette ads, Virginia Slims were heavily marketed to women.

** This is not what you were looking for but I have a head canon that the Marauders knew a young “hedge wizard” with a penchant for smoking named John Constantine. Sirius met him when he tried to run a con to break into Grimauld Place and steal some Grimours and they we friends since then.
