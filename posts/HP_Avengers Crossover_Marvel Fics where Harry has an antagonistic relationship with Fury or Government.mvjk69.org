I'm looking for fic recommendations. I'm also looking to find one in particular: here, Harry had to fight Avengers because Fury considered Harry a threat. It had harry fighting SHIELD forces with a pan (spelled to be unbreakable).


** I've got a work in progress where Master of Death Harry ends up being sucked into the Movie Avengers storyline.   This is a Harry who is 31 years old, fed up to his back teeth with the whole Hero thing, whose only contact with the Magical World being Hermione and Ron, and he has sworn off getting involved in things that don't directly affect him. Here's what I've got so far:

Harry reached for his phone as he continued to stock the display within his shop.

"Good morning, Books and More," he said into the phone.  "How can I help you?"

"Harry!" a familiar voice responded.  "Have you seen the news?"?

"And a good morning to you as well, Hermione," Harry laughed at his excitable friend.  "I'm having a lovely day, and happy birthday.  32 today aren't you?  That's positively ancient, isn't it?"

"Harry this isn't the time for the stupidity that passes for your sense of humor," she snapped.  "There is some kind of monster rampaging through London and according to the news reports it's in your area."

Harry put down the box of delicate glass figurines and moved to his front window to look out into the quiet street.  "I don't see anything," he reported via the phone.  "Are you sure this isn't a dramatic program of some sort?  There have been instances of someone tuning into a movie in the middle and thinking what they're seeing is real."

"Harry!" Hermione scolded him, "this is real.  I'm not imagining anything, I didn't tune in to the middle of a movie, it's real.  Some kind of 60-foot dinosaur thing is rampaging through London! The new is showing it destroying the shops on Charing Cross right now!"

Harry shrugged despite her not being able to see him, "I'm not seeing anything..." he said only to be interrupted with a huge scaled foot crashed through his wall, utterly destroying 20 feet of bookshelves and the books the shelves held.

"Harry!" Hermione's panicked voice called over the phone.  "What is happening?"

"Hermione," Harry said, watching the giant foot leave the building doing as much if not more damage as it had when it first arrived.  The elder wand appeared in his right hand.  "I'm going to have to call you back."

Dropping the phone on one of the few remaining counters of his shop, Harry exited his building looking for the creature who thought stepping on his stop might have been a good idea.

---oooOOOooo---

Giving his favorite saucepan a careful wipe, Harry finished the last of the dishes from the meal with his best friends.  He had a dishwasher, but sometimes he needed the mindless repetition of doing the chore by hand to settle his mind.

He hadn't been surprised by Hermione's reaction to Vernon, but he hadn't expected Ron to find the whole idea to be as funny as he had.

That was Ron, Harry laughed to himself as he hung the saucepan on its hook.  He never took much of anything seriously.

Exiting the kitchen back into his sitting room, Harry found a stranger sitting on his sofa.  A one-eyed black man.

“Mr. Potter, you've become part of a bigger universe. You just don't know it yet,” the stranger said.

The Elder wand appeared in Harry's hand before he asked the question he had wanted to ask since he first spotted the man, “And who the hell are you?”

“Nick Fury,” the man said, “Director of S. H. I. E. L. D. I'm here to talk to you about the Avenger Initiative.”

“Director of what?” Harry asked. “And you want to talk to me about what?”

“SHIELD,” Fury repeated.  “The Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics Division.”

“Ah,” Harry nodded. “Clear as mud.  What do you want?”

"There was an idea, called the Avengers Initiative. The idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people, see if they could become something more. See if they could work together when we needed them to fight the battles we never could."

“You've practiced that, haven't you?” Harry snarked.  “Avengers Initiative?  Anything to do with those five loonies who tore up New York fighting aliens?”

“Yes,” Fury acknowledged, confused by the reaction he was getting from the young man.  “I would like you to join them.”

“Yeah, no,” Harry shook his head.  “I'm not interested.”

“You did something to that Kaiju, and now it's in that Habitrail,” Fury noted.  “I watched you do it in real-time on the satellite feed.  Then I watched your building reassemble itself.  If you had been in New York, lives could have been saved.”

“Maybe,” Harry agreed, keeping his distance from Fury.  “Not that they would have appreciated it, and I'd still have been blamed for not doing more, sooner.”

“You've heard about the lawsuits?” Fury asked in understanding.

“No,” Harry admitted, “But I've tried the whole ‘hero' thing.  It never ends well, it's never appreciated, and you always get blamed.  I'm not interested.”

“But you stopped the Kaiju!” Fury insisted. 

“He stepped on my home and business,” Harry pointed out.  “I will react when it affects me and mine.  If he'd missed me, I'd have let him go.”

“You have great power, Mr. Potter,” Fury growled while hoping that the Parker kid never heard what he was going to say.  “Having great power requires having great responsibility.”

“You've rehearsed that as well, haven't you?” Harry laughed while picking up the salt shaker from the table and giving it a light rub with the cleaning cloth that had been hung over his shoulder.  The cloth shielded a sudden blue glow from Fury's sight.  “You're not going to let this go, are you, Mr. Fury?  You don't strike me as someone who is used to being told no.”

“Being a leader is like that,” Fury said.

“Still,” Harry said examining the salt shaker for cleanliness, “it's always good to experience new things.  Catch.”

A confused Fury saw that the thing arcing toward him was a salt shaker.  Without effort, and despite only having a single eye, the man plucked the shaker out of the air.  His visible eye went wide as he felt a hook behind his navel.

Harry smiled as Fury disappeared from his sitting room.  “Feel free to go fuck yourself,” Harry said to the empty room. "Avengers Initiative. What a loonie."

  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...
