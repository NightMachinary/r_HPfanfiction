Bonus points if he is not the BWL and long fics


** You know, I kind of want to see a story where Harry is a powerhouse, but he doesn't flaunt it. He doesn't rub it in people's faces. He isn't an arrogant prick. He keeps to himself or has a network of friends.

...But he frightens the shit out of people by /accident/.

*** Umm, this means war by jeconais is somewhat like that, where Harry does impossible things simply because he doesn't know it's impossible.

**** I remember reading that fic years ago, but for the life of me I can't remember anything about it.

Guess it's a good excuse for a re-read. ;)

*** OP isn't asking for canon. They're asking for fanfiction. And presumably where Harry doesn't have /any/ friends. He's most certainly not depicted as a loner in the books anyway.

** Well, I cannot assure you how this fic will turn out, since it's only in its beginning. So far, it fits in your request. He is stronger, smarter, rather introverted and a No-BWL. Perhaps you'll enjoy it.

*** Do you know Sasuke from the Naruto anime? Think of his general mood, acts, and such being applied to Harry for the sake of him being 'dark' and cool.
