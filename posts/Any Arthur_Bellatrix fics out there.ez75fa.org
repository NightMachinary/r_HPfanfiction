Any length or completion status, preferably good. Doesn't need to be the main pairing, although this is preferred. I already read every story with them on ao3 (all two of them, lol). I really liked /Drown In My Shallow Heart/ and would like to read more on the pairing. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19393591]])

Thanks in advance! :)


** Not that silly as this pairing, but from the non-standard ones, I really like linkao3(11676102) and its sequels. And yes, it is probably in the tone exactly the opposite of what you are looking for.

*** I wasn't expecting an Arthur/Petunia fic when I requested Arthur/Bellatrix. But a chapter and a half in, I'm very intrigued. Thanks for the rec! :)

**** AFAIK, it is the only story (or series of stories; and my sequel) with this pairing, so it fits with your request as the most uncommon pairing possible.

****** linkao3(18770464) It is just a tiny one-shot, when I was too impatient for mzzbee to continue after chapter 3 of linkao3(13682133).

  This was the craziest thing Petunia decided to do in her life: speak the truth. Also, how parents disappoint us.

  (Sequel to Petunia's Invitation) Evanses, Dursleys, Weasleys, Potters... All these families, past and present, and all of them a source of some strife or another. Petunia doesn't seem to be able to disentangle herself from any of them.

I wish I could just put out a continuation while waiting on somebody to finish their story, lol. Good on you though! And nice story! :)
