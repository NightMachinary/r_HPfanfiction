Battered , beautiful, Brilliant Bellatrix.... She wasn't broken after all.

Sirius grinned like a madman as they dueled, it was like Hogwarts all over again. With.... James... no Harry at his side and Bellatrix Bantering with him as their wands clashed.... Bella.... Bella was still in their somewhere.... He knew those spells, Her fall back in any duel.... Cruelty with an edge of kindness That was always her Cardinal rule.... Battered , Beautiful, Broken Bella.... Was still a Quickdraw in a Duel . He was out practice slower then he had been. She.... she wasn't coming at him with The same vigorous she did the rest, It was almost like she was trying to herd him, Away from the rest.

Brutal in her execution, Yet hesitant with each slash. Maybe he wasn't the only one who couldn't kill as easily easily as the rest. In an instant he saw the flash. “ Verticillium Tempius”. That wasn't an offensive spell ... What was she doing, He tried to unlock ... as he cast “ Expelliarmius” to try to disarm her before Her hesitance broke. She wasn't trying to kill him, She was forcing him back. Every third spell she would throw out , Some strange charm or hex , Always coaxing him bantering almost in jest. As if a battle didn't rage around them, Like it was just them once again, Back in Grandfather's halls when they would duel for hours , So that she knew Under his mother's hand he would never fall. For this instance it felt like he had Bellatrix back again.

Her “ Bombarda “ Took him by surprise, He was able to shield but it knocked him back . Back into the voices, she drove him back . Bella's eyes flashed in An instant with glee, As if to scream a silent “finally”.... As he fell back he realized she planned this.... ” Verticillium Tempius”..... indeed.

Blackness engulfed him As he fell into the void. In agony it crushed him, in a cruel torture he could not avoid. As quickly as it came the darkness fled, From one blink to the next , his world changed.

He was back again. Back in the cold stone rooms of Blackwood Hall, Hidden under table with Bella battered and bleeding beside him. In his right hand he Clutched A bloodstained letter As an Owl circled overhead.

Sirius Black Second dining room from the left Blackwood Hall , Dartmoor

He looked at the parchment in disbelief, He heard laughter to his left. Bella was beside him, The madness gone from her eyes, .... “Verticillium Tempius huh Siri?” .... He was alive, That mad bitch planned this. Battered , beautiful, bloody Brilliant Bellatrix..... She wasn't broken after all.

She gave him a second chance, the Mad bitch that she was. She fought way out of that hell That was her mind.... Just to keep him alive. ... Damn it all Bella.... It was his turn to keep them both sane this time
