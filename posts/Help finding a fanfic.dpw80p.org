:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Help! There is a fic, I don't remember where or what it is called, I just remember that Harry was going Hogwarts (first year) and ends up classified in Slytherin.

Harry (I don't know why) is open to say he is abused and doing all the housework, earning a nickname like a house elf without knowing what it was, making fun of all Slytherin.

But when he finds out what it is, his magic gets out of control and floods the common room and Snape scolds everyone for behaving badly with Harry and make fun of him.

It's the only thing I remember about that, I don't know anymore.

If anyone knows, let me know, please!


** I know it but i don't remember the title Remindme 2 days!\\
Edit: From what i remember i think it might have Obscurial harry in it too
