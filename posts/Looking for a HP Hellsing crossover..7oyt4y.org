From what I remember the first time Harry visits the Goblins at Gringotts he basically finds out that the Potters own a significant chunk of the Hellsing organization, or the land they use, or something like that. Somehow.

Using this as leverage, with the Goblin's advice/help, he sends a politely worded "request" to Integra, asking for help with different living arrangements.

Integra investigates and finds that Harry is likely being abused. This combined with real leverage that Harry has that would be annoying to deal with leads her to agree to house him, or adopt him.

At first, Harry has no idea what Hellsing is or that Alucard exists, I don't think.

Does anyone know what fic this is?


** No, but linkffn(Best Served Cold) has Harry reveal he is Hellsing's Auditor, and Alucard's walk partner.

  Unexpected time travel can provide endless hours of entertainment...if you do it right. Under any other circumstances Harry would have done everything in his power to set things right the Gryffindor way. Too bad he's learned a lot since that final battle. Meet the biggest prankster in the Ministry's dreaded Audit department, and with one heck of a grudge to grind!

  HIATUS. After Harry's 5th birthday, his true powers are unleashed, powers so dark that Dumbledore felt the need to bind them. Fleeing the Dursleys just before his 11th birthday, he seeks refuge with his family's ancestral allies, the Hellsings. DARK. AU Crossover

*** Yup, that's it.

I'd skipped over that one like 3 times after only reading the first sentence of the description lol.

Thanks. Now to see if it was actually any good...
