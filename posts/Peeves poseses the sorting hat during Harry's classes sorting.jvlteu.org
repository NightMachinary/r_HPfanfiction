** Better yet it turns out Peeves does all the sortings, because the Sorting Hat is just a hat, and that's why they never get rid of Peeves.

**** I think Peeves is not that cruel, also he probably wants to annoy the Bloody Baron so he sends the really stupid ones to Slytherin.

** Well, Dumbledore tries this in Who Is Harry Potter? by BeepKeeper (he transfigures Peeves into a fake Sorting Hat) because he wants to control which houses the children go into. This is thwarted when Fawkes brings the real Sorting Hat. linkffn(13218646)

  When Harry arrives at Gringotts, Hagrid produces the key but there's nothing else proving that the child is Harry Potter. What if there is a dark story behind the origin of the Boy-Who-Lived. Bashing Potters, Sirius and Dumbles. Good Goblins and Harry's adventures at Hogwarts. HEA in the end.
