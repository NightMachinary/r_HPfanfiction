** IIRC, this one is pretty solid. It's a one-shot, with Luna going back in time and raising Tom. It's present tense, and straddles that line between charming and creepy prose very well. It's been a while since I read it, so I can't give many specifics, but I remember enjoying it and it takes like 15 minutes to read, so...

  One Shot. AU. After all, every child deserves a mother who loves them. Even those who grow up to be monsters. Luna just never imagined things would turn out this way. Time Travel.

** Good ol' HP goes back in time and I'll let you read the rest for yourself. It's pretty good and has an unfinished sequel. The sequel is an actual sequel with a different plot so it's not a nightmare it's not finished.

  "If I do this, you won't have done anything, Harry. You won't exist. You'll probably never exist." Hermione coughed roughly, the damp irritating her lungs. "None of this will have happened." Hermione has lost everyone and everything in the war. Left with only one terrible choice, she honors Harry's sacrifice and goes back to change history. Reposted from AO3
