I'm looking for fics that are fun to read similar to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2841153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sword-of-Gryffindor][Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor]]


** These are both shorter than the two you mentioned, but I think you'll like them regardless.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/14/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily Riddle and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] was recommended on here recently. It's a frequently updating WIP. Very, Very absurd, some rather dark elements when you think about it, writing quality is OK, but could be better. Definitely give it a spin.

7th Horcrux is a wonderful little comedy that is nearly completed. Definitely read through 2nd year; if you aren't finding it amusing by then you probably don't have a soul. It can be found on the [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/seventh-horcrux-thread-2-a-harry-situation.311264/][SpaceBattles forums]]. There are only [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][a few chapters]] posted on FF.net so far, but the author says the rest of them will be polished and posted within a few months.

*** Gryffindors Never Die is one of my favourite comedy-ish fics. It is absolutely hilarious but then still manages to actually bring about a fairly interesting story at the same time.

Edit: some of the Uric the Oddball stories by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/55419/Ariana-Deralte][Ariana Deralte]] are lighthearted/funny.
