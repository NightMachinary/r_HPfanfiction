Hi all,

I've been working on a review list for beginners to fanfiction. Something that would give them an overview to some of the better fics in the community. I plan to review all novel-length fics in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5409855/xvector][*my favorites*]] and on the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/DLP-5-Starred-and-Featured-Authors/84507/99/0/1/0/100/0/0/][*DLP 5-star C2*]].

Hopefully, this will allow new readers to find a great reference/starting point for Harry Potter fanfiction. They won't be put off by some of the more cliche/worse fanfictions in the community. Feel free to reference this list.

[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L42j8DtQjwikqv0ggbwA-W25Ccl77V1E2nO96fThTyI/edit?usp=sharing][*Check it out here!*]] Criticism, suggestions, etc is welcome!


** Definitely support the effort. I think there should be more of this kind of thing: lists of recs backed up by reviews and /why/ you think a fic is worth reading.

*** Yeah! I know DLP and other communities have entire forums dedicated to fic reviews, but I hoped that a more concise list might make accessing the HP fanfic universe easier for others.

** I love all of these fics but I'm not sure if they're good suggestions for beginners. I mean four of these are crossovers with Dresden Files, something that fans of HP might not necessarily like. I would personally favour suggesting fics which are close enough to canon (without being rehashes) so that the fans of the books might not be totally lost. Sort of like Ectomancer or Forging the Sword rather than Wastelands or Skitterleap.

Also, beginners would have an opportunity to start fresh, in a position where they are not instantly turned off by what we think to be cliches. Reign of Power, for example, would be a great read to people who aren't tired of reading about Lordship shenanigans.

Anyway, the ones you recommended are pretty good and if this gets more people to read them and/or into fanfiction then awesome.

*** I agree. When I first started reading fanfiction, I only read continuation or 'A Day in the Limelight' fics. I just wanted more of canon, basically. It took me the longest time to even consider reading a crossover.

**** Seconded. I started out looking for fics like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince]] that put you smack-dab in the middle of canon and /felt/ like a Harry Potter book. Something like /Browncoat, Green Eyes/ I would have felt viscerally /against,/ because I was looking for a certain kind of purity.

Similarly, when I first started reading fanfiction, /Wastelands of Time/ would have felt, I don't know - wrong, bad, stupid, take your pick. It would have been lost on me. Eventually, of course, you branch out, you start seeing the wild things people can do with the characters and the setting and the magical world.

Nowadays, I'm all the way back around to where I started and I have a great appreciation for stories that can really emulate canon tone (like Forging the Sword.) I have a pretty broad palate, but I do tend to really gravitate towards things that have that Original Flavor feel.

***** Thanks for the input!

I suppose I was the opposite after starting fanfiction. I didn't like fics that emulated canon much, unless they were absolutely exceptional and super-amazing with character development.

However, I do see what you mean. *I will add a measure indicating AU-ness, and then arrange the stories in increasing order* - so readers can start off with stories close to canon, and as they see what can be done with fanfiction, progress through the list.

** A surprising amount of fics I have not read, so this is definitely helpful and I will be going through it.
