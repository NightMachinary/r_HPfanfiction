I am talking about "collision of worlds" type of fanfic were two worlds that constitute canon didn't have any interaction before story, but a story progress, they interact more and more. Common trope used in such stories that pre-Hogwarts Harry gets abruptly transported into other world and get raised by character from there. What is common in those story is that HP side is usually clueless about entire event - Harry just disappears for years and returns into his homeworld by the time he needs to enter Hogwarts, in order to thwart plots of original books with imported superpowers.

I am writing HP x D&D crossover, where, due to combination of factors, eight years old Harry gets transported into D&D universe. However, Dumbledore acts fast, conceals Harry disappearance, investigates event and year later manages recreate portal and ventures there with prepared Order of Phoenix expedition. Consequently major part of story is going to be the tale of adventures of Dumbledore's rescue team, rather than Harry himself.

Are there any good major fics that did it? Story were good wizards venture into other world with mission, rather than being in the dark and in defense position?


** There's a lot of potential in this sort-of genre, especially if time displacement is involved: if one dimension has time moving faster or slower than Earth?

Harry vanishes when he's at a certain age and returns at a different age... or the same age.

If he were young, he may still be that -- people expect him to be like eleven when he's still five. If he were a teenager in Hogwarts? They expect him to return as his fourteen or thirteen year old self; instead, he's either an adult or an old man, having lived his life in the other world after giving up ever getting home.

If he were a kid at five but returns as a teenager or as an adult, when he was still supposed to be five? Spicy.

The latter two could be pretty good for drama, especially if he settled down and had a family with one of the natives there.

Last time Dumbledore and his friends saw him, he was a fourteen year old kid; now he's a dude in his thirties or forties, married, and has kids. Worse still, after living most of his life in the Other Place, and having built a life there, he only spent the first decade, maybe decade-and-a-half of his life on Earth. He probably wouldn't see it as his home anymore.

And friends? He could be friends with someone or others for twenty odd years -- far longer than the two/three he had with Hermione, Ron, et cetera.

Complicated. :D

**** Oh yeah, I know. My mind just wandered a bit, heh. I actually don't think I've seen that many stories where people from his universe try to rescue him. There were a few where he was followed by people, though -- IIRC one had a batshit insane Luna follow him, and another had his "crack team" (Neville and the others) following him, but one where Dumbledore tried to rescue him and return him home? I'm intrigued to what you're planning. :D

IIRC I also had a plot bunny months ago (a year?) where Harry and Fleur vanished in the Second Task, but when they were brought back, they were practically an old, happy yet bickering married couple with a kid or two.

Maybe I should flesh out a prompt for people, in a new thread?

***** Well in my story, the opposite planned to happen. Harry is 8, when he is transported. D&D world is humongous collection of planes and realms, so it will take many years for Order of Phoenix to find Harry even with convenient plot twists, but I want Harry to get to Hogwarts in time. So Harry's otherworldly guardian, decides that boy didn't have normal childhood, with boy's agreement rejuvenates him into infancy of one biological year. Order of Phoenix searches him far and wide for almost ten years and finds him shortly before he turns eleven, while the time that passed in HP world is also chronological corresponds to Harry reaching age of 11, taking things back into their original pace once Harry is in Hogwarts. Though consequences of whole ordeal make Harry, Order of Phoenix and Wizarding World wildly divergent from original timeline, that putting aside further worlds interaction.

I think your should make a thread for your idea, effects of sudden time shifts on people is interesting topic on its own.

***** I may translate it in the future if I manage to actually write it with more or less stable schedule, but for now I don't think it is worth try. I am not that confident in my English. Story is called "Harry Potter and the World on the Other Side of Cupboard":\\

******* Thanks! Though I don't think I deserve to receive it completely in blind, so here is synopsis of what happens in published chapters so far:

- October 31, 1981. Dudley frames Harry for stealing his Halloween candies. Which makes Dursleys lash out onto Harry especially viciously. In act of desperation, Harry rushes into his cupboard. But instead door leads to mysterious room with strange skeletal figure. It closes behind Harry's back.
- This happens due to coincidence of several factors: Halloween, seventh anniversary of Lily's sacrifice, Harry strongly emotional wish to be somewhere else accompanied by outburst of underage magic, and [Wish] spell cast by certain lich in city of Sigil, who wished for apprentice in form of lonely magical orphan who is unhappy with their current life and is not tied to the fate of D&D universe.
- Lich shows Harry his lost early childhood memories, and than using, still stable gateway, together with Harry visits HP's Limbo were he allows Harry to see his parents and strike the deal with them, as Lily didn't sense malice in lich's [Wish].
- Lich indeed doesn't have malicious intent towards Harry himself. He became lich purely out of insatiable thirst for knowledge. He wants kid as Harry as apprentice purely because he wants to add force major factor to his endeavors, thwarting whatever gods and fate have for him in store.
- Dumbledore detects that his defensive spells on Dursley's household were destroyed by sudden surge of unfathomable magic.
- He immediately arrives on location, finds source of disturbance and interrogates Dursleys. Realizing that he severely underestimated extant to which Dursleys despised and mistreated their nephew, Dumbledore is devastated as he failed to protect yet another Potter. He reminisces McGonagall arguing against housing Harry with Dursleys and decides to radically change his approach to planning his actions and to extend his circle of confidence, as his overreliance on using others in blind failed him yet again.
- Dumbledore investigates locked and decaying magic on cupboard door. He identifies it as powerful gateway of anomalous properties, magic that doesn't follow established laws and deduces that is gateway to other world. Stopping decay of gateway magic, he leaves and drinks himself to sleep in his office.
- Lich shows Harry around small part of Sigil and they use portal to get lich's homeworld and there they get into his base, where Harry is introduced to Lich's top henchmen-comrades: dullahan blackguard, vampire assassin and psion star spawn. All four of them were once human adventuring party...
- Dumbledore wakes up on afternoon of 1st of November. He immediately arranges meeting that includes himself, Severus Snape and Minerva McGonagall, whom he decides to make his confidents from there on. He honestly and in details presents them with full Prophecy, Lily's sacrifice, his reasons to leave Harry with Dursley and what happened last night. He only omits Snape's role in delivering prophecy to Voldemort.
- Their plans include preparation of expedition and reopening of the Gates, forcing Dursleys to sell house to Snape, faking Harry's relocation to India, preventative strike against Voldemort's supporters in Ministry in order to prevent Voldemort from chance of restoring his power while core fighters of Order of Phoenix are away, more active investigation of Voldemort's past in order to find out secret to his apparent immortality. In order to maximize his new "thinking out of the box" approach, Dumbledore is even planning to recruit Muggle scientist to help the effort.
- Certain remorseful prisoner of Numengrad sees a vision, that signifies that his life is yet to bring him more surprises.
- Lich plans to give Harry for adoption to a childless couple of former adventurers, who owe him favor. But first he is planning to pull out a spiritual parasite he discovered in Harry. In order for procedure to be safe, Harry needs to defeat it in his subconsciousness. So he puts boy into sleep and with help of his psionic ally, creates virtual adventure in Harry's dream. (This dream is yet to be written, it is planned to be kind of tutorial that serves as exposition of differences between D&D and HP magic)

** There's only one I can recommend and that is /Lily Potter and the Worst Holiday/ where in Harry's reality there is war and death and destruction and almost all the Weasleys are dead, and in Lily's reality Harry and Ron and Neville and a bunch of other people are dead instead. Harry then stops Voldemort in the other reality (Lily's) that he traveled to. Its pretty depressing and has around 10 chapters, but I hope its something along the lines that you're looking for.
