Are any of the fan endings of Josephine Darcy's The Marriage Stone good? That fic was so good, and I have been reluctant to ruin it by reading the ending, but I know at least 5 or 6 people have written continuations. Let me know if there are any that you really like!

** I've been following [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7136253/1/My-Tribute-to-Josephine-Darcy-s-The-Marriage-Stone][this]] continuation of the Marriage Stone by Yengirl. It's pretty good, but we're lucky if there's two updates a year right now.
