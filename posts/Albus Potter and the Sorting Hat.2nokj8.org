Hi all. A while back I posted a synopsis for the next series of books that I in part literally dreamed up one day. I'd fleshed it out that morning and posted the idea. Some users asked that I write up a short fanfic about it. I'm not typically a writer of fanfiction (not since my high school days) but I was flattered so decided to give it a shot.

So attached is the first part of the story. Hope you like it so far.

** It suffers a bit from overtly mature 11 year olds, but I like it. Do continue.

*** Thank you. I may in fact do so when taking a breaking from my original writing.
