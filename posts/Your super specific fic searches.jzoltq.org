Either like specific tropes you keep looking for or like a specific type of story you keep looking for.

Common searches for me for example

/Atypical main cast /weird friendships/

Like Harry not friends with Ron or Hermione, Draco + Bill Weasely brotp ( yes this is because of The Code)

/Emphasis on friendship/

not just like the friends being the most important relationships but also talents of each member of the friend group being roughly equally important and plot relevant not just talents of the MC

/More focus on the adult characters/

like canon divergence fics set post Marauders leaving school but before Harry is born or while he still a toddler or fics during Harry's time in school but the adults are the main force against Voldy and Harry + friends do very little/ aren't the focus at all.

/Not hogwarts/

Stories about what people do in the Wizarding world post hogwarts. So stories about studying magical creatures or being a auror or healer or curse breaker or extended war or just anything at all post graduation.

/Snape's negative actions in canon getting more emphasis and him not being redeemed for having a crush on Lilly./

I see alot of fics where people emphasize his trauma or kinda down play his actions. Im more interested in exploring the trauma he caused everyone else. Both the explicit canon ones like bullying his students and the more hinted at ones. Like you know he was on board with the death eaters while at school and the future death eaters were already acting out. And he'd likely be a part of that in one way or another. ( Though not like typical bashing I don't want a exaggerated version of him.)

Etc.

So what are your specific fic searches?


** Recently, I've been looking for fics featuring Regulus Black, but not a nice version of him (the one where he secretly doesn't believe in the blood supremacy), but a version where Regulus is rather dark. I want to see a true redemption arc, and not a story about a hero who (secretly) was always a good guy.

Also, fics where Sirius and Regulus have an older/younger brother, but with good characterisation. Fics about Black family in general.

I've been searching for fics focusing on Hogwarts Professors, and not necessarily when Harry was at Hogwarts. Mostly, just seeing Hogwarts from the point of view of an adult.

Like you, I've been looking for fics focusing on different types of careers, especially healers.

Stories that focus more on characters than action and featuring less-popular characters.

*** Renascentia from the ashes is my favorite Regulus and Sirius characterization its really well written and while it more about Regulus in general it emphasizes his relationship with Sirius. Its completed though it does have an incomplete sequel .

************ Hm, the most similar fic I've read is neither lost not found by the same authors üòÅ it's AU of AU and it's great because it ticks all boxes the same way renascentia series does.

There's the Black Sheep and Black Mask by izzythehutt. It's great and well-written, though I just dislike almost everyone besides Regulus and Orion, so I'm not that taken by the story.

And there's ozymandias by sirtwentyofhousegoodmen which I really liked. There's a scene between Arcturus and Sirius that made me completely speechless.

The world building is not as great in those fics and they have a few faults imo, but I think those come the closest. And it's all about Regulus and the Black family since I returned to HP fandom after a very long break for Regulus and I basically read everything featuring Regulus right now üòÅ

*** I'm writing a si/regulus fic. I always think of serial killers when I write him. The kind that are super intelligent and charismatic and then BAM they flip a switch and they're murder bots with a creepy glint in their eyes. I've tried to portray that he isn't really sane and it's only his occlumency and self control that keeps him from turning into Bella or Voldemort.

I don't think there will be a character redemption for him. My Reg simply isn't the type to give a shit about anyone other than himself or his family. Right now it's just Kreacher and (begrudgingly) his mother, but eventually he will include the SI, Sirius, and the Tonkses, so there's a bit of redemption in that he'll take a stand on their behalf.

** My super specific fic search is Hermione with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome as a result of the chronic stress starting Year 1. It has to explore how she deals with having to be constantly helped, especially when she was always the one rescuing other people over the years. Bonus if she manages to get to a place where the condition is well-managed enough that she still becomes a rising star in politics.

** Ritual magic is a big one for me.

In fresh bouquet, regulus uses a ritual circle to blow something up and in demonologist, a lonely child Hermione used them summon demons. I also really like the idea of rituals being passed down from a more ancient era of Britain, before Latin spells were marginalized throughout Europe and America and they've just fallen out of common practices but still used for things like fertility or enchanting objects.

Self-Inserts/OCs (that change the plot.)

I LOVE a good SI/OC that changes the plot. What's the point of getting thrown in for everything to remain the same? That being said, I really hate when they go through every year of hogwarts. It's so tedious and unrealistic. If you're a 20 something hanging out with a bunch of 11 year olds, you're going to want to pull your hair out at one point. Or every point. And it would be so difficult to hide from professors. Writing styles especially. I can't imagine having to dumb myself down for four or five years.

War/combat fics.

I'm talking using potions as greneades. Carving runes into your skin before battle. Getting caught up in spellfire and you can't see who's who through all the lights and smoke. Knowing you're outnumbered and taking death eaters out with you in a blaze of fiendfyre. Amputating your friends arm in the middle of battle before a curse can spread through their body. Your friend dying beside you in battle. Healers doubling as torturers because they know how much damage the body and mind can take. Voldemort using children as inferi and or under the imperius to make his enemies hesitate. Sleeping with the enemy to spy. Sleeping with the enemy to AK them in the middle of the night. The more brutal, the better.

Knockturn Alley

I want to know the shady side of the wizarding word. Prostitutes under polyjuice. Selling bodies to necromancers. Drug rings. Vampires running blood banks. Aurors are described as dark wizard catchers, right? What do dark wizards get up to when they're not fighting in a war for a dark Lord?

** My specific searches usually contain a line I think I remember from a story I want to find again.

When I'm not doing that, I'll usually search on a combination of character names, not so much because I'm looking for a relationship between them, but because I'm looking for stories that feature them. I've found that to be a useful technique for finding crossovers, particularly when I use the names of secondary characters. For example, looking for HP/Ranma crosses, I've found I'm more likely to find useful results by searching on something like "Hermione Nabiki" rather than "Harry Ranma."
