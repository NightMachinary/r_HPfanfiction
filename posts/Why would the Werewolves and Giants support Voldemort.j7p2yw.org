Supposedly Voldemort and his Death Eaters were looking to recruit werewolves, giants, and other nonhuman races to support their cause. But this does not make sense. The Death Eaters' cause was pureblood supremacy. That included the subjugation of those they believed to be beneath them. While that was primarily focused on muggles and muggle-born, nonhuman and half-human creatures would be included. So why is it possible for the Death Eaters to recruit nonhumans?


** For giants, it's their nature. They're violent organisms and kill each other in their natural environment. Being denied the ability to move around freely by a much more powerful entity (the ministry) cannot have felt good. It would have been easy to follow someone allowing them the opportunity for violence and strike at the entity.

For werewolves, it was desperation. They were second-hand citizens, relegated to a watch list and ostracized by society. They chose to follow someone who at least promised to do something. They probably knew in their hearts (though I have no doubt they rationalized it) it wouldn't happen, but they probably felt that they would at least get to fight. For a moment, they would be the ones oppressing their fellow wizards.

** They were using them. Promising them power freedom or rights they were denied under the current government. Its a common tactic in this sort of war. The weres were ostracized and some like greyback didnt care as long as they had targets to kill or infect. The giants just wanted to slaughter.

*** Well, obviously. I was talking more along the lines of why they (werewolves) believed the Death Eaters.

**** Grey backs group didnt really care. They were just out to get revenge on those that had cast them out. Others as someone else stated rationalized it away in whatever way would fit their mindset. Similar to how as stated in canon, a good chunk of death eaters weren't actually pureblood but lied in one way or the other saying they were so that they could be apart of the new regime and therefore safe and likely prosperous afterwards.

** My take is that you gotta call a spade, a spade. They are blood-thirsty monsters and they want to kill wizards. Voldemort offers that. The giants don't seem all that bright either. As for the werewolves, I think that while there out some outliers, like Remus, the majority succumbs to the wolf's desire for violence.

*** I agree. If the Ministry is in charge werewolves have to face scrutiny from their laws. If Voldemort is in charge maybe they have more freedom in attacking who they want.

** I think that Tom Riddle really wasn't about pure-blood supremacy (after all, he was a half-blood himself), but he cared only about his power. And for that he uses whatever means he could, including hiring non-humans.

** I've always believed that Voldemort started out as wanting to work on rights for "Dark" creatures and wanting to severely limit contact with Muggles and that the Knights of Walpurgis started out as a political group that supported these ideals, but after Voldemort created one-too-many Horcruxes, he became more unstable and bloodthirsty and then turned to violence and suddenly wanting to eradicate Muggles despite knowing how dangerous they are (WWII anyone?) and how they outnumbered wizards like 15-to-1. I'm just assuming that Voldemort still had that idea bouncing around his severely fucked up head and promised the werewolves and vampires more rights if he took over Magical Britain.

** Pretty simple- when people are oppressed or frustrated with their circumstances, some people take the position that any change, no matter how awful, is better than the status quo. Its an ultimately destructive position (in the real world, a lot of so-called "anti-establishment" types justified voting for Trump on more or less that basis), but its there.
