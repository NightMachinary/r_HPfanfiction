  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

*** I know you've recommended this one a lot, so could you give me a brief summary? Is it more geared towards action? Romance? Is it more Ron/Hermione focused or is it evenly balanced with Harry/Ginny? Are the trio presented as "super" versions of themselves? Is there any drama in the relationships or are they conflict-free outside of battles with Death Eater-types?

**** Action, and epilogue compliant in the canon universe.

I would say Harry/Ginny have equal weight in this fic as Ron/Hermione.

Canon Hermione doesn't take the other Hermione's presence well, and Harry doesn't like being called to risk his neck once more.

  Post Book 7 AU; A little over six years have passed since the events that ended the second reign of Voldemort. Now, Harry Potter is the one that needs to be rescued. Rising to this challenge is... Draco Malfoy? Apparently I have to say No Slash.

*** My only problem with this one is that it just continues to get more and more absurd as it goes on. Like it starts out pretty decent, and then evolves into something straight bizarre.
