Hello! I'm looking for fics that are from the Malfoy family perspective and include a bit more of their daily life. I'm fine with Draco going off to Hogwarts, but perhaps they go on holiday, or celebrate Christmas/Yule, or maybe host a ball at their house, or even a large get-together or two with Lucius' Death Eater buddies and all the kids get to interact in more ways than what we'd see at Hogwarts.

I'm also looking for something that's well-written and isn't filled with spelling errors.

Thanks so much!
