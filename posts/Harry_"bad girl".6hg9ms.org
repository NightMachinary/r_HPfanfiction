What I'm looking for is harry being paired with a "Bad girl", I've read too many stories where the girl he is paired with is innocent or sweet. I want a story where whoever he is paired with is "bad". It can be a totally bitchy pure-blood or even a muggle. Just no harry/hermione or harry/Ginny. I'd prefer it if harry was powerful in the story but that isn't totally necessary. No Slash

  Harry always knew the monthly budget meetings were boring, but he didn't realize just how boring until Pansy Parkinson offered to show him something a little more interesting.

  HBP AU. It's hard enough being a teenager; add nefarious plots, the Dark Lord, and house rivalries into the mix. A story about enlightenment, darkness, growing up, and getting over yourself. Harry Potter/Daphne Greengrass

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

*** I had to laugh at your comment...I saw a recommendation for that because I was tired of the lazy 'ice queen' tropes. You know, where she is a bit stiff at first but one look at Harry and she is a total sweet heart. But yeah ice queen, 'bad' don't come close to this daphne.

  Secrets of the war, a murder and a fatal attraction: After his victory over Voldemort, Harry became an Auror, and realised quickly that it wasn't at all like he had imagined. Disillusioned with the Ministry, he takes on a last case, but when he starts digging deeper, his life takes a sudden turn ... AUish, Post-Hogwarts. HP/DG
