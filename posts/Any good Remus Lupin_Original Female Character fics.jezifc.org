Hi! Remus is my favourite character and I'm struggling to find decent fics, I would take either marauders era or golden trio era, I don't mind unfinished but I do enjoy long fics. I'm a sap for slow burn or even enemies to lovers. Also! to add if anyone has come across any good sirius black/ofc (again, any era) I'd be curious. Thankyou ðŸ’“


** They're a pairing in the Dangerverse which starts with linkffn(Living with Danger by whydoyouneedtoknow). It's an AU that covers preHogwarts thru Harry's seven years. The fics are ensemble but Remus and the OC are definitely main characters in the first one. Warning it has its own tropes page at TVtropes so YMMV.
