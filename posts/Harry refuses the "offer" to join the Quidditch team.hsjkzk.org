In canon Harry wasn't even asked whether he wanted to join the team or not. He wasn't even told directly that he would become seeker. He was simply present, while McGonagall told Wood that she had a seeker for him.

Now, I don't know about you, but I would be very miffed (to put it mildly), if I were just told that instead of being asked if I'm interested at all. I would say no on general sheer principle.

And Harry may have even more and better reasons: Not wanting the additional attention, not wanting to be accused of preferential treatment, not enjoying the idea of having balls made of iron shot at you, not enjoying Quidditch at all (only flying), maybe he already has reason to hate the other Gryffindors and wants nothing to do with them... I'd say Harry could have more than enough very valid reasons for refusing McGonagall's "offer".

I'd like to read some fics, where Harry tells her (and Wood and the rest of Gryffindor) "No". And the other characters should not exactly be too happy about that (without any consequences a fic with that premise would probably be rather short and pointless).

Also acceptable: Harry accepts grudgingly and makes them regret forcing that on him.

Thanks!


** It's pretty bash-heavy for Dumbledore, and it's a horror/Creepypasta crossover first and foremost, but

Linkffn(Harry by Proxy)

Has this, even the reluctant acceptance, and the overall fic is pretty good too. Be warned it'll take a while to get to this, Harry is in ravenclaw for a small bit before Dumbledore forces a re-sort, and Harry refuses at first but eventually accepts bc people keep harassing him about it. And he only accepts on a trial basis at the current point in time.

** Minerva McGonagall looked up from her paperwork as she was disturbed by a frantic, rapid knocking on her office door. She strode elegantly across the office floor with smile on her face. This was most likely Severus, unhappy at her recruiting young Harry Potter to her quidditch team. Despite their many clashes, she believed they both genuinely enjoyed the calm, simmering rivalry of sports over trying to quell their students' other extracurricular activities. Oh!, she was going to rub his face in-

Her train of thought was completely derailed when the person outside her office door was not Severus Snape, but a pale, sweating and positively shivering Harry Potter who immediatly started rambling faster than Flitwick after his third cup of wine and someone mentioned Animation principles.

"I'm so sorry, Professor! I promise I've learned my lesson! I'll be good, I won't mess around in flying class anymore. Just, please don't make me play quidditch, I was so scared. I-"

"Mr. Potter, calm down!" She decided to cut him off. "I'm sorry for raising my voice but I don't understand how your first practice with Mr. Wood has you this upset. What happened, one thing at a time". She said, trying to admonish the boy.

Harry gave her a queer look and took a few slow breaths. He was very much out of breath and had sprinted from the quidditch field to McGonagall's office. With some efforts he managed to order the whirlwind in his mind into the three things he thought she wanted to hear.

"I understand now. I broke the rules. First years aren't supposed to fly about. If they do, they have to play with the big boys who shoot cannonballs at them." He summarized.

"Bludgers, Harry." Minerva tried to regain a semblance of control after the dissonance of th words boy was saying and his tone threatened to vibrate her grey matter until it trickled out of her ears. "And your position on the Gryffindor quidditch team wasn't meant as a punishment, nor as the lesson you envision."

"Then why can't I wear a helmet during practice? Or let one of the big boys play the position that makes all the points? or..." He hestitated for a moment. "If it's not a punishment can I please, please not play quidditch?"

She could just imagine Severus' face once this made the rounds at the staff break room.

He was offered to be the youngest seeker at Hogwarts in a century and was to cowardly to accept, that's the kind of stuff he would be eternally reminded of. Not to mention him refusing because of a lack of helmet, just try to imagine how kids Harry's age would react to someone insisting that they would only play soccer with a helmet on.

Also Quidditch isn't that dangerous, for one Wizards are clearly more durable than muggles and no matter the injury as long its not magical in nature in can be healed quickly.

******* Seconded. I don't think wizards are supposed to be more durable either; they just have substantially better and more convenient injury treatment, as well as the ability to save lives on the spot, that mundane medicine, even modern, would lose.

Basically, unless Dark Arts, healer incompetence or lack of necessary supplies are involved, the long-term consequences of injuries can be magicked away, and badly mangled people can be brought back from death's door (into complete and perfect physical recovery, no less) as long as there still is some life in them when help arrives.

Incidentally that must have been a hell of a foul, probably a serious curse, which nipped Minerva McGonagall's Quidditch prospects in the bud and left her with a lifelong slight limp and grudge against Slytheryn.

** I don't remember any where he tells them no where it actually has any consequences - fics where he doesn't play Quidditch tend to be Robst-lites that have him 'off doing more important things like fighting wars' and such and everyone accepts that as a semi-decent excuse. :D

The only one that fits your 'also acceptable' that I know and remember is Something Like Your Family. McG says that your house will be like your family, and Harry finds that they're very, very like the Dursleys.

******* Oh, I would do pretty much anything legal-ish to get what I want, so setting my pride aside is not a problem. My point is in a situation where someone is pushing me to do something I'm not sure I want to do without consulting me. I can fly whenever after first year and in class during first year without having to worry about broken bones. For me, it's like if I got drafted without anyone asking me if I wanted, even if I do like (american) football. Being a fan of the sport and good at it does not mean I will risk CTE without even thinking about it and having the option to say no. In this situation, McGonagall is pushing an 11 year old into a dangerous sport where kids his age are not even allowed to participate just to win. If she did that to me even though I like quidditch as an spectator I would demand to be given time to think it over and if not allowed to I would tell her where to shove it.

***** I would have sated my curiosity for all things magical in the library - and then practicing in an unused classroom.

If I had particular curiosity for flying broomsticks, I would have bought one during the holidays and stored it in my Gringotts vault, if taking it to Hogwarts was forbidden.

Adventure? Not all 11-year-olds are the same. Harry certainly didn't behave like most 11-year-olds would, if they found out that they are insanely famous.

Sad? I, on the other hand, find it sad (or pathetic), when people have so little pride that they let others walk all over them, never saying no, no matter what they may want for themselves. There's no age too young to start learning to say no. But there probably is a point when it's too late.

Yes, it could be argued that it was something Harry would have wanted anyway. BUT: First, it was still unacceptable that he wasn't asked, as if his what he wanted didn't matter at all. Second, this isn't a discussion about canon. I was (and still am) asking for fanfics - meaning that Harry could easily have wanted something different than what he wanted in canon.

Besides, I personally am pretty prideful and I would have been blindsided and pissed as hell, magical flying broom or not. Do not sign me up for things I don't ask for with minor compensation, I don't care if you know I would have liked it or not.

In summary, because I am a freaking idiot who has to explain every detail of her thought process, Quidditch isn't just a game in this case, it is a commitment with minor bonuses, like playing on the football team at school, I would say. Damnit now this is long too.

** For everyone who says "he should have just said no, I would have" - you don't remember being a child at school do you. At real-world schools that have sport, it is generally compulsory, and children get very little choice about what sports they take part in. I had compulsory cross-country running, which I hated, but just refusing to take part never even crossed my mind. Nor did I even consider saying no to rugby despite having never seen it before and not knowing the laws. I had no choice but to go to rugby practice, no choice but to play for the school team, no choice but to play for my house in intra-mural competition.

*** It's just fanfiction, it's not like the author is saying they hate sports or something. You are taking this way too seriously. You're acting like the author is saying that we should remove quidditch from canon, when in fact they're just talking about fanfiction.

Also, not every boy wants to play sports. I never did, I was usually more interested in video games. Just because you and your friends liked sports while growing up doesn't mean everyone else does.

**** Same. I enjoyed watching them, but I never had the time nor desire to put in all of the time for practices and games.

*** And YOU stop being a whining dunderhead. You're not the center of OP's universe, and he wasn't attacking you. He was asking for a fanfic on HPfanfiction. A perfectly reasonable thing to do.

For your information, many 11 year olds hate sports. I did, and still do. I grew up in a family who loves AFL, and Cricket, and found it boring. I much rather had spent my time reading fictional stories then, and that plus scientific papers now. Just, because YOU like something doesn't mean EVERYONE likes it too.
