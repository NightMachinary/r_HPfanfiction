What is your definition of dark magic?

The killing curse obviously ranks on top of that list. But in canon, Dumbledore explicitly stated that Avada Kedavra used for euthanasia would not harm one's soul. Furthermore, it's supposed to be insta-death and relatively painless. So, is killing with Avada Kedavra really worse than confunding someone to jump in front of the London Underground?

The Ministry seemed to have outlawed many spells and rituals beside the Unforgivables. But we know from the Books that the Ministry was hardly infallible and barely qualified as a worthy authority. Where would you draw the line on what magic should be acceptable? What are the criteria you would use?

From the many fics I've read, their depictions of dark magic basically boil down to “101 ways how to kill someone painfully”. IMHO, this is terribly inefficient when two of the Unforgivables would do that job perfectly. Why bother wasting your effort in learning things that merely duplicated effects of something you already knew?

How potent should dark magic be? What are its cost beside poor PR? If the dark magic is so much more potent, as depicted in so many fics, then why is the world not being ruled by immortal dark wizards? Please, don't tell me the heroes have the backing of author fiats and plot armors.

I'd like to read your opinions.


** I'm really not sure why this is something that fanon gets so... strange.

The books are quite explicit about this: dark magic is using magic to harm someone. Dumbledore even gives Harry a lecture on how some spells that are called dark magic can be used to do things other than harm people as well, and they wouldn't be dark magic.

That harm can also be to the caster.

By the rules JKR has given us, this is dark magic:

1. Magic that causes harm to the caster.
2. Any magic that is used to cause harm to someone else.
3. Any magic that must cause harm to a third party as part of its casting.

So basically dark magic is entirely about intent, however some spells don't have much of a use if your intent isn't to cause harm (perhaps Sectumsempra might be an example of that?)

Dark magic is categorically evil according the canon, but that's because dark magic is DEFINED as magic that is used to do evil things, no matter what kind of spell it is.

******** Since they incapacitate, make uncomfortable or can even slightly injure or cause pain, they are definitely evil by definition. Just very little so. Just as pranking someone is be evil - it shames them in addition to any other direct negative effect of the prank.

I know what we generally mean by evil, and I don't mean that. I just like to be thorough given the discussion. Legally, of course, I can hardly imagine minor jinxes and hexes being classified as evil, it's more likely something where inordinate pain, incapacitation and/or murder would fit the definition. But you can certainly jinx and hex an enemy without doing any of those things to any considerable extent, and I can imagine it would certainly still be frowned upon and not exactly allowed in civil society. So, practically speaking, that's why I would classify them as evil. Because of their effects, intent, and targets as the case may be.

I agree with most of what you said except this. Dark magic is not categorically evil in canon. Dark magic just is, it is the intent in which it is used to determine if it was for evil or not.

A lot of good wizards in canon use dark magic and aren't evil. You can't keep casting evil magic without turning evil.

It /is/ evil. That it isn't, is just nonsense invented by edgy fanfics.

Like dude, it's not "dark" and evil because Rowling arbitrarily declared it such. Dark Magic is Evil because it's all about the Bad Juju.

What about the concept of a curse spell intended for murder where hatred is a prerequisite and butchering your soul is a consequence sounds not horrible? Or the ones specifically intended for torturing and enslaving other people? Or that "Drink of Despair" potion, that causes both physical and mental anguish in its drinker? Or the resurrrection ritual Voldy did, featuring fun stuff like graverobbing and mutilation of both yourself and others? Or the Sectumsempra curse whose effect is straight-up maiming people?

What about any of this sounds morally grey and tragically understood?

***** Holy crap this was while ago.

Canonically, dark magic /is not/ evil. Dark magic has been classified as any magic that harms. Not everything that harms is evil. Your headcanon is dark magic is evil because it is all about bad juju, but we are talking about canon in which not all dark magic is evil, but all evil magic is dark.

It doesn't matter if Rowling arbitrarily decided what is considered dark magic, that is how things get brought up when coming up with ideas for a story. She had decided that any magic that harms is dark magic. Just because something is harmful, does not make it evil.

There are a ton of dark magic that is used in canon, any jinx/hex/curse no matter how minor is classified, canonically, as dark magic. If you think Anti-Intruder Jinx, which is classified as dark magic, is evil, then sure, you have an extremely broad view of evil magic. In which case, for you *all* dark magic is evil. But probably for a majority of people, something so minor in the darker spectrum, would not be evil.

I never said that wasn't evil. Everything you listed can definitely be seen as evil, I am not arguing otherwise. I am arguing that dark magic does not automatically equate to evil per canon. If you choose to decide dark magic is evil, that is headcanon and that is fine. Just don't argue that in canon, all dark magic is evil. The fact is, dark magic is just a classification, dark magic just is.

What about indirect things like levitating a club above someone's head and dropping it? What about a simple tripping or stinging jinx?

**** The unforgivable cursed are cstegorized that way because of the intent of the caster. There is nowhere in the book that even points to Avada Kedavra being used for euthanasia.

Avada Kedavra needs a muderous intent. And so does Crucio (intent of torture) There are multiple instances of this being explained in the book.

In short i think that dark magic!=evil but all magic that is 'evil' is dark magic. For example sll curses are "dark" but not all of them are evil (Reducto curse is the best example)

**** First and foremost, in the context of the rules stated above, most uses of the Imperius curse horribly break rule 2.

Second, the whole point is that "Dark magic is about intent".

What you seem to be ignoring is that many people find mind control to be inherently evil in almost all situations. Sure there is the one off "I could totally use it to stop someone from jumping off a building" excuse used in countless bits of fan fiction, but most people look at it and see all the myriad opportunities for abuse.

So far as we know, it does not directly cause harm, however, consider some of the best advice for implementing a new piece of magic or technology in your story. What was its original intent? How will it be abused? How will this affect the richest in society? How will it affect the poorest? How can it be marketed? What will the black market look like?

Sure, with the imperius, you could conceivably have some sort of therapeutic use for psychologists, but I can't see many more benign uses for it.

As I've stated, so far as we know, it does no direct harm (I'd be interested in a study of dopamine overdose in relation to this). However, the potential abuse is far too high to classify it as anything but dark.

But of all the spells the three unforgivables are one of the main ones set as both dark and evil and for good reason. Imperio /is/ bad. It doesnt cause physical harm but certainly causes psychological harm, and requires the will of the caster to dominate that of the victim. And if you don't think that is harm, you need to reevaluate some things man.

Not to mention that if the caster tells thr victim to kill himself and/or harm another it is causing /both/ types of harm.

** Magic seems to be more about skill and capability than anything. We know from canon that not everyone can throw around a killing curse. Crouch Jr. pretty much implies its difficult to actually cast. The Cruciatus and Imperius Curse are likewise difficult to cast successfully, and much of this seems to depend upon the person. Bellatrix, for instance, seems to prefer the Cruciatus Curse and have a talent for it.

So why use all those other spells? Possibly its because those curses are /hard and require a certain mentality/ to work correctly. You need to want to dominate someone to use the Imperius Curse. You need to want to enjoy the pain to cast the Cruciatus Curse.

Plus, much like in muggle combat and warfare, you should never underestimate the twin dragons of surprise and shock value. People know what the killing curse looks like, but how many people know what a vein shattering curse looks like, or how to treat it? Not to mention, and this is important, dark wizards in Harry Potter are more like /terrorists/. You want to go for visually flashy and horrifying. Dead bodies are a lot more scary when they're covered in lacerations and a look of utter fear adorns their faces.

In short, yes you can accomplish a lot of the same things with an /incendio/ or a /diffindo/, but its not quite as frightening when everyone knows how to do that. Using dark magic is about stepping outside the acceptable and mundane of magical society. Finding the taboo and weird and turning it against the lay people. Its not a good thing, but how many people in history have been fascinated to pursue things that the general public recoiled at?

For the Cruciatus, you know, clue's in the name. The Killing Curse is imo a bit trickier to fit into the unforgivables though. In a way it could even be thought of as merciful, since it causes instant and painless death as opposed to, say, cutting their heads off with a Severing Charm. The unforgivable part of the Avada Kedavra in my mind is the mindset required to cast the spell, as it requires a feeling of hatred and promotes negative thinking like that.

Other Dark Magic requires 1 things: Intent

Any spell in the Harry Potter universe could with the right use, mindset and intent kill a person (a fact i feel is greatly underused in fanfiction). A Wingardium Leviosa can be used to drop a rock from a height almost certainly killing a person by splattering their brains everywhere. You can banish a rock at a person, Bombarda is obvious, the list goes on and on. The Oppugno Jinx is a favorite of mine just for the sheer possibilities of how you can kill a person with it. So how do you separate using a Severing Charm to cut off some rope and a Severing Charm to cut off a head? Intent! If you perform a spell with the intention of hurting someone that in my mind makes it Dark Magic.

However there are exceptions. Spells that are made for the sole purpose of hurting people. I can't really imagine using, say, Fiendfyre for any good reason other than pure destruction.

** Easy, dark magic is obscure magic which threathens the ministry of magic's control. It is also all magic you don't want the majority to have access to because of plot reasons. Also, it is obscure because it is dark magic. Which is banned. Which makes it obscure.

  What is your definition of dark magic?
#+end_quote

The same as the canon definition: Magic that by 'virtue' of itself and what it does is Bad Juju, that can't actually do anything remotely good.

Like that one spell where you need to summon up your hatred of another in order to kill them, the act of which will rip your own soul apart. Or the torture and enslavement curses. Or that one drink of bodily and mental anguish that Dumbledore drank. Or the resurrection ritual where you need to go for graverobbing and mutilation. Etcetera.

** > But in canon, Dumbledore explicitly stated that Avada Kedavra used for euthanasia would not harm one's soul.

When does he say this? I do not remember it.

For me, Unforgivables are banned because they required malicious intent for the spell to work. This is backed by canon with the Cruciatus curse. It takes a certain sort of mindset to fuel the curses. I doubt the killing curse could be used for any reason but murder.

Dark magic is whatever the Ministry of Magic (and other wizarding governments) decide it to be. There is no separate 'dark magic' branch we often see in fanon, and it is certainly not addicting. I always assumed Dark Magic is usually based on intent and emotions, which makes it finicky and problematic.

As for people using Dark Magic, I wouldn't be surprised if people use it more and more as time goes on, because once you get in that mindset (of anger, depression, hate, etc), it becomes easier and easier. Dark magic, to me, is powerful yet dangerous. It's not like a drug where it is physically addicting, but is a way of releasing your anger and frustrations to the world. A happy and content person could not fuel a dark arts spell just like Voldemort or someone depraved could make a Patronous.

  "Certainly not. You must kill me."

  There was a long silence, broken only by an odd clicking noise. Fawkes the phoenix was gnawing a bit of cuttlebone.

  “Would you like me to do it now?” asked Snape, his voice heavy with irony.

  “Or would you like a few moments to compose an epitaph?”

  “Oh, not quite yet,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “I daresay the moment will present itself in due course. Given what has happened tonight,” he indicated his withered hand, “we can be sure that it will happen within a year.”

  “If you don't mind dying,” said Snape roughly, “why not let Draco do it?”

  “That boy's soul is not yet so damaged,” said Dumbledore. “I would not have it ripped apart on my account.”

  “And my soul, Dumbledore? Mine?”

  “You alone know whether it will harm your soul to help an old man avoid pain and humiliation,” said Dumbledore. “I ask this one great favor of you, Severus, because death is coming for me as surely as the Chudley Cannons will finish bottom of this year's league. I confess I should prefer a quick, painless exit to the protracted and messy affair it will be if, for instance[...]”

**** This doesn't support the claim. As a Desth Eater, Snape should have been forced to use at least on of the unforgivables abd he can certainly force the mindset of murderous intent for Avada Kedavrs to work.

  “If you don't mind dying,” said Snape roughly, “why not let Draco do it?”

  “That boy's soul is not yet so damaged,” said Dumbledore. “I would not have it ripped apart on my account.”

  “And my soul, Dumbledore? Mine?”

  For me, this reads that Dumbledore doesn't want Malfoy to try to use the killing curse because it means Malfoy will need to initialize the darker emotions in his soul. The reason he is asking Snape is because Dumbledore knows Snape can tap into those darker emotions that are lurking beneath the surface.

  Snape understands the Dark Arts, and the Mind Arts, well enough that he can hate Dumbledore for a moment in order to cast the curse. I still believe when Snape cast the Killing Curse, he absolutely meant it for that second. I do not think you can think of 'saving someone from misery' and cast the curse. After all, fake!Moody told the class about the Unforgivables intent, and how none of the students would be able to give him more than a nose bleed.

** I prefer the idea that dark magic isn't more powerful, but easier to learn and use. You need far less skill to use the Killing Curse than a Cutting Curse - all you really need is to really hate your target.

As far as the drawbacks of dark magic are concerned, I usually run with this: Since you need to feel hatred, a desire to subjugate and dominate and hurt others etc. to cast it, they tend to corrupt you, not only affecting your emotions negatively, but also making you more emotional over time, more prone to act without thinking.

**** That fits the same mould, so to speak - you could have the same effect without the sacrifices, but it would be (much, much) more difficult, and/or take much more time. Which would put it beyond the capabilities of any but the most gifted wizards or witches.

** In what I tried to define, dark magic was magic inherent only to dark mages, because those were easier to explain through what was ready at moment.

--------------

But in laymans terms(though, not a complete explanation), it is magic of high stakes and going "outside" of what one can call normal.

Going by this, those are *very* dangerous but equally rewarding to those who success at it. Like, I dunno, a russian roulette where you have 3 bullets, an empty chamber, panacea pill and you dont know what is in the last.

Yeah, it'd be a good metaphor if not for 3/1/1/1 chances. In reality, those are more... multiple?.. and are not available to be known.

But yeah, doesnt fit canon division.
