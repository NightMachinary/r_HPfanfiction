I'm writing a Harry Potter fanfic and would like to ask you about something that's bothering me:

if you transfigure an apple into a ceramic object and leave it for a long time like this, will it rot or when you return the apple to its original appearance will it continue the same as when you used the magic?

google translate


** There's some debate on how exactly Transfiguration works, as canon is unclear on the finer points. I say the apple would be intact, but others would disagree.

*** I would agree here. In the other thread, it's said that transfiguration changes the basic molecular structure of a thing. So, apple to ceramic object, it ceases being an apple and no longer has any apple-like properties. Then, converting it back to an apple would restore it to its last known apple state. If that was fresh, then it would be fresh and same as if it were rotten. It strikes me that this would be an excellent method for preserving/transporting food for a long journey. Simply transfigure the supplies into a sheaf of paper or something else small and light.

**** True. Admittedly, that rarely comes up for wizards because why go through a long journey at all when you can use a Portkey? But yes, excellent idea.

***** See, this could have come in handy when they were on the Horcrux hunt. Brightest witch of her age and she didn't even think of basic sustenance? Also, I'm sure a restored Sunday Roast would be much better than reconstituted freeze-dried stew on backpacking trips!

****** JKR really missed an opportunity here. Ron should have been making the meals. Of the three of them, I'd give him the best chance of transfiguring enjoyable meals from acceptable sources, just because it would be more important to him to get it right. His visualization of the end product would be more precise. Also, if Ron had been the one making the meals, his absence would have been more painfully felt by Harry and Hermione.

**** Do they ever transfigure something that was food back to food? Gamp's Law says you can't make food. So if that apple became a ceramic paper weight then it could never be reverted to food again?

If I was in world I'd think Gamp's Law was a bit bunk and its just really hard to make food or they're just not going about it the right way.

***** You can't make food, but you can make animals. Nothing stops you from making an ox, for exemple, and then cook it.\\
Also, ending a transfiguration isn't the same as transfiguring something. As I see it, if you transfigure an apple into a ceramic paper, you won't be able to transfigure it back into an apple, but you should be able to untransfigure it back into it's initial state, which happen to be an apple.\\
I don't see why the apple would've rot, though, as it wasn't an apple anymore before the transfiguration is cancelled.

***** I understand it as you can't turn something that didn't start out as food into food. So like you have a cord of wood, which is great for staying warm, but you can't transfigure it into a cord of bread. But, say you're going on a long hike and you have all of your food for the week and it's heavy. I would think that you could transfigure it into something much lighter and smaller--bird feathers, paper, dandelion fluff--and when you get hungry, simply cancel the transfiguration and have your ham sandwich back. That way, it's just a case of restoring something to its natural configuration.

**** If transfiguration is that way, would not it be easier if they transfigured any object for food?

***** It's directly stated in the books that you can't just transfigure any object into food.

Deathly Hallows

Maybe you should reread them (and read side-materials) before attempting to write a fanfic. It's a poor fan who doesn't even know the thing that he is supposed to be a fan of.

****** law of Gamp I already knew it. I was just commenting that if the theory he had spoken was true, that law would be wrong.

******* Why? I see no contradiction. It's quite possible that molecular structure of food is not all that is needed for it to be true food. It's the world running on magic which is based on concepts, there can be an inherent "foodiness" to food. Also, it's barely a theory, Rowling stated that [[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/1998/1298-herald-simpson.html]["With a charm you add properties to something. With a transfiguration you change its nature completely; the molecular structure alters..."]]

** It can be either. Its magic. It doesn't have to make sense, heck canon magic isn't even particularly consistent. There is enough leeway that you can make it work either way. For example, the students petrified in the 2nd book didn't need food and were fine waking up but nobody ever mentions them being younger by a couple of months.

** I like to think it would go back to exactly how it was before. Going along with another comment here, it's not just the Apple being transfigured, it's all the microbes along with it, all the non biological gases and the water... The total sum that makes up the Apple gets transfigured, and it returns to exactly what it was beforehand, like a save state.

** I would say that transfiguration in some regards should work along the lines of equivalent exchange a la FMA. Objects going from something of comparable size and shape to the other object shouldn't have an issue, and in most cases of the spell intends a permanent outcome there should be no reversal. However, living beings, be they sentient or not, or something going from small to large, or large to small, are always temporary and will either revert in the case of being small to large, or are reversable via spell for anything else. Though the difference can also be drawn on whether you are attempting to transfigure or transmute, the latter being permanent in every situation.

*** There's no canon evidence that transfiguration isn't permanent. I like to think that it always is unless the transfiguration is cancelled.
