Any fics that involve Harry going back to Hogwarts and his friends not recognising him.

Its a clich√©, but i dont see it a lot. (He says that now but he will probably be proven wrong soon enough)

Preferably I would like to see something along the lines of Harry getting a good exercise routine over the holidays, new clothes etc


** Oh lord I hate that cliche so damn much. linkffn(8937860) probably the least shitty of them, and pretty much pokes fun at the cliche.

  The summer prior to 6th year Harry deals with Tom in a decisive, if accidental manner. That summer Harry gets a girl friend in Susan Bones, and sets about some self improvement. It is after this change to himself he discovers something a bit disturbing about the Wizarding World, something that Hermione Granger is determined to use to her advantage.

**** Well, hello stranger," Susan Bones said as she flowed into his arms, and leaned up for a kiss. "Sorry ladies, I saw him first."

Um, no, this instantly turned me off from that fic. You would NOT DO that with a STRANGER.

***** Well if you read just a few more paragraphs you would have realized that they have been dating and she said that because nobody recognized him she was just playing off that.
