  "Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?" ...Snape kicks Harry out of 'Remedial Potions', but as we know from The Philosopher's Stone, there is another Occlumens in the school good enough to keep out the Dark Lord. Stupid oneshot.

**** Jeezus, can you imagine if Hagrid trained for UFC everyday with dedicated practice? The book referenced his hands are as large as trash cans. This dude is fucking huge, and the movies seriously underplayed just how big the actual character is.
