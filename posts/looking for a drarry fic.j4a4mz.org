i vaguely remember draco running away from home and ending up in the forest while the golden trio are looking for horcruxes. once they find him they kinda capture and torture him for answers as to why he's there and etc. i've been searching for this fic for a while now but i can't seem to find it anywhere :( oh ++ ron and harry get pretty violent with draco while hermione is set with the task of feeding him? thank you!

*** unfortunately it isn't temptation though it's an amazing fic :[[ they find draco in the forest and are more unapologetic towards beating draco up (which was one of those heavy details i believe i remember xd) and nope no dramione!! hermione was completely cold towards draco and didn't hesitate to take draco's meals away from him. i've looked through a couple masterlists and rec pages but i couldn't find anything like it. it was a good fic and i was hoping to reread it :]

**** Well damn did you ever figure it out? Sounds hella good. The one bone i had to pick with Temptation.. As well as the one other well known Drarry fic I read.... Was that Hermione was WAY too supportive of the relationship and I found that part to be the most un-canon-like. Her and Ron would flip shit. They'd come around but itd take both of them a loooong time.
