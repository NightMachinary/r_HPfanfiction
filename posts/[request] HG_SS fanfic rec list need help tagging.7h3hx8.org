Hello,

A couple of years ago I started a list of fanfics I really liked because there were some old stories I couldn't find anymore. The idea being that with the list I could find them again in the future. The list grew quite long (this is only the hp section, of which most is hg/ss) and I figured I could share it with other people who are looking for a specific fic or just a good one based on the summary.

Recently I've been adding detailed tags so people can search for keywords if they're interested in reading a certain kind of fic. However, to know the correct tags I've been rereading a lot of them. That's a lot of â€˜work' and will take a long time.

So I'm looking for people who have perhaps recently read, or are willing to reread, some of the fics in the list and make a comment on the google spreadsheet to add tags.

At this time I'm not looking for additions to the list, I just want to complete the list I have now. Additions can be considered after.

To add tags:

Normally you should be able to comment on the spreadsheet, or you can always mail me. My email can be found on the spreadsheet.

Which tags? Please check the existing tags and use those if applicable before using new ones.

** I can't comment on the sheet. I think you haven't enabled it (currently it's "view only").

I can only help with one though: Ordinary People, by Hayseed.

Characters: Hermione, Snape.

Genre: Drama, Romance.

Time/Location: 7th Year, Hogwarts, during war (perhaps note that it was written pre-HBP so is technically AU? dunno if you're bothering with that)

Tags: Magical biochemistry, bit of magical history (Hermione translates an old journal that provides some plot-relevant information, but I wouldn't say it's very history focused)
