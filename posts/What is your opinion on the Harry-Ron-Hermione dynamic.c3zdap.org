Odds are, if you frequent this subreddit, you enjoyed the Harry Potter books. The trio's friendship is such a large part of these books and yet there are a good number of people on this sub and even more in the general fan fiction community who seemingly do not enjoy it. Certain popular tropes indicate, such as Indy!Harry or Evil/Idiot!Ron, that there is a certain disdain for one, two, or even all three of the canon books main characters.

In searching [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]], in which there are over 807,000 stories, there are only 7.1k which tag Harry, Hermione, and Ron all in the same story. That is 0.8%, which is absolutely minuscule.

*Semi related point/fun fact*: The trio in Naruto, second largest collection of stories on ffn.net, show up in a greater percentage of stories individually compared to Harry Potter. This is likely due to the greater variety of characters for Harry Potter however.

What is your opinion on the Harry/Ron/Hermione dynamic?

Enjoy it?

Enjoy it, but rather read something different?

Hate it?


** I saw a post on tumblr somewhere that said something like “the Golden trio works because they're all the awkward third wheel.”

I think that's my favorite part about them. They each have a different dynamic with each other, and that's what makes them so strong.

I personally love Ron. Yeah he can be a bit jerky at times, but he's a teenager. His best friend is the savior of the world, he's the second youngest of 7 kids, and the girl he likes is super close with his best friend. He's going to have moments when he feels inferior, invisible, not listened to, or not good enough. And I think that would make anyone act like a dick sometimes.

But he's always there when it matters. He is constantly following Harry into danger, standing up for him when others are bullying him, gives him insight when he can't figure something out, and he's just genuinely an amazing friend.

** Ron is a character with issues. Lots of fanfic writers are aware of this.

Harry and Hermione are also characters with issues. Lots of fanfic authors forget this.

I will admit to not enjoying writing Ron very much (though I really dislike writing male characters in general), but I think lots of authors can do better than just bashing Ron if they don't want him to have a role in their fic. At the very least, it's more than possible to make Ron a minor character without making him a complete ass.

I also think a lot of hate is directed towards him by Harmony fans, as his canon relationship with Hermione makes them perceive him as an obstacle to their ship that has to be removed for the story to work.

Basically sums up the fandom. I don't have a problem with Ron bashing, but only if there is enough Hermione and Harry bashing to go along with it. For every 1000 Ron bashing fics, theres two Harry bashing fics and maybe one Hermione bashing fic. It gets really old, really fast.

*** It also shows the blatant sexism for many people. Hermione does something bad - birds or not admitting your cat ate your poor friend's rat, it's ok, girl power and under stress. Ron has 2 fights with Harry and playfully insults get every once in a while, and he's a death eater and an abuser. Ron was not a horrible influence on Harry. They were best friends, and Harry had no parents to show his report card too. His motivation was not as strong. He's a kid. Not everyone is like a Hermione.

The same guy who sacrificed himself multiple times, took Harry in despite being poor, put his family in danger, and took precautions to protect them, and much more.

Hermione well - showoff, socially inept, hubris, etc

And Ron's abandonment - well in GOF, Harry and Ron talked about entering together and then his name comes out. I would be upset. But Harry doesn't say I'm likely to die nor does Hermione tell Harry that, just assumes he's jealous. Ron saw the danger Harry was in, and realized he would have not have done it then. Apologized like a friend. Second time in DH, Harry was a shit leader. Incompetent. Ron heard reports about his family, he was worried combined with the hocrux and it amplified it. Ron has the most to lose, and Harry kicked him out. Ron tried to come back the minute he left, like a cool down, but he couldn't, and then does and saves his life.

Sigh...

**** Well, in my main fic, Scrambled Sorting, everyone's put in different houses. Ron's a minor character who's in Hufflepuff and is friends with Wayne Hopkins and Susan Bones, while Harry and Hermione are in Slytherin and are friends with Tracey Davis and Daphne Greengrass.

** One of the reason for Ron lack of representation is that ff.net only let you tag 4 characters. So unless the Trio friendship is one of the main aspects of the fic, like in The-Sum-Of-Their-Parts, people will only tag the main or mains characters, and their ship. Sadly, their is a lot less Ron centric fic than Harry or Hermione centric (I blame the movie ), and for some reason, Harron (if this word even exist ) doesnt have as many shipper than Harmony.

Add at that the people who bash Ron and the ones who put Hermione on a pedestal (often the same people ), and Ron has a lot less positive representation in fanfics.

*** And it used to be that you could only tag two characters. There are a lot of older fics with only two characters listed, even if it'd be more accurate to add a third and/or fourth.

** Of course I enjoy it, as their dynamic is one of the best part of the original series.

My greatest disappointment in the Movies is that they bashed Ron into a stupid jerk, made Hermione into a perfect Mary Sue, and basically destroyed the importance of the Trio.

My top fics generally feature nice Trio interactions, among them our sub favorites [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/][Seventh Horcrux]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(10677106;11858167).

** I'm okay with the dynamic until like book 5. That's when everyone starts getting on my nerves, though.

Ron is bashed more than the other 2, because, again, people haven't read the series in years. Ron was Harry's best friend and they both didn't like Hermione in PS. He also didn't mind not speaking to her until he got his broom back. If Ron isn't there, Harry isn't friends with Hermione for too long.

** I do actually like the dynamic alot in the books. I do remember times when i didn't but those usually stand out to me because I liked their dynamic so much the rest of the time that it hurt when i didnt like it.

I know the movies were terrible for Rons character. Even if you read the books his depiction in the movies could perhaps make you like him less than you would otherwise.

That being said I dont think the lack of fics is because dont like the friendship. I think its just people wanna explore different things in fanon and their frienship was explored alot in canon. Also fics tend to be ship centric so that could be another reason.

Im sure there are those who had issues with one or more of the 3 and thats part of the reason too but i don't think thats the main reason

** In the books, the three have a decent balance of power between them. They are effectively a brains/brawn duo with the brains split out into detail oriented (Hermione) and big picture (Ron). The problem is that everything Ron brings to the table was difficult to get across in the condensed format of a movie so many people forget about his redeeming qualities.

Another problem is that Harry/Hermione shipping is very popular (I am a shipper myself) and there is the inevitable problem of what to do with Ron if you are using this ship. A skilled writer might be able to introduce a nuanced change that leaves them still as a functioning trio but the relationships changed slightly. Unfortunately, the majority of fanfiction writers are not that skilled and resort to contriving some excuse to remove Ron or simply ignore him.

The end result is that Ron has been horribly neglected by the Fandom. I can think of small handful that I feel portray their full trio dynamic well, but unfortunately they are few and far between. What fics are out there seem to treat the trio relationship as secondary to other big events happen.

** Wow. Can't believe Sasuke shows up more than Naruto. Now for the topic at hand, I enjoy the Harry/Ron/Hermione dynamic. When the three are interacting together I like Ron the most usually. Harry and Hermione get caught up in whatever topic they're talking about and Ron can help keep everyone's moods up. Individually, I like Harry the most. I like reading fics with the dynamic between Harry and Ron the most, then the whole trio after that. I'm also ok with Harry and Hermione centric, but its not my preferred.
