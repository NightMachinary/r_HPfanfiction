Hi!

I have been reading a lot of canon continuation fanfiction from after DH, unfortunately all stop short after a year or two after the war. I am looking for a fanfic that not only tells the story from right after but also about harry and ginny and hermione and ron getting married and having kids.

I would like their jobs included too especially with Ron and Harry being Aurors.

I found a great fanfic encompassing all of this but unfortunately it was left unfinished.

I'm not ready to read any fan fic that strays from canon as of yet.

Thanks!


** You want the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Ninteen Years and Beyond series by Northumbrian.]] It starts before the period you're interested in, but you can start reading it anywhere.

*** That is exactly what I wanted to suggest. And I usually recommend people to start at linkao3(Tales of the Battle by Northumbrian) and then just go on.
