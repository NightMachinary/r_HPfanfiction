:END:
I'm looking for at specific severitus fic. Hopefully you can help me. I remember that lily charmed Harry so he looked like James and on Harry 16. Birthday Harry got a letter from lily telling Harry that Snape is really Harry's father. It was something about him being under the imperius by Lucius Malfoy to drug and have sex with lily. Later in the story, the two of them form a good relationship and Harry doesn't want Snape to be alone against Voldemort as a spy so Snape introduces his son to Voldemort (with a new identity of course) I think his new name became Adrian or Dorian or something. Later in the story the ministry finds out Harry/Adrian is a death eater and there's a trial and all where both Snape and Harry is under veritaserum. I hope one of you can help me find the fanfic :) (Sorry for bad English)


** I feel like I started reading this and never completed it. Hmm. I'm sorry I can't be more helpful.
