Only for Harry's responce to be: "I'm hearing voices that nobody else can. It's finally happened, the Dursleys have driven me insane." Any further attempts at interaction are only met with Harry's increasing conviction that he's finally gone bonkers, ideally delivered with sass, cheek, and sarcasm.


** /"Potter... Potterr..."/ whispered the voice.

"Don't respond to the voices, the book said. oh good god, what the hell do I do? Do I tell someone? What does the wizarding world do with the mentally ill?"

Visions of the long-term care ward at St. Mungo's flitter through his mind, complete with Harry himself locked in a small, padded room.

"Alrighty, not telling anyone. Good plan."

/"Potteerrrrr..."/

--------------

/"Use a twist, Potterrr... not a flick...."/

The voices had changed their tune. Harry wasn't sure if this was good or bad - occasionally they would tell him to do things.

/Don't do what the voices tell you, that was also in the book./

Harry continued to flick his wand.

--------------

/"Answer me, boy... speak..."/

The voices were becoming more and more insistent. He had to tell someone. But who?

/"Pottttterrrrrr...."/

--------------

/"Don't tell them, potterrr...."/

"So you're hearing voices? Could it he parseltongue, like in second year?" asked Hermione.

"Yeah mate, maybe Voldemort set his snake on you to drive you nuts or something."

/"snaaaaake..."/

"Nah, it doesn't sound like parseltongue. Not enough hissing. I think I might be insane."

--------------

/"Don't go... you moron..."/

Harry ignored the voice as he walked into the forest.

/"It's a trap... idiot boy..."/

--------------

A flash of light, and he was gone, finding himself in a misty, grey place.

Harry prepared for the voice, but was shocked when it came from behind him.

"What part of 'it's a trap, you idiot' didn't you understand?!" shouted an emaciated-looking Tom Riddle as he was dragged off by two floating beings in flowing, white coats.

** This one kinda fits. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1717240]]

Description: After dying in the forbidden forest at Voldemort's hand--after going to the Kings Cross of his afterlife--Harry is returned to his 11-year-old self with no memories of his life before, just a vague sense of doom and weird knowledge of the wizarding world (and its inhabitants) that he can't quite explain. With only his ever-present sense of deja-vu to guide him into making better choices than last time, Harry embarks on a journey to save the wizarding world once again, and this time save himself as well.
