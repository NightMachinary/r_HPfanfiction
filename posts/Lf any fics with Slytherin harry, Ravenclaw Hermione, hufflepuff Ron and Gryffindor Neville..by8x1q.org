      Hufflepuff Ron

    Hufflepuff values loyalty highest

  Ron betrays "best friend" repeatedly

/Error 405/

If anything, Neville would be Hufflepuff, and Ron would stay Gryffindor... Assuming canon, or close-to-canon personality

**** I know right! I swear every time he has a bright idea, it's either a shamelessly stolen idea from someone else or he almost literally has the answer handed to him on a silver platter... and I mean it's been a while since I read the canon books, but I honestly can't remember a single mention of him doing his homework (well, other than complete bogus stuff for divination) in the books without either blatantly copying Hermione's work or basically having her turn into a drill sergeant and force him to do it, he's definitely more the type to attempt to find the "Easy way out" for everything...

  COMPLETE! Hermione's eighth year at Hogwarts is already going to be difficult in the aftermath of the war, but it is further thrown into upheaval when Headmistress McGonagall orders a re-sorting of all students to promote inter-house unity. But when the Sorting Hat sends Hermione to Ravenclaw with Draco - and without Harry or Ron - how will she cope? [AU, Dramione] Prevalent alchemy.
