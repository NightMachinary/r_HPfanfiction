I swear it was titled something like "The Wards of Hogwarts" or "Hogwarts Wards", but neither search gets me anywhere.

Basically the story went like this: Harry starts falling for Draco, but Draco is pretty controlling. It starts off innocently, like Draco making Harry jump on one foot, kissing him, etc. and then he becomes progressively more dark until Harry is 100% obedient to him. Eventually he's locked up in Draco's room/tower for most of the time. In the end it was a scheme for Draco to open up a portal through the wards at Hogwarts to bring in more Deatheaters, etc. I think he eventually wipes Harry's memory clean and keeps him as his little oblivious pet.

I read it on fanfiction.net but it doesn't seem to be there anymore.

Any ideas where I can find this again?? It is killing me. Thank you.


** I don't know the fic you're talking about (sorry!), but I just want to say how glad I am to see a slash request that hasn't been downvoted. This sub sometimes, man.

*** Thanks! I'm glad as well.

Do you think there is a way to retrieve an old story that has been deleted? If only I had the link to the story I could try using the wayback machine... (crying)

**** The only way would be if some forward-thinking reader downloaded it before the deletion, and would be willing to share a pdf. Maybe you could try asking in more active drarry communities? Tumblr and livejournal, for example.
