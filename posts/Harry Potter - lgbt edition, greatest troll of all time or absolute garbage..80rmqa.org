Was just trying to find new fic and came across this absolute travesty. I'm not sure if this is the best troll of all time or cancer.

Discuss.

On mobile so no link sorry.


** I think it's really funny, but also shows a nasty side of this community: There's a 99% chance that it's a joke and all those hateful reviews are completely unnecessary. There's also a tiny chance that it is actually genuine, which means there's a somewhat disturbed young girl writing it, making the reviews kinda despicable.

  "Who are you?" asked Harry questiondly, a cute blonde smirk appearing from his lips. Dobby began to crunch and then jumped into the sofa.

  "My name's Dobby, sir. Dobby Malfoy. I'm the illiterate son of Lucius Malfoy and Tom Riddle. I'm their adoptive son!" explained Dobby secretly, having a steal at one of the chocolate cupcakes Dudley was helping himself to earlier. "I've come here today to warn you something very dangerous!"
