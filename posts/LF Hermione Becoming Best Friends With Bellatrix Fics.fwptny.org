I'm just wondering if there are any fics where Hermione travels back in time and maybe under the guise of being a pureblood, gets sorted into Slytherin or Ravenclaw, or even back in Gryffindor, and develops a good friendship with Bellatrix?

I'm really interested in stories where this happens and it's /not/ a Bellamione story, since they obviously become friends before the romance in those, and I'd love to see a story with a different pairing that has Bellatrix as Hermione's sidekick almost :p

I'm also down for some Bellamione fics, as I'm looking for some as well!

Multi chapter, 60k+ words preferred! Thank you! :)


** Time Heals All Wounds (my fav Bellamione fic) fits that description pretty well
