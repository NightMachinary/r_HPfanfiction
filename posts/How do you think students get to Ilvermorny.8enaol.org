I'm assuming a train, but my fic takes place in the 1860's when trains were still fairly new, and we know muggle technology is slow to be adopted by wizards.

I couldn't decide on a single method so I just used a variety of methods, my favorite being an enchanted skeleton carrying an enchanted carpetbag that has room for four students on the inside.

** Hike, take a bus, ride bicycles -- just look like a hippie and be sure to pick up any strays on the road if they're wearing cranberry with blue. Travel like tourists in the Berkshires, gathering at the War Memorial tower atop Mount Greylock. When you arrive and are ready to go, stand in front of the tower where a grumpy short guy will take a photo with an unusually bright flash -- and then you're gone.

** I like to think they ride in a zeppelin. Seems about right especially in the 1910s and 1920s where they were very popular in the US.

** So apparently nobody knows you are asking about the 1860s...

Before the advent of the train, I've thought carriages were the likely use for people, including wizards, to travel. Perhaps having them be thestral-drawn they were equipped to fly which would certainly make it much faster and, importantly in the U.S., able to cover a lot more ground.

I also think the vastness of the U.S. was not much of an issue for wizards in the 1800s. I imagine most of the Ilvermony students were based on the east coast. While the country was expanding west, I imagine the wizarding world was not as eager to move west (many western expanders were moving because they had no opportunity in the east; wizards I imagine found it easier). I also think there were some territorial beefs with Native American tribes seeped in magic that may have tampered down the wizard expansion to the west. For those that did move west, I imagine many of those wizarding families were explorers and nonconformists who were more likely to homeschool their children.

*** IIRC, there were some Native American students at Ilvermorny in the early years, though I'd think by the 1860's they'd stop associating with non-Native wizards, on the account of white people being complete dicks.

I think most wizards outside of the east coast would be homeschooled, but if they were muggleborn they'd have to be taken to Ilvermorny, to prevent Obscurials from wreaking havoc.
