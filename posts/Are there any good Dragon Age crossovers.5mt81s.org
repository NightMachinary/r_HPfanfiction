I've recently gotten back into Dragon Age, and it strikes me that having someone like Harry coming from a setting with high amounts of very liberal magic usage, to one where magic is far more limited in both scope and acceptability would be interesting to read. Just the social ramifications of entering a world where everyone knows magic exists, but it's basically illegal would be fun to explore.

I'm partial to Dragon Age 2's time frame, but I'm not to concerned with the specifics of when and where the crossover takes place in the respective series. Slash is fine, and so is romance.


** I don't think I've ever actually seen someone who like DA2's timeline the most. That being said, there's a real scant amount of crossovers, none all that great. I suggest taking a look through AO3 since DA is a lot more popular there than on ffn.

*** Yeah, it's my favorite for a few reasons, though I can see why people didn't enjoy DA2 as much as other entries in the series. Personally, I really liked having the area and timeframe narrowed to just Kirkwall and the surrounding areas; it WAS limiting, but it also made you appreciate your supporting cast and Kirkwall all the more because you were there so much instead of running across a bunch of different places you only vaguely knew anything about or touched on. You really got to know the place and its people and its stories.

And I'll give A03 a look. I've been scrolling through it for pure DA fics the last few weeks; just wanted opinions on crossovers before slogging through tags myself.

**** Yeah. I guess it's not so much the DA2 timeline that is all that bad. I guess it's mostly just the game, and that sort of clouds my opinion on it as a whole. Anyways, I have literally skimmed every single HP/DA crossover on there (as of a few months ago) and none of them really stood out to me as memorable.

***** What exactly is it about DA2 that doesn't sit well with you if you dont mind me asking? I know people give the game flack for its controls and battle system, and its relative scale compared to the previous game, but no one is ever able to really tell me why they think its /bad/.

And that sucks. I might just end up having to write one if nothing good is out there; its a fun idea to explore I think. Having Harry dodging High Dragons and trying to keep off the radar of the circles seems like it'd be neat.

****** Not the person you were originally responding to, but I'll try to answer why DA2 was "bad".

Note that I put bad in quotations, mostly because DA2 had all the potential in the world to be the best game of the series. But what seemed to be a great, unconventional concept (a fantasy RPG taking place in one city detailing the rise and fall of one man/woman), was cut off at the knees by a short release cycle and publisher demands, and what we got instead was Dragon Age 2: a clearly rushed mishmash of cut-and-paste dungeons, a small and lifeless "city" in the place of Kirkwall, possibly the most tropey party out of any of the DA games, and a third act that practically falls out of the sky. This is ignoring the numerous complaints the game received for its battle system and controls, mind.

That's not to say the game is completely irredeemable. When DA2 is good, it's quite good (see Act II and a rare few of the story beats from Act I). But to get to all that, the game requires you to sit through anywhere from 10 to 15 hours of slogging through the same dungeon over and over again, or running through the same, bland sections of Kirkwall over and over again, and fighting wave-spawning enemies over and over again. Sure, that might not bother fans of the series too much, but the average gamer would be forgiven for seeing the worst of the game and never coming back.

Due to this, we saw Bioware revert to a concept more strongly modeled after Origins for DA Inquisition, most likely due to the backlash against DA2. But hopefully, with the success of The Witcher as an unconventional fantasy RPG series and EA toning down their moneygrabbing tendencies, Bioware might be willing to tackle an unconventional Dragon Age entry like DA2 again, with more time and funding.

** Linkffn(10001746) Hope's Calling is the only HP crossover that I've read. Harry is rather insane, but maybe you'll enjoy it anyway?

  The world has tried to break Harry before. Some days, at his most lucid, he wonders if it succeeded. Either way, he doesn't intend to take it lying down, but from Templars to demons, the trouble keeps coming. Oh and the world might be ending, although that, for once, is someone else's problem.

*** Is it well written at least? I realize characterization may be off given you saying Harry is insane, but i'm willing to overlook that if it's at least legible and a neat idea.
