  Gryffindor isn't what Slytherin sees in it, and the reverse is way more true than that. Lily Evans doesn't know she looks different depending where you're standing, the Blacks know exactly how they come across and like it that way, and Severus Snape isn't exactly who anyone thinks he is---least of all himself.

  *Canon Compliance*

  It is advised that the reader be familiar with the biography of Harry Potter written by Ms. Rowling. The reader should be aware that this seven-volume series was fact-checked by Ms. Skeeter rather than Miss Granger, and cannot be relied on in the matter of dates. Furthermore, Ms. Rowling's books are written from the point of view of the subject, and not only contain a distinctly pro-Gryffindor bias but largely confine themselves to what Mr. Potter saw, heard, assumed, and speculated.

  This is a Slytherin story, and truth is subjective.

  "Hmm." Harry hmmed hmmingly. "I dare say, Ron, this might be the most dangerous of situations we've ever been in." Ron yelped with love and loyalty and no betrayals. There was a rumbling sound that grew into a roar of destruction. A goddamned demon, or perhaps Beelzebub himself, Harry imagined. A forty thousand foot beast appeared on the horizon with an ugliness unmatched by anyone except Malfoy. The abomination raised its arm and tore the earth from its native orbit. Whether towards the sun or into deep space, Harry couldn't tell. Night became day, day became night. Over and over. There was the sound of screaming in Harry's ears. The voice held no identity and Harry was forced to assume it was all in his mind. Had he gone mad? Ron gave a yelp of fear and no betrayals. Suddenly Dumbledore appeared! "Accio, sun!" He bellowed with power and authority. Harry watched in awe as the wizened old motherfucker stabilized their orbit around the sun. The powerful wizard turned to face the approaching demon.

** /In which Lily discovers her secret glitch manipulating alter ego is actually a wizard drug lord, Wizard Lenin gets extremely frustrated and discouraged, and Death offers a warning./

As far back as Lily could remember, she had never celebrated her birthday. For a while, she hadn't been exactly sure when it was. It had only been pieced together after a few trips to the doctor's office as well as her registration for school. It was nothing like Dudley's birthdays. You'd think those would be a national celebration, what with the cake and the mound of presents and the few small child friends who were invited over while Lily was told to entertain herself somewhere far away from the party.

** Hermione's point of view:

#+begin_quote
  I have been staring at this ceiling for so long that I have actually counted the stones making it up. 152 black stones, all the same and yet subtly different in texture or surface or shape. 152 stones.

  That ceiling has been my one and only view for the past few hours. I haven't moved from my bed since my last toilet break. The straw pokes through my robes and scrapes and scratches my back, but I don't care. It's not as if I deserve comfort.

  On my last toilet break I scrubbed at my hands over the sink for as long as I was allowed, trying to get the blood off of them. And although I managed to wash it all away, I can't get rid of the smell. It should be disappearing with time, but it isn't. It just remains, growing stronger with every minute, soaking me to the skin, dirtying the air.

  I don't think I'll ever get the stench of the blood out of my nostrils.

  "Who's there?" Her voice came drifting out from behind the door. Severus hesitated and for a moment almost lost his nerve entirely.

  "Hello?" Her voice sounded closer, as if she were right on the other side of the door. Severus could hear music playing, something faint and sad.

  He put his hand on his wand. Just in case.

  "Lily," he said. "It's me. I mean - it's Severus."

  No answer except the music. Severus closed his eyes. His heart pounded like he was scared. He pressed his head against the door as he spoke. "Lily," he said. "Are you - hurt? I saw what happened at the pub - it wasn't me, I swear it, but if you're still hurt, I think I can heal you."

  The music stopped.

  "How did you know about my arm?" Her voice was right there, he could tell, and if there hadn't been a door between them he would have been close enough to kiss her.

  "I didn't," Severus said. "Until now. What's wrong with it?" A sudden, horrific thought dawned on him. "It hasn't fallen off, has it?"

** This is the randomest thing I've been asked today.

I love random.

#+begin_quote
  Hundreds of owls swooped into the Great Hall, a mid-air ocean of wings and letters. A few appreciative murmurs sounded from the Ravenclaw and Slytherin tables, where our foreign guests had sat down for breakfast. Most of the Hogwarts students barely noticed their descent, well used to the daily spectacle.

  A small, tawny owl landed in front of Hermione and held out the latest edition of the Prophet in a delicate claw. Hermione handed it a knut. The creature hooted approvingly but continued to loiter, eying our plates.

  I turned to Ron and explained, "It wants your bacon."

  "It's my bacon," he said mulishly. "There's a whole plate right over there. Why doesn't it take some from that?"

  "It probably enjoys eating it from your hand. Or maybe it just likes stealing," I said.

  He glared at the bird, which merely ruffled its feathers in response. I added, "I don't know why you're making such a big deal of this."

  Ron turned his glare on me. "Why don't you ever give up your bacon?"

  "Don't blame your selfishness on me," I said.

  "Just give it the bacon, Ronald," Hermione said absentmindedly as she opened up her newspaper. Scowling, Ron gave up the bacon. When he reached out to grab more from the central platter, it disappeared.

  Sometimes I love this castle.

  "Anything interesting in the news today?" I asked.

  "You really should get a subscription of your own," Hermione sniffed.

  "Everyone knows the Daily Prophet is full of rubbish."

  "It's very important to keep informed," she said.

  I shrugged. "I have people for that."

  Hermione raised an eyebrow. "You mean me?"

  "Well, yes, mostly you at the moment," I admitted.

  Back when I was a dark lord, I used to have a whole group of Death Eaters performing that task. I also had a group that dealt with public relations. My decision to put Bellatrix in the latter group probably explains why I was considered a dark lord and not a slightly over-zealous politician.

  Hermione's hands clenched the paper as her eyes darted from side to side. Suddenly, she slammed it against the table and hissed, "This is complete rubbish."

  "Yes, I just told you that," I said.

  "No, not the whole paper. Just this article. It's about you, and it's just so completely outlandish that I don't even know where to begin in refuting it. I...here."

  She shoved it at me, and I began to read.

  Boy-Who-Lived Rescues Reporter from Sirius Black

  By Rita Skeeter

  After thirteen years of silence, the Boy-Who-Lived has reentered the public sphere with a bang. Only fourteen years old, young Harry Potter is determined to win the Triwizard Tournament for Hogwarts. I had the privilege of sitting down with him yesterday for an exclusive interview.

  Though three years younger than the other champions (described in detail on page three), Harry has no lack of confidence, or -- it seems -- skill.

  "Oh, I'm definitely winning," he told me with a charming grin. "I wouldn't have entered otherwise...I have extensive experience with these sorts of things. I've successfully fought a deranged DADA Professor, lured Hagrid's monster out of its hiding place, and even faced a werewolf...I know well over two hundred spells, and I'm a runes prodigy."

  Any of this reporter's doubts were erased as the Boy-Who-Lived demonstrated several spells she remembers from her DADA NEWT.

  "You sound like a young Lockhart," I commented.

  At this, Harry's eyes filled with tears. "We can all hope to be as amazing as Lockhart."

  Soon, our conversation turned to Harry's unusual entrance into the tournament. You see, dear readers, Harry never should have been allowed to enter at all, but the protections set by Albus Dumbledore were no match for youthful ingenuity.

  "Oh, he tried to keep me out."

  The boy laughed mischievously and refused to say any more, only adding, "I'm a very typical Gryffindor, you know. The Hat didn't even consider anyplace else for me. Not for a single moment."

  I was fortunate enough to see Harry's boasted skills in action when a great beast suddenly leapt from the grass, landing upon the boy and pinning him to the floor. Enormous fangs poised to rip at his throat, but Harry blasted the monstrous creature away with a powerful spell.

  The beast landed hard against the grass, suddenly transforming into none other than Sirius Black. At first, panic shone in Harry's green eyes -- understandable since I, Rita Skeeter, nearly fainted upon Black's arrival. Within moments, however, Harry's face turned resolute and a rainbow of hexes and jinxes flew at the startled convict.

  Black fled, unable to cast a single spell (For more information on the battle between You-Know-Who's right-hand man and the Boy-Who-Lived, please turn to page two).

  While this reporter has no doubt in the abilities of Harry Potter, my wiser readers must wonder about Albus Dumbledore. Why was Sirius Black able to sneak into Hogwarts three times under Dumbledore's watch? How did a student, no matter his talent, outwit the old man's defenses? How did he allow Hagrid, a half-giant with a felonious past, to spend fifty years working in the halls he once terrorized, resulting in the death of Gilderoy Lockhart?

  Can we trust him with our children?

  I looked up in confusion at Hermione, who was busy stabbing a piece of omelet with her fork. I should emphasize the use of the word "stab" in this sentence...There was a dent left in the plate. "I don't understand why you're so upset. It's all true."

  Hermione raised an eyebrow. "You were attacked by Sirius Black?"

  "Yes," I said.

  "And you didn't tell anyone."

  "I'm not sure why I would bother. It's not like he came back or anything," I said, "and, frankly, I found him far less powerful than everyone seems to imply."

  "That's probly 'cause he doesn't have a wand," Ron said.

  "And so long as he doesn't steal one from someone incompetent, we'll all be safe." I glanced down the table at Longbottom. It would only be prudent to steal his wand before someone else did.

  "You should have at least told a teacher," Hermione muttered. She snatched back the paper, skimming it. "Two hundred spells?"

  I shrugged. "I could show you them, but most require a live target."

  She frowned deeper. "The Hat didn't consider putting you anywhere but Gryffindor? Alright, I know that one's a lie."

  "No it isn't," I said.

  "You were under for five minutes."

  "It wanted to talk to me. I'm very famous, you know," I said, raising my chin haughtily.

  "Mate, you're starting to sound like a Slytherin again," Ron advised.

  I lowered my chin and tried to look very Gryffindor by waving my arms around like an idiot. "Okay, fine, it didn't know where to put me because I so perfectly encapsulated the values of all four houses. I was very cunning, astoundingly brave, and the most intelligent person he'd ever sorted."

  Ron said, "You didn't mention loyalty."

  "Oh, right, he also thought that I would fit well in Hufflepuff since I would look even more impressive when surrounded by their bumbling. I refused that placement outright, of course."

  "I don't believe you," Hermione said. This is exactly the sort of honesty that makes Gryffindors so easy to manipulate. Their obsession with "feelings" and "relationships" were also helpful on that front.

  "You're my best friend, Hermione. Would I lie to my best friend?"

  She rolled her eyes, though an amused smile pulled at her lips, and Ron yelped, "I thought I was your best friend!"

  I ignored him. "Come to think of it, Skeeter did lie about one thing. She claimed that I cried over Lockhart. That's completely ludicrous, and I resent her attempts to sabotage my place in the tournament by making me seem weak."

  "Crying when someone dies doesn't make you weak," Hermione said, looking troubled. "It just makes you human."

  "Yes, and I think we've all established that I'm better than that," I said.

  Somehow, that led to another lecture on emotional neglect.

  It was too dark. Harry was desperate to look through his mother's trunk. He'd examined every inch when he was five. But barely glanced last year. Last year. Which was actually six years from now. This was confusing as all hell. And he was tired. And it was too dark. So he just ran his hand along the rim of the lid until his finger found the velvet pouch. He could feel the rings inside. He slipped the drawstring over his wrist and climbed into bed. He thought he'd never fall asleep, but next time he opened his eyes, sunlight streamed in the window by his bed.

The second is from a fic that disappeared from the web called The Lioness Prophecies by AMR, which I fortunately saved a copy of before it went away.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione and Harry both enjoyed the weeks that followed. Thomas took them for rides in the sleigh to the far reaches of the estate, and then long walks through the extensive woods. They also strolled down into Snape Parva and visited the church and the shops, and Hermione found an internet café where they could e-mail her parents and some of their friends. They also made a shopping trip with Professor Snape to Diagon Alley and nearby parts of Muggle London. Hermione and Harry enjoyed the latter excursion, as they negotiated for their Professor what was a strange world to him, showing him some of the bookshops and helping him make his purchases with Muggle money. Back in the wizarding world, they bought Christmas presents and looked at the magical holiday decorations while Professor Snape did errands for Dumbledore and his great-grandfather, and picked up some potion ingredients they needed.
