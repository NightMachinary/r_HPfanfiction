It's one of my favorite swear words. I'm just wondering if any fics have the characters making use of that word. Thanks

**** Such is the risk of using any English insult. They are all very closely if not directly related to sex.

****** Moron is less an insult and more a statement of fact. There is an actual definition that can qualify you as a moron, but there is not a definition for asshole, fucker, or bitch.

EDIT: Perhaps a better word would be "curse word" rather than insult.

Technically there is. Respectively, a certain part of the human anatomy, a human who engages in certain reproductive behaviors, and a female dog.

********* Perhaps not for fucker, but colloquially speaking both asshole and bitch are in fact used according to their proper definitions fairly frequently. Asshole more so than bitch, but if one views the term bitch from the sexual perspective which accounts for a not insignicant percentage of its usage. It is still somewhat related to the proper meaning as it refers to a direct parallel between the behaviour of a female dog when reproducing and the person being called bitch.

So while words like "fucker" might not be used much according to their literal definitions, most crass, vulgar, inappropriate, and or derogatory/insulting language is often used according to its proper definition as, rather than changing the definition, the greatest insult lies in using a word whose definition actually matches with some characteristic of the person in question.

For instance: calling someone who drinks a lot and tends to destroy things while drunk a retarded idiot is not nearly so insulting or damaging as calling them a violent destructive alcoholic waste of civilization's resources. People tend to pick up on this and use the most damage insult more often than not, and thus use the word that most literally and accurately fits the situation. Leading to a situation where the literal definition of the word is used far more often than any colloquial definition or synonym far more often than not.
