:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
i read it a while ago, it was a time travel fic where Harry escapes from a dystopian future where the muggles are hunting the wizards and experimenting on them and harry was caught and had a device inserted into his neck that made him mute to stop him from casting spells . so he started talkin with ribbons from his wand.

i remember him meeting with Voldemort and telling him his story and plan for their survival and being ambushed by the order of pheonix outside of Gringott and Dumbledore asking to meet him..

thanx for the help and i'll add anything else i remember :) :)


** I've read this. I know I have. I'll have a look through my bookmarks.

Edit: I feel like this is something I read on someone's yahoo rather than a fic site. Like. It was an author who I followed on ao3/fanfic. But they had a link to a load of unfinished stuff on yahoo groups. And this was one of them. I'm thinking maybe Athey as I know she had extra stuff on yahoo that I read a lot of. Unfortunately yahoo groups went taking all the files with it. So if this is the case then it may be lost unless someone has saved a copy from before they got closed down.
