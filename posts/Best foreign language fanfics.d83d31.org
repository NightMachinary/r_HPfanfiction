Are there any good ones that aren't translated? I never thought about it before.


** Japanese language fandom has a few great fics with a taste I don't normally see in the English one. (I haven't finished the two fics below, so the summaries are just a teaser based on my incomplete knowledge.)

/Dolohov/ is a story set in an era years before Harry's. Oscar Dolohov, 11 years old, son of Antonin Dolohov, has grown up under a constant monitoring by Aurors, with his parents prisoned in Azkaban, without a loving family for his entire life. He hasn't had much hope for things to improve when starting at Hogwarts, but an incredulously friendly girl named Est Prewett, whose parents were murdered by his father, begs to differ. Plot is well-structured and dialogues are witty - the author tries to imitate (the official Japanese translation of) JKR's style. I think that's fairly successful, although the characterization is undoubtedly affected by YA Japanese novels and manga. Main characters feel a bit overpowered and can fight using adult-level spells as 1st years (with reasons). Link: ドロホフ君とゆかいな仲間たち [[https://syosetu.org/novel/139995/]] (incomplete but updated)

/Houdini/ is a very Slytherin story of /Harry Potter/ in which Dolores Umbridge has a cunning administrative clerk named Vladimir Propp (the protagonist). The point of departure is when, after the resurrection of Voldemort, Lucius Malfoy decides to plant Propp (instead of Umbridge) as a teacher at Hogwarts. The tricky thing is, unknown to anyone else, Propp is barely magical - he is determined to survive by deceiving and manipulating both foes and friends. It looks like the story involves a lot of politics and the protagonist's inability of using magic brings interesting constraints. The first-person narration is not off-putting - it's actually a specialty of Japanese novels - and fits well with a character who does a lot of plotting behind the scene. The author is a manga artist and posts illustrations of his/her fics on Twitter. Link: フーディーニの魔法 [[https://syosetu.org/novel/147613/]] (complete)

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11820851/1/La-partida-del-Maestro-de-la-Muerte][*/"La partida del Maestro de la Muerte"/* or quickly translated */"The Departure of the Master of Death"/*]], is one that I do really want to see translated.

I don't speak spanish so was trying to read a machine translated version. What was there certainly drawed me in, before the translation gave me a headache...

Quick translation of the summary (mostly machine, but I did clean it a bit.)

#+begin_quote
  Harry takes advantage of the fact that he is the new Master of Death and gets a second chance for Hermione, who died during the Battle of Hogwarts. Now he just has to wait the necessary years to see her again and, hopefully, love her as he should have from the beginning. The only thing he didn't calculate was the age difference...
#+end_quote

Interesting things that were happening include; Hermione being picked by the elder wand, Harry's friends being suspicious about this new Hermione, and Hermione thinking that Harry is being cold to her because she shares the name of his "dead" friend.

** Harry Potter und die Schatten der Vergangenheit. German fanfic, can be found on fanfiction.de. Au after halfblood prince, starts with the defeat of Voldemort. It's epically long and while it's main theme is Hermione taking a potions apprenticeship under Snape and figuring out what the fuck is wrong with the dude and eventually getting into his pants, pretty much every character in Canon has a very well thought out story line that all interconnect beautifully.

Highlights are:

Harry's weird magical talents nobody really understands

Malfoy family story line, especially Lucius loosing his sight due to inbreeding

Sirius dealing with his metric fuckton of trauma and finding happiness

Snape being very in Character and his entire backstory

A dark lord that's actually a muggle

The first couple chapters are a bumpy ride, but it's easily one of best fanfics I've ever read.

** A long long time ago, I really enjoyed the German language Geheimnisse trilogy, dealing with a blind Muggle (or is he?) boy finding his way into Hogwarts. It was an adventure story with a similar vibe to early canon books, dealt entirely with OCs and took place during the second to fourth Harry Potter books.

However, towards the end, the author stopped updating regularly and updates only came a few times during the year and without any editting, so I slowly gave up on it. Just looked it up on his homepage though and apparently it's complete now. You can read it (including an English translation of the first two chapters) [[http://storyteller-homepage.de/Storys/Harry_Potter_Fanfic/harry_potter_fanfic.html][here]].

(NGL I really appreciate the old school page design as well...)

*** That's a nice fic. Somehowe, not only the page but the fic too feels old school in a good way. Too bad google translate somehow seems unable to translate the whole page. But perhaps I will try to read it in German to keep up my skills.
