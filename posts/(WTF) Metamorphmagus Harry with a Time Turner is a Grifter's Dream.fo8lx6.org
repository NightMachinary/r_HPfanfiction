:END:
I'm looking for a fic where Harry is a metamorphmagus and is somehow in possession of a time turner - he's playing about six different people and some of them are friends and hang out regularly and Hermione is Very Concerned^{TM} for his sanity since those people are all just him.

** Oh... been looking for metamorphmagus harry stories. I'll be sure to read it as soon as possible.

I think I once read something similar, but only 1 person in each of the Hogwarts houses... and they only rarely interacted with each other. He actually did everything he could to keep them apart. My memory might just be spotty af and it turns out to be the same story. Will probably enjoy it anyway. Thank you!
