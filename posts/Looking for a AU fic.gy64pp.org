:END:
So in this story Hermione gives Harry a mirror. When Harry looks into the mirror so does an alternate universe version of himself. Both Harry's looking in the mirror at the same time causes them to swap places. CanonHarry finds himself in a world where AUHarry is just a quidditch player and Neville is the boy who lived. Snape is like a store keeper or something. When CanonHarry finds himself in the new world the first thing he sees is Snape and not knowing whys going on harry blames snape. Harry attacks snape and breaks his nose and then uses legitemcy(not spelled right sorry) to search snapes mind to find out he is in a new world. Canon harry is forced to team up with new snape to fight voldemort and end the war behind the scenes before he can return to his correct universe. (I think in the new universe hermione and Ron might be dead but I'm not sure)..

Any help will be appreciated it's a great AU fic that I really want to find again.
