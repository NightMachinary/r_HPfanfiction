I need some cathartic material. Can be one shots or long fics. Maybe unrequited love or grieving or disappointment. Preferably no abuse fics or rape recovery. Harry centric would be great, but not necessary. Generally sad stuff.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/473335/chapters/819506][Twist of Fate]] is exactly what you need. It is a (sorta) canon-compliant Drarry where Harry and Draco have a young love relationship in secret during 4th and 5th year. Then because of the threat of Voldermort using Draco to get to Harry, Draco has to erase Harry's memories of their relationship. The fic picks back up during the Death Eater trials when Harry finds out about the relationship he lost. It is so heartbreakingly beautiful. Loved this fic - it is probably my favorite of all time.
