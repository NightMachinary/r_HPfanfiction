:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
After a total failure of my hard drive I lost many stories, I hope here in Reddit can help me at least to recover some of the ones I was reading.

I'm looking for a fanfic, where Harry finds a piece of kryptonite, and by having it he becomes telepathic, and here the teen titans come in, but instead of the normal formation, Raven and Starfire go with Harry.

I am also looking for a story, it is perhaps something for adults only so I will not put many details, one of Harry's teachers, according to me the rune one, because she totally becomes his pet, and even ends up giving up school for him. to continue being his pet, they start their relationship with a project and spend more time together, I don't remember if Harry had an official "girlfriend" but I remember that the teacher basically became his slave by choice.

I plan to add more stories that I look for but for now these are the 2 that I remember and I would appreciate your help to see if someone remembers them and can share the link

Greetings and thanks


** The one with the teacher is love of magic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11669575/36/For-Love-of-Magic]]

Just double checked as I doubted myself and it is a harem with the arithmancy teacher becoming a sorta personal assistant/submissive with a harem
