i got this idea, when i found some Art in the Net. Through this i thought that Harry has Harem (or lets say several females who love, like or admire him) and Harry treats any of them equal. He assures that the others pleasures are fulfilled and accomplished. But one female would like to be the submissive type, to be used by him. She is fine with the gentle and kind way of Harry, but her sexual fantasy would be a Dominate Harry, who use her for pleasure. No rape stuff. Maybe a bit OoC from Harry. Maybe a bit dirty talk, but i would mostly see harry dominating his lover with actions instead of words.

I already took a glimpse at "The Power of Seven" on Archiveofyourown and with this, i know that Demelza is a pretty submissive one.

​

Later in the Fic Harry meets fleurs mom, who tries to seduce him, but he rejects her. Too Bad i have to say. I mention this, because i would like her or a similar Fic with her involving (not a harem) being the same.


** "Testing Defenses" by canoncansodoff ([[https://canoncansodoff.fanficauthors.net/Testing_Defenses/index/]]). Not full bore harem, but light-hearted and several ladies have an interest in teaching Harry. One likes to be spanked (shan't ruin the surprise).

*** Also, “Testing Defenses by canoncansodoff” linkffn(3958679). And one of them is a Domina amateur (doing her whip work with one hand and “Idiot Guide to being a Dominatrix” in other). ;)

**** I believe they are slightly different; at the time they were posted, ff.net was stricter about sexual content (or was changing their policies), so a number of authors posted racier versions on other sites.
