I'm sure that in all of the hundreds of thousands of Harry Potter fanfiction's that this is not unique but I wonder if the ideal that Harry intentionally enters Voldemort into the tri-Wizard tournament as a way to strip him of his magic so that whenever he meets Voldemort during the ritual Baltimore unwillingly strips his own magic away from himself by not competing in the tournament


** I've seen the idea but can't think of any specific fics that use it off the top of my head.

More importantly The Dark Lord Baltimore is the greatest autocorrect of Voldemort I have ever seen.
