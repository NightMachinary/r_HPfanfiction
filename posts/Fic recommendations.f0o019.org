Looking for a fic that involves Sirius running away and then living with the potters. Doesn't have to have the actual running away bit but that's preferred. A lot of stuff I've read has just been the running away and I would like to see a bit of the weeks after he started living there! Don't know if this has been made because I've been searching haha xx

  It's the summer after fifth year, and Sirius has made himself scarce as usual. But then Remus catches a glimpse of him in Witch Weekly's special on the Black-Malfoy wedding. Something about that photo is very, very off... Turns out this is the summer Sirius runs away. Or tries to. Because the Blacks are not giving up on their heir without a fight.
