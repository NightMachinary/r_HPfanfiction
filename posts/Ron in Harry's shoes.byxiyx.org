I'm sure that most of us will have stumbled into at least one scene in a fic where Ron starts whining about how Harry gets everything and how he gets nothing..

Has anyone ever done a story where Ron gets to walk a mile in Harry's shoes.. e.g. A full vault and every single Weasley aside from himself buried in the family plot?

Not quite what you're asking for, but hopefully close enough?

  On the train platform, Harry suffered a hug from Remus, a hair ruffle from Sirius, and a "don't do anything I wouldn't do" from his mother, and then he ran for the brick wall, cart rattling before him. The snowy owl they'd gotten him hooted softly in protest. Harry had named her Ororo after the Muggle comic books his mother had introduced him to. Lily took Harry to the comic store every time he sat through a whole visit with his aunt, uncle, and cousin and didn't kick anybody unless they kicked him first. Bill tried to wipe some dirt off a dodging Ron's nose. Ginny complained loudly about being left behind. Fred and George ran off to see Lee Jordan's spider. People watched the Weasleys from all directions--they were hard to miss--and Ron's shoulders slowly rose up and up to his reddening ears. He missed the big empty orchards behind the Burrow already. Ron was one of the last people on the train. He slid past staring eyes and finally stepped himself into an almost unoccupied compartment-- there was just one small boy tucked in there. He had messy dark hair, slightly askew round glasses, and a comic book held up in front of his nose. "Is it okay if I sit here?" said Ron. "Everywhere else is full."

** Well, there's the infamous /Champion's Champion/, where Harry has Idiot!Ron compete in the Triwizard Tournament in his stead, but I'm no fan of Ron bashing, so I couldn't stand it. linkffn(5483280)

As for the more comprehensive Ron in Harry's life, I can't say I've ever seen that take; the closest I've seen is Enlightened!Harry telling Ron to imagine a life where that's the case, which fixes Ron's jealousy immediately.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

** somebody write one of those time travel fics where harry ends up in someone else's body on accident and has to pretend to live their life and still change the past, BUT MAKE IT FUCKING RON TIME TRAVELING BACK AND GETTING STUCK IN HARRYS BODY INSTEAD! so he has to literally walk in his shoes.

and if it isnt a stupid ass bashing fic, maybe play up the tragedy like, ron goes back because harry died and he wanted to save his best friend, but he ended up in his damn body so its now impossible to even save harry in the past...all he can do is press on and save the lives of those around him /FOR HARRY./ kind of do an eren and armin friendship from attack on titan.
