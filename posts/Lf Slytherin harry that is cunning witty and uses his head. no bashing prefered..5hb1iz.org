** Hogwarts: Battle School by Kwan. It's 50 chapters in, but he hasn't updated in months. Not sure if he's abandoned, but I hope not. One of my favorite stories.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  An ongoing series of one shot stories exploring how Slytherin!Harry would have handled key moments from the books. Events will appear out of order, so don't be surprised if it jumps around. Small but important edit made to Chapter Five

*** While this story is a lot better than the title would suggest it does involve a lot of cliches and heavy Dumbledore bashing. It's actually a classic wrong-BWL story with all the usual tropes, the difference is that it's actually well written and has some intriguing ideas.

If you dislike tropes this story won't be to your liking but if you don't have a problems with well executed tropes it quite enjoyable.

**** Also good example of time travel done well. I would say it is better then many WBWL stories as John Potter is not a complete waste of space as he has skills and power of his own see Prince of Slytherin for another good example of this in action. As far as Bashing goes compared to cannon sure he is bashed but in this alternative universe the author created Dumbledore is making reasonable moves he moves too slowly however as he discovers just how far behind the curve he is though.

***** I guess it depends on what you consider bashing. Dumbledore is not the "Lul Dumbles" idiot that the worst fics make him out to be, he is in fact a lot more competent than most Dumbledore's i've read about but that doesn't change the fact that he's mind bogglingly "for the greater good" evil.

That sort of bashing annoys a lot of people. It's similar to love potion Molly or retard jealous Ron and i thought it would be a good idea to point it out.

** The King Indian Attack on FFN and AO3 is still only in first year, but I really love it. It has Slytherin!Sinistra and Snape manipulating things in the background, ending up with Harry and Hermione in Slytherin, and the latest chapter actually pointed out that sending the Slytherins to the dungeon where the troll was, is STUPID.
