Please my guys yall gotta come thruuu

Edit: don't really like fem!Harry and hogwarts years preferred :p


** 1)I think “His Twenty-Eighth Life” by Lomonaaeren fits the bill for what you want. It's 69 chapters and despite hating long stories this was not tedious or dragged out in the least bit. Harry is the Master of Death in this story and keeps on being born again in slightly altered universes. He is powerful and is paired with Voldemort.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11682105/chapters/26295858]]

2)Had I known by kayly silverstorm has elements of powerful Harry, the abuse and trauma he had to come to terms with after the war, and a development of a strong bond with Snape. While it might not be Severitus the bond they get to develop in 50 chapters is truly worth reading in my opinion.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2544950/1/Had-I-Known]]

3)To kill you with a kiss by Paimpont is a beautiful Tomarry story were Harry accidentally time travels back to Tom's time. Unlike most Tomarry fanfics this isn't angsty and Harry isn't dark and brooding.The writing is flowery and bittersweet. It's 29 chapters and well worth your read.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6655266/1/To-Kill-You-With-A-Kiss]]

4) Consuming shadows by Child_OTKW is an alternate universe Harrymort fanfic. And although Harry is extremely capable smart and powerful he never looses himself and what he stands for not even for the dark lord. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7040089/chapters/16011331]]

5) Vocare Prabia by Amber Evans Potter is a very well written dimension travel story. Harry has ptsd and is very powerful plus his best friends have traveled with him to support him every step of the way.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1542080/1/Vocare-Prabia]]

6) On a Pale Horse by Hyliian is a very well written master of death Harry potter fanfiction its only 25 chapters though so I don't know if its long enough for you. It includes dimension traveling.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10685852/1/On-a-Pale-Horse]]

7)October by the Carnivorous Muffin is a Master of death Harry-Potter fanfic it's well written and has probably one of the best depictions of the MOD trope the pairing is both Harry/Tom and Tom/Lily its not a threesome though. Also would recommend her other story Lily and the art of being Sisyphus It's a fem Harry but It nearly fits all your requirements up above and I truly urge you to give it a try. I'll put both of the links below.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10311215/1/October]]

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus]]

8) Teaching History (is Old News) by You Light The Sky it's a Tomarry fic which is cute but also very insightful and interesting. In which Tom is the DADA professor at Hogwarts, secretly recruiting followers for his future army, and Harry is the worst Divination professor ever, accidentally messing up Tom's plans.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11973276/1/Teaching-History-is-Old-News]]

9) Make A Wish by Rorschach's Blot its a smart Harry for sure but very lighthearted and fun!

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish]]

10) An Aunt's Love by Emma Lipardi is a story were A strong Harry learns how to deal with the abuse and trauma of being the bwl it's long and well written.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2196609/1/An-Aunt-s-Love]]

Jonquils and Lightning by Lomonaaeren is a dimension traveling powerful Harry potter fanfic.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14178429/chapters/32682234]]

I hope this is enough for you and that you'll find something you might enjoy.

My last recommendation which I didn't include in the list is What He Grows To Be by Severus_divides_into_H it's an amazing Master of death fic with Harry raising Tom. Although Harry isn't dark Tom definitely is and it's beautifully written. It's actually one of my favorite fics of all time. I hope you give it a chance.

*** Thanks! I will definitely give most of these a read! I love lomonaaeren (had a hard time writing that) fics and for some reason I started reading his 28 lives but never finished?? Also I just finished to kill you with a kiss and SJKSKSKEEM lol Thanks again sooo much for the recommendations, and I hope you're staying safe ;p

***** The relationship is not the forefront of the story and its not that heavy but definitely its an interesting pairing. I don't want to spoil much but I feel like Tom loves Harry so much that it also influences his love for Lily. But the love is definitely genuine for the both of them. Definitely not an OTP for me but still it's so well written that I like it. Though I might be biased here because my favorite pairing will always be Tom and Harry. I know the Tom/Lily part may deter you but it fits really seamlessly in the story so please don't let that stop you from trying the story because the characterization of Harry as MOD in the story is the best depiction I've read hands down. Plus Tom and Lily's relationship aspect doesn't come up for a long time in the story.

Also sorry for rambling but if you have time please try Lily and the art of sisyphus too. I usually despise Fem Harry writings but this is so unique that it's really really worth reading. I guarantee you that it's nothing like you've ever tried with Lovecraftian, absurd, but also poignant and poetic elements.

****** Oh okay! Thanks for telling me that and I will definitely give both October and the art of sisyphus a try! I've seen both of them hovering around (isn't lily a pokemon trainer in the art of sisyphus?? Idk my brain is weird) and now I've got clarification I'll definitely try them!

I've also just finished into the pale and oh my god aaah it was hands down adorable. A shame it wasn't finished :(

******* You're actually not wrong about that. The author made a lot of spinoff crossovers with Lily and the art of sisyphus including naruto and pokemon but Lily and the art of sisyphus itself is purely about the master of death and what it might entail. It draws a lot of influence from authors like Philip.K.Dick and Camus. Also it really is a shame that on a pale horse wasn't updated I really liked that story too. Thank you btw for being open minded and commenting back I really appreciated that. (:

** My all-time favorite Drarry. Will read it a million times. Harry gets a chance to live a few weeks of the alternate life he would have had if he'd tried to befriend Draco back at Hogwarts. Starts as the Potters are on their way to the train station, as in the canon epilogue--and then things change drastically. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879852]])

I love everything Saras_Girl writes.

  AU: Voldemort had no idea what she was starting when she attacked the Potters on Halloween night. Not only did she create a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she unknowingly touched the life of another just as deeply. Harry Potter grew up anonymous and alone, and when he reached Hogwarts, he was not quite what everyone would have expected. WBWL, Fem!Voldemort.

Great fic, very long (whole series is 3 million + words iirc), fits several of what you're looking for (Drarry, abused!Harry, powerful!Harry, WBWL). I don't even usually like most of those categories, but this fic is really well written.

** The Fallout.

300k+ word deep dive into what war is and how people cope with it. Dramoine, which I usually don't like, but this isn't really a romance. It's a tale of Hermione and Draco trying to survive a particularly brutal wizarding war and everything that comes with it. Author really uses Rowling's magic system in a way that we've always wanted. COMPLETE!!! i loved it so much I saved it as an ePub, and I NEVER do that. I really cannot recommend it enough.

I'm on mobile, so I'll go ahead and copy the link here and then reply with anything else I see in my bookmarks. Are you in to ASOIAF? Most of my saved fics are in that fandom.
