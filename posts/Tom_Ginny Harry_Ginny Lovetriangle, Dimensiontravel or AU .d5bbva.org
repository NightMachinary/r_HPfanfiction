I would like to know Fics that have Harry and Ginny are travelling by any cause to an other Dimension and there they meet a Good Tom Riddle. While it turns out that he is a Key figure for why they are there, Tom (immediately) gets attracted and falls for Ginny. Ginny however, due to her evil Memories of him as the diary, might be very skeptical to Toms approaches or reluctant in accepting him as a Good Person. Over time her Behavior towards him changes and possibly her old Crush feelings for him come up. She is torn between Tom and Harry.

/Optional: to make things worse, it turns out, that Tom is sleeping with a Couple of Woman, but only because he isnt married./

So the Fic can be Canon H/G (married/dating or not) travel to an good Tom. Or it can be a complete AU from the beginning with Tom, Harry and Ginny being the same age or going in different classes/grades....or even post-Hogwarts.

Now that i think about it, it can also be Ginny alone who goes to meet with Good Tom and skeptical/reluctant at the beginning, she begins to warm up for him. Maybe she and Harry arent together in that one or he is wating for her return, but i leave this to the Fic.
