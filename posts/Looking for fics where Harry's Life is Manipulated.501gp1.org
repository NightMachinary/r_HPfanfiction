Looking for fics where somebody or a group of people, preferably Dumbledore and his stooges, manipulate Harry, and then he figures it all out and frees himself.

TL;DR - looking for manipulative Dumbledore and Co.

***** I AM LORD HARRY JAMES POTTER, I DEFEATED THE FUCKING DARK LORD VOLDEMORT AND NOW I AM HERE TO SEND YOUR ASS OFF TO THE NEXT LIFE AND INTO HELL!

I've read a few stories where it's said that a dead member of Harry's family, usually Lily or Dorea, does a nice one on Dumbledore in the afterlife. Not limited to castration, harassment, or other forms of torture and bullying.

***** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Origin War). Sadly abandoned. It's not a top tier fic, but I enjoy it greatly.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well-Groomed Mind]] is probably the best if these. It's got a competent Dumbledore and pulls it off really surprisingly well.

** linkffn(When Harry Met Wednesday)

First let me say I hate the trope you described, this fic however uses it incredibly well. Its a crossover but you don't really need to know the Addams.

  Sirius is dead, and Harry has reached his breaking point. A chance meeting with a pale girl and her family moves Harry's life in a new direction. Rated M for macabre themes, and later on suggestive adult content.
