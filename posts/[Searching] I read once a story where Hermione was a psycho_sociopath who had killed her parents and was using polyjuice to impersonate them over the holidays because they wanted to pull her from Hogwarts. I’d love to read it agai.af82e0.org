*** I'm not sure. I remember them having been killed and her using it to be them for several years to do things. I assume the author ignored that part of the potion process. I've read other stories that have done that as well.

**** It's possible Moody had a contingency for him dying undiscovered, and something or someone would be alerted upon his death. Given a lot of things seem to be self-updating, like the Hogwarts book, I imagine Crouch couldn't risk someone realizing the real Moody had died.

**** I actually took the time to research this based on wanting to use polyjuice of someone's youth when they got older so that they didn't have to deal with infirmities of the body. The average Human head has 100,000 hairs on it. With one full harvesting of hair you would have enough hairs to supply you with 11.7 years worth of constant polyjuice fuel. As you can add other things, this leads to more possibilities, but she could hopefully fake their deaths by then.

*** Well in the books Harry and co just took some hair and used it. It never said how much was needed to make the potion work. So with two people and maybe like half a strand of hair for each potion it could work for years.
