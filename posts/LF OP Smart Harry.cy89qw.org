Looking for some smart and op harry. I just finished reading runic animagi and it has me looking for more. Some things to note

No slash

60k+

30k+ if complete or still actively updating

I don't care what pairing

Not looking for a harry that is related to Merlin and has all the power in the world, I want a harry that is smart and uses the power he has to it's greatest effect.

Edit- sorry this post was done on mobile

** Pretty much anything by Sinyk, though you'll have to deal with a LOT of Weasley and Dumble-bashing. I generally dislike his work, but the writing isn't terrible.

I also didn't mind linkffn(9750991)

*** Yeah Sinyk's writing itself is pretty easy to read. But the angsty, arrogant, and straight up dickhead Harry + the bashing kinda ruins it for me. He also made like the exact same fic 3 different times.

**** That's why I said I only didn't mind Angry Harry - it was the first one I read, so it was new, while the rest were not

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.
