Posting this again because not being able to find the story is driving me nuts.

Ok so there's this HP fanfic that I love, but I can't find it anywhere. It's basically Harry gets wrongly convicted and sent to Azkaban with only the Weasley twins believing in him the entire time. Barry's innocence is proven and when he gets out of azkaban he's not in his right mind and the Weasley twins are the ones that are there to help him. Eventually Harry gets his sanity back and Dumbledore now begins to press Harry to fight Voldemort because he's the boy who lives but Harry doesn't want to seeing as the Wizarding world was against him for years.

That's the basic plot with a lot of the Twins caring about Harry. PLEASE if someone can find this fanfic and send me the link I'd be enternally grateful!

  COMPLETE! Harry Potter has spent six years in Azkaban. Now, Dumbledore, Black and Lupin are here to retrieve him, now certain of his innocence. Will they be too late to save Harry's sanity? And if so, what does this mean for the world? AU after year 4.

** Is this the one where Fabian and Gideon are still alive, and have children of their own in Hogwarts? If so, I'm in the exact same boat as you - haven't been able to find it for months! Think it might've been removed off ff.net, since it disappeared off my favourites list.
