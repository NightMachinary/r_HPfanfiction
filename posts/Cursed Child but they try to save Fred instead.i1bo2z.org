Albus and Scorpious try to save Fred. Maybe they try to lead him to another corridor? Maybe they try to shield him from the explosion?

Bonus: In one of the alternate timelines, Percy dies instead. How does that change the plot?

*** Or about 14 yr olds incapacitating Fred before he can actually leave for the battle. Maybe they do something which is very embarrassing in front of a lot of people at Diagon Alley. Hence his future turn +to the Dark Side+ into Death Eater.
