Doesn't have to be a *first* year spell necessarily, just something benign but turns out there's a very deadly use case scenario that no one thought of till now.

*** That makes no sense whatsoever, although the image is amusing.

â€‹

Alohomora is the unlocking charm, but atoms aren't locked or bonded towards each other. The strong force is an attractive force which holds the atom together and acts on short scales, so we would need a charm to stretch the different nucleons from each other. So something like an overpowered expansion charm.

  Harry Potter is a geek, a nerd, a total dork whose favorite hobby is "transfiguring stuff." He doesn't understand what rules are, has no social skills, is barely sentient, and is very smart.

** "Now Harry please explain to me what you did to Quirrell again?" Dumbledore asked Harry in a tired voice having been up for 36 hours at this point dealing with the fall out of this had clearly left him worn out.

"Well Headmaster when I got to the room with the mirror I saw Professor Quirrell and when I realized that there was no way I would have a spell that I could hit him with and stop him I chose to use the Lumos charm in the hopes of blinding him."

"Ah I see that makes sense then. As I will be announcing this at Breakfast tomorrow morning I feel there is no harm in telling you now that due to the permanent and irreversible damage done by your Lumos with regards to the now former Professor Quirrell that short of a miracle he will never see again the Ministry has decided to classify the Lumos spell as an unforgivable curse. But in any case I believe I should leave you to enjoy your sweets." Albus smiled down at Harry and then turned to leave the Hospital Wing.

*** I would love to see combat applications of spells like obliviate. Like in between casting curses, you hit them with an obliviate (which doesn't seem to have a projectile, if I remember right) and during the post-obliviate confusion, you hit them with something else.

Similarly using silent casting to accio/banish the enemy's ankle to cause them to lose balance and be unable to dodge.

Since gamma rays, X-rays and microwaves are also light the possibilities with Lumos range from accidentally cooking someone to turning Hogwarts and Hogsmead into another Pripyat.
