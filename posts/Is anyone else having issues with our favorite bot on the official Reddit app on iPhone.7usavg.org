None of the links work properly for me, I have to basically google the story name or try and copy/paste the # into fanfiction.net and that's a pain on the iPhone.

Love the sub and bot otherwise!!!


** Yeah, for at least 1 or 2 months. There's no link, it's just a bunch of gibberish.

*** It's been the case for a lot longer. Honestly, I can't remember it ever working properly since the official Reddit iOS app came out.

** Yes, I have the same problem. I have to open reddit in safari if I want to click on a ffbot link.
