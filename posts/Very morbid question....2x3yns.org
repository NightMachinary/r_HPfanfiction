There are tons of incomplete fanfics out there, and usually you end up clicking on the author's profile and being either annoyed that they've been writing Glee fanfic for the past four years, or annoyed that they just haven't done anything since 2011.

And occasionally I kind of wonder if any of the authors i've read are...well...dead. Have there been any stories where a popular author died or something?


** Whenever I get frustrated that a great fic is incomplete and clearly abandoned, I always feel bad immediately after this thought because I wonder if the author is seriously ill or dead :(

*** This doesn't seem very sensible. Most abandonments are not caused by death, in my experience (I follow a lot of authors post-abandonment to see if they hint at any possibilities of returning)

**** Yeah definitely. Haha I know it's not logical, I just always say "what if" and make myself feel bad. Even if it's not something as bad as death or illness, life still gets in the way of doing things we enjoy, man.

** While I believe he's still alive (he posted not long ago to a forum I haunt), [[http://fp.fanficauthors.net/about/][Full Pensieve]] of /Harry Potter and the Years of Rebellion/ fame (one of the earliest and most influential "Indy!Harry" stories extant) has a medical condition for which he's far outlived projections of his life expectancy. A pity, as he's a classy, gracious guy (as well as a very good writer).

In response to a "peanut gallery" PM, let me clarify: the 'pity' is that he is suffering from the medical condition, not that he's somehow managed to outlive said condition's morbidity predictions.

** There was someone who was big in the slash community, Switchknife. One day Switchknife wrote something on LJ that they would be leaving fandom and wouldn't say why. Then reappeared later, only to leave again. I had assumed it was due to health issues, and figured Switchknife died after a while of nothing on their lj. But there's an article on [[http://fanlore.org/wiki/Switchknife][Fanlore]] that says maybe Switchknife came back under a different name, so who knows.

I tend to not even read WIPs since I don't want to deal with the possibility of them abandoning the fic/fandom, or anything more serious like illness or death. :/

** There was some Twilight author that faked her death via drunk driving accident and had a "twin sister" that was trying to finish a few of her fics. Drama, drama, drama.

It was Daddy's Little Cannibal. She has [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1542023/][two]] ff.net [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1600981/NathaliePUribe][profiles]] now. Her "twin sister" put up a eulogy and then the author returned and posted some monologue about how she was 20 now and living her life as an adult and a real author.

** Trisha Masen aka Simon's_Flower passed away in August 2009 (edit: due to an extended illness, that no one thought would be life-threatening). She cofounded The Quidditch Pitch and still is one of the best authors on that site, and arguably the single best Ménage à Trio author. There was a memorial fund raiser/smut writing competition the next month on what would have been her 38th birthday =(

** The only verifiable instance of this that I recall is the loss of PerfesserN.

While he wasn't insanely popular, his works were appreciated for their humor and eroticism. There is an audio/podcast of one of his works ['The Afterlife and Times of Myrtle Potter'] floating around the web, and his works are still available on multiple host sites.

** In the HP fandom, I'm not sure. I have experienced this once though. Pretty much the only other fandom I'm into is Mass Effect, and there was this author who penned down some of my favorite stuff who died in a car accident (I think) back in 2012. Her [[http://celticknotgirl.deviantart.com/][page]] is still up and serves as a bit of a memorial now.

Within it, she explains in her author's notes about a slew of health issues and how they aren't allowing her to regularly update (despite it being well over 300k words in about 9 months). Struggle with cancer and complications and such. The story then took a one month break, had another chapter (in which the A/N mentioned a medical complication) and nothing since.

Other authors (like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/275530/FonzFan][FonzFan]]) have mentioned that she passed away.

I hadn't talked to her in a while, and left a message on her deviantart page, only to get a response a week or two later from her sister saying that she had died in a traffic accident about a month prior.

*** I'm sure a lot of that is authors getting bored of writing or not having time. A good way to see this is looking at when their most recent fav was published. An example is Nonjon who wrote a bunch from like 2005 or 2006 until 2009, then didn't publish again for almost two years, then nothing. However, he fav'd a story published in 2013, so he's probably not dead or completely gone from ffnet.
