I've been reading too much ron bashing recently anything you guys have is appreciated


** Most of these are oneshots,but:

1. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9191315/chapters/20857637][tell me whether he is dead]]: “Harry suffers a few side-effects of dying but not dying.” Fluff with light angst. Has a great trio portrayal, and is pretty sweet. (Can be read as gen or Harry/Hermione/Ron, Shortfic) linkao3(9191315)
2. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15275916][there will come a time, you'll see]]: “A curse regresses Harry to his seventeen year old self, physically and mentally. He doesn't recognise this strange peaceful wizarding world, but there are two people he does recognise: Ron and Hermione.”

A great trio friendship oneshot I loved.(Gen, Oneshot) linkao3(15275916)

1. for as long as you need us: A post-war fic where Harry turns to his two best friends to help him survive the losses of the war. A great fic, with a heartbreaking plot twist. (Harry/Hermione/Ron, Oneshot) linkao3(16957743)

4.A Clean Shave: “In which Harry's being an orphan has an unexpected side-effect, and Ron helps him out---learning a lesson in gratitude along the way.”

A great Ron-Harry friendship oneshot.(Gen,Oneshot) linkffn(13106128)

Edit: Added the link for the first two fics as the bot doesn't seem to be working.

  “It's always been the three of us, Harry,” Hermione assured him, her arms wrapped tightly around his middle as he sobbed into her shoulder.“We've dealt with enough strange things mate,” Ron whispered in his ear, his chest pressed against Harry's back and his arms holding him tight. “Let this be a good thing.”With the wizarding world thrown into grief by the end of the war, Harry turns to his best friends to help him survive the terrible losses.

  HPHGRW. In a conversation with Dumbledore's portrait, Harry finds out that he is and always has been a homunculus---a substitute body made to carry the Horcrux so that little Harry Potter, who lies asleep as a baby under powerful charms, wouldn't have to. Harry struggles to process the news, the fallout, and the discovery that he might disintegrate at any moment. Threeshot. COMPLETE.

** I haven't read it myself but I often see linkffn(The Sum of Their Parts) recommended.

Also, if you don't mind poly Golden Trio, I really liked linkao3(22442983)

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
