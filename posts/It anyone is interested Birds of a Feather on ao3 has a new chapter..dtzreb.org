It's an AU fic in which Tom Riddle and Hermione are born in the same generation. They become friends before they get their Hogwarts letters. The fic has overall excellent quality of grammar, dialogue, pacing, character development, etc. The fic stands out from other HG/TMR fics because it avoids all of the typical Slytherin glorifying tropes and doesn't focus on romance. It's also one of the best written 1930s-40s period pieces that I've seen in this fandom.

  typical Slytherin glorifying tropes
#+end_quote

Are these the tropes where Slytherins are portrayed as a whole as elegant, beautiful, and impossibly refined? Like, the whole house is the cast list of a TV high school drama (Gossip Girl, Riverdale)?

I disagree with some aspects of how JKR wrote Slytherin, but at least she wrote them like actual people, and not fantasy Fair Folk elves. Marcus Flint has crooked teeth and failed a school year, Pansy is petty, Draco is a schoolyard bully and attention whore. Slytherin wish fulfillment in fanfic sometimes goes so hard that not only is the protagonist turned into one-dimensional cardboard, but every single side character is too.

***** Yes, some authors take the "Slytherins are just misunderstood" trope to the extreme such that the Slytherin characters don't get any flaws (except ones that make them edgy and therefore 'cool'). Some authors seem to think that a sympathetic portrayal requires taking away all of the serious negatives from one faction and redistributing them across the board to the others. I prefer the more balanced stories that show teenagers with realistic character strengths and faults (minus the high school drama tropes, because I loathe those).

  In 1935, Hermione Granger meets a boy in an orphanage who despises fairy stories, liars, and mediocrity. He offers her a deal of mutual convenience, and soon a tentative friendship forms between them---if Tom would ever lower himself to call anyone a "friend".But whatever they have, it's something special, and if there's anyone who can appreciate Specialness, it's Tom Riddle.1930's-40's Childhood Friends AU.

*** Probably this one: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15996890/chapters/37322936]]

It is a well-written fic about Hermione being born in Voldemort's era and them becoming friends.

Haven't read the later parts(hardly the only fic I stopped reading halfway through), but it was pretty good based on what I remember, though not the best HP fanfic with Hermione in that era(though the best one included time travel, so that's a bit different)
