** The majority of FF writers (notice I said writers, not good ones, and not prolific, etc) are girls and young women.

The majority of girls who want to pair Harry with Draco don't want to change the Bad Boy that is Draco. Occasionally they'll put him in leather pants (see: tvtropes page) but that's about it. Girls (read:immature females) want to write about how a bad boy can change if the right girl comes along. It's been a common writing tool for millennia.

Also consider. The vast majority of slash is written by female writers. Therefore, Harry gets feminized, as the women like the male character (or Alan Rickman) with whom they're pairing Harry. FemSnape simply wouldn't work, to say nothing of being somewhat disturbing.

Most male writers tend to pair Harry with a fantasy (OC standin such as Susan Bones, Daphne Greengrass), a multi pairing, Emma Watson (Perfect Hermione TM) or with a completely illogical older woman like Fleur or Tonks.

Now I have a plotbunny.. FemSnape who crushed on James Potter and couldn't stand Lily. Hmm...

*** DEAR LORD WHY, you have thoroughly traumatised me with the last statement. Though I think it'd be one of those 'love it cause it hurts thing' i would read it just to die a little inside. And I would review humorously and we would become best friends until I drove you crazy and you ended up bashing my brains in with a wand. And then I'd be sad.

I don't know how we got there.

To play devil's advocate here, it is certainly not impossible for Harry to end up with either of them. I mean, the French President married his High School teacher, and the age difference to Fleur (3 years) or Tonks (6 1/2 years) isn't that big in comparison. Hell, my parents are 18 years apart.

**** It's less creepy the older you get.

If a 25 year old is dating a 43 year old, that's their business. If a 32 year old is dating a 14 year old, however, that's creepy and probably illegal.

Even a 6 1/2 year age difference is far too big if one of the participants is <18.

Basically, if the pairing starts while Harry is in Hogwarts both Fleur and Tonks are probably too old for him. Post-Hogwarts is a different matter entirely.

****** I'm aware of the age of consent in my country. That doesn't make a 20 year old (Fleur is closer to four years older than Harry) or a 22 1/2 year old sleeping with a sixteen year old any less creepy.

It's not the horny teenager I'm side-eying. It's the grown adult sleeping with the horny teenager.

You want a creepy fact. Teen pregnancies are predominantly fathered by adult men aged 20+. If the mother is under 15, it is *six times* more likely the father will be over 20.

***** You're also talking about wizarding culture, though, which is a couple centuries behind it feels like. A 15 year old with a 21 year old in, say, 1840 wouldn't be all that surprising. /Harry/ should have a problem with it since he was brought up where that's weird and socially wrong, but anyone who grew up isolated in the wizarding world probably wouldn't have a problem with it.

** I think it's how they view that character honestly. Let's take Snape and Lupin for example. I think we'd all see Snape as the Dominant person in that relationship wouldn't you? Or Lucius Malfoy and Fudge, Lucius would be the dominant one. The more domineering, commanding, "Stronger" characters will always come off as more 'manly' and more of the 'dominant' ones in the relationship, than say Harry, or Ron, etc who will be viewed as more soft/warm/emotional etc than their counterparts, so will be viewed as weaker and therefore the female equivalent in that relationship. Which than makes it easier to go from that to making Harry/Ron/Whoever it may be into a female.

I honestly think it's just pyschological. Take Slash Smut for example, could you see Snape being a bottom? or Voldemort?

*** I see Snape in the abusive role in the relationship, you know, the one that warrants a prison sentence. He is a ruthless, obsessive person who couldn't get over a married woman who died long ago and whose death warrant he signed. He tried to manipulate Harry's opinion of his father, made a child's life hell due to a rivalry with said child's father despite the fact that Harry, thanks to Snape and Pettigrew, never got to know his father.

The only relationship I want to see him in involves dementors.

However, if Pettigrew hadn't betrayed them, none of them would ever have died, or at least not so soon and unexpectedly. All Pettigrew had to do, really, would have been to refuse to be secret keeper.

James was a bully and Snape was his victim, there's no way around that. Of course Snape should not have let that influence his behaviour towards Harry, being a professor and all, but telling Harry what a git his father was never seemed like an attempt at manipulation to me, and it certainly never made Harry doubt his father. Only when he saw Snape's memories in the Pensieve did he even consider that his father could have flaws.

I'm quite sure that even with Snape as his professor, Harry's life at Hogwarts was nothing like hell. It was a lot better than with the Dursleys and all the really bad parts (like Volde trying to kill him etc) didn't have anything to do with Snape.
