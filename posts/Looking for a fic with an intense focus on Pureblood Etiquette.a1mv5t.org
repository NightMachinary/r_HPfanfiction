I'd prefer it to be long and have some sort of pairing, but other than that I'm not too picky.

  Gen. Harry has reached a very bitter thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the pure-blood bigotry. Then he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear down the system and salt the earth.

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

** Many fics by Ellory/Ellroche on ff.net have this theme, and I believe they (or slight variants) can also be found on A03 by searching 'Pureblood Culture' or similar.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

** Linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) and its sequels have a generally favorable view of Pureblood Etiquette that feels very Jane Austin-esque. No real pairing yet, but plenty of story to sink your teeth into.

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.

** Ellory, Eli Roche, and Lomonaaren all have those types of stories. If you click on House of Black, sometimes those have pureblood stories, too. If you search Hufflepuff Harry on A03, there's a good story where Draco teaches him the ropes of pureblood society.

Extrnuary Muse, can't remember the exact spelling, also does some pureblood stories but goes overboard on some one shots to the point that it feels like a way of expressing their racism by using a fictional world as an outlet. For example, the author focuses on 'ivory' skin of the purebloods, etc., which is disturbing, or a perfectly normal, well behaved, intelligent muggleborn Lily is seen to be 'dirty' and 'impure' and ruining Sirius---that's a story with a female James.

** Pureblood culture and etiquette play an important role in my AU story "Patron", but neither are portrayed as entirely positive things - there are good and bad parts of both etiquette and culture in the story. It also covers the differences between pureblood culture in Britain, France and Bulgaria. It's not a story where Harry and Hermione happily accept the status quo. (Not helped by the fact that, since they learn the ins and outs mostly from books, not from family (who'd have told them that things are generally more relaxed in practise), they end up acting rather more conservatively than the rest of their year.)

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
