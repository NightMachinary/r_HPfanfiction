How often do you send your work to your alpha/beta readers? Is it chapter by chapter? Or do you wait until it is all finished and give it to them in one big chunk? Also, how do you treat revising? Do you treat fanfic like you're writing your own novel and go through multiple drafts, edits, etc... or do you write it once and be done with it?

Edit: Thank you for all the answers! It's helping me a lot and it's good to know what other people do so I can try it for myself!


** I'm fairly new to fanfic writing, but have written quite a bit (200k story, completed and a few in progress that will be way longer than that.)

I send my work chapter by chapter to my beta readers, (I usually try to have two per story) and ask for their input as well as their assistance in editing for grammar, spelling etc.

I usually try to write as much of a chapter at a time as possible, as I find once I am in a flow I write much better.

As for drafts... it depends. Usually I will write the chapter and edit it for grammar and such before leaving it for a few days. When I come back, I will revise and change anything I'd like.

If I really don't like the way a chapter looks, I'll scrap it and start new. I usually do it one take, but two drafts isn't uncommon; I did go through six drafts before settling on a finished progress once though, it was the most frustrating thing in the world.

** It depends on the story, how I am feeling and how willing my husband is to read it and/or who is on the discord and is willing to read through.

For really short fics or humour fics I often just write it and do a spelling and grammar check. For longer stories I will go through a couple of drafts, plus get a few others to read it. If I don't like the chapter I will rewrite it completely, which is what I'm currently doing with my WIP. My Tumblr prompts I don't bother checking at all.

** I actually don't use beta readers (though I was a beta reader before and would ask the author to send me her work chapter by chapter). I take a week to write a chapter (several hundred words a day is what I am for), then wait one to two days before I edit it. I learned with one of my earlier stories that it's best to write your chapter, no matter if half of it is complete garbage, wait at least a day, then go back and edit. I usually go through one or two drafts, but nothing more than that.

** I have a beta reader I've worked with since 2004. I'll get her opinion on specific snippets and when the chapter/one-shot is complete, she goes over it. My husband is my alpha reader and he's really good at story suggestions and such.

I definitely go through multiple drafts, but sort of in the editing and changing things as I write way, not so much the formal first draft, second draft way. I have had to scrap chapters and start over a few times until I feel like I've got it right.

** I don't use a formal beta readers program. I instead have several friends with access to a google doc, and I tell them to scan it over when I'm done with a chapter, though they sometimes do it in parts as I work.

** I only have around 220K words to pa-site but here's how it usually goes for me.

Usually I can write a chapter 5k-8k in around three days. It's pretty rare that I'll revise anything but I do have a general plan as far as where the story needs to go. I send it to my beta who firstly gives me feedback and her opinion. Afterwards she does grammar and spelling, and when I get it back I read it over once. And then I'll post it.

Only once did I completely scrap a chapter, it sucked but luckily I hadn't gotten too far into it and I actually posted it as a â€˜bonus content' to a separate story I use just of post bonus stuff to my big story.

Typically my writing is like this. I think of a scene, one scene that just captures my minds eye. From there I write it, and try to figure out what came before it and what comes after. Fanfiction is unique because you can kinda start wherever because everyone knows what's come before.
