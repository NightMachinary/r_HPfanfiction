Recently i read umbrus shade in [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/umbrus-shade-the-incredibly-annoyed-ravenclaw-harry-potter-si.48980/]] and i am enjoying it very much. Can someone please recomend me fanfiction outside of fanfiction.net and ao3. Popular ones will be great because beside umbruss shade i never read anything. Thank you so much.


** There is the [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com][www.hpfanficarchive.com]] site it hosts both original work as well as copies of certain authors work.

For instance I like Raolin's The Fires of Magic as it gives an interesting twist with harry learning a different style of magic. And it's available on both FFN and hpfanficarchive.

linkffa(1928)

Now RotaryFile who goes by Selector on FFN has his Witches Secret Trilogy on both sites. But his Our Lady O'the Bless'd Do Over series is only available on hpfanficarchive.

  The curse Voldemort cast on baby Harry had far-reaching effects on Harry's magic. Harry must now explore those effects, and magic itself, all while battling killer teachers, giant beasts, and more in a school that really needs a safety board. Luckily for Harry, he doesn't have to do this all alone. Harry/multi. Contains AU, OC characters, and more. Book One will cover first year and the events of the Philosopher's Stone.

*** While HPFanficArchive WAS good, the new owners of the site have made it difficult and annoying to read from.

**** I solve that by just downloading any story I'm interested in. If it's a WIP then i just check every month or so to see if it has been updated. If so, i download the entire story again. I do the same thing with any other site i use. Eg not enough patience to read on a chapter by chapter basis on a site.
