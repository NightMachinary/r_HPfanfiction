:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
All I can remember is that in the first chapter, Hermione is on her bed examining Tom's diary post-basilisk fang impalement, accidentally lets him out(somehow) and the two of them fight. I don't remember how they did it, but they ended up throwing themselves back to the dark ages, or medieval times, something of that sort.

To me it was actually rather reminiscent of the Dramione fic Once Upon a Thyme, in a few ways.

Help would be soooooo appreciated you guys! I've been really enjoying going back and reading through old fics I used to read so long ago!


** I'm not sure but a Tomione finds on tumblr is really helpful.

Hope you find it.
