It feels like I've read almost every actual good story that's been recommended to me and so I'm seeing if anyone could let me know of any great, underrated stories?


** I gravitated towards crossover fics once it seemed I read near everything I could find. If you're curious about some good complete fics I'll go find some of them I liked.

  Aurora Sinistra spends most of her time watching the stars. She's no centaur, but she's better than Trelawney. In the summer of 1991, she has a plan redeem the reputation of Slytherin House, and maybe some of the people inside it. Recruiting Severus Snape to help her over a game of chess, the two teachers undertake a gambit of their own that leads the Boy-Who-Lived and the Brightest Witch of Her Age into Slytherin House and friendships with Draco Malfoy.However, there is something strange going on at the school. Can the three figure out what it is that Professor Quirrell is up to and stop it? How will the changes in House and friendships effect Harry's relationship with Dumbledore and the headmaster's plans?

  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.

** All I have are slashfics but this first one is one of my favs. I highly recommend it even if u are not into slash. There is a lot of focus on the plot and I just beg you to give it a shot since it's so well planned out and the relationships between the ppl are so well written. (Of wizards and heroes)

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4148136]])

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17983598]])

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7678135]])

Some of the fics might be sad at times but I swear all of them have a happy end.

Check out this series. Three small soulmate fics. Very fluffy. One is Harry/Draco the other one is a Deanmus fic and this one is an Oliver Wood/Marcus Flint story. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5025334]])

Also this time travel fic. Bit sad at one point but Happy ending! (Ships Sirius/Harry Hermione/Remus) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4340120]])

A funny drarry fic. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14010333]])

Very sweet. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15857595]])

Linkao3(Howl by Shiftylinguini)

All of these are Novel length fics with either Draco ir Snape as a Mc/focus point These are all slashfics. Hope you don't mind. Mostly Snarry and Drarry. Hope you like them. I'll try to only rec fics that are at least 20k

Time travel (Snarry) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3188624]]) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3836032]]) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/670548]]) This fic is called the boy who died a lot. I wasn't immediately hooked but after some time I got really into it. I laughed. I cried. Really good fic. Also this is Snape pov.

A Draco/Charlie Weasley fic Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1907331]])

Snarry once again. Post-war. Harry and Snape swap bodies. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16848688]])

Post-war Drarry fic. Harry and Draco are Aurors. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20309395]])

Drarry. Amortentia fic. Harry is oblivious. (17k) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13818327]])

Drarry. Don't remember much about it tbh but I've got it bookmarked so I guess it's good. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15783759]])

A fun Drarry fic (Draco pov) post-war. Where Auror Harry gets deaged. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/391640]])

Linkffn(On a pale horse)

Sherlock x HP crossover Linkao3(1134255) Harry interacts a lot with Mycroft in this, less with Sherlock but it's one of my favorite Crossovers

  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...

I mean, it's not like him to be nice.” Neville snorted, mouth twitching rapidly. “No, it's not,” He agreed readily. “Malfoy sending this makes perfect sense though. The flower means, Beauty is your only attraction."- Or... the one where Harry and Draco have a flower war. Their tamest fight yet to date as they trade silent insults, cutting barbs and even a few compliments sprinkled in.

  Harry Potter was not above doing whatever it took to get what he wanted. It often meant he'd have to go to extreme lengths to make people suffer for their stupidity, but the results were always worth it. This Harry Potter takes things too literally. ON PURPOSE. A/N: Slytherin-Harry.

  Harry sees only one option when his name comes out of the cup - to escape where the contract can't follow; across borders where the Ministry's laws can't follow him. Where he goes changes him, and those who remained change too. Desperate measures implemented change how paths are walked for not just Harry but others too.

  Harry goes back in time due to a quirk of being the owner of the invisibility cloak (reincarnation deal). Time-travel, professor Harry with new (OC) identity, child Tom Riddle. No bashing involved. HP and canon belong to JK Rowling. Complete. This is less of a show and more of a tell story i.e. Dialogue gets really scarce at about ch. 13 and lots of time jumps.
