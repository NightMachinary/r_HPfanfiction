So I was reading a story called Reunion by a MissBinns but her name was spelt slightly different, I had it open on a tab and when I went back to read it today it won't load. All my other tabs open are still there and load fine. I've copied and pasted the link to a new tab, still no good. I've searched the website it's on (archiveofourown) and entered all the info I can remember but it's not anywhere.

So that's where you guys come in, do any of you know why this happened or where to find it again. I need to finish the story lol, I was so close.

Gahh >. <


** AO3 is having technical difficulties right now. Check your tab again later.

** There's a 'MsBinns' on fanfiction.net who has a story called Reunited. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3426838/MsBinns][Here is her profile link]] and here's, I hope, the story: linkffn(reunited by msbinns) . The Reunited story looks like it's Ron/Hermione.

  Hermione sighed, beginning to suspect that Kingsley might have just managed to get her to do something she had been putting off for years, face her past. Ten years after the war Hermione agrees to do Kingsley a favour, bringing her in contact with her friends that she hasn't seen in years.

*** That's a different author. In general if you're worried about the bot not finding the right story then you can use the URL to guarantee it: linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11113282/1/Reunited]])

  A short series of vignettes about all the times Ron and Hermione reunite following Deathly Hallows and the events of my story Australia. See my story "Dear Hermione" to read letters from Ron that accompany the story.
