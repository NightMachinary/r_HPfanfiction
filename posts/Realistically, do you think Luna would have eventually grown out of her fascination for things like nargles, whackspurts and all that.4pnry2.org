I've been wondering this for a while, because Luna was either 14 or 15 in OoTP and no one retains the exact same personality they had at that age forever. I'm not saying her personality would be completely different by the time she's an adult, but I wonder if she would move on from this particular trait.


** Didn't she grew up to actually prove the existence of one of those animals? So I guess not

*** Yep. She still never discovered a crumple-horned snorkack, though. According to JKR, she grew up to be a tiny bit more skeptical, even though it's not in the books.

Shame that those dastard snorkacks ever showed themselves.

** I feel like her beliefs are such an important part of who she is, that she would never stop believing. She would probably always be a little odd (think hippie vs non hippie), but she would likely become a little more serious as she got older. To be honest I always found it strange there were not more people like Luna (or her dad) in the magical world.

Hmmm. Luna's the only important character of Harry's age who doesn't have significant character development in the books, so maybe not.

Also, note that in canon Luna is /very/ stubborn about her ridiculous views, and defends them with all the conviction of a religious fundamentalist:

#+begin_quote
  "... and if you ever come to our house I'll be able to show you the horn, Daddy wrote to me about it but I haven't seen it yet, because the Death Eaters took me from the Hogwarts Express and I never got home for Christmas," Luna was saying, as she and Dean relit the fire.

  "Luna, we told you," Hermione called over to her. "That horn exploded. It came from an Erumpent, not a Crumple-Horned Snorkack --"

  "No, it was definitely a Snorkack horn," said Luna serenely, "Daddy told me. It will probably have re-formed by now, they mend themselves, you know."
#+end_quote

She refuses to believe the Erumpent horn is in fact an Erumpent horn and not the horn of the Crumple Horned Snorkack even when confronted with evidence, even after it almost costs her father his life. I really don't understand how Luna is supposed to be this paragon of open-mindedness; she believes whatever her father tells her or publishes in the Quibbler, regardless of whether it is about Fudge cooking Goblins or Stubby Boardman or Crumple-Horned Snorkacks, even when it goes against evidence. She strikes me as a particularly closed minded person.

Can she grow out of it? It is possible, but I don't think there is much indication of this in the books. I certainly would have liked Luna a lot better had she grown out of some of her beliefs in the books, while still maintaining her eccentric side. As she is, I am not a fan.

She is, because

  she believes whatever her father tells her or publishes in the Quibbler
#+end_quote

There's not a hint of skepticism. Her mind is so open that her brains have fallen out.

The worst thing about fanfiction Luna is that she can't shut up about nargles and wrackspurts. There's nothing there, except a broken record of crazy invisible animals.

**** Indeed - I don't mind her normally, but if she's spewing her BS all the time (without people - other than Hermione - correcting her!) then she starts to annoy the crap out of me (I'd love a fanfiction where she's told to "snap out of it!")

***** I wonder if anyone's yet written a fic where Harry gets so fed up of Luna's ramblings, like the Ravenclaws, that he joins in the bullying (unlike every other fic where he stops it and then indulges her).

****** Now that's unlikely IMHO (as much as I dislike canon Harry because I think with his upbringing he should be even less trusting of adults, more curious about magic, less accepting of backstabbing friends (Ron!), more withdrawn (introverted) etc.), because he knows how it is to be bullied (Duddley, Vernon and even Petunia - not to mention Duddley's friends!)

ps: How do I figure that? - I've been bullied at school and I'd never do it to somebody else (I might dislike somebody, but I would not do things like stealing their stuff, humiliating them in public etc.)
