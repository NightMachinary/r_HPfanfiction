So some of you may remember linkffn(King of Magic) from that discussion a while back about how +terrible+amazing it is... Great news! I just found out that [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2796140/Dragons-Twilight1992][The author]] has like 200 fics just like it! For example linkffn(Learning to Adjust by Dragons-Twilight1992) has the Potters and Sirius saved by Dumbledore and then they come back to England 2 months after Harry kills Voldemort. Apparently the Potters have 25 children, the oldest of which is 21. As in, born in 1977, probably. And Lily was born in 1960. And Harry has triplets with Ginny. Truly this is the pinnacle of the English language.

  The War had ended be with causality's & injures. Harry & Ginny are trying to cope with Teddy & his twin Andromeda as well as their three triplets that Ginny had given birth too. Now James and Lily Potter arrive with Sirius Black and the big lot of Potter children. How will Harry handle this? How will everyone cope so soon after war? How will he cope with five more fiancee's? Harem

***** Almost painful? You aren't clearly aren't properly reading the masterpieces that I've provided you with if it's /almost/ painful. These stories are so good that they are physically painful to read until you reach an enlightened state of mind.

(Also, which one did you try reading? /King of Magic/? That literary masterpiece truly embodies the concept of excellent writing and has many delightfully original ideas. I admit that /Learning to Adjust/ doesn't quite live up to the same standard, but it is fairly close.)

******* Ok, so real talk now how did you make it past the first chapter? I made it about one sentence into the second chapter before I gave up. I only made it to the end of the first chapter because I wanted to see what in the world they managed to put in ~5k words of lists haha.

** That's absolutely bizarre. It's surely a troll account? I don't see how someone with that level of learning disability could successfully write and post all that stuff. Plus she(?) seems to have the same stories posted on two separate accounts???

That said, Dumbledore's half moon spectaculars made me fall about. I may have to add one of these to my favourites.
