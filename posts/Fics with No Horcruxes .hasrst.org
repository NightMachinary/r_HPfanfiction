They are still about beating Voldemort. But horcruxes don't exist and he's beaten through other means. I remember pre deathly hollows there used to be more creative ways of solving the voldemort problem explored in fics. But post deathly hollows that kinda went away I think. Its been a long time since I've seen fics like that and I kinda want to read some.

I prefer more plot based and friendship than about romance. There can be romance its just not the main focus.

No major character /ocs or self inserts

No one of Marauders gen or older / Anyone of Harry's gen even if there's time travel

Apart from that its all good slash fem slash whatever.

It doesn't necessarily have to be Harry as main character but beating Voldemort is still the main plot.


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Chained Souls) is a great fic that deals with Voldemort's immortality in an interesting, not quite horcrux way. It's also primarily gen with a really well done Snape and Harry mentorship. However, it is a sequel to a 6th year fic, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Enemy Within) and you kind of need to read that first.

** Linkffn(The House of Potter Rebuilt). It's actually about the physical house, not the usual one talked about in fics (I forgot what to call it). There is slight Dumbledore bashing, but only Dumbledore and it doesn't really impact the story.

Edit: I forgot, it does mention horcruxes, but that's not how Harry beats Voldy.

** [[https://dracotrilogy.livejournal.com/][The Draco Trilogy]] is a very famous series written pre-OotP (so the prophecy is not a thing not to mention Horcruxes) with a very unique take on defeating Voldemort. It does have a pretty heavy focus on romance, with a Dramione/Harmony love triangle but it's not just a romance fic and it's still very plot-centric.
