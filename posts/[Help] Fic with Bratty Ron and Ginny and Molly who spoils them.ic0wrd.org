** is it [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1000707/chapters/1981738][Unlikely Heroes]] ?

it's an [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Arthur%20Weasley*s*Gideon%20Prewett/works][Arthur Weasley/Gideon Prewett]] pairing fic on AO3, with arthur leaving Molly. She end up marrying another wizard because of dumbledore.

I believe (it's an old read sorry), that only Ron and his sister are molly's blood children in this.
