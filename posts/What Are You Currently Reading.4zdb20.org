I'm currently reading linkffn(Run That By Me Again? By Sarah1281).

It's sort of like (Wait, What? by Publicola). Applying third person logic to the author's plot.

So like the title says, what are you reading?

Edit: Rest in peace my inbox. I didn't know that I'll be stirring the hornet's nest by asking that question. Lol

**** I don't like the overly political stuff in the first year, but I saw a description for it around in this sub calling it the good twin of HPMOR, which I agree with. It makes Harry smarter and more cunning, but not as ridiculously as HPMOR. It's the first HP fanfic that tries to make one of the trio (Harry or Hermione) smarter that I've read that doesn't disappoint me.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  It goes without saying that a witcher's life is one of thankless peril: brutal training, mutations, vagrancy, and all they get for it are insults and a few coins to tide them over to the next contract. Still, to be a witcher is to lead an fascinating life, and Harry tries to make the most of his. Heavy AU.

** I just finished /Soul Play/ by Snapesforte (no longer online). Enjoyed it to begin with but lost interest about a third of the way through and forced myself to finish it in hopes it would get better. I didn't much like Snape's characterisation, though I can get behind the argument it's more canon-complient than many portrayals of him; I guess I just like my Snape with a bit of softness to him (though not completely soft-hearted OOC). I also didn't like the portrayal of Snape/Narcissa; if they weren't fucking then they were arguing, and I'd have prefered the story without the relationship. I enjoyed the actual plot stuff, but it felt like the relationship overshadowed it all.

This was me for all three books in the series. Read the first one, liked it well enough, but it was really long and I was kinda tired of it and didn't want to read the sequel. Few months later, couldn't find a good fanfic, so I went back to read the sequel. Again, enjoyed it well enough, but not enough read the third part, which I finally read six month after that.

This one isn't fully revealed until the very end of the third book.

But yes, I can imagine the fic to be very frustrating to those who don't like waiting a million words for answers to the mystery. I mean, I usually love this sort of thing, and even I got a bit tired of it. There is still some pretty good stuff though, and I'm glad I read the series.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  Trust shattered, believing his first love has been torn from him forever, Harry grimly dons the mantle of Warrior of the Light. Half a world away, a brilliant witch in a southwestern coven does her best to aid him. Forces are trying to keep them apart, but this IS a Harmony AU. Rated for violence, familiar character death, and future sexual situations. Thanks to Raum for the Latin!

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

** At the moment, it's linkffn(Alone, Together by Failte200) again, but the last HP fic I read was probably linkffn(Bound With Silver Threads by Snakequeen-in-Norway).

If you're even passingly familiar with Kim Possible, or the concept, go read Alone, Together. Hell, even if you're not. It's a /very/ interesting take on the 'trapped in elevator with worst enemy' concept, in which the 'elevator' is staggeringly large, and the walls are conceptual. It's a slow burn romance with strains of post-apocalyptic adventure, set mostly in an alternate universe where everyone spontaneously vanished the moment Kim and Shego arrived. Naturally, this causes enormous issues, as things are no longer maintained, the remnants of civilisation begin to crumble, and Kim and Shego deal with the psychological impact of being crushingly, pitifully alone.

I confess I got about 90% of the way through Silver Threads and got bored due to a combination of slow pacing and seemingly irrelevant slice-of-life stuff. It had genuinely funny moments, but not enough to keep my interest, and the nature of the romance was sweet but not super interesting. I prefer mine with a bit of bite, rivalmancing, etc.
