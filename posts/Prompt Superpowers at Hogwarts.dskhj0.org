In Chamber of Secrets, Hermione temporarily became a cat-girl, and although in canon she was completely cured of this, I would like to see a fic where she retained cat-like reflexes, enhanced hearing, sight, and smell, and a predilection towards mischievous behavior. Meanwhile, Ron is bitten by a mutant acromantula during the escape from Aragog, developing enhanced reflexes, the ability to climb pretty much anything, and the ability to produce webbing. At the end of the year, Harry is bitten by the basilisk and healed with phoenix tears, so he develops the ability to sense heat like a snake, enhanced senses of smell, sight, and hearing, a poisonous "acid spit" that burns like phoenix fire, and flight.

Any other students developing powers from weird accidents would be great too. Neville turning into a plant person like Swamp Thing or Poison Ivy, Snape turning into Man-Bat due to a potions accident, etc. Crack, serious, or some mixture, any is good. Any pairings except [Insert Death Eater Here]/[Insert Harry or Hermione Here]. Thanks!

Or, when he was dropped out of a window, his magic turned him into living rubber, which is why he bounced.

** I think there are some fanfiction exploiting the "Hermione is a catgirl" (and/or "Hermione is a neko-girl"). Though they quickly devolve (or involve, depends on your shipping armanda) into a Harmony story (with some goes straight for lemon and smutty)

*** It's really a shame too. I just want some Hermione has cat powers fic, crack or otherwise, but they all revolve around shipping or smut :(

** "Miss Weasley! Roaming the halls after curfew is never appropriate."

The possessed body of Pomona Sprout turned around with a pout that looked terribly inappropriate on her matronly face. "I was just checking the library for my homework! honest."

"Nevertheless," said McGonagall dryly, "Students are not allowed outside their house dormitories after nine pm, in ANY form. That includes possession via the written word. Really, your professors shouldn't have to fear grading your homework. Ten points from Gryffindor, and I ask that you exit Professor Sprout immediately."

*** He's already Batman. Brooding, tortured, working in the shadows to protect the good fight, ready to be the villain so as to do good. The accident instead should turn him into Bruce Wayne! Ditsy, playboy-ish foil to Lucius Malfoy, getting Narcissa and Fleur to swoon over him, targeted by Madame Zabini, etc.

**** Albus sat in his comfy chair to ponder about his most recent dilemma. Brendt Wright, the young man had appeared seemingly out of nowhere and had integrated himself into high society, charming everybody he talked to, and using a ridiculous amount of money to curry the favor of the powerful, and to give charity for apparently no good reason, nobody knew where he came from, nobody knew what he wanted, though there were some rumors about him making a killing with potion patents, Albus had been so far unable to unravel anything, every time he went to investigate the supposed labs everything was suspiciously empty and perfectly clean, as if someone had just cleared the site, what a problem! he would have to consult with Severus again, he was sure to know something

** When people get bored of what's on the telly they channel surf. When 5th dimensional beings get bored of watching something they dimension surf.

Mxyzptlk smiled to himself as he found something interesting. There nestled between two different realities was a wisp of a dream. Nothing more than a passing thought that burst into existence and would disappear equally as fast.

Mxyzptlk grabbed the idea and gave it more substance. It could grow now into something real one day. Either way it would be something interesting that was for sure.

A world of Hogwarts where people through unlikely events gained super powers. To make it better he made sure the knowledge of comic book worlds was known to some at Hogwarts! Oh such fun to be had!
