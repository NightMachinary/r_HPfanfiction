Curious does anyone know any fanfic similar to if wishes were pony's. It they don't have to be a cross with my little pony thought.


** What do you like about it? The fluff? The Embassy? The talking down of Dumbledore by Twilight? Or is it something else? If you can give me a general feel of what you liked it will help me greatly.

*** The fluff is a part of it. But mostly it's the way the magical and British government reaction to the ponies and to there world in general.

**** Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11500936/1/Long-Live-The-Queen]]) Was the fanfic that I read to scratch my Harry Potter muggle/magical politics itch because /If Wishes were Ponies/ wasn't updating fast enough for me.

I very much enjoyed [[https://canoncansodoff.fanficauthors.net/Muggle_Summer_Wizards_Fall/index/][Muggle Summer, Wizard's Fall]], it gives me the same vibe as some of the Embassy chapters.
