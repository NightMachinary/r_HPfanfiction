Looking for someone who harms Hermione and Harry absolutely looses it.


** I would adore a trio fic wherein someone causes actual hurt to Hermione and the rest of the world has to react to Harry no longer indulging the timid act and Ron no longer acting like a goofball. Basically the whole Wizarding world gets a front row seat to what happens when Harry and Ron decide shit has gotten personal ie. Their handling of Lockhart in CoS.

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)

** I would like to see the opposite! :) Like canon compliant but not, where after Hermione finds out about the blood quill abuse she tells the Aurors or Dumbledore about it, instead of listening to the abused boy and LETTING HIM keep going with it and getting himself abused even more. Because that's horrific and sad. :( And Hermione and Ron are horrible for not telling anyone about it no matter WHAT Harry wanted.

  AU OotP. What if Hermione had taken a more proactive stance against Harry's treatment by Snape and Umbridge? How far is too far to go to protect someone you love? Complete.
