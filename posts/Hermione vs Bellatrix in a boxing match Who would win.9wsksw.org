** ...First, define winning? Bellatrix is way too insane to keep playing by the rules in the heat of physical combat. The match would most likely end in her choking Hermione to death or something.

Also, I think this heavily depends on each character's age. A teenage Hermione will be crushed either way, and no one likes /Cursed Child/ (40-years-old Minister Hermion's only turn so far), so let's assume that she's a young adult. But is Bellatrix in her prime, or in her 1990's post-Azkaban self? Because 1970's Bellatrix would probably beat Hermione in terms of physical fitness, but I'm not so sure she ever fully recovered from her "half-starved Azkaban prisoner" state.
