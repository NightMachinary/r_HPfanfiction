There's this scene where Harry is getting to know Lily and James at dinner table, but they inadvertently causes Harry to become disgusted with them, when they say harsh words to Rose because she's a Hufflepuff.


** Reminds me a bit of the interlude of linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9720211/1/The-Merging]]). Not sure it had a Hufflepuff Rose though. Or if she was even called Rose. :/

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?
