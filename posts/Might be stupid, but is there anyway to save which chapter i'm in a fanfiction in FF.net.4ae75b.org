** Considering that the chapters are separate web pages with the chapter number spelled out plainly in the URL why don't you just bookmark them?

**** If you use chrome and keep the tabs open on the device you're reading on, it automatically syncs across all your devices and you can open them up whenever you want

***** This. I've been doing this for ages and it really is the best way to consume FanFiction.

Research and find promising looking fics on my PC, pin the tab to Chrome, open it on my phone after it syncs.

** My personal ff.net-worlflow is mainly like this:

- Completed fanfictions are just downloaded on my kindle by [[http://www.fanfictiondownloader.net/webversion_kindle.php]] . That way the problem of remembering the chapter becomes irrelevant.

- Ongoing fanfictions are added with the various apps/ extensions by [[https://getpocket.com]] with the chapter I want to read next. (ProTip: Get an extra tag for fanfictions/ prose.)

So far all my reading needs were covered by these.
