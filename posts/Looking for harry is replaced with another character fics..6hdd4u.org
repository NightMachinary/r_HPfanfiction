I just finished a fic where a 22 or 23 year old xander replaced harry in the beginning of third year, and harry replaced xander. They both had knowledge of each others worlds xander up to book six. Harry i don't know, because i skipped that part.

What i'm looking for is a story with a similer premise. It can be anyone from xander to alucard to even madara if you wanted. If the character could have some knowledge of the HP world that would be appreciated as well. The last thing i ask for is if possible the story could be complete or at least past third year.

Thanks in advance.

**** not really what I was expecting.. I though Xander was going to be in Harry's body or at least Xander's memories. That one is.. weird.

  When Naruto died at the hands of a civilian during his academy days, so did the Kyuubi no Kitsune. Now here the Kyuubi was, reincarnated, and bouncing around in an eleven year old girl's body, while half the wizarding world treated her like the second coming of Merlin (whoever that was)... and the rest didn't know what to make of her...[HP/Naruto fic utilising dubious canon elements. You have been warned!]

** I fucking love that kind of story so I know a few of them.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12191695/1/Project-Tsuki-no-Me][Project Tsuki No Me]]: Madara Uchiha (Naruto)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11132888/1/The-Dementor-and-the-Mind-Game][The Dementor and the Mind Game]]: Ender Wiggum (Ender's Game)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5503251/1/Memories-of-a-Former-Life][Memories of a Former Life]]: Sosuke Aizen, sorta (Bleach)

- Harry starts remembering chunks of Aizen's life and his personality starts changing. Really wish that this one had gotten further.

- Similar sort of thing, Harry gets memories. Still updating though.
