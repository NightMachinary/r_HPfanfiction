Looking for any stories or one-shots that delve into the Deathly Hallows business.

/For instance,/ in my fic the cloak is more like a full body cloak with holes to put your arms in and such, and when wrapped in it you disappear completely though are not quite incorporeal.

Add the stone (Hear voices of the dead) and the wand (Be the /Champion/ of the dead), it would allow the /Master of Death/ almost unlimited apprenticeship possibilities to long-dead tutors.


** Perspicacity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4889913/1/Hallows-and-Pathos][Hallows and Pathos]] has a different take on them.

My first chapter covers one use a bit. If you can summon the shades of the dead you can presumably steal their memories and skills too. The rest involves a low power Harry and is less Deathly Hallowy.
