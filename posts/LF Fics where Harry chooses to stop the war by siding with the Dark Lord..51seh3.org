So, I read this final battle one shot a while back (I don't remember the name) where Harry and the Dark Lord had been exchanging letters, and when the Dark Lord and his followers show up at the school for the final battle, Harry approaches the Dark Lord and hands him his wand. It was an interesting one shot, but I haven't seen any full length fics with the same premise. I've read lots of Harry goes dark fics, but none where he just surrenders. So I'm wondering if anyone else has any suggestions. My only requirement is that they be decently written, and not abandoned (complete is preferred, but I'll take anything that's been updated recently). Slash is fine. I'm not a huge fan of soul bonds and mpreg but it's not an instant no for me either. I actually haven't found a trope that's an instant no yet...


** linkffn(3000137). Harry doesn't really surrender, but he just never fights and doesn't side with Dumbledore. It's not technically complete, but all it's really missing is an epilogue.

  AU, where nothing as simple as good vs. evil. A summer spent trapped in Number 4 and barred from contact with his friends leads to Harry accepting an offer to correspond with a Death Eater. The consequences of thinking for oneself are far reaching.

  Immortality is not all it's cracked up to be. At least not when the only other immortal around is your worst enemy and the closest thing to a friend you have left. The war ended over a hundred years ago and Harry Potter and Tom Riddle have each been enjoying the quiet life, whilst politely ignoring each other. However, war is coming. AU. Complete.

  Voldemort has made a bargain with Harry to stop killing muggles and muggle-borns (when at all possible, of course) in exchange for Harry's cooperation. While Harry thinks he's using the time to find a way to defeat the Dark Lord, he will realize that Voldemort is always one step ahead, and so long as he isn't killing anyone...what's the big deal? He has bigger things to worry about now, anyway. Includes dementors, pureblood culture, the prophecy, what exactly happened with Lily's sacrifice, magical breakthroughs, children Death Eaters, and portraits of family. Final pairing: H/D. Sequel to Black, in the Smothering Dark. Beta'd by laureen@livejournal.
