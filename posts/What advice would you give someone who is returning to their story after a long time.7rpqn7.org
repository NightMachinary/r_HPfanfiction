*** I say be careful with posting a shorter chapter! I had an old HP xover that I stopped working on for a long time, and so many people were just begging for another chapter that I caved and posted a half-finished scene that I wasn't sure of. The begging for updates stopped, but in its place was a horde of hate-filled reviews saying it would have been better to have never updated ever again. (That was terribly mean of them, but I dropped the story immediately and haven't looked at it since. I took it as a sign that I should move onto other projects.).

Make sure to explain why it's shorter than normal, and don't rush to put up a rough, short chapter as soon as possible. Your readers waited a year; they can wait another month if you need that time. Definitely tell the readers that the updates won't be as frequent, but be wary of those that skip author's notes, and make sure the short chapter is a treat instead of a sloppy rough draft with no payoff.

**** Unless the numbers were dropped from 10k to like 2k I can't believe someone would bash a author coming back to one of my favorites

***** Some people get really upset over fanfiction they like. It wasn't a very serious work, and I had a lot of fun writing it, but I didn't outline a thing and I'd already dug myself several plot holes. People tend to just eat up HP xovers, so I honestly had hundreds of people favoriting the story without even trying. None of my HP xovers have ever gone past 35k words in total.

The current fanfictions I'm working on are for much smaller fandoms, with smaller audiences, but I'm much happier and prouder in working on them.

  how in the world do I not let my readers down after such a long wait?

If you were posting 12k words a week or even every other week, you probably were having a lot of fun and not thinking too hard about things. Which is great, because it means that readers liked the same things you liked, so as long as /you/ are you having fun/are interested in your writing, the majority of your readers should be as well.

Also, readers want to like your work. Especially those who have a history reading your stuff. If there's a few rough edges as you get back into the swing of things, most people either aren't going to see them (most people) or won't hate them (most of the rest).

You're still you, and readers liked you before so there's no reason they shouldn't now. Write and have fun and that probably gets you a lot further than you think.

** If you have an unfinished story, just start up again. People will be so pumped that the story isn't abandoned that all will be forgotten.

** I started my story in 2005. Now 12 years later, I'm 2 chapters away from completion (both chapters almost done). Yay me!

I guess never give up. It's ok to put your story on hiatus for years. I did. I also almost abandoned it when it got too hard. But then one day an idea or ideas just sparks life back into it. Another reason it's taken so long, besides a busy RL, is that I only write when I have the urge to. Because if I'm forced to, then there's no joy in doing it and the fic suffers.

** Read everything over to get back in the groove. If you're not ready to tackle the main story, write one or two one shot side stories in the same setting as a warmup. Even if you don't put them out, it's still a good exercise.

** My advice would be to not let your story take over your life. Your studies are much, much more important. I read/wrote Fanfiction when I went through college but used it as more of an outlet when I got completely stressed and needed a breather. Remember to focus on your academics and do as much as you can (without overworking yourself) as you go through it.

** I'm in the same boat, trying to continue a fanfic I stopped updating about two years ago. In my case, I decided to write several chapters before I start posting again. After such a long time, my original outline doesn't work for me anymore, and I want to have a solid idea of where my story is going. I think it gives me more freedom while writing. I can go back and change things around, add a paragraph or delete a sentence...

Of course, what works for me doesn't have to work for you, but my advice is to spend some time just writing and reacquainting yourself with your world and characters before you post and make it official.

** I have just done the same thing, except life got in the way, not college lol Best place to start is by reading. I reread my stories, and took notes the second time! The downside is, now I've read it over and over I can see the mistakes. Don't worry about them, you can fix them later. Second thing is to read a few others, get back into the fandom. See what's going on. That helped me get into the groove. If you have notes, match them up to the notes you took while you were rereading it. And then, be prepared for the possibility of less interest from your readers. Fandoms change, people move on like you did. You'll get new people who aren't as invested to begin with, so don't let the odd bad review knock you down. Good luck!

** Reread your story like your a fan of your own work, reestablish what is going on and where you want the story to go, the worst thing to do is come back and run off in a different direction from where you were headed.

Don't worry about massive word counts, word counts don't matter. If you can do a stead and consistent 5-7k words a week you can keep people interested in the story.

Don't focus on the first 15 reviews that bitch about something or just say 'great chapter write more' look at the reviews that talk exactly why they did or didn't like something that express
