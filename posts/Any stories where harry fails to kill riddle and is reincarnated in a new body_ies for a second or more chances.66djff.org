Sorry, by body, i mean reincarnation into A whole new person who's born to new parents but he has the knowledge of harry potter: for example, there's a seven year old french kid named sophitia marceu who is actually harry potter trying to live as a seven year old and not blow his cover until he's fogured out a way to do away with riddle.


** figured*

Also, the FF community is very afraid of AU's so I'm not sure there would be anything interesting out there regarding this topic...
