Part of this is in response to the thread 'I applaud the mods for not taking this comment down.' ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5umihv/i_applaud_the_mods_for_not_taking_this_comment/]])

But before I start, let me start off with a story of a 25-year-old person, someone who uses the Internet quite a lot, someone who writes Fan Fics as a hobby. Now that person decides to sign up to Reddit and subscribes to a few subs that pique his interest. One of those subs is [[/r/HPFanFiction]], having read somewhere that it is quite recommended for FanFic authors who write fan Fics of Harry Potter.

A few months later, and several posts later, he suggests a storyline on a sub for one of his Fics that's a bit different, a bit out of the normal way, as he had wanted to write about something that happens in real life to some female Prisoners of War, featuring one of the tropes that Death Eaters do to females.

After that suggestion, the whole sub turns on him like a clique, all because this 25-year-old wanted to write, and was merely wanting suggestions on how the original idea could be improved, how he could go around it in a different way.

A few weeks later he asks about Fics that feature other topics, some that he had wanted to see how other authors had tackled them, so again he could improve his own future works, and gets some comments from people which cause him to feel angry, feel down, almost driven to want to end everything what with the from both the forum, his home life, several other personal things, and his job. Subsequently he announces to the sub that he intends to leave, fed up because of the way people are treating him.

A few days later he becomes calmer and realises the usefulness of the sub, rejoining it. What happens then is that he is constantly treated like shit by the sub, their clique style behaviour getting worse.

Then along comes a thread, one which the first comment causes me to be really offended. What makes it worse is nothing is done when it is reported through the official channels of the sub.

Along comes another thread, posted by a member of the clique, which congratulates the first comment of the other thread for his actions and also the lack of reaction from the moderation team.

Now imagine that person has several problems (one of which means that in a way he is unfiltered in what he says), is in a highly stressful job, is fed up of being bullied and now gets treated like this on the sub.

It's surprising I am still alive.

No. People don't like you because you constantly write rapefics where you try to "justify" the rape.

If the user in the other thread is not just your alt (you do seem to enjoy being baited and throwing yourself pity parties), then they're completely out of line for targeting you like that. However, the hostility towards you isn't some concerted effort, but rather a result of the shallow, vulgar, and repellent things you choose to write about and promote.

*** To add, it takes a certain kind of obliviousness to openly talk about how offended you are about people's response to your clearly offensive content. When you write about sensitive subjects, people will criticise you if you haven't done it with sensitivity. That in and of itself is not bullying. If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.

But [[/u/GryffindorTom][u/GryffindorTom]], I mean this with absolute sincerity and genuine care for your well being. If you are feeling suicidal or depressed, please seek professional help. Even if it is just a call to the Samaritans. Do not try to find therapy and unconditional support in an online community. Cliquey stuff happens, people can be blunt and mean. That just comes with the Internet. I won't comment on your general behaviour, but I also won't apologise for my own criticism of the type of things you write because I believe they are genuinely harmful and disturbing. I do suggest you take a step back until you're in a better place mentally. As a young man you're at particular risk, so you really do need to reach out to someone who has the capacity to help you.

**** And to make it worse, because out of general curiosity I went and read three of the fics he advertises in his post history, he writes about sensitive, offensive topics poorly.

He claims he's a twenty-five year old man and he writes openly about rape in a way that comes off as a sexual fantasy and uses the justification of 'things happen in real life'.

Well sure, things happen in real life, but you really don't hear about a lot of multi-day long gang rapes with toys and men coming and going in an almost comical way.

Rape is arguably the worst thing a human being can do to another human being. It takes away a sense of self, it takes away pride, it takes away the most intimate details of a person, it's scarring both physically and emotionally and it takes one of the most intimate and loving acts humans are capable of and turns it into something grotesque.

But his stories ignore that. They turn into the men using the women for sexual gratification and control. They do not focus in any way that's realistic, which if you're claiming 'you want tow rite about stuff that happens in the real world' they should, on the aftermath for the woman. Or more often, the rather young teenage girl.

You've written stories that come off as sexual gratification and wish fulfillment about the most heinous thing a human can do to another human. And when it's pointed out how little you actually understand the topic, you flounce off and talk about bullying.

You want to write about rape? Look at how Game of Thrones handled it in Season Five and Six. Look at the 'Employee of the Month' episode of The Sopranos. Look at the novel Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson.

I'll leave you with a quote by Hemingway: "No subject is terrible if the story is true, if the prose is clean and honest, and if it affirms courage and grace under pressure"

Your stories do not hold up to any of those standards. If you want to write about rape and how it happens in the real world, write about HOW it happens in the real world. Write about the people it destroys and how they have to learn to live again. Don't write about which male has the most orgasms.

***** I disagree. If someone wants to write a story, for sexual gratification or not, they can do so. It may be distasteful, it my be disgusting, it may be offensive, but it's their story.

Should we start telling other authors how, if they want to write about the Malfoy or Black family, they should focus on the horrors bigotry and racism have caused to people? How people writing about house-elves should be writing about the evils of slavery? Should all "pranking" fics focus on how that's usually bullying?

I started writing fanfiction because I read one too many "marriage law" story, which are, far too often, "rape means love" stories (yes, forcing people to marry and have children means forcing them to have sex, which is rape). But hey - I'll not demand, no matter how distasteful I find this trope, other authors to stop writing their kind of stories, where two people forced to marry will discover that they actually love each other.

And I'll certainly not try to bully them into writing only the stories I like.

****** I don't care what he or anyone else writes. My point was more because his post history is filled with him trying to defend the gratuitous rape in his fics with 'well it happens in life' and the fact that in other posts he's claimed that he isn't doing it for that reason. Then he whines about the negativity he gets in reviews and from others because of a topic he writes about in almost the exact opposite way he claims he's trying to present it.

It's more of a 'Hey, if you want to do it, go for it but don't be surprised when people call you on it' type deal. He's either just very bad at presenting his theme, in which case I hope my post offered suggestions, or flat out lying about his intentions

In his post history he is on record as saying he wants to write about how rape happens in the real world. But his stories don't focus on the 'real world' aspects of the rape. So I offered suggestions where he could look to get that.

I agree that people can write whatever they want.

** If this sub is negatively impacting your health, it may be in your own best interest to find somewhere else to spend your time. Your health comes first, after all, and I believe there are still a few active harry potter fanfiction forums around that I'm sure would be happy to welcome you.

Sometimes people just don't fit within a certain forum culture, and that's okay. I certainly don't fit in everywhere. But if you don't receive the empathy you're searching for in this thread, might I suggest [[/r/SuicideWatch]]?

** This sub is not a safe space for people who advocate rape. This sub is not a psychologists office. This sub is not responsible for your or anyone else's mental health.

We (and I speak for myself and anyone who chooses to voice their agreement with me through votes and comments, not those who are silent) don't like your opinions. We don't like that you trashed our community and stormed off. We don't like that you slinked back in like nothing happened. We don't like that it's pretty obvious you're trying to start shit again. We don't like that your flair implies you've come here to run roughshod over what we've created. In short, we don't like you.

If that makes you sad or suicidal, that's not our responsibility. We care about humans and mental health in general, but it's not our responsibility to babysit every random person that comes in regardless of what they say or do to our community. Just like in real life, if you don't fit in the community, we don't have to keep you around.

If you need mental help, and it definitely sounds like you either are depressed or have some attention disorder, both of which require professional help, then you need to seek that for yourself. Quit playing games, quit fantasizing about rape, quit feeling sorry for yourself, and go talk to a doctor.

And disliking or not but when someone's history is full of such stuff people are wont to be harsher on that person which he does not seem to be getting.

Hold your horses there. This is certainly not happening. There may be some weird or poorly written fics but if anyone was actually advocating rape, it wouldn't have turned into a multi-thread shitshow like this. You're stretching what happened in order to justify the outrage.

And downvoting me just proves him right about this sub.

I agree that the bullying sucks and some people on this sub are really overly harsh on authors/fics that fall a bit off the beaten path, but all this drama/whinging isn't going to help.

Your main objection is that someone posted your name in reference to authors who write disturbing fics in a thread that asked for those? Meh... I guess that's just their opinion man.
