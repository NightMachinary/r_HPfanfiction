Okay, so I started reading New Blood by artemisgirl and got hooked. Now that I'm all caught up, I need some stuff to get my fix. One of my favorite parts is Slytherin!Hermione and the ship teasing with a lot of rare pairings.

And since I've pretty much mined the Slytherin!Hermione genre and read all the best ones, what remains is...

I'm looking for well-written rare pairings with Hermione.

Hermione/Cedric, Hermione/Ernie McMillan, Hermione/Anthony Goldstein, Hermione/Fred, Hermione/Blaise, etc.

Any recommendations to help get me through social distancing?


** Hermione/Cedric fic that is pretty much rom-com fluff in the best way. I've read it about 5 times now. Good dialogue too.

** I am so sorry. I am so, so sorry for this recomendation. It's delightful. It's addictive.

It's... A rarepair. A series on the best written ever Hermione Granger/Marcus Flint with the best world building I've seen yet. Of course, it''s by Seselt.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/332896][Here you go.]]

Enjoy.

** I don't know how rare it is, since I don't usually keep track of pairings, but linkffn(Canis Major by amidtheflowers) is a Hermione/Sirius pairing.

  Curses. Dark curses, rather, weren't very fun at all, and certainly not when Hermione keeps waking up in a different decade because of one. At least the company wasn't half bad. Oneshot.

** The rarest Hermione pairing I've read -- Hermione/Tom Riddle Snr. It may seem weird but it's very, very good. You can really see where TMR got his brain from. linkao3(In the Bleak Midwinter)

Another one is Hermione/Regulus. Post-war, very nice pacing and characterizations. linkao3(Ready For The Storm)

Hermione/Orion Black. Surprisingly realistic (as realistic as you could come with Time Travel and a background character). An interesting perspective on Orion, as well. linkffn(Touched Your Lips)

The Prisoner of Nurmengard is Hermione/Abraxas Malfoy. No time travel. Hermione is somewhat OOC, some mild Ron bashing, original magic/rituals. Still, an interesting take on a rare/pairing. Worth giving it a try at least. linkao3(The Prisoner of Nurmengard)

I also have some Hermione/DE and Tomione/Volmione to recommend if you're interested? And if Tomione counts as rare (because for me it doesn't).

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

  Regulus flexed his feet, feeling the bite of his newish shoes and shaking his head. It was a bit of maudlin folly to be dressed as he was, in his best robes, his hair arranged just so. He doubted he would remain in such pristine condition by the end of the evening. More so, he doubted anyone would understand the significance even if he was found.

  A Healer who travels back in time accidentally to cure Abraxas Malfoy from Dragon Pox. Sounds impossible, but Hermione finds herself in that very position. The Malfoys do not leave this be and Hermione now has allies to bring down Voldemort. Only if she hadn't met with a young struggling Sirius Black. There is one more person she can't resist.
