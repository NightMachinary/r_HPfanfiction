1. I shall try this again. I'm not sure if it's finished or not but i do know it on the shorter side and it has a scene where Sirius and Hermione are arguing( because of unresolved sexual tension). Then when they do finally get together they dont come out of the room for days. They are I believe residing in 12 Grimmauld place. Hermione is an adult and it is not a time travel. Im not to sure but it is after the war. Thanks.

2. This as i stated in the title is also a Hermione/Sirius. Hermione is also an adult in this one. It happened after the war. Sirius comes out the veil and his senses are amplified but no one knew until Hermione figured it out. He is drinking alot too. Harry and Ginny are married and pregnant. Ginny doesn't want Sirius around and Harry follows her lead. Hermione at one point yells at Harry for not caring about Sirius or looking for the reason why he Sirius was acting that way. I do not think this one was finished.


** Linkffn(The Light at the End by Pelepsen) is the second one you're looking for! The first sounds familiar as well but I don't remember off the top of my head, I'll update if I remember though. This is one of my fav pairings!
