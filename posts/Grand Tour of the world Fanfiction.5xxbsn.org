Has anyone written any kind of (preferebly lengthy) grand tour fic? Elphias Dodge mentions in Book 7 that he and Dumbledore were supposed to do the traditional Grand Tour of the world together. I'm wondering if any fic has explored this topic?

I am good with any pairings, eras and AUs are fine as well. I would prefer it to be the main point of the story as well and if we're talking preferences the ideal is in a post-Vodlemort world
