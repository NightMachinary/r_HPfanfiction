I've read a few of these in the past, but they never seem to be completed, or if they are, they're shoddily done. So if anyone knows a fic where Harry goes back in time and adopts or befriends Tom Riddle, or the opposite happens instead ( Tom adopting/befriending Harry in the the present ), I'd love to see recs!


** The only one like that I've read is linkffn(Altered Destinies by DobbyElfLord). He initially goes back to kill Riddle, but ends up adopting him. It's long, complete, and pretty well done.

  DONE! Harry has defeated Voldemort, but it was a costly victory. Aberforth Dumbledore presents a plan to go back and kill the infant Riddle, but Harry will have to stay there 10 years. Can Harry alter the wizarding world's destiny? WWII and Grindelwald

** Harry adopts Tom:

linkao3(If Them's the Rules by MayMarlow) Probably eventual slash. I didn't read too far.

linkao3(The Abyss by AislingSiobhan) Warnings: Rape, imprisonment, child abuse, generally fucked up and unhealthy relationships galore. Slash. It's pretty well written though.

linkffn(Liberate Me by Tirith works) Harry/Grindelwald slash, but the author seemed to have gone on a hiatus before Grindelwald even made an appearance. Well-written but tragically unfinished.

There was also another one on AO3, a one-shot where Harry went back to kill Tom but ended up taking him instead. The one part I remember clearly was that Tom became attracted to Harry and basically drug-raped him after he graduated from Hogwarts, and then they separated for some time. Didn't save it because I felt the situation wasn't handled very well, though up to that point it was alright. Can't remember the name.

Harry befriends Tom Riddle (I'm assuming you're looking for simple friendship, so all romance fics are excluded):

linkffn(Welcome to Hogwarts 1949) WIP.

Tom befriends Harry in the present:

linkffn(Fate's Favourite by the Fictionist) This one is finished. In its prequel Past's Player Harry and Tom became sort of friends, but the writer put that one on hold before it could really happen, so all that's currently in PP is a sort of intense rivalry, thus why I didn't recommend this one in the previous category.

Tom adopts Harry in the present:

linkffn(The Counterfeit Cousin by Tsume Yuki) Unfinished. Haven't read it yet.

  [HP/LV] Nietzsche was right: when fighting monsters, Harry should have been more careful not to become one himself. That didn't matter anymore. It was too late to save himself, yet he could still save the world from Voldemort. But who would save Voldemort from him?

  Unable to accept the aftermath of the war, Harry decides to travel back in time to become the parent Tom Riddle obviously should have had. Except that things don't go as planned and Harry finds himself part of a game with hidden rules, trying to survive while raising a boy whose understanding of family has nothing to do with love.

  In which Lucius Malfoy decides to off a political opponent with a little black book and Tom Riddle finds himself with a new body and a lot of catching up to do. Of course, the orphan beneath the stairs is just happy that a family member finally came to rescue him. A Tom adopts Harry, somewhat dark fic.

  Time-travel, sort of. DH AU. MoD!Harry. Slash. / Harry is (re)born in 1909. His goal: prevent the rise of Voldemort and save the world. As for Grindelwald?

  You always get the stories where Harry goes back into Tom Riddle's time, then either stays or gets sent back. End of, unless he tries to make Voldemort good. But what if things went differently? What if, just once, someone followed a time traveller back?

** Earlier in the year I read a fic that was at least 300k words long(could be wrong?) where Harry, when in limbo with Dumbledore, basically told him to go fuck himself, and he touched the representation of the horcrux that was once in his head. He goes back to Tom Riddle's time at Hogwarts and eventually befriends him. I didn't finish it but what I did read of it very well done.
