1. Why does the Hogwarts Express exist? What is it's purpose when there is a Floo Network?
2. Why is Hogwarts a boarding school when there is a Floo Network? Or why isn't the boarding school aspect of it optional? It should be simple for students to commute back and forth as needed.

Now the Doylist reasons are obvious - that's how JKR imagined it. But what do you think the Watson logic is behind those things?


** Before Pottermore nerfed it, I had a notion that there used to be a pilgrimage of those young people being collected to receive their magical education. It was done yearly, but the students wouldn't normally return home until they had reached a skill level that could keep their powers in check and enough sense to prevent others from controlling them. So every year after the harvest, the professors would travel to the places where stories of remarkable children were being told, found out who had the gift and 'bought' them from their parents for the next five years (apprenticeships in the muggle world operated the same way).

Later on, the walking pilgrimage became a caravan. As it had evolved, people had taken note of the friendships being forged during the often difficult journey, and it grew into a part of the Hogwarts experience just as much as being Sorted or casting your first flawless spell.

Some purebloods might have wanted to skip the arduous journey, but the wiser ones knew that alliances are forged under conditions of shared hardship.

After the Statutes were implemented, the Ministry took note that the pilgrimage/caravan was getting a bit too conspicuous. At first they used a mix of quick travel methods, but the purebloods didn't want to subsidize muggleborns by paying for their Floo powder or portkeys. A ship was contemplated, but the first test voyage was beset by storms (likely induced by the young passengers' discomfort, which shows that accidental magic doesn't always act for the benefit of its creator). Suffice to say, the ship plan sank.

Thus, when the implementation of rail lines came about, the Wizarding world was only too happy to leverage it for their own needs.

In later years, there has been an observation that the students are very ready to listen to their Professors when they've been stuck waiting for a whole day with nothing better to do.

  Though it may not seem like it, the creation of the Hogwarts Express was actually a rather logical solution to a very real problem.

** 1. I think that mass flu transit is a difficult thing to coordinate, and who knows what would happen if two people flue to the same place all at once. Take apperation for example, if you aren't exact or if you don't concentrate then you get splinched.
2. Same as above. The process of mass transporting hundreds of students day in and day out is bound to cause accidents. There is also the fact that Muggle-born kids can't practice at home putting magical raise kids at an advantage.

TL;DR logistic reasons on mass transport daily over a few times a year

** [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/the-hogwarts-express]]

Answers to all questions here are there.

7 book series explanations:

Muggleborns and the statute of secrecy are causes for the Hogwarts Express.

Via the fireplace we see Harry have a conversation with a wanted man and no one (on the Ministry side) was the wiser until they were purposefully looking. It would be so easy for someone to slip in with the 100s of students coming and going everyday. This also requires the Floo to be connected to muggle homes for extended periods of time and someone can slip into their homes, be it accidentally (potential breach of the statute) or on purpose. First time users could get lost.

Portkeys tend to be any old piece of junk that a muggle could pick up. Another potential breach.

** Reply to 2 = Accidental magic. The untrained wizards and witches have a tendency to let magic go wild when not given an outlet, and keeping all of the young ones in an isolated place makes for a kind of release valve for that wayward magic. It was probably a concession to the families that the students are allowed home at all once their education begins, but they arrange for exams right before these breaks to make sure the students are 'magically exhausted' for their brief time away from the school.

** Honestly I think your first question can be answered simply: sloppy writing. The books are wonderfully flawed pieces of fiction, but JKR is notorious for writing herself into plot holes by introducing new magic basically each year.

Floo powder wasn't in the books until book two, so it “didn't exist” during book one. It's a similar problem to the book three issues. Since Veritiserum doesn't exist until book four, no one uses it on the prison escapee who never got a trial, because it “didn't exist” yet. The Fidelious Charm isn't introduced until book three, so of course it wasn't used as the final defense of the philosophers stone/Voldemort trap. There's a ton more examples of things like this in basically every book.

A lot of what this boils down to is that JKR decided to use a hard magic system, but didn't define its limits even to herself, which lead to her making things up as she needed them to progress the plot.

To your second question, it was so Harry could have a home away from the wicked step-family trope.

If you're looking for an in universe reason as to why they don't floo everyone there and back, and why it's a boarding school, I'd say it probably most has to deal with the Statute of Secrecy and Muggleborns. As muggles grew more and more adept at keeping track of where people are, it would become impossible to hide the fact that a chunk of 11-17 year olds somehow vanish off to school and back without any trace of how they got there or back. If it was happening on a daily basis it would be even worse. Furthermore, at the time of the books the majority of pure bloods hold muggles in varying levels of contempt (from Arthur's patronizing view to Death Eaters' “they aren't even human” attitude), so likely want to separate Muggleborns from their parents “for their own good” as much as possible.

** 1) The Train was designed by a Time Traveller from the year 2022. This time travelers was a muggleborn whi particularly like Thomas the Tank Engine.

2) Hogwarts was originally supposed to be a fort for King John at that time, when the Magna Carta was signed the 4 wizards put a muggle charm around it and named it Hogwarts. They gave a school for all the children with magic to learn in, however in return discretion was advised. Because of this the Floo was not allowed and travel was only viable by train as the founders put a charm that you could only enter by train.

Years later in the kate 1800 this charm was lifted and those with the Headmasters permission could floo INTO HIS office, no where else.

That's my personal head cannon for world building!

** 1. Boarding school could be mandatory because of safety concerns. Learning and practicing magic could go wrong in so many weird ways.

When a kid messes up, do you want them at home in the kitchen, with their parents panicking and trying to reverse it with their half-remembered Acceptable charms NEWT (possibly making it worse), or do you want the kid physically near a charms expert at the top of his field and a hospital wing set up just for this?

The other safety issue could be social growth. Mind-altering potions, charms, etc are unfortunate and inescapable. So sure, a kid could get dosed, come home, and their parents might recognize and fix it, which is great in the short term. At boarding school, your friends/housemates/classmates take on this role. They all are around too see what that looks like and get it taken care of. Better to learn that in school than when older with potentially worse consequences.

** 1. Having all the students arrive at once drastically cuts down on the chaos of having hundreds on wizarding children arrive at school and being allowed to use magic for this first time in two months. It'd definitely make more sense for there to be multiple stops so that students don't have to all board in London, but . . . eh.

2. It's unfair for students who, for whatever reason, can't commute, especially ones with muggle families. It's arguable whether the fact that some students are unable means that nobody is allowed, but it's not an uncommon thing, in my experience, for schools to make decisions like that.

Plus, it's a massive security risk to have students flooing to and from school every day.

  I know JKR and numbers don't always get on well with each other, but one thing that left me ever-so-slightly flabbergasted was the Weasleys' departure, together with Harry and Hermione, from the Burrow to King's Cross after the Quidditch World Cup. One-shot. Complete.

** There are no sensible in-universe explanations. The only reason is that Rowling didn't bother to imagine what kind of social, political, economical, cultural, logistical etc. ramifications the use of magic would have. She created a magical world that is mainly a magical version of the world she lives in. Since Harry Potter is a series for children, that is probably a good decision. I don't think it would have become popular if the books were full of analysis about how the lack of logistical limitations affects the magical society. Luckily we have fanfictions that can explore things like these.
