  The standard counter-Charm for a boggart is, of course, Fiendfyre.
#+end_quote

Edit: That one was actually from HPMOR. Although Seventh Horcrux deserves it more.

  Ah, Severus, my most loyal servant. It was good to see that, even a decade after my disappearance, he continued to attack my enemies. I suspected this would negatively impact my Potions grade, since I currently was one of my enemies. Nevertheless, his devotion was admirable.

  ...

  "There is no difference. Would you like to hear its third name?" "Fifty points for your cheek!" Severus roared. That year, I was determined to singlehandedly win the House Cup. For Slytherin.
#+end_quote

Continuing to prove that Seventh Horcrux is the best fanfic to ever exist.

*** So, Seventh Horcrux has been on my list of stories to read for a while, and I never got around to it til I read this quote and knew I needed to immediately. So I read it and loved it. Instead of sleeping last night. Totally worth it. Top ten fanfic of all time for me. Thank you.

It doesn't always make sense, but I just like to squeeze it in whenever I get a chance to anyway.

** Harry Potter and the Natural 20 has a few good ones. This one sticks out to me as the absolute worst yet hilarious analogy of all time:

#+begin_quote
  If the collective amount of surprise felt by the assembled professors were expressed in terms of, say, water, using the baseline of one fair-sized pink plastic beach bucket full of seawater representing the surprise felt when a politician suggests something sensible in Parliament and a bathtub full of water representing the theoretical surprise not felt when the idea doesn't get ridiculed by the opposing party, then their earlier surprise (when they heard of the unicorn attacks) could be collected in a two-litre bottle of Diet Coke (once said Diet Coke has been safely disposed of alongside other toxic chemicals) while their current surprise, caused by hearing that Quirrell had volunteered for something dangerous, was almost, but not quite, the size of the Mediterranean Sea.

  Rabastian sneezed. Bellatrix set him on fire.

  His question went unanswered as Bellatrix blew his head off

  Forgive me, Mr. Potter, my Inner Monologue appears to be broken. Do try to forget everything you've just heard.

  It's too hard to hear you over all the ominous Gregorian Chanting!

  Hey, wouldn't it be cool if someone took as many fanfic cliches as possible and stuffed them all into one story? No? Well, I went ahead and did it anyway. Multi-chapter Mockfic. This summary is actually a lot better than I originally thought.
