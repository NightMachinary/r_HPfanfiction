  Potter was going to say that he wasn't my boyfriend. I couldn't let him do that. For the love of Merlin, I could not let him do that. I had to stop him. He couldn't tell her the truth. So I did the only conceivable thing I could think of. I kissed him.

** Some of the most famous are The Life and Times and Commentarius. Unfortunately, neither is finished and both are on hiatus. I also really like Not Fade Away by Slide (JustSlide) on ao3.

  "I think you're an arrogant, selfish pig, and I think you'd be doing both of us a favor if you just left me alone!" Potter stared at me for a moment, an unreadable expression in his hazel eyes, before uttering a single word: "Okay." J/L, Lily's POV.

** I was recently rereading a fic that I wrote and it could be considered as kind of a prequel to a James/Lily relationship. There are a few grammatical errors that I noticed when I reread it but can't fix them at the moment, I'm still super proud of it though. I'd love feedback if anybody has any! Linkffn(12485818)
