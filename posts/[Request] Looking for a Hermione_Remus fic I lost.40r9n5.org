Someone cleaned out my bookmarks while undoing all my history and cookies while tidying my computer for me, and I still can't find a particular fic. Since this worked wonders last time, I'm trying it again!

It's Hermione/Remus, but starts out with Tonks and Ginny trying to dose Remus and Harry with potions in their drinks, but it ends up with Remus and Hermione shagging. Hermione, though, starts feeling Remus's transformations without him knowing. They try to stay friends as the Order is working on tracking down a new threat, but Remus keeps getting angry with her. They end up going undercover together where they discover that Tonks laced Hermione's hair dye with something to make Remus angry when he's around her over the assignment and they eventually work things out.

Help?


** Since this is a fairly small ship (and this looks to be one of the few fics in the ship I haven't read!), do you remember which site it was on and if it was complete?

*** I hope you can, I've been searching and I just can't seem to find the right words to find it by searching! It's driving me mental.

I was wrong, it's on granger enchanted. You have to have an account to read it.

Let me know if this is the right one?
