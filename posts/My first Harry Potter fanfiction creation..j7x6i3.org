[This is a Crack-Fic, don't take seriously]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13715801/1/How-Voldemort-s-Reign-of-Terror-Ended]]

This is something that I had running through my mind thanks to something I found on Twitter, and I decided to tough it out and try to write it. It is my first time writing anything Harry Potter related - that is not a prompt/challenge/request.

Let me know on what you thought about this parody/crack-fic One-Shot. I will also like a little feedback, if you can be so kind for it.


** /snicker/ okay that was a good fic. Any chance you could write another fic/chapter showing his followers reactions to him being bested by a baby gate? üòÇ

Edit: so the only issue I really noticed was some grammar mistakes. Most common was you using ‚Äòquiet' when you meant ‚Äòquite', saw that 3 or 4 times. Otherwise I think you wrote the story quite well with a good amount of detail. You could probably give a bit more description to certain things but overall you did great üëç

*** Ah, thank you! I am glad that you found that funny.

Sorry for the grammar errors or simple typos, some of the smaller things always escape and manage to sneak their way through.

I will see what I can do when it comes to the follow up chapter. If you could perhaps give me a simple idea on how that comes about that would be appreciated.

**** Hmm... one of his followers (Malfoy?) hears the whispered end of a convo in the ministry about the attack, does a little digging, then brings news back to dark headquarters and is so baffled by what they heard they ask advice from some other death eater without privacy charms, resulting in the spread of news to others.

Hope that helps! üòò
