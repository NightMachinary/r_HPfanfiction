Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash. Asexual/Bisexual, etc. Doesn't have to be focused on pairings

NO Weasley Bashing, as I love that family

Anyone can be the MC/Any Site/Any Length/Old or New

  'The Matchmaker' is a serial abductor whose modus operandi consists of pairing two same-sex individuals together in a coffin, six feet underground - buried alive. He isn't a killer. He's a kidnapper with morals, and Detective Chief Inspector Tom Riddle finds himself obsessed with solving the case.Unfortunately for Tom, the Matchmaker is just as intent on knowing him.

** linkffn(11815544;12778140) by Floreat Castellum are two excellent mystery stories. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] has several stories in the genre too. Check out the ones marked "MIT" in the list on his user page, but I seem to recall others have similar elements too.

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon... Winner of Mugglenet's Quicksilver Quill Awards 2016, Best Post-Hogwarts.

  When a mysterious woman comes to the Auror office claiming to be the victim of a terrible crime, Theia and Harry want to do everything they can to help her. The problem is, she has no memory of what has happened. As they piece together the sinister events, their own troubles and traumas rise to the surface, causing them to question who they really are. Sequel to The Aurors.
