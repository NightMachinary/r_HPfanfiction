I don't really like what Rowling did with the US in the movies and was wondering if there's any stories set in America that doesn't utilize what's put forth in the Fantasic Beasts movie franchise.

Any type of fic is fine really as long as it's not super dark and edgy.


** Alexandria Quick's series is basically a fully developed America that was written before Fantastic beasts and is it's own think. linkffn(3964606)

What Happens in Vegas is a Teen Titans Crossover that talks a bit about Magical America linkffn(10561760)

Harry Mcgonagall also has Harry growing up in a different magical america linkffn(3160475)

California Dreamin has Harry and Ginny move to San Francisco so Harry can teach DADA at a california school linkffn(12769629)

Breakfast in New York mentions magical america a little bit linkffn(5141159)

Running and Hiding also has a different magical america as far as i can tell linkffn(13165803)

Gothic has him and Ginny go to i believe Louisiana and interact with some Voodo Gods at one point in the fic linkffn(11922116)

** - There's the /Alexandra Quick/ series, by Inverarity, starting with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra_Quick_and_the_Thorn_Circle][/Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle/]] is a long running series. I personally don't care for it, though, as most of the characters aren't very likeable. It's supposed to take place in the same world as /Harry Potter/ but it's largely disconnected from it. It /is/ darker and edgier than the mainline /Harry Potter/ series, but I'm not exactly sure what qualifies as "super dark and edgy" to you. It is, however, a long running series of novel-length fanfics, with 5 of the 7 planned fics having been released.

On that note, apparently that same fanfic author founded a community for fanfics taking place in America in the Wizarding World, called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/America-in-the-Potterverse/55015/][America in the Potterverse]]

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7833937/chapters/17883658][Rise Above]] doesn't necessarily deal much with ~magical~ America, but it's still a really fun, lighthearted tale of the Golden Trio fucking off halfway around the world because they're fifteen, they don't feel like fighting a war and one of them is inexhaustibly rich.
