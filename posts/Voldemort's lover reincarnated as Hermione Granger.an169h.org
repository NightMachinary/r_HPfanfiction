I can't remember seeing one, maybe anyone had something like that in mind?

Me myself had an idea about Hilda Greengrass whom was a lover/wife of Dark Lord but she was killed during the war. Dark Lord himself was a more sane before her death and then he snapped and become an unstable person we all know. But Hilda tied her soul to the pendant which ended in possession of Hermione because she is a child of Greengrass squib and brother of the latter. Squib then married Granger muggle and with help of her brother concealed sensitive information about her pregnancy. And when Hermione got a letter from Hogwarts - she also recieved a ring with Hilda's memories and with slow proccess of its recovery she gets herself into Slytherin.
