:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a fic I found ages ago. I can't remember much about it other than Harry was at Durmstrang, his parents were alive and didn't know Harry was, and they meet during the Triwizard Tournament (I think). Harry had some sort of interaction with the Norse fate goddesses.

It's driving me nuts that I can't find it again!

  "Grim is the doom of norns." When a young boy from Durmstrang is found to be their son, the Potters are not the only ones convinced of miracles, but darkness treads on his heels and no matter who he comes to love, or who loves him, his Fate is decided. Slash/gore HPDM

There is currently another bot called [[/u/kzreminderbot][u/kzreminderbot]] that is duplicating the functionality of this bot. Since it replies to the same RemindMe! trigger phrase, you may receive a second message from it with the same reminder.

** Maybe one of these? It's been so long I don't remember if there's a goddess in these but I know the potters are alive and Harry's gone to Durmstrang. What's the pairing? That may help me I've read a ton of Harry goes to Durmstrang.
