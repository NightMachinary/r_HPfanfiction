:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey all, I'm looking for a fanfic that I've read before. Harry has joined Voldemort, I think from Voldemort rescuing him from the Dursley's. Harry has hidden his intelligence somewhat and has created a few potions in a journal/diary that he has, (hidden at the Dursleys, which he goes to collect) one potion that is a much stronger type of nutrient potion and the other helps to reduce the effects of dementors from azkaban. He gives these recipes to the death eaters and he becomes good friends with Barty Crouch jn. I can't remember if its slash with voldemort or not.

  Harry's world ends at the hands of those he'd once fought to save. An adult-Harry goes back to his younger self fic. Semi-super!Harry, Voldemort/Harry, SLASH-for the idiots
