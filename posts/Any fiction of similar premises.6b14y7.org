In one world Lily defeated Voldemort years after Her husband and son were killed. In another world James defeated Voldemort years after his wife and son were killed.

These two somehow ended up in canon/semi-canon like world at the same time where only Harry survived.

Kinda similar to latest chapter of this collection: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11642988/12][The Boneyard]]

Edit: Copying the plot premises by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/1298529/][Clell65619]]

#+begin_quote
  So, that got me to thinking. What if each of the Potters became the X "who lived"? Each in their own world.

  James gathered Sirius and Remus to him, and together used their pull with the Wizengamot to get him a hunting license with no bag limit.

  Lily found an ally in Alice Longbottom, the only survivor of her family's slaughter. Being a 'Muggleborn' Lily was celebrated but not taken seriously, and again the bulk of the Death Eaters found acquittal via claims of Imperius.

  Lily pulled her group together and became a criminal organization after Tom managed a rebirth via the Triwizard.

  So, after the battles are over, James is flailing about without a purpose to his life. In desperation Sirius and Remus find a way that might allow James to transition to a world where Lily and Harry are.

  Lily and Alice are arrested and sentenced to the Veil.

  I planned for James and Lilly & Alice to end up appearing a few weeks apart in a semi-canon world to find a desperate 15 year old Harry and co on their way into the Ministry to 'save' Sirius.

  Who doesn't believe for a second that these people are his parents, and Neville freaks right the hell out over an aware Alice.

Any fiction based on similar premises? Can you share idea how to exploit this premise if James and Lily ended up in Harry's world in different period (during 1981/after Sirius escaped/after GoP/during OotP etc)?

James, Lily, and Alice were ruthless and super powerful killers in their respective dimensions. Canon Voldemort would have little chance. A more interesting challenge might involve taking over this magical Britain.

******* Reflected killing curse? Reflected by what? A disarming spell?

Wands don't work that way. Wands don't know the spell that are casted from it, not the target. It either works or doesn't when a wizard uses it.

Since Voldemort was able to cast killing curse it means it worked for him.

The only thing that reflected it was 'disarming spell'.

******** Firstly, you're applying the principles of normal wands to the Elder Wand. We have significant evidence that the Elder Wand is unlike any normal wand. We already know wands are semi-sentient; we know the Elder Wand is more sentient than a normal wand.

Secondly, Harry Potter was, at that moment, the Master of Death. Whether or not collecting all three of the Deathly Hallows actually had any part in it is unknown, but it's still a point to be noted.

In any case, if I could understand the logic at the age of 10, then I'm not entirely sure what the problem is. Harry is the true owner of the Elder Wand. Voldemort tries to kill Harry with the Elder Wand. Harry's Disarming spell is basically negligible - with or without it, the end result would be the same. The Elder Wand will not kill its own owner, and the spell reflects and hits Voldemort.

********* Harry became elder wand's owner because he disarmed Draco's normal one? That's laughable.

Elder Wand belongs to one who is carrying it at the moment. It's ownership isn't defined by normal means. A normal wand has to be disarmed, and even then it doesn't change it's ownership completely.

Elder Wand changes it's owner by any mean. Theft, murder, disarm etc. It faithfully answers call of anyone who is holding it at the moment spell cast.

It shot AK toward HP, and it was a powerful AK. But then HP pulls another one of those absurd plot armors and shoots an 'expelliarmus' that fights with AK.

Elder Wand never has a true owner. It serves anyone who is holding it, regardless of means with which he acquired it.

No, that's canon. It fits exactly with what little we know about wand allegiances. If that's the part that you find unbelievable in the entire magical world, I'm afraid that is your problem.

Just because people /have/ killed the past owners of the Elder Wand doesn't necessarily mean it has to be passed down by killing. To begin with, it's probably a better indicator of the kind of person who hunted down the Elder Wand. If anything, Draco's case might well have been the first time the true master of the elder wand wasn't its wielder- which is down to Dumbledore being probably the most benevolent owner of said Wand.

Again, this is canon. My 10 year old self understood most of this perfectly fine. There are plenty of plotholes in HP, but this isn't one.

*********** Ah! The typical quote one thing and leave everything behind. it's laughable because other it doesn't match with how rules were established in canon.

Normal wands didn't change loyalty after 'disarm'. Why should Elder Wand change it's loyalty with disarm when it wasn't even directly disarmed.

Draco disarmed Albus, Snape killed Albus. Harry disarmed Draco's normal wand. Normal wand doesn't change loyalty after disarm. How does HP become owner when he didn't even disarm EW from Draco?

--------------

My 2nd point was: Elder wand serves anyone who carries it, regardless of how he came to acquire it. you and I agree that death of previous owner isn't required for loyalty of EW.

So if Voldemort is carrying EW it means that he defeated every potential EW owners and acquired it. Thus he had loyalty of EW. EW served his call by shooting an AK at HP. HP knew he would die, that's why he shot 'expelliarmus'.

And the most terrifying and powerful wizard dies because 'prophecised' child shot a 'disarming spell' at him.

That's the problem with 'prophecy child' trope and cliche fantasy stories. They always win!

************ The Normal wand does Change Loyalties as that's what Harry uses during the entire final battle, infact we have Olivander state that Harry Won it's Allegiance as a fact. You lost that point from the start. You also lose on the fact that a single Disarm can't change the allegiance of a wand.

You also failed at properly reading source material as Voldemort even states that the wand doesn't work properly for him so your whole "EW works on Who holds it" fails the EW not working properly is the grounds on which Voldemort had for Killing Snape! So to ignore the EW's qurks like you have, you leave no reason for Voldmort to Kill Snape

You Argument fails

************* Ad hominem?

Defeat how? By disarm spell? The disarm spell taht was casted agaisnt normal wand of Draco. The same normal wand that doesn't change loyalty after disarm spell?

Remember those training sessions in 'Room of Requirement'. Everyone was disarming each other. None of the wand change loyalty.

How is it that EW change loyalty even when Draco wasn't carrying it? The defeat that's meaningless against a normal wand which doesn't care about anyone disarming it's true owner.

Linking a free spirited wand's loyalty to loyalty of of a wand that never changes it's loyalty and then claiming that EW became HP's property because HP disarmed Draco's normal wand.

Not to mention the fact that since Voldemort is carrying that wand he beat HP in race to acquire and use EW. EW even shot a killing curse against it's own 'supposed' owner.

I know 10 year old you 'accepted' things without questioning them. But Mature you don't have to adhere to concepts that your 10 year old couldn't puncture through. Normal people do tend to become more intelligent than their 10 year old self.

**** True. Might be interesting to kill of Voldemort (or so they assume) in the first chapter and instead focus on James, Lily and Harry trying to become a sort-of functional family.

Wouldn't be sunshine and daisies as each would have to come to terms with what the others have done and become in their individual universes.

Meanwhile you could have Dumbledore stressing himself out on how to deal with the scar-horcrux. After all, how would two magically powerful but emotionally unstable parents react to reuniting with their son only to find out he has to die (again) to permanently deal with Voldemort.

****** Psychology would rather be burning question. I don't see James or Lily forgiving Albus so easily as he left Harry to Petunia's door or didn't do enough to rescue Sirius in 1981. And by no means, I think they would forgive Snape. Especially after his abuse towards Harry and Neville and causing their death in naive universe. Snape's proclaimed love for Lily would go out of the window in a single moment.

Considering they appear in canon world during OotP, Questions will be how three of them cope with themselves. A lots of dynamism possible.

******* That would be my focus of this story. The three might decide to overthrow the existing Wizarding establishment after neutralizing Voldemort.

With things getting very different after the DoM battle, Dumbledore most likely would not have been hurt by the Ring horcrux, so he would be their primary target after Voldemort.

But there had to be disagreements between Harry's gang and the Three. Maybe Harry and Neville had to get rid of their mad 'parents' after all.
