** To everyone's surprise, Binns decided moved on soon after the beginning of the school year, stating that he received a sign from above in the form of a Grim, a death omen. Dumbledore delivered a short but heartfelt eulogy before breakfast, and Myrtle spent the day in her toilet wailing that she was next, but other than that, Binns's departure went without much fanfare. The following day, Harry, Ron and Hermione found themselves in the History classroom, curious to meet the new Professor, a redheaded woman with dreamy eyes faintly reminiscent of a second-year Ravenclaw Ron's sister was friends with.

“My name is Professor Philomena Cunk,” she started. “This year, we will learn about the history of the magic in the British Isles, from the ancient druids, Merlin and the Founders to key figures of our generation such as Sirius Black and his alter ego, Stubby Boardman.”

Harry perked up. He wanted to know more about Sirius Black, but everybody avoided talking about him. At Harry's side, Hermione frowned.

“The druids were the first wizards in Britain besides Ollivader, whose shop stood there on Diagon Alley long before Diagon Alley came into existence,” Professor Cunk continued with her lecture. “But Ollivander refused to sell wands to the druids, so they had to resort to creating enormous stone rings to do magic, such as Stonehenge.

“Then the Founders came to Scotland to create Hogwarts. They first wanted to settle down in Ireland, but Salazar Slytherin had an altercation with a wizard named Patrick who kicked him and his pet out of the country. So they travelled around until they came across this castle, which looked just like it does today, only without any portraits, library or a Quidditch pitch. To relieve boredom, Rowena Ravenclaw charmed the ceiling to show the sky or, with a special spell lost to the time, Gryffindor's private chambers.

“Oh! I see Professor Snape walking down the corridor. Let's invite him and ask a couple of questions about the Founder of his House.

“Professor Snape, why was Rowena called Ravenclaw, but her mascot was an eagle? And was the vulture on your hat during your yesterday's Defence class a tribute to the bird motif of your house?

“As you can see from the way Professor Snape stormed off, Ravenclaws fiercely protect their secrets. This will forever remain yet another mystery, like where do vanished thing go or what is it with Dumbledore's fashion sense.”

**** Thanks. Philomena would fit into HP universe perfectly, she's even got the name for it. This is now officially my headcanon that she's a pureblood witch who's just clueless about Muggles.
