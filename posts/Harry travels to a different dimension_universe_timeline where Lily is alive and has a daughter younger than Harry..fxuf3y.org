:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Maybe a year ago I read a really long one-shot(50k words long) where Harry is extremely powerful and he uses that power to travel to a different dimension/universe/timeline where Lily is alive and has a daughter I believe was named Athena. In this alternative dimension/universe/timeline muggleborns and halfbloods lack many rights like not being allowed to say no if a pureblood propose to them. The fic was a HP/HG. I can't find it on FanFiction.Net.

  Harry has won the war and lost everything he held near and dear. In desperation he gambles everything on a dimensional jump. HPHG Bad Weasleys good Dumbledore. Rated for language and implied sex
