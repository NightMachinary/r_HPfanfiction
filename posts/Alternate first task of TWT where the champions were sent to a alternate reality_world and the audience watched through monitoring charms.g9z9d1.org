*** I remember enjoying the random Skyrim x-over. Too bad it hasn't been updated since 2018. I'd like to see what they had planned for the rest of the TWT.

  Purebloods have always been obsessed with maintaining their bloodlines. What was this based on? What is the origin of these traditions? Or rather WHO? As always Harry finds himself in the oddest situations. But finding himself face to face with the Progenitor of Magic Itself? That's certainly not what he expected when he got out of bed in the morning.
