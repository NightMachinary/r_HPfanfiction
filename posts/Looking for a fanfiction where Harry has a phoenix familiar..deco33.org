I would really prefer some long stories if possible, thanks!


** He finds himself a phoenix in /Cartographer's Craft/ by Copperbadge. There's a bit more to it than that - accidental time travel mostly, as a sixteen year old Sirius Black ends up in Harry's time after the Marauder's Map vomits him up - but there is a phoenix happily chilling in Harry's house.

Bear in mind, this is a very old fic. I remember reading it as it was being written back in 2004-ish!
