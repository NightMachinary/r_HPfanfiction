I really do love these, and seem to have combed through all the tags for it, and worked past that craving, then BAM! Brain wants some ancient Harry. At one point I did read one where he(Harry) was with Leonardo da Vinci and the Mona Lisa was actually male, and saw it years later in a museum.

Just a note- please no Harry/Hermione

Other other unrelated note: does anyone else like it when he has wings? Or the master of death with wings? No? Just me?


** There's one with fem!Harry who gets trapped in Ancient Egypt and lives life back to present time. It's called A Long Journey Home

  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

** Does Orders of Magnitude has this? It has some ancient, immortal characters who take on mortal guises during specific periods in history, but I dunno if Harry is one of them. Anyway the book does have some ancient immortals and tries to play that with some depth. Whether it succeeds is up to you I guess.
