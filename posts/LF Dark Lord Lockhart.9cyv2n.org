#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

**** Lockhart is more "Dick Dastardly" than an evil overlord. He is, however, an extremely dangerous and competent wizard. He's just Disney Evil, not Dangerous Evil.

Edit: in fairness, Voldemort is also basically a Saturday morning cartoon villain as well.

***** I mean, there have been some really weird villains; he doesn't have to be â€˜ew, mudblood evil', he could be a Fashion Lord or something and force everyone to wear pocketless pants. I'd fight him if he banned pockets. Just as evil.

****** No, he has a pencil thin mustache, a goatee, and dresses in a black cloak with a crimson liner. Also, he twirls his mustache and has a posh accent and wears a bowler hat.

Clearly, very evil.

******* Theres stereotypical business villain like that too, I suppose. I think Dumbledore-esque robes (garish, weird patterns) would be more evil just by blinding everyone who looks at him... maybe thats how Dumbledore bashing got started; his taste was just that bad.

This has Voldemort-in-a-trenchcoat, in a way. The plot is that Harry's wrongfully sent to Azkaban when Ginny won't wake up after the Chamber of Secrets incident, he meets Sirius, they break out...

  A 'Harry goes to Azkaban' story. Convicted for releasing the Basilisk from the Chamber of Secrets, Harry is put into a cell next to the most feared wizard in the world, Sirius Black. AU 3rd year, canon pairings, no Deathly Hallows.

Dont know if this counts but ill post it anyway.

Its a cracky fic with barely any grip on normality and very loose rules. It might not be everyones cup of tea but i quite enjoyed it so far.

Lockhart doesnt specifically become a dark lord but he does become a wanted/infamous criminal (against his will). Its not a real focal point of the story but i immediately thought of it when i saw your post so here it goes

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.
