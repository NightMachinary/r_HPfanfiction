  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

*** That and I want it to feel scary. Fandom makes it a joke, and it was not that scary in canon.

** A Harry ginny soul bond fic I read a long time back but don't remember the name. It has this soul stone which connects Harry and ginny. They are not even aware that they are bonded but just subconsciously gravitate towards each. The fic opens in the future where Harry had died with ginny taken care of by Ron and Hermione. Anyone remember the name?
