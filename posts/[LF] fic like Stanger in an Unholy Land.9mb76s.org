I am looking for a fic like Stranger in an Unholy Land by serpent-sorcerer except the Harry is never replaced by a goody two shoes. With James and Lily still alive, and Harry having a sister. Harry defect and becomes powerful, and the dark lords right hand man. Doesn't have to be realistically written, but something that is written decently well.

*** This, while not exactly what I meant, is looking pretty good. I was looking for one where there isn't dimension travel, and you get to follow Harry as he becomes twisted and mad, also learning why with good conversations. This fic seems pretty good though!

**** If this is the fic I'm thinking of you learn a lot about the dark harry as the story progresses. Has a lot of flashbacks and stuff to tell the story. I recommend it, although it is not exactly what you were asking for
