I'm an author on FFN and I have several stories, one with over 1.5k reviews, and others with hundreds of reviews. But writing those stories make me feel incomplete for some reason. I just want to write something meaningful, something that readers will read and actually feel the emotions. My stories tend to have drama, romance, and some action however I'm a shitty author.

I have no doubt people only read my old stories due to the ideas and the drama because my writing isn't as good as it should be.

I want to reinvent myself as a new writer, someone who conveys emotions to readers. This brings me to a plot that I was thinking of writing about. This idea isn't new or unique but with your help I'm hoping to give it some twists and make it work!

We've all read the whole poor girl an rich guy romance. I want to bring something like that to the Harry Potter universe. Harry might not be your ideal rich guy but he is famous and somewhat popular (depending on the Hogwarts year). The problem I have is choosing the right girl to pair Harry with. In order to make this work the girl has to have a believable back story in which she goes through hardships in order to keep her family alive.

Then there needs to be a way for Harry to meet with her and somehow spark romance. Not some first glance shit but instead something that's very realistic. However, I don't want it to be some long drawn out courtship seen in "The Legacy".

Any help that you can provide would be appreciated. Any feedback on the plot would also be appreciated.

This doesn't strike me as particularly special or meaningful. It's been done a million times, in the fandom and out. It doesn't really fit Harry, either. He's more of an average bloke that's been thrust into extraordinary circumstances. Him being rich is more of a fanon fabrication, and depending on the year he's more infamous than famous. He has tons of baggage from everything he's been through as well; he doesn't really fit the role of the stable person that helps their partner deal with their shit.

Do you know what year/time period you want to set it in? It significantly affects what advice we can give.

*** I think fourth year because that's when new characters are introduced! I also think its one of the major climaxes in the series.

**** I'm not sure how long of a time period you'd want to cover, but keep in mind that most teen romances don't last, despite how prevalent fics are where fourteen year olds (or eleven year olds, gah) find twoo luv. It might be better to work on establishing a close friendship between them first with the potential for romance later.

How about Luna? She saw her mother die when she was nine. The loss of his wife drove her already eccentric father a bit mad, and her quirks developed as a way of maintaining a connection with the only parent she had left. (That last bit's my headcanon.) While at school she was bullied by her housemates and other students that didn't understand her.

***** I think the friends thing is a good idea. It means you don't have to create unnecessary conflict to fill time in the relationship.

It also will help create a solid foundation and character development for your girl outside of just girl-harry-will-end-up-with. IMO, I wouldn't start the story with her as a potential love interest at all. Start with the storyline of her settling into the trio and the problems that brings. If she joins the trio it would mean she has her own qualities that help the team, thus developing her as a more full character.

She could even start as Hermione's friend first before Harry gets to know her. This would also mean she could have story arcs not revolving around Harry (at the start) i.e. with Hermione. If something is going on with Harry (when is something not?) like him liking Cho or avoiding death again, it would make sense that he doesn't immediately see the new girl as a love interest.

As for who she is, you could make her one of the Gryffindor girls in Harry's year who inexplicably aren't introduced in canon.

I'm not sure how to set Harry up as the rich guy. I personally hate the noble house crap. I'd prefer his parents were just filthy rich and left him alot of money and he wasn't really aware of how much until 4th year.

** All I can offer is the notion that HP fanfiction is a big tent, room for all, and that means that there's going to be some wildly different ideas about what touches people's hearts. I've been told by people I respect that [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]] left them cold because it was over-the-top and melodramatic. I found it to be quite moving in some places. I read a thread discussing [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][A Long Journey Home]] with several people claiming the writing fell flat. I found the writing to be lovely, and several sections (later parts of the Merlin arc, and the chapter set in the 1960's with Dumbledore) I consider to be among the best-written I've seen in faniction.

Opinions are divergent enough even with mostly codified notions, like what constitutes acceptable and good writing in long-form fiction, that when it comes to something as personal as what moves you, you're really SOL trying to crowdsource it. Just write what you like. What moves /you/. If you do it truly, chances are there's a group of people out there who'll like it.

** Don't fall into the pit of assuming completely original is somehow better. Often it fails miserably and you'll have wasted a fair amount of time trying to reinvent the wheel.

Perhaps you could try something of an episodic nature? Like having one fic devoted to a particular team (I.e. Unspeakables) and each chapter is the same characters dealing with different problems. I'd write it myself but I'm trying to teach myself how to write the bare basics of writing as it is.

There's a lot of room in this genre (it's very niche right now). And you can blow this niche right into popular fanfic culture if you do it right. With episodic things too, it is much easier to contain the story and plot it out. You can have specific chapters like different arcs in a story and have one-shots as a chapter. There's really a ton of wiggle room. Really easy to get character development down in this form too - as you can contain the characters within the stories and provide backstory as you go to round them out into fully personalized people.

Good luck :D

** Any plot can be made memorable if written correctly or if it has good characterization or the conflict is good and believable.

Personaly If I where you i would go for Ginny, (I know most people don't like her but hear me) she meets your criteria of poor girl/rich boy without bending canon too much, she wasn't really developed much in canon or as much as Hermione, so you have a little space to experiment without needing to create a completly new OC, she has some interesting character traits: Strong Willed, Tomboyish, implied character development and some characters flaws you can work with for your own character development.

Then i would give Ginny an objetive that is not "to get into Harry's pants" in canon it was becoming a profesional quiditch player for example.

*** Ginny is the normal route to go but it sucks that Harry already knows her family. I was thinking of maybe an OC or a character people don't know much about.

Maybe Lisa Turpin? Raised by a single mother and forced to work in knockturn alley during her breaks. She would have knowledge of dark arts due to her upbringing and work place. She's Ravenclaw so she is at least approachable (not saying Slyhterins aren't but in the books I don't think Harry made any Slytherin friends :x)

** When you say poor girl, the first thing that comes to mind is Ginny. And when you say rich boy, Harry seems like a good fit. But the traditional stories require the rich boy to have been brought up rich, so Draco is more appropriate.

Both characters can be a bit fleshed out. Draco has some interests like potions or charms, a good noble upbringing, and plenty of know-how on the political side of things. Ginny can be more involved in keeping the family afloat financially, by helping around the house and doing small chores. Through some circumstance they are put together and learn about each other. Ginny learns that Draco actually has feelings and problems (no matter how much money he has) and Draco can learn just how much he takes for granted.

Just my two cents.

*** I'm sure some people out there would love reading Draco/Ginny but sadly I can only read Harry centric fics haha. I have this feeling the whole dark and rich Draco being tamed by poor Ginny Weasley has been done before :X

** Honestly, aside from Ginny/Hermione/Luna most of the girls don't really have a fleshed out back-story, so you have a lot of freedom if you were to take a name-only character like Hannah Abbott or a minor character like Lavender Brown. I like the idea of using Luna, a character who is known to be bullied. I can see Harry's personality work with someone who needs to be rescued rather than rich boy/poor girl plot. Harry asked Luna to Slughorn's party as friends to make her happy, I can easily see him doing the same for someone with Yule Ball. Example, Harry befriends Hannah Abbott during Herbology and later discovers she is upset that no one has asked her to the Yule Ball. Harry asks her, but phrases it so it sounds like Hannah's doing him a big favour cause he'll look stupid without a date.

** Write something unique. A new concept is hard. A new pairing is impossible. So take an existing plotline or pairing and turn it sideways. A couple days ago I asked for fics were Harry met Hermione before anyone else.

I was shocked to find it basically doesn't exist. I found 3 fics, none longer than 30K words. Its a concept with huge potential, could be longer than the original series if someone had the time.

Not saying you should write about that, but do select something that you would want to read.
