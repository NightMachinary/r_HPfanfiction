One of the major strengths of the original Harry Potter series, in my opinion, was the sense of wonder that pervaded much of the story, with the way that JKR was constantly introducing new magical spells and gimmicks and devices. Too often I read fanfiction, and it just retreads the path that canon took - we don't see anything /new/, just permutations of magic that we've already seen before.

Is there any fanfiction that can reignite my sense of wonder, by showing me something new and interesting? Even tiny examples (like Comed-Tea from the early HPMOR chapters) are welcome.


** linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane) has a lot of new spells - powerful ones at that, and a Harry that wields them. Also features a great interpretation of Dumbledore.

For more recs I'd have to search a bit through my bookmarks. I can't really recall anything more from the top of my head.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome) has my single favorite ability in Wandsong: a synesthesia-like reaction to magic that includes a conversational relationship with your wand.

linkffn(The One He Feared by Taure) has the single best potion in the Draught of Notre Dame which allows the drinker to hear magic placed on an area in sounds that change based on listener, time, location and a myriad of other factors.

Even though two points don't make a trend, I definitely see a connection here.

linkffn(0-800 Rent-a-Hero), even though it has shady author shit, does a lot of cool divination stuff.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forest of Valbone) has the coolest way of learning/making new spells ever, plus my favorite enchanting process plus a bit of cool herbology/ritual blend stuff. Actually, just look at all of enembee's stuff.

linkffn(Lesser Evils by ScottPress) does interesting things with dark magic, though I disagree with one of its core assertions.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lightning Scar), while being the weakest fic I'm referencing here, does a lot of fun stuff with other magical traditions.

linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar by Steelbadger) has what I believe is the best exploration of potioneering due to the necessiity of having to create everything without recipes and is also exploring wandmaking.

Hope this helps.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.
