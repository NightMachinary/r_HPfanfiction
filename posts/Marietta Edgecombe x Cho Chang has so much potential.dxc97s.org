Ever since I read OotP for the first time, I've shipped this pairing. I've never really read any fic for it though, because not much exist. It's one of the only female relationships with canon backing and both Cho & Marietta are complex characters even within the text.

Was Cho dating Harry to get over both Cedric /and/ to pretend she wasn't into Marietta? Are her feelings affected by Marietta's betrayal? If it's a wartime fic, how they deal with graduating right at the start of Voldemort's regime? How does the Ravenclaw house deal with anything?

There's so much you could do with them. Someone do it please.


** I'm surprised I never thought about this pairing considering I must've gone through, what felt like, every single wlw pairing ever back in the day ðŸ˜‚

Thank you for pointing out a really interesting pairing to consider!!

*** Female relationships include friendships lol. There are only 3 canon female friendships other than Ginny and Hermione.
