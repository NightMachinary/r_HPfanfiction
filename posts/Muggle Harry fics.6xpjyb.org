Any fics where Harry lives as a muggle and want nothing to do with wizarding world. The only fics I don't want are ones where Harry is already a part of the wizarding world and decides to leave. Wbwl and neglect fics welcomed.


** Non-magical AUs:

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is a 660k words long Canon rewrite and one of the very few fanfics I enjoyed more than the original.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8941561][half awake and almost there]] is a beautiful Harry and Ginny romance.

--------------

Harry doesn't care about the magical world:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11994595/1/][Perfectly Normal, Thank you very much]], linkffn(11994595): the Dursleys treated Harry so well that he didn't see the need to risk his neck for Magical Britain. Others were forced to pick up the slack.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12212363/1/][Harry Potter and the Iron Lady]], linkffn(12212363): Harry loved his adopted family so much that he refused to be called a 'Potter'.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): James and Lily got in a lucky shot on Voldemort, ran away, and raised Harry in Muggle world. That Harry though, was very ambitious and intelligent.

  Even muggles notice thousands dead, and Margaret Thatcher had the help of one Sergeant Prewett of Her Majesty's Special Air Service. Harry Potter is taken in by a loving family, and raised to become the hero of both worlds. Even as he enters Hogwarts looking for friends, he is confronted by the darkness in the wizarding world. First year complete, second year starting April 2017.

**** No, it's chronologically the first in the series.

Its sequel [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-28614/DianeCastle+The+Secret+Return+of+Alex+Mack.htm#pt][The Secret Return of Alex Mack]] is a lot fun to read, too. The end of "HG & BWL" immediately leads to Hermione and Alex Mack's meeting in Berlin.

#+begin_quote
  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

  Complete. Draco Malfoy lives the life of a criminal. He is cold and distant from the world. Harry Potter is a dancer and a bit of a daydreamer. Complete opposites, right? But what really lies behind these masks? A chance meeting and their worlds are changed. Slash.
