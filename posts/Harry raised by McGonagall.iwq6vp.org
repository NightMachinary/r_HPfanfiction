:END:
I remember reading this fic a while ago, but can't find it again. It's a multi book series and has McGonagall taking Harry in from the Dursley's and raising him (with Remus I think?), Harry and Draco meet in a park and they become friends. Narcissa goes behind Lucius' back to let them hang out, and I think eventually seeks “asylum” with Sirius? Thanks


** Might be Harry McGonagall
