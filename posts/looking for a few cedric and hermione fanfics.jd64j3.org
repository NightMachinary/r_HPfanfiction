:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
1. i remember that cedric and hermione start off as friends and this fic is based around triwizard tournament time. cedric saves hermione instead of cho from the lake, and reasons that was he didn't see her. i think krum ends up saving cho instead. for the yule ball, cedric ends up going with cho because krum had beat him to asking out hermione, pretty he asked her in the library and there's a part about him lurking around the library a lot bc he's taken a liking towards her. cedric is annoyed at this and hermione just doesn't like the noise krum's fangirls cause by following him to the library.

2. hermione gets a love letter from one of cedrics friends (was an oc), they become friends and she hangs out with their hufflepuff group (also ravenclaw?) at hogsmeade and stuff, one time she travels on a carriage with them too i think. im pretty sure at first hermione and credit hate each other and get into a big fight in the great hall. in the end cedric ends up with her though.

3. cedric is a ghost and only hermione can see him, he's slowly fading away so he gets her attention by sending a love letter under his friends name. they work on an solution in the room of requirement which is like an elaborate potion and spell or something. this is set after cedric dies btw. i just remember a part when cedric meets his friend at the end again because hermione holds both their hands so they're connected.

sorry about how much text there is, i just wanted to provide the details. im pretty sure all these fics were from fanfic dot net, if you have any ideas what they are thanks! :)

  Hermione is in her fifth year. Like Harry and the other students, she can't forget what happened in the maze. But mostly, she's feeling guilty: she didn't help Diggory when he asked for it. Could bringing Cedric back to life be the perfect way to redeem herself?
