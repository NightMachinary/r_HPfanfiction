** Sadly, I never got to read the original before it was taken down, so I can't comment on any changes. However, I've enjoyed reading the new version, and I'm curious to see where the author takes the story after the seeming cliff-hanger ending it's at now.

Some aspects of the story (such as Harry's piano playing) felt a bit underdeveloped. It was a bit hard to buy Harry's sudden piano skills when there's been no flashbacks or character development before that scene to indicate music as an important part of his personality. Similarly, the depth of Voldemort's obsession with Harry didn't feel real to me, maybe because the dream scenes were too short to provide much character development between the two of them.

While reading, I couldn't help comparing the fic to ObsidianPen's other Harry/LV story which has a similar twisted relationship dynamic: "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7502151/chapters/17052891][No Glory]]". That fic spent many more chapters providing depth to the interaction between Harry and Voldemort, and I feel like it's a stronger story because of that.

But they are both excellent stories. I love all of ObsidianPen's fics that I've read, and I'll be eagerly watching for updates regardless of which fic she decides to focus on in the coming months.
