This is an odd request to be sure, but I'm really curious if any fics of this type even exist.

I see it a lot in Remus/Sirius stories, where one of them realizes they fancy their best mate, coming to terms with the fact that they're gay, being horrified about the other finding out etc etc.

But are there any stories like this with Harry? There doesn't even need to be any particular pairing, I'd just like to see the process of Harry coming into his sexuality. Maybe even a Harry/OMC? New student, inexplicably drawn to them etc?

  One good turn always deserves another. Apparently. Epilogue compliant/AU. HPDM slash but some canon het along the way. Please trust me - I promise the epilogue will not bite you.

  Jaffar lifts the automaton's chin and admires him as he used to admire his own mirror image as a youth, but this is so much better, so much more fulfilling than a mere reflection. It is because he is gazing upon an improved version of himself--yes, he has dared improve on God's creation, the piquant arousal only blasphemy can bring now curling up his spine, licking at his groin. He has taken the liberty of erasing a few wrinkles, of straightening the teeth a little, of making the doll's hair a little thicker, fuller: and what surprises Sarosh hides underneath his robes, oh--Yassamin shall find out soon enough.

  Pleased with himself, the image of himself, Jaffar chuckles, unable to resist the temptation of a kiss. Jaffar builds a silver replica of himself as a birthday present to Yassamin. But it would be foolish of him not to test the doll first, would it not? Only to make sure everything is in working order, of course.
