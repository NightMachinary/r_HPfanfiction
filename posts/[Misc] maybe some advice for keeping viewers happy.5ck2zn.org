** First, read a lot if you want to be good at writing.

Second, if you want to get people to read your story, write it carefully to make sure it is pleasant to read. Lets ignore high style for the moment. Read through your work and make sure that the sentences flow well, that it is easy to figure out what's going on, that the grammar and spelling are good, that what your characters say sounds like what real human beings might actually say to each other.

Third, write a lot of stories if you want to be good at writing. You will inevitably hit a point where you have developed enough taste to realize that what you're writing isn't good enough to please yourself but that you don't know enough to make it better. Power through that. Write more stories.

And lastly, if you're looking for actual tricks: unlike when people buy a novel in a store, the world of fanfiction is one where the reader is surrounded by choices, and the cost of abandoning a story in the first few paragraphs is low. So, try to make the start of your story really good and engrossing. Once they're drawn in, there is more chance that they'll stay.

** Update consistently, maybe post a snippet from the next chapter at the end of the current one to keep their interest, and if you reply to reviewers via PMs they get more invested in following your story.

For more specific advice, I would need to know more about the kind of story you like to write.

*** Personally, I hate when authors post snippets from the next chapter, or repeat the last part of the previous chapter as the first part of the next chapter. It gives me an annoying sense of deja vu, like I'm reading the wrong chapter.

A synopsis of the next chapter would be okay, but wouldn't heighten my appreciation of the story.

**** Plus, the repitions are really annoying for people who find the fic later and are reading multiple chapters in one sitting.

If people need to remind themselves what was happening, they know how to get to the previous chapter. Let them decide that for themselves.

** If the things you like are things that are popular (popular pairings and tropes etc), then you are almost certainly going to write popular stories yourself. If the stories you like don't get much attention then the probability is that yours won't either, but you should still write the things you want to read. It's always more comfortable to fit in with the crowd, but don't be afraid of individuality. Reviews are nice of course but plenty of us don't get many and it's not a big deal.

** Don't put in overly long A/Ns, a quick update here or there is ok but for over do it. Have an upload schedule and stick to it, if I'm following a fic that updates every Wednesday I'm gonna be happier with it than if it's updates are sporadic. Don't give away future plot points or anything in your A/Ns, there's nothing worse than being spoiled on for the fic by the author themselves.

I'm sure I've missed a ton but that's all I can think of at the moment.

**** If it's daily updates how long are your chapters? I'm not sure about the others here but I prefer around 5k - 10k words per chapter and I'd rather have that with less frequent updates than the alternative.

  While you shouldn't leave a cliffhanger every chapter, a resolution every time will also make the story a stilted read. Either extreme makes the story appear episodic.

  In depth world building is great when you don't have to wait a surplus of two to three months between chapter updates. Fiction is like algebra - even as you're building on prior knowledge, sometimes you need to reinforce it.

  Character development is always nice, but unless you plan from the start to deviate from the norm, be careful about making your story particularly AU and your characters OOC.

  Warn readers about the nature of relationships within the fic if they are integral to the plot.

  If these relationships are romantic and you want to appeal to a larger crowd (not just the ones who follow that pairing), make sure to vary the story's focus.

That's about all I can think of off the top of my head. Best of luck and happy writing! \o/

**** There is no such thing as unique. People have been recycling ideas since the first man copied other animals' hunting habits. I think when people strive to be unique rather than open, they're really just letting themselves into a pitfall of hopelessness.

If you can't be original (and you really can't), just try to be the best at your thing. Recycle as you please. What will set you apart is your agency and willingness to better your writing.

There are reasons many tropes do succeed, though, and going to the source of these reasons and branching from there rather than working from preestablished fandom cliches themselves might be helpful to your writing... and with appealing to the masses, as this thread suggests you'd like to do. Masses are hard. I commend you for it.
