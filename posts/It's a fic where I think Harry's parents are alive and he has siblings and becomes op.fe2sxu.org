So basically all I remember of this is that he goes to Durmstrang (I think he went to Hogwarts for like a month or 2) he ends up finding Grindlewalds vault in the school, he absorbs Grindlewalds magic, becomes op, absorbs some really powerful Greek wizards who'd proclaimed themselves as gods magics and just becomes like super op.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
