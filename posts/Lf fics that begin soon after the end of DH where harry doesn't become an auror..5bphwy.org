** Are you looking for stories where Harry has an alternative occupation? Because if your only requirement is that Harry doesn't become an Auror, a Master of Death fic would always work for you.

Other than that, if you're looking for laughs, look for no more than the master himself. This one /linkffn(3401052)/ never gets old at all. There is also his trilogy, which is fairly funny as well. /linkffn(2354771), linkffn(2477165) and linkffn(2630300)/
