This guy: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3136818/plums]]

I'm looking for either a place where he himself writes since I've seen him in the review section of ffn.net from time to time, meaning he's not dead, or a place where people continue his stories. A good example is Rotaryfile for the continuation of Last second savior even if the harem was way too big I still enjoyed it.

Other than that I'm looking for harem stories that are HP crossed over with either Star Wars or Warcraft with little or no HP girls, especially not Hermione or Ginny.

Thanks!


** From what I can tell, he basically just works with whats-her-name, the one who writes linkffn(I'm Still Here) and the vastly overrated linkffn(I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For).

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.
