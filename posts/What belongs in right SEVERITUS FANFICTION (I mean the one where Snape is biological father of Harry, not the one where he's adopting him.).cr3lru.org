Where is that apparent? To me it seems like sloppy writing to assume that Lily wouldn't have a social life outside of her relationship with James.

****** Rowling did a disservice to her female characters in general, in that she just didn't write female friendships. The story turns on male friendships (Harry/Ron, Marauders) and male-female platonic friendships (Harry/Hermione, Lily/Sev). But deep female friendships are glaringly absent. If Lily had best girlfriends in addition to Sev, we don't hear about them. We don't know if Molly or Tonks or Fleur had friends.

Then there's the constant undercurrent of disdain among the most prominent girls in the saga. Hermione/Ginny/Luna are nominally friends, but their connection appears to be circumstantial. Hermione and Ginny think Luna is nuts, and not in the affectionate way. There's no particular warmth between Ginny and Hermione either--- they laugh together a couple of times, but Ginny is very much barred from the Trio's inner circle and Hermione commits the twin sins (in Ginny-world) of not liking Quidditch and not liking pranks.

Two female friendships that feel real are Lavender/Parvati (Parvati comforting Lavender after her pet dies) and Cho/Marietta (Marietta sticking by Cho after Cedric's death). But the narrative is very unkind to them, as individuals and collectively. They giggle! They cry! How awful!

***** There's a war going on so she wouldn't have much of a social life. And canonically speaking the only friends mentioned are Snape and Sirius with Mary MacDonald being a possible.

** A good explanation for how that can happen. Example: After the mudblood incident, Lily asks Snape why and he says that he didn't mean it but needed to convince the other Slytherins that he's not a friend of a muggleborn or he'd be in serious danger. Lily forgives him and they secretly continue their friendship while acting in public like they hate each other. Snape acts as spy for Lily long before he spies for Dumbledore, which is how James and Lily manage to barely escape and defy Voldemort three times. Lily has a secret affair with Snape but can't tell James that she doesn't actually hate Snape and that it's just an act because she doesn't know how he'd react. Since all differences from canon are secret and only Lily and Snape know about it, the plot mostly continues like in canon with Pettigrew betraying the Potters, Harry growing up with the Dursleys stays the same. Until one day....

"If you only knew the power of the Dark Arts. Dumbledore never told you the truth about your father."

"He told me enough! You hated him!"

"No, I didn't hate your father... I am your father."

"No. No. That's not true. That's impossible!"

"Search your feelings, you know it to be true!"

"No! No!"

"Harry. You can destroy the Dark Lord. Trelawney has foreseen this. It is your destiny. Join me, and together we can rule the magical world as father and son. Come with me. It is the only way."

#+end_quote

If Lily has feelings for Snape why would she marry James and then carry on behind his back? This is a stumbling block for a lot of Severitus stories because the backstory hinges on Lily betraying the trust of the people she cares about in a completely reprehensible way.

To be honest I've only read a few Severitus fics, so I may have missed ones that handle the backstory better. Thus far I haven't read one that explains the past without turning into character assassination of Lily or fitting elements of non-con into the backstory.

**** My idea was that Snape and Lily would have to keep pretending to hate each other in order to not endanger Snape, but their secret friendship doesn't turn into a romantic affair until after Lily married James.

** I think a proper AU might be the best way and then there'd be the problem of how to keep Snape himself enough. I think it would be something like him needing to be a spy and hide everything and I would even like to think that James is good enough friend for Lily to keep her child safe for the time it takes to get rid of Voldemort. (I hate unfaithful Lily).

** IMO it is almost impossible (without rape or massive AUs) because Snape was a happy Death Eater until Lily was personally targeted for the child she had with another man. And Lily was their primary prey.

Snape covered for his shady friends back at Hogwarts. We never know what exactly happened there, but Lily was not amused by what they did to her friend while Snape was not concerned by it. He went for lethal force in "worst memory" (a few inches in another direction and that curse cuts James carotid artery). That is not a person I see Lily ending up with because she was already getting fed up with his behaviour before he called her a Mudblood. And that he'd use that word is another indicator why you cannot sell it in a close-to-canon setting. I mean, I call my friends motherfucking bastards and worse on a regular basis, but that is just friendly banter where you try to find the worst possible burn. But Snape was not bantering, he went for "most impact" with the intent to hurt (at least while he was still angry).

Massive AUs would be Snape not in Slytherin and shat on by the Death Eater wannabes, but that would shape him into a different character at which point you are basically writing Lily/OC whom you call Snape.

But that might be the only way you can pull it off convincingly. Snape in Ravenclaw, for some reason bullied by the purebloods and then deciding to fight fire with fire. That would keep the Marauders out and not give them much reason to get involved with Snape. And Snape had poor Judgement in canon, following Lupin while suspecting him a werewolf was completely on him (Sirius only showed him the way, Snape was the one who decided act on it).
