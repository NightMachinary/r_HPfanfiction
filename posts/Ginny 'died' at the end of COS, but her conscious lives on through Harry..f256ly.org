I don't mean that she can control him or anything, but that Harry can hear her voice in his head or something like that.

edit: I actually expected this to be something that had been done before. I can't believe no one has done this.


** If you wanna make it dark, you could make it a side effect of Harry's severe guilt over not getting there in time, and that its not really Ginny but actually Harry's psyche fracturing. At first "Ginny" blames him for her death and is snide and cruel, but as Harry begins to forgive himself through therapy "Ginny"'s voice softens and eventually forgives him before fading away

** And then, Ginny's consciousness encounters Tom once again thus waking him up.

** This would be so neat to explore and wholesome yes too! :) It would be like Yugi and Pharaoh from YUGIOH or also Oscar and Ozpin from RWBY. :) :) I love that dynamic in shows! Yes brain passengers!!! And brain passenger Ginny would get harsh disillusionment with her hero immediately upon return to Privet Drive after the Chamber, so that can have super interesting character stuff right off the bat if you wanted to! :) Plus then all the "criminal Sirius Black" angst stuff for third year after that too. Yes lots of possibilities to have fun with. Like maybe Ginny urges Harry to get to know Lupin better because she comes from a well adjusted family and can act like his "well adjusted conscience"! :) Or try to get him to report the Dursleys too, for that.
