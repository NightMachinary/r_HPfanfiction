So, what if one evening, when Dursleys were awful towards him, 8-year old Harry wished they disappeared? And magic got involved?

I think the magic of the blood protection won't recognize them as dead (they 'disappeared', not died), so as long as Harry thinks of the Privet Drive as home the protections should work.

Now Harry is thinking up ways to appease neighbors' suspicions (like in a movie when the boy tries to ward off thieves, but maybe with some accidental or wish magic involved) to show that the family is still here. Or maybe him discovering through post that they get monthly checks from his parents' vault for his upbringing and being able to hire a homeless person to act as his uncle/aunt that looks after him after Vernon got promoted to an Australian office, leaving with his wife and son.

How he bamboozles aunt Marge with fake phone voices.

How maybe that homeless person is not a muggle, too.

How Harry comes to Hogwarts so Slytherin there's no arguing with the hat.

But mainly Harry surviving in the muggle world without guardians and without being caught.

A bonus side-fic: Dursleys arriving in a different universe. The possibilities are endless, here, too. I feel like it would be fair to the 'laws of inter-dimensional travel' that they arrive in universes where they didn't exist before (or died). Maybe they proceed to have normal, boring lives. Unless at 13 Dudley receives a letter from Warthogs School of Magic Practitioners. Just saying. Or: arriving into a Voldemort-Wins universe, having to join underground rebels to survive. Arriving into a Muggles-Live-In-Peace-With-Magic universe, having to adapt that magic is like electricity or space travel. Joining an Anti-Magg movement that also believes that the Earth is flat and Big Mags are there to get you. Arriving in a Super-Hero universe. Maybe Dudley is bitten by a radioactive bed bug and turns into a vigilante...

Edit: a note about Harry rationalizing his relatives 'disappearing'. I don't think he'll need a lot as an 8-year-old who could turn his teacher's wig blue. Even a non-magical child (Kevin from the movie) didn't need much after he remembered his wish and thought he got his wish fulfilled.


** It would be funny also if said homeless person was one of the order, either Lupin or my personal favourite for this role: Mundungas Fletcher.

You can imagine him getting pulled in for what is effectively a job consisting of living in a nice house (given that Harry is mostly self sufficient by this point) with food and stuff paid for. Then he sortof warms up to Harry and...

Well, that's his character arc, and I'll leave it up to someone else to decide how Fletcher's character changes as he lives with Harry.

** I love this idea, maybe Harry mistakes Hagrid when he shows up with his hogwarts letter as the burglars and he tries to protect the house in the 3 seconds before Hagrid can break down the door with limited success. Then once he learns the truth he's like oops my bad maybe I overreacted a little mr Hagrid... I'm sure your beard will grow back in no time

** This sounds really fun. I imagine that Harry would have to learn a lot of grown-up stuff quickly, like paying bills, signing his own school reports, and eventually property taxes. He wouldn't know the Dursleys' pin numbers, but with a lot of practice he could figure out how to forge their signatures on letters and checks in order to do many things by mail, and copy the examples from their files. If he figured out how to make illusions or mess with people's minds, that would solve a lot of his problems. Then there is the problem of the nosy neighbors, particularly friends like the Polkisses and Mrs. Figg with her spy cats. Harry could make up an illness for one or more of the Dursleys to explain their sudden reclusivity. To make the story interesting, he would have multiple close calls. He should also definitely figure out how to do a few wandless spells, like Lily and Tom Riddle did.
