** I had to make another reply to rec. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][Princess of the Blacks]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4036441/Silently-Watches][Silently Watches]], who also wrote [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233288/1/Faery-Heroes][Faery Heroes]] and a couple other good ones. HOWEVER: Note that this story is */DARK/* and includes several [[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=squick][squicky]] themes and scenes including [[/spoiler][paedophilia]], [[/spoiler][a brothel with children age 4-14]], [[/spoiler][incest]], [[/spoiler][rape]], and [[/spoiler][torture]].

** Just search the [[http://scryer.darklordpotter.net][DLP Scryer]] for the word 'twin'. [[http://scryer.darklordpotter.net/?summary=twin&rating=k&rating=k%2B&rating=t&rating=m&characterRequired=1&characterOptionalExclude&characterOptional=777&characterOptional=6&characterOptional=2510&characterOptional=347&characterOptional=2195&characterOptional=1962&characterOptional=348&categoryOptionalExclude&language=English&sortBy=meta.reviews&orderBy=desc&search][When I looked]], I used these search terms:

#+begin_quote
  Summary: +twin\\
  Required Character: Harry P.\\
  Excluded Character: (pretty much all dark characters)\\
  Sort: Reviews
#+end_quote

also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2900438/1/Unsung-Hero][Link to Unsung Hero]] for those who haven't read it yet.

edit: I would add "-slash" to the Summary part, but then it also excludes the stories that say "NO SLASH" in the summary. which is lame. there's only like 50 of them that show up anyway so I guess it's not that big a deal.

** I'm convinced that /Unsung Hero/ has the worst ending in all of fanfiction. I remember following the story when it was updating and feeling utterly betrayed.

Some other stories along these lines (not all twins, but siblings):

Araceil's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5778267/1/Beyond-the-Pale][Beyond the Pale]] is one. 23k words, complete.

#+begin_quote
  Fourth year. Living with the Dursleys taught Harry three all important rules. These rules cause an emotionally repressed 11 year old to attend Hogwarts and discover his so called dead family aren't as dead as he believed.
#+end_quote

It's not for everyone, but The Mad Mad Reviewer's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/Jamie-Evans-and-Fate-s-Fool][Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool]] has the elements you're after. 77k words, complete (sequel in the works).

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!
#+end_quote

BajaB's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4641394/1/The-Substitute][The Substitute]], 36k words, complete.

#+begin_quote
  The magical contract made by the Goblet of Fire inadvertently sets underway events that change everything you thought you knew about the boy-who-lived. AU GOF, depressing and a bit dark.

*** Fyi, beyond the Pale is abadoned, not complete. What is there is good though.

Jamie/Fates fool is good (and complete, as advertised), but doesnt really have any twin factor, so i'm not sure why it was included.

**** The author's note on the last page of /Beyond the Pale/ indicates that the story is indeed complete.

/James/Fate/ is a "sib who wrongly gets credit" fic. The character Harry resurrects into was the one who defeated Voldemorl; that timeline's Harry was wrongly credited for defeating Voldemort. It's a minor part of the story, granted, but still has that element in common with /Unsung Hero/.

***** Rereadthe Beyond the pale note. It talks about the story being seven or eight chapters. There are only 4. The "finished" statement was only about finally getting that chapter done. Looking at notes on other chapters, people were bothering him about writting.

I had completely fogotten there was another Potter kid in Jamie/Fate.
