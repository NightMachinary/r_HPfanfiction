** Well, Voldemort could always try to capture Harry, dose him with the Draught of Living Death, and lock him inside his most secure vault. This way, no physical harm will ever come to Harry and he will be living for a very long time!

In addition, Voldemort could still proceed with taking over the Ministry, hunting down Muggleborns, and establishing a Pureblood tyranny. Unless we are dealing with an OOC Harry, the canon one would absolutely fight back. The war against Voldemort is essentially a war against sadistic genocidal Wizard Nazis, and goes way beyond the personal vendetta between Harry and Voldemort.

Finally from Harry's POV, it's: "My name is Harry Potter. You killed my parents, prepare to die!"

***** No sorry. I would be interested too. There is a lot of immortal Harry but not with Voldemort keeping him alive on purpose. More often than not it's because is Master of Death or only Voldemort could kill him so without him he can't die and so on.

**** Similar in which way? This is probably the only fic at this level of quality that really focuses on a more gritty story rather than fantastical and more in line with canon themes and atmosphere.

For stories where Voldemort won I'd go with linkffn(prince of the dark kingdom) this one has a completely different feel than this fic though. It has a heavy focus on a Harry and Voldemort student mentor relationship. No it's not slash. The story does get progressively darker as the years pass.

For something more dark I think linkffn(betrayal by butalearner) could work. This one is a dark story with a somewhat deranged Harry that is somewhat similar in world atmosphere but both much else.

I don't think I have a rec for a characterization of Harry that's similar, I don't think I have one because I think Harry not being our main narrator changes how we the reader perceive him and it isn't a very common choice as well as this Harry being fairly unique.

You might also like skitterleap by embilbly(this is probably spelt way wrong) it's basically a big AU that would be hard to explain that I personally couldn't really get into despite the fantastic writing and world building.

There's also like a lot that I haven't read that's good as shit so I'd recommend heading over to dlp and going through the library I promise you'll find a ton of new good ass stories.

** It started slow... Like jumping up when someone patted him on the back unexpectedly. Looking behind his back in empty corridor. Joking about security questions if they were to split in a fight. And then bloomed into full fledged paranoia Moody would be proud of. Not only Harry with single minded purpose learned new defensive spells, he dived into warding magics, barriers, Occlumency - anything that could help him survive.

When Voldemort met him next time, Harry who stood before him was anxiety ridden, trigger happy teenager with more ways to kill human being than even Dark Lord could imagine.
