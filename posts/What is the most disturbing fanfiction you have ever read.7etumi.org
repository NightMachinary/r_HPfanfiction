** A Veela's Worth or something like that. Harry ends up creating a family of Veela with Gabrielle or Fleur, then ends up fucking his kids. He fucks his 6 year old daughter, who's mom is Harry's daughter, who's mom is also Harry's daughter, and so on for a few generations. It's incest beyond incest.

He then cums inside her, shoves some bone dagger (wouldn't be surprised if it was another daughter's bone) /in/ her, rips up past the pelvic bone, splits her torn body and plucks out her egg, watches his sperm swim reach and fertilize the egg in awe and admiration, then swallows the entire thing.

** linkao3(Prince to Thieves by Serpenscript)

A lot of the fics that have been talked about so far sound really disturbing. I've read a couple of them, such as the JadeFalcon one that's been linked, but Prince to Thieves fucked me up for a while. When I read some gore fic, or something that was obviously written just to squick, it doesn't really have that much impact on me emotionally. This fic right here...This is one of those fics that disturbs me in the way that I can see how someone might think of it as cannon if they wanted it to be.

The impact of it is spoiled if I tell you what it is, or if you read the AO3 tags (something that I didn't do when I first read it). [[/spoiler][Snapes father catches him masturbating in a way that makes him think that Snape is gay, which he's not, and castrates him with a rubberbands.]] The way that it's written and set up really disturbed me emotionally and I couldn't get it out of my head for a long time.

***** Having not read either the Pokémon fanfic nor Squick, I'd say that Squick sounds more disturbing. The Pokémon fanfic sounds like rape with pseudo-bestiality. As far as fetish porn goes, mildly creepy, but Gardevoir looks humanoid, and a quite popular choice for Poképorn. Squick sounds like straight up incestuous necrophilia, and that also generally comes with a host of other disturbing fetishes, such as cannibalism.

They were to be trained as sex slaves by Snape, and then become party flavors at all Deatheater functions. It was a bloody long fic, and extremely EXTREMELY dark. I'm fairly certain it was the darkest fic I've ever read.

FIt's a short story, and things are more implied than shown, but the premise is that in her third year, Hermione is led into a trap by Fred and George, who prove to have been sexually abusing Ron, and then Harry, to the point of utterly breaking them, and now start doing the same to her.

  There was this one fic that I saw while browsing recently updated on ffn not too long ago. Was a Gabrielle/Harry story, hadn't read much of that at all so I thought I'd jump in. Most stories with her as a pairing have her older than 8, or after school years so the age difference is less of a factor. Nope, this story just goes "veelas want/are sex" and that it's completely normal for them to have sex to finish a bond. I managed to force myself to read past that (because I was bored, and didn't have much else to read). She was apparently going for a equality (marriage) bond, but then she got a slave bond. So now she's invisible and his pet, and now Harry supernaturally affects other girls to have lewd thoughts of him.

  I dropped it then, it wasn't exactly disturbing I guess, but more like "wot?"
#+end_quote

That's [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=315][The Unexpected Result Of...]], I think. A rare example of the non-age-retcon Harry/Gabrielle. Wouldn't expect to see it on ffn though, it's PWP.

** I think of the more serious ones, it has to be linkffn(6927447). VotN is probably my favourite non-canon-compliant author, just for the deliciously gory shit, but this one makes me feel uncomfortable.

Otherwise, has to be the aforementioned harry/ron has sex with hermione's corpse shit you find scattered around on the more rule-lax sites. Honestly makes me feel like vomiting.
