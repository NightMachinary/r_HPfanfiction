Any one know of any well-written Harry Quidditch centric stories? I recently red [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7711029/12/A-Game-of-Style-and-Brutality][A Game of Style and Brutality]] , which I really enjoyed, unfortunately it is abandoned 100k in. But is a post-Hogwarts story with a mix of Canon and New characters about Harry in professional quidditch world.

Just curious of other similar stories exist?


** The quidditch world cup is very good.

** This might not quite be what you're after since it's not about Harry (it's OC, don't hate me), but here's a quidditch-centric story that I've been working on for a little over a month now.

I'd never read 'A Game of Style and Brutality' before by the way, thanks for the recommendation.

*** OC is fine if the writings is good. I usually prefer stories where the characters are significantly different from canon.

Thanks for the recommendation, I'll start reading it!
