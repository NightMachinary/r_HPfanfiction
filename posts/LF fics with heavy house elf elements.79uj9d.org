Im always looking for fics where Harry learns new magic, or uses cannon elements in new ways. But as google is not friendly with these broad terms im hoping i can find help from you guys :)

So are there any good fics (any length but prefer longer, and no slash) where Harry learns house elf magic, or where Harry uses houseelves as a spy network, uses elves as thieves against deatheaters, or other interresting elements where fics uses houseelves in fun/devious ways?


** linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) and its sequel make great use of House-Elves. linkffn(Hermione Granger, Demonologist) has some House-Elf shenanigans towards the end, though the entire fic is pretty AU. And how could i forget linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them)?

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

** Hmm...well, I'm hesitant to recommend it, but around this time last year I wrote an extended prompt on Reddit for a 'Dobby owns Harry instead of the other way around' concept. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12277303/1/Copy-Paste-Write][I later copy-pasted it to Fanfiction.net.]]
