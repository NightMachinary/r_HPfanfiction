Any well written well loved dark Harry fic I have always been fascinated by how authors write in Harry in these types of stories, and am just look for a good one.


** The two that immediately come to mind are Sum of Their Parts and The God of Death. I think both are great, the latter has a sequel that is ongoing. linkffn(11858167) linkffn(11868509)

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  Some men were born average and went on to live an average life. He was not, had never been, and would never be one of those men. With his ancestry, it was hardly a surprise. Facing off against enemies old and new, very few things could come more naturally to him. No Slash. AU. Dimension Travel with a dash of Time Travel. Darker themes: war, politics, questionable morality, and etc.

** linkffn(Too young to die)

WBWL style fic where his little sister dies. Harry's goal is to resurrect her. Better than most WBWL, I recommend giving it a shot.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
