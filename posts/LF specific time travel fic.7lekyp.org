Harry travels back in time and kidnaps (I think) his child self from the Dursleys. I think he tells his younger self that he is him from the future. Also, he adopts (?) a genie who has the form of a girl, and I think he kills the people who had summoned her previously and abused her. The girl and Harry go to Hogwarts and end up in Slytherin.

There's a scene where Harry and younger Harry go to the pyramids and meet (I think) Bill Weasley and younger Harry brushes his hair from his forehead on purpose so that Bill knows he's Harry Potter and that he's safe / okay (because his older self basically kidnapped him).

And that's pretty much all I remember. Also younger Harry gets some kind of creature / spirit defender to protect him in Slytherin I think.


** This sounds like a very interesting story but I have no clue what it's called. Was it complete by any chance?

*** No, it wasn't. I can't remember if it was being actively updated, on hiatus, or abandoned, as I lost the link a while ago.
