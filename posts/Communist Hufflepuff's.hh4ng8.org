:END:
I remember a fanfic where Harry left a Communist Manifesto in the Hufflepuff common room.

If anyone could help me out with which fic this was, that'd be helpful.


** Was it my favorite fanfic of all time???? (Harry Potter becomes a Communist)linkffn

*** You can link a fic from FFN in 3 ways:

linkffn(Harry Potter Becomes a Communist by Hardcore Commie)

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9655837/1/Harry-Potter-Becomes-A-Communist]])

linkfnn(9655837)

The first acts like a google search, but sometimes it can return the wrong thing if you just do a title and not the full author name, too. The second uses the full url of the fic, and the third just uses the ID number of the fic.

EDIT: See? idk how a random fic from Katekyo Hitman Reborn! got added in here!
