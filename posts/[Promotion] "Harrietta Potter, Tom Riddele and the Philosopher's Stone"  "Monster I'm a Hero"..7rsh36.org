Hey everyone! I've been lurking here for awhile but never actually bothered to get an account. I have 2 stories out right now, "Harrietta Potter", which is a fem!Harry and diary!Tom friendship fic, which will cover year 1. The first chapter is very close to the first canon HP book, but there will be divergence. The idea was to explore what would happen if Harry was a girl and if she was under Tommy Boy's influence throughout her years at Hogwarts.

Read it here:

The second story I have out is "Monster? I'm a Hero." The thing is MASSIVELY AU, and features Grindelwald, a pretty evil heroine and Tom Riddle as Defense against the Dark Arts professor. I adopted it from a writer called Sephoria2 who'd pretty much just abandoned it. It's pretty Au for the sake of being AU, but I'm having a lot of fun writing Armina (the main character) and imagine some will enjoy reading it. You can find it here:

** That is a very long title! But yes I love girl Harry's and also Chamber of Secrets and the Diary Horcrux personality and plans so yes I will read that one! Does the Diary try to turn her evil and abuse her and stuff or is it like an AU change where it is good?

** Nope, Diary Tom isn't good, but he's not out to abuse or hurt Harry. He will probably try and make her evil though.
