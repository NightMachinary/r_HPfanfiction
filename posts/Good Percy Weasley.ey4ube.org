:END:
I remember reading a fic in which Percy is redeemed/good and he starts dating a muggle girl. When Fred and George find out they talk to hermiones parents to learn abt the muggle world so they can meet her. I think they went to a museum to see the dinosaurs? Also at the end Molly finds out abt Percy's gf and wants him to date a pure blood bc she doesn't want squib grand children. Anyone know of it?


** linkffn(11916243) and its kind-of-sequel linkffn(12373273). And yes, they are two awesome stories, the second even better than the first one (which is technically a Harmony story, but Harry&Hermione are in my opinion the weakest part of it).

** Someone else got you the answer. If you like Good Percy, also gonna recommend one of my favorites, linkffn(12181042). It's (I think) canon compliant about what Percy, Fleur, Bill, and Audrey get up to during the war, basically setting up a way to save muggleborns. Really good story, really intense. Warn that there is some smut going on but it doesn't overwhelm the story like some smut stories can.
