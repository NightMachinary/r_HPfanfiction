*** Also I would like to add, my 9th grade biology teacher had a minecraft youtube channel that I didn't know about until a couple of my classmates showed me it. There was no face but the voice was my teachers. I never asked my teacher about it because it just felt wrong.

*** I won't be surprise if a student found their teacher fanfic by pure chance. There are ways a students can find their teacher. How they write would be the biggest hint.

** Not so far. I've mentioned (to some older kids who I knew well) that fanfiction/fandom was useful as an analytical tool - they way you analyse your fandom and come up with hypotheses based on x or y canon material is what you're meant to do with essays. But I did not tell them I write it. Nope.

**** I really wish fanfiction was generally less pervy, because it would be such a good way to help students learn analysis ... but I would NOT introduce yr 7/yr 8 students to it.

***** I would reading some of Zirknaber's fanfics. It is not romantic, but are one of the best reads. A great story from is Of Clones and wizards. It is teens but it touches on dark matters. But it is awsome none the less.

****** It's not so much the matter of finding one non-pervy fanfic as much as if they go looking for fanfiction themselves after being told about it in schools, I cannot imagine the depths of the trash they would find, so I'd rather be safe. Also, the backlash from parents would be outstanding.

******* Too be honest the ones I have seen that are pervy are the more popular stuff such as Harry Potter and the worst witch. What would do is if they want to read a fanfic, but you don't want to get in trouble, refer to people like Zirknaber. Hell even Timothy zhan can be consider a fanfic writer. Fanfiction is usually when a author writes a story that has another author universe in it putting their own personal touch
