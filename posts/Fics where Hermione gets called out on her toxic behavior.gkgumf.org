Kinda sick of how there are so many fics that shit on Ron for not being perfect but have Hermione getting praised even when she does some fucked shit. Any fics where Hermione gets called out for scarring Marietta, attacking Ron with birds, continuously shading Fleur, etc?

Hermione would be a great character if she actually had to deal with the consequences of this toxic behavior.

edit: not looking for bashing, just looking for fics where she has to acknowledge that some of her actions are incredibly immature. criticism of a character != bashing


** I hadn't really put these to thought. But I do find it interesting that where just about EVERY other character in the series, ESPECIALLY the Weasleys, gets called out or downright villified in fanon by the author going by the most extreme examples of their characters. Hermione is largely left unscathed by such things.

Looking at examples even outside of Ron. Ginny is often called a whore for the simple reason that she dated two people before Harry. Completely ignoring the fact that teenage girls dating different boys in school is so common that it is never a concern in the real world. Or that Ginny is obsessed with the Boy-Who-Lived and doesn't actually care about Harry based on the fact that she hero-worshipped him as a young pre-pubescent girl. Completely ignoring the fact that she pretty clearly grew out of that by maybe the third book.

Molly Weasley is your stereotypical overbearing mum. But fanon would have you believe that she wishes to control her children's every action even into adulthood or even control everything in regards to any of the children around her. This due to her criticisms of Bill's relationship with Fleur, Bill's job, her ready support for Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione, and how she seems to argue with Sirius about what Harry should be doing in the summer of 5th year. The thing is, is that in her heart, she just wants what she thinks is best for her kids. She's not fond of the path that her boys have chosen. She sees them as too dangerous or in the case of the twins, silly and having a high chance of failure. This is the kind of reaction most parents in the real world would have. Also, of COURSE she would be extremely keen on a relationship between Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione. Harry and Hermione are like surrogate children of hers. She knows them and she'd likely find it cute that the childhood friends wound up together, especially since she wouldn't have to guess whether or not they'd be compatible.

There are a few stories that I've read that have called Hermione out for her behavior. But nowhere near the amount of backlash that gets meted out on the Weasleys and/or Dumbledore.

Most of the time when Hermione exhibits problematic behavior its excused by the narrative in some way or handwaved. She doesnt get to be wrong even when other characters do. The fics keep this up which is a shame because she gets less chance to grow as a character in canon and fanon.

******* I do see what you're saying.

With regard to the two specific examples:

I think Hagrid's reaction is perfectly normal - he's only really heard Hermione's side and she's on the brink of a breakdown. Bearing in mind that Hagrid thinks that Aragog wouldn't hurt a fly, he then hears that she's lost her friends because her cat chased a rat in a castle that specifically allows cats, rats and owls into the school.

To be honest, I would try to settle down that situation.

With regard to Ron, I don't think it really is shown as a dick move. Harry and Hermione are understandably upset/angry with the situation (no different to Hermione and Scabbers) The reader is told that the deluminator was given to Ron because he would always want to come back.

They're human mistakes in both cases. Certainly there were friendship dispute and disagreements at my secondary school, except in this case the teenagers have magic aggravating heightened emotions (e.g., the bird scene) but an absolute dearth of supervision. Not once do we see the staff actually supervising and fine, they have prefects but the prefects don't report the situation to the heads of houses.

The situation with the firebolt could have been considerably defused if McGonagal had spent a bit more time explained 'stripping' the firebolt in another way and given an approximate time scale for when he could hear next, some mediation between Hermione and Harry, etc.

******** oh to clarify im not saying that Hermione is bad here or the teachers responded poorly.

See conflict here starts for two reasons in the case of scabbers its Hermione is dismissive of Ron's concerns with scabbers and crookshanks she doubles down on being defensive after he's presumed dead.

In the case of the fireboldt she thinks she knows whats best for them so she tells the teacher without even trying to talk to them first. Even if she is right you can't decide things for friends like that. They are young here so its childish but these aren't good behaviors for a friendship and this is what the conflict is about.

She is apologetic later but its when Hagrid is telling them off and she's really miserable. So it comes off as them being very petty and blowing up at her for making a inconsequential mistake.

In contrast when Ron and Harry have a fight in book Ron was just a dick due to his own baggage understandable baggage but still not right be a dick. He owns up and you feel bitter at him cuz you saw how miserable it made Harry but you miss his absence like Harry and you accept the applogy give him the chance to make it up as he realizes hes a dumbass.

So the framing makes you hold Ron accountable and Hermione not so much. If that makes sense

So thats a bit what im talking about not what they do but how the narrative guides you to feel things that make Hermione right and therefore doesnt need to change and so any sorta growth she goes through kinda affects you less.

Consider how different it would be perceived if she applogized to them directly exaplained her pov and they told her well we were mad at you but you applogized said you would talk things through next time and we miss you applogy accepted.

**** IMO there are two actions where Hermione really dropped the ball. Malfoy and the firebolt. And the firebolt was kinda justified since, after all, she was right. Sirius Black did, in fact, send it to Harry. Going behind Harry's back was bad, but I do not think that he would have agreed to her logic there and surrendered his broom. And going to McG after Harry told her not to would have been even worse.

Now Malfoy is the big one, but she is far from the only one who failed there. You cannot give her shit there without also shitting on Ron, Lupin and some more (Ginny?). And I don't see Harry rub that in Hermione's face at Dumbledore's funeral either.

Which is honestly why Hermione is seen as Mary Sue. It is not that her actions have no consequences or everyone likes her, but her mistakes cannot be made visible due to plot demands. Too often, she is the tool for exposition.

If you want to do so at the Malfoy bit, it needs to be after Harry used Snape's spell in self-defence. And it would be hypocritical not to include Ron.

Edit: Right, Fleur. Again, she is not the only one who did wrong there. Basically all of the Weasleys made a mess there. Molly is the worst there IMO because she is supposed to become Fleur's MIL and the Tonks matchmaking bit, with Bill a close second for not doing anything. Then Arthur for not getting his family in order, Ginny since they were to become one family, Hermione (she was just a guest, no need to be rude) and Ron (teenager, pretty understandable if rude). Like with Malfoy, you cannot call Hermione out there without going after the worse offenders first. And if author's call that behaviour out, they usually include Hermione.

The first transfiguration they learn is actually specifically matchstick to needle in canon. The idea that you learn to turn anything to anything with more or less the same spell is a fanon thing.

Even though I do think it makes more sense than teaching 10,000,000 highly specific spells to turn each stupid useless thing into each other stupid useless thing. When the hell are you gonna need to turn a beetle into a button or a matchstick into a needle?

Worst case, turn a few twigs into metal bars and build yourself a crude cage. That is entirely possible with a bit of tape and the first transfiguration they learn.

Then she kept bringing Crookshanks up to the boys Dorm, where he went after Scabbers again, and justified it by 'You shouldn't let Scabbers run around' or something like that. Because apparently a students pet can't be safe in the dorm-room where there are supposed to be no cats.

Hermione's belief that 'cats hunting rats' justifies everything would have made sense if Ron had bought a pet rat AFTER she bought a cat, but she willingly bought someone who had already attempted to attack her friends pet rat in the store.

****** I think it's important to remember just how young they are in PoA. Even if teenagers seem mature, they fundamentally lack the same risk assessment and decision making skills seen in adults.

Yes, Hermione makes some mistakes and is insensitive, but the whole situation is fraught with stress. Hermione isn't saying these things because she's cruel; in all instances, Ron reacts angrily (because he is upset and stressed) and Hermione is responding in a high state of stress herself.

She consistently does act in ways that suggest she has regret, but the interaction between Ron and Hermione means that things quickly go downhill.

It all suggests to me that Hermione is too stressed out and perhaps a bit spotty in her decisions. It's important to keep in mind that <s>for the sake of plot</s> some adult approved time turners with an impossible workload for anyone, let alone the developing brain of a teenager. Hermione is consistently portrayed as on the verge of a breakdown throughout the book.

I would think in those circumstances she would have struggled more than usual to calming think about other people's view points, and potentially didn't know how to repair the situation afterwards.

It's implied that Hermione struggled to make friends prior to Hogwarts and, as writing in more detail by another poster, was potentially socially immature at that age. I think 'severely lacking empathy' is perhaps more pejorative than need be. In the 6th and 7th books it does seems she's caught up a bit.

It seems to me that she very much cares about her friends, but struggles to see things from other people's perspectives. She's also a very black and white thinker with regards to rules in her first year (beyond the age that children typically would be), so I could well imagine that her thought process was that scabbers had lived in the castle with the many other cats in the school.

Really, a staff member should have been supervising to step in to mediate the situation.

I'm not saying that it's all great, but I think fucked up is a bit far; if there wasn't any teenaged tension and they all got along just fine, I think it would have made for some flat characters.

******* It's not just with Ron that she shows a disturbing level of callousness when it comes to animals, though. In the same books, she acts the very same way about Lavender's pet rabbit just because she doesn't like Trelawney. And I think you are underestimating teenagers too much. Most thirteen year olds definitely have the tact to not start lecturing you about how you are a dumbass for believing in Divination when they find out your rabbit died.

And no, she absolutely hadn't caught up by 6th year. Ron gets so much hate for getting jealous during the Yule Ball, where he was only fourteen, when Hermione got so jealous at seventeen that she physically assaulted Ron.

******** Hm, I suppose it has been a while before I read them; mostly I remember that Ron struggled with tact and - when calm - Hermione makes comments indicating that she probably wouldn't have a rabbit repeat.

. I had put the canary incident in the wrong year (though I do think this says a lot about giving teenagers weapons).

Different teenagers react differently and I would argue the threat of Voldemort (or the time turner) puts the them into a different position regarding underlying stress and space for learning than your run of the mill teenager.

I absolutely remember teenagers getting into fights at my school and I remember that some of them were far less mature than others.

It's not that I'm underestimating teenagers, research shows that fundamentally teenagers do not have the same decision making and reasoning skills - however grown up they appear. Especially in the moment.

Nevertheless, yes - many 13 year olds would avoid a lecture when someone's pet had died. I would put a decent bet on Hermione thinking that it was comforting - when she is stressed, that's the sort of information she seeks out. Though I would allow that maybe she simply skipped past that to fact checking.

In either example, it suggests that Hermione struggles to take the perspective of another character, but I don't think she's a fundamentally bad person. The rabbit situation was tactless at best, but disturbing? I do think that - in real world terms - the staff had a responsibility to help her develop these skills and de-escalate situations.

From my perspective, just because someone should have a certain understanding and application of their understanding by fixed ages, doesn't mean they do - nor does it mean they are fundamentally 'disturbing'.

I also disagree with the hate Ron gets, btw.

For clarification, I should probably add that my speciality is challenging behaviour so it would be inappropriate for me to write-off children and young people. I'm used far higher levels of behaviour than shown in HP and have seen many successes. So I have a particular bee in my bonnet about it.

Remember, Ron was gleeful at how vicious Hermione acted and Harry was impressed by that jinx and told Cho that it was a "brilliant idea". The fanon perception of it being a horrible attack is not shared by anyone other that Cho.

Now I want to write something where the rest of the DA (other than Cho) can't decide between congratulating Hermione for a job well done or complaining that the boils were not enough.

** The kind of thing Hermione did to Marietta isn't considered a big deal in canon. Fred and George do worse in their pranks. And to be fair, she did snitch on them. She could have just cut contacts with the DA, but no, she had to be a tattletale.

For Hermione, Ron and Harry, they were fighting a war with Voldemort as a real threat due to his revival. I am disappointed that the consequence it brought Marietta was so small, which would be fixed by a trip to the Nurse's office. What Hermione was part of was an anti-government rebel group, so they had to take precautions.

I feel you're giving her a higher standard to hold herself accountable to when as far as I could see, her behavior was more reasonable than others.

Concerning Fleur, everyone has their dark sides, even you and me. Even Harry isn't perfect.

*** In my opinion, sometimes Hermione wasn't a good friend. She ratted out Harry to McGonagall on the broomstick, she should have talked further to Harry but she gave up after being outspoken by Ron. Harry would have listened to her if she gave an ultimatum. And don't forget fourth year, she is always trying and does manage to let Harry spill his private moments like his kiss with Cho while she didn't tell anyone about her yule ball date even Harry, she shades Fleur, knows how much Sirius means to Harry but still agrees with Molly in shading Sirius and got jealous of Harry because he was performing well in potions. And why was it wrong for Ron to date Lavender in the eyes of Hermione.. He didn't attack her over Viktor. She did over Lavender. This is not bashing but apart from third year she never got any kind of confrontation from Harry like Ron received. Ron wasn't a great friend either but Hermione wasn't one as well. And let's not forget, if she did care for Harry she would've found a way to contact him in fifth year, the smartest witch of her age

Marietta snitching makes perfect sense in the context of having to choose between a club that you dont care about and your own mothers job.

Do I think that Marietta joined Dumbledore's Army with the intention of selling them out? No, cause she literally could have done it at any time before.

Do I think that Marietta is a snake? Yes, if she was just gonna complain about Harry's teaching, she could have just left.

Do I think the punishment fits the crime? Absolutely not. If you think that permanently scarring and publicly shaming a girl who was worried for her mother's job is an appropriate punishment, then you might need to take a look at your own morals.

**** I'm not saying that DA was part of the war. But Harry, Ron and Hermione were fighting a passive war, and mistakes could have led to deaths. For example, if Umbridge had her way, they would've been carted off to azkaban or more likely, she'd arrange an 'accident' and have them kissed. This already happened to Harry before. So they were playing a high stakes game.

And I think the whole reason they made the club was to give atleast some training to the students when shit really hit the fan. Harry mentioned this when Umbridge asked him why they want practical traini g -because Voldemort's out there. Marietta could have, as a model daughter of a ministry employee, completely kept herself out of DA. But she didn't. She joined in and snitched on them.

She was worried if her mother's job would be threatened by her membership in the DA. So she could have just left. She knew very well Umbridge is a cruel woman. But she chose to betray everyone else by telling on the club.

Sometimes actions have consequences. The consequences for Harry and others would have been far greater than the consequences for her. Harry and others escaped by sheer luck alone.

The ministry was clearly immoral by that point and being part of the DA could have put a target on the students from both the ministry and the death eaters.

The whole thing was just a clever way to find anyone who snitched. but honestly they should have made an example of her: snitches get stitches and traitors get hanged drawn and quartered.

******* I'm not seeing a page or chapter number for any of that. I've been skimming the book and have yet to see a passage that confirms something to that effect. The wiki's useful but not necessarily word of god. If you can give me something definitive that would be stellar. The closest I've found is Ch 28, page 637, where Cho mentions her mother working for the ministry and that it's hard for her, which is kind of vague (though to be fair Harry did interrupt her). It could be she or her mother was threatened (which to be honest it does kind of feel that way), it could be Marietta is a ministry shill that believes every word they say, and just wanted good girl points from an authority figure (which feels equally likely to me).

Regardless of that I don't feel that sorry for her, and don't think Hermione did anything wrong. Cho is a bad friend for pressuring a friend into a situation she knew she wouldn't be comfortable with, and Marietta's a bad person for endangering the education of everyone in the DA for the crime of wanting to defend themselves, an idiot for going along with someone as unreasonable and untrustworthy as Umbridge, and just as much a bad friend as Cho for selling out her friend.

******** You may be right in a way, but Hermione should have told everybody about the consequences of breaking the secrecy before (or even after) they had signed. Rather, she kept it all to herself.

You have to admit that Hermione Granger is quite brutal at times (e.g., attacking Ron with birds for snogging a pretty girl in front of her) and she is even described to be “Scary but brilliant” multiple times throughout the series.

Marietta was in the wrong for being a snitch, but /(personal opinion)/ she didn't deserve her punishment. Marietta's scars still hadn't been gone the next year, so I'm assuming them to be permanent. Having a scar that literally declares you as a Snitch on your face can have life-long consequences (after all, who would want to hire a traitor) and her future was most-likely doomed because of that one scar.

Not to even mention that Kingsley had obliviated her later, so the poor girl doesn't even know why she has been branded a Snitch.

Also, I also don't think Cho is a bad friend. Cho did have many faults, but when you look at things from her perspective, she wasn't bad. Her boyfriend had been murdered. That itself is a enormous emotional toll on a person. She joined a group that she thought might help her either defend herself or allow her to do something in Cedric's memory or might distract her from her loss. So what if she decided to bring a friend along with her for emotional support?

********* Yeah, in retrospect it was something of a dick move. Fair point.

The SNEAK pimples did disappeared eventually, but left a few scars according to JK in an interview.

Cho brought a friend along whom she knew had family in a precarious position. If there is any truth that Marietta's mother was threatened with a sacking then Cho knew it, but put her needs before her friend's. I feel for Cho, I truly do, but putting a friend in a position where they have to chose between conflicting obligations is a shit thing to do. It's not like she needed Marietta in the DA, they're in the same house, maybe even share the same dorm room and classes. There's no reason she can't spend an hour or two studying defense and then going about her life.

Also to be clear I'm not calling for a witch hunt or bashing of Cho Chang. She was a 15-16 year old who lost her boyfriend via callous murder by the most powerful Dark Lord known. She had a lot of problems and grief to work through and I wholly empathize with that. It's just the actions she took at face value aren't great ones, in my opinion. Which is understandable given the circumstances.

I can't think of any specific fanfic that addresses that behavior(I've read a LOT and they tend to blend together), but generally with her constantly mugging for the attention of the professors, she is actually denying other students the professor's attention, when it's very likely that they need to engage with the class far more than Hermione ever would.

It's what they're paid to do. It would not be a difficult thing for McGonagall to say "Let's give someone a go, Miss Granger."

I know I've certainly had teachers who purposefully call out to people who almost never raise their hands, just to see if they're paying attention.

  Cho cried and she survived Pansy Parkinson's cruel jabs about a dead boy. She wept and she passed all her classes, kept up with Quidditch, watched fairweather friends scatter in the cold wind. She got very good at wordlessly summoning tissues and she joined the DA against her parents' wishes.They had told her to behave, begged her, ordered her, as the threatening darknesses of the world clung close even inside Hogwarts, and Cho walked out to the little pub in Hogsmeade and wrote her name down on Hermione's list.I hope someone in the DA told Cho that she ought to have been in Gryffindor. I hope she laughed at them, hard. Integrity. Truth. Honor. Dedication. These were the tenets of her House, of the blue and the bronze, the eagle called raven (called nerd, called stuck-up, called so many things that were not their names). Bravery was only one way to be a hero.

** Fanfiction made me really sick of and negative of Hermione, and nowadays I tend to skip fics in which she plays any sort of significant role, unless it's antagonist. But tbf, I think she was fully in the right with Marietta and the Firebolt.

So you're telling me that someone from the richest family in Britain is out to kill you, and suddenly after your broom is destroyed, the most high-end and expensive broom just finds its way to you, and no one can tell where it's from? All the while, you have a well known love for flying and someone already tried killing you on a broom just two years ago. The first thing I would do in such a situation is have it scanned for any kind of magic that there is, or ask a professor for help if I don't know how to do that. And don't tell me either canon Harry or Ron would have even considered that.

And Marietta got exactly what she deserved for treason. The DA were a bloody militia, y'all are acting like she snitched on some innocent homework group.

That being said, here are a couple of fics I enjoy about Saint Granger getting a check with reality:

Her intentions doesn't excuse her execution here. She maintained she did nothing wrong tho causing the conflict. But Hermione having the flaws isn't my problem. Its presented in a way thats dismissive of the initial conflict when its resolved. This could have been good character growth. Set up she has communication issues that can strain friendships and then have her handle a similar set up requiring communication with friends and have her handle it better and appreciate the growth. Especially if you can see its a struggle to communicate for her. It would have been compelling but by being dismissive of her flaws the potential is ruined

That was the point of DA, Umbridge wasn't teaching them so they had to learn it themselves. Sure the Trio started DA because Voldemort being back meant that everyone needed to learn those things, but those things were with the exception of the Patronus, just fifth year curriculum.

Also, did Marietta even believe that Voldemort was back? Her mother worked in the ministry and it is no stretch to assume that they believed the Ministry official line.

********* I'm shocked -shocked! - that a book written for the tween market did not use the word 'rape.' Imagine that. Since you never learned how to /read/ - rather than running your fingers along a line of type - I can understand you didn't catch the author's meaning, or connect basic mythology to the text. Since you've been denied the education and haven't developed intellectual interest, I'll just step out of the convo.

**** That's a pretty skewed interpretation of events, and just plain speculation at best with regards to the gang rape allegation. For one, Umbridge threatened to torture the main characters with the Cruciatus, and we have no reason to believe she wouldn't. She's shown herself to be fanatical and a sadist.

For another, Umbridge provoked the centaurs into attacking her without a single word or prompt from anyone else. All they did was ask who she was, and she spent every second she could spare insulting and threatening them. Hermione actually tried to stop her from running her mouth.

To suggest Hermione is responsible for whatever the centaurs did to Umbridge is just wrong, and shifts the blame pretty substantially. Hermione didn't knock the woman unconcious and hand her to a bunch of rapists. The worst you could say is she lead a bigot into a situation where said bigot would make an ass of herself, which she did under threat of torture. But Hermione didn't force Umbridge to insult and threaten a group of nervous and numerically superior centaurs, and she didn't force said centaurs to take offense and abduct Umbridge.
