I want to read about a canon compliant fic about Draco's years at Hogwarts. Bonus points for a fic with good insight into his home life. I'm looking for something that's true to the books (if such a story exists!), meaning no Dramione or Drarry, no abusive Lucius or any other silly tropes. I want see Draco interacting with his fellow Slytherins and get to see his vulnerable side without turning him into an OOC 'leather pants' Draco.

I think it's fine if Draco secretly both likes and envies the golden trio and/or wants to be friends with them but can't seeing as that's almost canon (if you regard Cursed Child as canon anyway). But just because he envies their friendship doesn't mean he suddenly thinks Hermione's hot or starts being nice to Harry out of the blue.

I want to see Draco in character. People have written canon rehash stories for characters like Ginny or Hermione but I've never seen any for Draco. It might not be the most exciting fic in the world, but I do think it would be an interesting perspective.

Does a fic like I'm describing exist?


** I definitely think it could be interesting, but I'd have a hard time reading a fic about his years at Hogwarts because I want to actually root for the main character and Draco from canon is fairly irredeemable. After Hogwarts could be interesting and at least I'd have something to root for.

*** Oh no, I totally agree with you. I'm mainly just curious whether anyone has ever attempted to do his canon story justice pre-Hogwarts. Kind of like a 'missing moments' type fic just to see what things might have been like for him.

** I know one that involves post-Hogwarts Draco. It basically describes Draco's struggles after the war and how he develops from it. Would you like to read it?

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/Exile][Exile]] by bennybear is about Draco's character growth after the war and how it affected his life. linkffn(6432055) Status: Completed

Also, definitely try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12834182/1/The-Little-King-s-Road][The Little King's Road]] by Lily-lamaire. I want to say that this is one of the most original, but closely cannon story that I have ever came across. The fic takes a fresh perspective of Draco and /kept/ him in character in the form of his prat-ish view of the world. He does not even realize what he was getting into. Another bonus that got me hype was the fact Draco is learning about Regulus' story and that was when he begins to open his eyes. It might not exactly be what you're looking for, but you seem like you'll enjoy this as well. linkffn(12834182) Status: Incomplete

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

  When fifth year Draco Malfoy becomes the only wizard to learn what exactly has become of Regulus Black, he makes a vow. Never will he share the traitorous Death Eater's fate. Yet every choice he makes - siding with the light, siding with the dark, siding with only himself - seems only to prod him further along that path.
