All I remember is he woke up without anything around him, conjured a mirror wandlessley, because he felt younger, and there's a female Harry Potter going through the GOF, he finds her while she's crying/upset. Also I already tried google searching as many possible combinations as I could, and still couldn't find it.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.
