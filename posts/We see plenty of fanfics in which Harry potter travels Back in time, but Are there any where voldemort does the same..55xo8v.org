Voldemort travels to the past either on purpose or by accident, and proceeds to win his war in some form.

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1810903][Seventeen Years]] fits. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1113639][Best Laid Plans]] is short but awesome. So is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4590039/1/Future-Imperfect][Future Imperfect]]. I lost interest in [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3905272][The Time of Love and Rogues]], but from memory LV does travel time himself as well.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11570512/1/Straight-Outta-1943][Straight Outta 1943]] Tom comes forward in time. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5725656/1/Fate-s-Favourite][Fate's Favourite]] also fits in that way.

  Voldemort is a day old when he realizes those blasted muggles had named him “Tom.” And he's a day old when it fully sinks in that yes, being reborn, legitimately, instead of from an experimental ritual, sucked. Because he has no idea where he is, what time he is in, who these people are... and he can't control who he is born with. Namely, some other brat who would take the title of his twin... his brother.He is a year old when it sinks in who his twin could possibly be.Because his twin might, possibly, probably be Harry Potter.

  Tom Riddle didn't mean to send himself to 1996, it just happened. However, once he arrives he decides to start over in this foreign time. Along the way, he meets the mastermind he always knew he could be and the friends he never thought he wanted.

  You always get the stories where Harry goes back into Tom Riddle's time, then either stays or gets sent back. End of, unless he tries to make Voldemort good. But what if things went differently? What if, just once, someone followed a time traveller back?

  After fools have meddled with time and unintentionally created a more powerful and immortal Dark Lord than the Wizarding World already knew, Lord Voldemort gives himself a gift in his past, a little brother named Harry Potter so that he can learn and weild the Love Magic the infant boy had been blessed with and become the most powerful wizard in the world.
