Read a few good and bad ones but overall enjoyed reading this pairing, I am looking for any romance based fanfics and complete please. Thanks x


** Some decent HGSS I've read, one each of the most common plots I've seen.

Post-war HGSS: linkffn(Semantics)

Marauder-era HGSS: linkffn(Pride of Time) -- not entirely canon-compilant, so some established events happen out of order compared to The Prince's Tale.

Teacher/student /non-smut/: linkffn(Pet Project)

The most common plot besides these are Marriage Law fics (based on a fic challenge from a community called WIKTT), but I usually avoid these. You may read one, but after reading one, you've basically read them all.

  Hermione quite literally crashes her way back through time by roughly twenty years. There is no going back; the only way is to go forward. And when one unwittingly interferes with time, what one expects may not be what time finds...

  Hermione overhears something she shouldn't concerning Professor Snape and decides that maybe the House-elves aren't the only ones in need of protection.

** Post Tenebras, Lux: 10 years post-war linkffn(6578435)

Same author has another story, Chasing the Sun, which is also good, but I prefer PTL.

  "After Darkness, Light." A chance meeting ten years after the war may not be just a coincidence, and may prove to have very far-reaching consequences. A story of many things, but primarily of healing. SS/HG; rated M for later chapters. Complete.

** I'd love if you took a look at some of mine !! I'll only include the complete ones:

/Hermione and Pansy unwittingly engage in vicious battle: who will bed Snape first? Only time will tell/.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15219878/chapters/35300171]]

/Snape's life is already going to hell and now his stupid brother has owled him to invite him to his wedding where Snape shall be the best man. Could it get any worse? Yes actually: the bride is a recently graduated Hermione Granger. AU./

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15260796/chapters/35398218]]

/All Hermione wanted was Black to like her and now she's created a lust potion with Snape caught in the middle of the whole mess, but not in the way that you'd think.../

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17034004/chapters/40049884]]

/When Neville Longbottom creates an enchanted mistletoe in hopes of winning Hannah's affections, he has no idea of the ramifications of such a creation. Especially on the likes of Hermione Granger and Severus Snape./

*** A taste of silence, Heart over mind, Pet project, Looking for love, Kitten, Severus Snapes's diary, Hermione's project, My real Parents, Magical betrothal, It happened one Hallows eve, The incident in the great hall, Signs and Vixen. Those are some of the ones I enjoyed most, not sure why but I loved Signs and Vixen lots. I think it was maybe the protective and caring nature of Snape in both while still portraying him correctly.
