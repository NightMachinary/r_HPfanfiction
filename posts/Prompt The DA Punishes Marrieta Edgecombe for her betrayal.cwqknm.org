Of the traitors we see in the Harry Potter book Marietta Edgecombe probably does the least damage and is also the youngest. But she is also the only one that we got no closure about in the books. We don't even find out if she turned up to fight at the battle of Hogwarts.

I don't really mind how they punish her as long as she also apologising to the whole group.

The punishment could happen before or after she apologises. The Da could go the prank war route were they prank her to the point were she throws herself at the Mercy of the Whole DA and begs them for forgiveness Or It could go the route of Marrieta going to the Group herself to Apologise and the DA say they will only accept her apology if she accepts a Punishment.(I personally think that Marrieta would not be brave enough to go back to the DA and Apologies unless their was an outside source of pressure that was worse In Marrieta mind than anything The DA Would ever do to her).

I prefer no Character bashing. I would also point out that Marrieta was probably not on Umbridges good side after embarrassing her Infront of fudge. And I would be Completely unsurprised If Marrieta spent a few weeks in Umbridges Office getting her Own "I Will not tell lies scar" after all to Umbridge Marrieta just Lied and Marrieta would have been the perfect victim to take any anger out on over Dumbledores escape, especially Since Dumbledore Came to Marrieta defence when Umbridge was assaulting her.


** She has the word "Sneak" written across her face with pimples, a shattered social life (doubt anyone except Cho stayed her friend), and she can't even remember why it's like this because Kingsley wiped her memories of the DA.

What's more do you want?

*** I guess I want a story that starts when Marietta betrayed the DA and ends with Marietta getting Forgiveness from the DA. that stays mostly Focused on Marietta and the DA.

I also do think that other member of the DA would have gotten revenge on Marietta and was wondering what other people thought they might have done.

I also want people opinion on what they think Umbridge did to Marietta for embarrassing her in front of fudge. I personly think that Marietta probably ended up with her own "I Will not tell lies scar" but other people might have a differnt opinon on what Umbridge would have done.

**** I'mginna hae to say that that is very petty. She is a child, and like someone on this sub convinced me, doesn't actually deserve all she got. You understand that the Sneak pimples left scarring for her time after, and she lost almost all her friends, don't forget that her "betrayel" wasn't exactly something that was 100% her fault, and it didn't actually lead to any deaths, or injuries. I think that Marietta(again, a CHILD) got more than she deserved, and you asking for something worse than canon is pretty vindictive.

***** Your Preaching to the Choir, I already agree with you. I am mainly looking for Different options on what Happened to Marrieta around the time she betrayed the DA to like the end of 6th year.

Like I do think that At Least some members of the DA would have gotten their own revenge on Marrieta at the very least the weasley Twins would have, I also think that Umbridge would have punished Marrieta for Embarrassing her. I don't think that these thing are right but I do think they are in character. We just don't see it in the books because outside of outing the DA Marrieta isn't important.

Like I kind of wonder if Cho Chang thought the Memory charm was Hermiones doing.After all to make someone forgot the reason they are being Punished is a nasty thing to do.

Like I don't think Marrieta lacked loyalty, she was loyal to Cho being the only friend that stayed with her, even going as far as to join a group that she probably knew was going to get her in trouble with her parents, she was loyal to her parents. Marrieta problem was that she lacked courage or at least that was impression I don't of her from reading the wiki article on her.

I am mainly looking for a story were Marrieta gets humanized but if I can't get that I will take Woobified Marrieta.

** This brought back memories of a horrifying Ao3 fic where Umbridge punishes Hermione with the DA in a horrific way

** One suggestion for what they could do is something similar to an Age line but keyed to Marietta that vanish her makeup, balaclava,ect or anything else she tries to use to hide her face.

As for were to Put it across the Line I woudl go with across the doors to the Great hall.

maybe add a randomized time delay function. the effect trigger radomly over the next two hours. so it would happen at least 3 time a day and would be harder for her to work out how it was happening.

Mabye have that be part of the reason that Cho starts to forgive Marietta early because Marietta was given something by madam pomfrey to put on her face at night to stop her from permanently damaging her face by poping the pimples but the vanshing effect tigger after she went to sleep one night leading to them all bursting in her sleep.

So Cho has to take a crying Marietta to the Hospital wing and starts feeling a bit back about what they are doing. and mabye being the thing that start Cho alone the path of forgiveing Marietta more quickly than the rest of the DA.

As for why the Effect trigger after she went to sleep, I would do with her forgoting something in the Great hall and have her grab it on her way to bed after a detetion with Umbridge for lying to her.

So to the DA its a Simple prank to stop Marietta from Covering Up that she is a Sneak.But out of their site it has a much bigger effect than they intended.(sort of a *"be kind for everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about"* type situation)
