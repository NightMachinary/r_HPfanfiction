** "I cannot live like that" James was pacing around Sirious living room, aggravated. The rest of Marauders were looking at him with varying levels of pity. "I mean, getting married sounded like a good idea! And it's Lily! But now - all that married life is stifling me. We were arguing about color of guest slippers yesterday! Where is passion! We are like old coots now! And a crying child, let's not even start there. I mean, Harry can be pretty cute, but Merlin, I miss silence. I never through I will say it in my life but... I haven't slept full night in months!" James pulled haphazardly at his hair, bloodshot eyes scaning wildly the room. Peter made a commiserating noise. Remus and Sirius just exchanges a Look™.

"Maybe you should hire a wet maid" suggested Remus mildly.

"That's the point! Lily will *never* agree to it! It's some muggleborn stuff but she won't even let a hause elf help. I mean, she made poor Miffy cried when I tried! And she changed my own nappies, she's a pro! But noooo-"

James sat heavily.

"I regret everything. I did not think it through" this time all of his friends exchanged loaded looks of unvoiced understanding. They were staying bachelors /forever/, that was official now.

When no further noises of pity nor helpful advice were send his way, James slumped in his armchair. Why did he even went for a muggleborn anyway? Sure, Lily was great, but he should do as his parents suggested and get a more down to Merlins's sweet earth pureblood. A nice sensible Brown? Or maybe McMillan?

"You know what? I think what I need is a /divorce/"

The silence that filled the room sounded to young James particoularly ominous.

He ripped his gaze from the ceiling and it's inappropriate wallaper of young witches in neglee. And indeed, the Looks™ his guys were sending each other went from pity and understanding to uncomfortable battle of will in a way of who's-gonna-be-the-one-to-tell-the-poor-sod. Shiver run against James spine. His honed danger sense told him it's a good time to prance stright to the nearest forest.

At last the combined stares of Peter and Remus compelled Sirius to clear his throat and speak.

"James, my boy" Started Sirius in poor imitation of the Headmaster. He was clearly uncomfortable. "I think you forgot: Wizarding World */don't have divorces/*."

James face became a mask of horrified realisation as a long ignored memory surfaced. Wizarding law indeed did not posses yet divorces.

It had widowers and widows tho.

"... I think I need your help. "

*** ... It escalated quickly.

All in all the last joint Marauder Grand Plan resulted in few deaths, few more botched memory charms, 1 one-way visit to Azkaban and accidental obliteration of a local Dark Lord

(who happed to be nearby and was unwillingly recruited as a scapegoat. He vehemently disagreed - as seen by higher death rate than initially intended - but it's another story).

*** well if James fabricated the Prophecy

and snape reported the Prophecy to voldemort

that would mean snape was part of the plot.

Snape and James both realise seperately that Lilly is not muggleborn but part of an evil wizardingly cult far more evil and far older then the death eaters

Soon after Harry is born, James works out lilly and the cult plans to sacrifice harry for a magical ritual.

Snape helps James out of revenge for the fact lilly lied to him and used him from the start

James and snape end up becoming bro's

Voldemort takes the fall

James potter, using the fame of defeating voldemort after the tragic loss of his wife rises to minister of magic where he now plots to root out and destroy the cult.

**** Excuse me, can you tell the cults' name, Minister? It's just, I happen to have a few leaflets and need to know if I can keep giving them out or should I incendio them to destroy evidence in current political climate. Thank you for understanding, Minister Potter.... WHERE ARE THOSE AURORS TAKING ME?!

**** Actually, this reminds me of an idea I had once after reading one too many Lily-bash fics (Snape-centric, not James-centric), basically "what if Snape and James discover that Lily is evil somehow and reluctantly team up to deal with it". IIRC the idea started off with Lily exploiting Snape and James' hatred for each other and jealousy over her for her own ends (marrying James for the money but pretends to be unhappy because of an abusive James to Snape to abuse his own feelings to use his raw potions skill for something) and they inadvertly run into each other outside of her control, and after some pointed questions realize that they're being had.

Basically. Lily pretends to fall for James and marries him for his money and status. She pretends to be happily married to him, but asks James to stay away from Snape because they're still decent friends (but "only friends"). Meanwhile, she also goes to Snape, pretending to be in an abusive relationship with James, and pretends to seek out his protection, using him for something (Snape doesn't have money, but he has magical skill that Lily intends to steal for her own). At the same time she maintains to Snape that he should stay away from James "because who knows what a rich and spoiled Auror would do, and I don't want you in trouble". But ultimately, Snape doesn't take her advice and confronts James. After it's obvious that they're both being lied to (Snape taking the "shoot first, ask questions later" approach and Legilimizes James, trying to find evidence on abuse, only for it to be suspiciously lacking in favour of a seemingly happy marriage), they devise a revenge scheme -- while they detest each other, they're both heartbroken realizing Lily isn't who she pretends to be.

*** It's about as big as the hate boner in a story where James was Love Potioning Lily and Peter, and Lily became a Death Eater after Voldemort killed James and the love potion 'wore off' because James died. It's real but I don't remember the name of it unfortunately.

**** linkao3(Lily Evans, Death Eater)

Didn't really like the fic, but it was clearly meant to be crack, so not really a fic to be taken seriously.

  Lily hated that toerag James Potter until suddenly she didn't and they were madly in love. What if it was a love potion?What if she was set free the moment James died?What if that was enough to make her switch sides?(Starts angsty, then gets a bit cracky)
