** This is the only one I can think of. Mostly smut, contains twincest (Harry/FTwin), unfortunately abandoned. There's a censored version on ff.net, this is the uncensored one: linkffa(1382) - Twins by Angles of Death [sic]

#+begin_quote
  What if Harry had a twin sister, someone who grew up with him as they ventured through life together, instead of him facing the world by himself. And Malfoy has a sister as well, which makes life even more chaotic. Sequel to Battle of Wills, with AU elements. Story begins with Harry's 4th year. Harry/OC/OC/Fleur. Warning: wincest, BDSM, harem.

*** Is this the one where Harry's twin loses a bet and sends him to be Draco's sister's slave for a day?

** Never seen this before... It would have to be an AU where Draco wasn't an only child.

**** I know, I really felt like Captain Obvious typing that up... and yet I've also realized since posting it how little we actually know of the Malfoy family. /Does/ Draco have an older sibling who graduated Hogwarts many years previously and maybe lives in Europe or something? I honestly can't remember if the books ever directly stated that he was an only child, or if it was always just implied.

****** Makes sense. If he hadn't been, you'd think he would have spent some time bragging about what a bigshot his older brother/sister was - not to mention that they would have been at the Quidditch World Cup with the other Malfoys.

(Unless, of course, this older sibling is estranged from the rest of the family... but I think we would have heard /something/ about them from JKR by now.)

******* If she got pregnant right out of Hogwarts then the child would have been born before September 73, graduating from Hogwarts June 91, 2 months before Draco would start Hogwarts. Not really much time for that sibling to become anything, and in fact as a second child Draco might have been jealous, he most certainly fits the type. Still, she might not have even married until 79....

****** There are a few stories where he has an older brother or Narcissa miscarried her first child but nothing canon based.

*** I think I've seen one before but it was abandoned before it ever really got started. There was also one where Draco's sister was several years older than him and was brought in to tutor Harry in potions, but it was basically just smut. Can't remember what it was called either. It's an interesting idea however that I'd love to see explored.
