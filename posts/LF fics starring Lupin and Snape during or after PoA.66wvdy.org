I'd love to find a story that shows their interactions as adults at Hogwarts, or how they dealt with each other in the Order, etc. Not into RL/SS (but I'm a big fan of Remus/Sirius so if there are hints of that, bonus).


** linkao3(Swung by Serafim by Flamethrower) starts at the beginning of PoA. Mostly it focuses on Snape, which necessitates all of the other professors as well. There's Lupin, but there's also a lot of McGonagall, Flitwick, Sprout, and Dumbledore. And of course, there's a lot of Harry. It's genuinely funny, but not cracky, and it has an interesting premise. Definitely worth the read!

  In 1993, Gilderoy Lockhart points a stolen wand at Harry Potter and Ron Weasley with the intent to Obliviate them.The wand doesn't backfire. Gilderoy's "discovery" of the Chamber of Secrets is a short-term success.Other consequences are not short-term at all.
