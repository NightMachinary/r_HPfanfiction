I'm looking for powerful harry stories covering the Hogwarts years. Bonus points for all 7 years covered and no good guys dying.

The important thing is the stories must be already finished.

can anyone help me out?


** Hmm, have you considered looking over at some Peggy Sue fics? That usually satisfy your requirement since:

- Harry is from the future, and thus is automatically Super!Harry, or at least for the first 5 or so years
- He'll try and prevent as much death as possible, so at least the death count will be smaller than canon. Named characters at least, I can't say about unnamed.

** Well the Sacrifices Arc by lightning on the wave is the only powerful!Harry AU that I know of that also covers all 7 years. It doesn't get full bonus points because some good guys unfortunately don't make it, but I can't think of any other fics like that.

** There are many. Without more detail on what you're after, it's a bit of a crapshoot making recs. Probably your best bet is to go to one of the C2s on fanfiction.net devoted to completed stories and look for highly rated or recommended stories.

Four C2s that I find particularly good:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/DLP-5-Starred-and-Featured-Authors/84507/99/0/1/0/0/2/0/][The DLP C2]], filtered for Completed stories in the link.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Good-Stuff-Edited-by-Perspicacity/93584/99/0/1/0/0/2/0/][Perspicacity's C2]], also filtered for Completed stories (a variety of fandoms, but primarily Harry Potter).

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/DEL-s-Favorite-Complete-Harry-Potter-Stories/43786/][Dobby Elf Lord's C2]], which has 234 completed stories, all Harry Potter.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/DM-s-Best-Completed-Stories/88816/][Darth Marrs's C2]], which lists nearly 500 completed stories from a variety of fandoms.
