*** Agreed. If a fic wants to shortcut a lot of development (and let's be honest, how many fics really go through 7 years to have him end up as a young adult), it definitely makes sense to up the ages a good bit.

It's particularly egregious in the 'political' fics - where you've got 11 year olds talking in super stilted language and acting like tiny adults. Just up the ages a few years and you can have your political slytherins from year 1.

**** I maintain that it is possible to bring politics into a normal-ages HP fic without dumbing down - /as long as the author actually thinks about character when introducing political exposition or conflict/, instead of using characters as incidental mouthpieces for some particular dialogue they think sounds cool. Eleven year olds aren't stupid, but they aren't anything like what some authors portray them as.

***** It's possible, for sure - but it's not really that possible to have all the main political actors as 11 year olds, you know? If you want Harry and his friends/other students to be making important decisions and deals/plans with politics, they really do need to be aged up a bit to work. (Edit - at least, if wanting to start it from year 1)

That's assuming that the political situation and dealing with it is an integral part of the plot of that story, though - like you say, injecting a bit of the WW politics into the later years of the canon Harry Potter timeline would not be a problem.

***** In our western society, maybe, remember your outlook in life can be quite different depending on how you are raised and how things are framed for you. Some countries like India and others still practice this, especially amongst the richer families, it's getting out of fashion(as far as we know) but it is prevalent enough in society to have survived well into the 21st Century.

Some fics explore this with arranged marriages, with Hermione huffing and puffing about barbaric practices, and Ron just shrugging and saying that's how rich people have been doing since ever. It's not hard to believe an insular society would still practice this.

***** Exactly no sane or no well educated kid would, but we all know that education is all and if the children are raised to accept betrothal contracts and similar they will accept the harem the same way. And of course polygamy is very prohibited in our occidental civilisation but there are others were it is accepted and so of course the kids are taught to accept it or to not find any reprehensible thing in it.

****** I think a betrothal contract society wouldn't be enough for that - arranged marriages were quite common in aristocratic Europe in the past, and that wouldn't make polygamy/a harem acceptable there.

You'd need to add something further to it to make it fitting socially - something like the Firebird Trilogy, which rewrites the setting to have a huge imbalance of numbers between witches and wizards.

That's because they had this pesky little organization called the Catholic Church who wanted to be the Sex Police, it got to a point people started creating their own religions just to get rid of them Popes meddling with who they could sleep with.

I doubt Wizards would care about something the organization who sponsored their persecution would say about what they could or couldn't do.

******** The Catholic church was not the only reason people were monogamous... Nor was it christianity in general, either.

It's fine to switch things up for a wizarding society. But it would need a pretty substantial change to social dynamics to make harems a normal thing of life, and /just/ adding betrothal contracts is not enough there.

That's particularly true if the Wizarding World stays as small in numbers as it is in canon.

********* Then how come in almost any other society that was not Christian or similar the upper echelons of society had at /least/ concubines? Even the advanced ones.

Muslim, Indian, Mongol, Old Chinese, Old Japanse, even old Hebrew all these had men(and sometimes women) who were capable of doing so having more than one spouse, the limitation for one was normally tied to financial issues.

The Romans and Greeks may have had one spouse(I honestly don't recall), but they were so free with that stuff the marriage part was almost purely for legal reasons of inheritance.

Even old pagan European societies had polygamous relationships not being out of the norm. Yes, many chose to be monogamous but those that weren't were not persecuted unless they did something illegal or were not in the right group to do so.

I am not saying it's right, just that it happened.

********** The tie between Christianity and monogamy came more from when it joined with the Greco-Roman world, which already had those values. See [[https://www.princeton.edu/%7Epswpc/pdfs/scheidel/010903.pdf][here]] for a paper talking about that, which also notes that monogamy was present in ~20% of societies - drawing from [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249179301_Regions_Based_on_Social_Structure][here]].

Furthermore, the WW was fairly decently integrated with the muggle one until the Statute of Secrecy - and still has muggleborns coming in since. Changing the cultural norms of the region that /does/ require a pretty big jump.

What I'd say is reasonable would be an arranged marriage + a mistress or affairs on the side, for the WW - that'd fit in fairly well with European nobility from the period that purebloods fics tend to draw inspiration from. If going further than that, particularly with the small numerical size of the universe, it'd take a pretty wide shift to make multiple marriages accepted/standard IMO. It's not impossible to do so by any means, but just shoehorning it in to give Harry a harem will be out of place.

******* Of course it was common, it was the easy way to settle wars and feuds between families. And tu further the family status. And it served to pacify the Kingdoms, peace between Kingdom could only be obtained by a union between two royals that could not be broken. A King never married for love but for the Kingdom. Or simply add the same, you never marry for love but for the family or lineage be it single or multiple. And I hate to add but the Harry Potter society is of course strongly patriarchal in those types of fanfics. In fact all nobility is always patriarchal, the line being fully transmitted in the male line, the female line being absorbed when possible. And with it the notion of Lady of the Manor.

** Yeah, but in order to successfully do that you also need to build a solid AU backstory. The stories that are like "Harry snaps" tend to take cannon Harry at age 16 and just make him completely different with basically no reason what so ever other than the plot says so.

If you start him at 11 you need to take it slow and show the transition from cannon 11 yo Harry to whatever you want him to become when he's 16.

If he's already 16 then you still need to have that slow transition, you just don't have to write it.

*** I believe the OP's suggestion was to shift Hogwarts so that Year 1 = 16 years old (or an older age than 11 - I like 14 personally, which would make 4th year when they turn 18 and a logical place to shift OWLs to).

In that respect, his AU backstory can be pretty light - because he still hasn't been introduced to the magical world and can keep plodding along.

***** It just depends on what kind of story the author wants to tell. If it's going to be heavy on politics and more adult/complicated storylines, while still combining with the discovery of magic and learning angle, it makes sense to change the age around. If it wants to keep the dynamics of it being children, it's obviously not necessary.

But a lot of fics have the 11 year olds talking and reasoning as though they're adults - that's just ill-fitting.
