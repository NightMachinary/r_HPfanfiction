Sort of a 'Love as the world ends around them' sort of vibe,they can't leave the house, nor do they have any incentive to anymore, so they just cuddle in bed and make tender conversation, with little character bashing (Which'll be easy cause they're all dead, see?)


** Fuck there's that one where Grindelwald raises Harry. Linkffn(hail Odysseus) I think

There's also a one shot I can't remember the name of where Harry and Daphne are trying to flee England after the war goes badly

Edit: I tried to reread it cuz I hadn't read it in a while and I recced it and there's a fuck ton of bashing and Harry wank shit so be forewarned

#+begin_quote
  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.
