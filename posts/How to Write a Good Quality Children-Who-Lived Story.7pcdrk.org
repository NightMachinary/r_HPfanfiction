** Why are they sorted into Slytherin? Is there some reasoning, is their personality suited for Slytherin?

In general, the real issue with twin/sibling fics is the sheer amount of absurdity injected into the plot "just because".

Create real plotlines. Yes, there will be some strain and tension in Harry's relationship with his sibling. Fame will cause that. No James and Lily won't ignore and abandon one child. According to canon, they were both good people who valued family.

I know you've probably read HP&BWL, but linkffn(Anti-Hyphen) is quite good too.

**** Sure - linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived)

Good luck on the Slytherin characterisation. It's hard to pull off. As an author, you have to walk a fine line between interesting and cliche. Too many Slytherin potters become edgelords.

linkffn(On the Way to Greatness) is the best Slytherin Harry

****** James and Lily would know a lot of people. James grew up in Wizarding Britain, both went to Hogwarts, both were in the order, and after Voldemort's death, they were likely minor celebrities. I simply don't get the "girl who lived was put into Slytherin, let's drop her" attitude. Especially since I doubt that Dumbledore would care. And if Slughorn stayed on as head of house, then I don't think Slytherin would have an evil reputation anyway.

  The wizarding world has always struck me as both heavily segregated and affected by prejudices and biases. I believe that-born of a Light-affiliated family- that the number of contacts within the Magical world would be limited. I could foresee families such as the Weaselys, Longbottoms, etc, forming connections with a fledgling Potter family. *fledgling as in this generation of Potters.

Reread books, fanon is influencing your perception of wizarding Britain too heavily.

** Just read your updated post. Losing her friends seems to be a convenient device for your protaganist to face trials and tribulations.

A good story usually gets one "just accept it" plot point. Right now you have both parents alive, Slytherin, dueling, and Snape. Take some time to chart out a backstory. Remember, you may not ever put your backstory into the actual plot, but having those notes adds a level of coherence. GRRM had a 1000 pages of notes on Westeros before he started writing aGoT

** Alright, I see two issues with your premise.

1) The Dueling circuit as main plot point of a fic where the MCs start at age 11. Either the girl is ridiculously overpowered, the duels are boring or you have years filled with nothing but filler. Unless she is on Merlin's level a first/second year witch would be useless in a duel. Children duels do not sound very interesting due to the limited amount of spells used. Even a fifteen year old girl would realistically stand no chance against people on the level of Dolohov or the Lestranges. During the Battle of Hogwarts Bellatrix was fighting Ginny, Luna and Hermione to a standstill. That is the level an international competition would be at. Hell, Harry never won a duel against Voldemort without some very unlikely circumstances.

2) Snape as a mentor. Just how and why? Lily came up with something to kill the worst wizard in living memory. James wasn't bad at fighting either. Just why would the girl need a mentor? I mean, her parents know how to sneak into Hogwarts so it's not like they would ignore that their daughter is having a really horrible time in the castle.

There's also the fact that Snape became a Death Eater. You know, the war criminals trying to kill muggleborns like Lily. I can't see Lily overlooking that, especially after the leaked prophecy and the reason for Snape's "redemption". Because loving a married woman is really creepy. Why is Dumbledore keeping Snape around in the first place? He is not anticipating the need of a spy. Maybe the "redemption" convinced Dumbledore to keep him out of Azkaban but why let him teach for a decade? Snape is objectively a bad professor who knows nothing about teaching. He might be a prodigy in the subject of Potions but he cannot convey that knowledge.

*** Yeah, Snape makes not much sense.

Also, I'd not start the story in first year. With Voldemort dead, most of the canon plot has been rendered moot, so you don't need to have kids be the heroes, and all the trouble (useless adults) that causes. If you want to focus on duelling and mentor Snape, why not start after Hogwarts and have Snape be an accomplished duellist, and have him get involved that way?

**** 1) The low level and age duels are boring unless the characters are OP. Imagine giving two teens swords and telling them to fight with far too little training and muscle. They will botcher techniques and it will not be very interesting to watch. It's like children and football. Having them train is alright, even small tournaments and local leagues (Hogwarts duelling club) but there is a reason why there are no international competitions below a certain age. And you can learn football a lot easier than mortal combat.

2) Snape did not even consider that Lily would forfeit her life for Harry. He wanted her spared so that he could have another go.

The Death Eaters are not a political party, they are a magical SA/SS ripoff. A terrorist organisation. And by voluntarily joined them Snape performed an inexcusable act in the eyes of every Muggleborn (this includes Lily). He was working towards a genocide, towards a Final Solution. A Muggleborn Holocaust. I don't think you realise how vile that group was. When in power they turned Azkaban into a concentration camp. There is no way a Muggleborn could forgive that. Snape was a member of the inner circle, was marked, not just some unimportant underling. He only avoided a lifelong relationship with the Dementors due to Dumbledore +abusing his power+ intervening. And let's not forget that Snape was the one who painted a target on the Potters. I can see him living in another country. But even a working relationship with a Potter? Seems impossible in the light of his crimes.

As for Lily and James helping their children. In the scenario you outlined (total abandonment, hostility), Harry&Twin have no one. It is not too far-fetched that James (or Lily) would sneak into Hogwarts and spent time with them in that case. They are loving parents. They have a near-perfect invisibility cloak. They would not leave their children alone in a castle six hundred miles away. A parent's first obligation is his/her child so the Diagon Alley book club will have to make due with a member less. If they had time for their children before Hogwarts then two hours each day or even twice a week is no problem.

** First off, I think your idea has merit. Second off, I think you're going to need some solid divergence and world building to pull this off. One of the biggest obstacles to overcome will be Snape -- why is he teaching DADA? What happened with the Death Eaters? What is his relationship with James and Lily Potter? As a reader, I wouldn't buy canon-Snape being on good terms at all with the Potters, so you'd have to establish why your Snape is different.

You'll also need to establish why the GWC is sorted into Slytherin. Maybe she wants to make something of herself beyond her fame, maybe she's just very clever.

The other thing I see a potential issue with is the friends. Like you've said in one of the comments, eleven-year-olds are fickle creatures. That being said, I don't think they'd completely abandon the GWC. What I think is more believable is that they start giving her the cold shoulder because she's been sorted into Slytherin, GWC is upset, starts making new friends, and then when the old friends try to rejoin her, she decides to ignore them because she's still mad (or something along those lines).

I think with the changes in backstory/divergences/worldbuilding you need, you could probably start in first year -- you don't necessarily need to tell first year in 60k words, but you could tell it in several chapters, just to hit the highlights.

Again, I do think you have a good idea, and one that I'd read. I think it just needs to be developed a bit more. :)

** I also don't get the point of isolating the kids. What do you gain by cutting off their social network? Are you so fond of a bunch of junior Nazis (Draco and friends) and OCs with a canon name (Daphne is mentioned once in the entire series, and only because her name starts with G and she's in the same group as Hermione)?

To be honest, the most important (and most original) part of the story seems to be the duelling focus. The whole "Slytherin means she'll be isolated" stuff seems pointlessly emo (or a forced setup to make Lily fall in love with a junior nazi like Draco, or an OC with Draco's name). Having her keep her friends despite being in Gryffindor, or putting her in another house, and having her meet Snape as an adult on the circuit might work better.

(Also, Slytherins probably weren't that infamous in Lily's time - she was in the slug club, after all, headed by Slughorn. If Snape doesn't take over the house and turns it into a Nazi youth group, I don't think Slytherin would have a really bad reputation - Slughorn would have managed to restore the damage done by so many Slytherin Death Eaters, and would likely have kept the students from turning into open bigots like Draco and his ilk.)
