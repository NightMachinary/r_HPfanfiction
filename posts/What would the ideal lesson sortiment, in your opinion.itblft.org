The title is probably not really accurate. What I mean is this:

What lessons would you, personally, make available at Hogwarts, if your goal was to create the optimal learning environment?

Add fanon stuff, such as fanon occlumency, wards, enchantments, etc as you please, those only make it more interesting.

*** I like muggle/wizard studies, though I think I'd make those mandatory for either wizard-raised or muggle-raised students, respectively, and then create a shared "cultural appreciation" class after both sides have had a crash course in the other.

Wizard-raised students learn about what the muggle world looks like, what to look out for when entering it (cars, cameras, cellphones, etc), as well as an abridged history presented in such a way that researching it further is made desireable; additionally, they learn how to disguise oneself using muggle clothes and mannerisms, and in the last few lessons are given ways to stay up to date with said disguises.

Muggle-raised students meanwhile also get abridged history styled the same way as the wizard-raised ones, and are taught how to write with quills, what to say and what not to say, how to avoid offending their fellow students and their parents, and finally how to use the floo, portkeys and how to handle a broom at a basic level.

So Home Ec is just Charms and Transfiguration rolled into one?

**** I always imagined Muggle Studies having field trips where they take the kids to McDonalds or a movie theater.

** Regular algebra... I use ab=cd and basic manipulations of such at least once a week, and I can't imagine that would be less true if I were magical. (If a recipe calls for 1/4 cup of chocolate chips per batch and I have an 800g pack of chocolate chips, how many batches can I make? Pureblood wizards have no idea)

History is an important subject and failing to replace Binns is terrible. Getting a real history teacher may have been enough to prevent most of Slytherin from joining Voldemort, and would likely have been enough to get Fudge immediately booted after the events at the beginning of book 5. I don't know the specifics of wizarding history but corruption causing problems and prejudice causing useless wars seem to be pretty universal.

*** Algebra seems basic to me as well. I don't think we realize how much we use it in our daily lives.

**** Astronomy is mandatory through OWL years. That's gotta cover math, shouldn't it?

*** On topic of the history teacher - hiring someone who is able to make history interesting for the kids, and who doesn't shy away or sugarcoat the Death Eaters' crimes, would have made the war a LOT shorter. It may be a little manipulative, but by systematically instilling shock and disgust in the students, anyone who'd maybe join later after a lengthy campaign of desensitisation would not do so.

** Alchemy.

Maybe Wizarding Literature, depends bc it might be covered in History but yeah.

Also PE because of wizards exist we all know they would be fat ducks that can't run 10 seconds without screaming murder

*** I always pictured DADA having a decent amount of physical activity when run by a competent professor.

Saw one fic where the real Moody came back for 5th year. Calisthenics were involved.
