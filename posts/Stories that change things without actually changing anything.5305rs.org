** I think it comes down partly to lack of writing/creative skill, and partly to a subconcious belief that you have to hit the Stations of Canon. As someone who's been there and done that, it can be a hard mindset to break without it being pointed out. Even when you do know you shouldn't hit them, it can be tempting to do it anyway because coming up with new ideas is hard.

** These authors want to see how their change impacts the story. Except instead of seeing how it impacts the plot as a whole, they want to see how it impacts each major event in canon. This produces each of the scenes they want, but it doesn't do as good a job at producing a good story.

That's why my writing tends to share almost no plot points with canon.

** People can tolerate different variations on canon. You have complete stations of canon (Green Eyed Snake) to completely original setting (Alexandra Quick) and people have different ideas on how much innovation they want.

What you should be careful of is trying to write canon events like they're new. Everyone's read the books already, so you should never try to surprise the reader with Fluffy or the basilisk reveal.

** The only rewrites of 1st-3rd year I've liked were in the [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/58157][Stealing Harry series]].

Harry is raised by Remus and Sirius (who are romantically involved. Most of the fics are about Harry and his friends at school so the slash is minor if you're not a fan. Lots of changes from canon, but the main characters still all feel like themselves. It's a great "rewrite."

My biggest criticism is that the author abandoned the series after the third year and left notes on what was going to happen to everyone (better than nothing I guess). It's not that big of a criticism though because a 7 book series at that caliber of writing is a huge undertaking and the fact that she even got 4 done is impressive to me.

** I call that 'slavish adherence to canon stations', one of my biggest pet peeves about fanfictions.

That being said, some canon developments and events would still happen INDEPENDENTLY of how Harry progressed. It's up to an author's ability to develop the plot logically and plausible.

I think *The Accidental Animagus*, linkffn(9863146), did a good job in maintaining the balance between canon stations and different Harry situations. Year 1, 2, and 4 all had similar situations and resolutions as in Books, but also with significant differences.

** Hmm. Okay, I'll try and answer, as an author in a similar position.

Lots of the time, we have an idea for how we want to deal with things at each point in the story, and yes the earlier decisions would impact the later events making them generally less likely. But we still want to have those interaction moments that we had planned out already, so we just ignore the changes which should have cropped up rather than making up new responses.

Say you want Harry to have the sharingan (for some random reason) so now he is super competent and owns all the face, but you also want him to be able to show off in the Triwizard. Well, competent!Harry has memorized all the law books and probably isn't interested in risking his life for no reason so he would just forfeit at the beginning of each challenge rather than compete, so logically he wouldn't get to show off during the Triwizard. So now you have three options: a) don't have Harry compete and sacrifice those sick fight scenes, b) come up with some contrived reason to force him into doing the same things (Dumbledore threatens him with expulsion etc) or, c) have Harry and everyone else still react in the same way despite how different things are in a way that makes no sense.

The best authors usually go with A (but sometimes get criticism for being too AU or ooc). The good authors go with B (and you can tell /how/ good by how creative they are with it). The bad authors go with C, and unfortunately, Fanfic is really intro-level writing so lots of awful people write horrible, horrible sludge that you'll have to wade through to find the diamonds.

I agree that it is quite frustrating, but if we were able to come up with wholly original plot we wouldn't write so much fanfiction. :/

** Alright, it's not a Harry Potter fic, but I'm going to bitch about it anyways. It was a Lord of the Rings/Star Wars crossover (only listed as SW) called The War of the Ring where Obi-Wan Kenobi after Order 66 ends up in Middle Earth. Literally nothing changes. Boromir dies in the exact same way. Frodo still gets stabbed. Gandalf goes down fighting the Balrog. The Fellowship still splits in the exact same way. Literally. Nothing. Changes. Do not read this.

There is no point. Authors write a story around an idea instead of a plot. The idea of the fic you mentioned is the damn title because it's all they've got.

*** It just fascinates me sometimes that so many fanfic writers can consistently and for so long sit down and write 100k--300k+ words of basically nothing. It's like picking up a pen and paper, sitting down, and spending from hundreds to thousands of hours on just copying the contents of a book after book.

Also, I wish there was a wiki project that just listed how unorigial a fanfic's plotline is in regards to canon stations, so you would know right away whether you even want to spend any time reading through it. Like, “1st year: repeating of troll attack, and Philosopher's Stone chapters; 2nd year: repeating of petrifications, their victims, and Chamber of Secrets chapters”, etc.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10612141/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][I literally studied canon to write this M rated story]] but there are huge changes because I decided to follow different characters around. Instead of rewriting Harry's story, why not write from Minerva's point of view? If you want to create a story that agrees with canon without rehashing things, that would be my main advice.
