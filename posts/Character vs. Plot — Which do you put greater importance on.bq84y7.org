It's the age-old fanfic debate. Do you prefer well-written characters or a great plot? Personally, I focus more on the plot when reading/writing. I already know who the characters are, what they like and how they would react to various situations/events, and so do you. Unless it's a seriously canon divergent AU, I like reading a really good plot with new ideas and minimal cliches.

Characters are important too, but unless they are an OC or SI I'm more forgiving if they're a bit OoC.

What do you guys prefer?


** I didn't realize how much I cared about character development, and how little I cared about plot, until I joined a book club (for normal fiction, not fanfic). People would talk about how they were bored by a story and kept waiting for something interesting to happen, and I'd be like, "...are you kidding? I could not put this book down, and I cried when it was over."

I really love that feeling of getting attached to a protagonist, getting in their head and watching their life and their relationships change in interesting ways. Does that sentence even make sense? Whenever I try to articulate what I like about a character-driven story, it always comes out as overly poetic nonsense, like: "I like stories that say something interesting about what it means to be human." But I know I can't be alone, because that's the point of so many good books, movies and plays.

I think that's why I enjoy Marauders stories so much. I always wanted to spend time with these fun, funny, smart, tragic characters who we just got to briefly glimpse in the HP books. I don't really need an overly complicated plot to enjoy a good story.

*** I've never been big on movies, always preferring TV and books, since it allows time to know characters. I often have a hard time coming to like new characters, so a feature length movie isn't always enough to get me emotionally invested. I think a big part of enjoying FF is that I already have an emotional connection to characters when the story begins.

*** I agree. That's why I enjoy Stephen King so much. He just has a way of writing characters that come alive on the page. It's simply amazing how gifted he is. For me, Under the Dome had the best characters. Too bad the ending of that book sucked.

*** Agreed. Good plot emerges naturally from the characters, and concludes in a way that draws the characters' arcs to a satisfying close.

Speaking in general terms to avoid spoilers, this is why so many people are disappointed by season 8 of Game of Thrones. The plot has become divorced from the characters such that it feels like the writers are moving the characters around the board, rather than characters doing things for reasons which make sense within their character arcs.

** Plot in my opinion. Your character might be written by a God himself and I wouldn't care if it's just another canon rehash

** I like character driven plots, I'm a greedy bastard. Having one or the other is nice but I want it all. Without a good plot I'm bored because nothing is happening but without good characters I don't care what's happening because there are no emotional stakes and I'm not invested.

That being said I read Harry Potter fan fiction because I like the characters and the world, so my scrutiny on the characters is actually higher than in other genres. If someone is behaving out of character it better be justified in the story somehow or I'll be annoyed.

** Character and style come first, plot runs a distant third. Don't get me wrong, plot is fantastic when the writer knows what they're doing. But I'm here for the characters and the magic, and I get a particular thrill out of stylistic brilliance - which doesn't necessarily mean pyrotechnics or complex prose. It can be quiet and insightful and full of perfect turns of phrase. Plot is no substitute for those particular pleasures. Plus I've tried too many books and fics that, yes, kept me reading all the way to the end because the author was a whiz at pacing and reasonably clever in their plotting. More often than not, the stories leave me unsatisfied and feeling like I've just consumed a bunch of empty calories. I generally don't pick up another work by those authors.

An author who can combine all three of those things is someone I'll follow into fandoms I have no interest in. I just know I'll read almost anything this person writes.

** I don't think I put much importance on either.

Everything can work, to be fair. Some writers are very, very good at portraying characters (look at LullabyKnell and how everything is so slow. I actually forget the big plot line sometimes because I'm just so into the small things the character is doing, even if it's just a very small detail of a bigger, bigger, plot). Some other writers would take the same amount to depict things in such details and I'll be bored out of my mind. Others are just so talented at creating very unique plots and making it all about the mystery etc. And some find the perfect point between it all.

So, basically, I'm into writers who play to their strengths.

** Plot, but only by a slight bit. If the story even has a bare-bones plot, it's good enough for me. However, if there is just no plot at all, I won't enjoy it regardless of how amazing the characters may be. The exception to this is when the existence of the character /is/ the plot. Eg. different-gender character, different-age character, different-time setting... In those stories, nothing interesting has to happen to keep me hooked, since the setting is interesting enough by itself.

** Characters 100%. I will read totally mundane slice of life, provided the characters and their relationship feel "real". That's one reason I'm so skeptical of so many recommendations in this subreddit - a lot of them are plot-driven rather than character-driven. But I can't bring myself to care about a plot - no matter how "interesting" - if I'm not emotionally invested in how it will affect the characters, their feelings, their relationships, their development, etc. It's also why I usually prefer stories with romance at the core - they're statistically more likely to be about character rather than plot.

** Both are important. For me first I read the plot. The plot needs to be interesting and inventive. If it's a used plot then a twist is very important. If I like the plot then I start reading to see if the MC evolve through the story. Sometimes it doesn't really happen but I like the feeling of the story, so I finish it. The same case goes for when the plot is a bit bring but those descriptions of characters are the best. I don't really care if the MC are OoC or like in the canon and if the Story follows canon or not. Because some of the are for me really masterpieces like:

** I guess a bit of both. I would say I have a little preference for the plot (I love reading about new situations or discover new way to deal with canon problems), but seeing a OOC character acting exactly like in Canon is one on the most infuriating things I have ever seen (like a Blood Purist Harry raised by Voldemort or worst, Bellatrix that somehow still befriend Hermione because "she is intelligente" and still kill the troll in the loo to saver her because reasons).

** Both are important but if I had to be choose, it'd be characters.

A weak story can be saved by having great characters and I'm more likely to read through because I care about them and want to know more about them.

I've backed off a lot of fics with a promising plot because the characters were so insufferable it just didn't seem worth it.

** Honestly character is much more important. Almost all books follow a similar plot structure.

Something like The call to adventure Refusal to call Meeting the mentor Crossing the first threshold Belly of the whale The road of trials The meeting with the goddess The woman as temptress Atonement of the father Apotheosis The ultimate boon Return The magic flight Rescue from without Return threshold Master of two worlds Freedom to live

These are widely considered ‘the hero's journey” and it's only the characters that actually make it interesting.
