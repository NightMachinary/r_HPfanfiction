****** You've got to take that fic for what it is. If you go to see a Bond movie, you're not going for the philosophical themes or the compelling characters. You're going for 90 minutes of action sequences, witty one-liners, and sex.

** When I saw "NO GREENGRASS" I had a thought - was wondering if anyone else who isn't a fan of her wrote a fic which offs her with the troll in year 1?

Personally I actually quite like what the fandom has done with her, but I'm still curious.

*** That fic would be surprisingly difficult because only due to the troll incident Harry and Hermione became friends and she was the one who did by far the most for Harry. So now you need a satisfactory way to help Harry or you just fucked over the magical world.

Of course you could simply have Daphne gored before the troll gets to Hermione and some of her brain and blood still sticking to the club but then she's just a random background character getting killed within three lines.

**** I think a slytherin Harry wouldn't need the help of a mudblood. He will be able to work for himself not the idiot canon Harry and even if a helpful friend will have been good it will be Theodore Nott, Blaise Zabini or Draco Malfoy.

***** Considering the only things a Malfoy succeeded in are procreation, bribery and several crimes I do not see how they would help Harry in any way. Narcissa, as a distant aunt could perhaps do something, but she was not born a Malfoy.
