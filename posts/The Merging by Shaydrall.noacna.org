Anyone know the pairing? Plus please lend me your opinions on this fanfiction.


** Good one , multiple pairing but not harem, won't regret too much if you can stomach a little overpowered Harry.

*** Same here.. I remember a vague subplot involving Narcissa and the personification of Hogwarts, the rest is a typical super!Harry blur.

***** I was disappointed that he didn't end up with Tonks. There's probably a few spoilers here.

  When the dementor attack presents Harry with an opportunity to begin to fight back he gladly sets himself on the path to have a hand in his future. But as time goes on, it's clear that not all is the same as it once was. Why has his scar stopped hurting? What are these seemingly random objects he's drawn to? How deep does the connection between him and Voldemort truly run? Post GoF
