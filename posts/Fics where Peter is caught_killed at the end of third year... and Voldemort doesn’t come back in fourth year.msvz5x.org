One thing that bothers me about a lot of fics is that even if Peter is prevented from finding Voldemort and helping him with the ritual to get his body back, someone else just ends up taking his place and the whole triwizard/resurrection thing happens without any other changes.

I'm looking for fics where that doesn't happen. Where Peter never finds Voldemort, and things turn out differently.


** Prince of Slytherin maybe.

*** No, definitely not??

The “prologue” (is it still a prologue if it's a jump forward?) specifically mentions Voldemort being revived at the end of the Tri Wizard Tournament, which is happening in 4th year. Additionally, Peter Pettigrew is definitely still at large (at least for the moment).
