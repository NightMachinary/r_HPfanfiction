***** It's actually mood, not tense.

If I was - indicative mood

If I were - subjunctive mood

Both of them are in the past /tense/. The difference between the two moods is that the subjunctive is used to show greater distance from reality, emphasising the hypothetical nature of the statement, whereas the indicative is for factual statements.
