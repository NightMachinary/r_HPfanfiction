:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Pretty much what the title says, it took place when the Order where cleaning the Black family house. I'm pretty sure I read it on ao3 but I'm not a 100% sure.

I'm you know what fic I'm talking a about I would really appreciate it if you would post a link in the comments.


** I think that's like, a solid 30% of hp fanfics, so that doesn't narrow it down too much. Do you remember anything else?

*** Unfortunately not, it was a one shot and it was pretty short. I read it a few years ago.

*** I hate that my brain allows me to remember the plot and insane random details about everything I've read, but no titles or authors.
