:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Its a female Harry Potter fic, pretty sure on archive of our own but I could be wrong. It's not complete and the last few updates I read had Harry in second year, winter break-ish. Also there was something about brewing a required potion (Draught of Sparta or something like that) and it involved capturing the heart of an autumn storm (catching the last drop of rain, then drinking a potion and casting a spell to turn it into a jewel or smth). If anyone knows this fiction and can tell me the title it would be very appreciated, thanks
