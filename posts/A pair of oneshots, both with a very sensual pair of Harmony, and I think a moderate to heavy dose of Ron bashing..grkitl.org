If I remember right I think they were still in there Hogwarts years, and the difference between the two pairs is that one was from the POV of Harry and the other Hermione. Actually now that I think harder it may have been light ron bashing.

**** The thing is, a Harmony couple possessive of each other with some Ron bashing correspond to like 80% of the stories featuring this ship. The only "usefull" info is the date, but ever there, Harmony was already a very popular ship in the early 2010's and there are tens of fic that correspond these criterias.

***** You seriously think there are that many pair of Harmony romance themed one-shots, one from Harry's perspective, one from Hermione's? Because I can think of exactly one such pair of one-shots I came accross in the 19 years I have read HP fanfiction. The one linked in this thread. This request is more specific than 99% of the other "Whats that fic?" requests on this sub.
