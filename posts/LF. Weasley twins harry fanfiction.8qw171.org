Romantic or platonic relationship

Any length fanfiction

Any rating

Good grammar

Preferably no Hermione and Ron hate. Unless it's a really good story.


** When I first read the title of this post I thought you meant the Weasley twins writing/reading in-universe Boy-Who-Lived RPF fanfiction - which really does seem like something they might do. ;b

** My favorite is a GeorgexOC called Painting It, Black on Fanfiction.net Author does a good job weaving the main story without having the OC take Hermione or Rons lines which bugs me a lot. Grammar is acceptable, a slip up or two but its rare. Hope you enjoy!
