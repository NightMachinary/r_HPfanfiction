This is my first post and I was wondering if you guys could help me out with some ideas for my fanfic? In my story a young girl comes from a long line of powerful dark witches and wizards (her ancestor being Harpo the Foul) and have written down their most powerful and dark spells and potions in a secret book. The problem is that I've been having trouble thinking of dark spells that are not to OP but still powerful and evil. Do you guys have any ideas?


** Complete loss of all senses and motor funktions combined with a sugar rush.

**** My guess would be the commenter would have the person all jacked up on sugar and no way to safely "lose" the energy because of the senses being lost and no motor control. So bumping, banging, falling etc into everything until all that sugar is gone from your system.

**** I was thinking along the line of your brain getting kicked into overdrive. Your mind is highly alert, ready to interpret and react to any sensation, only there is nothing for it to work with. Combine that with an already panicked state from the sensual deprivation and you start to imagine worse and worse scenarios, start to haluscinate as your thoughts are your only reality right now. Your only escape would be to fall asleep, but you can't because you are full of adrenaline.

It doesn't have to be a literal sugar rush. Just a similar effect.

***** Reminds me of a story I heard from my old OM who was in the army. They used to carry essentially really powerful epi-pens, designed to give you a surge of adrenaline that could keep you going if you were severely injured/dying and were trying to get to safety. From what I heard if someone in their quarters really pissed everyone off they stick them with one of the pens before they went to be so they wouldn't be able to sleep due to all the adrenaline.

** A curse that affects the victims emotions. They are cursed to feel the opposite emotion that they're feeling at any and all moments. So they're happy when someone close to then dies, they can only feel anguish when their child is born, they're sad when they're eating their favourite food. You can push this further with people finding enjoyment in hurting others or something like that. Having to deal with logically knowing that what they're doing is wrong but still doing it because they don't want to live a life filled with sadness and anger. And when they finally come to accept and actually enjoy the horrible things they do, have the emotion switch up again and have them feel the disgust towards the things they're doing again, and hating theirselves for it.

Maybe some curse that makes the victim feel like worms are crawling underneath their skin. The victim could become more and more insistent that they can feel the worms crawling inside them, with medical staff saying that there are no actual worms inside them. Till it becomes to much and the victim starts cutting in their own skin where they feel the worms in order to get them out.

A curse that reverses the effect of medical magic. Healers would use more and more magic to heal the randomly appearing wounds on the victim, not knowing that they're at fault.

** “Diabetus Mellitus” Allegedly a curse that causes rapid loss of mind and can result in death, what it really does is triple the victims blood sugar while deactivating their insulin receptors for 15 to 30 minutes

**** Another one is “Diabetus Insipidus”, which nominally causes a long, drawn out death by dehydration but actually just stops the victim from making antidiuretic hormone, which means that the body can't stop the kidneys from filtering out the water we drink.

** The spinning hex (/Versare!/): The victim starts spinning on an imaginary line centered on his/her spine. At lower levels this Is inconvenient and causes you to become sick and dizzy, at higher levels, you Will die a horrific death as the centifugal forces tore your limbs and later the rest of your Flesh out of you...

** It doesn't really fit into the theme but a curse I've been thinking about for a while is a microwave pulse charm. Invisible, causes severe internal burns and fries electronics, needs a very obscure shield charm to block it because the normal one only stops magic and physical damage like shockwaves, but not EM radiation. Goes straight through conjured stone barriers, but can be blocked and even reflected back with metal. Because it's invisible it needs a lot of practice to aim properly. Most of the power of it is that the first targets won't know what they got attacked with, once the enemy knows that you're using it they'll be able to defend against it. I'd imagined it as something a dark Hermione would create, since Herpo probably wouldn't know about electromagnetic waves. It could be something he stumbled across and didn't know how it worked and when it's used in the modern day someone realizes what it's doing and comes up with the conjure a sheet of metal defense.

** NSFW warning:\\
A curse that summons a 12-inch long cock that will target the victim's crotch (if girl) or butt (if boy). The victim would be in a hell lot of pain and would probably bleed a lot too, not to mention the psychological effects after it's over.
