Or if you want to just read the meat of it continue here

"Dumbledore!"

The old man finally paused in response to Snape's outburst. "How much longer do we continue to play this ridiculous game?" Snape stomped across the room and stopped in front of Dumbledore's desk. "Potter and I loathe one another. That is never going to change. If the boy must be educated, why not set the task to Lupin or Moody? Someone he does not despise."

Something in the room changed. A palpable energy charged the air, like the hum of electricity before a lightning strike. In spite of his anger, Snape took half a step back.

"Why do you suppose he hates you so, Severus?" Dumbledore's voice was soft. Dangerous. Like the whisper of an assassin's blade.

Snape threw up his arms in frustration. "We both know very well why he's been made to hate me. The Dark Lord can never suspect the truth, otherwise your plans would be ruined. This is the role you've cast for me, Dumbledore."

The old man's expression remained impassive. "What you're describing, Severus, is a consequence, not a cause. You're more than clever enough to understand the difference. Why does Potter hate you?"

Snape spun around like a petulant youngster, no longer able to stomach the hard blue eyes that saw through him. "He blames me for the death of his parents."

"Shouldn't he?"

The younger man turned back to face the Headmaster, eyes blazing with anger. "That was your failing, Dumbledore. Not mine, yours!" His voice rose to a shout. "I gave you everything. Told you everything. Swore my life to you! On one condition." He pounded his fist against the great, wooden desk. "One condition only! That you would keep them safe!"

Dumbledore continued to regard him with a cold, steely calm. "Keep her safe," he quietly corrected. "You asked me to keep her safe. And once again, you confuse consequence for cause. Why did she require my protection? What compelled you to swear your life to me?" Snape's eyes fell to the floor. After several moments of painful silence, the Headmaster continued. "There's something I want you to know, Severus. I never told her how the Dark Lord came to know of the prophecy." The former Potions Master's head snapped back up, genuine shock filling his normally stony face. "I thought she'd already suffered more than enough anguish on your account."

The old man rose to his feet. His blue eyes burned with barely contained fury. "Lily Potter never knew that the boy she befriended as a little girl was the one who betrayed her to the Dark Lord." Snape fell back several steps, looking stricken, until he bumped into an overstuffed armchair and barely caught himself before he crashed to the floor. "Lily Potter died without knowing that boy tried to sacrifice her family to the Dark Lord in return for her life." Dumbledore slowly made his way around the desk. The air around him crackled with magic. "And Lily Potter rests peacefully without knowing how shamefully that boy has treated her son." 

The Headmaster came to a stop in front of Snape, staring down at him with an expression of pure disgust. "Lily Potter will never have to carry those burdens. But you know how she would have felt about those things, Severus. How she would have felt about you. You know it every time you see her eyes, filled with hatred, on the face of her son. And so long as I'm alive, that is a burden you will never escape." He towered over Snape's cowering form for a few moments longer, eyes boring into the younger man, before turning away to face the window. "You have much to do tomorrow. Leave me. Go back to your dungeons. Sleep, if you're able."

Neither man spoke another word as Severus Snape hurried out of the Headmaster's office.

I love this. If Snape truly was redeemed or had an ounce of the conscience people like to think he had, he would not have had a night without the whispers of the lives he destroyed running through his mind.

As it is, he probably cursed James Potter and thought something demeaning of the young boy who he caused to be orphaned, before sleeping peacefully.

Harry, Hermione, Ron: *What?!!*

Snape's usefulness as a spy is completely negligible. He doesn't have any intel that saves anybody's lives. He can't prevent some of Draco's more bullheaded schemes. He doesn't protect anyone at a school from being target practice. He can't even behave like a spy would - the best spies are the ones you'd least suspect, which is the opposite of Snape.

The only thing he does that's vital is the memory transfer - which is deus ex machina by the author. Those memories could have been transferred in a lot of other different, more fail-safe ways.

The idea that Snape is some sort of "gray" character is absurd.

I can't remember a single worthwhile thing Snape did as a spy. Maybe Draco's plan of killing Dumbledore. But even that doesn't work. Because,

1. Dumbledore was dying anyway.
2. Even Harry figured out that Draco was up to something and knew about the unbreakable vow.
3. Snape couldn't do jackshit to prevent Draco's dangerous schemes that led to two innocent students nearly dying.
4. Snape barely did anything to make the battle at Hogawarts at the end of sixth year less damaging.

You can blame plot contrivance. But that only goes so far.

*** To be fair to Snape, the last book doesn't focus on hogwarts so anything Snape does to help the students wouldn't be mentioned. He probably did help the students in subtler ways. We also never learn how Dumbledore and the order used his intel, since Harry, the narrator, wasn't allowed to have a major role in the order during the books.

Additionally, his grayness has nothing to do with his usefulness to the light and has everything to do with his willingness to switch sides and help the good side. He still was a crappy person and an abusive teacher, but he is still part of the good side.

People do not become the good guys by attending good guy meetings and being part of the good guy club. They actually fight and put their lives on the line to help defeat Voldemort.

Snape cannot do either of these things. He never fights - which is fine since he's supposed to be a spy, there shouldn't be any chance of the Death Eaters recognising him and blowing his cover - so he's supposed to make up for his lack of fighting with his information.

And yet, the Order are caught flat-footed when Amelia Bones is killed, when Hagrid and Maxime visit the giants, when giants attack multiple muggle villages, when Arhur, Bode and Podmore are attacked in the Ministry. He also has no clue about the mass-breakout from Azkaban in Book 5. And then, he turns around and passes information that directly leads to Emmeline Vance's death, and the Seven Potters' debacle, where Mad-eye Moody is killed (someone like Moody would have been invaluable to everyone had he survived).

If he has no information, then he's useless as a spy, and his worth to the Order is next to zero, right next to Mundungus Fletcher.

*** And what, pray tell, do you expect to have happened if Snape had cracked down on the Carrows and forbidden them to torture the students?

Option 1: They accept his reasons at first, but keep grumbling as time passes and the students keep rebelling, making louder and louder noises about the need to "keep them in line" and "make them know their place." There's a very good chance that this actually happened.

Option 2: Voldemort intervenes and puts the Carrows in charge of policy. Things get much worse than canon, very quickly. By the time the Golden Trio arrive, there is no rebel army to speak of; they've mostly been killed or abducted. Without the privileges of being the Headmaster, Snape quite possibly never manages to deliver the Sword of Gryffindor, nor inform Harry that he's a Horcrux. Voldemort wins.

Option 3: Snape openly rebels before everything is ready. A bunch of Death Eaters die, but so do all the non-evil teachers. Voldemort takes personal control of the school and kills off dissent even more thoroughly than option 2. The Diadem is never destroyed (along with several other Horcruxes). Voldemort wins.

Option 4: Voldemort takes Snape's side, and replaces the Carrows with more intelligent and subtle Death Eaters. Harry's return to the school is much more difficult, possibly even resulting in his capture. Final outcome uncertain, but with a better chance of Voldemort winning than canon. Also, this option is unlikely to happen.

Not sure if you haven't read the books properly or not, but the Death Eaters take a lot of care not to kill purebloods in Book 7. There are several examples of this -

Ted and Andromeda Tonks' home is attacked by Death Eaters, who know that the real Harry Potter landed there. Remus and Tonks, who is pregnant with a half-werewolf, are unharmed. They were tortured for information, but not killed.

Arthur Weasley, who Voldemort knows is part of the Order, is seen working at the Ministry and being in good health. Same goes for Bill, who they know to be part of the Order.

Xenophilius Lovegood, who openly prints pro-Potter propaganda, is not killed. Luna is kidnapped, but she isn't harmed. I can't imagine any violent regime where people spreading propaganda against the state are allowed to live, but hey, that's the Death Eaters for you, I guess.

Fred and George, who ran U-No-Poo a year before, aren't harmed.

So if the Carrows are put in charge of the school, nothing changes, seeing as they're not killing purebloods or halfbloods, and there are no muggleborns in the school thanks to the Registration Committee. The students were tortured before, they still get tortured, nothing changes.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

The deliverance of the sword is another example of deus ex machina. It could have been done in a lot of other ways. The only reason she did it the way she did is to try and get Snape some time in the spotlight and highlight his "love". And to make things as difficult for the trio as possible.

#+begin_quote
  Option 3: Snape openly rebels before everything is ready.
#+end_quote

Seeing that Dumbledore tells Snape that Voldemort can't be killed before Harry dies, I can't see Snape doing this.

#+end_quote

Neville is speaking in present tense, so this didn't happen.

Option 1 would have been most likely had Snape put his foot down. Voldemort made Snape the headmaster, not the Carrows, and he did so because Snape is way higher up the Death Eater pecking order. The Carrows answer to Snape, not the other way around. Even Voldemort listens to Snape from time to time.

Yeah, he says this in July 1997. Tonks is killed in May 1998.

The Death Eaters know where she lives as she's a Ministry employee. They even capture the Tonks family in August, so they had ample time to "prune the family of its rotten parts". That's about ten months they had the chance to "prune the branches" that they didn't do it.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

There is this thing called delegation of power, I wonder if you've heard of it. Voldemort delegates powers to his underlings, because he can't run an entire country by himself. When he assigns positions to his Death Eaters, he expects them to run their posts as they see fit, so long as it comes under his overall vision.

He delegates the Muggleborn commission to Yaxley. He delegates Hogwarts to Snape. Yaxley runs the commission with a certain degree of autonomy - Voldemort would prefer all muggleborns killed, but we see muggleborn beggars in Diagon Alley.

The same thing applies to Snape. Snape can run Hogwarts whichever way he wants to, so long as it is within Voldemort's greater vision of what the school should be.

#+begin_quote
  we see snape agreeing to protect the students, we see him assigning ginny & co. detention with hagrid
#+end_quote

I often see this example touted as though it is some sort of shining example of Snape's magnanimity, as though it is supposed to excuse the fact that dozens of students were hiding away from the rest of the school out of fear of torture, and that unforgivables were practiced on eleven year olds.

In any case, Hagrid fled for his life a few months after the school re-opened and lived in a cave for most of that year.

What's more the students' own view of Snape was crystal clear - they cheered when they heard that Snape ran away before the battle. That should be an indicator about what they thought of Snape and his "subtle protections".

#+begin_quote
  claiming that stopping the carrows was as easy as snape 'putting his foot down' but he chose not to is absurd lol

No it isn't. With most militaristic hierarchies, even one as crude as the Death Eaters', orders demand obedience. Disobedience in militarised organisations generally involves severe punishment - in this case, the same methods of the Death Eaters.

Yes, but given enough provocation, they'll still do it. Luna was pureblood and was still kidnapped. Neville had to hide out in the Room of Requirement or face the same thing, and eventually any rebellious students had to join him.

** The Scourge from the North by DogheadThirteen is an excellent read, with a more subtle approach to this trope.

From the first chapter:

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore sighed and shook his head slightly.

  “I confess Severus can be difficult,” he said.

  “He's an arsehole, Sir, and it's getting more and more tempting to do something drastic.”

  “Please don't; he's quite useful to me, both on a personal and professional level. I'm sure that as you develop the political base we're both well aware that you're working on, you will find yourself possessed of servants most people strongly dislike, but who are important to your plans... As Severus aptly demonstrates every time he opens his mouth, desirable skills and likeable personality do not inevitably go hand-in-hand.”

  “Teaching isn't one of his skills, Sir.”

  “Indeed. We'll need to do a certain amount of... housekeeping before I'm able to move him to a less people-oriented position; the likes of Lucius Malfoy have a great deal of influence, political and financial, and are a large part of the reason Severus is where he is. They like their spoilt brats having a teacher in their back pocket.”

** Well, to be fair, he knew that Voldemort wouldn't let Harry survive because of the prophecy. And James defied Voldemort three times (Lily did as well), but he's also a marauder. I can only imagine what he did to Voldemort and his pride. Also, James was Severus's bully; would you have saved your childhood bully who married your crush? So, really, the only person Snape had a hope of saving was Lily, and that was only because Voldemort acknowledged that Snape was loyal and did a good job, so he needed a reward. So, even though Snape was not inherently good or bad, we can't form an opinion of him only based on this.

I'm so sick of seeing this as a defense for Snape not caring that a literal infant was about to be murdered because of him: Harry being killed was /always/ a part of Snape's plan, he just didn't know that it was Harry specifically whom Voldemort would target. Even then, he wouldn't've cared if that hadn't put Lily in danger, too. Snape was outright confused when Dumbledore called him out on this, because he sincerely did not understand that what he did wrong /wasn't/ inadvertently endangering Lily specifically.

What he did wrong was tell mass murderer who wanted to overthrow the government and replace it with a genocidal autocracy where to find the one person who could stop his rise to power.
