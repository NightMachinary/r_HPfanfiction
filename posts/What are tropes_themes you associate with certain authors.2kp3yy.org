**** In a typical example, Harry's love interest will have /zero/ interests that conflict with Harry's, and she'll rarely have any that are orthogonal. I totally agree that keeping your friend alive and thwarting a terrorist organization would be major overriding motivations, but you should have something to occupy you the rest of the time. Some goals for after killing Voldemort.

I've seen, for instance, Hermione Granger curing lycanthropy. But not when she was dating Harry. I've seen her fighting for mudblood rights. But only when she was single. I've seen her become an animagus -- but I've never seen her beat Harry to it, and I've never seen her try unless Harry was also up for it.

They are allowed to have outside concerns that prove to be vulnerabilities that Harry can fix. If Harry's dating Daphne Greengrass, maybe her father is abusing her, or maybe her uncle is a Death Eater and attacking the family, and Harry can come in and save everyone.

But, yeah, this sounds about right. Once in a while, you might get a fic where they are a partnership of more-or-less equals and have a common goal that dominates all other objectives, but independent goals and interests? Heaven forbid!

This isn't unique to /Harry Potter/, now that I think about it. There really ought to be a subtrope of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chickification][Chickification]] that concerns specifically the instances of tough, capable, proactive female characters who often take charge in a situation being stripped of resilience and initiative (and, often falling behind in terms of capability as well) as soon as they fall in love with the male lead, to whom they increasingly begin deferring.

I'm not certain, but I believe it was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4776976/1/The-Problem-with-Purity][The Problem with Purity]], featuring the HMS Guns 'n' Handcuffs and the HMS Prudence & Potions. Not an awesome story overall, but I find it amusing that the author actually looked up times and dates for peak full-moon-ness, resulting in some interesting scheduling.

**** The only one I can think of off the top of my head that is not a one-shot and is reasonably well-written is [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/7700][Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire]] by Couldston Eagle, where Hermione's name comes out of the Goblet.

A close one is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8823447/][Harry Potter and the Witch Queen]] by TimeLoopedPowerGamer, which takes the dynamic of many HP/HG fics where Hermione's sole function other than a romantic partner is to facilitate Harry becoming a more powerful wizard, and reverses it. However, Harry is a time-traveling veteran with untreated PTSD and Hermione is a Dumbledore-grade prodigy, so it's a bit too AU to be categorized.

If [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/Reign-of-the-Serpent][Reign of the Serpent]] by AlphaEph19 ends up being HP/HG, then it will be another example: Harry wants his family's position in The System restored; Hermione just wants to burn the whole thing down.

Dumbledore has a whole speech at the end of OotP precisely about that. So, yes, Harry is Chosen by the most evil character in canon.

Worse yet, the prophecy came from Trelawney, the flakiest character in canon, and it was conveyed by Snape, the second most untrustworthy character in canon.

So, I guess what I'm sayin' is that every time you call Harry "the Chosen One", you are endorsing evil, flakiness, and treachery. :P

I keep wanting to read a good multi relationship/harem fic - each one I've tried so far had some big turn off for me.

It's either MC becomes overpowered and the rest of the fic is just girls swooning and enemies "provoking" fights they never stand a chance... or the fic contains so much bashing and Harry is center of attention because he is literally the only guy who is not a bigoted monster... or the bane of all fun - aka babies and pregnancies become the focus of the story...

I haven't read your fics yet, but even if they don't turn to be to my taste, just based on your "issue" - really glad authors like you exist.

**** You ever tried reading the Firebird series by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1229909/Darth-Marrs][Darth Marrs]]?

He writes a total rework of the HP world in which the magical world is matriarchal where witches outnumber wizards almost six to one, and the wizards are treated as chattel. There are a lot more details that are changed such as many gender bent characters, vastly different wand lore, magical physiology, and goblin origin. Darth has already finished the first two stories in the trilogy and has posted 20 chapters of the final part. Give it a try.

***** I've read book one just as it came out - enjoyed it very much for the world building. Characters were too young for the relationships to start but a huge potential is there.

I liked that the author is taking it slow, but resolved not to keep reading until he actually gets to the romance/relationship parts or is done with the story - I binge read and it's simply torture for me to to read unfinished stories one chapter per week.

Can you give me a hint on whether it's time to revisit that story?

P.S. I understand fully about the binge reading, if I get to the end of a story and it's not finished I wait for 3-4 more chapters to come out then read the whole thing over again.

***** There is a paterfamilias for each established family who, it is implied, controls the family. Lord Malfoy is powerful politically. Dumbledore formed a coven rather than having one formed on him. Names follow the male line of descent.

Overall it reads like a patriarchal society that was forced to give some women power due to population dynamics. Or maybe an attempt to write a matriarchal society by someone who has no idea how to escape patriarchy.

Edit: it starts looking ever so slightly more egalitarian around chapter 10, but it still doesn't look matriarchal.
