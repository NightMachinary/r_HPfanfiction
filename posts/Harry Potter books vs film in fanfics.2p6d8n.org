Which popular ideas in fanfics do you think come from the books, which from the films?

Snape's character in fanfics is heavily influenced by his portrayal in the film, imo. I think many fanfic writers with a somewhat likeable or good looking Snape base their idea of his character on the image they got from watching the films, not from the descriptions we got in the books.

The elder wand is an example where the opposite is true. In my experience many writers prefer the book solution (placing it in Dumbledore's tomb ) over the film solution (breaking it). I guess the book solution is more popular because Harry can retrieve the elder wand later on and it can be included in the story that way.

Which popluar ideas do you think come from the films, which from the books? And: When you read about werewolves, do you picture them like we saw them in the films?

*** Yeah, Snape's character was portrayed very well, Alan Rickman did a great job, but I just think the actor was better looking than the Snape in the books. No greasy hair, no yellow uneven teeth... and I think it's with the actor's image in mind that Snape became such a popular character. I mean take all the "Snape is Harry's father" fics. I can imagine Lily falling for someone like Alan Rickman's Snape. Dark, mysterious and good looking in his own way. It's harder for me to imagine the same with book Snape. It's the same with Emma Watson. She's way better looking than JK imagined Hermione. She said so herself in interviews. So all these fanfics where Hermione is this beautiful young woman instead of a nerdy bookworm are more based on the films than on the books. I too imagine someone as good looking as Emma Watson when I read about Hermione. I never think of her as the 'ugly duckling'. Of course it makes sense that they cast more attractive actors, they had movie tickets to sell.

I agree about Ginny. Never thought about it concerning her character before, but it makes sense that the way she's portrayed in fanfics is influenced by Bonnie Wright's acting.

This is very evident in any H/NotR fic as there's a whole spiel about how much more attractive she is than Ron. These oddly seem to use book Ron as well.

**** to be fair, Hermione is physically described when she is 11. Then the assumption is that she happened to be that one girl on the planet who doesn't change much as she undergoes puberty for some reason.

Hermione in first movie basically stepped out of the book as far as I am concerned - and Rowling, being the creator of the character, probably fell into the same trap that many parents do, as in having a hard time to transition mental image of the character with age - after all, unlike most parents she didn't have a physical, visible proof of that transition to help her adjust.

**** Fwiw, tho obviously Emma Watson is model-hot, it's clear Hermione gets much better looking; Harry thinks she's very pretty st the Yule Ball, Krum finds her and Ginny both equally attractive, and in her sixth year, Hermione has no problem getting Cormac to agree to go to Slughorn's party with her. She knew Smith would have, too. So it's reasonable that she's pretty good-looking.

*** Rickman does a great job, but the only thing is Snape is supposed to be at most, early 30s, in Harry's first year. And Rickman was pushing 60 in that role (believe it or not).

**** The problem wasn't so much that Snape wasn't in his thirties, they aged up a lot of adults which makes sense. It was more that none of the characters that were aged up were played by actors that were a roughly similar age. Snape supposed to be the same age as Remus and Sirius starts to stretch the imagination a bit when the actors playing Remus and Sirius are a good 15 years younger.

** Ron the Death Eater definitely comes more from the films. Its very easy to dismiss Ron's character in fanfic (especially H/Hr or Hr/OC) when the films basically upped Hermione's competency in every area and reduced Ron to 'likes eating, scared of things, is lazy, betrays Harry in 2/8 films'. Where Ron and Harry fell out in the books there was a lot of Ron-Harry friendship moments to balance these out; as well as scenes and moments explaining why Ron might feel overshadowed; the films just portrayed him as a bit of a jealous dick for no reason and also as if he was Harry's 'best friend' by default given Harry's abusive childhood and the fact that their other year-mates weren't fleshed out as much.

I also think Harry/Luna ships surged in popularity after the films' portrayal of the characters (especially OOTP) and Neville/Luna ships as well for that matter - which still seem to me very much like Pair the Spares.

** I was miffed that they broke it in the movies. Sure it makes more of a visual impact, but its doesn't make any sense. Surely if it could literally be broken that way, there was at least /one/ power-hungry wizard in the long list of power-hungry wizards who had a caring and intelligent family who tried?! You can't just break death's hold like that!

**** I've had such a theory for awhile now. Harry's wand "learned" from Voldemort's during Priori Incantatem in the graveyard and then his holly wand "learned" from the Elder wand when he repaired it.

It therefore stands to reason that even though he broke the wand (which I actually prefer over the books) Harry is still in possession of the most powerful wand. BOOM! A plausible way to have superpower!Harry.

Someone needs to write it because I can't finish anything I start.

Hem.

I would have vastly, greatly, vastly, massively preferred a movie version of it being taken to his tomb ("But decaying body!" = "Magic, suckers! - he looks perfect with his beard even now.").

Instead he snapped it like a twig and chucked it off a bridge or something. I mean - I can't even remember it, such was the lack of visual impact.

Gah!

**** I know what you're saying, and it's definitely more artistic the way you're describing it; /however/ Harry Potter, for people who haven't grown up with it and loved the story before the movies, having the Elder Wand snapped is a recognizable and satisfying trope. Kind of like "this silly thing caused so many problems" Mean Girls style. People like that. I can see why they went with it for a summer blockbuster.

***** Blah!

I'd rather have my child (in the future) have seen him stow away the wand, place a fake one in the tomb, and say some soppy thing to Hermione like, /this shit is powerful - but I won't let it corrupt me, just as it didn't corrupt Dumbledore, and it will be a weapon against darkness.../

Thus my child learns that power has its place in society, but only the fools and bastards of the world use it badly - and that the unassuming Harry Potter had hidden the largest power of them all; but didn't use it - not even letting it be known he had it...

Crack!

Credits roll and the Hogwarts quote comes up "Never Tickle a Sleeping Dragon"
