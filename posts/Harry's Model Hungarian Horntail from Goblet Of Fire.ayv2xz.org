The dragon was never mentioned again, which is quite a lost opportunity, therefore I am asking if you know of any fanfictions or One Shots where it isn't forgotten. A simple explanation would be also enough.


** I think I once read a fic where he kept it, and a couple of the other champions didn't want theirs, so he kept those as well. /No idea/ how to go about finding it though.

Seconded, I'm also interested in this. Mini-dragons are awesome. I know I'd want to keep it if it were me.

*** There was one... I think I've read the fic you have but I can't remember it's name. I know that there's a mentor!Salazar_Slytherin fic where Harry uses a time turner and leaves himself a hint about using the mini-dragon against the real one. It's one of those fics where Harry has skillz in transfiguration and transfigured his lungs and airways to give himself real gills. Gets right into the details too.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** My head canon: Dobby had hoarded Harry Potter junk the same way Kreacher had hoarded Black Family heirlooms. Somewhere in the smallest dormitories of Hogwarts there is a Harry Potter shrine with a broken sneak-o-scope, some chocolate frog wrappers, an empty vial that once held lucky potion, and a scrap of parchment with “Mrs Cho Potter” in a heart. The horntail model would be there too.
