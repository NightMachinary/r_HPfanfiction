** Well, there's this one, though it's just a short one-shot and Harry doesn't appear outside a brief mention... But Death is great in it!

  Another "Voldemort Meets Discworld's Death" story. Written for the Spacebattles forum, shouldn't be taken too seriously.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

** Damn, I read one just the other day that had the Death of the Discworld in it. I can go looking if you like - it's Snape that becomes Death while Himself goes on holiday, though, so I'm not sure if you'll like it...
