** If I'm going to be completely honest, it's a difficult fic for the reason that it takes awhile to update. I really get it though, life gets n the way, writersblock may occur and it simply takes time to keep up the quality.

That said, it's difficult to keep following the story because of the gaps in updating gets me out of it; I usually have to reread acouple of chapters ebery time to remember where the story was.

However I'm still really glad that it's updated and hopefully soonI'll have the time to get invested again and maybe reread it from the beginning

*** Yeah, I get what you mean. I had to reread the story 3 times, due to the slow updates, before I remembered what happened and didn't have to reread it every time. Still, I genuinely believe it's worth it. The characterisation is on point. Literally every single person has a personality, even Ron has one, which is super difficult and very rare in Post-Hogwarts fics, in fics in general to be honest.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

** Also thank any moderator who didn't want a second thread on this topic.. even though I was talking about a totally different thing. This was not an update thread, it was a discussion thread... Goddamn it... I got only 1 response from someone who actually had some criticism about the story, due to it's slow update speed. Why was it so bad to have 2 different threads, which had 2 different goals?
