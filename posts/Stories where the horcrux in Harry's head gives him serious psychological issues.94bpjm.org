I really like the idea of Harry getting Voldemort's memories but don't want to see it treated like an instant level-up. Are there any good fics exploring just how messed up it would be for a child to see into the mind of a murderous psychopath? Maybe Harry suffering from ptsd or having trouble separating his own identity from Voldemort. Or even a serious version of the Seventh Horcrux.


** Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux:

linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11762850/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Accidental-Horcrux]]) A serious version of Harry's horcrux awakening and influencing him. It does a good job of showing how Harry's personality is shaped over time as he and Voldemort are both stuck with one another.

Summary:

#+begin_quote
  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** What Lies Beneath by Master Slytherin ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3688693/1/What-Lies-Beneath]]) fits your description for the most part. With each Horcrux destroyed Lord Voldemort gains a greater hold over Harry. This is honestly a really enjoyable read that does a great job of balancing Harry's character with the influence of Voldemort upon him.

Edit: Since the bot isn't working I'll give you the summary

COMPLETE. The diary left more than battle wounds. Voldemort's ingenuity planned for more than Harry initially assumed. The time has come when he must pierce the shades of grey that colour the Wizarding World. A fast-paced, psychological thriller

** Maybe something like this?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9040382/1/Psychosis]]

Summary:

When Harry was hit by the killing curse, a horcrux was created. In this story, Harry is affected by the piece of Voldemort's soul inside his head in a more noticable way than in the books. Muggles, not knowing any better, decide he must be mentally ill. What effects might the treatment on a psychiatric ward have for the boy-who-lived and the wizarding world?

** Here are a few fics like that that I have enjoyed. Sadly, both of them seem to be dead.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3343148/1/Strange-Likenesses][Strange Likenesses]] - (7 chapters, 17k+ words) Voldemort tries to posses young Harry rather than drift for years in the forests of Albania. He does not succeed. The mental barriers keeping Voldemort contained finally fall at the end of Harry's first year at Hogwarts, leaving both of them to face the consequences. linkffn(3343148)

In my opinion the author of "Strange Likenesses" does a great job describing the self-destructive internal conflict between Harry and Voldemort, as well as the existential horror of being trapped so intimately with your greatest enemy.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11126088/1/My-Dark-Passenger][My Dark Passenger]] - (8 chapters, 40k+ words) That night in Godric's Hollow played out differently. Lilly Potter died to protect her children from Voldemort, but with his death the Dark Lord left a piece of himself inside the 8 year old Harry Potter. James Potter doesn't know how to cope with suddenly having two young children to care for by himself, especially since Harry has started to act out in disturbing ways. linkffn(11126088)

"My Dark Passenger" is a serious exploration of the aftermath for a young child who has witnessed his mother's violent death. Aside from grappling with the frightening new truth of his parents' mortality, Harry struggles to contain the darker urges from his new 'passenger'.

*** "My Dark Passenger" definitely sounds like a Dexter crossover.

***** I suppose "crossover" wasn't the most accurate term I could have used but I do like the idea of exploring that part of Harry's life (Potter not Morgan haha). I could definitely see the stories that could arise from the concept like Harry Potter living a double life in which he stalks and kills Death Eaters.

****** I agree that would make for a great story. I wish that Malevolent Mind, the fic author, would continue where they left off.
