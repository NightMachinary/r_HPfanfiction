*** Harry, though appealing on a basic level to most readers is basically passive. And remains so, limiting character growth.

***** A lot of people want a heroic hero, and also want the story's hero. And the trend in lot of fiction (with obvious exceptions) is to have a flawed or otherwise 'handicapped' protagonist. Because that speaks to the reader in a better sense.

It's an interesting contradiction that I think the authors and publishers actually misconstrue in books where the world the characters play in has become a character in its self.

You can inhabit the fantastic (and underdeveloped) Wizarding world in HP OR keep it in the 'real world' of Twilight and add fantastic elements. We respond to that very well, and not necessarily respond the characters. However it's the characters that drive the novel. So they keep the hero as they are and we the public want to see it better.

As far as Anything!Harry goes, it's a world where magic exists and there are varying levels of power. Just like there are various levels of the mind among muggles. So we identify and imagine.

I definitely wanted Harry to grow and inhabit the image of a golden child who defeats evil after trials and tribulations because he learned and toiled. Possibly even scrapping the win barely, possibly at a significant cost. Then he'd learn to deal with life after the fact.

Instead we got an almost flat character who killed evil with an elementary school spell.

****** What surprises me then, is how many people are interested in Harry here, either as a hero or in a pairing. Specifically here in this subreddit because it's the only HP place I frequent where anyone is interested in this kind of story at all. Of course, everyone has different tastes, but I was very surprised at its popularity.

To me, though Harry is basically a reader insert, he suits the purposes of the book. It seems like many revisionist stories focus on the magic or being grittier when HP isn't about who's got the bigger spells nor Harry's singular efforts. I've got plenty to gripe about still, since I think the last bit of the war focuses too much on Harry and I want more battle scars on everyone, but I like that Voldemort dies in such an ordinary way. The movie DH has the worst ending, with Voldemort turning into butterfly dust after a nonsensical spell fight. He should die like he does in the books--as Tom Riddle.

Much of the spirit of the book for me is in the ordinariness of the heroes and villains, of how many of these villains exist as regular authority figures--professors, government officials, your schoolmate's prejudiced parents, and so on.

*** I think some of it comes from wanting to make it like a "legend", where Harry has this great ancestry (not talking about him being an heir of ALL the founders)... but like Potters always fighting for the good. So it becomes like an epic battle of good vs. evil. Though I am super picky about which ones I read because so often it turns into old man Dumbles being this psychotic man child and not an actual sane individual.

Bobmin356 wrote a fantastic one called "Sunset over Britain" and it's sequel "Sunrise over Britain". Both on fanficauthors.net. What most people fall prey to I think, is they make Harry overpowered to the point of removing any sort of tension. They also dont make it the focus of the story, rather let things develop naturally and have there be a challenge to all this.

So, she thought that it was a bad idea to wander around an unfamiliar magic castle at night over a matter of pre-adolescent honor. Burn the conformist!

As for the summer before OotP, Voldemort had just resurrected himself /using Harry's blood/, so it wasn't clear how much of his mother's protection was still in effect, not until much later. Clearly, prioritizing operational security over Harry's feelings was a profound act of unjustified obedience to authority. (That said, Dumbledore should have probably warned Harry and explained more things to him; but that has nothing to do with Hermione's character.)

- Harry brooding at the Dursleys, making various "realisations" about Dumbledore/the Weasleys/the author's hated characters of choice.

- Visit to Gringotts. Inheritance of Lordships, loads of money, marriage contract(s).

- Massive shopping trip.

- A summer of "training" and sex with harem.

- Confrontation with Dumbledore in which Harry rants a lot.

- Fic abandoned.

It's sort of like DADA curse in HP but this one is in real life and rather then killing or getting rid of people it instead condemns thousands of teens to write the same story again and again.

There is an inherent understanding for all fans of this branch of HP fandom, that if one manages to write a good fic in it, the curse will be dispelled. So people keep trying.

Readership enjoyment depends on the same mental state as fans of loser sport teams who wait decades for their team to get a win. Until that win, just enough nourishment to persevere is provided by the harem sex - the idea of it, not the actual scenes - because they are written by teens/young adults with no imagination who usually just pussyfoot around it or write utterly boring, vanilla scenes when they do manage to write it.

(seriously, who the hell would get a harem just to take turns to have sex with each soul/contract bonded wife/concubine sequentially?)

*** I'll try to give a couple explanations about why I enjoy SS/HG fics.

For some people, myself included, the teacher/student thing is a turn-on rather than being squicky. Would I ever actually date a man so much older than me or a man who was my teacher? No, probably not. I'm definitely not alone though in having taboo schoolgirl fantasies. At the very least, authors point out that Hermione would have been eighteen during her final year. Have to draw the line somewhere!

Also, I've read quite a few AU fics that take place once Hermione is in her 30s and I feel like those are less 'creepy.' My step-dad is 13 years older than my mom and that doesn't gross me out - probably because my mom was already in her 40s when they met. Another common rationalization for the age difference between Snape and Hermione is that twenty years doesn't matter so much when wizards/witches could live well past 100.

The SS/HG ship is also overflowing with timeturner fics. So. Many. It's a little overdone, but there are also some really good ones. Hermione usually trips or gets knocked over while using the timeturner, sending her back to when the Marauders were at Hogwarts. These fics explore what Snape's life might have been like if he had had friends other than Lily and his housemates. Commonly, Hermione is described as very similar to Lily, but with a greater capacity for forgiveness and compassion. She still gives him hell when he's an ass, but she would forgive him later when he apologizes. So that's the premise that 'explains' how Snape could fall for Hermione. Hermione falling for Snape is usually attributed to an initial attraction to his intelligence and also the common bond of being bullied (pre-troll in the bathroom and assumed pre-Hogwarts).

I do agree that it doesn't fit with Snape's character as written by Rowling; he would never get involved with a student or be lovey-dovey. But it's fanfiction, and while some authors really enjoy writing true to how Rowling described characters, I would say the large majority of fics are OOC, no matter what pairing is being shipped. This got way longer than I intended so I'm just going to stop there...

EDIT: Finally decided to fix my auto-correct mistake to lovey-dovey.

But I always come back to how Snape is basically a schizo that has two opposite personality. One with an eternal hard on for Harry's mom, and another with a burning hatred for the guy who got with Harry's mom, and takes it all out on the woman's son who he claims to love.

I guess I have to give credit to JKR. There are very few characters in fiction that I truly hate, but Snape is just one of them. He's a greatly designed character, it's just that he well and truly disgusts me on a visceral level. I can't get into any fanfiction that has him in a romantic role.

***** Understandable. It's less about the cross-generational pairings for you; you just don't like Snape. I know it's blasphemy to most people, but ^{Sirius is my least favorite character}. I have no desire to ever read a Sirius-centric fic, and thinking about him in a cross-generational pairing makes me throw up in my mouth a little bit.

It may be that I'm influenced too much by fanon, but I interpret Snape's personality in a totally different way than you. Even when reading the 7th book, I never thought that Snape was "obsessed" with Lily. Did Snape and Lily have the healthiest relationship? No. He was starved for companionship and clung to the first person to show him kindness. I really do believe that had Lily died in a different manner or lived, Snape would have eventually moved on. I think the longevity and intensity of his love for Lily are a direct result of the guilt he felt for his role in her death compounding with the guilt from ruining their friendship. I never perceived it as sexually-driven. I see the progression as friendship love to angsty teenage love to guilt-ridden courtly love. It's almost as if he's duty-bound to love her and try to right the wrongs he committed.

As for James, why the hell wouldn't he hate James? James and Sirius were his tormentors during school. Hogwarts must have been hellish for him. Sure, Snape could dish it right back to them, but I have no doubt that the Marauders instigated the feud. To add insult to injury, after a prank that nearly gets Snape killed, he owes a life debt to one of his bullies and nobody receives any punishment. It certainly didn't help that Lily ended up with James, but that was by no means the core reason Snape hated James; it was just salt in a very raw wound.

I do think it's unacceptable to treat a child the way he treated Harry. However, I can understand why, even though I think it's wrong. I think it speaks to how deeply psychologically scarred Snape was due to the bullying at the hands of the Marauders. He literally cannot separate Harry from his father because of their looks. Throw in some guilt every time he sees Harry's eyes, and it's practically a miracle that Snape stayed as controlled as he did. Even though he cannot get over his unfounded dislike for Harry, Snape still does what he can to protect Harry because he has a deep sense of duty.

And now I'm going to just go and read some SS/HG until I pass out from exhaustion haha

**** Not OP but for me it's not that their gay it's that if there's a Slash fic being written everyone and there mother is gay. Then usually everyone else is homophobic. Then there's no real plot just rabid sex everywhere, which as a straight person isn't enjoyable for me to read.

***** Have you ever read slash fic? It sounds like maybe you've only read a few crappy ones or are basing your opinions on some preconceived, kind of homophobic view. Because I've read slash for past 14 years over a number of fandoms and pairings.

What you said is not the case for nearly every single fic I've ever read. There are so many good slash fics with little or no sex, with amazing plots, where only the main slash pairing is gay, and have no homophobia at all. I'd be happy to send you links to show you if you'd like.

It's okay not to like slash, just like it's okay to not like horror movies or dogs or chocolate ice cream. I just wanted to let you know that the reasons you listed are not accurate.

Don't you /fucking dare/ call me homophobic because I don't like slash fics you ignorant little shit. I don't like reading about gay sex, i'm straight sue me, but to assume i'm homophobic because of that is pathetic.

******* It seems I struck a nerve, and I'm sorry if I've upset you. Maybe you've read some really shitty stories, or heard about some really shitty stories and are assuming they all must be like that. I know I've done that before, for example I used to hate all fish simply because I hated canned tuna and fish sticks not realizing fresh fish is fucking delicious. I know it's not quite the same, but hopefully you get what I'm trying to say?

The vast majority of slash fics are not like you explained. I wish I could show you some good stories so you could know what I'm talking about, but I'll respect your decision of not wanting to read them. Again, it's okay to not like reading slash, but please understand that they're not all just sex fics with no plot. I've read so many plotty fics that have no sex at all, just like I'm sure there's plenty of het fic out there that has no sex. There's as much diversity in slash fic as there is in het or gen fic. Just keep that in mind, is all I'm trying to say.

Now, this I can understand.

Ron is the worst "best mate" ever, and just as bigoted as Draco. He's a "fair-weather" friend, turning his back on Harry again, and again, and again. You can trust him more to be jealous than to stand up for his friends.

Ginny is a two-dimensional fangirl, enamoured with the Legend of The Boy-Who-Lived. She probably wouldn't recognize the real Harry Potter without the famous scar and the cheap and ugly glasses.

The Twins are at times straight out bullies, and their prank inventions borders on being lethal. Remember the Ton-Tongue Toffee?

Molly is smothering and overbearing, and sending howlers is just bad parenting. Arthur is hen-pecked at home, and utterly incompetent in his muggle-related job. He may be /interested/ in muggle technology, but he is still completely clueless about it. The flying car breaks all the hypocrisy meters.

**** Ron, as I read him, isn't particularly unvirtuous in the realm of teenage boys. But he isn't exceptional, either. All his various insecurities and problems are entirely understandable; he's basically just a normal kid, thrust among prodigies.

But that's the thing: to deal with the crap he deals with, Harry needs exceptional. He himself is ridiculously brave and a combat prodigy. Hermione is more loyal than anyone and the smartest witch in her year. Ron is...a normal kid. He rises to the occasion quite magnificently, many times, as for instance during the end of their third year. But he doesn't manage it perfectly. And that's what's required. While understanding that his reasons for doing so are entirely understandable, his turning his back on Harry, twice, was quite dangerous. Either time that happened, it could easily have killed Harry and (if you believe the prophecy) the entire Wizarding world with him. He repeatedly interrupts their efforts to let Harry /survive/ the Trial of the Month with petty jealousy and teenage drama. This isn't indicative of a special character flaw on his part, but it is the lack of an exceptional virtue. And, through no fault of his own, he's stuck in a situation where this ordinary, unremarkable human vice could quite possibly destroy the world.

So I can see the bashing. It's stupid, but in canon there are good reasons to be frustrated with Ron. Personally, I prefer to either write him out or revamp him to be better-suited for the situation in which he finds himself. But if you're inclined to vengeance through literature, he does present himself as a target.

The other Weasleys mostly don't have enough character depth to really analyze. Fred and George are the generic pranksters. Mrs. Weasley is the generic mildly-overbearing mother. They're background characters; this is what they're meant to be like. Ginny was originally generic, then got promoted to love interest and didn't lose that much of her genericness. This is one major part of why the canon pairing is unsatisfying.

** Neville/Luna. I actually find it kind of offensive; at least the way most people explain it - 'well, he's a boy, and she's a girl, and they're both a bit WEIRD, so they totally go together!' -__-

Harry Potter is bad anyway as a franchise for pairing all its main characters in nice heterosexual married couples who happen to be their highschool sweethearts/first loves; but all of the six main characters happening to form three couples? I find that a bit far-fetched, a bit like romance for the sake of it.

I don't even feel they ARE both a bit weird. Neville's a wee bit shy, sure, because his gran is a scary parent-figure and he doesn't have many friends, whereas Luna is a complete hippie free spirit. I also always got the impression that Luna was quirky yet quite intelligent, whereas Neville, even post-confidence, is still a bit of a bumbler - it is really only his Defence marks that pick up after the DA.
