It's really quite amazing when such a long-running fic updates. It's even more amazing when it updates after such a long hiatus. Either way, S'Tarkan has put forth a lot of effort to continue his long-loved fic even after his health concerns!


** Astonishing. I'm frankly shocked that this has happened. I suppose I'll have to go and remember what was going on...

*** More than that. If you look at their blog (Viridian Dreams), /Nightmares of Futures Past/ has come back from a three-year hiatus /three times/. Again, understandable, but possibly the strangest update schedule I've seen.

** So weird. I loved that fic when I read it, and despite its flaws, I still enjoyed the update and want to see it finished. There's so many fics I've dropped mid-chapter for far lesser annoyances. It's weird what effect nostalgia has.

Now if /Forging the Sword/ would update...

**** The very first fanfic I ever read was Sailor Ranko by Fire. After that, Burgerbecky had picked up the tale, and despite the wooden narration, I'd praise all the gods willing to listen if Thrice in a Millennium were to update tomorrow. I need to know what was up with Ukyo imitating the Senshi as she was.

(Obviously it's because she's gained some form of magic muscle memory from them when they healed her, but come on, there was no reason to blue ball us that far into the story...)

*** The war is over but at a terrible cost. In the end, everyone but Harry is dead and he decides to send his memories back into the past and to the body of his first-year self. from then on he befriends the same people avoiding the pitfalls of his first years and he gradually lets them know what exactly happened in the future.

**** For me, what really sells it is the characters and their relationships. We get to see Ginny, for example, as a main character from day 1, and Neville come into his own much sooner. Since Harry is trying to keep a low profile, he isn't gallivanting around the countryside incinerating Horcruxes in Fiendfyre; instead, he's taking time for his friends, building up their confidence and their skills. He's assuming that one way or another, there will be a war, and he wants the people he cares about to survive this time.

** So, why would Snape take such an interest in Draco Malfoy? Is he simply being paid by Lucius? If so, why didn't something like that ever happen in the first timeline? I don't think that Karkaroff was any moral paragon who would have flatly refused such an offer. If that's not it, then what's motivating Snape?

Of course, in the first timeline people entered their own names in the Goblet, which would make it harder to choose Draco over Viktor. But that raises questions of its own about how and why that change came about.

Meanwhile, I can't think of many goals that the agent could have "almost succeeded in achieving" except to kill Harry Potter.
