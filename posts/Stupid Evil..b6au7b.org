I know it is a common fan fiction trope to have Voldemort torturing his followers, but is that ever witnessed in canon? It seems a good way to lose the loyalty of your followers to torture them for every perceived failure. JKR touts Riddle as being very intelligent, this isn't really seen in canon but I also don't really recall seeing him torturing one of his followers in canon either.

If it is NOT a canon occurrence, why then is it so popular an activity for the fan version of Voldemort? It makes him...well, 'stupid evil' as the title of this post implies and ultimately reduces the impact of his character in some ways.

Thoughts?


** In the three years Voldemort had his new body we saw him torture his followers exactly three times and all were for major fuck ups, and we know that it wouldn't have been more often because Harry could see it when Voldemort was angry.

Of course fanon took those three instances and made it Voldemort general attitude and he cant live a day without torturing somebody Its the nature of fanon to take things that happen occasionally in canon and scale them up to ridiculous amounts that dont make sense, like Dumbledore being addicted to lemon drops, Lupin to chocolate, History class being literally only about Goblin Rebellions, or Hermione being extremely rule worshiping and Ron being a gluttonous sloth.

*** Its true, but we do have to extrapolate a bit from what we know of them.

BTW Ron as an enormous gluttonous sloth is a wonderful image.

**** I'm now imagining him being replaced with giant three-toed sloth, and nobody noticing the difference.

***** A giant slobbish, ginger, sloth. I picture it scratching its backside and Hermione chastising it for being rude. Sadly this might actually be an improvement over most portrayals of Ron.

** He could torture them when he is not angry, and Harry wouldn't sense it then.

*** Why would he torture his followers if he wasn't angry? In canon he gave no indication that he would do something like this without provocation.

** Presumably the authors think it shows an unassailable confidence in his own powers, and therefore makes him seem like more of a threat. And it's easier to write a powerful character that an intelligent one.

*** True that. Powerful is easy, just put on a bigger light show. Intelligent is hard, as even smart people can struggle to portray it well.
