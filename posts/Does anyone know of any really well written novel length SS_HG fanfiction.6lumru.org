It can take place at anytime in the HP universe, and I would also like for there to be smut.


** Oh! This is my question. Of course people define well-written in different ways but here are some in addition to the ones recommended already.

** linkffn(Sin & Vice)

Fantastic story, involving a time traveling, torture-altered Hermione and a slightly less asshole than canon Snape.

Superb amounts of smut.

  In her sixth year, Dumbledore makes Hermione a key figure in a plan to help Harry defeat Voldemort. (It's difficult to summarize this without spoilers--- HG/SS; there's a Time Turner involved but probably not how you expect; the story really gets started in Chapter Three.)
