** There are definitely strong feelings on both sides of the Dumbledore table. In my mind it comes down to writing and thinking of Dumbledore by his actions as written or his character as written.

JK Rowling wrote an inconsistent series that experiences serious growing pains as a result of adapting from children's fantasy to darker general audience fiction. Things that are whimsical in early books, like the trope of the chosen one being abandoned to live with bad relatives (a la Cinderella) become horrifying if seen through a more realistic lens, with Dumbledore admitting that he knew he was condemning Harry to a horrible childhood by leaving him with the Dursleys in the fifth book. Additionally, actions taken by Dumbledore for the sake of plot (cant have competent adults in a children's book or there wont be anything for the hero to do) when looked at through a non fantasy lens are unacceptable, such as allowing Quirrel to stay in the school, leaving the school by broom, protecting the stone with childish traps, etc.

On the other hand, Dumbledore the character, as written, is a generally good guy, well meaning, accomplishing much good, but making mistakes.

To a fanfiction writer this leaves three options: ignore it like Rowling, hold Dumbledore accountable for his actions, or provide justification and explanation for his actions.

For many fics, treating the whole situation like Rowling does can be best, just pretend that everything is fine with child heroes doing everything. This allows the author to focus on the main story they want to tell.

For others, if a fic is intended to have more strictly enforced logic, this can't be allowed. Which leaves the other options, vilify or justify. Dumbledore is out of touch and lacks empathy whether from a malicious or good hearted place. He still did bad things. OR Dumbledore is magnificent like in the books and has reasons for everything that must be explained, there were spells keeping Harry safe on the doorstep, the traps weren't intended as an actual defense for the stone, just the mirror, etc.

** Dumbledore's failings to me can be summarized by his very first actions in the first novel.

He leaves a 15 month old toddler in a basket on the doorstep. In November. In the middle of the night.

Unless Harry were magically restrained, the number of things that could have gone wrong there are innumerable. There is zero excuse.

Dumbledore has no concept of how other people live. It's not malice, it's “smartest guy in the room” syndrome. He thinks that because he is usually right, he is always right - a factor which he admits later in OotP. The second half of this, of course, is him stating that his failures are of a higher magnitude as well.

The other thing - if you take late series Dumbledore, his actions as early series Dumbledore literally cannot be explained.

** I think negative portrayal and bashing arent the same thing. I've seen both, and while I think bashing (in regards to any character) is a sign of immature writing and low quality in general, negative portrayal is not. Especially with a character like Dumbledore. IMO the thing with him is that he is either a colossal incompetent who has been cashing in on the glory of a single duel for decades, or a very morally gray character, who while one of the good guys, does /not/ have Harry's best interests at heart, and instead just plays everyone like a chess master. The /incompetent adult&kids must fix it all/ trope from a lot of literature geared towards younger audiences doesnt make such a good leap when taken into a more mature realm. Thats why Dumbledore is such a polarizing character.

My personal headcanon about him is that he did not change one bit from his youth, and he is the same aspiring Dark Lord (not the same type of DL as Voldie though) he was in his late teens. He is still following the ideals he coined along with Grindelwald, and all his actions are /for the greater good/. The only reason he fought against Gellert and he is more subdued now is a form of penitence for killing Ariana. I think that is also the reason of his inane philosophy about forgiveness and second chances.

** Dumbledore is very bashable. His actions and inactions in the books points to either 1) a thoroughly evil character, or 2) massive incompetence. I think it's incompetence.

Writing a fic without addressing Dumbledore's mistakes must be difficult. He's a central character, and many plot points originate with him. The Philosopher's Stone has an obvious set-up with all the weak "obstacles" they have to pass.

** Because JK Rowling subordinated character consistency and world consistency to plot convenience. This, out of universe, leads to a series of books with some clear flaws. In-universe, however, without the ability to cite JK Rowling or plot reasons, the only logical explanation is that Dumbledore is either not as intelligent as he's said to be or not as moral as he's said to be.

Simple example: in Philosopher's Stone, the Trio must go after Quirrell themselves because Dumbledore flew to the Ministry instead of apparating, flooing, portkeying, phoenix travelling or using a house elf. Why? Out of universe, the answer is "JK hadn't invented apparition, floo, house elf travel or Phoenix travel yet". But you can't give that explanation in-universe. So instead we get "because Dumbledore is a moron who didn't think that leaving Hogwarts unprotected for hours was a silly idea when instant teleportation exists" or "because Dumbledore deliberately manipulated events so that Harry would face Quirrell".

Another example that I see a lot: in Chamber of Secrets, Hermione figures out that the monster is a Basilisk in a few months of research, at age 12. Dumbledore, who's older, wiser, smarter, more magically knowledgeable, and has the extra clues of knowing Tom Riddle opened the Chamber, knowing Myrtle was the victim, being able to easily learn that the spiders were fleeing etc has no clue until Harry tells him. How did he not, in the 50+ years since Myrtle, speak to her and find out about the glowing yellow eyes? How did he not realise that the snake house's snake-speaking founder's monster, commanded by the snake-speaking Voldemort, which killed instantly but also could petrify, has glowing yellow eyes, and mysteriously is attacking around the same time all Hagrid's roosters are dead and the spiders are fleeing, was a Basilisk? Yet Hermione did, with less information? Again, out of universe the answer is "JK needed a plot to happen, and it would have been boring if Dumbledore closed and evacuated Hogwarts before killing the Basilisk easily with a rooster after the first petrifaction". But in-universe, without that excuse, you have to contrive a reason. So we get "Dumbledore is less intelligent than a 12 year old" or "Dumbledore could have figured out it was a Basilisk, but didn't bother" or "Dumbledore knew it was a Basilisk but didn't tell anyone or do anything for malicious/manipulative reasons".

Simply put, for JK the most important thing is that the plot beats she's envisioned take place. If, to get there, she has to ignore things she's already said, or invent some new magic that retroactively makes plot holes, or just have characters act in ways that are strange or inconsistent, then she shrugs and does it anyway. But when writing fanfic, unlike literary analysis, you can't reference that and so you have to make it consistent and with Dumbles, that often means bashing.

There is another answer that works well enough: Dumbledore was flying to the edge of Hogwarts grounds, at which point he would apparate. Out-of-universe this is a retcon (like you say, apparition didn't exist yet), but in-universe it works fine.

#+begin_quote
  Yet Hermione did, with less information?
#+end_quote

Hermione did not have less information. She had the key piece of information that Dumbledore lacked: Harry, a parselmouth, had heard the monster in the walls when no one else could. That piece of information alone is enough to identify the monster; without it, the monster could be anything. Let us remember also that it was not known until this point that basilisks can petrify their victims.

Everything Dumbledore knew would have led him /away/ from thinking it was a basilisk. Indeed, if he had happened to think "maybe the monster is a basilisk" his next thought would have been "no, that's impossible, basilisks kill their victims not petrify them".

**** Yeah you can obviously retcon all sorts, but I was talking in the sense of remaining consistent with canon. Especially given that HBP proves Dumbledore didn't need to leave the wards. And as to the Basilisk:

Dumbledore had more information than Hermione, and the only piece he possibly lacked was the voices in the walls (honestly, it's Slytherin's monster, it's obviously a snake but whatever). Except that JK Rowling has said Dumbledore understands parseltongue.

And if a 12 year old could figure out that an indirect gaze would petrify, surely a 100+ year old genius wizard could, especially given these crucial pieces of information:

1. It's Slytherin's monster, once controlled by Voldemort

2. It killed Myrtle by looking at her with big yellow eyes

3. None of the victims besides Myrtle saw the eyes directly

4. The spiders are fleeing, a sign of a basilisk

5. The roosters, a weakness of the basilisk, have all been killed

Add in that he supposedly understood parseltongue, and this becomes even stranger.

But fundamentally, even if you can excuse some of Dumbledore's mistakes like this, the sheer volume of them and the fact that certain trends - overzealous secrecy, manipulation, missing obvious logic (like why have a locked door but put the key in the room, in PS) - are repeated in all of them, makes finding a good faith, pro-Dumbledore, Watsonian explanation without retconning very difficult. Although I'd love to see it done well.

** Dumbledore's actions generally do not hold up when scrutinised. Just to take the lowest of the low hanging fruits: WTF do you fly a broomstick from Hogwarts to the Ministry for an urgent call? Even if one forgets that one is housing an artefact that they are meant to protect, it is the biggest time waster. The IRL explanation is: "Rolwing hadn't invented floo yet." but in book, there's no distinction made here. Thus Dumbledore is irresponsible to the Nth degree.

We are told Dumbledore is really smart and talented and he's written a bit incompetent, passive, and, to be honest, as a typical older person. "Youth can not know what age thinks and feels, but old men are guilty if they forget what it is to be young."

*** I honestly think it's a /wee/ bit more than that, in large part because of the nature of /why/ Harry might've rebelled (his abuse at home being a topic a lot of kids who are using the HP books as escapism might find difficult to justify) but I feel this is for the most part right.

Dumbledore comes off, honestly, as unintentionally damaging to others. He's terribly incensed with ensuring things Get Better and sometimes he can get lost in that - he's old, y'know? He hides things because he believes others wont accomplish what needs to be done if they know, but still feels like shit might need to get better (before it gets worse) so he's stuck in this infuriating limbo of being unwilling to give up the goat while also needing to sell that damn goat before everyone starves and dies.

I'd never say he was malicious, nor that many of his actions even came close to it. He's - like you said - unfortunately passive to the point of extremes, and as far as I figure he finds out - admittedly /when he dies/ - the error of being passive (reflecting both his own history and the future he's tried to carve out for others) but is too late to be more proactive.

I don't think too much of fan fiction has him rebel for actual canon reasons, unfortunately. There are /so/ many. It's usually Dumbledore stole his money or placed a block on him. And for all of the fandoms issues with whiny OOTP Harry, they write him very, very whiny.

It really shouldn't take that much to keep him from being "Dumbledore's man through and through." Pre OOTP Harry is easily manipulated. You just need someone to be kind to him.

​

I think what annoys me most is when they make Severus Dumbledore's "victim." Severus willingly joined the death eaters and in the books only begged to protect Lily, not even Harry and James, to Dumbledore. Tons of death eaters went to prison except for the ones who bought their way out, and Severus couldn't afford that. But somehow Dumbledore is the evil one for giving Severus a job, keeping him out of prison, and more and not doing it for free and making him try to redeem himself by spying. Like Snape feeling bad about Lily doesn't mean he should just skip off into the sunset and have no obligations.

Problem is when I see fics where Harry wakes up one day and realizes that Dumbledore is the reason for all his woes and decides to train and shit so that he can kill that pest 'Tom'. Oh, and without help from that old people's society called The Order of the Phoenix or the totally corrupt Ministry of Magic. And about Snape, I totally agree.

** Just like what other said, either because teens ff author have a raging boner for becoming a rebel that or for the sake fixing the plot hole in canon series, mostly teen being edgy really.

*** No. No. And utter, NO.

The simple fact is that Dumbledore's actions do not hold up when viewed realistically from an adults POV. You put a child on a doorstep a November night. You do not check up on said child and makes sure he is doing well. You do not check up on said child's godfather and even try to make sure that everything is above board. You do not try to teach him anything beyond the regular curriculum before his sixth year. And what he learned there was barely if at all relevant. Or it could've at least been covered in a single Saturday instead of 1 hour every now and then.

How much of that sounds benign to you? Especially when you add in Snape's memory of "Raised him like a lamb to slaughter." To me it doesn't paint a pretty picture.
