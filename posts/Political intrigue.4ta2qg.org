  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.

*** I remember my LJ peeps talking about Blythely's "Corridors of Power," an H/D set of fics in which Draco (and I think Harry) both sit in Parliament. From what I can see, the fics are brisk and amusing and full of British slang.

I don't read Harry/Draco so I can't attest to their quality, and it's pretty clear from glancing through them that Blythely subscribes to the fanon of elegant, devastatingly smart and witty Draco, but my impression is that they're extremely well written and highly entertaining. And I'm pretty sure they revolve around Muggle/magical politics.
