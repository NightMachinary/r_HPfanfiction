** There's an abandoned one called linkffn(The Observer Effect) that I enjoyed. Fem!Harry kinda ends up stalking Tony Stark (but he's cool with it).

*** It hasn't been abandoned, the author just... went out for cigarettes.

Three years ago.

#+begin_quote
  After Tony Stark outs himself as Iron Man on live television, he acquires a magical stalker in the form of a bored (female) Harry Potter, who has emerged from the Veil of Death in a world without wizards. A cat-and-mouse game ensues when Stark's curiosity drives him to ever-increasing lengths to capture his invisible benefactor, who struggles with maintaining her distance.

** There are a number, and I'm sure I have more than a few in my favorites but I don't really want to go digging for them, if you'll pardon my laziness. Instead, I give you the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Miss-Potter/19146/][Miss Potter Community]]*. Just set the Ratings to All and then Ctrl-F "Avengers". Should get you results.
