I was reading a fanfic linkffn(8034380) (First time trying to link wish me luck!) and he thanks the house elves at one point and I realized something when Dumbledore says that in book one he is calling the NAMES of 4 (1 for each table) house elves to deliver the food!


** ...That's actually a highly likely theory. One elf each is in charge of activating the switching spells or whatever is used for each table.

OP you magnificent person.

**** Hmm.. Perhaps the cue to serve the head table is Dumbledore finishing his speech. He gives a speech each year so he probably just says. "When I'm done talking to the midgets serve the head table the food" (Heavy Paraphrasing and editing of his speech patterns done.)

** Nitwits are how Ravenclaw see other houses.

Oddments are how Slytherins see everyone else, odd and useless.

Blubber is how Gryffindors see the others, too lazy to do anything.

Tweak is how Hufflepuffs see everyone else, needing to be modified to work together better.

** I thought he was mentioning the different houses by calling out the reverse characteristic of them.

Nitwit = Ravenclaw (definitely not nitwits)\\
Oddment = Slytherin (They try to be something more than just "oddments")\\
Blubber = Gryffindor (they're so courageous that they don't blubber(cry))\\
Tweak = Hufflepuff (they don't need to be tweaked to fit in and be down-to-earth)

*** I'm basing my definition off Websters btw Oddments : a remnant or part of something, typically left over from a larger piece or set.

Anyway I feel like being a SLYTHERIN makes you the leftover house since all three other houses avoid them.

** These words don't really correspond to the common House-Elf naming standard in the books. And they are not used in the rest of the feasts.

I've always took these words to signify the quirkiness and absurdness of the magical world, maybe a sort of recommendation to keep an open mind and accept strange things.

*** Winky.... To wink a lot would get someone the nickname winky. If someone cried a lot it would get someone the nickname blubber. I KNOW people who have been called nitwit, Wasn't tweak a south park character? And oddment is the odd man out I guess :/ It seems house elves names are just weird.

See a pattern there?

Look, I see what you're trying to do, but it's nothing but a cute, implausible theory, and one that pretty much takes the meaning out of that scene. The whole point of it was to establish Dumbledore as a "kooky" character. You can apply those four words to pretty much anything you like, even defying House-Elf naming standards, but don't take it too far. Making these words utilitarian robes them of their importance.

** It's a fun theory but it doesn't hold with the naming conventions of the rest of the house elves. The surface level reading would say that this is just JK showing how whimsical the magical world is and what an oddball Dumbledore is, which is played for great effect against his later demonstrations of power. Also- kids book, that line was hilarious to 10 year old me.

But if you look a bit deeper, put yourself in Draco's shoes. You've just left your home and the watchful guard of your parents for the first time only to be placed under the thumb of a man your entire family despises, the one the dark lord feared! Dumbledore could look quite intimidating, sitting at the high table, on what is basically a throne, resplendent and powerful. Draco's boogeyman is sitting not fifty feet from him and we know that Malfoy isn't a very brave person ultimately. Then the defeater of Grindelwald stands up and says /“Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!”/. Rather disarming don't you think? Would that be enough to shift Draco from awed fear to scorn? After all Dumbledore can more readily work with a scornful opponent than a fearful one.

*** I don't think there /is/ any kind of naming convention with House Elves. Dobby and Winky both ending with a Y could be a coincidence, and Kreacher is just a bastardization of Creature. I could totally see Dobby being formally named Dobbins, or Winky as Winkle.

Or they could just as easily fit in. "Winky! Pinky! Dobby! Rye!"

**** Dobby, Winky and Hokey all share a pattern implying that house elves name themselves, i mean can you imagine Lucius thinking Dobby was a suitable name. The only one who bucks this trend is Kreacher who is an old elf raised in the house of Black who still rutinely decapitate and mount their servents. To the Blacks of old a /creature/ like that would be unworthy of a name.

***** Forgive me if I'm wrong, but isn't Hokey just from the games and such, not the books? I wouldn't even count him, and three elves is not a large enough sample size to determine a pattern.

Nitwit, Blubber, and Oddment could all be relocated from old families who died out or were put in Azkaban during or after the first Voldemort war. Perhaps insult names are the norm among pureblood families who practice darker magic and Malfoy only named Dobby differently because he wanted to pose as a moderate.

******** I remember a comment from a game dev, a couple of years ago lamenting the fact that there wasn't a good Quidditch video game. If they are to be believed, JK was *very* protective of her IP. No one else was allowed to name anything or use their own ideas because JK was still writing the books and wanted to keep her vision clear. Everything had to be vetted through her and she didn't have the time/interest to flesh out a game world.

So if we take that as true, then Hooky, as a name was probably vetted by JK at some point to fall in with her internal naming convention.

*** Excellent counterpoint but if not something nonsensical as a house-elf name what WOULD be a house elf name? (Don't name canon house elves please).

Plus Dumbledore never considered Draco an quote unquote 'enemy' even on his deathbed as you most likely recall. I doubt this would be the first time Draco has seen Dumbledore as him being pure blood. He most likely saw Dumbledore before and Lucius wouldn't mention to his own son that Dumbledore was stronger than the dark lord. He would have spoken of him with scorn and disregard most likely. Nothing more than a nuance.

On a opposite not however. Dumbledore COULD have done that as a way to ease Harry's fears or worries. (Legilimens!Dumbledore theory here.)
