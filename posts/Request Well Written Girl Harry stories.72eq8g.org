Are there any believable/well written girl Harry stories? Note do not give me a girl Harry where Harry's name is Harriet. I just shudder at his name being Harriet, no offense to anyone who's name is Harriet, it just feels like the author didn't put any real effort to naming the female version of Harry.

I also don't want the name to be Lily/Lillie/Lilly because that's his mom's name, it shouldn't be his/her name. And Petunia is out of the question as well obviously since that's his/her aunt's name. But any other name is fine.

Would rather it be completed, but a lot of chapters is fine. Any rating is fine am fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash. Anyone else can be gender bent as well, not just Harry.

*** Oh wow yes. This story is unmissable.

I don't normally read fem!Harry stories because they're often just a way of getting Harry together with Draco with no slash, but this one has a real reason for the change.

The canon characters are done well, but the stars are the OCs. I see someone already mentioned the Merlin arch, but for me the (ongoing) Indian adventure is even better. The Merlin story could fall back on an existing story that most readers would know, even if only to a small extent, but the Indian one is built from pretty much nothing, yet is still utterly compelling.

The only problem is that it's not finished and "sporadic updates" are few and far between. But still one of the very best HPFF stories around.

FYI, while not technically a gender bent harry story, it does feature her pretending to be male for significant portion of the series. The author has indeed called her Harriet, but goes by the name, "Rigel" for most of the story/ series.

  Hermione gives a lecture on "gender flip fanfiction"; i.e. fanfiction depicting an AU where one or more characters has been born the opposite sex. Of course, when the ones attending the lecture are Harry and Ron... or should that perhaps be "Holly" and "Ronnie"?... it might get a little difficult to stay on track. A very meta story.

  Her godfather is dead. So is Tom Riddle, which appears to be the only thing anyone else cares about. Oh, and getting ahold of her, her money, and her titles. Fuck that noise. Ianthe learned how to Maraud from the best, and she doesn't intend to take this lying down.She intends to change a single moment in time - and change the life of her godfather, herself, and the whole of Magical Britain. That the price for that change is all that she is, including her life? There's always a price.Merlin showing up and telling her that the price of her actions isn't her death? Not part of her calculations. Changing the past is surprisingly easy. Living it might just be harder. Especially when the lives she changed to save the future collide with the one she now lives, thirty years in the past.

** Ya, Harriet gets on my nerves too. Sometimes I consider getting an extention that replaces all instances of harriet with something else, lol.

To Reach Without is pretty good. It features harry who's accidental magic changes his gender. Its pretty au and in directions I usually dislike (large magical population, other wizarding schools, elemental magic) and a decent portion of it is focused on politics, but it pulls these off pretty well. The beginning is pretty angsty but it mellows out after a bit. It recently updated too :) linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11862560/32/To-Reach-Without]])

Jamie Evans is one of those op, time travelling harry stories that redeem the genre. I especially liked the miskatonic university bit. The first story is completed :) but it has a sequel isn't completed and probably abandoned :( linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/Jamie-Evans-and-Fate-s-Fool]])

**** That said, in this particular case there is a reason why Harry has that particular name, and the reason has to do with the fact that he couldn't choose Harry and wanted to have something he more or less had a claim to, and so ended up with a female version of James. Maybe not the best name, but at least it bloody has a reason and is sensible enough (as in, it's a name a parent could give to their daughter without having been hit in the head), which is already a thousand times better than the usual.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

  Fem!Slytherin!Harry (Mary); realistic!Dursleys; consistent!Professors; follows the books VERY closely, especially the first three chapters or so (deviation from canon is exponential, but slow to start). See first chapter for preface discussion of background/differences from canon. Most chapters K-rated, T for language, several sections from Snape's perspective are T. Later books may be M-rated.
