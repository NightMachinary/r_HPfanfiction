So wizards can't just create galleons out of Transfiguration. This might be because the goblins make galleons in such a way that it's impossible, or maybe something more.

We know that magic can be conceptual, abstract, based in symbolism and whatnot. Is it plausible that the reason a wizard couldn't simply Transfigure themselves gold or diamonds is because these things are valuable, and things that are universally considered highly valuable have a magical quality to it (the very concept of it) and therefore push back against the Transfiguration, so to speak.

I mean, gold only means a lot because we say it does. It's the reason paper money works. It's the same with Lily Potter's sacrifice. Logically, her letting herself die would do absolutely nothing to stop Voldemort. But because we assign a meaning to such a sacrifice, because people all over the world would deem such a thing worthy of respect, it gains a magical quality to it.

One could argue that Aguamenti contradicts this, as water is valuable. But water is rather accessible nowadays. What if, during a time where water was hard to come by and therefore incredibly valuable, such a charm didn't exist, or simply didn't work? And once water became more readily available, it began to work? Maybe first as a trinkle out the wand, eventually becoming capable of putting out house fires, now that water could be found in water bottles, water fountains, sinks, etc.

So in terms of Gamp's Laws, it would be food, knowledge (can't Transfigure something into a textbook), and things that are considered universally valuable. And then two more, but who knows what those are.

Are there any big holes in this theory that I'm missing? I feel like they are and I'll just end up looking dumb.


** I agree that gold cannot be transfigured and therefore represents one of the exceptions to Gamp's law; I also agree that the reason for this is that it is valuable.

However, I disagree that the exception to Gamp's law is the more general "valuable things" rather than just "gold". I think gold occupies a special place that other valuable things do not share. For a start, we have seen Voldemort conjure silver. Secondly, we know from PS Gringotts scene that gems in the wizarding world are much larger than those in the Muggle world - presumably, magic has been involved in their creation. At a more fundamental level, however, is the observation that pretty much everything has "universal value". There are very few goods that cannot be sold anywhere in the world. If it was not possible to transfigure "valuable things" then you wouldn't be able to transfigure anything.

Further, I would be hesitant in identifying human society as the origin of gold's value in the HP world. The HP magic system is not Discworld; things don't become true simply because a large number of people believe them. That way lies "wish magic" super Harry fics, where Harry's ignorance of the nature of magic suddenly becomes his greatest strength, because he's literally too stupid to realise he can't do something and therefore magic just lets him do it.

That's not the way the HP system works - magic is repeatedly presented as a thing that can be studied and investigated, with its own complex rules, and where diligent study and deep knowledge is reflected in practical ability to cast magic. Even if writing a fic advertised as AU, I'm not sure why an author would /want/ to change the magic system to make stupidity and ignorance laudable characteristics which grant you power.

Magic is not scientific in the sense that it more or less completely ignores all physical laws, and moreover flies in the face of the scientific worldview (magic is dualist and anti-reductionist), but magic /is/ like science is so far as there is an objective truth to it - it's not all just in the wizards' heads. With that in mind, I would say that gold is valuable because the system of magical rules attributes it with that property, not because humans do. It's not the case that if humans stopped valuing gold, it would suddenly become transfigurable. (And indeed, if you wanted to go a step further you could suggest that the reason why humans consider it valuable is because magical law makes it scarce).

(With respect to knowledge, I think this is too general an exception as well. For example, you could transfigure something into a rabbit and then dissect the rabbit and thereby learn about the rabbit's biology, because you don't need to know the biology/chemistry of a thing in order to transfigure it. I think the exception is rather "products of human artifice". I.e. you can create natural objects and generic ones like chairs, but you cannot transfigure objects which require human creativity to produce such as a beautiful chair, a book, etc.)

It could be argued that the quality of the transfiguration could alter the 'beauty' of the final object. I think we see examples of more talented witches and wizards having better finishes on the objects. Patterns and such on well done transfigurations whereas poor transfigurations retain a finish that reflects the original object. Dumbledore's conjured chairs in OotP are described as 'a squashiy chintz arm-chair.' As conjuration is part of transfiguration I think that it shows that human artifice carries over to transfiguration. Instead I think if you look at the failings of witches and wizards to cast a shield charm we can say that perhaps magic is really hard and can often be forgotten if the spells aren't practised, especially if the spell is considered difficult. We are also told that transfiguration is one of the hardest subjects. Perhaps its just too much effort for normal witches and wizards to create their own much in the way I could make my own furniture but I would much rather buy some. Perhaps a chair for example is practically worthless, you are instead paying for the service of the person making it. Their time is valuable whereas the creation isn't.

**** Right but when the person performing transfiguration is the person being creative then you're not magicing creativity out of nowhere - it's coming from the caster, an artist using magic to produce an artistic work. The exception proposed is not that transfiguration cannot be used to make beautiful objects, but rather that it cannot /replace/ human artifice.

For example: a wizard author could use transfiguration to put words onto a page instead of using a quill, but they could not just conjure up a new book without going to the effort of actually writing it.

*** What about partial animal transfiguration then? There are many examples in the books of whiskered snuffboxes etc. Is that a snuffboxes that can move and has some characteristics of a mouse, or the other way around? What would the insides be? If a first year student makes a failed transfiguration and his snuffmouse is something in between... will it have the insides of a mouse? Or will it contain tobacco? We know that the even a partial transfiguration can take on the characteristic of the original item. Also what happened to Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle at the end of the OotP contradicts that human transfiguration is too difficult to use in a battle, since the DA made him sprout tentacles and other things in a matter of seconds. I don't think you can make such definite statements when the source material says otherwise.

**** I'm afraid I don't quite understand the point you're making. What aspect of my post is the existence of partial transfiguration supposed to challenge?

One imagines that the exact status of a partial transfiguration will be a matter of fact which varies from example to example i.e. it all depends on how partial the transfiguration is. A snuffbox into a mouse may have tobacco insides or mouse insides depending on how close the student has come to a complete transfiguration.

But either way, I'm really not getting what conclusions we are supposed to draw from this with respect to the nature of transfiguration. For me the only real take-away from this is that it emphasises how transfiguration is divorced from Muggle understanding of biology, because of course according to Muggle understanding, a mouse which is half-snuffbox should die very quickly.

Re: Malfoy sprouting tentacles, I'm pretty sure that was an unintended consequence of Malfoy being hit by so many different spells which interacted in unpredictable ways, not a transfiguration.

*** One must distinguish things which are exceptions to Gamp's law from things which are simply outside the scope of transfiguration. There are far more than 5 things that transfiguration cannot do; the 5 exceptions are things that it /should/ be able to do but can't.

Transfiguration concerns the transformation of physical things into other physical things (including to creation of physical things from nothing, and vice versa). Magical acts outside of that definition are not exceptions to Gamp's law, they're just not Transfiguration.

A soul is not physical and therefore Transfiguration cannot create or change souls by definition, rather than as an exception.

As for why people don't use transfiguration as a direct offence, I think the answer is simply that transfiguration is very difficult and most wizards struggle with it. There are therefore always easier ways to directly attack someone. Why turn someone into a frog using difficult magic when you can blow a hole in them using easy magic?

**** Why do you think Dumbledore didn't try and transfigure Voldemort in their duel? Dumbledore is a master of transfiguration. Do you think Voldemort could counter it as it happened or something like that, because even an incomplete transfiguration can be devastating in a fight. I haven't been able to come up with a satisfying head canon to explain this.

***** I think transfiguration can be blocked and/or shielded the same as any other spell - the only spell we're told is unblockable is the Killing Curse, and that property is especially highlighted as noteworthy. While there /may/ be other unblockable spells, they're certainly not common.

Just because a spell does not travel through the air, it does not mean that it cannot be blocked. Most Charms in fact act directly upon the target without travelling to it, but I imagine they can be blocked too.

****** I see. Are you thinking of a protego type defense or some kind of counter spell cast prior to the fight? I'd imagine with a stunning spell or something of the sort, creating a shield or casting a counter would be easier because of the reflexive reaction to the light of the spell.

However, if all you need to cast spells is the flick of a wand like Dumbledore, I don't see how Voldemort could tell the difference between Dumbledore trying transfigure him and performing another type of spell.

Though, if skilled wizards can detect spells forming in battle like Dumbledore could detect Voldemort's spells in the cave, then I suppose the light would be meaningless, as their reflexes would be trained to react to the spells they detect.

I dont think Dumbledore nor Voldemort could successfully leglimens one another to detect the spells that way.

*** We do see people transfigure humans in such a way as to be potentially damaging (Crouch's body was transfigured and we know you can transfigure living humans as well). So I think that's definitely a thing. The reason people might not do it in combat is that it may be complicated/difficult to do so quickly.

Vanishment on the other hand might not work on a human.

*** I suspect there is an innate psychological quality in wizards and witches that, much like the psychological resistance to eating members of your own species, impedes the ability to perform certain tasks.

It isn't that they don't consciously want something, but that their unconscious mind resists certain behaviors and intents.

But then again, I've always suspected the reason wizards and witches can use magic in the first place is that they are suffering from something akin to a mental disorder. This makes their minds capable of controlling and channeling magic, it gives them an irrational mindset that is responsible for much of the problems that show up in the series.

** Ah transfiguration. One of the hardest subject to explain with the lack of information given. JKR didn't seem to think overly much about her magical system.

What I think about transfiguration, how it should work to make it a working system :

1. When you transfigure you only give a physical object the form of what you want and think and possibly a behaviour as how you think it would act or how you want it to act. For example you will transfigure a mouse that will either act how you think a mouse would act given your knowledge or acts how you want it to act (maybe harder). With this in mind I also think there is 2 way for magic to work. Either magic copy a mouse somewhere (which would be a bit to easy in my opinion) or better, the outer look would be a mouse but if you were to cut it, it would either revert or show some undefined mass of matter without all the precise working innards except if you knew exactly how it is (and even it wouldn't make it alive). For the same reason it would be possible to make a clock that shows the time correctly as you know what it is supposed to show but I doubt it would have all the gears and inner working except if you knew how exactly it is and the more complex the object would be, the harder it would be to make a working object. For example for a piano you would have to know how the strings make the sound and how they behave over time given heat, humidity, stress and other things. The harder and more complex the object, the more the result would be a weak, somewhat working, copy of the original goal. That would also explain why transfiguration seems to be considered as hard and dangerous. It would require skill, concentration and finesse.
2. The duration of a transfiguration is limited to the power of the caster, the complexity of the desired transfiguration and the innate resistance of the subject. For example inanimate to inanimate wouldn't be too hard but I think that living being would have some innate magic field or some magical subconscious self-awareness that would want to automatically revert to its original form except if using a lot of power or tricking the being into thinking it's something else. This is why transforming a table into a chair wouldn't be too hard as the table hasn't inner conscious or unconscious self but a mouse maybe. And again it'd be easier with a mouse than a human because of the brain power that define the consciousness self-awareness power. If you're strong enough to overcome said being magic or to trick the awareness it would hold longer or better (a human transformed in a really convincing chair would impede the magical awareness as a chair hasn't a mind and an animal has instinct that would flood said awareness). Coming back to duration, Crouch Jr. transfiguring his dead father into a bone would probably be easy enough as it's an object in one block, without too much complexity transfigured from a inanimate object. Bonus as there is already bones in a human body. It would hold for quite some time. Enough for nature to process it (animals, natural decomposition, ...) enough that when it would revert there wouldn't be enough left to recognize it as a body. For the same Crouch, transfiguring Draco into a ferret certainly should need quite some power or/and skills. It seems the transfigured Draco had not the mind of a human but of a ferret and its instinctual want to flee and hide with all the inner red alert would impede into the want to go back to human. That's also why I think transfiguring someone into an animal while making it keep its thought process would be hard and that there is a special branch with Animagi that transformed themselves voluntarily but also into only one other form (like giving your mind/soul/whatever an other form subconsciously accepted without wanting to revert).
3. Conjuration, size and weight: what happens when you vanish, conjure or transfigure things with massive (in percentage) size or weight difference. Where does matter come from or go to? Is it magic transformed into matter, air into matter or matter summoned/banished to another dimension with a reserve of energy/matter (a bit like the Pym particle works in the comics). We can see that Rita Skeeter transforms into a beetle and we can agree that the size and weight difference is huge. So it's possible but how? In any proposed cases, I think again that it would be hard to make an eternal conjuration/transfiguration but you can make it hold longer with significant more power and skill (if you're more precise in you transformation, the details will convince the form that it is what it is). Maybe with rituals, runes, potions, whatever you could make it hold while using ambient magic of maybe force the object to accept its new form as its original one. For living conjuration maybe it's the same as transfiguration and only creating something with the face and behaviour of what you wanted or maybe an invocation from somewhere (which wouldn't be nice if said creature had a family). I prefer to see it as a creation (more or less flawed) than an invocation.
4. Gold, precious rare material in general and food. I think food, as seen in a lot of fics, would only be a temporary transfiguration/conjuration without the correct necessary nutrients making it a best pointless or at worth dangerous (if it reverts while in your body). With this idea even food to food could be dangerous if a certain nutrient is sent in the incorrect processing part of your body to revert to something else after. As for diamond, gold and other things, I think the complexity of said material (all the specifications like behaviour under heat, electricity why it's solid and resilient, resistant and all) would make it really hard to make it happen (diamond would maybe be seen as false) and even harder to make it last. Wood may be more complex in a way but I think it would be easier to create maybe for the same reasons as why naturally some elements are rarer than others. It would also maybe require too much power. That would maybe also explain why the wizarding money IS of bronze, silver and gold. Because it can't be conjured or transfigured into consistently (economy would collapse). That's also why the Philosopher Stone is such an game-breaking item.
5. Living being wouldn't be alive? As said in 1. it would only be a copy with similar behaviour but it wouldn't create a soul. The complexity of thinking behind creating a living being with all it entails, thought process, wants, choices (too many things to describe but you get the idea) autonomous and all would be impossible in my opinion. Or necessitating a lot of trial and error, skill, power, time and maybe more than one person. Still without a soul... That's why portraits are copies and not living things and maybe (IF it was true) Hogwarts of the Sorting Hat could develop a sentience or even sapience over time but if so it would only be because of the presence of so many magic and magical minds and life to emulate, imitate, take snippet of and overall integrate over time... lot of time... like hundreds of years. But even I don't think they would have a soul. BUT, what is a living being. With the possible coming of "living" AI in the future, what can magic do?

Bonuses:

1. The Philosopher Stone and by extension alchemy would be a mix of transfiguration, potion but also the mundane way of seeing the world physic and chemistry. The more complex analysis of the world with atoms and maybe some magical tiny components as well as higher energy manipulation would make the complete, real, timeless transformation from a matter to another possible. The energy required to make such transformation wouldn't be attainable to a wizard without a catalyst that would deliver and maybe also help in its manipulation (not to go nuclear). Let's just hope this stone isn't the same as in FMA.
2. Aguamenti. To me this spell either takes water from somewhere else (and purify it) or it (as in a lot of fics) condense and manipulate the ambient humidity (making it hard to use in a desert). This would allow it to be drunk without side effect.
3. Refilling spell (after seeing another post about it) is the worst. You can't conjure nor transfigure food but you can refill a wine bottle? Meh nope. This spell isn't thought through enough and shouldn't exist in the way it's been given to us. To me it shouldn't work on food. Or at least without the consequences mentioned earlier.

Guh this was damn too long to write and I'm sure I didn't think of everything of forgot some details. Anyway that's the way I see the transfiguration/conjuration in HP work. I hope this was more or less clear.
