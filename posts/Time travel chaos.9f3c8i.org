I've read too many time travel fics where everything stays the same and everything goes the main character's way.

Does anyone know of any where the time travellers' presence and actions makes everything different e.g. , the DADA professors aren't the same each year, or Harry gets Lupin for his second year and Lockheart for his fourth year, or the Goblet of Fire picks different champions and all the tasks are different. Basically any where MC expects everything to go exactly the way they want and it doesn't.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

  Post DH. Harry could never have known Albus-Severus was the herald of the new dark age. He watched as his youngest child came to be known as the Dark Son. Now Harry goes back in time to save his family and his son from the dark path.

** This is pretty much the theme of linkffn(4101650) and sequels. (You really need to read the second book to appreciate the extent to which the world has been changed by the time travel.)

*** Oh the second book was awesome, in some ways I enjoyed it even more than the first.

It definitely showed how much attention the author paid to mapping out the plotline(s).

  AU. Harry, Ron, and Ginny send themselves back in time to avoid the destruction of everything they hold dear, and the deaths of everyone they love. This story is now complete! Stay tuned for the sequel!
