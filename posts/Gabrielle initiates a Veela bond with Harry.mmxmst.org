:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I' remember that the story was a oneshot. After Harry rescued Gabrielle, she initiated a Veela bond with him but didn't know the ramifications of her action. Harry and Gabrielle were unable to be more than 50 feet apart from each other. They went to live in France at the Delacour's house, and Harry hated Gabrielle for ruining his life. At the end of the story, there was a timeskip to where Harry and Gabrielle both died, but I don't remember whether they both committed suicide or died naturally. I do remember that Harry eventually forgave her though. Thanks in advance!


** I liked this fic because of the trope/cliche subversions.

The end was pretty heartbreaking -- especially as the Delecours momentarily hoped that they'd finally "reconciled".
