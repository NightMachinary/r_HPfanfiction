Which story do you think had the best Triwizard tournament? Not just a rewrite of the same three tasks, but new original challenges?

The story I always go back to for the best, most original Triwizard is 'The Lie I've Lived' by Jbern.


** Linkffn(The Power of the Mind by Landstradd)

The second Task is awesome as it's 2 smaller task that is focused on fear, can you stay in basically a room that can effect you to be scared, the second half is the ability to make your greatest fear come to life in a very small area. Harry ends up summoning 3 'monsters' one of which is the Balrog. Unfortunately it never gets completed but the story is pretty great

  The Sorting Hat serves more purposes than is apparent. One of them is as a safe guard against abusive families. What changes might be wrought from this? Rated for coarse language and mild violence.

** The Triwizard Tournament in The Pureblood Pretense series is almost entirely different, with six tasks and nine champions. However, in order to make sense of it, you'd need to read the first three fics in the series first (which I highly recommend anyway.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

** I agree with you. *The Lie I lived* is one of the best when it comes to the tournament. Another thing that I found nice about this fic was the totally logical and fair decision to add an additional champion for the other two schools.

** It's still a WIP, and the point I've read up to has only gotten through the tre-tournement tasks (the tournemant is 4 schools not 3 and is team based not individual), but it's was really good and I'm assuming the actual tournemant tasks will be really good too.

It's a story called "the odds were never in my favor"

** I've always loved the tasks in Silently Watches' Black Queen series.

First task is the same, second task is a wandless duel but other ways of casting magic is allowed.\\
Third task is similar to canon second task in that they have to fetch their hostage but it takes place in a giant 3d glass maze that has traps/creatures like canon third task.\\
There is an additional fourth task which is an obstacle course I guess? You have to make your way through all the rooms and all the champions end up in one big room where they have to fight to get to the cup in the center first.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

** There's one (I forget the name) where Harry secretly has Tom Riddle soulmark on him and Tom is a DADA professor. There were some unique Triwizard tasks there. One involved making a fortress I think. Some mental task was involved too.
