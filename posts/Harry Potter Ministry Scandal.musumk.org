The Daily Prophet Special

In a letter to the Daily Prophet Editor in Chief, the Boy Who Lived choose to express his view on the current ministry of magic.

I Harry James Potter, will say this : the incompetence of the minister of Magic Cornelius Oswald Fudge is so abysmal, that I would prefer to have Lord Voldemort as our Minister of Magic that Fudge.

We at the Daily Prophet are of the opinion that it only demonstrate the insanity of the problematic attention seeking brat.
