:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Harry drinks a potion that de-ages him about 10 years

Snape ends up raising him

Harry left a journal that Snape reads, Journal entries were a separate fic

I remember a particular scene where Ginny give Harry a journal and jokes that this one doesn't write back but Harry doesn't understand

Snape falls in love with a woman they save

The woman was described as having an Olive skin tone

They get a dog i think

There's another scene where Harry is drawing and Snape is disturbed by the picture.

I think they live by the ocean or a lake

I think Harry refers to Dumbledore as grandpa

Sorry if that not enough info. I've been trying to remember the name of the fic or find it but I can't
