Looking for a romance fic, no Harry/dumbledore/snape pairings, preferably 50k+ words, no crazy AUs. Thanks in advance y'all


** ‘My heart is a fist of barbed wire' and its sequel (sequel is a WIP getting regular updates)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18224369/chapters/43115984]]

The romance is with an OC - a muggleborn witch who grew up in the same orphanage as Tom. I adore the OC, she's a great contrast to Tom (at one point, she's described as a farmer's foot stomping fiddle to his elegant concerto violin). The relationship is well done too, and it doesn't shy away from the unappealing aspects of being with a narcissist like Tom. The author is one of my favourites - she's got some great A Song of Ice and Fire fics as well, if you are interested

*** I was just about to recc Barbed Wire! Can attest that the romance is excellent and the writing quality is top notch. One of my favorite Tom Riddle fics of all time

** Does it need to be complete? This is in progress. Last updated this month.

It's a self-insert, but she stays muggle so she isn't an overpowered Mary Sue or anything. She convinces Dumbledore that he should have done more to help Tom Riddle, so they use a time turner to take Diary Tom back to feel remorse and absorb the horcruxes. It doesn't work out so easy though. The time turner fucks up, it turns out Dumbledore was playing them the whole time (but without annoying bashing like in most fics), and there's the matter of how to get Voldemort's soul piece.

#+begin_quote
  The six devils of hell encompass all of the seven deadly sins. Each devil possess every sin in their being. But, six is such a terrible number. They are in search of a seventh. Tormenting human Jeongguk and making him fall sounds tempting.
