For once I'd love a learned magical to mercilessly crush the hopes of scientist!Harry/ whoever when they start thinking about it trying to apply the laws of physics to transfiguration or whatever. "The thing about magic is that it's fucking /magic/, kid."


** Science isn't just about physics. Hogwarts in itself is pretty scientific... The scientific method is about finding the laws/rules of how things work, by the model of hypothesis->experiment->(repeat x1000) -> theory.

Magic clearly follows some rules and logic or it would be completely arbitrary and random (no need to have a school or to come up with things like "Gamp's Law").

Common Witches and Wizards just don't seem to ask any of the important "why?" or "how?" questions in the books, it is all relegated to a handful of Unspeakables. The HP world sometimes reminds me of the times of Newton and others, when you could make a huge impact and research gains by just rigorously applying the scientific method. Back then you had people who were active in many fields at once, because they saw a problem and had an idea how to tackle it (completely out of the question nowadays, the obvious questions are already all answered or at least have been asked by someone much smarter than us). I sometimes feel the same with magic: The amount of hypothesis and experiments I'd like to perform on polyjuice alone is staggering.

*** Couterpoint to the not asking questions thing. How many people can tell you how their car works? What about their phone, hell most people have no idea how their toilet works.

I consider myself pretty handy but i cant tell you why the alternator works just that i can install a new one. Hell even though i know how a engine works as a concept i have no idea what kind of tolerances it requires. How much pressure is the engine block under and how does the fact it gets hot change that?

Most people dont know and dont care because its to much of a hassle. As long as i pour the dinosaur juice in and change the oil once in a while my horseless carriage gets me to and from work and that is all most people care about..

** I'd guess that it's because "It's magic, physics don't need to apply" and "it's conceptual" can render conflicts dull. Let's say we have "a Shield Charm protects. It's not a physical force - it's the concept of protection wrapped around the target". First, you have to decide what happens when someone sends a curse at someone under the shield charm's protection. We know the Unforgiveables don't care about the Shield Charm, and that Stunners and other curses do. But what happens to a gas attack? What happens if you start to remove all Oxygen in the room? What about falling damage? What about a landslide? Heat? Stench? How far does the concept of protection go? It doesn't protect against a basilisk's gaze, and a Nundu wouldn't be feared if a Protection Charm could stop its breath. But lesser versions of those attacks?

You have to make up a lot of decisions. But the real problem is that even if you do make all those decisions, they are usually not intuitive for everyone. Some readers will simply feel that you're arbitrally deciding what works and what doesn't work against a Shield Charm to suit your story. Unless you fill the story with a detailed analysis of the Shield Charm - which other readers might consider "wall of text" or "A Chekov Cannon".

On the other hand, if a Shield Charm is a physical semi-permeable barrier like Star Trek shields or even a medieval shield, you might have an easier time to make the readers understand and follow along in a fight as it deflects some attacks, but not others.

It's simply harder to get caught up in a battle where it's basically "my concept versus yours", instead of when spells are pitted against each other that have more defined and more intuitive limits. Turning the air around the enemy into poison gas forcing them to cast a Bubble-Head Spell or use a wind blast to disperse it is more colourful than having them counter it with yet another Shield Charm, just as they did to the wall of fire and the landslide.

Further, even if you assume that magic can do anything, that doesn't mean that its effects are also unlimited. If you conjure a wall of fire, does that consume oxygen as it burns? Does it emit heat in all directions? Does it come with a built-in "protect the caster from fire" effect? Does that work against fires started by the spell? What happens if you conjure a magical fire, and then turn the air around it into pure oxygen?

Basically, if magic can do anything without any care about physics (including its consequences, effects), it might end up too boring. So you add such limits. And then you might start extrapolating, and soon you're erring in the other extreme - turning magic into a wand-operated replicator from Star Trek.

The trick is finding a balance between too much and not enough "It's magic, kid".

To add to this, if your reader understands a spell/magic super well, it lets you play around with it in ways that make the reader go "wow, that's clever and well thought-out". A good example of this is Harry's scar and the horcrux connection. Harry and Voldemort's connection is well described through the series, Voldemort can possess Nagini and Harry both, the wand cores, etc.

And that's because Horcruxes are probably one of the most in-depth types of magic we learn about. The more you explain magic, the more cool moments you get like that.

Imo the right balance is when a few clever readers will be able to figure out solutions to the characters' problems with the tools you've given them, but not everyone can. An example where this didn't happen was literally every time Harry fights Voldemort and wins on luck alone. Imo something HPMOR did well is that the end (how Harry beats Voldemort) is something you totally could've seen coming and put together yourself, but it's clever enough that most people (me included) didn't.

*** If you give magic arbitrary pseudo-physical explanation, that's no better than giving arbitrary fully magical explanation. In fact as you can't make magic similar to the one in HP work with physics properly it's in fact even more arbitrary and less intuitive.

Actually at moments like that I wonder if you (and other people in similar cases) ever read any other fantasy than HP? More-or-less conceptual magic is pretty standard thing, even in xianxia (to say in HP fic terms, Chinese stories about making your magical core bigger) you have stuff like "the lotus sword formation channels the concept of lotus so I will sit and analyse lotuses to make it more powerful", or "I will use powerful magical things that represent the five elements to create five elemental magical tatoos to use them to bring myself to the next powerlevel", or "Now that I learned magical technique which was only partially preserved I can use my understanding of other techniques rooted in the same theory to fill the blanks". And that's one of the most popular webnovels in the genre (I Shall Seal the Heaven for those interested, though I don't recommend it, it falls apart later on). Clearly, people are able to understand things that aren't pseudo-physic.

** There's two schools of magic: the mysterious/mystical, and the super scientific. Tons of very legitimate writers are in both camps. Some examples are Lord of the Rings' and Star Wars for the first camp and Mistborn and Avatar for the second.

This sub tends to be super in the first camp. My personal opinion is that because the magic system in Harry Potter isn't super well defined, most hard-core fans of the series are people who like this kind of magic system.

I'm actually in the other camp and I love well-defined super strict magic. I know I'm in the minority here, but the magic system of Harry Potter was probably one of the biggest things I disliked about the series. It's also why some of my favourite series (Avatar, Fullmetal Alchemist, Mistborn) have very well-defined ones.

*** This is it exactly. It's also sometimes called "hard magic systems" and "soft magic systems." like hard and soft sci-fi referring to how rigidly the author adheres to the laws of the universe as we know them.

But it's less about science and more about whether the reader can predict it. Harry using an older spell in an unusual and creative way is hard magic. Harry learning a new spell that works because the book says so is soft magic.

Id love to read some actual hard magic hp fanfiction but it's rarely done well.

**** You might be into linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin). It's not super hard, but one of the things it attempts to do is make canon logically consistent.

Tons of things that don't make any sense in canon (why are the weasley's poor? why is making a horcrux so evil? how is Hagrid half giant if giants are 10x the size of people?) are explained. It isn't as hard as say Mistborn, but the author explores the myth and origins of magic a lot more.

Definitely a recommendation. Only caveat is year 1 sucks, but the rest makes up for it.

** No, you're not the only one. [[/u/Taure]]'s magical systems generally rely not on science, and for my current story I even plan magic to be impossible to quantify, but easy to qualify.

Sadly, there are not that many fics that dive into these aspects of magic. The Arithmancer for example annoys me with this. It's not photons at a certain wavelength that kill you, it's the basiliks' stare.

There are a few fics that do it differently, though.

In linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes) magic is more concept-based. In linkffn(Victoria Potter by Taure) Taure also delves into the magical system a bit. I don't recall more at the moment - if I find more, I'll edit it in.

The basilisk is a good example, but then later she also starts manufacturing diamonds and turns this into a little side business. Her talking about photons and atoms takes all the magic out of magic.

Think I finally gave up on the story when she decided to manufacture herself a sword, got Nearly Headless Nick to teach her how to use it and then started walking around Hogsmeade with it strapped to her waist for no reason and absolutely no other character seemed to find this odd.

No, it has to be the seeing of the basilisk's stare. Otherwise, mirrors and cameras wouldn't make a difference. That the stare could be blocked by glasses that "censor" the basilisk's eyes out of the picture---by whatever means---is a reasonable corollary.

** Here's the thing though, there are no laws governing science (except the scientific method, which has no reason to not apply to magic). Science is, by itself, the process of discovering the laws that govern the universe.

Magic still has rules, all it means is that instead of using the usual laws (gravity, electromagnetism, etc., etc.) you have to figure out new laws. I'm all for experimenting with spells you just have to throw your preconceptions of how things should work at the door.

(That said, even studying the interface of such areas do seem like a fascinating area of study: can you generate free energy using the Levitation Charm? Why doesn't 'artificial' electrical things work near magical concentrations but 'natural' electrical things do? If you had say, a spell that generated an electrical current, could you use it to power a circuit that'd work around magic?)

I love fiction works in general that will try to 'explain' magic and by that I mean not within a physical framework, but make a set of internal, well defined rules and if you prefer fiction works that just go "This is magic. No questioning allowed" that's fine, everybody has different tastes.

This is part of the reason HPMoR grew to become quite annoying to me - even though it pretends to be a science-y story after a while he barely experiments anymore, he just thinks about the answer really hard and he's right. All while using a ton of scientific jargon.

** I'm not super-annoyed by it. I feel more like magic without any limitations at all is boring. If there were absolutely no limits on magic, then what would be the point? Where's the struggle and the conflict? If there are no limits on magic, why are the Weasleys poor? Why do they have to use money for anything at all? Why do kids have to take a train to school? How inconvenient for Seamus's family who would have to travel all the way from Ireland to London just so he could go all the way up north to Scotland. Apparently there's some sort of limitations because the Weasleys have to use Ministry cars to get their brood to Kings Cross. Why don't they just side-along Apparate all of the kids and the gear?

Because if they did that, then we don't have the delightful scenes of an utterly bewildered Harry watching people run headlong at what looks like a solid brick wall and having to take his first leap of faith that magic works and he belongs in the magical world. We are not wizards, we are Muggles and we don't understand magic, but we do understand how physics works, so when Muggles like us write stories about magical things, we use limits and concepts that make sense to us. Otherwise, every story would be as such:

** The only time I apply actual science to Harry Potter is in genetics. I like to compare the magic gene to hemophilia (conceptually; it's not a point-to-point comparison). Thus most Muggleborns and Squibs can be traced back to an ancestor that's probably within the last three generations. Only in very rare cases is there a mutation that causes a Muggleborn or Squib.

Otherwise, as someone else said, the magic of Harry Potter is that it's /magic/. You can use the scientific method (make an observation and then experiment until you have enough evidence for a theory), but I don't recommend trying to apply physics to a world that exists outside of it.

A much better analogy for magic is Aristotelian physics - descriptive, qualitative, non-mathematical. In Aristole's system, rocks tend towards the earth because that's their natural place. Planets orbit in a circular motion because circles are the most perfect form of movement, existing in the eternal heavenly spheres etc. I've always felt that magical "science" could be worked out in an interesting way by modifying ancient and medieval natural philosophy, using human emotions as forces and so on. How about if major philosophers were squibs trying to figure out how things worked? Sadly, people want to square it with contemporary muggle science and make it boring.

I'm not particularly bothered if a character with a better grasp of physics figures out how to apply magic in innovative ways. Because magic or no magic physics still apply in the world, if not in the magic.

Someone mentioned The Arithmancer and Hermione's dealing with the Basilisk. From what I recall she made it so that she couldn't actually see its eyes by wearing those glasses. In a way, it's like she was blindfolded, except the blindfold only prevented her to see ther basilisk's eyes (and possibly other items of the same colour, I suppose). Whatever mystical and magical force is behind the basilisk killing stare, she's no more seeing its eyes than someone hiding behind a wall.

Another interesting thing was in HPMOR (yes I know most people seem to hate that fic in this subreddit but bear with me). In it people couldn't transfigure parts of items, only the whole. Whereas Harry figured out it was just a problem of conceptualizing. Since matter is made of atoms and whatnot.

So yeah, I find it mostly ok, unless it becomes just too much. Although I personally stil like better when magic is more volubile (?) and intangible than this.

** EEh, no that would be a pretty weak plot point to be honest. I find those types of fics interesting, especially if written well. Everything functions with rules somehow. It is within reason that if magic existed, it would follow it's own laws that may well mirror other scientific rules - or may not.

*** Canon certainly has laws for magic. Gamp's laws, for example.

** Yeah. It's /magic/, it's not /supposed/ to make sense!
