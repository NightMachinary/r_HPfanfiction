I mean, yeah the thrice defied him part was pretty clear. But it could also be that Tommy boy went to get a McDonald's Happy meal and it went like this.

"I want a happy meal."

"No, we're fresh out of happy meal."

"Ugh.. can I get a vanilla ice cream then?"

"Our Ice cream machine broke."

"Goddamn it! Just get me coke!"

"We don't have coke, is pepsi okay?"

Tom throws the menu card at the staff member, cutting deep in her head.

And there the staff member then goes on to give birth to a wizard/witch.

Seriously, it could have gone like that!


** It's a self-fulfilling prophecy so it's pretty much whoever Voldemort chose, but he's certainly not going to believe any muggle can defeat him. There weren't enough magical people who defied him /and/ live long enough to do so 2 more times. Now how many of those people were married with a baby on the way and due mid summer? So pretty easy really.

*** This and while Dumbledore himself never put any real belief behind the prophecy (unlike what fanon would have you believe), he knew that Voldemort would and did, and so planned around that fact accordingly.

** I really want to read a fic where everyone believes that Harry is the subject of the prophecy but he's not. Come the final battle someone completely random and unknown walks in kills Voldemort and walks out. It can't be forshadowed either. The whole fic you also believe the prophecy is about Harry and then bam it's not.

*** Read one a while back that did that, and it was amusing.

Actual 'boy who lived' was the son of a Scots muggleborn whose parents stood up to Tom at Hogwarts, and whose entire family left the wizarding world entirely during Voldemort's first war and moved to Australia after his father was killed.

He didn't get along with his eventual stepfather, so he ended up enlisting in the UK military. Eventually happened to be in the right place at the right time when the Ministry of Magic asked for help from their mundane counterparts, and was part of the team that got sent in to put Voldemort down. So the 'boy who lived' turned out to be a middle-aged career NCO.

*** That's all a bit Deus ex Machina - in the bad, modern sense - and would be thoroughly unfulfilling for the reader, even if also thoroughly believable.

*** that would be narratively unsatisfying. That's, in essense, including a plot twist for the sake of having a plot twist. That's the equivalent of how D&D ended season 8: no foreshadowing, no buildup, no point whatsoever. It cheapens the triumphs, the sacrifices, and loses that the protagonist and his allies had; and while life is unfair, /stories/ are *not* real life. You read fiction /because/ it's different from real life.

Now, as a one-shot crackfic where the ending is spoiled in the title or description, hat could work; but it's essentially a fic built upon a one-line joke.

** Author fiat, although it does lend support to the tiny, tiny size of the Wizarding world.

Given that there were ~600 kids born a day in the UK in the early 80's, and the prophecy doesn't exactly state a date...

**** Yeah, hence why it illustrates how small the wizard population really is if you can narrow down the couples who fought against a terrorist and had a kid in the back half of July that year to two.

****** He still spent seven years in Hogwarts, with pretty much the entirety of the UK's magical children. The number of people who've traded spells with him and not died has to be fairly significant.
