:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I am looking for a particular series where each fic was characters reading one of the books. It is possible that it was all one fic, but I remember them being separated.

Things I remember:

- The books were being read in the Great Hall of Hogwarts. The students were all present, and others (including at least the Weasleys, and some of the Order)

  - There were no dead characters (James, Lily, Alice, etc...) present.

- There are a number of instances where someone comments on how powerful/special/unique Harry is as a wizard.

  - Example: When Harry walks into Ollivanders in the first book and feels the magic in the air.

- Daphne Greengrass starts to interact with Harry, with the author flirting at a pairing between the two, but it had not yet happened as of my last reading.

  - Ginny was flirting with Harry as well.

- Some of the lines in the books where Ron is complaining about feeling under-appreciated/poor/invisible in his family are read in front of his family and they resolve to be nicer to him
- Draco gets called out for baiting Harry (several times I think)

I can tell you it is not A Dramatic Reading by White Squirrel (which is awesome btw, and I recommend it) or its sequel A Sensational Story by Srikanth1808 (not complete yet, but still awesome)
