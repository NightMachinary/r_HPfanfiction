Harry trying to do evil but it's actually something good like he tries to take over the ministry of magic by killing fudge and umbridge publicly turns out they had both been running underground creature killing rings so Harry's hailed as even more a hero

** He also kills Snape, knowing his value as a spy, but the sheer number of people who hate Snape results in more praise then condemnation.

He decides to try and cross the moral event horizon by forcing his school rival's love interest, Astoria, into a marriage with himself against her will, only to discover that this is her dream come true and her sister erroneously assumes that Harry had somehow found out and decided to rescue Astoria from a loveless arranged marriage, crowing that belief to the heavens and destroying any chance Harry could use the marriage for negative PR. Astoria then misinterprets his confession of his evil intent of forcing her as a dom/sub kink... and she confesses to having sub fantasies.

Harry tries tossing Fiendfyre into a Wizengamot meeting. Unbeknownst to him, all the good-aligned members had been indisposed due to machinations of the dark-aligned members, so everyone assumes he was just clearing house. He then tries this again with Fortescue's only for nobody to get hurt and Florean's insurance policy to let him rebuild bigger and better then ever, gaining him even more positive PR (albeit with more sly winks and him being assigned a fine for arson).

EDIT: >100 upvotes?! Now I'm tempted to try my hand a lemon of the 2nd idea just for a giggle... which would probably lasso Daphne into a threesome for the 2nd round (out of fear that their dad might get pressured to legally change Daphne's name to Astoria just to let Draco get some, cause I'd go the route of Draco taking an unbreakable vow that the only woman he will ever sleep with will be Astoria Malfoy nee Greengrass as the betrothal is being signed to paint the target on Astoria's back so to speak)...

**** Unfortunately, the method he'd been planning - a controllable romance - is no longer on the table, and with a very grateful pureblood wife who will alert Harry of any obvious threats from the Wizengamot, he now has no option but to be either extremely subtle, or very direct.

So he tries to guilt Harry with talk about how his parents would be horrified at him committing murder, and then to Dumble's horror Harry destroys the Little Hangleton cottage... and is praised for moving on by the public.

He then tries to appeal to Harry's hero complex by revealing the prophecy and Scarcrux, and Harry reacts by laughing, grabbing Astoria (who he's become fond of), and leaving the country, gleefully announcing to Diagon Alley as he leaves with all their money withdrawn from Gringotts that Voldemort can have Britain for all he cares because of how bad he was treated during 2nd, 4th, and 5th years, and announces that the Minister can duel Voldemort next time. The press paints this as Harry triumphantly deciding to refuse to allow an older man obsessed with a younger boy to control his destiny.

Harry also finds an expert outside of the UK who is able to actually do something about it without killing Harry.

This also galvanizes the people to take action against Voldemort and the Death Eaters far more than before, resulting in slaughters during every DE raid on a magical target (akin to those seen in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8560964/1/Death-of-a-Hero][Death of a Hero]]), the difference being that it's not Harry who kills Tommy Boy, but the Minister, who Dumbledore tells of the Prophecy and convinces that Harry's declaration designated the Minister as Harry's "right hand man" for the purpose of the killing blow, and it works (or maybe the prophecy was fake the whole time?).

As for the Horcruxes, they don't work this time because the magic is extremely limited in scope (hence why we're not swimming in ancient Egyptian immortal god-wizards).

  Sirius breaks out of Azkaban two years before schedule. He's pissed, half-mad and prepared to do anything to protect his Godson. He's going to make the Wizarding world pay for the hell it put him through- and have some fun along the way, of course! Super! Sirius, Dark Lord! Sirius, but not evil. No slash. May include ships later. Mainly from Sirius' (and Harry's) point of view. AU.

  Harry has reached a very bitter and jaded thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the corruption or pure-blood bigotry one bit. That's when he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of before; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear the system down and salt the earth. And with a double Lordship, he just might have the power to do that.
