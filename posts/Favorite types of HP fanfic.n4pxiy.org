The kinds of fanfic that you are always on the look out for ?

I for example am always interested in Marauders centric stories during the first war.

Adult Sirius centric stories where he doesn't die ( that aren't about him in a parental role or him being paired with a oc or a character who is a oc in everything but their name)

And Tom Riddle mc/pov stories that are less dark and edgy and more about seeing him interact with people in a neutral or positive way and are less romance focused ( or no romance with Riddle)

What about you guys?

*** Would you like to link some of what you consider the best of these?

I thought [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19334905/chapters/45993925][Messing With Time]] was enjoyable. The author is competent, the prose workable, but I wouldn't consider it a gem of a fic. More like a ... very smooth rock.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25236877][Three Hallows, a Rat, and Redemption]] is good. Interesting premise, that Peter is reincarnated as Harry. Sort of. I recommend it.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13978644][Resurrect The Living]] is another that's fun, but not exactly a literary masterpiece.

********* If I may suggest The Archeologist? Technically it's dimensional travel, but there's only a couple significant changes between universes (and really only significant in how directly they affect Harry [well, both Harry's]) and it takes a full established adult Harry back to 1992. So in effect it's a time travel fic with added flavor.

 

And I guarantee this Harry doesn't follow the normal "PeggySue!Harry" checklist. (Yes technically there are crossovers listed but you don't need to know anything about Bloodborne or Sword Art Online)

*** Ok tbh I am way more forgiving of this for stories in Harrys gen than Marauders . And its entirely because of what I read for both those types of stories.

Because I read alot of stories in Harry's gen where its very necessary to flesh out a supporting set of characters that had no personalities in canon. Like in Slytherin Harry AUs you would need alot of support character Slytherins to be friends or just give a better idea of what the house is like. Since Slytherin Harry is a popular au they keep being built on fleshed out and some eventually reach a level of consistency on what they are like. They end up feeling more like existing support characters than ocs. And so it just feels right when people start shipping them.

But for Marauders centric stories ( the ones i like anyway) alot of these focus very much on just the relations between Marauders and Lilly. There maybe some other characters like Snape and his friends as antagonists but that basically it. So when a super minor character or a character only name dropped once gets shipped with say Sirius it just feels like they exist just to give Sirius a girlfriend and I don't care.

Because unlike say in Slytherin Harry where I was interested to see Harry be in Slytherin and see his relationship with other Slytherins and how he functions in the house, I just wanted to see the Marauders relationships to each other while they undergo challenges. So I don't care about the ocs or any relationship with a marauder and a oc or basically oc then üòÖ

*** On one hand, Tom is often portrayed as someone who sees all love as a weakness and is obviously evil, with the implication that if he could feel love then he would be more. "normal". That goes into a lot of negative ace and aro stereotypes, a megalomaniac is not the representation we want or need. Also, aro people feel love just not...romantically? You can love your friends and family just as strong.

I don't like bashing, but i like H/Hr so that ends up being inevitable.\\
On this oneself esteem test i was given, I wrote that my greatest strength is adaptiveness; cause I can roll with the punches, watching the Weasleys get bashed in one fic and praised in the other.

**** Sorry I'm late but To Fight The Coming Darkness is a pretty great action-centric dark-fic. It starts with a simultaneous attack on Harry and all his friends while they're home for the summer, and spins out into covering the war from many angles. The Author is a lorehound, which is sometimes tiring and comes off as yet another fic author trying to flex how much smarter they are than Rowling. But, this is also a great thing,since the author comes up with loads of great ideas for wards and battle scenes. The constant introduction of new concepts and fleshing out minor characters also does well in making it feel like the war is heating up and has a lot of people's lives at stake.He takes the characters in weird directions (Neville's arc is unbelievable),but I found it weirdly engaging as well, since it was unpredictable has the very rare-pairing of Harry and Susan Bones Linkffn(To Fight The Coming Darkness)

Two Steps From Hell by ssserpensssotia is a Tom/Hermione fic. I clicked on it out of morbid curiosity, thinking it would suck, but it surprised me all through.Voldy finds out about the Horcruxes after Hermione is accidentally made one.He has to now keep her alive and gradually they fall for each other.It showed an almost appealing vision of the Death Eaters winning.Not doom and gloom and creepy manors,but parties, drugs and apartments in Venice,which seemed in line with how death eaters would act after winning, and really reminds me of the movie Cruel Intentions. It shows Hermione starting to struggle with her morality after spending too much time with Tom, his Inner Circle, and a now jaded, drug-addicted Harry.I loved how even though they were attracted to each other,(especially after Voldy gives Death back the hallows and gets back his good looks),there was still the tension of them being mortally opposed, as well as the fact that Hermione was, at the end of the day, his prisoner. Her friendship with Harry is as heartfelt as in canon, albeit in a dark, twisted way. It ends in a mind-blowing way. Linkffn(Two Steps From Hell)

Recnac Transfaerso by Celebony. It's premise is that Harry is back at Privet Drive, and for once a Muggle family moves in that treats him well. He grows close to them, and soon finds out that the father has been diagnosed with late-stage cancer. In his typical self-sacrificing way, Harry manages a spell to transfer the cancer to himself. The story then focuses on Harry going back to Hogwarts running on borrowed time, the character's reactions as everybody gradually finds out, and Harry's relationship to them all. It's a really old fic, and has this air of freeness, like its not weighed down by fanon tropes or even by complete canon Linkffn(Recnac Transfaerso)

**** No! More along the lines meta fics, and "what-if's". Fics that look at a character's motivations and personhood and dissects it.

While they /can/ fall into authors' rants, it's more of a kind rant. a happy one. it's your friends excitedly telling you about their favorite hobby, where you can see their entire face light up.

My favorite examples are....a lot. But my tops picks are things like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13760487/chapters/31624473][The Dogfather]] which is not /too/ meta at first, but by the time you get to the last installment in the series obviously almost an essay about fandom, canon, and how we interact with it. And it's beautiful.

/"In the best of all possible worlds, there would never be a need for Harry to walk into the Forbidden Forest with a Snitch clutched in his hand and dread coiled around his heart."/

‚Äã

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24174838/chapters/58222408][A question of ethics]] is also great, it can act as a study between the relationship between Tom Riddle and Dumbledoor. But it also asks questions that the audience would ask, and explores those concepts. While the original soft magic system in the books was certainly whimsical there plenty of holes or throwaway lines that have disturbing implications that the audience is left to fill in the gaps for.

‚Äã

/‚ÄúWould you say a Transfigured animal is alive, sir?‚Äù/

/Dumbledore showed no outward sign of discomfort when he replied, ‚ÄúIt depends on how you define life, Mister Riddle, though the short answer is No. Adalbert Waffling wrote a rather seminal paper on just the subject, if you are so interested--‚Äù/

/‚ÄúSo a Transfigured animal cannot die?‚Äù interrupted Tom./

/‚ÄúIt can be reverted to its original form,‚Äù said Dumbledore. ‚ÄúYou shall learn Untransfiguration in your second year--‚Äù/

/‚ÄúBut surely a Master of Transfiguration such as yourself can create an animal so life-like that it may as well be the real thing,‚Äù insisted Tom. ‚ÄúTo the degree that if one should cut it, it would bleed--‚Äù/

/‚ÄúAn unusually cruel notion,‚Äù murmured Dumbledore./

‚Äã

And of course [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5147618][Eleven Up]] is a prime example of this!

/In 1990, prominent Muggleborn research wizard Cromwell Albertson embarked on an ambitious project to interview six Muggle-born students -- before and after their life-changing discovery of their wizarding talent. He continued these interviews over the next nine years, a period of time which spanned both the Chamber of Secrets attacks in 1992 and Voldemort's second rise and subsequent persecution of Muggleborns in 1997./

I could rave on for it for days, but it's a great analysis on the effects of trauma in youth, what it means to be normal, what it means to be /not normal,/ and highlights some characters that did not get much forefront in the books or by most of the fandom.

‚Äã

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1855237][Methods of Humanity]] was originally written as a character study on Tom Riddle/Voldemort/You-know who/Thomas Gaunt. While the plot expanded as the series progressed, its roots in what monster-hood is, how mortality helps us, and choosing your own identity carry throughout the entirety of it.

My favorite quotes form are probably;

/"Tom Riddle was never taught to live -- he had to learn from scratch."/

/"At some point, Tom Riddle forgot how to be a human. Learning again is difficult, but Lord Voldemort can do anything he puts his mind to."/

It's not everyone's cup of tea and I would not recommend it to everyone unlike the other three, but its in-depth exploration of Voldemort's image of himself is incredible.

‚Äã

Every single installment in the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/285498][Boy with a scar]] is great by every standard, but my favorite parts are where the author directly speaks to /us/ the audience like this is more of a conversation rather than a written work. It dares to ask "What if? which is the question that probably inspires half of all fanfics, but the way dirgewithoutmusic explores the concepts is lovely.

"/you know what would have been great? if ron got sorted into slytherin./

/imagine-- we have this kid on the train, the first friend harry meets, with his corned beef sandwiches and smudged nose. ron is eleven years old and he wants gryffindor, because he's a weasley and that's what always happens. but it doesn't happen./

/what a way to redeem slytherin house-- or, god, at least complicate it. because ron is petty. he is mean and sharp and ambitious and jealous-- and he is loyal to the ends of the earth. he is all those things, and he is and always has been good."/

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17574581][Doubt tho the stars are fire]] is great as well, or at least if enjoy Sirius. It's an exploration of his relationship with his family, and a critique on the definition of Slytherin.

/"(In another life, perhaps he was more like Andromeda. Perhaps he rebelled, lived his life bright and loud and brave and Gryffindor. But in this life, Sirius Black decided that surviving was more important to him than living , and he adjusted his actions accordingly.)"/

‚Äã

Anyways! I could go on for hundreds of fics that make the english-major in me squeal in delight, but I have only been typing for a few minutes and this comment already seems absurdly long. I just really like fanfiction.

** Angsty whumpy stories. Generally about society and problems in it. Something with witty, sarcastic writing and a just a dark sense of humour.

Usually these tend to be stories following Remus or Sirius after the war. Sirius dealing with Azkaban, Remus dealing with being a werewolf in an intolerant society.

I don't like romance or fluff or anything remotely piney or sappy. However, sadly most stories insist on having some romantic pairing in them. If it's done well and compliments a more plot/adventure focussed story then yeah sure but, I have no patience watching people be happy.

I think that's why I don't mind Wolfstar? Because generally, the two lads are so sad and tortured and depressed that there's rarely any romance and in their partnership? It's more desperation which is sad and interesting to read. For me anyway üòä.

*** So I started reading through your blog post (and the posts linked from that, creating an ever-growing spiral of tabs to distract me from work today, thanks for that!), and I really must say, as much as I do enjoy the style of realism you're describing: why not engage with characters like Tom Riddle and Albus Dumbledore in realistic stories grounded in normal human experiences?

I'm hugely biased by these two being among my favorite characters. I write for one, and I will eventually write for the other. Throw Gellert Grindelwald in there, because why not and he's definitely of the same character archetype, and you've got a trio of my faves including one of my favorite ships in the game (Grindeldore).

Humanizing the ultra-powerful people that drive much of the core HP series plot is wonderful fun. And we know so much about them that would make them perfect fodder for this sort of realism! Tom Riddle worked as a shop clerk for around a decade! Albus Dumbledore was just a schoolteacher for multiple decades! Even during the heights of their power, they must have daily routines, they must have space for compelling character growth---and that's to say nothing of adding in canon divergence that opens up opportunities for even more realism.

With Tom, I've always felt that writing him in really mundane situations focusing on character growth is exciting because his character has so much room to grow. Dumbledore, though not starting from the same place, has much of his own baggage to work out. If anything, I want more realistic stories about the unremarkable parts of their lives.

#+end_quote

You mean the non-magic AU? That's a fair question, I suppose, but I have to add completely against any theory, that the magic is fun. Also, the magical community has additional advantages: very small universe, which is easier to grasp (and describe) than the endless complexities of Muggle universe, and it feels more gem√ºtlich (cosy? G. K. Chesterton claimed there is no good translation into English). I am also thinking about the simplicity and directness of the Western cowboy stories --- probably not because everybody is as heavily armed as anybody else, but mostly because for small and more simple universe. Dreaming about the simple life.

There is probably even some relationship to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Herriot][James Herriot]] and ‚ÄúIt Shouldn't Happen to a Vet‚Äù and sequels. That kind of feeling.

That humanization element is for example the reason why I liked ‚ÄúInterwoven: The Seamstress and the Lovable Stray‚Äù linkffn(714431) before it turned into the ultra-sugary romance, which I didn't like that much.

****** Well, it is teenage/young-adults adventure story, so you need some adversary, and it is quite often a bildungsroman so The Hero's Journey with The Great Teacher is quite appropriate as well. But if you ask, why we don't have more realistic descriptions of both non-crazy Voldemort, and failing but more or less honest Dumbledore, it is just because it is very hard to write it, and most fanfiction authors are not very good, being amateurs.

******* I'm not really asking why it doesn't exist, more so lamenting that it doesn't and commenting on your choice to exclude those two particular characters from the stable of available people to write these sorts of low-stakes, human stories about.

Much of my reading energy goes toward hunting these fics down, and all of my writing energy is poured into it, and I do find myself quite fulfilled. Just, like any fan of niche content, I wish it were more prevalent so I would have more to enjoy and more people with whom I could talk about it.

I haven't done anything like that. I don't know many about Tom/Dumbledore's normal life stories, true (there are some small exceptions), but I like for example a sad alone misunderstood Dumbledore in ‚ÄúHonour Thy Blood‚Äù linkffn(12155794), because he seems to be a way more realistic than super!Dumbledore and especially than bashed!Dumbledore.

*** /" What I mean, is that the magic there seemed to me like something external bolted on the top of the story, not inherent to the universe heroes of the story lived in."/

I mean you are absolutely right I think this is another reason i dislike the super genius MC becomes brilliant op or hyper intelligent witch/wizard stories where they logic out magic/make it scientific or hack wizard politics as preteens type stories

There are many issues I have with the hp series but what did and still does resonate with me boils down to two factors.

The awe and wonder of experiencing a magical fantasy world thats a bit absurd

and seeing these characters grow and struggle and overcome challenges unique to who they are so seeing them succeed and be happy resonates.

The super logical scientific interpretation of the magical world takes away alot of that awe wonder and absurdity imo.

And the hyper competent and powerful mc doesn't feel very compelling. Im watching to see how he/she solves the next obstacle. I don't care about characterization or character growth because the character doesn't need to grow and who they are doesn't matter how strong or smart they are is what does.

I don't care as much about side chatacters or relationships because the story is focused on the cool ways the mc ( or sometimes main ship) can come out seeming cool strong and smart. No matter who the supporting cast is they aren't going to be more competent or powerful. So in a story like this they dont really matter outside of maybe some fun dialogue.

To me personally I get bored pretty quick.

Which is honestly a shame because I do like smart characters and I have seen stories where smart characters who have to fight using their intelligence but the set up still makes them struggle the supporting characters have important contributions and character growth is still very important. And even fanfics like that but its not really common and now i side eye powerful or competent mcs in hp fics.

That's IMHO the fatal flaw of almost all Harmony stories. Purely on abstract theoretical level I can accept that Harmony is perhaps possible, or (given [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/whats-wrong-with-ginny.html][how poorly Ginny is written in the books]]) or even more probable, but the execution almost universally sucks.

***** Its funny cuz Harmony is what turned me bitter in the first place lol

I liked the idea of power fantasies when I first started reading hp fics and i liked fixit stories and Slytherin or Dark Harry just because it was new to me at the time. And alot of them were Harmony and had all the problems I was talking about.

Plus they kinda took away alot of the unique interesting things about Hermione's characterization to make her a powerfantasy. Though tbh they arent the only ship that does that to Hermione.

They did similar things with Harry but Hermione was more of a fav to me than Harry so that bothered me more.

So I guess, angst?
