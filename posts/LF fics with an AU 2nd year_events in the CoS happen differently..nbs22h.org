Like the title says

Preferably no major character bashing.

For specific requests: any more humorous takes of the encounter with Diary!Tom? Any where the Diary isn't destroyed/Harry reveals he's aware of it being a Horcrux? Oh, and any where the Basilisk survives?

Thanks guys!


** I want to see some stories where there's no damn plot armor, so you actually get the basilisk munching on some students and they actually lose people. Maybe Harry has to cope with losing a classmate, like Dean or something. Or make it Hermione, and she just didn't think of the mirror idea in time and got killed off in the library.

*** There was this fic, Haryr Potter and the Game where Dean dies. They were working on a project together with some other people and after Dean dies, they all lose motivation for it. Sadly I don't think it will update anytime soon but it is still a good read

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] has some memorable quotes during the COS event such as:

#+begin_quote
  "You stop this nonsense and get back in your diary, young man."
#+end_quote

And

#+begin_quote
  It was a necessary evil. I had enough competition without another me running around.
#+end_quote

Later:

#+begin_quote
  "Of course I am," Ginevra said. "I command the Basilisk."

  She hissed, "Come." Or possibly "Strangle." Her accent was terrible. The Basilisk slithered towards us, students scrambling out of its way. It came to rest beside Ginevra, eyes closed and waiting for instructions.

  "Go sleep twice," Ginevra said. "Only need look terrifying."

  I would like to reiterate the horror that was Ginevra Weasley attempting to speak Parseltongue. The Basilisk silently accepted this butchery of the language, returning to an empty corner where it curled into a ball.

--------------

Some fics don't even have CoS event happening, such as in extreme AUs [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]]. Harry wasn't even at Hogwarts (and Ginny neither in the second fic). The Diary was found out and destroyed in very different ways.

Being a proud Parselmouth, Harry quickly told others about hearing the hissing sound in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/Petunia-Evans-Tomb-Raider][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]], so they identified it was a Basilisk quite early. Ginny didn't get the Diary either.

In the Lockhart raised Harry fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate][When in Doubt, Obliviate]], the Diary was resolved in a totally different fashion.

CoS still went on as in canon in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/Petrification-Proliferation][Petrification Proliferation]], but its aftermath is completely different.
