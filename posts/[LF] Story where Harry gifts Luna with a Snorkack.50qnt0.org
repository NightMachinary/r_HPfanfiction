linkffn(11898648)\\
Took me quite a bit of time to find this. Had to CTRL + F "snorkack" every chapter of several fics because I honestly couldn't remember which fic the scene is from. Hope this is the fic you're looking for.\\
Edit: Chapter 19: Freedom Fun if you need the specific chapter.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

  The Lone Traveler arrived just in time to prevent a major diplomatic incident. Rigged tournament, Evil Dumbledore, etc. A typical Fix it - Until a certain Goddess decided to get involved. Now Harry has to go all over creation to satisfy the devious little Deity while satisfying a Veela, helping to kill Voldemort, etc. Blame FairyWm for the Snorcacks.

  Harry has died, again. This is his last shot, his last chance before he gets written off forever. This is his 48th life. But he is not alone, the game plan has changed and he's got a plan to fix everything. Hopefully while avoiding dying again. Death at his shoulder. Warnings language and possible mature situations later.
