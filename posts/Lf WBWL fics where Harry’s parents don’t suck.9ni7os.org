  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** /Antihyphen/ isn't really WBWL, but Harry has a twin sister and James and Lily treat them both equally fair. Sadly, it's been abandoned. It's still a fun fic, though.
