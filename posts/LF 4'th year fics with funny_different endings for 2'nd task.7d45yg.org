Im looking for fics where Harry saves Hermione from the bottom of the lake, and all the chaos that follows because he didnt save Ron ^{^}

Besides the above im looking for fics where Harry doesnt do the tasks as he is supposed to, or does them in funny humorous ways :)


** linkffn(Seventh Horcrux)'s way of solving the Second Task is certainly......different.

  With one last Avada Kedavra in Voldemort's direction, I sprinted away, headed towards the graveyard's gates.

  However, I took a small detour to grab the Cup because it was mine. As I snatched its handle, something tugged at my navel and the world began to spin, eventually solidifying into the familiar grounds of Hogwarts.

  Greeted by the surprised faces of my teachers and classmates, I knew immediately that I had to tell them. After all, I knew something incredibly important, something that mattered. I could not allow them to wallow in ignorance for a moment longer.

  I held my trophy aloft and shouted, "I declare victory!"

Fucking lol.

And then Harry's insistence that Voldemort's rebirth was all a part of the task. I love how delusional Harry is.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

** This one is great. Harry is unable to get the Gillyweed and attacks Bagman, saying it's a hostage exchange:

  One-shot. Harry suspects the Second Task will involve hostages, but he still can't find a way to breathe underwater. In his desperation, what other options might he devise?

** linkffn(The Lone Traveler: Cockups and Snorkacks) Harry is prevented from saving Gabrielle, and that's when The Lone Traveler gets involved. Karkaroff is redeemed, Dumbledore... not so much.

And then the Celtic Pantheon shows up.

  The Lone Traveler arrived just in time to prevent a major diplomatic incident. Rigged tournament, Evil Dumbledore, etc. A typical Fix it - Until a certain Goddess decided to get involved. Now Harry has to go all over creation to satisfy the devious little Deity while satisfying a Veela, helping to kill Voldemort, etc. Blame FairyWm for the Snorcacks.
