** Just where do you find these fics?

Just off the top of my head, you've got widely read and prolific writers like Robst, James Spookie, Rorschach's Blot, Kwan Li^{1}, LordsFire, as well as almost all WBWL fics, where Hermione can't wipe her arse without Harry having to rescue her from the Toiler Paper Tentacle Monster.

I can only think of a handful of writers who overdo it the other way. (Pstibbons? ChemProf?)

^{1} --- Well, Kwan Li isn't as egregious, but still...

** Not sure I agree. I read a lot of H/Hr and in most Hermione becomes some kind of damsel that Harry has to rescue or he educates her about house elves and she has to learn not to trust authority so much from him.

I actually find what you describe to be quite refreshing... when she retrains her argumentative and unyielding character and doesn't just roll over for Harry because they're in luv.

Being in a committed and equal relationship is the opposite of independent. That's why in indie!Harry fics he either stays single or gets some bimbo who adores him to follow him around and respect all his wishes.

** My impression is the opposite. In far too many Harmony fics I've read, Hermione is the love interest/moral support/damsel in distress while Harry's the one in charge, versed in pureblood culture, politics, and combat, and at least her equal in intellect. I guess it's a matter of bias.

In my opinion, balancing the two depends on the plotline. Hermione is smarter than Harry, so any plot that focuses on intellectual challenges will favour her. On the other hand, any plot that has a lot of combat can easily see Harry dominating the story. If you have a competent Dumbledore, it gets even more difficult since he'll both protect Harry far more efficiently, therefore keeping Harry from shining in combat, and solve intellectual problems at the same time, rendering Hermione's strongest talent less useful.

With regards to Hermione dominating the relationship, I think that happens a lot if Harry sticks too closely to canon - in canon, he was often bland and reactive (outside, say Quidditch), while Hermione had the drive and passion to be proactive (and the tendency to try and solve others' problems whether she was asked to or not).

** I have exactly the opposite experience in that I usually see Harry being dominant in the relationship (although she does tend to be much smarter), and I mostly stick to H/Hr stories. You're right about relationships (good ones anyway) needing equality and balance though

** In my understanding the most of fanfic authors are teenage and early 20s females.

Therefore it's either the Knight in the Shining Armour or the Girl that Gets Everything (disregarding what she truly does).

** My theory is that the movies are responsible. Movie Hermione is a superhero with next to no flaws, and those she does have don't affect her at all.

Putting anyone besides movie Hermione and they pale in comparison by default.

Then you have Harry ending up with Ginny when the movies don't develop her at all and have a lot of 'moments' between Harry and Hermione. It's basic wish fulfillment, but I suppose all fanfiction is so, in the end.

*** Well, even in the books she barely is portrayed with flaws, save for being a know-it-all (not a terrible flaw). Even her deference to authority is kind of subverted by the fact that she's always breaking the rules (and even the law) with Harry. Pottermore makes this even more clear when her skills are summarized as "Almost everything", lmao. That's probably why some see her as a bit of an SI of JKR's.
