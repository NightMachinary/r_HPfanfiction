Hi British friends! Just a quick question - have tried to google it but could not get a straight answer: what do you call the place that looks after kids during the day, when they're aged 6months to 3-ish years old (so before “proper” school starts)?

Here in Ireland we call it “creche” and /usually/ we have the same words/spelling but I've seen Americans call it “day care” and suddenly I have a doubt.

Many thanks!


** Usually "nursery", where I come from!

*** Right! I don't know why, I somehow knew “creche” would be an Irish-ism! Thanks a mil!

** Nursery, although as someone else already mentioned, I think having a childminder is also a possibility.

** At an actual school, it's Nursery, but it's not compulsory til year 1. Instead they'll be in a Nursery school which is just like a preschool as not attached to a primary.
