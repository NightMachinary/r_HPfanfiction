** Lolol I don't think his family lifted a single finger to help him. His mother was alive too, and I'm sure she thought he deserved it after leaving their family.

I've always been a little piqued that Andromeda didn't try to help him, but I suppose the evidence against him seemed pretty solid

**** That and I think a few other factors play in. Like @wyanmai and @Kininger625 stated, Sirius and his family hated each other (minus Andromeda) and Andromeda has to look out for her family first and foremost. You're right that she probably was of the belief that Sirius was guilty. The evidence against Sirius is too much and no one else knew of the switch. Another factor is that Andromeda was disowned by the Blacks. Even if she wanted to, it was her word against the Black family. A very powerful family along with other families that most likely supported them (Malfoy, Nott, Lestrange,). Even if Sirius got a trial and Andromeda was able to sway some favor against sending him to prison, the blacks and their supporters would probably bribe others to get Sirius in jail.

** I could ask you why Arcturus should care about what happen to this grandson who forsook his family by running away in the night and going to live with another family. I could also ask you what make you think that Arcturus could have done anything (they were just a wealthy pureblood family, no the royalty of Magical Britain.

​

But I'll rather just ask you this : Why bother?

To the general knowledge, Sirius just disappeared the night Voldemort was vanquised, and only resurfaced 5 days later, when he killed one of his supposed best friend, who had just accused him of having betrayed the Potter, as well as tens of muggles. Add at that the fact that Albus Dumbledore himself can swear that Sirius was the Potters Secret Keeper (since it's what they told him), and that only him could have told Voldemort their location, and his trial would be a formality.\\
I know that some people like to use the "Veritaserum" card, but as Rowling said, the potions as flaws. Sirius was probably talented enough to use some of the ways she mentioned, like transfiguring the potions into water when it reachs his lips, or he could have used the 5 days he disappeared to change his memory and say "his" truth to the jury. But even without any of that, it would have just taken one jury yelling "/He was You-Know-Who right hand man, he must have taught him some of his tricks/" to make him appear guilty no matter what.

So why would Arcturus use a lot of his potential ressources and favor to give Sirius a trial, when it would just have found him guilty in 5 minutes, and even have the risk to change his sentence from a life sentence to the kiss?

**** That may be true, but I prefer a flimsy excuse to letting such a game breaking thing in the story. But anyways, "it can beaten on the spot" is only a secondary argument. The main arguments are still people refusing to be subjected to the potion, and memory manipulation.

People don't want to have all of their deepest secrets made public in front of a jury, and the few who ask for the potion would seem suspectfull because they are the exception, they may want the potion because they prepared against it.

Veritaserum make people say what he thinks is the truth. Under the potion, Morfinn Gaunt would admit killing the Riddles, Mrs Smith Elf would say she poisoned her, and Stan Shumpkin would explain how he tried to kill Harry Potter the night of his 17th birthday. All of them were innocent of their crimes but had their memory modified or were under the Imperius. Sirius had 5 days to change his before his arrest. Nothing he would say could have been trusted.

*** I always thought there was an implication the Black family was seriously abusive. Cutting Andromeda out like that and Bellatrix willingly killing her kin, Wahlburga screaming abuse and doing crazy shit to Sirius and trying to force her kids--not even Hogwarts grads---to join Voldmort, etc. Also, it might have been a fuck up by JK but I think the Black family tree has Andromeda, Bellatrix, and Narcissa's parents getting married when they are like 14 of all things. Doesn't one of them get completely cut out of the family simply for helping Sirius?

So yeah...it makes sense that this crazy, magically racist and incest ridden and possibly sexually abusive crazy family, wouldn't lift a finger to someone they saw as a 'traitor" to his family regardless of his innocent or guilt.

**** I'm not sure the family was /that/ bad, sure they were a bunch of blood purists and bigots, but we have to remember that we only have Sirius side of the story, not to mention he spent 13 years in Azkaban and must have lost any good memory he had with his family.\\
Anyways concerning the points you made :

- Andromeda ran off to marry a Mudblood. From the Black point of view, what's pretty much the worst thing she could have done. Not a good family but . . . blood purist.
- Sirius was cut off the family only after he left them, he is the one who burnt the bridges by running aways. And since he "only" been burnt and not dishinerited (like Andromeda), maybe he still had a chance to come back.
- Alphard was burnt the family tree by Walburga when she learnt he gave Galleons to Sirius to help him stay away from the family. It was more the tantrum of a mother rather than the concerted decision of the family.
- We don't know if Walburga portrait is an accurate representation of her. Some people speculated that the portrait was either "corrupted" by the house, or that Walburga kinda lost it in her old age.
- Nobody forced Regulus to join. He was fascinated by Voldemort (he clipped the articles talking about him in his room) and joined the Death Eaters himself. His parents must have been very proud, and Bellatrix probably helped him, but it was his mistake and his mistake alone. People seem to forget that Regulus was remorseless blood purist, he only "changed" side because Voldemort almost killed his House Elf.
- According to the Black Family tree, Cygnus Black got Bellatrix when he was . . . 13. It was probably Rowling who fucked up with numbers (never been that good with them), but yeah it's the canon age.
- I think Bellatrix was the most bigoted member of the Blacks, so I'm not sure she should be used as any kind of standard regarding them. After all, she considered Draco dying to complete his mission an honor while Narcissa was looking for a way to save him.

***** Thing is it's not just Sirius's point of view, though....the Black family is so notorious Dumbledore, McGongall, Moody, etc. aren't "surprised" that Sirius turned out "bad" (unfair, and they have their own slant, but the fact the family is so incredibly racist that multiple people are ready to write someone off for being a Black imo implies they must have been very, very bad),

Also, even if Reg was willing...if the timeline fits he would have only be 15/16. Any family that permitted that is just grossly negligent. Narcissa hates the idea of Draco joining in comparison. And the fact that the Potters were willing to take in Sirius is also a glaring red light that the Blacks were pretty awful instead of trying to reunite him with his family.

TLDR: It is from Sirius's POV, but there are hints and comments from other characters and certain elements which indicate they really were heinous.

That Seniors life was beginning to spiral no doubt didn't help him. Meanwhile, Regulus had died a Death Eater, Bellatrix was publicly known as a proud one, and the Blacks were known muggle haters.

*** This honestly makes sense to me. Even if he didn't /care/, it was pragmatic. Regulus was dead, and Walburga was too old to have any more kids, so Sirius getting out eventually was his best longshot chance of a heir to the Black bloodline surviving. Even if only to spite Malfoy.

** Well Sirius' mother blasted him off of the family tree. But Arcturus must not have approved. If he had then Sirius would not have inherited the Black fortune/House and it would have then gone to Draco. So Arcturus never took action to remove Sirius from the family.

Now we don't know what Arcturus tried. But considering when Sirius first went in Azkaban you had Dumbledore (who believed he was guilty and knew he didn't have a trial), Crouch (same, plus wanted to look tough after his son), and Bagnold (same, and probably accepted bribes to keep deatheaters out of Azkaban and most likely Sirius in).

So even if Arcturus tried to get him out the 3 who could "open" a "closed" case didn't see the need or have the desire to. Then with Fudge elected and in Malfoy's pocket (who would benefit greatly from Sirius being in Azkaban) the odds of Arcturus succeeding were slim to none.

Canon never addressed this but several fics have (most on variations of the above).

**** Sorry i was thinking next of kin (closest relative) for male inheritance which would be Draco. If inheritance is based on next of kin (closest relative) male or female it would be Bellatrix.

Of course, if lnheritance was based on blood/position of family then since the Sirius (1877) line is dead it would go to his brothers line (Arcturus 1884) and his daughter Callidora who married a Longbottom.

That's one part of the world that I don't think JKR fleshed out very well but it definitely gives fanfic authors lots of flexibility for stories.

** It didn't serve the plot? Honestly, canon has a lot of loose strings/plot holes that most people either skip over or fix using their headcanon.

I feel like Arcturus would have tried since Sirius was his only remaining descendant, and the only young male to carry the Black name. However, the evidence plus the Black family openly backing Voldie meant no one would accept testimony from any of Sirius's relatives, not even Andromeda.

As for Andromeda, you have to understand the true tragedy of a civil war. Distrust is everywhere - your neighbor who looked after your kids the year before is now selling information about them in return for the safety of their own family. Brothers backstabbing each other, a son spying on his own family. You would believe anything of anyone - it's why James and Sirius found it so easy to believe that Remus would betray them. It's likely also why Sirius seemed to forgive the members of the Orders - he accepted that he would have done the same in their shoes.
