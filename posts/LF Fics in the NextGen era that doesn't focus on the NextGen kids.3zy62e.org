Looking for fics that are set in the NextGen era but still focus on the original trio. I'm hoping for it to be canon compliant but it doesn't necessarily have to be epilogue compliant.

Bonus points for fics that don't focus on romance. I'd prefer a fic that has a substantial plot.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

ETA: I misread the title as seeking stories about NextGen, but not the trio's kids. Sorry.

  The Ministry of Magic is proud to say there hasn't been a Dark Lord in ten years, thank you very much. They wish Britain would remember this and not panic over dead magical creatures and vanishing people. Still, Senior Auror Ron Weasley doesn't give a damn what the public thinks. He just hopes all might someday be well. ---Auror mystery, Harry-Ron friendship, and canon ships.
