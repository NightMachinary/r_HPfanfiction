In light of recent events and things that have been said...

I have had the idea to rewrite Harry Potter, but to make it queer, have POC main characters, (ik a lot of people really like the idea of a black Hermione and I do too), and to try to right a lot of the wrongs that were made.

This also, however, seems like a big project and seems daunting to do alone. If anyone wants to help with this, please let me know. If you have any thoughts/ideas on it, please let me know.


** Well ive always pictured a black hermione would kinda be like hazel from the percy jackson series, while somewhat stereotypical it would be easy for both the writer and reader to comprehend and you as the writer would have an easier time writng her and finding things to relate cuz you would already have a template of sorts.

What do you mean by queer? as in strange or gay?

*** Ok, I want to avoid to try and avoid harmful stereotypes, I haven't read enough Percy Jackson to quite know who Hazel is yet... Queer as in there's going to be a few trans characters, a few people are gay, some are bi, gay, etc..
