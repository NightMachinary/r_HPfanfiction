Does anyone have any new Haphne fics, or just maybe some really good ones that are COMPLETED and preferably start the story before first year?

These things are preferable, but not completely necessary:

Non-entity Hermione, or at least an annoying character

Not Bashing Dumbledore

Not picking sides in the war, truly Grey!Harry

NOT HAVING RONALD WEASLEY AS A FRIEND

  Not Bashing Dumbledore

or

  Not picking sides in the war, truly Grey!Harry

  NOT HAVING RONALD WEASLEY AS A FRIEND
#+end_quote

These are not separable.

*** You can probably have Dumbledore that is overall good but made mistakes and is truly regretful though if you want good Dumbledore

*** They're preferable, but I'm okay with Having Dumbledore Bashed if it's unavoidable

  A slightly different purchase planning during his first visit to Diagon Alley means that Harry meets a completely different person than Draco Malfoy at Madam Malkin's. How will this encounter change the fate of the world? And will two restless souls together be able to find some happiness and love in a ruthless world? HP/DG
