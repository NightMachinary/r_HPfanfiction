I've been going through a lot of threads lately and I've noticed a theme. If someone doesn't like what OP requested they start complaining in the comments. Why? A request thread isn't a place for you to justify your hate for a character. It's for you to help OP by giving them stories that meet their request or something similar. If I request a fic starring a certain character, I'm asking people to help me find things that meet it. Not a whole speech about why I should hate said character. Excuse my ranting but I felt like it needed to be said.

** I totally agree with you. Personally, I particularly do not like fem Harry or mpreg stories, yet if I see a thread from someone requesting fem Harry or mpreg stories, I am not going to go there and berate the person that requested said stories, I will just move on to find a thread that actually does interest me. The same when someone requests something I am interested in, and when I join that thread they have added no slash. Well, I don't mind slash myself (among similar age characters - no HP/LV or HP/SS). Yet again, I am not going to berate the person making the request. I will peruse the thread to see if there are any reqs that look interesting that by some miracle, I have yet to read, and if I know of any fics that fit the request, I will add them. It is not my place to tell someone else what they should or should not like, just as it is not their place to tell me what I should or should not like.

**** I'm asking because I want to watch out for the pairings receiving backlash and push back against what the OP is talking about. It appears you are looking for negativity and have decided that is what I'm doing so I'm not sure what else to tell you.

Feel free to think the worst of me though.

****** That and stories that make Death Eaters/villainous characters more sympathetic or completely turn them into heroes seems to be disliked. Like Draco focused stories about redeeming his character, or Snape, or Tom Riddle seem to be disliked in comparison to Harry stories that completely change his character, even ones that turn his character evil.

** Thank you!

I posted a request a week or two ago (for Snily fics), and got /down-voted/ for it. Like, /why?/ If you don't have recs, or you're just frustrated with my question, then just move on with your day.

*** I'm fairly certain there are a couple bots that automatically downvote all new request threads. Either that or some sad people that do it on their own. Generally they bounce back, but not always.

**** That is strange! I'm reminded that I saw a post on another subreddit in which the mods had to formally ask people to stop reporting celebratory / happy posts.

But not gonna lie: it soothes my sensitive soul to think that maybe it was just a bot that down-voted my polite request. ðŸ˜…

***** There are bots that do that. I had a random very neutral comment be down voted and I kind of scratched my head and then my husband said there are bots thats purpose is just down voting. It seems like a strange thing for someone to start but...each there own?

*** Yeah, some people really like downvoting that kind of ship (DE/anyone). I try to upvote all request threads with controversial ships. I don't even like Tomarry for example, but will upvote it anyway to counteract the downvoting. Otherwise people will just be driven away from the sub, which if left unchecked turns a sub into an echo chamber.

*** Yeah, but they were probably trying to show people this issue about downvoting a request thread and show people how dumb their reaction to a /request,/ not a discussion how how much you hate this or that, about certain fics and characters just because they don't like it. It was a rhetorical question to get people to think that doing this is stupid in the first place.
