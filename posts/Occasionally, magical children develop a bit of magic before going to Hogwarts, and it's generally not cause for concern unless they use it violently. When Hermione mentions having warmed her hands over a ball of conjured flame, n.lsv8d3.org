Here's some ways this could come up in the story, though not all of them could happen in the same timeline:

- Hermione goes to Professor McGonagall during first year, after learning that the Dark Arts are fueled by negative emotion, and expresses concern that her fire might be Dark. McGonagall says the polite, kid-friendly version of "You're being a hypochondriac. Fuck off so I can do paperwork."
- When Charms class is studying flame spells, she stays after class and complains to Professor Flitwick that all the flame spells they're studying are boring/bland/have no teeth because they don't seem to want anything, or because they don't wiggle to try to get away from you, or because they don't have personality

  - Option 1: Flitwick is confused about why such a normally eager student is complaining, but he's busy grading things and says something dismissive, and she leaves.
  - Option 2: Flitwick is less busy, and asks what flame spells Hermione finds more interesting. She doesn't know the name, but offers to show him. Her hair stands up, and her eyes glow red like the fires of Hell (because no one can channel that much Dark magic without a bit leaking out), and a Fiendfyre mouse appears above the palm of her hand. Flitwick freaks out, as most people would in such a situation.

- At the battle of the Ministry, Voldemort summons Fiendfyre, and Hermione recognizes it. She starts talking to it (maybe she's named it something cute and red/orange-inspired like "Valentine" or "Sweetpea" or "Pumpkin") and effortlessly yoinks it away from him, and then begins terrorizing Death Eaters with it. Maybe Dolohov is too busy running for his life to hit her with that evil purple curse.

  - "Pumpkin! What are you doing here? It's good to see you again!" [She holds out her arms, like inviting a person to hug her; the Fyre abandons Voldie, and swirls around her without getting close enough to cause injury] "What do you say we have some fun with these Death Eaters?"
  - Later, when people question her about why she has better control of EVIL CURSED FIRE than Voldemort, who is famous for his excellent control of it, she admits that she's been playing with it since age 4, when she got mad about how cold her hands were getting and figured out how to turn anger into something warm

- During second year, after Harry reveals his Parseltongue, Hermione sees how much much British wizards freak out over anything that even looks like Dark magic. She resolves never to tell anyone but her closest friends about her skill with Fiendfyre. During the Horcrux Hunt, in seventh year, she offers to destroy the Locket, but only after extracting a promise from Harry and Ron not to hate her for the method.

******* My headcanon is that the wizarding world is so devoid of logic and rationality because logic inhibits magical creativity.

You have a magic system that basically works by a combination of: 1) knowledge, 2) creativity, 3) willpower. If you can *imagine* it, want it enough, and know it is possible, magic can do it.

So, maths and science and rules and logic can inhibit the creativity aspect to doing magic, and if you run into a wall in your knowledge, like say trying to transfigure an object into a pig, your knowledge of biology probably just makes it harder because you have to imagine all the details you know, you can't just un-know the parts of a pig. Conversely, your knowledge of biology may allow you to make a /more convincing pig/, but it will be more difficult to pull off altogether.

Now, there are exceptions to this, of course, but the person of average intelligence will be hitting walls of knowledge they simply can't bypass through study alone, resulting in common and creative applications of spells being much harder to perform. Better to be ignorant and a decent sorcerer rather than knowledgeable but shitty at magic.

**** That is very true! But I think a lot of HP rests on poor world building. Like why are all the spells Latin based? Surely there are wizards who use other languages, do they all use wands? I like to think that this would work bc British wizards are so reliant on their system, that when a kid learns some magic outside of it... it's just inconceivable to them. Also what if it's the start of heredity skills, like the Blacks being metamorphagous (spelling who knows?!) or the Gaunts being parseltounges ... This new kid is super good at imbuing runes with power, which he learnt from doodling on notebooks.

***** Rowling's worldbuilding is what it is. That's not a reason to make it even worse by introducing this idea of developing unearned superpowers through ignorance. In a sense, it goes against the setting's whole ethos: when wands are involved, knowledge is, literally, power.

Hereditary skills are fine, but they are very rare and aren't actually that powerful, compared to conventional talent and hard work. Neither metamorphmagus nor parselmouth talents are game-changers the way Dumbledore- or Riddle-grade intellect and motivation are.

Or the Black wind, a curse that creates a black haze that travels from person to person, but on contact starts causing cellular death, rotting flesh, and plague.
