Looking for fanfics where Harry raises his baby sister or his daughter, maybe his parents abandoned him and his sister, or he got some girl pregnant.

  The summer after his godfather's death was the worst in Harry's life for many reasons. An event so horrifying takes place causing him to question if he should even go on, but in the end all it takes is Faith to pull through and find the good in the dark.This story is based on ‘The Unknown Light' by Someryn and the idea was used with her permission. This is about rape and the aftermath so do not read if the subject matter offends or upsets you. There is no slash and Ginny is not raped.

#+begin_quote
  Harry is in his sixth year at Hogwarts and Ginny her fifth. The Second Wizarding War is nearly upon them and things are tough enough between school and saving the world, but things only get more difficult when the couple finds out that Ginny is pregnant.

  Harry comes home after finishing his fifth year, the happenings at the department of mysteries and Sirius death heavy on his mind. He finds the Dursley household in chaos and learns that sometimes great gifts come in small packages. As usual no slash!

*** Why...?

What?

This is the most confusing comment I have ever seen. And I once saw a comment chain singing the Little Einsteins tune on a post about crystals.

  What if a saner Voldemort, wary of a plot by Dumbledore, heard the prophecy and decided to assume a wait and see approach instead of leaping to action? Growing up as the son of two dedicated Order members who seem to care more about their war than their children, Harry becomes his sister's protector and nothing will ever stand between them. Not their parents' blind devotion to a vigilante with an overinflated sense of self importance and not a Dark Lord bent on slaughtering his way to complete dominance of Britain.  This is a Work In Progress. It is not finished. It may never be finished. Updates will be sporadic. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.
