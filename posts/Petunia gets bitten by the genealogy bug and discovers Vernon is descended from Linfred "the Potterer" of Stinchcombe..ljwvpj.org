(There is some support for this. The town of Dursley is just a mile or two from Stinchcombe in Gloucestershire. Some surnames do derive from an ancestor's point of origin. Discovered this little fact purely by accident and it combined nicely with an older prompt: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/klg405/vernon_got_on_very_well_with_his_sister_he_never/]] . I can't help but be amused at the notion that Vernon, of all people, has at least one wizard in his family tree.)
