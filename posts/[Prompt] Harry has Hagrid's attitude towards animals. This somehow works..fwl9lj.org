I've just got this wonderful mental image of Harry going through Hogwarts with enchanted expanded pockets with meat in, solving most of his problems by either showing off his amazing affinity for dealing with magical creatures or just throwing food at them because he thinks they are hungry.

â€‹

Sidenote: Dementors in this story would probably be something like demons or my own headcannon of what happens to humans if they have a horcrux and spend too long without being revived.


** When the trio run into fluffy the first time; Ron and Hermione would run away and he would stay there and start petting and playing with him. After they realize that Harry is not with them they would go back in to try to rescue him only to see him covered in drool.

Harry would walk up to the troll and calm him down with a lullaby and the Professors would walk in on an hysteric Hermione, a dumb founded Ron and Harry slowly petting the troll.

Harry would help Hagrid hide the dragon in the forest so that they could raise it together.

***** It would work even better if the Dursley family lived out in the countryside, and Harry would use the excuse of taking care of the animals to avoid his family. It meant that their horses always had gleaming shiny coats, and their enclosures were always spotlessly clean. Basically he developed a love for and empathy with any animals, and since vernon consistently won awards for his prized horses, he mostly left Harry to it.

Harry must clean when Dudley smuggles them in his room. The fishtanks are stored in the part of the barn Harry sleeps in, Dudley found the fishes boring.

** linkffn(8541055) has this to a degree. Apparently, Harry is a "Listener" here, which boils down to low-key animal empathy.

It's not the main plot or anything, and the story is dead. Still, it's something.

** In [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/swords-and-sorcery-fate-stay-night-harry-potter.399084/][Sword and Sorcery]], Fem!Harry (Named Iris) spends a lot of time with Hagrid. She is nervous about Fluffy and his other animals at first, but quickly grows used to them, eventually becoming as cavalier about them as Hagrid is, though a bit more conscientious about their power since she is a fragile human, while Hagrid is a half-giant.

One of the most hilarious scenes is when Hagrid returns after being accused in the second book, Iris calls to Fluffy who has been spending a lot of his time in the Forbidden Forest. The massive three headed dog comes bounding out of there, and it being a completely normal school day afternoon, it inspires a full on panic as every student but Iris and her friends flee for their lives.
