This is something I've never seen and would be very interested in reading. What if the Hat hadn't listened to Sirius, and sorted him into Slytherin with the rest of the Black family? Are there any fics that do that?


** In "Stages of Hope" he was sorted into Slytherin and is now its Head of House.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

  There are some things ungoverned by fate. If Sirius Black had gone the path of every Black before him, if he had been in Slytherin, he would have been a very different boy. It would have been a very different war.
