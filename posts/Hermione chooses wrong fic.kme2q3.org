I vaguely remember a fic like this where Harry confesses his love for hermione but she rejects him because he looks ugly, Harry has a makeover and looks AMAZING ðŸ˜‰ and hermione is jealous and angry. I would like emphasis on hermiones jealousy


** Interesting. Usually, in that trope, the genders are the reverse of what you describe.
