Odd request, I know.


** I too get frustrated with short Harry. Was reading a post-Hogwarts fic the other day and paragraph 2 said something like "he never reached his father's height". OotP literally says he's the same height as James. Serious "red X" moment.

******** Well there's too much stuff she didn't mention anyway. And again, bringing magic into the equation could do a lot of stuff. In terms of models I feel like it's just a few. Malfoys obviously but I'm not sure how related they are with the Blacks. Besides that who else is described with good looks? Maybe Mcclaggen. Chang but we don't know her blood status. There's Diggory.

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.

  [RE-WRITE PENDING] Magic is a strange and wondrous thing. It has no leaning or even understanding of good or evil. It merely is. Harry Potter fell off the grid half a decade before, after an explosion seared the earth of Privet Drive. No magic could find him. Their final hope led them to him, but what they found was...not quite what they expected. AU, Animagus, No Yaoi
