Just kinda stumbled on this while doing an unrelated search :

[[https://archive.org/details/savefanfiction?and[]=harry%20potter]]

Apparently they have 2,142 Harry Potter fanfictions archived there. I don't really a list of rare hard to find fanfictions that have disappeared off the internet so I have no idea if it's got anything good there. Might be useful to someone here i dunno.


** Some of those are archived pages from sites that required login to access; there's no way to get to the text in that case.

**** Not off the top of my head. I recall jumping on archive.org to try and find a story someone asked for and discovering that portkey.org pages required a login.

***** From what I can see at the URL I linked above pretty everything's in text file form. You click on a result and takes you to a preview page showing the text of the Fanfiction in Courier font with several download options down the right hand side.

***** You might of been on the Wayback Machine not on the Fanfiction Archive linked above. The Wayback machine retrieves previous historical versions of sites with all their HTML code intact. This Fanfiction Archive is basically just a collection of fanfictions extracted from various collections a few people have manually uploaded.
