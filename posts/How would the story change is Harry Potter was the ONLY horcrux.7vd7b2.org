** Heh, Philosopher's Stone could end a lot differently; hell-bent on killing the Boy-Who-Lived, Quirrelmort realises too late that Harry is the only thing tethering the Dark Lord to life, so that when Harry's near-death at the Mirror of Erised becomes an actual-death, he unwittingly takes Voldemort with him.

Really, though, the canon explanation for why a bit of soul got stuck in Harry's scar in the first place was because Voldemort's soul was already massively fractured from making horcruxes in the first place. Without them, he wouldn't last long enough for the soul bit to enter Harry's head after his killing curse is reflected back on him.

In order for this to work, Voldemort's initial immortality would have to come from someplace else...hrmm...

Alright, I have a couple of plot ideas for you:

1 - Voldemort's initial 'immortality' was actually a messed up ritual to turn him into a demon; by sacrificing 13 innocent souls, the last of which was intended to be Harry Potter, he aimed to become a mighty and terrible demon or half-demon. When the killing curse backfired on him, the 92% complete ritual activated to save him from death, transforming Voldemort into a meagre possessing spirit. This is basically a possibility for how Voldemort survived without horcruxes, not that conductive to a story where Harry's the only one...

2 - Voldemort died that night...but his spectre has come back as a revenant, hell-bent on taking Harry Potter down. In this case, Harry's anchoring Voldemort to life, but only in the sense that destroying him is the sole purpose for which Voldemort continues to exist. You could get a good story out of Harry fleeing Voldemort's spectre, seeking to find a way to erase the 'horcrux curse' that allows Voldemort to track him.

*** Plot #2 sounds really interesting. Protecting Harry would actually create increasing amounts of collateral damage because Voldemort would have to gain more power just to get to him.

If the circumstances became public knowledge I could totally see the entire wizarding world attempt to sacrifice Harry to appease the +gods+ demon.

**** This nails one of my problems about the whole horcrux plotdevice: It makes it seem as if the big problem about Voldemort is to kill him permanently. That's so lame. Voldemort should be difficult to defeat. He's the super-duper dark lord that everyone is afraid of. His defeat in 1981 was a total fluke and he even had a backup plan for that eventuality. Under normal circumstances noone is able to defeat him, whether he can be killed or not is completely inconsequential.

What I'm trying to say: Sacrificing Harry shouldn't resolve the biggest problem about Voldemort or guarantee his eventual defeat. The biggest problem about him should be his power and abilities, not some stupid McGuffin(s).

Killing Harry doesn't make Voldemort easier to overpower, it only makes it so he can't come back from the dead.

I know. But even in the books there are no questions asked about "what do we do after we destroyed the Horcruxes.". The whole thing is somehow treated as a means to an end. I would have never gone on that idiotic quest, because it seems much more prudent to get Voldemort into his wraith form, defeat all the Death Eaters and while remaining extra vigilant give yourself years to track down his Horcruxes - maybe even use some more resources than 3 school children and a hunch where to look.

"Oh noez... he can't be killed! You have to destroy his Horcruxes first!"

"So?! He can still be imprisoned, tortured for information or into insanity, temporarily killed, crippled, obliviated, experimented on or whatever dark and twisted thing I can come up with. I'm not going to turn my back on the guy aiming a gun at me in order to look for some stupid McGuffins without having a plan how to kill him first."

The whole logic in the story is backwards! It pretends that trying to kill/defeat Voldemort is pointless even though that's blatantly false. The last time that happened they got 10 years of peace and quiet. It *is* pointless to look for his Horcruxes if you can't defeat him yet though. "We should try to overthrow Voldemort's regime and for ways to defeat him and maybe if we're bored look for some Horcruxes along the way"

How the story actually could have gone: All was well. Except noone knew that Voldemort created another accidental horcrux in 1975 while murdering a bunch of younglings. Since everyone just accepted the Seven-Horcruxes theory just because teenage Voldemort talked about it once with a school Professor - without ever considering that he might have changed his mind - they all died horribly 5 years later, when Voldemort hit them with a surprise attack. There was no happily ever after for any of our heroes.

******* I actually came up with another idea, once, that the Horcruxes didn't make Voldemort literally immortal, rather, they let him 'defy death', in the sense of resisting cosmic order & fate.

Meet a powerful opponent? His strength will grow to match them. Hit by a notoriously deadly curse? He'll oh-so-dramatically stand back up. Caught in an inescapable trap? He'll stay for all of 15 minutes before pulling a brand new power out of his rear end to break free.

In other words, Horcruxes make the Mary Sue.

And thusly the reason it becomes so important to find and destroy all of them is because Voldemort is narratively-unbeatable otherwise, with the sole exception of whatever Lily did to slow him down for 15 or so years.

** I'd be interested in reading a story where Harry is the only Horcrux, and Dumbledore doesn't know about the blood protection, so he thinks Harry will actually die. Dumbledore only realizes this around Harry's 16-17 age range. So everyone loves Harry like in canon, including Dumbledore, but Dumbledore still needs him to die, which is an agonizing decision for him to make. Then all the Weasleys and Harry find out, and Harry accept it, but Ron, Ginny, Hermione, Remus etc don't. And the story becomes about this impossible decision and the characters coming to accept it/not accept it.

No, he wasn't.

Dumbledore absolutely knew Harry would survive and had been plotting for several years to ensure that it would happen. He knew he had outplayed Voldemort at the end of Goblet of Fire when Harry told him that his blood had been used in the resurrection ritual.

#+begin_quote
  “He said my blood would make him stronger than if he'd used someone else's,” Harry told Dumbledore. “He said the protection my --- my mother left in me --- he'd have it too. And he was right --- he could touch me without hurting himself, he touched my face.”

  For a fleeting instant, Harry thought he saw a gleam of something like triumph in Dumbledore's eyes.
#+end_quote

All of Dumbledore's machinations paid off. He had one last step - Snape needed to ensure Harry found out at the last possible moment, when the Horcruxes were all destroyed, that Harry was the last one.

And he told Snape, /very specifically/ that Harry needed to be aware that /Voldemort MUST/ be the one to do it.

#+begin_quote
  “So the boy . . . the boy must die?” asked Snape quite calmly.

  “And Voldemort himself must do it, Severus. That is essential.”

  “We have protected him because it has been essential to teach him, to raise him, to let him try his strength,” said Dumbledore, his eyes still tight shut. [...] If I know him, he will have arranged matters so that when he does set out to meet his death, it will truly mean the end of Voldemort.”
#+end_quote

You can argue that Dumbledore's plan was convoluted. You can argue that his plan was unlikely to work. But his choice was between Harry's permanent death by non-convoluted means or the possibility that he could maneuver things in a way that ensured Harry's survival.

For all the trouble going on in the world around them - Voldemort's resurrection, Moody's incapacitation and torture, to Cedric Diggory's death - Dumbledore's mask slipping to show his triumph when Harry discusses his blood being used in the ritual will always cement his love for Harry, in my mind. Defeating Voldemort would always be difficult, but the /absolute hardest/ road that Dumbledore could take - a road requiring his own death to ensure Snape could tell Harry what he needed to know at the right time, when Voldemort kept his snake close-by - was the one that he sought out. The road that would, should everything come to fruition, would allow the boy who he viewed as a grandchild to survive the war.

How?! What would have happened if Voldemort send a cutting curse towards Harry's neck (or a Bombarda on his head or anything that would have been more in character) instead of letting Narcissa check on his pulse?! Would Harry's head magically reattached itself to Harry?

Oh, and I thought Harry won because Voldemort wasn't the true owner of the Elder Wand. How did Dumbledore plan for that?

IMHO there's very little evidence that Dumbledore expected Harry to survive. Unless Dumbledore is omniscient or omnipotente there's plenty of opportunities for Harry to die that Dumbledore couldn't have planned for (and actually made more likely by leaving Harry in the dark about is plans).

There were, of course, things that could go wrong. Dumbledore was doing his absolute best, though. It was either his plan, or Harry died. Dumbledore could have said "Fuck you, Harry", killed him, and hunted for the horcruxes himself. Instead, he set in plan a motion that would have the best chance for Harry to be able to survive. He loved him.

As for keeping Harry in the dark - he /had to/. One of the key ingredients to Harry's survival was invoking similar properties to Lily's sacrifice. Harry couldn't know about his chances of survival for things to work - that's why he so specifically phrased things to Severus.

As for the Elder Wand... That wasn't part of Dumbledore's plan at all. His plan went awry. He admits this, openly.

#+begin_quote
  “Why did you have to make it so difficult?”

  Dumbledore's smile was tremulous.

  “I am afraid I counted on Miss Granger to slow you up, Harry. I was afraid that your hot head might dominate your good heart. I was scared that, if presented outright with the facts about those tempting objects, you might seize the Hallows as I did, at the wrong time, for the wrong reasons. If you laid hands on them, I wanted you to possess them safely. You are the true master of death, because the true master does not seek to run away from Death. He accepts that he must die, and understands that there are far, far worse things in the living world than dying.”

  [...]

  “If you planned your death with Snape, you meant him to end up with the Elder Wand, didn't you?”

  “I admit that was my intention,” said Dumbledore, “but it did not work as I intended, did it?”

  “No,” said Harry. “That bit didn't work out.”
#+end_quote

Far from being omnipotent, the last two books showcase Dumbledore's imperfections. He wasn't all-knowing and, given the reason for his poor health in Half-Blood Prince, had weaknesses and faults that led to his demise.

But he did his best. He cared about Harry. And, even once his carefully laid plans for the Elder Wand were destroyed by Draco, he still offered the child refuge from Voldemort, with his last moments.

It is ironic to me that the people who so ardently despise or think poorly of Dumbledore are the ones who so typically hold onto the belief that he was omniscient, that everything that went poorly must so obviously be his fault, as if he is a master puppeteer.

The truth is that Dumbledore was an extremely intelligent, but flawed man who cared very deeply about every person and being around him.

******** I think he would have figured it out eventually. There were plenty of clues that hinted a deeper connection between Harry and Voldemort. Maybe Voldemort would have already risen, meaning he would have Harry sacrifice himself. I admit I overestimated Dumbledore's omnipotence, but I still think the series would have concluded earlier and definately without Dumbledore's death, if only from a logical standpoint. If you're thinking of this concept from a story-telling veiw then I think the plot would be different.
