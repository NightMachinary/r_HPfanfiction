So everyone knows about the fight Ron and Harry have in book seven because of the locket right? I was wondering if there were any fics were Harry himself causes those kinds of negative emotions since he is also a horcrux. Like a really isolated Harry who doesn't have friends because everyone around him is inexplicably angry or sad or any other negative emotion when they get to close to him. This could also be used as the reason the Dursley's were so horrible to Harry. I just thought of this and I really want to see if anyone has written anything like it.

** The Horcrux had to be put on. Ginny would have been angry during sex if she had done it before the Horcrux was destroyed.
