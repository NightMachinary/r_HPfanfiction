So I'm rereading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10339852/1/][The Many Harry Potters of Little Hangleton]] (highly amusing; thoroughly recommended), and it's left me craving a fic where using Other!Harry's blood (werewolf, vampire, multi-animagus, goth, emo, My Immortal-inspired, zombie, hippie, alcoholic... whatever) in the resurrection ritual has a notable effect on Voldemort.

Crack or serious, any length, any pairings. My only requisite is that the changed Voldemort is a significant part of the plot.


** I am currently writing a fic where the "Other" part of Harry causes Voldemort problems in fifth year, because the ritual did not take into account something that requires very specific circumstances to not reduce the person to a puddle of green goop. (Hint, it's a Danny Phantom crossover) That is all I will say about it for now.

** Isn't there a story where when Wormtail is doing the ritual and gets to the "and the blood of the enemy, forcibly taken" Harry says something along the lines of, "no, go ahead take it" right before Wormtail cuts him and it weakens Voldemort since it was willing?
