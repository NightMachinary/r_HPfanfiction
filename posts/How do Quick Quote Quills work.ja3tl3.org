Are they enchanted items that read the thoughts of their owner and their interpretation of what one said? Are they mischievous items that are deliberately designed to twist the sentences they hear in an unpleasant way? Are they quasi-sentient items that can understand the both the owner and the speaker so that they interpret the message based on the relationship between the owner and the speaker? What are your thoughts?

  “Testing . . . my name is Rita Skeeter, Daily Prophet reporter.” Harry looked down quickly at the quill. The moment Rita Skeeter had spoken, the green quill had started to scribble, skidding across the parchment: Attractive blonde Rita Skeeter, forty-three, whose savage quill has punctured many inflated reputations --- “Lovely,” said Rita Skeeter, yet again, and she ripped the top piece of parchment off, crumpled it up, and stuffed it into her

  He had a funny feeling Rita Skeeter's Quick-Quotes Quill might just explode with excitement if he did.

Probably a combination of your second and third ideas. It's clear that many enchanted objects usually have a degree of sentiency in HP. I'd say that this one does. It's clear the quill remembers its previous work for Skeeter or at the very least has knowledge of her. It's twisting the narrative to support Skeeter's agenda but also itself. It hints towards itself with "savage quill". But it's also an enchanted object made for use. It's deliberately designed to help its owner quickly come up with memorable quotes.

*** More than that, your quote shows that the quill specifically twists whatever it's quoting as harshly as possible while still remaining technically true. I think the "savage quill" bit is supposed to be about Rita, not itself. The quill goes out of it's way to paint an unflattering, sensational picture out of whatever quotes it's fed.

** Maybe they are like wands and "chose" their owners acordingly to their personality traits. Skeeters one was waiting for a long time before finding someone perverse enough to own it. They grow alongside their owner, the better the match the best for both parties.
