Many people (me included) don't bother with any stories below a certain amount of words (on fanfiction.net usually anything below 100k words): shorter stories often simply have a hard time setting up an interesting unique storyline and/or character-development and resolving the whole thing without feeling rushed.

The 'problem' is that some authors split their stories into multiple 'books' (e.g. one book for every year at hogwarts). While this splitting is a good thing once you have foubd the story, it is problematic while searching for long stories. I might never see part 1 of a trilogy if the first part is only 50k words long, and will probably ignore the story if it says 'part 2' in the description, if I haven't stumbled over the first part before that.

That's why I'd like to see some recommendations for some long stories here which I'd miss that way.


** Hmm, maybe linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff) and the sequels? The first one has 29k words, so it just barely misses the 30k+ cut-off.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

** Stargon1's series, beginning with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10449375/1/The-Cupboard-Under-the-Stairs][The Cupboard Under the Stairs]]. It's in progress, but currently over 300k, split over four stories, from first year to currently fourth year. I love this series!
