I want a story where teachers, and students alike are actually questioned about their stupidity. I mean lack of common sense is one thing, but this is ridicioulous.

For example who thought it was a good idea to send three beginner wizards, and a half-giant who isn't that good at magic into the forbidden forest that is forbidden for a reason. How about the stupid idea of keeping a Cerberus, and a troll for a trap for the most dangerous wizard in decades-centuries in a f****** school. How about dismissing everyone back to their houses from the great hall during a 'sighting' of a troll in the dungeons where half the bloody students sleep.

And this is just year one not to mention small things like their MOVING stairs or a reward for breaking rules, and putting yourself in extreme danger to catch a remberall.


** You've clearly not been reading HP fanfiction for very long. Or if you have, you've clearly been looking in the wrong place (somehow). Because these fics are /everywhere/.

Just sift through the bashing fics communities. You'll find all you want eventually, especially if you go for Dumbledore bashing and Light bashing. Or go for the Indy!Harry fics. Lord Potter-Black-Slytherin-Gryffindor-Peverell fics. Those really progressive Muggle fics that bash everything and anything about the Wizarding World and insist that the Muggle World is 5234897482781 times better. You'll probably find one of these the Wizarding-World-is-dumb-af rants in every five fics. Unfortunately, that's all I can point you towards. I usually make it a point to avoid these rants because they really do annoy me, and if they do appear, I skim. There's probably a few on my favourites list, but I don't remember which ones have this trope, as they tend to blur together after a while.

*** Yes. I know there are a lot of bash fics out there, but they are usually unrealistic. The first thing I want is deserved bashing. A lot of the stories that bash out there do it on perceived slights, and problems, but I want basically a bash/common sense fic that doesn't have to make crap up since there is no reason for it like for example the Mcgonnagal setting a detention for kids in the forbidden forest scene should be bashed. I mean in what world is it right to send kids into an incredibly dangerous forest, but Harry at the Dursleys isn't really a reason to bash. Dumbledore truly couldn't understand a family being cruel to each other. While he made a mistake there it was an honest mistake that people with common sense would make, but once again the forbidden forest scene had a distinct lack of common sense in it.

**** A reasonable bashing fic is a bit of a tall order. Although your comment on the Forbidden Forest did remind me of one fic that might actually meet your requirements! McGonagall explains it away as a mix up, and that it was supposed to be 7th years in the Forbidden Forest, but she still gets shit for the negligence. Linkffn(12324284)

I'm not sure if this fic fits what you want though. Like I said, the trope wears on my a little, so I didn't finish reading this. Either way, I'm pretty sure in terms of reasonable bashing fics, this is all I've got.

*** I hate those fics that say everyone in the wizarding world is stupid af. Did it ever occur to the authors that wizards have a different view of what danger is and how it should be treated. I have no doubt that there are tribes that once had their youths fight lions with a spear as a coming of age ceremony. Are we going to go down there and tell them that they are stupid? The wizarding world has a lot of danger. If have no doubt that just about every adult wizard is capable of recognising a dangerous situation. Perhaps going into the forbidden forest with the games keeper is simply not considered dangerous.

Even if the cerebrus isn't bugging anyone a school teacher telling the kids not to go somewhere will encourage them to go there. It's in the nature of kids to be curious, and not care for the consequences.

Now if he conjured a wall in front of said door or tranfigured the door into a wall, and reguraly redid it so it doesn't fade(while obviously undoing, and redoing it to feed said cerebrus), and didn't tell the kids not to go there(therefore they won't feel that urge that all kids feel to explore a dangerous area while feeling like they are in a safe environment hence why they go there in the first place(child psycology 101)), and have the house elves moniter the area reguraly, only after all that could I consider having the cerebrus there in any way 'safe'.

************************ And how does that stop the grangers from finding a therapist for their daughter. Also the wizarding world does have healers so it's not much of a stretch that they have a wizard/witch equivelant of a therapist. Also their still human, just because they can do magic doesn't change that. If anything it's their own fault for not trying to to help them. Dumbledore at the least has a duty of care to his students, and has spent some time in the muggle world, and is pro muggles so he should at least have basic knowledge of a therapist. Also why wouldn't they need therapy. Give me one good reason apart from 'their wizards'. Just because their wizards doesn't change the fact that harry, and hermione at the least had a muggle up bringing so they have a muggle mind set, and with such a mind set will require some therapy.

I could see the argument that Ron with a witches up bringing could be more desensetized to such things except, oh yeah his crippling fear of spiders, and just surviving an attack from literally hundreds of at least human sized, and larger spiders. Even ron after that will require therapy.

Lastly even if they don't have therapists doesn't mean they don't need them. Going by your analogy if you broke your leg in a crazy jungle surrounded by a nomadic tribe who don't have a doctor so they usually cut things like broken arms, and legs off means you should get it cut off. Doesn't matter if a doctor is only a few kilometres away you don't know such a thing exists.

Do you now see the stupidity in such actions. Just because they don't know they need it doesn't mean they don't need it.

Also it's not like their in the middle of a jungle/desert/area far from civilisation, the muggle world is leterally right next to the largest shopping area in britain, ministry of magic accessed by a telephone booth. They have knowledge of the muggle world it's their fault if they don't try to take advantage of that. It wouldn't be difficult. Ten minute walk to a library, and some studying, and they have a greater understanding of the muggle world, and how it can help them.

** I think these are the primary reasons for so many bash fics:

- JKR described the magical world as a horrible dystopia, once readers got past the 'fantastic' facade of the magic.
- Children's literature generally dumbed down adults. In HP's case it was mostly Dumbledore who got handed the idiot ball, so he got the most bashing as a result.
- Then shippers piled in and bashed those who blocked their favorite ships. This effort was led by Movie screenwriter Steve Kloves, who was an Emma fan and tried his best to push for a Harmony solution. I see the plethora of Ron/Ginny bash fics heavily influenced by Kloves' very biased writing.
- Finally, the stake of the war against Voldemort was extremely high. Voldemort winning and consolidating his power in Magical Britain would lead to deaths of thousands or even millions. They were fighting against a monstrous enemy who was a combination of medieval barbarism/sadism and Nazi nihilism (or in other words, an enemy far worse than Nazis and ISIS), and yet JKR wouldn't even let them use lethal force during the Final Battle. For example, the Trio already knocked out Greyback after he mutilated Lavender. Why didn't they follow up with a lethal strike to put that sadistic serial killer permanently out of business? We saw Greyback getting back up later, ready to torture, mutilate, and murder again. Many readers, including me, don't like that attitude AT ALL.

So to sum up, there was a dangerous unknown in the Forbidden Forest killing unicorns with a grounds keeper who was bad at magic who thinks it's a good idea to stick rival students together, and then split up.

Muggle wisdom or not that is pure stupidity. Also the wizarding world is a government that has close relations with it's muggle counterpart, and has a regular influx of muggleborns/halfbloods so apart from the whole electricity thing they seem to mostly follow a muggle based system with magic. They have a court of law. They have a form of schooling that you must attend. A 'policing' force. A parliment. Also I don't see anything dangerous happening to other kids with the adult/parent in charge not caring.
