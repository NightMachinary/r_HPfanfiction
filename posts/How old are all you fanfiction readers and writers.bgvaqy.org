Okay. So I'm 15 and I know absolutely no one except my twin who reads fanfiction and anyone that knows I read it either mocks it or me..... I have also noticed that in other discussions on this subreddit most people seem to be older,this is also noticible in comments sections of most fics I've read. Opinions?


** I'm now 26 but started reading and writing fanfic at 12/13. Teenagers suck and there's a lot of judgemental attitudes towards fanfic, but when I got older I found out that way more people than I realised had read fanfic at that age too, it's just no one shouted about it.

*** Same here! I'm 26 and started reading in middle school so 12/13 and I started my fanfic journey with Harry Potter fics. Yeah a lot of people read fanfics and I'm a teacher now so I do catch my students read/write fanfics “in secret” during class sometimes as well.

*** Very similar here. Its interesting to be someone who's stayed with the fandom so long as it feels like most (or most of the people who comment or talk online) people are either younger or have come to the fanfic community later, maybe even largely through the movies or at least heavily influenced by them.

** 21, But I got into fanfiction at 12-13 because I always was interested in the "What if this happened?" sense of things. I opened an account when I was 14 and I still have it. Unfortunately, my first stories had tons of spelling, grammar, etc mistakes that have no good reason being there. I wish I invested in a beta lol. I also wish I planned out my stories better so that I wouldn't have so many abandoned ones haha.

I know much better now.

** I started at 12, now I'm in my twenties.

Ignore them. I was really self-conscious about it for a while, because it was such a geeky thing to do, etc, etc. As always, none of my real friends cared. Was there some gentle teasing? Yes. Was it malicious? No. Were there people who would have been malicious if I'd talked about it? Probably, but I didn't ask for their opinion anyway.

When you get to college, or get a job, or whatever you decide to do, you'll find that you aren't the only person, far from it. There's more people in the real world, and far fewer who have the time and inclination to get so worked up about what someone else is doing with their life.

I've had people come up to me and start conversations with me about fanfiction because they've seen me reading in class (sorry not sorry). One of my high school friends who used to tease me reads it now and asks for recommendations.

TLDR; read what you want, and don't worry what others think. You're under no obligation to tell them anything about your life if you don't want to.

** Well, now i am 17 so not such a big age gap, but when i started i was 13 or less so it depends. Now, any fandom has a specific age range. I mean, you can read HP fanfiction until you reach the fifties but most readers are the few loyals that have caught the very release of the books and are still inyerested and up to the youngest.

** I'm 18 and I know one other person who has read fanfictions previously. Most people dislike them and I get why. Most readers/writers come off as rather young, but this subreddit is the exact opposite. A lot of people here I feel are very much so older than the usual demographic of fanfic enthusiasts. There is a reason the stereotyp of the 14 y/o girl reading smut exists.

** Now 23. Read the first ff (HPMoR) about 5 years ago. I yet have to dip my finger into writing one though... Honestly, you cant make others lifes worst by reading fanfics, so you should definitly keep doing what you want to do. Usually people dont get why the others do things, and since we are humans, we ridicule each other. In my opinion reading fanfics is the same as reading a book from famous/not so famous authors. Only I know that whoever wrote the story has something common with me: undieing love to a fandom. So I see two approach: either show them what they miss, or leave them alone and let them have their own fun.

​

I actually spent 5 months last year entirely rewriting something I first attempted at 15, and that was really amazing --- seeing this story idea develop and shift from its initially terrible execution into something both my fifteen-year-old self and I can now be proud of.

** I went through much the same thing when I was 15, I'm now 32. I started reading fanfiction in 1998 (when I was 12) and used to have a binder with my favourites printed out that even came to school with me. My nerd game was strong. It didn't do me any favours when it came to being popular and I did get mocked for it, but it was something I loved. I'm just old enough to remember old printed zines where you had fanfiction published, so it's been around a long time for me and evolved from that to geocities to ffnet to ao3.

​

I started writing at 14, and back then, it felt like everyone was older than me. When I started writing at 14, it felt like a good creative writing outlet. When we were asked to try an unusual format for English class, I wrote fanfiction and I ended up having a discussion with the teacher about it (who was fascinated by the concept), Fanfiction, even then, held more appeal than a lot of the books in the school in the school library because I either knew the characters or I could relate to the writing. It was also a much more queer friendly space than a late nineties British senior school library was. I remember reading somewhere about how fanfiction is transformative, if gives you a chance to explore identity and experiences and what you think about things and as a young writer, I definitely found that helped me find what I liked to write and read. Even as I went on to read a wider variety of published works as I got older, I still loved fanfiction for it's freedom, creativity and for a community that helped me learn how to write in the way I wanted to. It was inspiring, it was fun and it was free. The older authors were by and large encouraging to younger writers and often helped on fanfiction boards like mugglenets old one or force,net when I was stuck. Despite some of the nastier feedback or trolls or offline mockery, fanfiction has been a huge part of my life for twenty years. Though I will take writing breaks for years at a time, will go a little while where I inhale it daily or I won't read or write in a specific fandom for a decade, I don't see it stopping any time soon. There's too much to read, write, meta about and get inspired by.

​

I will add to this by saying that some of my friends have gone on to be teachers or work with teenagers, which has meant they've had to go back and either scrub their fanfiction from when they were fifteen under their real name or make sure it's under a pen name as no one wants to know their teacher wrote a lot of unrealistic lemons (sexually explicit fanfiction) in their teens. They also have to make sure anything they post now is from nothing that will link to their offline email, real name, etc. While this seems fairly standard these days, back in the day, a lot of people just used their real name. Due to this use of pen names, you never really know who is a fic writer and who isn't. It can surprise you. I ended up finding out that one of my neighbours was a fic writer whose fics I'd read only a few years ago. It's more widespread than you think, though I'll admit, I saw most people do it in college rather than high school.

​

The tl;dr of this is a lot of us were you once. Stick with it if you enjoy it, it can be rewarding and fun even if there is a stigma. Fanfiction writers are like spies - you never know who is one in secret.

** I'm 61, got into fandom at 48, and have no shame about it, although I'm circumspect about sharing my hobby with nonfandom people. I've written (unpublished) original fiction all my life, but I was going through writer's block when I first stumbled across HP fandom online. It added pleasure and friendship to a life that was quite miserable for several years, plus it gave me an outlet to write when I might not have had it otherwise.

The fabulous thing about fandom is the community of shared interests, although no one would deny it has its batshit elements. But fanfiction allowed me to write for fun again, relax my critical standards, and get feedback that wasn't all about improvement and professional standards. Audience response is always a gift (not counting flames, of course), but it's very, very different when it's given with emotion and genuine excitement than in a classroom or workshop context.

So enjoy your hobby, OP. There's nothing wrong with it, and it can be as much or as little a part of your life as you want it to be. You can go away and come back. You can participate or lurk. It's entirely up to you.

** I'm 24.

I started reading fanfics around Summer 2017 (I read HPMoR during 2014ish, but it didn't give me any interest in HP fanfic in general) after reading Backwards with Purpose, reading basically anything since I didn't really have a standard yet and everything was new and fancy, I was 23 back then. At the time I mostly read Harry-centric fanfics, set in Hogwarts during the 90s.

In late April 2018, I read 2 different SS-centric fics, one set in the Marauder-era (They Didn't Know We Were Seeds), the other during his entire life (The Snape Chronicles). They permanently changed my preferences -- both in terms of what characters I prefer reading about (SS-centric), and changed my views on pairings to almost what they are now. Some time later, I read a Tonks-centric fic set in HP's 5th year that also added HPNT as one of my favorite pairings -- but it's not a common ship so finding good fics of that kind is a bit tricky. My preferences hasn't changed since.

thankfully, my mother's a linguist, and dealing with her throughout my life probably has affected my writing style for the better, even if it makes me snobby about the writing style of things I read.

I knew a few people growing up who read fanfics but not many. It's still fairly small these days, but I'm friends with fellow writers now--it's pretty nice. I've nevee written a HP fic though, only read.

** I'm 18 and started writing fanfictions when I was 13 or 14. My last one, /The Lost Child/, was my first actual story hasn't been updated in a long time. I've noticed that because of the ages I wrote it at and how many changes I went through mentally and emotionally it's very inconsistent and parts of it are poorly written. My plan is to rework the whole thing as I'm not a lot more mature and a lot more experienced as a writer. Hopefully I'll have the majority of it improved and at a much higher quality of storytelling by Autumn this year.

If anyone's curious about this story, I'll link it here: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10789135/1/The-Lost-Child]]

** I'm 17. I've been reading fan fiction since like 2008. I think the fact that it's mostly older people in this sub is a guarantee, due to adults and people who have been consuming fan fiction for a long time have been weeding out the fan fiction they think are god awful from their ride or die fics (side note- it's so interesting that there can be many different opinions on the same fic. For example HPMOR. I read the first three chapters and liked it, but then my opinion of the book took a nosedive from the jarring character displays, reiterations of the same three chapters, and just dumbassery of Harry even though he's supposed to be this holier than thou genius; while others think that it's the best thing since sliced bread and will cut you if you say one bad thing about it. Absolute snobs). I've noticed a commonality between multiple genres/types of fanfics people are looking for. We've been reading fan fiction for so goddamn long that we want to read the best of the best, and that's mostly through word of mouth recommendation (experience). So while you can know a lot of fanfics, to really get to the nitty gritty of it, it's mostly older people who have the best recommendations because they're the most knowledgeable on the subject and they know their way around certain subgenres and their opinions change over time.

** I'm 66. Got started on Ranma fanfiction well over a decade ago (I don't remember exactly when), and got into Harry Potter by reading crossovers. I've written two crack HP one-shots, but they've only been put on a Yahoo! Groups mailing list.

I look on reading fanfiction as an outgrowth of my long-term (since age 7) interest in science fiction & fantasy. Fanfiction, like everything else, generally follows Sturgeon's Law (90% of everything is crap). Finding one of the good ones, though ...

Some of my friends and family know I read it, and some don't. Not a big deal either way; long before I read fanfiction, I used to get "you read that kiddie rocket ship stuff?" comments sometimes.
