** What happened in the Tri-Wizard Tournament wasn't a "betrayal". Two fourteen-year-old, pre-pubescent boys got in a hissy fit, and then didn't talk for like 14 days. Calling that tiff a "betrayal" minimizes every real betrayal that's ever happened, fictional and non-fictional.

The thing is, Ron didn't know that. I guarantee that if Ron had actually known that, he would have stuck with Harry like glue. Literally six months earlier, Ron on a broken and mangled leg stood in front of - who he believed to be - a mass murderer and said, "If you want to get Harry, you're going to have to go through me."

In fact, as soon as Ron realizes that tournament is quite dangerous, he apologizes immediately:

#+begin_quote
  > "Harry," he said very seriously, "whoever put your name in that goblet, I - I reckon they're trying to do you in"
#+end_quote

And, if you still feel like Ron "betrayed" Harry, take it from the character who actually got "betrayed":

#+begin_quote

****** Yeah but there's a difference between knowing something and /knowing/ something.

I remember my freshman year of college, my parents told me internships during the summer were important, and that those internships were filled by February. They told me this multiple times. Supposedly I "knew" this. But I sat on my ass, and lo and behold, I didn't have an internship after freshman year. It was then, when all my friends were making money and I wasn't, and all my friends were getting work experiences that I realized, holy shit internships are important.

Ron knew maybe on some abstract level this tournament was dangerous. But he probably thought it was dangerous like Quidditch is dangerous. Sure you get hurt, but nothing /really/ happens.

I love Ron, because out of all the characters in the book, he's human and relatable. He gets angry and jealous, he's insecure, and he hates schoolwork (who doesn't).

He's also brave, has a good heart, and cares deeply for his friends and family. Ron's like Samwise Gamgee. He wasn't chosen, he's not the brightest wizard of his generation, but he walks into hell just so his best friend doesn't have to do it alone.

******* That is not even a comparison. This wasn't a goal Ron had to work to understand, it was simple information. By Hermione's own words it was his jealousy preventing him from acknowledging it, not his lack of really knowing it. Hermione said people died, not that they simply got hurt. I didn't say Ron was bad, my point was that it's demonstrably false that he didn't know the tournament was life threatening. Yes, it became real for him but it was not, as people had been pretending, just some lack of knowing Harry's life was in danger again. It was jealousy that came about it a way that did't really make sense. And to be fair, that is realistic. But equally realistic is to be rightfully criticized for acting as Ron did without it being excused.

**** Here's how it went down from Ron's perspective.

There's this really cool competition going on at your school. It's kind of dangerous, so only the older kids can participate, but it's still a school thing with 17-year-old contestants. It's got an amazing prize, plus bragging rights forever. You're 14 years old. You really can't conceive that anyone wouldn't want to enter. You damn sure want to enter.

And then your best friend somehow loopholes himself into the tournament and won't tell you how. You've gone through some stuff together, so this stings a bit. Of course you don't believe that he didn't enter himself. First, Harry can be a sneaky little shit, and second, what sort of nefarious plot involves a school sponsored event? So, you get mad that he won't tell you, his best friend, and he gets mad that you don't believe him, so you don't talk to each other for a couple weeks.

Then the first task happens and you get smacked in the face with the idea that this school tournament is actually for-real dangerous and not school-liability-issues dangerous, and you apologize immediately when you realize you were wrong. Which, for a 14-year-old boy is nearly saint-like in its humility. Thus comes to an end the Great Betrayal.

***** Disclaimer: I'm not agreeing with the idea that this was a betrayal on Ron's part. I understand Ron's perspective.

However, I'd personally be less hurt by the fact that he "didn't care" that I was in a life-or-death situation - because obviously he would and does care that Harry's in a life-or-death situation - than the fact that despite the fact that I have no reason to lie to him, he still thinks that I am. After three years of friendship, during which they'd broken a million school rules and gotten themselves into life-threatening situations, Ron has zero faith that Harry wouldn't lie to him. Thus, Harry gets virtually abandoned by his first real friend in the midst of the whole school turning against him /again/. And actually, IIRC, they didn't even have a good, proper conversation before Ron decided that Harry must have cheated somehow. So despite Ron being Harry's best friend, he ends up being just like everyone else.

I think Ron is an incredibly realistic character who's deeply loyal to his friends and family, but one of his flaws is that he lets his wounded pride cloud his judgement sometimes. That's normal and it doesn't make him a bad person, especially as he was a 14 year old boy at the time. I do think it's reasonable to want to explore alternative ways that the Great Betrayal could have ended, because where Harry did nothing to hurt Ron (even if he thought he did), Ron did do something to hurt Harry.

**** And what the hell difference would it have made? Hermione really only made a difference at the point where Harry needed to learn the summoning charm (she was trying). Moral support was the best possible outcome from Ron, but it would have probably turned out literally the same in the story.

Anyway, there is a difference between choosing to talk to not speak or believe someone's claim and betraying them. What did Ron actually do? Not talk to Harry. Literally EVERYBODY else except a handful of teachers (maybe) believed he put his name in the goblet. You want to look at real problems, look at Sprout. She was a teacher, supposedly needing to remain fair and the head of the house of honesty and trust, and she treated Harry coldly.

Hell, Snape and Malfoy are actually not that big a deal. They were arses before, and arses after. Nothing really changed, just the wording.

Harry arguably saved everyone at the school. He certainly saved Ron at this point... Ron would have had a uncomfortable rendezvous with a Snake if Harry had lost.

Harry also saved Ron when he was a baby.

... And when he defeated Quirrelmort. An angry Voldemort who failed to get the stone, or an empowered one who won, while leaving the obstacle course might not have looked to fondly at a KO'd student who tried to stop him lying around.

#+begin_quote
  I don't remember anything like Ron's Chess game sacrifice.
#+end_quote

I've never read that as Ron being in any actual danger. But the whole sequence lacks any sense-making to begin with (why did the Chess puzzle reset if Voldemort already solved it? Why are there conveniently 3 pieces missing and not 1? Why would it even take other human players into account if it were designed to stop Voldemort?) , so I'm not in the mood to argue the point. Suffice it to say, Ron is either very brave or just bad at chess.

a presumed mass-murderer. But sure, okay, Ron saved Harry from getting a hug. Good job Ron. Not sure whether that makes up for him almost getting Harry killed by driving a flying car into a tree or urging him to use a broom sent by presumed mass-murderer or by holding Harry back with his lack of academic curiosity and ambition.

For Ron, when his adrenaline is pumping and he doesn't have time to think this kind of reaction seems almost instinctual: "Graah, don't you touch him/her! I will protect! GRYFFINDORRRR!" (I'm not trying to mock, it's one of his better qualities). I think he would do the same for Cormac McClaggen, it's a deep part of his character.

Ron's friendship is not challenged by dangerous situations, that's easy for him. I think we get better insights in his worth in that regard when he becomes uncomfortable or angry. And we know how those turned out.

Harry's parents were killed in the same encounter as Riddle was stopped for the first time. Ron had a happy childhood literally because Harry lost his parents.

Hermione literally erased her parents memories and personalities.

At the same time Ron's father continued to work in the Ministry even under Riddle's administration without any punishment for being part of the Order.

There were no reports about murders of pureblood Light wizards.

At that point Hagrid was professor for more than 4 years. While he is a little reckless there were no incidents of students being injured more seriously than during an average quidditch match.

I would understand him if it was male Carrow who took Ginny there to have some fun with a pretty girl. But Hagrid? Seriously?

I wonder if anyone ever bashes Hedwig? She gets in a snit and refuses to carry mail for Harry after he's entered in the Triwizard. Or maybe bashing Daphne Greengrass, standard-issue Slytherin love interest, for wearing a Potter Stinks badge (since every single Slytherin in Harry's potion class is explicitly wearing one)?\\
...Re-reading that part of the book, pretty much everybody is a bigger betrayer than Ron; he only gives Harry the silent treatment, he doesn't yell or fire any curses or wear a Potter Stinks badge or anything.

#+begin_quote
  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
