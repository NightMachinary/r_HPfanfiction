So I recently read through his Broken Chains / Stars Alone series, and I fell in love with it, it's one of the best fanfics I've come across. It's a massive plot about empire-building and Godlike Harry/Hermione/Luna curbstomping the Stargate universe. If you've read his stuff you'll know what I'm talking about, I'm just looking for anything similar to this.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.

** You should read the Simurgh Son's, it's mind blowing and uses some elements from his other stories.

This guy is so amazing that you just wait saturday after saturday for more chapters!

**** When I started reading it I knew nothing about worm, so far I've been able to understand some intricacies from the Worm universe, but at some point I'd like to see how it is without Harry Potter

** Firebird trilogy is also big and well written, although not as much curbstomp and no space...
