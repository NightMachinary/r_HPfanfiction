I have seen multiple fics such as Forging the Sword and On the Way to Greatness being recommended, but I don't want to read them as they haven't updated in forever.

**** For me, personally, fiendfyre seems to describe the spell rather than being it's incantation. Like the disarming spell would be expelliarmus and the patronus charm would be expecto patronum. In this case patronus charm = fiendfyre so expecto patronum = ????.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4563439/1/Ectomancer]])

Not entirely sure what fics you have and have not already ready, Ectomancer is probably one of my favourite ones. Pretty unique concept that had a lot of cool potential.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9172846/1/Deathly-Hallowed]])

Next up is a fic that is also one of my favourites. Never seen it mentioned here though. If you like the whole Lovecraft horror thing, then you might like this one. I could gush for a while about it but, just give it a try.

** I just read Forging the Sword for the first time a couple weeks ago, after having seen it recommended to me for the better part of a decade. Even though it's unlikely to be finished, it was definitely worth the read, though it was a bit preachy at times. And lets face it, the endings to most stories are usually quite lackluster or bad.

** linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom) is technically almost done, but abandoned afaik.

linkffn(The Willow Demon by Anubis Ankh) diverges from canon during the Final Battle in DH. The premise of the story is interesting.

** "Unspeakable Beauty" by QuirksnQuills if you like Luna/Harry (and even if you don't, this might convert you). It hasn't been updated in five years (maybe too long ago for your standards), but unlike most abandoned fics, which were abandoned because they'd lost the plot, this one seemed to have a clear idea of where it was going. I'm a little concerned as to what might have happened to the author...

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.
