So I am looking for something focusing on Tom Riddle during his Hogwarts years or during the First War. While there are a few out there, pretty much all I've found out either presents Tom in a humorous manner or it involves time travel. I would prefer something that sticks to the canon as much as possible and depicts Tom in a realistic way as the cruel, friendless bully he was.

** Oh you'll love Witchcraft by a Picture written by anyavioletta. Canon compliant, and fairly realistic in my mind, no time travel involved and typically only dark humour.

I think you'd like that. The author has other Tom Riddle stories, too.

** If you are interested in AUs, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3221511/1/The-Right-Hand-Path][The Right-Hand Path]] by Sophiax is a very well-written story in which Merope survives to raise Tom Riddle. Tom is still a sociopath, but a bit more prosocial. It's probably abandoned, unfortunately.
