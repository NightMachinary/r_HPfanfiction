To you guys what do Werewolves look like. To me there is 3 different kind of Werewolves.

1.) The monstrous wolf, is the result of the person taking Wolfsbane and not being one with their wolf. This kind is a monster with no control or memories

2.) A slightly big than normal wolf, the person doesn't take the Wolfsbane, also isn't one with the wolf. This one has some control and remembers the whole thing.

3.) Twilight size wolves, this person doesn't take Wolfsbane and is also one in their wolf. This one can change at will, the full moon will still force a change but this person is in complete control and remembers everything


** I think you have 1 and 2 mixed up. No wolfsbane and not one with the wolf would be monster who can't control themselves. Wolfsbane, not one with the wolf would be slightly bigger and recognize people, similar to a massive drunk wolf. I agree with three tho, Greyback for example.

** I always pictured werewolves to just look like giant hairy wolves only angry, and they definitely had tails in my brain. Not really sure what they were going for in the movie. Was animating fur not in their budget or something? Poor Remus looked like a bear suffering from mange after his transformation.

** Werewolves canonically don't transform into whatever was in the PoA movie, but into a wolf form that can only be distinguished from an actual wolf by several small physical characteristics such as pupils, snout shape and the tail. What makes them monsters isn't their appearance, but aggressivity and being magic.

** Wolfsbane, canonically, gives the drinker full control. The thing lupin turned into is what all werewolves in Harry Potter turn into. Also the reason lupin isn't in control is specifically because he DIDN'T drink the wolfsbane, not because of it.

**** Not to be rude but isn't that like saying you headcanon "Avada Kedavra" as a spell that brings back people instead of killing them?

** My go-to werewolves are the ones from Van-Helsing. They are perfect in every way.

** Twilight Werewolves aren't really werewolves, werewolves is what Bella and the Cullen call them because they see a man changing into a wolf and they immediately think Werewolf. But in reality they are Wolf Shapeshifters. It's a spiritual inheritance of the Quileute Tribe.

Although there ARE real Werewolves in Twilight. They are briefly mentioned. They are called "Children of the Moon" and they are almost extinct because they were all hunted down by one of the Volturi Kings.
