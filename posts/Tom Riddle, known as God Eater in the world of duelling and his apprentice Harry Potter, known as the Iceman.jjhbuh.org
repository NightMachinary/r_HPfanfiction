Just had a idea of a AU Fic where instead of going down the dark lord route Riddle simply wants to raise his own magical knowledge and power so after a decade of travelling and learning new and more esoteric magic he steps into the world of duelling.

Almost half a century after Tom Riddle graduates from Hogwarts he is globally recognized as one of the most powerful and intelligent Duelists on the planet and as a duelling champion.

The year is 1993 and It comes as a surprise to the magical community when Tom Riddle has taken an apprentice, a third year Hogwarts student named Harry Potter who while recognized to be talented at duelling isn't somebody who people would have pegged as Tom Riddles first choice of apprentice especially when he hasn't shown interest in having one before.

I don't particularly know why I gave the title of “God Eater” to Tom and “Iceman” to Harry but I felt like it just suits them.


** God Eater reminds me of Voldemort's title among the werewolves from Prince of the dark kingdom which is an AU where Voldemort wins, and mentors Harry. If you haven't read it, It's a great fic that goes through 7 years but sadly abandoned. :(

*** Ohh I think I remember reading it a really long time back, I never got through it so now might be a good time to go back and finish it even if it's abandoned. Thanks!
