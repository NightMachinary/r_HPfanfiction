There's a big spectrum of Voldemorts in the fandom, from complete idiot who wails as OP!Harry smashes his face to considerably smarter and more intimidating than he is in canon.

Villainous Dumbledore is basically always an idiot, either well-meaning but dangerously delusional or outright malicious, but very bad at it, typically neutralized by the goblins or Amelia Bones the moment Harry gets suspicious of him.

Have you ever seen a legitimately dangerous villainous Dumbledore? One who successfully maintains a canon!Dumbledore front for most of the story, who just replaces the leader of the goblins with his own puppet when they become an issue, and witnesses the tragic death of Amelia Bones at the hands of death eaters when she comes to arrest him?


** A real villian dumbledore would be interesting because everything is stacked heavily in his favor. I cant think of a non cheap way for him to be toppled outside of his hard throwing or just being an ignoranus.

Edit: actually wait, beneath red waters i believe had a villian dumbledore.

  “Blood of the friend, forcibly taken, you will resurrect your ally.”\\
  Voldemort is resurrected. It doesn't go exactly like in the books. This is what happens when I read a bunch of 'good Voldemort, evil Dumbledore' stories, and then try to imagine what it would actually be like for Severus Snape in such a universe during the thirteen years spent alone at Dumbledore's side. Here's a hint: Voldemort is not easily getting his spy out of Dumbledore's clutches. And saving Harry Potter may be a bit of a trial as well.

** Of a Linear Circle features a proper villainous Dumbledore, who has an actual motive (The Elder Wand didn't like how he didn't kill to take it and saw a prophecy forcing the holders of the other two Hallows as the perfect opportunity. It basically fried Dumbledore's will and drastically exacerbated his controlling tendencies.)

Instead of the usual paper tiger manipulation, the protagonists spend chapter after chapter working to figure out what's going on and working against him.

** In 'Harry Potter and the Ring of the Ancients' (sorry can't find a link these days for it), Dumbledore is the final villain and he is really powerful. For a while the situation seems hopeless once he reveals himself as evil and the only reason Harry manages to escape is through some quick thinking on his part. Unfortunately the story ends with a cliffhanger and as I've said, I can't find it anymore. Maybe someone might have it as a PDF.
