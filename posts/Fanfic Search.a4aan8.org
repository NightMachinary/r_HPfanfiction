I'm looking for a Harry/Hermione or Ginny Fanfic where they die or /something./ One scene involves them giving vampires a blood replenishing potion. They have a daughter, and she discovers what happens along the way. Ron raises her. I'm pretty sure it's told in flashbacks, and I really want to say the daughter's name is Hope, but I cannot for the life of me, find this fic. Edited to Add: Grimmauld Place vanishes under the fidelius at the end because dumbledore is dead and no one who knows the secret can pass it on.


** Is it linkffn(7024025)? Some of your descriptions ring a bell for me but I don't remember whether Grimmauld Place vanished in the end.

*** That's the right fic. Thanks. Honestly, the grimmauld place thing might be something I'm remembering from another fic. After awhile, some of the details blur together.
