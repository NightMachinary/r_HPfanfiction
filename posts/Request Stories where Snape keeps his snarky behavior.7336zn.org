I love Severus Snape, I can't even really say why I do, it's just his behavior. His more cynical and snarky/sarcastic behavior that I love. Now of course I probably wouldn't be able to hang out with him in real life; or at least for very long, but even so I love his character.

But even so, there's so many stories that can't write his character very well; no fault to him, he is a very difficult character to write after all.

But, after a while they seem to give up on his character and write him a little nicer,and while I don't mind that I want him to keep his usual behavior that he has throughout the story.

Now of course if there's character development for him in the story and he gets better, that's fine. But I still want him to have his wit that he has.

Any rating is fine, am fine with het/slash/femslash.

Would rather the story be completed, but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

Any pairing is fine, would love to see his snarky behavior raising Harry, just because again people tend to have him get over his hatred for James pretty quickly when he raises Harry, which isn't very believable, or at least not as fast as he gets better. But him raising Harry isn't mandatory.


** linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions) has the most in-character Snape I recall.

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

** I believe this fanfiction has quite a bit of snarky!Snape, though warning: it does have some Hermione-bashing and minor Dumbledore-bashing. It does not focus on Snape, though, he is in the beginning of this.

** linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) This is part of a huge AU with amazing world building and lots of things going on but he is a major character here. He doesn't really despise Harry in this fic due to the way this AU is set up, but he is still perfectly in character with sarcasm and cynism and his unique attitude. It's also almost an extremely slow going going Severitus fic (although they aren't related). They live together during summers and their interactions with each other are completely awesome, full of great snarky dialogue and a relationship that is distant but very close due to them going through a lot of stuff together. Sadly this fic is incomplete, although it is certainly one of the longest ones I have seen.

linkffn(Keep Your Enemies Closer) An AU where Voldemort becomes aware that Harry is a Horcrux. Snape is definitely his canon self, although the fic isn't finished and I don't believe he and Harry ever move past hate of each other in this one.

linkffn(In blood only) An older Severitus fic (before half blood prince I think) with Snape very in character and not where he accepts Harry easily at all.

Linkffn(Stronger than Hope) Snape guardian/mentor fic

Some almost HGSS fics where Harry doesn't really feature much, but Snape is very in character:

linkffn(Pet Project) There is romance at the end only, easily skippable.

linkffn(The professor's discretion)
