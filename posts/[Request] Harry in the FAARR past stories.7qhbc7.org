So, I've been watching a lot of ancient battle tactics videos, courtesy of Historia Civilis on Youtube. I'm wondering if there are any stories in the fanfiction world where Harry is in ancient times, before even the founding of Hogwarts, where he participates in battles or just lives with ancient civilizations.

I've read that one story with fem Harry in Egypt. The name escapes me, though I did enjoy it as it even went over her meeting/mentoring/training Merlin, which was pretty neat.


** linkffn(Voldemort's Last Spell by Louis IX)

ABANDONED!

After 1981's Helloween Harry is accidentally sent to many many years ago. He is immortal and travels the world. When I read it I liked it very much though [[/spoiler][you can change name of our main character and nothing will change. I even think it can be considered an original, lol]]. But still worth reading. It's very interesting.

*** Thank you for this story! I think I read it a long time ago, but it was refreshing to read something so unique one more time.

Edit: "Wow. This story reminds me a bit of the movie 'The Last Man from Earth', especially when [[/s][Spoiler]]

Edit 2: It went an interesting place that I wish it hadn't gone. [[/s][Spoiler]]

***** It got a bit more on track afterwards but probably could have ended in chapter 8, rather than continuing. Chapter 9 was still an interesting read, but it definitely shows its age when it comes to cliches.

I think the crossover was just kind of haphazardly thrown in because the author might have liked the universe and wanted it in the story rather than for some real story development.

  Voldemort intended to kill the whole Potter family, but something unexpected happened. Now, the Dark Lord must face the result of a severely twisted Prophecy as well as a very old... thing. What history can Harry have after this? What history can he make?

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

***** There's also The Wizard from Earth by Morta's Priest, from which Rakeesh admits drawing "some inspiration". Not as good as A Long Journey Home and also sadly unfinished, but definitely worth a read. linkffn(8337871)

  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future.

** Linkffn(Basilisk-born by Ebenbild)

Harry is taken to the time of Merlin and witnesses and participates in many critical events of the day. It's working it's way towards modern time. Well written and worth a read.
