:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
He can often seem to be a buffoon. But he also knows everybody in the ministry and can alter legislation. Something like that.

I think she mentally compares him to one of those optical illusions that can appear to be two completely different things depending on how you look at it.

Also I think that she was watching him struggle to light a fire non magically as she was pondering.

Anybody know the fic?


** I don't know about that, but I just remember this little bit explaining Arthur's apparent buffoonery.

** linkffn(*Forging the Sword*) has a scene like this, though the fic seem to be, sadly, abandoned.
