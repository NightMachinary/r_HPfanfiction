I don't know if it's just me but every single fic about Harry being dark either A. inexplicably change his entirely personality or B. have nothing to do with him actually delving into the ancient and lost arts of dark magic more so he's just a dick and Dumbledore is evil or something. If i'm wrong, please correct me. If not, let's bitch about it together.


** I actually like the ones that show the effects of the abuses he likely sustained at home and being sent back every summer. Because he would definitely have some issues.

Canon ignores it, but I'm sure that just a closet under the stairs was the least of his experiences.

*** I agree with that. I like when his abuses are brought into play rather than being blatantly ignored. My problem lies more that people don't really play off that, and if they do then it's like the first chapter and then never touched on again.

**** I can't name any off the top of my head at the moment. But I remember some where Harry got really good at spotting body language and could tell when people were trying to lie or manipulate him. That he used this info for his own ends. He was no ones tool or victim.

** That's... the genre though? Dark!Harry means that Harry is a Bad Guy, doesn't it? As in, the name refers to his 'Dark' personality, rather than what magic he uses.

Also, there's considerable debate in the fandom (or at least considerably-different held positions) on whether Dark Magic makes people evil or just attracts those prone to evil things. Was Bella a monster before she started using Unforgiveables, or did her using them turn her Dark? As far as I'm aware, we don't really know, canonically speaking.

And then there's the crowd that says Dark Magic is just a legal distinction and it really isn't all that bad or evil, just misunderstood. I believe their works tend to be categorised under the 'Indy!Harry' and 'Pureblood Culture' labels most often, so I'd suggest that if those are what you're looking for, you should try search those things instead.

*** Fair enough. I just have a different view of what it means. I never really got a written description of what the genre entails so forgive me if i'm wrong. My problem lies more in the lack of development of his character. I like him being evil, it's interesting. I hate when it's bland or inexplicable.

**** Ah, fair. Yeah, the 'Dark' Personality thing was always how I saw it - I could also be wrong, though. :D

In terms of lacking character development - that's just the nature of fandom, I'm afraid. We're enthusiastic amateurs, one and all. There's some gems in the rough, but most of us are still rough, I'm afraid. We'll get better and work some stuff out, but there's a reason professional writers rely so heavily on editing. It really helps a work get from good to great. And since we aren't professional writers and don't have professional editors, there's only so far we can get and it's just a thing across lots of categories. Indy!Harry fics do the same with mystical powers and purchased artifacts, romance fics do the same with the less romance-y elements, etc. It's quite difficult to keep a tight, useful plot weave going without a lot of experience or assistance.

If you want stuff that tends to meet higher standards, I'd recommend signing up to the Dark Lord Potter forums. Everything there is cultivated and rated and reviewed (very bluntly) and if it doesn't satisfy, it doesn't make the cut.

***** True true. I think that's part of the charm though. This is where aspiring writers and amateurs can come and make their deepest imaginations into the written word. Thanks for the reply kind stranger!

In theory, potentially, but not too much in practice. It's usually "dark but not evil" and that equates to self-righteous ranting and raving. Everyone just accepts that he does and studies Dark magic because those who don't are bigots. Don't get me wrong, I prefer Dark but not evil, it's just never been written in a way I like.

Word of God tells us all jinxes, hexes and curses are Dark magic, which implies that Dark magic doesn't make you evil, it's just a lot of evil people do it.

Yeah. Moral shades can be so fun, but it's a very difficult balance to strike. Go too far and you end up with Genocidal Dictators who love to Garden, and don't go far enough and you end up with Anakin Skywalker "From my perspective, the Jedi are evil!" types. I do feel like a lot of the people writing those kinds of things do need to read and experience more outside the HP World, because there are some really great examples in other media to draw from.

I'd say a personal favourite example, if you haven't read it, is 'An Unfound Door' by Joe. The Harry in that is probably the closest I've seen in the fandom to that kind of 'dark but not evil' type.

I haven't seen that one. That'd be interesting to play around with though - everyone at all ages seems to use jinx and hexes, so it'd be fun if those did have an ever-so-slight subtle mental effect. Sort of a minor version of the old 'you reducto one person, it becomes easier to reducto a second' thing.

And a lot of people would agree with you. But others would disagree. Like everything else in this fandom, it's a spectrum. :)

I'm of the 'no bad ideas, just ideas in need of more work' opinion, myself. Just gotta find a plot that would help the 'everyone is culturally against a certain section of magic' thing work well. :)
