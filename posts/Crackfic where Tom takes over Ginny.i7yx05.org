:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember reading a crackfic where Ginny is possessed by Voldemort/Tom except he's obsessed with Harry.

At the end of it they get married, and Ginny gives birth to a kid and comes to herself because Voldemort was transferred to the kid.

What's that fic?


** so the fic was "The Chronicles of the Dark Lord Ginnymort" which has been removed from ff.net :(
