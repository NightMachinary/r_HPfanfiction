The twins are seen as the good Weasleys (if Harry interacts with the Weasleys at all) and looking at canon I can't see why. They're bullies. Are there any fics where someone tells them this? It can be Ron, it can be Harry, I don't care.


** Knowledge is Power by RobSt has Harry calling out the Twins on their Bullying.

I believe there's a short called Thanks Minerva in a shorts collection called Odd Ideas of a Strange Muse by broomstick flyer that has the twins called out on their bullying

  When Hermione gets cursed at the Ministry, Harry and the Death Eaters discover the power he knows not. Unleashing this power has far reaching consequences. Weasley and Dumbledore bashing -- time travel story that's hopefully different.

  Well it seems that quite a few writers have a folder for their odd ideas or drabbles so I have decide on one for the odd tales we come up with from time to time. Some of the stuff in here will complete, some just small parts we could not use. Enjoy.
