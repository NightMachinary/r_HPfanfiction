hey - sorry if this isn't how things are done here, but rather than go to a website to upload I thought I'd share with you lovely folk. (If it has to be linked to be a promo, I'll load it somewhere then link youse) :)

I sholud mention here - Callum Darragh is a character I've used before, so there isn't a full introduction. He's a muggle born member of house slytherin, who was forced to flea the Carrows. Circumstances in a different fanfic brought him together with Neville to have an intermitently hilarious and grim adventure running the resistance inside Hogwarts. Callum is a native Gaelic (Gàidhlig) speaker, and started dating Draco shortly after Draco defected (i should really finish that other fic, it's much more interesting than this one)

oh, and strong language (like, I'm Scottish, so it's used as normal people from Scotland speak. it serves it's own strange grammatical function so that might seem parochial to my dialect)

Shedding Skins\\
§1 - In which Draco is comforted by a Nun explaining aerodynamics.

............

Draco wore a tight, emerald green shirt, with quite short sleeves, which showed off his pecs and triceps. He'd put on a lot of muscle weight since Christmas. Since leaving the toxic environment of Malfoy Manner eight months ago Draco had become astonishingly vain. He wore his long, fair hair up in a bun, with his want stuck through it. It looked appallingly Hipsterish, but for a Wizard with so little understanding of the muggle world, it was useful to let Muggles expect certain things (aloofness, pretension, crypticness) as they interacted with them. This could help him avoid subjects that he would have no understanding of, and gave Muggles something to explain away any odd responses. The Hipster looks would have been completed with non-prescription glasses, or a beard, but Callum had forbidden either. Usually, Draco looked impressive in this look, fair, pale, silver eyes, with chiseled cheekbones - there was something rather sidhe about him. That's not to mention the muscles in just the right proportion to set off a fitted t-shirt. At this moment, however, he looked far from impressive. He was chalk white, sweating, and crushing the bones in Callum's hand. His other hand was holding his airplane seat so tightly that blood had stopped flowing to his fingers. He'd been agitated for the entire flight, but when the captain put the seatbelt sign back on, and announced their final descent to Toronto, Darco had panicked. In preparation for this flight, Draco had availed himself of Callum's Netflix and DVD collection. He had a list of shows and film about planes, which he found online, and binged on ‘Aircrash Investigation', ‘Airplane!', ‘Snakes on a Plane', and ‘100 Last Flights'. Callum had spend an hour afterwards googling safety statistics with him to calm him down. Draco had been insistent they use portkey, or brooms to fly it. Portkeys were currently forbidden in the UK, in order to prevent war criminals from fleeing, and Callum was not about to fly the fucking atlantic on a broom.\\
“Callum, Callum, something's wrong.” Draco said, clutching at his head, “It hurts, oh fuck it's...”\\
“Draco, calm down. That's normal. It's safe, nothing bad happens. It's just the pressure changing. Try swallowing. It makes it better.”\\
Draco usually would have a witty (read: smutty) rejoinder, but he simply complied this time.\\
“Here, suck one of these, my love.” The nun on the other side of Draco removed her earphones from underneath her wimple and offered him a polo mint.\\
Callum had whispered to Draco that he should ask to sing ‘Only One River' with her, and earned a jab in his ribs in response.\\
“First time flying?” She asked, with a gentle, Canadian accent.\\
“Yes.” Draco said weakly, taking the polo, slipping it under his tongue, and taking Callum's hand again.”\\
“It's alright. I do this all the time. It's perfectly safe. The wings are deigned to move air around them at different speeds on different sides. The top side has fast moving air, so that it creates low pressure, and the underside has slower moving air, which creates higher pressure. That creates lift, and keeps us up. We land leaning back a bit, so that more air is hitting the underside, keeping us up.” She held up her hand with her piny and thumb stretched out as if to represent wings, and mimicked the descent of a plane, leaning back to expose more underside. “So the captain can let gravity do it's work, but as slowly as he-“ there was the gentlest tap as the hind wheels made contact with the ground- “wants it to, so-” and the front wheels, “we can land smoothly. Just like that.”\\
Draco hadn't realised they'd landed, but as the wind roared over the opening wing flaps he became more worried.\\
“It's just the wing flaps. THey're opening up to create drag ... slow us down naturally. Imagine you're on something fast moving, if you sit up you'll slow down a bit.” As a seeker, Draco was familiar with this sensation. Callum leant in, and whispered to Draco “let's get you a light sleeping draught for the way back, aye?” Draco nodded, then nestled his head onto Callum's shoulder, and reached over to rest his free hand on the hand Callum was holding his unfree hand with. Callum looked over to the nun with a thankful, and slightly apologetic look. He had never seen a more nervous flyer than Draco, and didn't mean to ruin her flight. She smiled broadly and laughed a little. Draco must have looked like an adorable puppy.

Standing in the line to have their passports checked, an interesting looking figure with lots of tattoos and atypical piercings commented on the tattoo on Draco's forearm.\\
“Dude, that looks awesome. Is that watercolour style?” Draco told him it was. He rose his forearm so that the stranger could see the elegant, watercolour tattoo of a phoenix, over the soft, noticeably paler, rectangle of skin which had been grafted onto Draco's forearm. The stranger asked what had happened to his arm.\\
“Oh, I had a nasty chemical burn there a while ago. They just had to get rid of the skin. Had a synthetic skin on for a bit and they took some skin off my arsecheeks to cover it.” He pointed to the thin, less noticeable scar running down the middle of the graft. “They couldn't get enough off either cheek, so they tool a little from both.” The guy, who introduced himself as ‘Creg', found this fascinating.\\
“So, where on the ass do they take if from?” Is there just a gap in the skin in the middle of your ass cheeks?” He laughed.\\
“No, from the underside, where it meets the thigh. Take a little fat out as well, shove a little about, so they can close the wound.”\\
“His arse has never looked better.” Callum chimed in. ‘Creg' (‘it's an American name', Callum latter told Draco) fell back laughing, Callum grinned, and Draco punched him in the shoulder.\\
The stranger extracted mobile numbers from Draco and Callum, and suggested they all get a drink some time, or they could watch his band play. Callum and Draco were let through passport control (Callum had been nervous that Draco's passport might have been flagged - Callum had procured it by means of hte Imperius Curse the year before, when he was laying contingency plans in case he needed Draco out of the country), and were sent on their way. They took a taxi to a flat in the more bohemian side of the city, and were buzzed up to an apartment.

When the door opened Callum was grabbed by the shoulder and dragged into a smothering hug.\\
“I am so fucking glad to see you.” Callum's elder brother, Dòmhnall said in Gaelic. “Don't ever fucking do that again.” Callum held his brother as tightly as possible, for far longer than was usual for a hug. Eventually, he was released, and the two stood in silence. It wasn't until he saw his brother's eyes glistening that he realised the tears creeping down his own face. At last, Dòmhnall beckoned them both inside. They had some jasmine green tea nonesense that Dòmhnall was into, Draco was introduced to Dòmhnall, and Dòmhnall found every way to express the thought “don't go to war again” in Gàidhlig and several in English. Draco sat in silence for about an hour while the brotehrs spoke in Gaelic, before they realised how rude they were being. When Dòmhnall went to the toilet, Draco rested his hand softly on Callum's forearm.\\
“You've not seen each other in a year and he thought you were going to die. Use your language. I'll cook for us.” He held up a hand to stop Callum protesting, “It'll keep my out of the road, and you two can talk in Gaelic.”

Dòmhnall had been born on Lewis, while both of his parents were on sabbaticals (they were academics). He'd been raised speaking Gàidhlig in the house, went to a Gàidhlig nursery, and didn't speak English until he went to primary school. When Callum had been born, he'd spent the first year and a half only speaking Gàidhlig, but he'd been reasonably conversational in English before he went to primary. Draco pulled the ingredients for a vegetable jalfrezi out of one of those brown paper grocery bags you only on american TV, and set to work in the kitchen. Callum and Dòmhnall spend the next two hours talking. Callum felt Draco was cooking slowly on purpose. By the time Draco announced “ten minutes till dinner”, they had more or less cleared the air of the wide and erratic range of emotions. Dòmhnall laid the table for dinner, and Draco presented the fiery smelling concoction.\\
“I was telling Dòmhnall about the DADDh club in the Common Room when Umbridge was teaching.”\\
Draco paused.\\
“The what club? DADA?”\\
Callum paused for a bit and Dòmhnall snorted through his beer. The ‘dh' sound at the end had let him know.\\
Callum took a moment to prepare for the modest slagging that was coming his way.\\
“The ... fucks sake,” he addressed his plate and laughed, he turned back to face Draco, grinning, “So I've been talking to Dòmhnall all night and I called it /Dìon an Aghaidh Droch Dhraoidheachdan/. /Dìon/, Defence; /an Aghaidh/, against, in the face of; /Droch Dhraoidheachd/, evil magic. DADDh. But yes, I meant DADA - for your delicate ... fucking ... sasanach ears.”\\
Dòmhnall lauched again and choked on his curry. Draco laughed, but asked:\\
“What does ‘sasnick' mean? I've heard it before, think Cho called me it once when I went past her after I caught the snitch against them.”\\
Callum laughed.\\
“Cho's from Fife, she doesn't know what it means. It's the Gaelic word for an English person, but some Scots who don't speak Gaelic think it's an insulting term for southerner.” He paused, “And if you're Scottish the people to the south are the English anyway.” This explanation didn't offer Draco much. Draco's Gaelic went as far as “/Is mise Draco. 'S e spithear a th'ann/.”, “/Tha gaol agam ort./”, and a few of the flirtatious (or outright sordid) phrases Callum would sometimes utter to him. He's spent almost no time in Scotland outside of the castle, or Callum's home in Glasgow.

Callum had returned to his parent's house with Draco, however his parents were still in Massachusetts. Draco had stayed there, but hadn't been encouraged to talk to many muggles. He wasn't fluent in muggle culture, and he was still in that strange state most people were in after the Battle of Hogwarts, where they could function perfectly well for hours at a time, and would spend hours at a time staring into the middle distance. Callum had been the same, but he'd forced himself into a routine that left him no time to dwell. It had kept him moving, but it wasn't obviously a solution to the problem. Callum hadn't mentioned it to anyone but he felt like the impact of the battle was still to hit him. He kept his guns about him. He worked out every morning. He spent hours reading books on military history, history of espionage, and war poetry - as if he was still preparing for the battle.

--------------

Kinglsy Shacklebolt had accepted the surrender of the Minister of Magic, on behalf of the Ministry, and the Death Eaters. He had been imposed as Interim Minister for Magic, and had called on the Leadership of all anti-Death Eater factions, which included his associates in the Order of the Phoenix, Callum and Neville from the DA, Professor McGonnigle, and the Heads of Houses at Hogwarts, and a few small, dissident factions who had been harrying the Death Eaters' weaker garrisons. After many hours, and with little idea of what to do next, Callum begged them to bring in outside help to mediate the conflict. He had suggested calling on the International Wizarding community, and was told that no such thing existed. There had not been an international agreement on anything other than dealing with Sports (and occasionally dragons) since the Statute of Secrecy. Callum then moved his Queen out.\\
“The Muggles have seen this before, many times. it is going to keep happening again until we redress three huge problems in the Wizarding community in the UK.”\\
At this point he was interrupted by the leader of one of the dissident factions, who told him, in not so few words, that attempting to learn from the muggle world was useless as they were strange and alien to wizards, and had peculiar, stunted, outlooks on the world. At this point Slughorn and McGonnigle both got ready to interrupt to stop Callum saying anything rash, but Neville simply buried his head in his hands - resigned to what would come.\\
“Well, the first thing I'd say is that the motivations of Wizards and Muggles are fundamentally the same, especially just after a conflict,” Callum began here, where he was sure he was on firm ground, and where he was less likely to shout, “They are motivated by love of their families, desire for food, shelter, desire that they and their families are not murdered in the dark, and they want to feel part of a community. If there are grievances after a conflict, and if people feel they need to take sides, then they tend to feel like they belong to this group, they see that group, and worry that someone in that group might murder them in revenge for something done during the war. So sometimes they form militias to defend themselves, which is seen as provocation, or escalation - and conflict heats up again. It's happened a thousand time and a wand doesn't change how people feel about their families, their communities, or their safety.” He had kept a stern, but fairly level tone through this, which allowed McGonnigle and Slughorn to relax, but Callum continued, “however if you think that the ability to use magic means that Wizards know anything better than Muggles, I will point out that you impose poverty on your citizens because you refuse to think about economcis ... it's the Muggle name for the study of how goods are distributed. You have no liberal arts education, and so the population is entirely unable to deal with the civic space, and your total refusal to learn from the world around you has left you with no supranational organisations, and a governmental structure that was begging for a fascist dictatorship. Now, I only got what education in the Muggle world that I could cram into my summers, and books my brother sent me, but at fifteen I looked at the Ministry of Magic and realised that it was wilsly unstable, and a Coup d'Etat was almost inevitable.” Callum looked around the room, he had the attention of Shacklebolt, McGonnigle, Neville (who'd heard this a thousand times before), and the newly appointed Editor of the Daily Profit, who had been invited to sit ex officio. These were the people who he needed to convince. “So we need to do three things. Firstly, we need to solve the problem of people not feeling safe among their neighbours - to do this we contact a Muggle organisation called the United Nations. It's dealt with precisely this problem dozens of times, to varying degrees of success, but even the least effective Truth and Reconciliation Commissions work better when the numbers are even and the public is armed. Eevryone has a wand so we need to take the motivation for violence away. A Truth and Reconciliation Commissions is step one. Secondly, we need to sort out the governmental structure. People need a clean break from the past, and we need the government to be more accountable. We need both sides to feel they will be listened to by the Ministry. A Constitutional Convention, in which we restructure how Wizarding government works in its entirety wont solve that completely, but it's a start. We need a Constitutional Convention. Step three...”\\
“Wait, what?” A member of the Order who Callum didn't know interjected, “You want the Death Eaters to feel like they can influence the Ministry?”\\
Callum paused for a moment, and chose his words carefully.\\
“We need them to feel like they can have their grievances addressed by political means, otherwise they'll relly on something else. Unless your plan is to use the Ministry's apparatus to murder everyone with Death Eater sympathies, we need them to play the game. If that is your plan, go for it, but know that I will raise up another army and I'll kill you.”\\
“I thought you didn't want a return to violence.” Slughorn shot across, pointedly.\\
“I don't want that, so we need a form of government where people can solve their problems without violence. This does not involve a single Minister, elected for life or till he has the grace to resign, who can impose himself on the judiciary, and holds complete legislative discretion. We need a proper government, and Wizarding history offers no examples. So we need a Constitutional Convention, in which the citizens get involved, we talk about different models of government, and decide on something workable. If the Wizarding Community choose the same thing again, we're all going to die. Step three,” he tried to push past any further interjection, “is Liberal Arts Education. Professor,” he turned to McGonnigle, “this is something very important for you to consider. Wizarding citizens learn how to control magic, and they learn a story about how Wizarding Britain came to be the way it is. At no point are we taught to criticise, question, or think about how things should be. We have no education in literature, moral thinking, political science, science for that matter, - the closest we get is four years of victor's history. The Liberal Arts are, the idea goes, those subjects you need to have at least a basic understanding in if you are to be able to be a citizen. The Wizarding community does not live in the poverty of the 15h century, but the relationships between people are still, more or less, at that level. I know there were reasons for the Wizarding community to turn inwards, but you literally just missed the Renaissance. Since then, the Muggle world, particularly in Europe, went through huge, changes, and you haven't been paying anything like enough attention. Teach young Wizards to question, to imagine the lives of others, and teach them how to interrogate hte world. You will have harider citizens at the end of that, who are not so easily swayed by the rhetoric Voldemort relied on.”\\
Callum had deliberately used Voldemort's name at the end, to distract from the rather bitter criticisms he had made of the Wizarding community. He had not expressed that as levelly and dispassionately as he would have liked, but now any defence of the Wizarding world was not going to be a continuous response to what he said, because several of the rather unimportant people in the room were outraged by the use of the name.\\
Callum let them clamour for a moment, then quelled their yammering:\\
“It's just a name. The Taboo is lifted, his army is disbanded, and I was standing six meters away when an RAF Airman whom I'd put under the Imperius Curse shot him in the neck, chest, and stomach with a high powered rifle. I took his head off with the Sword of Gryffindor myself. I promise you, he's not going to hurt you.”\\
It occured to Callum, that after this display, it would be a little harder for any of the important people in the meeting to argue that the Wizarding world had some kind of wisdom that Muggles lacked. Callum didn't want to convince the committee that they were all savages (which he didn't entirely believe), only to plant the seed of those three ideas. He'd talk to them each individually and work on them. Kingsley seemed not to want to go down that tangent either, so he pulled the meeting back to the agenda.\\
“We shall note those suggestions, a Truth and Reconciliation Commission was it called? Organised by the Muggle United Nations. A Constitutional Convention, discussing how to rearrange the Ministry, and the introduction of subjects to encourage citizenship at Hogwarts. I feel these are valuable suggestions, but they will require much more discussion. I think I will table further conversations at a latter date. For now can we turn to item 4 on the agenda: the search for any other Horcruxes, or any other Death Eaters who might seek to revive Voldemort”

--------------

In the time he'd be away, while Kingsley was prepairing to ‘drop in on' the Secretary General of the UN, Callum had gone to Canada to see his brother, then to go south to see his parents. He'd finish in New York where he'd help talk to the UN about magic, the war, and what they were hoping could be done.

For now, however, he and Draco would share Dòmhnall's pull out couch, and hold each other very close in the dark, as images of the dead slid past their eyes.
