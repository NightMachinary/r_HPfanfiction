** May i ask about your posting schedule? I admit that I have seen your fic before and was intrigued by the description, but I do hesitate with starting new fics on the frequent chance that the writer gives up on it midway or takes a break of months before updating and I find myself having lost the plot and just give up on it entirely.

*** I try to maintain a biweekly posting schedule - every two weeks on Sunday. Occasionally, because of real life, a chapter will come out a week late - or I'll have two in quick succession.

I just posted CH12, but I'm already almost done with 13. I suspect it'll be out this Sunday - as an apology for the tardiness with the current chapter.

In any manner, I do have my fic planned out, so even if it takes a while to finish (length-wise) there won't be many - if any - long dry periods.

Cheers

*** It depends, lol.

Right now I'm in the Pre-Hogwarts stage, and Harry's not even 9 years old.

Fleur would be introduced only in a couple of years, but it's a possibility. It'll just take a while for me to make any kind of decision regarding romance, that's all. Also need to keep in mind what fits the narrative.

******* Honestly - I haven't put much thought into a definite pairing. Harry might have some romances, but I don't know which will be 'the one'.

However, I do have some idea of pairings which wont show up:

Harry/Hermione Harry/Ginny Harry/Luna

That's all. The rest, I think, are all open for consideration.

Predisposed notions? Yikes.
