** I really like reading things that redeem Snape in some manner. I think half the reason he's so awful is his upbringing and friends, not just his personality. So seeing that removed and watching how he changes is fun for me.

I don't like crack fics. I can't handle the humor in them.

I think I will try just about any fic once though to see if I like it!

*** I think the problem might be that you haven't read /good/ crack ficks, but then again not everyone enjoys that sort of humor.

You ever read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10685852/1/On-a-Pale-Horse][On a Pale Horse]]? It barely qualifies as crack, but you'll still find yourself chuckling evilly. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] is good for that too; the problem I have found is that often when an author is deliberately trying to be funny the jokes fall flat. Humor should arise naturally.

Black Comedy was hands down, the most hilarious fic i've ever read, even if the ending was so "out there" that made Luna's theories sound reasonable. For the longest time, I thought crack-fic meant a fic with stupid OP and bash with unreasable pairings and such. Only later I found that it isn't that, by reading "Tis the season of Summertime".

****** Yeah, if BBT is the extent of your journey into sitcoms, have I got some suggestions for you:

- Parks and Recreation: One of the best workplace comedies of all time, with just enough awkwardness to make it funny without it being unwatchable at other points (I'm looking at you, The Office) and a truly heartwarming message underneath it all.

- Brooklyn-99 is potentially the most reliably funny sitcom of all time. The jokes are smart, fast, and everywhere. Also, there's no one person who's the butt of all the jokes in the group and everyone is actually good at their job and a decent person, which is so rare for a sitcom.

- Community. My favorite show, and sitcom, of all time. It can be dark and heartwarming in equal measure, incredibly profound and laugh out loud funny in the same joke, and every joke is layered in way that makes you peel back the onion each time you rewatch an episode. Cannot recommend enough.

If [[/u/the-phony-pony]] end up watching any of these, I'd love to hear your thoughts on them as someone who'd (presumably) written off most sitcoms!

**** I'll shoot off a few:

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) has a Snape that doesn't have to deal with Lily's death hanging over his head, as well as two Potter kids, one of which is VERY much like James and another who is not (I.e. Harry), which lets him be far more balanced and rational with Harry.

linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) has Snape as a major character, in a mentor role to Harriet Potter in disguise as the son of Sirius Black, which should say worlds about his difference from canon Snape :P

For more straightforward Severitus, I can recommend linkffn(The Best Revenge by Arsinoe de Blessoe) and linkffn(Better Be Slytherin! by jharad17), as well written and interesting Snape redemption fics. TBR is fairly lighthearted, in my opinion, while BBS is the most realistic portrayal I've come across of how canon Snape would actually come to care for Harry.

For the sake of in-thread brevity, I will select a few from each.

/Pet peeves/

- Depiction of the wizarding world as stuck in the past, or having Victorian values. Wizarding society is its own unique thing, not Muggle society 100 years ago. In many respects it is more liberal than Muggle society. In some respects it is more conservative.

- Making rare and obscure magic relatively common knowledge, in particular occlumency and horcruxes.

- Non-permanent transfiguration.

- Taking an absence of an explicit explanation in canon and assuming a plot hole that can be exploited, rather than something that the reader just doesn't know. E.g. Magically binding agreements exist in canon but they are not used extensively to guarantee loyalty and honesty across society. Since the limitations on oaths/contracts are not explicitly explained, the author assumes that there are no limitations and wizards are just too stupid to have seen the exploit.

/Pet delights/

- Complex magical theory which does not devolve into a science analogue e.g. that avoids the use of formulas that are reminiscent of the formulas of physics, only with magical units instead of physical ones.

- Politics being more than the possession of titles.

- Harry learning through doing. He can master some very advanced, powerful magic when he learns it in this way. One example is the Patronus charm, another is his apparent mastery of occlumency in DH.

As for transfiguration, how do you feel about it being called something else instead when implying permanence? Or some sort of name identifying it as a branch if transfiguration like alchemy, or transmutation?

In the same way a spell is a charm if it makes a teapot dance for a bit. But an Enchanted teapot can dance whenever it wishes or is activated depending on the skill of the caster. T

** Pet Peeves: Canon apologists who make up shit to excuse slavery, torture, and bigotry. No, I don't want to read how dementors torturing prisoners into insanity is alright because otherwise, they would do much, much worse. In canon, they can't pass through walls, so they can be sealed off. No, I don't want to hear how slavery is OK because the elves aren't human. If the author doesn't even realise that they're parroting drivel from 19th-century slavery apologists, just with "elves" instead of "blacks", then they should educate themselves. No, I don't want to read about how ignorant mudbloods are, and how perfect and special pureblood society is, and how wrong it is to question a cesspit with legalised slavery and torture.

Goblins being glorified house-elfs JUST BECAUSE HE'S POLITE, like REALLY ??? Its like being polite to a supermarket clerk, just because you are, he isn't going to give the groceries.

4+ Lordships (the most i can handle are Potter, Black, Perverell and Slytherin (conquest or blooline through either Perverell's side or Lily's side, I don't mind, as long its explained and makes an ounce of logic in that particular fanfic) - If it goes into Gryff- Ravenclaw or shit like that, with 10 12 houses, man, that just kills the fic for me.

Hiperbolic chamber like in DBZ

Harem because of Lordships with insta-love, without any sort of romance and development. Also Harem's in general are a big NoNo for me.

** Lordships. The only Lord title in the Wizarding world is the one Lord Voldemort picked for himself. They're usually just a pretext for making Harry eligible for his Hermione+Daphne+Fleur harem.

Weasley bashing. Of all bashing, it's usually the cheapest and most clichéd. Unlike other bashing, it's also not as self-aware: they are simply not even aware that they're doing it, because they're so influenced by fanon.

Wrong ages. Tonks is in her twenties when Harry meets her, so it's unlikely that Andromeda was just a year ahead of MWPP. Also, Lucius' age (41 when Harry starts his fifth year) is /book canon/. And don't get me started on Molly and Arthur...

Seer Luna. It's just cheap, and a "justification" for her being as dotty as her father.

Shit tier fanon that claches with book canon. No, Riddle didn't use a "trace free" wand, and Harry wouldn't be caught if his trace didn't pick up magic in /number four, Privet Drive/.

I love completely and utterly ooc Dracos that are ridiculously overpowered.

I also love an op genius but socially inept Severus.

I like Ron and the Weasleys.

I like Marauder bashing.

I really like it if the protagonist is ugly.

I like stories that are set in the past that ignore the canon future, Grindeldore, Snily, Dumbledore adopts Tom Riddle etc. gimme dat.

Edit: I like extreme slow burns, especially if they are because there is more to the story than just lovey dovey stuff, 200k words before the first kiss? Yes, please.

No,no:

I am annoyed if Harry is very powerful.

I cannot stand "movie Hermione" and any other partner for Hermione than Ron is almost torture for me.

But the absolute worst thing are characters that are suppossed to be adults but act like idiotic 3 year olds just it helps the plot.

Edit: oh and I HATE it when every character trait and action and emotion is explained by the houses, like there are exactly four ways to be, that makes me more crazy than anything else. I hate it.

  :END:

- Death Eater redemptions. They ought to rot in Azkaban for their part in the magical Waffen-SS, even if they realized the error of their ways. Their victims deserve justice, and anything short of lifetime imprisonment for murder and terrorism is an insult to them.

- Molly as a mother figure for Harry. She is (arguably) not a bad mother, but the way she acts, or rather does not act, about the Dursleys in CoS and GoF makes any positive views from Harry's point of view unbelievable for me. Also she was a dick towards Hermione despite knowing that Rita was a lying piece of shit. Which, as Hermione's friend, would put her on Harry's shitlist either way.

- Wish fulfillment collections, be it money, titles, girls or mansions. Especially when it doesn't serve a reason beyond showing that Harry has a big dick and lots of cash.

- Slow burn. I'm simply not interested in reading 150k words while knowing that they will end up together but have to work their way through a shitton of arbitrary and completely unnecessary roadblocks.

- Canon pairings. I'm just not buying it.

* Pet "Yes":
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: pet-yes
  :END:

- Exploring background characters and making them more than whatever they do for the protagonist. Susan Bones is more than a tool for Harry to contact her aunt and get his tool wet. Someone else adopts Harry? They are still going to have a life beyond him.

- Acknowledging that both, the muggle and the magical world have strengths and weaknesses. It is remarkably difficult to shield against a sharpshooter, who is a mile away because you don't even know that he's there. But apparation certainly beats taking the train for six hours. Also, flying on brooms is probably the most fun you'll have with your pants on.

- Time travelers with adult morales. Someone, Harry in most cases, has lived through a war. He's not going to take shit from Snape, Malfoy or any other future or past Death Eater for the sake of preserving the time line. Those people had a hand in the deaths of his family and friends. Let's just say that Aragog will be getting a lot of fresh food. And yes, if killing a child (be it Riddle, Hitler or Malfoy) will save lives then no one is going to gamble with the chance of maybe redeeming them, because that puts others at risk.

- The "light" side fighting to win. No one would fight a war with non-lethal weapons. That's just throwing lives away.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

***** Ohh yeah I've read that one. Yeah that Harry is far too diverse to be normal. I liked the idea of his runes at first. But when he gets ALL ideas of the rune regarless of the magic intent of himself it felt less like any sacrifice was ever made. You could just copy Harry's runes and the process then. Since the master's idea of the rune doesn't matter.

Sex magic is hilarious to me I'd love a serious take on it than it devolving into nonsense. Like imagine Hermione giving a serious lecture on it to a class room.

** Pet Peeves

Familiar, Pet, or Animal full blown sentience. It irks me when this happens. If that is going to be a fully fledged character make one. Don't restrict them or have to grant them a new humam form before they are a fully developed one. Just because something can talk does not make it sentient.

Inconsistent characters, if your character is an arse then he's an arse. If he's ignorant than he is ignorant. Don't make a shut in genius, but also suave, but also cruel, but also a total arse but only to negative characters. Characters grow and develop. Give characters a temperament and stick with it, sure they can develop out of it. But not 180 back and forth at leasure. Demure Harry is great, beaten weak child it up. But him exploding at others and never at his friends makes him look odd in my eyes.

Occlusion of the mind (especially perfect occlusion), mean this character is powerful now... What? Why? Sure you can do this cool thing, but so what? I can lick my elbow, doesn't mean I can sprint faster now.

Wands are useless, no. If they were no one would use them. Maybe you don't "need" a wand. But it damn helps, just because the MC says "what if I don't use a wand?" doesn't mean suddenly it is all clear and magic is your bitch. Other creatures with magic want wands, if a dragon could use a wand forget about it.

Pet Delight

Magic, explained and used it ways that can be totally unique. Like trying to describe color to someone totally colorblind. Also just fun creative magic in general. Once it's ohh Magic has this many units to lift or burn. I just need more Mana. If it is just math then that sucks, math is less fun than magic.

Get the blood pumping, a solid action scene, well written Quiddich, actual tension in a courtroom, negotiation at wand point. Give me something. Even romantic tension between Harry and an over amorous pair of Crevery Brothers, (he doesn't want to hurt them but he's just not into that.)

Hedwig, I don't know why but I love stories with a visible Hedwig. Harry is a pretty isolated kid, and we love our pets. He doesn't need to converse with her or anything, but she should have some kind of presence in the story if he got her at 11.

****** Okay so I read it, it was quite an interesting read physically. The way it's written and jumps through time is clear forwards and back, but always for ward for Romilda. It's also much shorter than I expected.

Still not a bad read, and as clearly obsessed she is there's a moment about, Slytherin but a Gryffindor, and vice versa that's pretty sweet.

Makes me want a longer more in depth view of this kind of constant time jumping.

You mean sapience/sapient. And having a /conversation/ with something (rather than just hearing it speak/mimic) /does/ require sapience, or at least a very strong self-awareness that most animals just don't have.

Not just animals either, like a sassy enchanted mirror could hold a simple conversation does that make it sapient to some small degree?

***** Here's a question, then. Does using Parseltongue make the snake you speak to self-aware, or are all snakes sapient?

My personal belief is that part of the magic is that /when you speak to any snake, that snake can speak back/. This means it must force self-awareness onto the snake if it didn't possess it previously. Temporarily, and perhaps with time, permanently.

It might also have some part-magic-part-reverence-part-debt that snakes follow the instructions of parselmouths.

****** Interesting, I like it. To me it was always the words you get in reply are simply your own magic attached to the snake. In a way subverting it's mind and instilling a primitive copy of your own on it. Reporting back the experience it has while attached to the snake like some sort of advanced monitoring spell.

Sort of infecting it with your magic as you speak parseltongue, casting a spell with your dialogue. Which is why if you taught another magical a word like "open" or "stop" it would work if they said it right. They are in essence casting the spell, but would have to come to a parseltongue for more words.

For permanent snake intelligence I suppose you would have created a magical creature at some point of magical saturation from talking to it again and again. And eventually it could develop a simple mind of its own. But in the end still be loyal too you as its creator. I mean the Basalisk only ever said a few words, and it was very old and had interacted with Slytherin for presumably a good while. Perhaps the effects worse off after hundreds of years
