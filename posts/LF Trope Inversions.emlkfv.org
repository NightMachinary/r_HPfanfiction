I'm looking for stories that take a common fanfiction trope applied in a unique way. Do you have a super!ron story? Maybe one where the mauraders travel to the modern era? A Dumbledore POV where his puppeteering /actually/ serves the greater good.

I don't know exactly what I'm looking for, but I'm hoping you do!


** Ron becomes a super hero in Speed; linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10305062/1/Speed]]) and is a super powerful time traveler with some memory problems in linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12141684/1/The-Red-Knight]])

In /Misplaced Moony/ [sic] on ao3, a teenage Mooney travels to the canon era.

That's the stuff you specifically asked for, so for interesting modifications on the standard tropes there's a few different takes on stuff. So rather than putting Harry in a different house, how about putting Tom Riddle in a different house? He makes for a very interesting Gryffindor in the There is nothing (to fear) series: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1087368]]

linkffn(Anticlockwise) is a time travel fic from the POV of a non-traveler. This is one of my favorites, although incomplete.

linkffn(Far too many time travelers) Everybody /but/ Harry is a time traveler in this one.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12431454/1/What-Would-Broz-Do-A-Harry-Ron-Series-of-Events]]) Rather than Harry and Hermione leaving Ron out of the Golden Trio, Harry and Ron leave Hermione out, causing some interesting changes.

When time travel stories have characters who time travel on purpose, they generally do so because they're trying to save the world or someone they care about. Romilda Vane is using time travel just to make sure that /she's/ the girl who ends up with Harry. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12407725/1/A-Question-of-When]])

  It's been said that little things can change the world, and they can. But then, so can big things. This is the story of the big things that happen when Ron Weasley meets his mother's cousin, the Accountant they don't talk about. Ron learned that there is more to life than magic. Sometimes a skill gained by accident is all you really need to change the world.

  When Ron Weasley realized he was reborn to the world with his memories mostly intact, he felt it was a second chance to do better. However, he slowly realizes that this world was different from his own. Making new friends and earning new enemies, he has to use his experience from his previous life not only to reach his goals, but also to survive. AU

  Young Tom Riddle watches Dumbledore set his wardrobe on fire and thinks it's the coolest thing ever. From that point on, Tom only wishes to become a man as great as his Professor. Dumbledore really, really doesn't know how to deal with the little psycho kid following him around. Series of short drabbles and snippets into the life of Tom Riddle, star pupil, future Transfigurations master, and president of the Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore Fan Club (the APWBDFC, for short).

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.

  Salazar Slytherin has had enough of Dumbledore and Voldemort's stupidity, so on October 31, 1981 he decides to put a stop to the wizarding war. Things do not go according to plan. He loses his memories, but 10 years later he regains them when he gets a familiar letter. Bashing of some characters at first, but it gets better. A twist to the Harry is Salazar genre.

#+begin_quote
  Trope inversion
#+end_quote

A common trope I see in young Voldemort/Tom Riddle-centric fics is him being a monumentally abrasive and impatient authoritarian towards his followers. A lot of them become absurd imo, where he, as a young teenager, throws around the Cruciatus curse at anyone who slightly annoys him. In short, fanon TMR is often all stick no carrot. I aim to address this issue in my fic; he'll still be displeased with incompetent lackeys for sure, but I've depicted the way he charms and recruits his followers, often by playing on their insecurities but in a suave rather than coercive way.

** Alright:

- linkffn(Contractual Invalidation;The Amalgamation Agreement): pretty much subverts a lot of the Ice Princess DG, white knight Harry, marraige contract, and noble idiot Harry tropes popular to the genres
- linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is a Dish Best Served Raw): right off the bat we get the fact that Harry is the /second/ time-traveler sent back, and indeed that his terrible experience in life was a result of the other time traveler (aka his brother the "BWL"). Several others come up over time.
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin): lots of examples (in theory at least) but a prominent one is that their are legitimate reasons why wizards/witches are absolutely terrified of werewolves.
- linkffn(The Lesser Sadness): the only noteworthy example of a time-traveler being sent back for less than good purposes, among other things. This fic oozes personality and I highly recommend, especially for the action scenes.
- linkffn(On the Way to Greatness): unlike every other Slytherin!Harry fic, when he ends up there its absolutely miserable for him. It is traumatic and far more brutal than being in Gryffindor, yet feels more canon than almost any other similar fic in the genre.
- linkffn(The Firebird's Son: Book 1 of the Firebird Trilogy): features an absolutely horrible (read: undesirable) scenario where harems are not only accepted but forced on males, and that its actually more like vampirism than anything. Dark but a truly magnificent scope.
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy-Who-Lived): you've probably read this one, but the obvious example is Harry doesn't become dark because he is neglected or abused in respect to his twin. He just wants power and knowledge.
- linkffn(A Mother in Law's Love): features a mostly comedic take on several tropes - such as time-travel, nice goblins, rich Harry, and soul-bonds - that throws quite a bit of shade at the popular ideas of the genre(s).
- linkffn(Equal and Opposite): instead of a dark love-interest being turned good by the MC's kindness/goodness/etc., the MC is corrupted to the dark side. And when Harry goes dark here, its all the way.
- linkffn(Realignment): among other things, time-traveler that goes back to kill Tom Riddle in Hogwarts sticks to that overall goal from beginning to end, nearly succeeding on several occasions.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19312162/chapters/45935500][The Devil You Know]] is a comedy that subverts the most common tropes in other 'Harry talks to the horcrux in his head' fics, such as "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11762850/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Accidental-Horcrux][Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux]]" or "Hit the Ground Running" by Tozette.

Unlike most other fics of that kind: the two do not fall in love, Harry does not wallow in angst and do nothing when he knows the Chamber of Secrets is going to be opened, Tom is not the 1940s equivalent of 'Draco in leather pants' already lording over his improbably compliant Slytherin lackeys, and the opening of the Chamber of Secrets is not the central drama of the plot.

  All Harry Potter ever wanted was to finally be accepted as someone other than an incurably criminal boy. A fresh start in Slytherin - which, admittedly, does seem to have a worrying proportion of goons - seems to be just what he needs to make some lifelong friendships. And if that life happens to be an immortal one, all the better.It's too bad that the high-pitched voice in his head has other ideas.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
