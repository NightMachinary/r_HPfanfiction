  If pressed, later, she'd say it was exhaustion that caused her to forget who she was talking to, and it was that same exhaustion which prevented her from foreseeing the inevitable fall-out of telling James Potter, "Ugh, no thanks, I hate flying." / Lily/James, seventh year.

** LinkFFN(13230340) or [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/30508233/chapters/75237201][here]] on AO3.

A very pleasant story spanning all 7 years. It's complete except for the epilogue.

Edit: I specifically didn't write out a fanfiction bot command for the AO3 one because I felt like calling the bot twice for the same story was unnecessary. For some reason that disn't work.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13546950][Sharing is a Myth]] by XxTheDarkLordxX

Summary:

“Draco,” Harry breathed, stepping forward. “I have been in love with you since the moment you offered me your biscuit when we were five.” Draco snapped his head up, breath rattling in his chest. “What?” He himself hadn't realized his feelings till a few years ago. “Or maybe it was when you snuck out of your house when we were nine and you declared that you would use your inheritance to buy me the world.” Draco felt his ears heat up and he wished Harry would stop.

** Harry took a step closer. "Perhaps it was when I gave you my dirty old jacket and you smiled so beautifully that I slipped and fell."

Or Draco doesn't understand the concept of sharing, but sets out to learn. Sharing turns out to be far harder than he originally believed, but it can be rewarding if he just takes a chance.

THEY GROW UP TOGETHER AND ITS ADORABLE! Also Sirius and Remus are Harry's guardians :)
