** The only thing I can think of is linkffn(The Boy Who Could Not Die).

Its probably one of the most interesting takes on Horcrux!Harry out there, though it stopped in 2nd year.

  At seven, Harry stumbles out of the car crash that killed his uncle despite the fact he should be dead. It is at this moment that he discovers that, unless a very specific weapon is used, he cannot suffer injury, he cannot feel pain, and he cannot die. Harry proceeds to abuse the hell out of this. A lot. Black comedy, dark, some bloody scenes, Harry/Ginny eventually

***** On a slightly different note, if you want Harry with an innate problem, you might also try linkffn(Blindness). An interesting idea, though it slowly becomes a bit unbelievable.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** So my nephew has no feelings of pain and I feel as if someone in the magical world had this they would be a serious threat to themselves and others. Imagine having to explain why a pain curse is bad on someone who has no concept of what pain is.
