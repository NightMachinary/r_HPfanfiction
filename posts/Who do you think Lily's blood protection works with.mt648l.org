The story says it has to be someone with Lily's blood, right? Do you think a half-sibling (of Lily's) would work? Her parents? Her aunts/uncles? If it works off DNA, it shouldn't work with Petunia, but it only says blood. How far back could it go?

This is probably mostly speculation, but I'm curious what other people think.

  "Harry, I have devised a most ingenious way to allow you to leave the Dursleys," Dumbledore said.

  Harry perked up. "Really? What?"

  "As you know, so long as you consider a place where your mother's blood dwells your home, the charm I placed on you will hold and Voldemort will be unable to harm you. That's why I have decided that you should spend your summer with Voldemort himself."

  Harry stared at Dumbledore. "What?"

  "Don't you see?" Dumbledore said excitedly. "He took your blood, your mother's blood! Voldemort himself will satisfy the conditions of the Charm. So long as you live with him, he cannot harm you!"

*** This seems like the crap I could see in one of those "comedy" fics written by twelve year olds.

** Honestly with how fics work I don't think you should limit yourself. Construct your narrative and if you can't find a suitable backstory just rewrite the blood protection. It's vague enough as it is.

You can turn it around to be: people who love Harry, people who Lily considered family, pretty much anyone. And you can for the same reasons dismiss the wards and say they don't exist (since Lily didn't consider Petunia family etc.)

** Magic works in an esoteric ways, so I find it best to not try to bring "science" into it. Because if you do, it could start to bring other questions like"someone who received a blood transfusion technically share blood with the donor (at least for a while), so couldn't Harry or Petunia just gives blood to a potential guardian so Harry could live in his House?".

Personally, I think that Harry's blood protection would only work with Petunia, not necessarly because she is the only one with a blood that "fits", but because Dumbledore made it that way. When he used Lily "love protection" to create another one around a location, Lily (apparently) only had a sister and a nephew left, and Dudley was not only a child but didn't really have a home (he technically lived with his parents). So Dumbledore used the only person available and the Protection can't be changed once cast.

If we add to guess about a situation where Dumbledore has plenty of choice, I think I would make it so the Protection only work with direct relatives (if only to not make it too complicate from a narrative point of view). So Lily's parents, siblings and children (and maybe Aunts, Uncles, Nephews and Nieces though I'm not convinced about it).

** Petunia or Dudley should be the only options. I've seen where Petunia can't handle things and leaves. Dumbledore comes by and adjusts the wards to work via Dudley.

I would be open to ðŸ™ˆ me crackfics where magic considers Britain or Earth 'home', rendering Harry functionally untouchable by Voldemort.

** Also considering Harry has to stay with someone who has Lily's blood does that mean he could live anywhere and have those protections, considering Harry already has Lily's blood already running through is veins why would he need someone else?
