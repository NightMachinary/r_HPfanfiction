I mean, it was hit by Fred and George's bewitched snowballs. Like a sticking charm or something? Because it kind of surprises me that in no time travel or similar fics anyone ever thought to just, in secret, accio the turban or something to expose him.

*** I'm quite aware of that, but Quirrell collapsed on the ground and it didn't move an inch from his head. He also had charmed snowballs hitting it and nothing happened to it.

** Sticking charm. Also, was Voldemort actually in the back of his head in a visible way? Or was that just a way to get a face?

*** I expect the face wasn't there all the time but that there would have been a suspicious weird hairless growth with protofacial features half-formed.

*** But how could he remove it just like that when confronted by Harry? Did it just conveniently wear off then? Because there never was a mention of him cancelling the spell or anything before unwrapping the turban. Idk, that whole turban business is kind of sketchy.

As for your question: who knows? üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

**** Charm programming: the turban will only unravel by the hand of the wizard wearing it.
