Edit: Okay, I don't want this thread to only end up being an inane discussion about how likely the prompt is in canon, so I'll throw in some of my thoughts...

I'll /start/ with the premise of the prompt, that Lupin *recognises Scabbers as Pettigrew*.

Firstly, it would depend on whether he reacts calmly or emotionally. Either way, the moment Pettigrew realizes that the game is up, he'll try to run. So Lupin will have to both capture the rat and explain things to Harry, Ron and Hermione because I don't think the trio will react well if anyone, even if it's a professor, draws a wand on them.

Now, if this happens before the dementor turns up in the compartment and the rat makes a run for it in the confusion...

(Everything being tied up neatly is boring IMO)

Cue a train wide rat-hunt before the Hogwarts Express stops and Pettigrew can escape or take a hostage. All this, while not even Lupin knows what happened on Halloween 1981 and rest don't even know that.

This is one idea. I'm sure that people can come up with more.

*** Yeah, that's what's likeliest to happen. But there's always a possibility that since he was listening to Harry talk, plus the whole Sirius escaping thing, he might me thinking of memories of times gone by, and his childhood at hogwarts, effectively "priming" his brain to instinctively recognize wormtail, if he opened his eyes.

After that it would only take to him realizing, wait, this rat that looks a lot like Peter is missing a toe, wait, all that was left of Peter was a finger, wait -

The jump is a pretty easy one to make, he would just have to be mentally open to it.

I mean.. maybe I'm just faceblind for rats, but I can genuinely not tell the two rats apart a friend of me has, and they are probably a lot more cuddly and more around than Peter in his animagus form ever was. - Also you can't really tell how many little toes they have or are missing, it's all so tiny and permanently in motion.

You can of course make Remus realize it is Peter all along in a story, but if you wanted to make that a realistic chance, you'd have to give him some /super/ distinct fur markings. Which you absolutely can, since animagus forms seems to copy glasses and stuff.

***** I guess im thinking that it's less that Remus is able to legitimately tell wormtail is wormtail and more like...

You know that feeling when you've been thinking of your friend Sally recently, who you haven't seen in a while, and then suddenly you see the back of someone who looks a little bit like her, blonde and tall, and your brain immediately goes "holy shit it's Sally!" And then you get a closer look, and realize that the hair is more wheaty than gold, and she just seemed tall because she was wearing heels, and it's not Sally after all. But sometimes we do "mistakenly" recognize people for a split second, just because they're on our mind.

So I'm suggesting perhaps Remus was dreaming of his younger years, and saw a fat brown rat, and for a split second mistakenly thought the rat was wormtail. Of course he laughs it off, it's ridiculous. But then he takes a closer look, and starts to see more similarities. Nothing immediately identifiable, but enough that there is a tiny growing suspicion, enough that he starts actively looking for proof, if only to prove that he's wrong, that he's just growing paranoid like mad-eye. He starts deliberately counting toes, reasoning that it's a sure way to prove his mad suspicions wrong, after all, if Pettigrew were alive he'd have a missing toe. And then of course he notices the missing toe, and all bets are off.

We know he's able to make that absurd leap of logic because he already did it. In canon, basically the second he saw Pettigrew's name on the map, he instantly figured out the entire story with no further proof, and was 100% on Sirius' side by the time he made it to the shack. All he need to the solve it was proof that Peter was alive. And if he had even the barest suspicion of Ron's rat, that would be enough to make him figure it out.

I agree with you that it is very hard in real live. You have to be around animals really often to tell them apart. My family and my neighbour used to have two cats with the same fur markings and it took me ages to tell them apart.

But it is a fantasy novel - and Sirius could tell it was Peter by looking at a picture he saw for seconds when the minister was there. So there has to be something that makes him unique besides the missing toe. That means it could be possible that Remus can tell it's Wormtail.

******* To be fair, I think the reader is supposed to interpret that he immediately recognized Peter, and it's also not like Azkaban had great lighting? It would still be an major jump from "peter is alive" to "this tiny picture of a blurry tiny rat in shit lighting absolutely 100% Peter" and Sirius was able to accomplish it. Even if he is mad, I'm sure that he wouldn't assume any random rat in the news was Peter.

And if Sirius was able to objectively recognize Peter from a shitty newspaper, there's no reason Remus wouldn't be able to at least realize the rat 3 feet from his face looks /startlingly/ similar to wormtail, which should be enough to tip off his suspicion.

*** Idk, because you wouldn't say this if Pettigrew was a cat or a dog, as you are (probably) more familiar with them and are aware that each is unique.

So, like a shepherd could tell apart each of his sheep and recognise them, I think that Lupin would recognise Pettigrew because he knows him so intimately.

My dog just died (don't say anything, please) and if I actually saw him on the street I would be shocked but it would be impossible for me to not recognise him. I'm having a hard time explaining my point... It's like... Seeing someone that looks like your friend (it'll make you think about them) and actually seeing your friend (you'd never mistake them).

I only have a problem with this, not the rest of what you said. The rest is /totally/ on board. Sure, there's no rule against discussing it but I find it patently stupid to argue a /fanfiction/ prompt's likelihood in /canon/.

It simply /doesn't matter/. A prompt has been stated. /Build upon it./

And I'm saying this because every thread where canon likelihood is mentioned, ends up discussing canon rather than any good ideas about how the prompt could be brought about and how and what would happen from it.

And it's absurd to find a response like "Lupin wouldn't recognise him" when the prompt is /plainly stating/ "Lupin recognises Scabbers as Pettigrew".

Hence "need to check the books". If Scabbers is ever in the presence of Remus, and remus saw him but ignore him in canon, then we go from that scene, and then divert from canon, following your prompt.

If it never happened, then we create a new scene in the train ride, and we divert from canon from there.

** How about Peter recognizes Lupin on the train and schemes to create an ally.

Lupin sees a rat squeezing and waving to him and slowly starts to see that this is actually Peter in Wormtail form.

Lupin performs the reversal spell and Peter starts this elaborate tale of the duel with Sirius that ended with Sirius casting a cutting curse and a blasting curse at him. Always the weaker wizard, he tried to flee as Wormtail but lost a finger and the blasting curse hit a gas line causing an explosion.

When he woke up, he was still in rat form, bleeding from the head, and as much as he tried, he couldn't change back. Caught in a sewage pipe, slowly dying, he was washed out of London and somehow ended up in Ottery St Catchpole. There, Percy Weasley found him and nursed him back to health. He tried to signal and communicate that he was a wizard for months with Percy just thinking he was a really excited and smart rat. He tried escaping but could never make it far as a rat.

When that failed, he resigned himself to just live his life as a comfortable pet with the Weasley family.

When he saw the news of Sirius escaping, he started panicking, and Hermione's cat just made it worse.

*** Poor Sirius but I actually think it would work.

I mean: in this story Peter has a reason why he stayed a rat - and one that would be more believable than going into hiding out of fear that somebody could break out of an prison like Azkaban. Peter was never the most capable wizard between the marauders so him being unable to turn is something that Remus might very likely believe - especially because everybody still believe that Sirius was the Secret Keeper. As long as he doesn't something stupid like reveling his dark mark - of which I am not sure he got it before finding Voldemort - he might got away with it.

** alright i personally think that if Remus's character was a hair stronger (steadfast and moral) that he would have recognized first the smell (being so close to the full moon as in cannon he should have had a heightened sense of smell being one reason, and the other being that rats pee and poop constantly with no bowel or bladder control at all meaning that little rat was leaving smell of little rat all over the magically cleaned train as a second reason).

The only reason i can determine (going off cannon) that Remus didn't recognize Rat Peter was because Remus had become so apathetic that he like most magicals were willfully gullible and willing to go with the general flow of of the loudest voice.

Remus character has the Martyr-Be-Me syndrome down to an art form as is seen from the scene in the latter books when he tries to 'help Harry' after they left school to search for the Horcrux. in reality he was trying to be the martyr and escape the responsibility, which ironically is likely why he didn't consciously recognize peter on the train, he had already subconsciously formed the mental pattern.

At least that is my opinion, i prefer the Remus Lupin in several fanfics who either was too 'ill' to make the effort to be aware of his surroundings or too focused on the scent of his 'cub', he's a bit more moral and standup then the image JKR portrays.

** I can't remember what exactly happened in the books. My copies are at my parents' house and I'm too lazy to search the internet for the relevant chapter. Anyway, here's my attempt to write something:

@@@

Remus blinked open an eye to see who was joining him in the train compartment and caught a glimpse of a rat poking its head out of a red headed boy's pockets. He immediately pretended to be asleep again. That split second greatly disturbed him and although he was very tired, he couldn't go back to sleep, which was a pity--he had really been looking forward to sleeping on the train. He just knew that that rat was Peter. But he rationalized that it couldn't be. His mind was playing tricks on him. Peter was dead. There were many rats out there and this one just looked like Peter. After all, it wasn't as if Peter had any distinctive marks on his Animagus form... and then this trail of thought was broken. Remus was forced to recall things that he wanted to forget: James, Sirius and Peter learning how to be Animagi so that they could help him with what they dubbed as his "furry little problem," the four of them seeing and sensing each other transform so many times that they could just tell. It was weird but it was magic and magic didn't have any logic.

Remus was startled out of his reverie when he realized that one of the boys who had entered the compartment was none other than Harry Potter, James and Lily's son. And he was telling his friends, the redhead and a girl, about a warning he received from his friend's father to not go looking for Sirius Black. Fate must be punishing Remus for his past inaction to become part of young Harry's life so it decided to dump all of these things on him on the day he returned to where it all began, Hogwarts. And so Remus started to plot. As he pretended to sleep, he thought of how he could get the red headed boy, who he later learned was named Ron, to hand over the rat to him for a quick examination, just to make sure it wasn't Peter. And if it was, he had to get to the bottom of what he suspected was going to be a convoluted story.

The opportunity presented itself when Ron took "Scabbers" out of his pocket to give it its scheduled dose of rat tonic. The girl, Hermione was her name, gave a shout of "Crookshanks, no!" and there was a scuffle. Remus, still pretending to be asleep, guessed that the girl's pet cat was trying to catch and toy with the rat. He wondered a bit why these students didn't keep their pets in cages since cats and rats rarely got along. Well, now would be a good time to "wake up."

@@@

I got that far before running out of steam. Next scene would be Lupin waking up and immediately conjuring very secure pet carriers around Scabbers and Crookshanks so they wouldn't escape. Hermione wanted to protest that she had a basket but she didn't want to argue with a teacher who was possibly angry because they had disturbed his nap. Lupin secretly put more charms on Scabbers' cage after confirming that it really was Peter. He didn't make any indication that he recognized the rat, though, because he was still trying to sort through his thoughts. The number one thing that he had in mind was to talk to Dumbledore. He would come clean about the Animagus transformations of his friends for Harry's safety and together with the Headmaster, get the story out of Peter, because why the heck didn't he let Lupin know that he was alive all these years? Mind made up, Lupin then introduces himself as the new DADA professor, helps Ron make Scabbers take the rat tonic by sedating the frantic pet, then excuses himself from the compartment to send an owl to Dumbledore requesting for a meeting ASAP once they're at Hogwarts. I am making up the detail that there must be a school owl stationed inside the train for the Head Boy and Girl or prefect to be able to send messages to the school just in case trouble arises. Lupin knows about this because he was a prefect before.
