I was wondering if there are any stories where Severus Snape didn't exist or is a muggle and so has no impact on the Wizarding world.

Thanks in advance!!


** I know of a fic (it was sirius centric) where Snape does exist, but he doesn't do anything. Like he's not a part of the war /at all./

**** It's this - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29236707][and he smiled (with a mouthful of bloody teeth)]]. Snape plays little to no role in this, though, but it starts from the Prank in their fifth year.

** I always figured such a universe would be worse off, because it would result in a rather important cog missing in the chain of events that led to Voldemort's first downfall. It wasn't exactly to Snape's credit, more the opposite, but he /did/ inadvertly set things in motion for this to happen. My headcanon is that without a BWL, Voldemort ultimately wins the war. I think he would eventually be defeated after ICW intervention after he inevitably tries to expand beyond Britain, but Wizarding Britain would basically be in ruins in the aftermath.

I actually have a idea for a fic of my own that would cause this outcome, except that in the fic, Snape actually never becomes a Death Eater -- and Wizarding Britain is worse for it, for similar reasons.

** First Voldemort war would probably be lost if that happened. Because the attack on Halloween wouldn't happen so Voldemort would have that decade of being dead. Not sure how the prophecy would play out though.

** I once saw a fanfic, quite interestingly examining the consequences of the absence of Snape. (This was a slash fanfic in which Harry wishes Snape never existed.) Harry became a werewolf (there was no one to save him from Lupine). Even the simplest potions are very expensive because very few wizards can brew them. Some potions do not exist (there was no one to invent them). The prophecy was still delivered to Voldemort (Pettigrew heard it from Sirius), but the Potters were not aware of the danger. Sirius was not in Azkaban, but he considers Harry the cause of his friend's death and hates his godson. The Order of the Phoenix is â€‹â€‹much less effective without a spy. The Slytherin locket is still in the cave. Dumbledore destroyed the ring and died immediately, the Order does not know about the Horcruxes.

(sorry for possible mistakes, I use google translate)

**** Attention! This is a slash fanfic Snape / Potter. This is fanfic for Snape fans (because he's absolutely good and Dumbledore and the Maraders are bad). It's in Russian (I hope google translation Russian-English is as good as English-Russian). Fanfiction is not finished, but is regularly updated.
