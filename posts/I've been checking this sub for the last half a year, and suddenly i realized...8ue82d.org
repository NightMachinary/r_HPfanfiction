#+begin_quote
  First part of the complete HDH trilogy. Post GoF. A tale about a captivity which brings two unlikely persons closer - much closer. Not a slash story. Currently re-edited.

** I've mentioned it when someone requested Snape and Harry fics a while back. It's a series of three stories, it's really good, if you're in the mood to do a bit of philosophizing and deal with a ton of angst. Sometimes you need lighter stuff but it is well written

*** I also like the name Quietus, it was the first story I read where Snape had a brother and that brother was Harry's father. It is/was a new concept to me. A better take than most Snape-Adopts-Harry or Severitus'
