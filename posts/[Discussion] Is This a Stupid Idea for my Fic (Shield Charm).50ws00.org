So, I'm writing a fic that is mainly focused on the idea of learning magic. In canon, there are massive books dedicated to a single spell. There's also no such thing as "high level" versions of spells. For instance, there isn't a stronger version of the Shield Charm that only elites use. We also see great variation in skill and "power", especially in regards to Voldemort and Dumbledore.

In my story, I've been setting up the idea that "mastering" a spell allows an individual to improvise and "stretch" the magic. For instance, an average wizard might be able to use 'Incendio' to create several fireballs, but a person like Dumbledore could create massive waves of fire, or shape them into weapons, etc.

The idea is that there isn't a "Shoot fire shaped like an arrow" or "Shoot three fireballs at once" spell, instead, great wizards like Voldemort or Dumbledore can take spells and improvise their magic to deal with the changing situation. However this requires both experience and experimentation. Practicing 'Incendio' over and over would certainly help, but Harry would also have to experiment and understand theories behind the "elements" to improve. Basically, lots of studying and practicing.

Now, in my story, Harry is learning the Shield Charm, and at first he sucks at it, but soon he finds that he can defend against one or two of his opponents spells at the same time, and he thinks he's a hotshot. That is, until he sees Dumbledore fighting over a dozen Death Eaters. All of them simultaneously casting Dark Magic and offensive spells, and yet Dumbledore easily shields himself. Despite the constant barrage of spells, Dumbledore's shield doesn't waver.

Long story short, Harry is amazed, asked Dumbledore about it, and Dumbledore tells him that his experience and knowledge of curses and Dark Magic in general allows him to better defend against them.

The idea is that the Shield Charm becomes more effective when you are more knowledgeable of the incoming spell. Harry's experience with 'Stupify' and 'Expelliarmus' makes it easier for him to defend against those two, but his inexperience with Dark Magic makes them difficult for him to safely shield against. On the other hand, a person like Snape would have an easier time shielding himself from a spell like 'Sectumsempra' since he created it (and probably cast it numerous times), in addition to other Dark Magic.

Basically, a person's experience with specific magic allows them to better Shield themselves. Their Shield Charm will 'adapt' to the incoming spells, dispelling them more easily. So, is this a completely idiotic idea, or does it have merit?


** I think the idea seems fine, logical, and canonically plausible. It's good for you as the writer to know the details, but I wouldn't try and insert all that exposition into a story (if that's what you were thinking of doing). It's hard to see how it would drive a plot and too much telling can really slow a narrative.

** In broad terms, this is basically the interpretation of canon magic I use, as in, mastering a spell allows a wizard to do some things with it that you don't normally see. It's actually supported by canon. In OotP, Voldemort conjures a silver shield. I believe this is the standard Shield Charm, which Voldemort can manipulate to manifest as this silver shield.

#+end_quote

I think we may have discussed this before, but I always read this as a physical conjuration of a literal physical shield made of silver.

After the spell hits, Voldemort expresses surprise that it was not the Killing Curse, which indicates that at the time he conjured the defence, he was expecting the Killing Curse. Which in turn implies that he would be using a physical not magical defence.

**** I interpret it as Voldemort using a Shield Charm with a level of mastery that allows him to literally conjure a physical shield. The end result is no different than if it was explicitly stated it was a conjuration, but the way in which this end result was achieved speaks to Voldemort's skill. I'm not implying that the physical shield is the ultimate version of the Shield Charm, just that this is something Voldemort can do with it. In the same vein, I believe Dumbledore's fire whip to be a manipulation of the Fire Charm.

***** Do you think such a shield would defend against the Killing Curse, though? It seems to me that if you're using the shield charm, your defence, however it manifests itself, is fundamentally magical in nature, and thus shouldn't defend against the Killing Curse. This is because though it manifests physically, it's still a conjuration Charm not a conjuration Transfiguration.

****** Actually, something you mentioned in your review of the CC play on DLP made me think about it a bit. You said that you liked the new time turner because it showed that the Wizarding world isn't stagnant, new magic can be created. Voldemort has shown with his flight spell that he can do things no one else can. That's why I think it's not inconceivable that he could have invented a version of the Shield Charm that defends against the Killing Curse.

********* I don't believe so, no. Remember that Hermione was warned against changing the timeline and especially against meeting her past self.

The fact that such a thing had to be actively avoided, even though we know from the "first time" through the timeline that they didn't meet themselves, indicates that it is possible to change the timeline.

I think the PoA time travel situation is this: if you use the time turner "correctly" i.e. in accordance with good practice, then a closed loop is the result. That is safe time travel. But it is possible to use it badly and mess up the timeline.

The real change to the time travel mechanic in Cursed Child (other than the increased range) was that you don't have to live your way back to the present but rather the time turner is capable of taking you forward in time back to your present.

*********** The following is stated with the intent not to continue an argument but rather to flesh out my ideas.

My principal objection to an innovation allowing defence against the killing curse is thematic. The unblockability of the Killing Curse formed the basis of the entire HP storyline and was the principal factor in Harry's specialness. To have a block be discovered is to undermine the basis of the story.

Furthermore, the unblockability of the killing curse to me clearly represents the inevitability of death. If spells are magical representations of concepts, then the concept represented by the Killing Curse is death. Not only would a block undermine the theme of accepting death, I feel like the reason why a magical defence can never be made is because it is impossible to avoid death. Even the universe itself will one day "die".

I think wizards have as good a chance of discovering a block to the Killing Curse as Muggles have a chance of breaking the second law of thermodynamics.

************ Thematically speaking, I find Voldemort inventing a way to block the Killing Curse fitting for him. For Voldemort, the KC isn't as final as for someone else anyway. I feel like he doesn't get credit for surviving a direct hit. Sure, Harry wasn't reduced to a wraith thanks to love magic, but Voldemort survived the KC all the same.

This is more fanfic-specific than general headcanon. It's an interpretation that's useful for the fanfic I'm writing. I take a flexible approach to canon.

** This is pretty much exactly the interpretation of canon I use in all my fics, which I argue for in detail (with canon evidence) in the following document:

[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VOF1eu_B7qpTeTUykW5ZGK2HJmVAG5WouY71a5AiRPo/edit?usp=sharing]]

The section to look at is "Nature of Spells". It sounds like you'd be interested in the rest of the document though, as it provides a broader magical structure in which this theory of spells can be embedded.

** From someone who has no experience in reading fanfictions in this genre, I think it's interesting. Would a wands experience also allow them to better equip themselves? Such as a wand used to cast dark magic can defend against it better?

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Don't get too hung up on that. It is canon that there is "Incendio" and the /Fiendfyre/ spell (how the latter is cast, I do not know).

It is canon that there are definite differences between these two spells despite them both conjuring flames. /Fiendfyre/ destroys to a much greater extent than /Incendio/, there is something integral to /Fiendfyre/ that eclipses the lesser spell in its destructivity. I do not know how this is done, however certain fanfics have fiendfyre being an almost sentient manifestation of magical flames that is out-of-control from the moment it is conjured and that the caster of the magic must "reign-in" control of the spell to make it obey their requirements.

Through this comparison we can suppose that there /are/ spells which are inherently more powerful than other spells that perform similar effects. In this vein we can presume this is not limited to magically conjured flame and can extend to magical shielding with little further explanation needed. It doesn't need to be "Protego Maxima". A relatively easy way to introduce the /concept/ of higher-level spells would be to write something like:

Addendum: Got a bit carried away. This is quite an interesting topic to write about. I carried on writing this really to just persuade you to be a little creative with your world/magic-building. Let us call the following my /library oneshot/.

--------------

As soon as Harry awoke the Saturday following his talk with Dumbledore he made his way to the library. He held a written pass from Dumbledore himself in hand and gave it to the Madam Pince, she looked at Dumbledore's loopy signature sceptically while he stood waiting. However much she didn't want to she was duty-bound and relented, nodding him towards the Restricted Section with a harsh warning of keeping quiet /lest he tempt fate./

She was definitely no Voldemort but he'd rather not upset her. He shuffled past her and into through the metal gating into the restricted section. Fortunately there was no one else there and he quickly found the Defence Against the Dark Arts shelves, keen to learn the more powerful protective magic that Dumbledore alluded to. He'd noted down everything he could remember Dumbledore saying when he had returned to his room that night; Protective charms like Protego were just the start of the journey, Dumbledore had said. "A simple spell of singular utility, widely adaptable and malleable with practice."

To possess the skills he wanted, no - /needed/ - to develop, Harry would need to dig deep and understand how protective magics work on the /conceptual/ level - no easy feat. He browsed the old tomes on their dark wooden shelves contemplatively. Where was best to start ... Harry huffed before pulling a small, well-worn book from a lower shelf, /Thicker than Blood: The Magic Within./ He found a comforable looking chair and, unfamiliarly, found himself quite looking forward to furthering his knowledge; this wasn't about making teacups dance, this was about /life and death/ for him, preferably the former.

--------------

Harry found his eyes wandering to the clock on the wall, he'd silenced it ten minutes into his study session as it was impossibly distracting. To his surprise he'd found that four hours had passed since he'd last got up, when he needed parchment for notes. He had almost thirty inches of material from this one small book, almost all of the notes were perspective-changing and left him in awe of magic more completely than could ever remember being. Was this what Hermione felt like when she read her books? He looked at the shelves surrounding him with undisguised glee.

There was so much more to the field of defensive magic than he imagined. He could barely scarcely believe that hundreds of years ago people crafted charms that brought entirely new /concepts/ of magic to the fore, and defined myriad methodologies to casting them for every scenario you could possibly think of. Their ideas were so powerful and /true/ that they are still used today. No one had invented anything that surpassed them yet.

Harry read through his notes again. Some of his writing was so cryptic he had to go to each page he referenced to cement his understand of what he was waffling about.

/Learn to make spells more compact - more difficult to block - pg 36/

/BLOOD IS MAGIC - YOU ARE MAGIC - pg 146/

And underneath that: /MUM IS A GENIUS!!! DO HER PROUD!/

--------------

He still had forty or fifty pages left of /The Magic Within/ and had finished it not forty minutes later. There was nothing truly impressive in the latter end of the book, though it tied together a few ideas it had been shifting around since the start. Charms that create shields around you aren't very different from the manifest shape of the Patronus charm. One could, theoretically, explode out their Patronus to form a sphere around them... it was a tantalizing prospect and warranted practical experiment.

He did get a rush out of one line in the book. /The Patronus casting, while admirable to know in itself, is impractical as only well-developed mages can give it form enough to repel volumes of foes, more practical spells would be.../

Harry had almost laughed when he'd read that. In his third year he repelled hundreds of dementors to stop them from devouring Sirius's soul! If that didn't count as "volumes of foes" he didn't know what would. He had to try learning these "more practical spells" and see if they were any easier to learn, if he could cast a Patronus he had a good chance of getting the hang of the others. He had a list of almost a dozen he would try to cast by the days' end if he could manage it.

--------------

It had been a month since that first library visit and Harry was hooked on learning - more avid than Hermione, even. Why wouldn't he be?

He'd been back to the restricted section six times since that first visit. He need a new pass from a teacher each time and had discovered that if your help a professor with something, such as helping to tutor a first-year lesson on your free time, then you could get the pass as a form of reward. Part of him wished he'd gotten the Prefect's badge over Ron because that would let him access the Restricted Section at his leisure.

He'd learned so much in the last month - more than he could believe. He thanked the gods that seemed to watch over him for his twin-wand. He was certain that without it he'd be dead many times over. Voldemort had much more experience than him with this sort of thing but he was determined to close the gap. He just needed to take it day-by-day and layer advanced concepts ontop of simpler concepts. Eventually, with practice, he'd get there.

--------------

--------------

Once you've finished educating the reader on the "limits" and general concepts of magic, you can get away with saying:

/A scythe of deep-red exploded from Voldemort's wand with a thunderclap. From the moment of it's casting Harry had paled, then thrust his wand out, a split second later Voldemort's black magic fragmented and blew apart in angry sparks./

Voldemort's eyes narrowed at the magic Harry had thrown out. He wasn't impressed, but he wasn't unimpressed either.

/"I see you've learned some tricks since last time," said Voldemort./
