** Honestly, I'm one of the people who looks at this very differently.

Voldemort is undoubtedly the most POWERFUL of the two men.

But I will always consider Grindlewald to be more DANGEROUS. Because there is ALOT more to danger than raw power. Grindlewald comes across as the kind of man who, given enough time, could convince you to willingly murder your own parents, not out of fear (like Voldemort), but because you truly believed what Grindlewald was telling you.

It's the difference between a Scalpel and a Sledge Hammer.

*** Exactly! Tom Riddle always struck me like it was some sort of mask that hid the real Voldemort beneath; his charisma is manufactured whereas with Grindelwald, he's just a genuinely charming person, and you /want/ to be friends with him. However, you like the idea of being close to Riddle, he seems too perfect to be real. I don't think the direct parallel between Fred and George is a coincidence, is all. Grindelwald has a personality other than power hungry.

**** Before FB, canon implied some ties to the Nazis (both were the big bad which fell in 45 after a big final battle) and the early bits we see in DH imply that he had a vision of dominance, of actually ruling rather than Voldemort's "I take over but then do nothing but an ethnic cleansing". "Hitler was Grindelwald's puppet" used to be a popular trope a few years ago. And if you are Hitler's puppetmaster, you are responsible for the whole WWII thing, which would make Grindelwald truly dangerous.

I was never really comfortable with that trope since as a German, we are taught early on how and why Hitler came to be and making him a wizard's puppet is revisionism at best and at its finest. But it was quite common when I started getting into HP fanfics.

** I concur. Voldemort truly was the most dangerous of the two. Grindelwald took over Europe, but could not invade Britain because of Dumbledore. Instead of choosing the easy path, Voldemort took over Britain, choosing the much harder path. Without a doubt, Voldemort was on the path to a much more dangerous world than Grindelwald was ever capable of.

** A big problem of Voldemort is that he isn't that scary at all compared to Grindelwald, especially if you take the movies where he appears into account.

Voldemort as we see him in the books and movie is kinda pathetic as a main villain to me :

- He struggled to counquer a signle country while using very very underhanded tactics and a liberal use of the most OP spell ever (seriously a "you die lol" spell that you and your follower spam at will VS the order of the Pheonix who doesn't is an incredible advantage), while Grindelwald became a threat to the whole Europe.

- He fails to kill a teenager much too often, and somehow never thought of circumvating the priore incantatem problem by crushing harry with a big rock, making him sink into the ground or any creative use of magic.

- The magic he wields isn't that impressive except at the ministry honestly, whereas we saw Grindelwald do incredibly impressive spellwork.

- In his modern form he as absolutely no charisma, and most followers are here out of fear and not of devotion to his ideals.

â€‹

So yeah, overall he feels like a less impressive villain than Grindelwald, and than most villain from other work of fiction if I'm honest, so I can easily understand why people put the emphasis on good ol Grindelwald intead.

** Much is made of how powerful this or that is in a straight fight, a duel. But I would say tactical positioning is a lot more important, because regardless how good one guy is at blowing things up, one single killing curse hitting their unsuspecting back will still destroy their body.

That's typical villain overconfidence, Harry Potter also have that same thing with Voldemort, Isildur didn't defeat Sauron in typical duel but in tricky shot, that's what could be used as an example of being like real world and villain stupidity.

******** Except that a good player will ambush the "stronger" player and oneshot him with some x30 stealth crit since that's what their class is built for. Or snipe them from the other end of the map. Or out-circle them because they are more nimble and never be in a position where the stronger player can hit them.

Likewise in RTS. That big army of tanks will go down against a good recon jeep and a few guys with ATGMs. Or in GSGs, where you can easily defeat stronger enemies with proper use of terrain.

**** /Laughts in GoT/

Seriously though, even canon has Harry win despite being hopelessly outmatched in a fair fight. "The strongest always wins" might fit a cheap manga, but most fiction and most history does not have that conclusion (else the whole world would be pink).
