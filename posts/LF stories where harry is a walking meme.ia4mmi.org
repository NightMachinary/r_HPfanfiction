It's hard to find good (and completed) stories where harry is a walking, talking meme. Where he doesn't take anything seriously and acts like he has the front row seats to a stand up comedy.


** Not a fic, and I would assume the majority of people on here already know about it, but [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmwM_AKeMCk&list=PLC76BE906C9D83A3A][A Very Potter Musical]] by Starkid has Harry acting a bit like that (certainly more than in canon).

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

** Let's see there's linkffn(12350003) where Harry is a big ol' Weeb, as the title suggests. Has some hilarious moments, a lot of poking fun at how cringy Harry is being.

Then there's the linkffn(8400788) series, which is still ongoing. Basically Harry accidental magic takes him into the 40k universe, until he's banished back into his own... 200ish years later? But ends up during canon year 1/2. Great fun if you're at all familiar with the 40k universe.

My last rec is linkffn(6466185) where in Harry works incredibly hard to be as lazy as possible. Pretty great.

  Harry grows up watching anime and fantasizing about having superpowers. When his Hogwarts letter arrives, he jumps at the chance to live the life of a harem protagonist. Not a harem fic. Timeline moved forward to modern day.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

**** I know this one actually. I've read through the entire series. It's called inquisitor carrow by littlewhitecat.

Essentially harry is transported to the 40k universe. Becomes an astartes and an inquisitor and then thanks to an eldar wych (xeno scum) gets sent back to hogwarts. Hilarity and heresy ensues.

  The Wizarding World is devastated when Harry Potter disappears from his relatives' house in mysterious circumstances during the summer after his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Desperate to have their boy-hero back no matter what they really should have heeded the Muggle saying "be careful what you wish for". Crossover HP/WH40K.
