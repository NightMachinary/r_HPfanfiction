After the last chapters of Harry Potter and The Natural 20, and it's Fiona subplot, I was wondering if there is any fic with similar but bigger focus on a muggle POV theme, presented as a "mystery" story of some random person or group discovering the magic world on their own secretly, step by step.

If not specifically this plot, then what other good stories are there, focusing on a muggle POV, or interaction with muggles?


** This doesn't really fit what you're looking for, but [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]] by Marquis Black deals with the breaking of the Statutes of Secrecy.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

*** Thanks, that's a bit different from what I was thinking about but very interesting, I hope it stays regular.

** It's not from a muggle POV I'd like to recommend In Her Hands She Held the Whole World, by Sirenny, which is a one shot from Hermiones POV about the events surrounding the breaking of the secrecy during the war. It's quite short, but I thought it was a great piece of writing.\\

"The use of memory altering spells is common in the HP books. Protecting their secrecy comes before everything else, and justifies any action. Or so they believe."

This is a great story about a woman whose life gets upturned because of the Memory charms used by the DMLE to cover for a magical incident. Occurs pre-5th year but has very little to do with Harry and co.

*** Yes, thanks, that's the closest to what I was thinking about.
