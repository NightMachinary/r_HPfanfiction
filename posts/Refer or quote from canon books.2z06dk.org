** Having a (long) quote straight from the book (or literally copypasting parts for that matter) always breaks my immersion. It's not really frowned upon since it's legally allowed, but it's not like canon is sacred, just write it in your own words.

** References. I know what happened in canon; if someone starts quoting extensively I hit the back button or I skip until I see original writing again.

I don't mind a sentence or two at the beginning, if the story starts at a specific time in an event from the books. And if an author is retelling a certain scene but from a different perspective it's okay to quote - but it does take me out of immersion. I want to read something I haven't read before, not rehashing what I already know.

I love finding references though, like Remus having a chocolate stash or seeing a well known line of dialogue (like someone else mentioned, Draco's "Scared, Potter?").

** If they are rewrites / do-overs I don't really care for them. I know what happens in the books. But if they are character studies -for example, if you take the first book and explore Hermione's feelings leading up to the troll incident, it can be helpful to quote the scene in the Charm's class and Ron's comment after class.

** References. If you're give quote, no more than a sentence or so. But quoting does tend to distract me, so it's better to refer to events in your own way.

** Well, it depends on what assumptions you're willing to make about what parts of canon the reader remembers. It's safe to assume that /everybody/ remembers the sequence where a Hermione on the verge of tears pushes past Harry and Ron in first year--but is it safe to assume that everyone remembers Harry's date with Cho in fifth year with the same level of clarity? You'd want to quote the latter directly, but the former probably can be summarized more succinctly without any risk of annoying the reader.

** Refer please. As a reader, I absolutely hate reading scenes as they were written verbaitum from the book. I will actually skip ahead to where the original story comes back in. Honestly, if I wanted to read the book, I would just pick up the book.

However, what I don't mind, if there is a known phrase or something thrown in to the story at an appropriate non-canon spot. Examples could be creative uses of Draco's and Harry's banter of, "Scared, Potter?" "You wish," in stories that don't involve the duel in 2nd year or Snape saying, "Always," to someone in a poignant moment, etc. Those, I suppose, are creative uses for the book quotes that I don't mind so much.

** I would write it in your own words. The only time I like direct quotes from the book is if somebody is actually speaking.

** I'd rather not read a re-write, small quote or otherwise from canon. If you're gonna re-do a scene, change the perspective, change the lines, do something new so even if its just a re-hash, its got something different and /you/ about it.

** The whole 'read-along' books are often considered plagiarism/stealing copyrighted material when posted. These are basically posting large portions of JK's original work, books which you have to pay for to read for free. There is fair use (a few lines here and there, quotes, homage, parody) but quoting large sections of a copyrighted text and posting it publicly online, is not generally a good idea.

I know AO3 abuse asks users to edit out the large portions of text and mention a page number or summarize the block of text or they will delete the fic in question. I am not sure anyone knows the ways of FF.net and their deletions and removals, however the 'read-along' fics can be the one type that gets you in trouble and be serious.

Good luck.
