:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic where voldemort won and assigned each junior DE a spouse. The snakes had already predicted this and had each chosen an order member in advance that they would they to marry/rescue. They then flee the country. Hermione throws things at Draco, Ginny shags Blaise, and Luna does something properly weird with Theo, I'm sure.

Any idea what this one might be?


** It's been a while since I read it, but it sounds like "The Ones Who Ran" by colubrina.
