The next fic will be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8299839/1/Alexandra-Potter][Alexandra Potter]].

What did y'all think of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6057964/1/Sunny-Side-Up][Sunny Side Up]]?

^{I know a number of people disliked Indigo Autumn. I don't have time to read all the fics first to screen them and have to judge based on the recommendations and a skim of the first chapter, sorry.}


** Hoo boy. The characterization was pretty good... everything else was not. The romance was so unrealistic, and Mina was constantly angry about everything and for someone reason no one ever called her out on it. Like, her anger was supposed to be this tragic character flaw from her abusive past, but it never really got her into much trouble? And Sirius just randomly becomes infatuated with her after a timeskip? I could go on; needless to say, the only thing that I liked was how consistent the characters remained. Everything else was cliche or really unrealistic. :/ Mina really seemed like a Sue to me.

** I liked it a lot. The OC is a masterpiece, and the romance is rightly built. Honestly, I'm really sad knowing I'll probably never read the end of this story. But it certainly gave me a good time, so it's not that bad.

** I liked this one. It had some cringeworthy moments, especially at the beginning. It should probably be edited down about a third and I wish it was complete, but it was fun once it got rolling.
