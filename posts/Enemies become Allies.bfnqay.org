It doesnt necessary have to be Voldemort and his Deatheaters, as i imagined more a Threat that comes after his defeat. So they make an alliance because all of their Lives are in danger. I would accept Voldemort an allied enemy too, although it will be Paradox for me, as i think he would try to team up with the more dangerous ones. But as i said, i think about Dangers past his death. Hmm, now that i think about it, it doesnt have to be a whole Fraction of the Enemy, but possibly a single Person, who might survived the second War. AU is accepted, since there wasnt really serious Deatheaters who survived the War.


** Harry and Ginny started out as mortal enemies in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), and tried their best to kill each other on several occasions, but began working together when Voldemort became a serious threat again.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** Linkffn(Divided and Entwined) has the ministry forced to ally with Hermione's IRA-equivalent Muggleborn Resistance (who bombed quite a few pureblood manors) against Voldemort. After Voldemort's defeat, tensions rise again. Also, Daphne and Tracy become double agents.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief) has Harry, as an auror, helping the thieves he's supposed to hunt to rob Malfoy to reduce his influence in the government.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
