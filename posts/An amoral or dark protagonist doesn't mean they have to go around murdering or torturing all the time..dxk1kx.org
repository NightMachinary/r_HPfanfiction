I see this all the time in "DaRk!HaRrY" fics, where he just randomly murders someone (Tonks, or Ron, or whoever else) either for shock value or to show how eeeevil he is.

That's about the level of canon Voldemort, who is a mustache-twirling villain, not a convincing dark character. (seriously, you can't run an organisation by constantly torturing your officers and soldiers with a spell known to cause brain and nerve damage) Not to mention when it happens in "grey" fics, which are often /darker/ than those aforementioned "dark" ones.

It's like people look at his deeds, and then think that if the average "goodness" is neutral, it's grey, and if it's kinda evil, it's dark. That's not how it works.

An amoral or dark character acts much less like a rabid beast (notice how Greyback is used in most fics - as a weapon), but as a self-interested person only out for their own goals. The lengths they are willing to go to define if the character is dark, grey or light.

You can make a dark character with any motivation, too - a character doesn't meed to have ruling ambitions or destructive tendencies to be so. For instance, you could make a Dark!Ravenclaw!Harry who does not shy back from experimenting with integrating basilisk biology into his own, or researching phoenix immortality, even if it causes pain or death to said phoenix.

And lastly, a dark!character still needs to integrate into the story's world - They can't go around murdering indescriminantly with no consequences of any kind, or without reason.

***** Just please make it believable, so no teacher-student pairings, no deatheater-lightside pairings and stuff of that nature. They take me right out of the action, tbh.

Also, can you take it sloooow with the romance? A little fluff before the storm?

For instance, I can appreciate a good harry/other male student pairing (so long as the story isn't 90% smut, which can be a problem with any fic tbh), but harry/literal voldemort? nah. takes me right out.

Additionally... start when they're older? like, beyond fifth or sixth year? I'm not a real fan of preteen romances or pedophilia, you understand. Not to mention it makes a knowledgeable protagonist more believable.

Maybe the big bad had a setback and is hiding, so there's no pressure on a fourth year to go out and fight.

******* I will never understand Tomarry.

Lord Voldemort is an unredeemable character - that's how he was designed. He is a children's book antagonist grown into a young-adult book antagonist.

He is absolute, irredeemable, evil. In fact, involving him in a story like this would be detrimental.

He sees people in one of four cathegories:

one, unworth of life. Muggles, muggleborn, people who oppose him.

two, subservient. Those who take his mark.

three, a threat. Those equal or more powerful than him.

four, himself. the greatest of them all.

He's a populist that believes his own lies, a story-spinner that believes his own legend. He is also emotionless, about 70 years older than Harry, corrupted by the dark arts into an abomination and wants nothing but destruction.

You can either keep his character intact or stay faithful to my prompt, not both. It's not possible at face value.

But apart from that, the age difference and tonal dissinance is just too fucking jarring for me. No offense, but I dislike reading pedophilic pairings. or ones about literal snake satan dating an 18 year old.

Are you aware that there are more male characters beside draco and lord voldemort? many who would be much more interesting than either, too - a lightside character would provide some fun contrast. some near-oc character without a canon-personality would be a blank slate.

It's still a WIP, and Harry is re-sorted into Slytherin (not Ravenclaw) after he starts exploring the dark arts. Dark doesn't mean evil in my fic cuz it's just more interesting that way. :)

#+end_quote

Ah, the Murder Hobo character archetype.

Most these issues are tied up with authors who write a meta-story, where the protagonist doesn't act according to an internal motivation, but to some artificial meta-force or author-induced railroading. Book Harry wants a home with friends and family who loves him, to survive the school year, be the son his parents would be proud of. Your typical Fanfic "Dark Harry" is an edgelord with a justice boner who acts and exists only to "right the wrongs" of canon.

A true amoral character doesn't care about conventional definitions of right or wrong when they act. They also can't just pick and choose when to be amoral or not. You see this in badly-written stories where Dark Amoral Harry murders Death Eaters willy nilly, and then gets outraged when Draco steals Neville's Remembrall and tosses it on the roof.

I think the main problem stems from authors writing Harry's story like it's a role-playing campaign, instead of an established character within an established universe. Of course authors are going to write what appeals to them, but this winds up turning into a plot that doesn't follow any internal logic or consistency - only what the author wants to happen.

You can see this Deathly Hallows. JKR wanted to write a "Suffering Harry" by making him starve in the tent during the Horcrux Hunt, but made everyone forget about basic charms, invisibility cloaks, and muggle supermarkets to ramp up the SuFfErInG.

*** There's a difference between an actual amoral character and a character that just has different morals from the rest of the setting or the rest of our world. Personally, I don't think there's anything wrong with killing DEs in combat and then getting upset about the Remembrall. Or even murdering DEs in their sleep, or really anyone the MC doesn't like and then getting upset about the Remembrall. People can be murderous towards their enemies /and/ not like when someone bullies their friends. They should just not be called amoral then, but at least the fics I have seen that do such things call their Harry "Dark" and not "amoral".

** IMO, the dark side is summed up best by Voldemort in book one. "There is no good and evil, only power and those too weak to seek it." Light cannot exist without creating shadow, and darkness is but the absence of light. Voldemort and Dumbledore both act to destroy the opposing side,not realizing they can't. Calling something dark is stupid, because darkness and evil are two separate traits, granted, ones that enjoy each other's presence, but separate nonetheless.

** Regarding Voldemort torturing his own minions: I initially shared your objection to what seems to be a ludicrously counterproductive management technique, but then a friend pointed out that these particular minions have the utmost respect for pointless cruelty. Anyone seeking to ensure the loyalty of these minions needs to prove himself to be a qualified leader by their standards, and that means flaunting his cruelty.

Since, if anyone actually has that mindset, I try to avoid them, I don't know if minion-management actually works like this, but it seems like a possibility. What seems like pointless cruelty might actually be carefully-thought-out minion management.

Of course, there's also something to be said for trying to recruit a better class of minion, but maybe he just did the best he could with the resources available to him.

*** That's... huh. I hadn't thought of that. That does make a certain amount of sense. You have to prove yourself a great leader by the metric of those you seek to lead. If they value cruelty, then you have to be the cruelest. Much like if they value kindness and charity, you have to be the kindest and most charitable.

It's an error due to the fact that in the modern world most people value things other then cruelty in a leader, so most have a hard time realizing that for those that do, voldemorts actions are ideal.

Like if Dumbledore went off the deep end and really just started /forcing/ people to do what he wanted.

The funny thing is Voldemort spent decades putting all his little pieces together, from his first Horcrux to graduating to finding the artefacts to disappearing for a while to putting together the Knights Walpurgis and so on. He's incredibly irrational in canon but has the ability to meddle in a fashion one could argue is clearly Dumbledore-esque.

** Pretty much what you said. But then, that's fanfics. Most of the authors that write them are not good at it, I'd wager a lot of them are rather immature, and hell, they are writing fanfic for a world that is all entirely black and white morality, where white means good and pure and always nice and forgiving and empathetic, and black means dark and evil and cruel and psychopathic. Hell, there's a lot of full grown adults that have issues understanding that dark/evil doesn't have to mean wantonly cruel and murderous.

Light/Good/Empathic/Selfless\\
Dark/Evil/Sociopathic/Selfish\\
Everyone's on a point somewhere on a sliding scale between the two. How much do you care about other peoples wants/needs versus how much you care about your own wants/needs. Of course, in reality, even someone leaning heavily towards the selfish side will have exceptions, things they won't do, people they consider significantly more important, etc.\\
But that's too complex for many authors, so they just crank up the selfish side to maximum, to the point that a few moments of personal amusement is worth more then another persons life. Usually to the absurd point of stupidity. Hell, Canon!Voldemort is exactly that, cranked 110% to the selfish side, with a healthy dollop of that "Evil-induced-stupidity". Such as torturing his followers with a curse that causes brain/nerve damage.

It would be nice to read some good dark!harry stories that can handle morality in a less childish ways, but alas, the vast majority of fanfic writers are shit, and have self control issues, they just cant seem to help taking everything to the extreme. Sometimes it comes through in harry having a harem of every named, and unnamed girl, complete with expy girls from other materials. Sometimes it comes through as literally every wizard in the world being gay. And sometimes that comes through as a murderous psychopath harry that just can't stop killing for even a single chapter. And all without any consequences from the world at large.

** Light Harry - Dumbledore Jr, everybody deserves a second chance, follows what everybody says he should do.

Grey Harry - Still a good person and aiming for the betterment of society but willing to go to more extreme lengths to stop Voldemort which may include killing death eaters and using dark magic. Harry is more self aware and less likely to blindly trust people because others do.

Dark Harry - A Harry that is more selfish and looking only to achieve his goals no matter who gets hurt on the way. The ends justify the means. Usually a more political Harry who aims to put his family back on top.

Evil Harry - The world fucked me over so its time ti fuck the world back. Sadistic Harry who is obsessed with getting back at everyone and has less defined goals other than getting back at everyone who hurt him.

An example of how each would face the same scenario is the Dursley's.

Light Harry forgives them and still stays there because Dumbledore says so.

Grey Harry says no and leaves them, doesn't care what happens beyond that, he just puts it behind him and forgets about it.

Dark Harry wants a bit of pay back and oerhaos uses his wealth or political clout to get Vernon demoted and Dudley expelled to just genuinely make life difficult for them and ruin their reputation of being good people.

Evil Harry slaughters them and never looks back, perhaps even tortured them for what they did to him.

  I see this all the time in "DaRk!HaRrY" fics, where he just randomly murders someone (Tonks, or Ron, or whoever else) either for shock value or to show how eeeevil he is.

  That's about the level of canon Voldemort, who is a mustache-twirling villain, not a convincing dark character. (seriously, you can't run an organisation by constantly torturing your officers and soldiers with a spell known to cause brain and nerve damage) Not to mention when it happens in "grey" fics, which are often darker than those aforementioned "dark" ones.

Chaotic Evil.

#+begin_quote
  An amoral or dark character acts much less like a rabid beast (notice how Greyback is used in most fics - as a weapon), but as a self-interested person only out for their own goals. The lengths they are willing to go to define if the character is dark, grey or light.

Neutral Evil.

#+begin_quote
  You can make a dark character with any motivation, too - a character doesn't meed to have ruling ambitions or destructive tendencies to be so. For instance, you could make a Dark!Ravenclaw!Harry who does not shy back from experimenting with integrating basilisk biology into his own, or researching phoenix immortality, even if it causes pain or death to said phoenix.

  And lastly, a dark!character still needs to integrate into the story's world - They can't go around murdering indescriminantly with no consequences of any kind, or without reason.
