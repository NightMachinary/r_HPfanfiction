I've been thinking about horcruxes a lot lately and I was wondering if anyone had written a fic where the Potterverse somehow turns to Bulma to create a radar to hunt horcruxes, based on her Dragon Ball radar ?

Crossover might include Goku, Vegeta and the others, but not necessarily.


** Talk about shortest crossover ever... Goku uses instant transmission to teleport Tom into space.....

** I've been through the entire HPxDBZ section on FFN and that is not there.

There is one where Goku ends up teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts.
