***** Thinks for the spellcheck.

To why people of power only knowing, I'd say that it's more likely that it's people who are more likely to come in contact with the Flamels, giving power/ influence makes it easier for the outcome. However It's possible that others in history have found out about them, some just everyday normal witches/wizards.

Voldemort finding out, or almost finding out, would be probably be along the same lines as how he found out about the elder wand, small clues throughout history and all that. Pluse, anyone who has made a way to live forever would have Voldemort's attention, as we know from the first book.

I generally recommend the PDF/eBook version at [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/tag/2.2.1]] but full disclosure, I've been a significant contributor to it. It has a lot of typos fixed, and includes all 43 chapters, cover art, and two one-shot recursive fanfics by other authors.

****** I really like Ginny's involvement. It's a little two-edged, because of the age gap, but Harry's very aware of it, so they're not actually dating (at least by chapter 43); he's basically just hopelessly devoted to her, and she's aware and happy about it. On the positive side, though, she's heavily involved from the start, and I really like her characterisation.

** Isn't the reason that the sorting hat works *is* because it contains a bit of each of the souls of the founders? Is there any other way to insert your soul into an inanimate object beyond creating a horocrux through murder? That seems like a very dark premise for founding a school. And does that mean that it was created through four murders?

If so, who had to die to create the Sorting Hat? Are they still wandering the halls of Hogwarts as specters? Say, house ghosts? Hmmm.

** Once upon a time, the four founders each heard a knock on the door. Each reacted differently. Gryffindor, fearing it was Slytherin, drew his want and exploded the door. Amidst the rubble, looking not in the slightest surprised, stood Death. 'Hello Godric,' he said calmly. 'I thought I'd introduce myself. I am Death, bearer of souls, and in a month I will take you away in whatever manner you think befitting. Since you leave a lot behind, I thought I'd warn you.' With that, he left. Slytherin, when he heard the knock-knock-knock, slipped out of the backdoor, and walked around the house, hoping to catch Gryffindor or whichever founder it was from behind. Death met him halfway, and told him the same thing. Ravenclaw, who had been out for a bit, was /very/ surprised when she came back to a intruder lounging on her couch, scythe nonchalantly placed against the wall, but she kept her cool, as did Hufflepuff later. 'I see you solved my riddle,' see said, amiably enough. 'Would you like a cup of tea?' 'Technically I do not need the sustenance,' he replied. 'But it's a nice gesture all the same.' And he told her, too, that she had but a month to live. 'Well,' she said, after a pause. 'Thank you for informing me.' Hufflepuf welcomed his visitor as he would any visitor and Death, now quite tired, left him soon. They all agreed to meet up on neutral territory. All were worried for their legacy. In the end, Slytherin and Ravenclaw came up with a idea; ask if their most loyal followers would sacrifice themselves so part of them could stay. The question was, of course, where and how. Gryffindor came up with the idea to use the hat and selected his first choice; a noble and brave knight. The knight agreed, prefering to die by beheading. They were not very practised at that, so it took some time before he actually died and they could bind him to the castle (in return) and bind a piece of Gryffindor to the hat. Ravenclaw and Slytherin chose at the same time. Slytherin told a baron he knew to be particularly volatile and in love with Ravenclaws daughter that Rowena asked him to pass on her request to go find the diadem (for he desired it very much) and the daughter. He also told him that, if he did well, he could die a honourable death for his lord. The baron was willing, and, exactly as Slytherin planned, enraged when the daughter neither returned the love nor the diadem. When he killed her, and saw her beautiful body on the ground in front of him, her pale skin slick with blood, her lips wet and red like roses, he couldn't bear to live with himself. Forgetting completely the agreement Slytherin had made him sign, he killed himself. The most unwilling horcrux yet, forever angry at being stuck in Hogwarts. Ravenclaw knew nothing of this, of course and chose a young maiden and as her location, the door to the dormatry. When the double murder happened, and the baron and the daughter returned, the ritual was already going on. Thus it was that she had two horcruxes. Hufflepuf asked a portly friar he knew well, and the friar agreed to it if he, too, could be linked to the castle and keep a eye on the pupils.

Godric died first, in a duel with Slytherin, who died next. Ravenclaw followed soon after; a pile of books crushed her. Hufflepuf died comfortably in front of a fire.
