In all love potion trope fics I read, Weasleys are always evil and either they want Harry's money or Ginny is mad and wants the Boy-Who-Lived or Ron is a rapist. I don't like bashing so I don't enjoy those kind of fics. Maybe there are some without bashing? I don't know. However yesterday I was talking with a few friends about tropes in Harry Potter fanfiction and how to subvert them and I got this idea. What if some /Bad Guysâ„¢/ decided to create some /Unnecessary Teenage Drama/ by dosing the trio with /Love Potions/ in their 6th year?

 

Sort of canon compliant scenario:

Perhaps they thought Harry and Hermione were already in a relationship and dosed Hermione with Ron's and dosed Harry with Ginny's thinking that Ron being the elder brother, wouldn't want his /Baby Sister/ dating any boy. Maybe they even dosed Ron with first Lavander's and later Hermione's which would create even more drama. And maybe they stopped dosing them after the first semester to make them not realize they were dosed. Or Dumbledore and/or Snape realized what was going on and secretly gave them antidotes. However trio having memories of their first semester intact, couldn't just stop their lingering feelings and the drama continued.

 

Is there any fics with similar premise? Doesn't have to be canon compliant of course. Just that someone dosed gryffindors with love potions to disrupt their unity.


** How about that:

Harry's potion is keyed to Ron, while Hermione's is keyed to Ginny.

** This is a hilariously complex plan. I don't think you could play it straight, but a crack fic or just satire would be amazing.

Perfect for overconfident, teenage Slytherins - you can actually have it blow up in their faces.
