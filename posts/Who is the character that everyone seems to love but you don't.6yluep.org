There are characters who are universally hated like Umbridge, othet characters have people's opinion divided like Snape or Ron. And there also those who every one seems to like like Mcgonagall or the Twins.

Well I don't like Fred and George, I don't hate them, they're actually good people But I can't stand their pranks or that they complete each others sentences. I didn't even cry when Fred died.

So, who is that character who every one praises and love and you just don't, not necessarily one you hate, it could be one who although is important, you don't give a damn about him or her

** In canon? The Weasleys as a whole. They're far more interesting to me individually than as a group -- which is probably why Ron and Percy are the ones that I like most from the books. You get to see them outside the context of their family more often, Ron because he's one of the "big three" in the books, and Percy because he actually breaks with his family for a while. The rest are basically just ... there.

In fic, fanon!Hermione is my bane. The "brightest witch of her age" who is beautiful despite her +frizzy+ curly hair; the girl with all the answers; the girl who has the inability to be wrong ... you know the one. She's been flaw-scrubbed to the point of sainthood, which is sad since canon Hermione is both fallible and interesting.

** Snape. I hate the fact that he's all of a sudden redeemed. I liked Snape's revelation at first, because he became human. A bad guy who did a good thing.

Snape-lovers, Lily did not abandon Snape, Snape started hanging out with the wrong crowd way before anything happened. Remember in the flashbacks, she says, "Potter's an arrogant toe-rag, but your friends are actually bad people". Snape's friends tortured one of Lily's friends. Everything that happened to Snape was something that he deserved.

And let's not forget he sold them out in the first place prophecy wise, and even after figuring out they were targeting the Potters, he didn't want to save James or Harry. This is the opposite of how James saved Snape when he found out Sirius's trick on him. James hated Snape, but he still didn't want him dead, and so he went and saved him.

tl;dr - Snape's a bad dude who did 1 good thing and gets treated like the second coming of Jesus Christ

** I don't really care for Luna Lovegood.

I don't /hate/ her as she's portrayed in canon, but nobody ever writes Luna like she's portrayed in canon. She's a hard character to get right. She should make people uncomfortable, not be enjoyably quirky and serene. So many people treat her like a Native American spirit animal or something.

Hell, an uncharitable interpretation of canon Luna is that she has close to zero social IQ and that she's a paranoid conspiracy theorist. And by the way, none of her pet theories are ever shown to be correct. This type of person can be fun to read about, but it's why most other characters don't like her. And it' really, really hard to get that across in a fic. Either other characters for no good reason hate Luna even though she turns out to be right about everything, or the characters all love Luna (who usually still turns out to be right about everything).

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

*** You know my personal pet theory is that Luna is right about everything, she just uses wildly inappropriate and hard to understand language to covey her ideas.

If she's trying to say that she makes people around her insecure by being to direct in her observations, because those observations confront people with their inner demons too much, and those people then start to try and hurt her as a result by stealing her stuff, what does she say? "The nargles hide my stuff, but don't worry they mean well".

How does that make any sense at all? Well, Luna sees peoples actions as springing from the own inner demons and pains and frustrations, she understands this instinctively. She doesn't have a PHD in psychology so she doesn't know how to express this at all, so what does she say? Nargle infestation! Nargles made people act mean, i.e. nargles are responsible for people stealing her stuff. She doesn't blame them because what compassionate person blames people for being hurt, frustrated and not self-aware enough to do something about that? She probably tries to help by pointing out people have nargles, which of course backfires dramatically.

People without "Nargles" have absolutely zero problem with Luna as a person and would probably find her more quirky and amusing. People with shitloads of "Nargles" will hate her. Simple.

And..missletoe keeps the nargles away ebcauase it's asociated with a tradition of love and intimacy which is death to frustration and pain in a very real way.

If you squint just right it actually makes a whole bunch of sense, although I have no idea if that was intended or just fortuitous.

Who knows. Fanon dictates that her head of house duties were likely lacking due to her other responsibilities. She was also the head of transfiguration and the deputy headmistress, the latter of which was likely a full time job since Dumbledore was too busy running Wizarding Britain in all but name for the first half of the series. "As long as the students haven't killed each other and the school's still standing, it can wait" was probably McG's philosophy for some time.

**** Okay, this is going to get long.

They're interesting characters in their canon struggles and motivations. For Sirius I see him and Snape (my favourite character) as foils to each other (Boy from a pureblood supremacist family chooses the light side with some traces of darkness in him, and Boy from half-blood family in the muggle world chooses the dark side with some traces of light in him; also their different reactions once their best friends died etc). I think he's someone who's actually really angsty but uses pranks and jokes to mask it. I think he had issues before Azkaban itself and I want to know what was going on in his head when he sent Snape to the Shrieking Shack, how his friendship with Remus was afterwards, what made him suggest Peter as the Secret-keeper later and suspect Remus of being the spy etc. Post-Azkaban Sirius trying to find glory of days past with Harry is interesting too, while realizing that the past is gone and Harry isn't much like his father. This is my interpretation of the character and I can see why others disagree but I can't stomach most fanon depictions of him as the "happy-go-lucky prankster" or "cool biker dad".

Remus is also a fascinating character who really isn't represented enough in fanfiction. He's very insecure and frightened of losing his friends and even though he doesn't agree with their behaviour, he goes along with it. He's not brash like James and Sirius but from some instances in canon, I think he's acually very passive-aggressive and responds with indirect taunts. He puts on a veneer of politeness and amicability which distracts from some of his potentially harmful actions (like not informing Dumbledore about Sirius being an animagus that entire year). I'm very interested in his interactions with the Marauders after the Werewolf incident because I think that sort of created fractures. Why was he suspected as the spy? And later on his relationship with Tonks. I might get downvotes for this but that relationship never made much sense to me. I don't know how much he was actually into her, how much he felt obligated to and how much was a way of dealing with Sirius's death but I'd like to know more about it. At the same time, I think he was very kind and empathetic and his ability to relate to people made him a great teacher. I also think he would have made a better father-figure for Harry than Sirius but that's just me. Yeah, I see him as a very damaged person with unresolved issues but he's more interesting to me that way than the "studious chocolate addict".

** I don't like Hermione in canon or fanon most of the time. It bothers me that she's shown as the only ambitiously smart character. I mean yes there are Ravenclaws, but the way Hermione is shown, it's like her intelligence separates her and makes her special and unique. As someone who excells in academics to the point where mentioning my SAT score is considered rude, I find it bizarre that Hermione is the singularly hyper competent person at Hogwarts. When I was in high school there were a hundred Hermiones in my class and they all had great social skills, moreso even then me. I feel like Hermione as a character made girls feel like being academicly inclined would make you amazing and special and give you all the opportunities in the world, that academics would make you the hero. Because that's how she made me feel. But they won't, all the ivy league grades in the world can't make you successful without social skills. I guess she just makes me feel lied to, she's a pale imitation of the intelligent students I know.

******* Why do you love Wolfstar? It is an extremely unhealthy relationship that ignores aspects of Sirius and Remus as characters. I don't find it a happy, fluffy relationship and Sirius is /always/, and I mean, /always/, a whiny little kid that cannot tell left from right without Remus there to guide him. Sirius was much more intelligent than Remus in canon so here's an aspect ignored.

Sirius and James were described as brothers and they weren't seen without each other. It never said Sirius and Lupin were inseparable but Sirius and James. Sirius loved James the most out of everyone he ever knew. Unarguably. A second aspect ignored. Even then don't I see Sirius as gay. You can't shove James aside for the sake of a ship. That's the beauty of James's presence in Sirius's life.

The 'prank'. Sirius always puts his loved ones first. That's perfectly established in canon. Before going after Peter he tried to get custody over Harry but failed so he gave him to Hagrid. People forget that, so why on earth would Sirius lead Snape to the love of his life? He knew that Remus was dangerous and at that time he didn't see him as Remus but he saw him as a monster. That's messed up. He wasn't even remorseful at all as we see in the Shrieking Shack scene. Even if they /were/ star struck lovers (which I find highly unlikely) I think they'd end it but remain friends. No romantic relationship works that way. We also know that Remus never truly trusted Sirius after that. That's unhealthy and dark.

Sirius's will. He didn't leave Remus a single Knut. Not a single Knut when he knew his friend was in need. That speaks enough. How was he able to hand Kreacher over to Harry if he didn't renew his will? I don't know, unless he was a seer. A lousy one, too.

The beauty of Remadora is that Tonks was the first woman to accept Remus for who he was. If Remus was in a relationship with Sirius before that he wouldn't be that hesitant to start a brand new one with Tonks. Remadora is one of the best ships in my opinion and one of the deeper ones. Remus had finally found peace with Tonks as his /first/ lover as per the words of Pottermore.

Sirius and Remus had suspicions towards each other in the First War. That's the biggest reason that Wolfstar doesn't work. You always trust your lover. You always think the highest of them. Why would they suspect each other if Remus didn't think Sirius was just like the other Blacks and Sirius still held prejudice against werewolves, however faint. I would never suspect my husband as a spy even if it was apparent. Sirius still had prejudices from his time with his family andbremus still held prejudices against the Blacks.

Remus has low self esteem so even if he was bisexual he wouldn't have been comfortable with coming out in the 1970s and would've stayed closeted in my opinion, however sad that is, that's Remus. If he was bisexual then I don't think he would've fallen for Sirius, simple as that. Just like I don't think Hermione would fall for Snape, say.

Personally, I'd always viewed James as the glue of the Marauders. Sirius would never have gotten introduced to Remus if James hadn't befriended him. I always viewed Sirius and Remus as the least close members of the Marauders and Sirius and James always stuck together. What's more, Sirius hung muggle posters of women in bikinis. He could've easily posted muggle posters of men if he was gay and his family would've been much more outraged. He would've been disowned on the spot. Bisexual might be a possibility but is also unlikely because he could've hanged posters of both. So I see Sirius as straight.

The beauty of the Marauders is that they were all perfectly platonic towards each other and that their love was just as strong without romance. That's why I love the friendship. It was all about it.

I'm not trying to shame Wolfstar shippers (most of whom hate Remadora aka Tonks and would pick at tiny details that would make the ship work. The forty line stare and embraced like a brother is ridiculous). I'm just trying to say why Wolfstar wouldn't work and you're still free to ship it but please don't portray it as a happy and fluffy relationship when it wasn't. And it certainly wasn't canon.

Edit: I also get that LGBT people want to see characters like themselves. Characters they can relate with and represent them. I get that because I'm Muslim (we are not the best of friends are we?) and we're not exactly loved. Of course, not all people are like that. Not all look at the misconceptions. I yearn for a proper character that represents real Muslim women (not the Saudi ones of course, these are not exactly accurate representations of ourselves) but there are none, sadly. Everything is clouded over with misconceptions. We're not exactly represented more in the media. And I mean proper representation. Like, I don't think LGBT people want an LGBT character that has depth that only sticks to their sexuality. They want themselves represented just like normal people with the same depth, etc. stuff that doesn't just pertain to a sexuality.

Yes you can. That's the beauty of fanfiction and shipping. You can do whatever you want with it. If you think fanfiction is all about adhering to canon, you won't have a lot of reading material left. Also people don't ship things because it makes sense in canon or because it's healthy. They ship it because they like the characters and like seeing them together. Everyone's definition of OOC, especially regarding sexuality, differs so while you might see Sirius as straight, someone else might think he's bi or gay. They might also find it interesting to pair Sirius and Remus together and how it affects their characters.

********* I didn't claim that people should only ship healthy ships. What I meant is that if you want to ship Wolfstar, you should ship it in its entirety. You should consider past events of Sirius and Remus's life together. If you want to see two characters' chemistry in a romantic relationship with each other then portray them how they were in canon. For example, Sirius's portrayal in /The Life and Times/ is the most accurate ever. /That's Sirius/. He's /not/ a whiny and stupid kid. He wasn't an idiot. Sirius was the top of his class so he wasn't stupid.

So instead of portraying Wolfstar as 100% happy and glossing over everything that happened in their lives please consider all the past events that build their relationship together and how it's is a relationship with lots of bumpy rides, etc. it'd make it much more beautiful in my opinion. Wolfstar is not a silly ship. They're not all fluffy and happy. It should be portrayed as a relationship with obstacles. That's it.

Also, you can't shove James aside without good reason. Sirius went to James's house in the summer after he ran, not Remus's place. James's place. So I need a pretty good reason why Sirius and James became more distant than usual in order for Wolfstar to work. Just like I need a good enough reason for Hermione to cut her friendship with Harry and Ron in order of the Dramione ship to work.

I /do/ actually know what the beauty of fanfiction is, thank you very much. That's why I ship Harry/Luna and will not read a glossed over one. That's why I read lots of AUs and that's why I read OOC people with /good/ reason.

Again, you're free to ship whatever you want and I don't care. Just portray the ship as a hard one because it would be.

*** I sympathize with your lack of appreciation for the Twins. I'm not really that a great fan of them.

Other very popular characters I don't like that much (although still like) are Harry, Luna, and McGonagall.

In Luna's case, I know someone in RL who will defend her conspiracy theories with the fervor of a religious fundamentalist. I don't like that person at all. Luna of course has far more redeeming qualities, but that aspect still reduces my appreciation for her.

** Luna. I don't mind her in canon at all, but I usually dislike her portrayal in fics - especially the Harry/Luna ones. They just seem too forced. Same thing with Hermione, honestly.

** Harry, actually.

It is consistently frustrating to watch the hero of the story act like a doormat. Not that I want badass independent Harry, but more just a Harry that consistently acts like a teenage boy. JKR didn't write that bit terribly well, IMO.

** Ginny Weasley. Both in the canon books, canon movies, and fanon. Don't necessarily hate her but don't really care for her either. The only thing I can say one way or the other is that I hate how she ended up with Harry in canon. My personal headcanon pairing will always be Harry Potter x Hermione Granger. Honestly though, I'd take just about any other female character in the series of Ginny though.

** Ron Weasley (damned fucking jealous slacker - damned, buddy get over your fucking issues or look for a quiet corner to die in! Nobody will miss you, especially if it happens during GOF or after you left in DH!)

Hermione Granger (so smart - yet so dumb, especially when listening to adults who have it wrong (Dumbledore sending Harry back to the Dursleys!)...or not listening to friends (Harry in HBP!) which leads to a lot of people dying (it's not like they couldn't have moved or destroyed that vanishing cabinet!))...funny thing about that: I love girls like her in RL (smart tomboyish girls who'd rather spend those extra 5 minutes reading then putting on makeup and who are ready for most things as fast as I am (instead of taking hours like those high-maintenance princesses?)? HOT!...as long as they have grown up from worshipping authority and books (both can be wrong after all!) and if they have left their bossyness behind (can't stand it!))

Sadly: I could list tons of reasons to dislike most characters! Hell, the only one character I really like in HP is Sirius Black (yes: I know he has his flaws (he tried to freaking kill Snape after all and would have probably got Remus killed, too with the prejudices against "dark" creatures!), but most others are worse IMHO!)
