You know all those fanfiction where Harry is living a shitty future so he travels back in time to change things. 90% of the times he always hooks up with the girl he fell in love in the future(because true love and all that shit). Now here's the thing. Even though future Harry is back in his teenage or prebubescent body,his mind is still that of an adult. So when he romances the girl who will be his girlfriend/wife in the future,who are still teenagers btw, doesn't that seem weird? I mean technically it's an adult man in a teen's body? Doesn't it sound like grooming when he uses his knowledge of the future to influence the girl's opinion of her,like knowing her favourite food/location or her secrets?


** Yes, it's grooming.

Other side: anyone he dates that is an intellectual equal is committing statutory rape at best and is a child molester at worst, depending upon his age.

Better to just not have a pairing in time travel fics, or to have his paired come back with him.

*** Realistically, even where the girl is the same person as his wife in his previous life, seeing her as a teenager from an adult's perspective would completely put him off her. Teenagers are just the worst.

I'd love to see one of these peggy sue fics where Harry runs into Ginny (or whoever was his wife in that story) but she's just so immature that he can't stand to spend time with her. He realises that he can never have back what he had before.

Ultimately, you can never have the same relationship twice. Even if the maturity factor wasn't a problem, you still have the fact that he knows everything about her but she knows nothing about him. That disparity in familiarity would completely change the dynamic of any relationship.

Except his body. The point with an "older" partner isn't that Harry is grooming them, it is that the other person finds the body of a child sexually attractive. It's even questionable if you have a couple travelling back, even if they knew each other since age 11 and were teenage sweethearts. But for a random stranger to start digging Harry's 12 year old body would be quite distrubing.

***** Bear in mind, dating does not automatically nor immediately mean sexual attraction. Someone who knows Harry is mentally 20+ might want to date him because she enjoys his company, and there could even be a degree of romance that matches their mental ages without crossing legal lines. It's still problematic, just a different set of problems.

No need for Harry to be two or three centuries old to make him powerful, 25 to 35 years old Harry travelling to 6th or 7th year and paired with Fleur or Tonks is good enough. In canon Tonks was paired with Remus who was in his late thirties or early forties.

If he is travelling along with his body then 30 to 50 year old Harry could be paired with likes of Amelia Bones or Narcissa Malfoy.

If an immortal MoD Harry travelling then he better not have a pairing. In crossovers he can be paired with asgardians or Amazonians...etc.

Lupin was born in 59/60. That puts him at 36-38. Tonks is born 73, so that's 13-14 years difference. Tonks to canon Harry is 6-7 years, depending on her exact birthday.

** It kinda depends on the form the travel takes. If he's going back with the same personality and memories, it's 100% grooming and gross. If he goes back and kind of 'melds' his memories with his younger self, it may be fine-ish depending on how it's handled - IE, it's clear this is teenage Harry with fragments of memory and instincts from his previous life, but they are not at all dominant. Still feels weird to me, though.

I'm a big advocate for aging up Hogwarts in general if a five needs it (let's the writer have better ways to work in stuff like politics and the war without involving 12 year olds), and it works better for time travel with romance in it, too. Add to that a Harry that's not too old, and it feels like a 24 year old in an 18 year old's body wouldn't be quite as creepy

Agree, in this case it feels less like an adult travelling back and more like a child having visions of the future, so it doesn't give me the "ughh he's an older guy among kids" feel.

** This is one of the reasons I hate time travel fics so much. I have browsed through a lot of them and immediately drop the fic if it has this. This leaves me with few time travel stories of this nature that I can read.

Fics in which the girl knows he is a time traveler and they don't get together until they both are of age and preferably the girl convincing him to give them a try. That is my ideal fic if the fic has romance and older Harry drops into younger Harry's body.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start]] is the only fic I can think of from top of my head that fulfills it. It pretty much declares it in the summary that it is safe to read.

** My biggest gripe with time travel stories is that they almost always neglect what a psychological trauma that would be for the traveler. Even one that actually wanted to go back now has to deal with being a full grown man in the body of a child. Not to mention all the problems they bring with them, depending on their timeline, like PTSD, survivor's guild, depression, and so on.

I feel like actual time travel back to your childhood would be so much more taxing on the nerves than fanfic credits it to be.

** I'd like to see more stories have the younger Harry absorb the memories of past Harry, either all of them(that he mostly wouldn't consciously remember anyway because no one does) or key memories that Harry had chosen or perhaps it happens imperfectly and Harry has to do magic stuff to try reawake certain memories. Then we have someone who's just a kid who a) isn't sure if he's sane or not and b) while has memories of being an adult, views it through the eyes of a kid who didn't actually experience what Harry did.

** well, yes. It is grooming.

What marks the quality of such a fic (to me) is how this is adressed within the story. If the time-traveler is upset, stressed and worried about the pressure and expectations they are putting upon their would-be love interest I'm a happy guy. It might be grooming, but at least the time-traveler is conscious about the potential horror they are inflicting upon their love.

If The time-traveler is happy to just pursue all the bubbly and bouncy love interests suddenly showing interest in them, or worse being actively assisted by a fellow adult who should know better, I suddenly feel like I'm reading some kid-diddlers private fapbait. Disgusted and apathetic to the time-traveler.

edit: I had "Nightmares of Futures Past" & "Stealing witches and dodging Prison" as my mental examples in this post.

I dislike "Stealing witches and dodging Prison" (wasn't the name the other way around?) for a multitude of reason, and stopped following it. But from what I remember, if I should give it one quality, it is the fact that Harry is totally doesn't lie to himself about grooming grils for a harem. He is still an ass, but at least an honest one.

*** Nightmares of Futures Past is one of my favorites, and I think it handles the situation effectively.

- Harry recognises the problem, and as of fourth year, they're not actually dating. Even though they both know that the other is interested.

- Ginny, by this point, knows about the time travel, and that they dated in the first timeline. She is ok with that. Granted, she's only 13, so her being ok with it counts for less, but still, it's there.

- Charlie is aware of the situation and has made it clear that he's going to hold Harry to account for how he treats Ginny. Harry is ok with that.

- Harry hasn't acted possessively toward Ginny. Protectively, yes, absolutely. But he's been building her up, increasing her confidence and helping her to establish more friendships with people who support her. He's also been teaching her and her family to defend themselves, to the point where she beat him in a duelling tournament and he praised her for it. That's not the behavior of a stalker. He's set things up so that there is no way he could get away with mistreating her.

- Harry's mental age is more complicated than "adult in a teenager's body." His emotional development was rather stunted by thirteen years of war, and then he didn't just replace his younger self, they fused - meaning that the memories of having been a child were fresh in his mind, not nineteen years old. And he's in a younger body, with teenage hormones; that influences his thinking, too.

- Harry literally died in order to come back and try to save everyone. Dude has earned some trust.

**** I'ts because I consider it utterly stupid. First, if you're a time-traveller and you're at Hogwarts, you go and tell Dumbledore all you know. Period. Unless you only time-travelled like two years, that pretty much solves the Voldemort problem. If you don't want to tell Dumbledore because you don't trust him, well... that's usually "Dumbledore Bashing" in the works, so another reason to drop the story. (And if it's "Evil scumbag goes back in time", well - I'm not interested in villain protagonist stories. Especially not stories that have them go to Hogwarts in a child's body.)

Further, Dumbledore telling a time-traveller in a child's body to "act like a student" is utterly moronic. Why would he feel the need to send an adult to play a child? Best case, the bloke's going to be bored stiff by the stupid antics of preteen kids. Worst case, you just sent a fox into the henhouse. No, if you have an adult in a child's body, you make up some excuse about some prodigy, and then allow the poor guy to act like an adult and interact with adults most of the time - hell, you've got magic and you're Dumbledore, perhaps fix their body so it matches their mental age while you're at it.

Generally, pretty much every plot that requires a time traveller in a child's body to act like a kid is heavy-handed and stupid because there's no reason for it, other than the author's desire to write those scenes or an author's inability to give the stations of canon the boot.

** Linkffn(30 minutes that changed everything) solves this issue nicely by having the HP who travels back be an incorporeal avatar of sorts who mentors and aids young Harry and Co. He's also not the main focus of the story, though we do read from his perspective on occasion. It's a fic I highly enjoy repeated readings of and definitely recommend.

** I prefer it when he waits a couple years (because he's still battling with his idea of the girl and her personality at her current age) and then starts the dating that goes at a fairly slow pace until they're officially of age.

It's weird when they get into the smut while they're underage.

I mean, it's a good content warning to put in that there's grooming. I hardly think it's grooming when they just act as friends. But it's fiction, and if romance in the time-travel fics where he returns to his child/teen body isn't your thing, then it's not your cup of tea. Smut and romance is common in all kinds of fics. I just skip over the parts I don't like or close the tab and find another fic.

She's not supposed to be able to stay there, so eventually it'll catch up or she'll have to go back, and he'll be in his 30s and she'll be a teenager. It's creepy and weird.
