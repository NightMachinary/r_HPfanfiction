**** I'd be interested in this too, if someone finds it!

There's one I know of, linkao3(The Historic Importance of Runic War Warding in the British Isles by Samvelg), but it's fem!Harry. They marry their way out of the war. Incomplete. There's one more I know of, but unfortunately it rapidly devolves into bad porn, so I doubt you want that one.

#+begin_quote
  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.
