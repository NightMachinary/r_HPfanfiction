Fics where Harrys animagus form is a magical creature


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lightning Scar): After PoA, Sirius and Remus send Harry on vacation to America, to learn how to become an Animagus, and actually have a fun summer for once in his life. [[/spoiler][Thunderbird animagus, motherfucker]]

linkffn(The Refiners Fire by Abraxan; The Time of Destiny by Abraxan): Harry undergoes a special magical illness only two others have ever survived which makes his magic... better for lack of a less spoilery word. Multiple animagus, with multiple magical forms.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prophecy of the Phoenix by Storyspindler): just take a guess at what his form is here.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Origin War): This fic pisses me off because it is incomplete, but oh well. [[/spoiler][Dire wolf]] is his form.

** Fics I can think of with a magical animagus form:\\
linkffn(4040192) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4040192/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Lived]] - If I remember correctly, Harry is a Phoenix animagus in this fic.\\
linkffn(11872375) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11872375/1/The-Dragonborn][The Dragonborn]] - Right, so Harry is Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark's son. He's a dragon animagus of course, because Targaryen. Its also +win+ incest. He also kinda just stomps everything so if you have a thing for OP Harry.

I don't remember much about Harry Potter and the Girl Who Lived but I don't remember it being utterly terrible considering I managed to finish it but YMMV. Dragonborn is not very good. I just read it because I was going through a GoT phase. I'm pretty sure theres more but nothing comes immediately to mind so I'll dig around my favorites to see if anything else comes to memory.

Edit: linkffn(4826372) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4826372/1/Harry-Mewter][Harry Mewter]] - Not sure just how applicable this is, but Harry is the Pokemon Mew. I honestly got bored about halfway through this fic and never finished it. It just felt very slow to me but maybe you'll like it.

Edit 2: linkffn(5087671) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5087671/1/Runic-Animagi][Runic Animagi]] - Harry becomes Animagus through tattooed runes. Read this a while ago but I think he has several animagus forms. I believe he's also a dragon in this fic as well. Another meh fic in my opinion.

Edit 3: I'm pretty sure thats all from me. Honestly, the only animagus fic I would recommend is linkffn(9863146) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12088294/1/Animagus-at-War][Animagus at War]] which is going to cover years 5-7. You might not like it since Harry's animagus form is just a regular cat. Maybe someone else can recommend some decent magical animagus fics.\\
