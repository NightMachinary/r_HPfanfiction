Lets be honest, there are not many fic out there with Ron that is not evil or stupid or possibly both. I personally am not a big Ron fan, but after some time it becomes boring to read all Harry-centered or Hermione-centered fics, where Ron is, at best, a comic relief.

It would be nice change to see Ron-centered fic, where he is more confident and hard-working, and becomes best version of himself. Where he is good, supportive friend (and for example, helps Harry prepare to the Triwizard Tournament, without being jealous jerk), loving boyfriend and powerful wizard overall. We know from cannon that Ron can be all of this, but his complexes, laziness and immaturity hold him back.

Maybe he become motivated, when he saw himself in the Mirror of Erised? Maybe his motivation comes from a time when his beloved sister was taken to the Chamber of Secrets, and he could do nothing? Maybe he is from the future, years after Battle of Hogwarts? Maybe some different reason? Does not really matter, it just would be great to see Ron that is actually useful.


** I always saw Ron as having lots of potential to be ambitious, feeling the need to achieve in order to live up to the standards set by the rest of his family, who were all actually very successful. I've read a few Slytherin Ron fics where gets into Slytherin because he feels the need to stand out, to not just be another Weasley. But I actually feel like canon Ron doesn't mind being ‘just another Weasley' because he sees family as a strength.

I will never forgive JKR for downplaying him in the later books. His ability at chess set him up perfectly to be the strategist of the group, with Harry having the raw magical power and duelling skills and Hermione having all the obscure magical knowledge and Ron having the real world knowledge. But instead Hermione came up with the plans. Ron should've come up with the Ministry break in plan- his dad worked there ffs!

I know this was a prompt and not a request but I absolutely HAVE to recommend this one: linkao3(how to succeed in dark wizardry (without really trying)) . He's a supportive friend in this one but it addresses how the support doesn't really go both ways- for example, he feels hurt that Hermione and Harry left him when he was hurt on the chess board.

*** I'm writing a oneshot that has Hermione leave the trio in DH, not Ron.

If I could go back in time, I'd tell Rowling to do it this way. It would have given all the characters far more dimension without much changes to the plot at all.

Ron and Harry bromance is my favorite thing. I wish more fics focused on friendship, not romance.

  Ron maybe accidentally-on-purpose becomes a dark wizard, and everything changes. (a canon rewrite, with a bit of a twist)(also this is not a 'Ron is Evil, actually' fic so if that's what you're expecting, maybe give this a skip)

** I've been wanting to write something like this but it's really hard writing Ron! I think that's why I give in to the urge to Ron bash in the past. Now all of my stories have stalled because I'm trying to add nuance and it's just not coming very easily at all

That's all to say I agree.

I feel like Ron has serious potential as

a) an actual strategist

b) the one boy in the Gryffindor dorm who has a father in his life, let alone big brothers, and I feel like he should be teaching them to shave and stuff (there is a small fic where this happens and it became my headcanon, I'll see if I can dig it up)

c) I feel like if he saw that in the mirror he should have as many Slytherin traits as Harry, and complimentary ones, esp with the chess lord thing (complimentary in that Harry's ambitions tend to be things like ‘can nothing kill me this year please' and ‘staying out of everyone's attention' which are quite snake like really. where as Ron's are more traditional Slytherin ambitions.

d) someone who would totally love Muggle computer games and stuff. I feel like he has the potential to learn about the Muggle world in ways his dad hasn't actually bothered to. Maybe through comics or something. I'm writing one (or trying) where he has to stay with the Grangers for a summer and discovers Star Wars and Muggle fiction and changes for the better with the attention of the Drs Granger (and Hermione has to grow up a bit from her only child feelings)

anyway my brain is tired but these are my Ron feelings. In short: yes

**** Yeah definitely. Even those feelings are worth exploring. There was a fic I read recently that tackled it quite well, Harry sits down and they play chess and it comes out that Ron honestly just doesn't think there is a piece of the pie for him, like he can't see any options for opportunity for him to go anywhere, so why bother? And as something from a big family and a few rings under where the Weasleys are in canon I can say that's totally a thing for sure. I had to come up with new things for someone in my family to be, but even after forging that stuff I still look around as an adult and realise there were so many options no one explained to me. And I was third born, so I can see how being the sixth child (and followed by the baby who is the only girl) really would leave a lot of situations where people just didn't explain things to him because they'd explained it so many time that they were sure they did, they did, right?

But they didn't and Ron just sort of has to stumble along and figure out a lot, and learn from his brothers, which leads to a lot of assumptions being made and not many nuanced understanding

*** I like point d on your list, and I've had a similar idea of Ron stumbling across muggle fiction, movies or just art in general and being absolutely blown away by just how emotionally evocative it can be.

Like magical artists can make portraits that house a shadow or imprint of their subject, but they feel sterile compared to Ilya Repin's /Ivan the Terrible and his son/ or /Reflections/ by Lee Teter.

Or how the Weird Sisters might have some fun and popular songs, but they are just noise compared to muggle music (everything from classical to heavy metal and rap).

Also, while I deeply enjoy /Star Wars/ and think it sorta fits with the /Harry Potter/ universe, it seems almost cliche for those movies to be the catalyst for change. Westerns and Samurai could have just as big an impact, though possibly in other ways, for Ron.

Imagine him watching /Rashomon/ and being inspired to view things from multiple angles (so to speak) or he is inspired to reign in his temper after watching /Tombstone/ or /Unforgiven/ and seeing how destructive anger and violence got.

Hell he could even admire how Murphy managed to retain his humanity and morals in /Robocop/

**** Oh yeah totally. I feel like sw might not be the catalyst for change so much as an entry point to the concept of movies and entertainment. I haven't seen any of the movies(?) you mentioned but I was going to have him watch one of hermione's karate classes or something and realise how she learned to punch and also that one doesn't need a wand to fight

Even if he's thinking of defending himself from the twins or something he could really do with some lessons on philosophy and just...culture outside of the British magical thingy (my brain is not being intelligent right now so I hope that makes sense)

Like the Weasleys had gone to Egypt the year before (because it takes place after year three due to Sirius fucking up Ron's mouth when he went after Scabbers) but I can imagine Molly being one of those brits that insists on making all British food and basically being as British as possible in a place that has so much to learn but why learn anything when British is best? And poor Bill hasn't been eating proper food in so long...Etc etc

Maybe Hermione went through an Egypt phase as we all did as a kid and has some awesome books and Ron is like ‘actually Bill said something about that and oh actually I guess that IS really cool, huh'

I just know sometimes we get offered awesome experiences and lessons but the synapses don't connect till later and so that's sort of what I'm trying to work out with this story, how it can all come together in a readable way, and not be mugglewank

** The role of Ron in HP canon is as the straight man, the British bloke, the family man, so it's harder to make him come into his own. Same goes for Arthur, Bill and Percy. Writers are also tempted to make him Watson or Robin to Harry's Sherlock and Batman, which is a natural position for such character archetypes.

But digging beneath the surface, I see Ron as being in some respects braver and wiser than Harry and Hermione. It has always been a conundrum for writers, how heroes deal with the requirements of family, and the vast majority of writers go the orphan route. Can't remember if it was JK herself who said it, but someone said that Harry would not have gotten away with half the things he did if he had parental supervision of any kind, hence his orphanhood was vital. Hermione, at the crunch, "solved" the problem of balancing war and family by effectively eliminating her parents, which is a very dark path to go down and in my headcanon must have caused problems. Furthermore H and H are both single children and don't have even siblings to bother with.

Ron doesn't have any of that. He's the polar opposite. And yet he's rallied round to Harry's side in all their adventures, unlike most anyone else with a family in the series. Of course it helps that his whole family joined the war effort, but Ron has been up to his neck since the start. That shows a very firm hidden sense of character about him that is frequently overlooked.

On top of exploring that side of him, it would be interesting to see how Ron's sense of family /aids/ him, and how the lack thereof /hinders/ Harry and Hermione.

*** I definitely don't think he's braver, so to speak; he is unquestionably in a more privileged position than both of the others as a pureblood and someone who has access to family.

The very things that you say are reasons that the other two get away with things are genuinely terrible things. No kid SHOULD be able to or have to get up to the shite that he trio do; I think that exploring the reasons why/lead up to an almost eighteen year old girl will eliminate her parents in such a way should be explored, the idea that she feels she has no other option other then to let them die while she's not there to protect them (if she even could) is important

That said I think that the nuances of Ron's position really isn't explored, and like, that's why I always say that the Weasley parents were neglectful, because Ron shouldn't be able to get up to that stuff either. I say this as someone from a big family whose parents were also not diligent, it's genuinely terrifying thinking of the culture of the Weasleys and what happened to Ginny (and the lack of care afterwards) as well as Ron. Even the way the twins are handled is really scary.

So I don't think he's braver (definitely brave but differently brave), but I do think questioning why he's getting about on these adventures with no one noticing, and, you know, having a rat called Peter Pettegrew sleeping in his bed without his siblings noticing is suss af

(Sorry, but this is a bit of a Thing for me, which is why a solid 50% of my fics involve adults actually doing their fucking jobs lmao!)
