Everything hinges on Snape passing vital information to Harry from Dumbledore. But no solid plan or backups were in place for this event. Snape plan was to simply find Harry and give him the information. It was simply luck that Snape had enough time to provide the memories to Harry before he died.

If Voldemort had waited to confirm Snape's death or used a quicker method to kill him, Snape would have not been able to pass the vital information to Harry. Or if Harry was late or delayed on the way, he would have only witnessed the death in Voldemort's eyes, and again no information passed. There were many number of ways Harry to have not had Snape's memories, including not willing to listen to Dumbledore's killer and not collecting the flowing memories.

So is there any fic that works on this scenario where Harry does not get Snape's memories? Or is anyone willing to write one?


** I always thought this setup was ridiculous (Not your prompt but the canon setup). No matter if you think Snape is a poor misunderstood hero or an utterly evil bastard, Dumbledore's plan for Snape to reveal the need of Harry to sacrifice himself of all possible options /after demanding that Snape kills Dumbledore and pretend to betray the Order/ is one of his most stupid ideas in the entire canon series. What if (as you say) Harry was too late? What if Harry confronts Snape and refuses to listen (because, you know, Snape killed Dumbledore)? What if he assumes Snape's memories is a trap (after all, no matter which side he was on, he was able to fool one of the most powerful Wizards alive)?

** Not exactly what you asked for but I read a fic where Snape survived and Harry asks him "What would have happened if i wasn't there to get the memories?" And Snape tells him that's what ghosts are for.

*** Except, nobody can guarantee whether someone will remain as a ghost or not. And the chances are most people don't remain as a ghost. So, that is left to chance still.

** Some universes feel so complete so that if one thing changed, you'd believe a similar (yet different) story would play out.

Some universes feel like a house of cards, where everything had to line up exactly for the plot. Usually if the dominos don't line up exactly either nothing interesting happens at all, or everything goes to hell and the only way it does not is a very specific set of events.

Harry Potter falls squarely into the second category. It is a house of cards.

Which is partially why time travel stories are fun in the universe.

** Two ways, either Dumbledore's portray or my personal favorite, the resurrection stone.

​

Imagine, the battle is raging on, maybe they even killed Nagini, only to see that Voldemort still doesn't die. Maybe even Ron and Hermine died already or are badly injured and will die soon if this doesn't end fast.

Harry is desperate and what more could be called 'in the end'. So he takes out the snitch again and feverishly hopes that something happens.

And it does. A little stone appears. Harry isn't sure what exactly it is and how it should help him. But he trusts Dumbledore as he did in the second year when Flaweys brought him the hat. He holds the stone and wished for Dumbledore to appear to help him. And he does. with a sad smile Dumbledore greeds Harry and invites him to take a small walk with him.

For a moment they walk next to each other in silence. Harry just isn't sure what to ask first. And while Harry looked over to Dumbledore every few seconds. The old wizard just looked ahead.

Finally the first words that tumble out of his mouth are: 'I failed. I'm so sorry. I don't know what to do. I failed everybody. I failed you...'

'No my boy. You most definitely didn't fail anyone. Least of all me. What you did was so remarkable and extraordinarily brave. Far greater than anyone has the right to expect you to be.'

They walk out of the headmaster's office and through Hogwarts.

"The stone you hold there is something very unique. Do you know what it is?"

Harry thinks for a moment and looks at it again. 'It is that stone out of the fairytale. Isn't it? The one that can bring back the dead.'

'A shadow of them, yes.'

'So you are not really here. you can't help us fight.'

'No, I can just answer some questions.'

'What went wrong? Why is he not moral yet? We did it! We destroyed the Horcruxes... But still...'

'Harry.' Dumbledore said and stopped for the first time and looked at him. His eyes held a deep sadness. 'Years ago you asked me what happened in the night your parents died and Voldemort targetted you. Do you remember what I told you?'

Harry was confused for a moment. 'That my mum's love saved me.' How was that going to help? Did Harry had to find a way to turn love into a weapon? But how?

'Yes, but what else did I tell you?'

Something uncomfortable started to twist in his chest, even before he really understood what Dumbledore was talking about. He looked around. They stood in front of the bathroom that led to the chamber of secrets, where the basilisk was still lying. The basilisk that he had heard in the walls all those years before. It felt like something cold was spreading through his body.

"That a little bit of him was given to me that night...'

'I am so sorry Harry. I wish there was another way. I searched for it, but couldn't find it.' Tears shimmered in his eyes and for the first time, Harry really saw how old Dumbledore looked. Old, broken, powerless and sad.

'Oh...'

'I wish it wasn't your burden to bear.'

'I'm afraid...'

'Oh of course you are. But remember, you don't have to walk alone.'

'I can't take anyone with me. It is too dangerous.'

'For the living yes. But there are a lot of people here that are willing to walk next to you, as they always have, even if you couldn't see them anymore.'

*** Yes, something like this. Though, I would imagine Harry would be angrier. Harry considered it a betrayal in the canon when he learned what was expected of him but was resigned to his fate. In a direct conversation I would imagine he would be angrier even if he would still do the necessary deed.

*** Except, there is no backup plan in canon. I know it could be done as you said but it is not how it is. There is no way for the information to be delivered to Harry. Which is the premise I want to be explored. Harry without the information needed to push him to self sacrifice. What he will do and what will happen without that.

** Oh my...that would be interesting to write. I've never read a fic that did this but I'm envisioning a story similar to The Lovely Bones, where Severus, stuck in the in-between, has to guide Harry to end Voldemort.

*** Possibly, or even better Harry believes that the Horcruxes are destroyed and confronts Voldemort as he does in the Great Hall in canon. Since Harry is fighting back and is the master of the elder wand, the killing curse rebounds and kills Voldemort. Voldemort's shade flees and Harry realises there is atleast one more Horcrux to deal with. Death eaters without their master abandon the battle, but knowing he is alive try to bring him back. Harry stumbles around in order to find the final Horcrux by putting together clues or maybe even Dumbledore's portrait wakes up and finally has to tell Harry what he has to do directly. Wonder how that will go.
