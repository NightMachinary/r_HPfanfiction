Hey guys, I have a weird question. What ever happened to the Dragon Figurine that Harry pulled out of the bag? the mini Hungarian Horntail. Cuz that little thing was adorable in the movies... any thoughts?


** I...have no idea, but now I want to see a fic where Harry has to keep it and care for it and carry it around in his pocket, like a Gigapet that's alive and breathes fire....

*** A very long time ago (10 to 15 years), I remember reading a fic in which the dragon was in a pet-like position - I remember Hermione going into Harry's dorm and asking it where Harry was. I have no idea why that in particular stuck in my head. Possibly because I don't think I've ever seen the mini-dragon mentioned in a fic since.

** Harry kept it by his bedside at first. If it functioned like Ron's mini-Krum, it probably stopped moving around after a while and ended up tossed into Harry's trunk. Alternately it could be that it grew a bit larger and rather bored, so Harry sold it off to the bloke running the dragon-roasted chestnuts pram in the sixth movie.

** Didn't Ron set it on his mini-Krum, sometime around breaking off mini-Krum's legs? It's been a LONG time since I've read GoF (that should be my next reread), so I'm probably wrong, but I think that was the last time it was mentioned.

*** After the Yule Ball Harry saw the figurine had a broken arm and assumed ron did it on purpose.
