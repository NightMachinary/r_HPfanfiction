I was wondering if anybody could help me? if any of you know a fanfic like the one I'm looking for it would be great if I could get some feedback.

I'm looking for a fanfic where Sirus and Remus look after an older Harry (4th year and up) and Harry is in danger or gets kidnapped or something like that and obviously, Remus and Sirius are panicking.

I have read disappearing and reappearing which is something along those lines so I do recommend that.

thanks ahead
