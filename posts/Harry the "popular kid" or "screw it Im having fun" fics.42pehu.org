Are there any pretty good fics of Harry being the popular guy/party animal/or just saying "fuck it Im going to have fun!" during or post Hogwarts? I don't really care about genre or pairing, slash and smut is fine too.

I was thinking along the lines of *A Black Comedy* or *We'll All Fall after the Yule Ball* because it was fun to follow Harry's antics and reap the rewards or consequences (in the case of Yule Ball specifically). I've seen the angst/emo trope a thousand times, so the idea of Harry being more like James/Sirius with his attitude and actions feels refreshing.

Do you guys like ooc Harry fics like this or do you think it's better to stay true to JKcanon?


** I'd say just watch [[http://youtu.be/wmwM_AKeMCk][A Very Potter Musical]] because that essentially the Harry and story you have described. ðŸ˜‹

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

** A lot of stuff by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/686093/Rorschach-s-Blot][Rorschach's Blot]] is enjoyable. He's not the best technical writer, but he has great ideas.

linkffn(Make A Wish by Rorschach's Blot) is probably his most well known and is the beginning of a series of fics.

linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes by nonjon) is by the same author of A Black Comedy and quite good as well. Firefly crossover, so be forewarned.

edit: Posted to the wrong place. Still, both are 'screw it i'm having fun' style. Enjoy!

**** Browncoat, Green Eyes has a bit of a change of pace part of the way through, so if you find yourself not really enjoying the story after (I'm phrasing this so it's not a spoiler but you'll know the point I mean) Harry gets his hands on an endless supply of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, it's probably best to give it up there. I didn't finish it myself, and the last few chapters I read I didn't really enjoy since the premise changed a lot.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Blazin Goblet)

Wherein Harry smokes pot a bit too much and throws wise one-liners around.

It's one of the most hilarious stories I have read. Trust me, very few others will have you grinning as much as this one. As a plus, it is not actually a crackfic.

** I like OOC Harry like this because it gives you more space to play with regarding fanfiction. Canon Harry will always react like canon Harry to whatever threat an author can come up with, which is cool and all, but it can make "new" stories fairly predictable or frustrating. Predictable when you know Harry as a character would ONLY rush into the cave to defeat the monster and save the damsel, frustrating if he's been canon up to that point and then doesn't.

Anyway, you want a "fuck it" Harry? Try linkffn(Where in the world is Harry Potter) and it's sequels. Bordering on crack fic, but fairly great.
