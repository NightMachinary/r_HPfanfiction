*** you know when you are a kid and a grown up plays "got your nose"? Yeah, some kid in the muggle orphanage did that with Tom, not knowing how horrible the consequences are for magical children. That's really why Tom hates muggles.

** Ginny had all her life wanted to marry Harry Potter. Of course, even when she was little, she knew that you don't just get to marry Harry Potter - you had to be very, very special to do that. And, being not as arrogant as Malfoy, she knew she had to work hard to get there.

Ginny had never read a story where the evil guy had disappeared before the story even began. Harry Potter's life was clearly worthy of a story - she had read all the books about him. Therefore, You-Know-Who must still be alive, biding his time only to return at Harry Potter's most vulnerable.

So, to earn the right to marry Harry Potter, Ginny would defeat You-Know--Who with a special hex she would invent herself.

Thus, the Bat-Bogey was born.

​

Some years later, when Voldemort returns without a nose...

Ginny: "NOOOOOO!"
