I made a post about my OC Jane Heavens and now I decide to make a post about her maternal family, the Filliesters

As stated in the other post, the Filliesters are a wealthy and taller family than the Malfoys in the wizarding hierarchy. Filliesters are a powerful family and their members are trained from an early age to reach their level of power. Even if they don't get the best grades, try to beat them in a duel.

They have different positions in the wizarding world and perform all in the best way. There are journalists, aurors, teachers and even Ministers of Magic

They are not blood-purists, but they once were and are ashamed of that past. Some married Muggles and Muggle-borns

At Hogwarts, the Filliesters were also very popular and there were many prefects in the family.

But they also have their mistakes. The pressure placed on children to be good and better than their ancestors sometimes makes them insecure when they don't feel good enough

The Filliesters also have a motto "Never break a promise". Breaking a promise is considered a maximum dishonor. When a Filliester turns 10, they take an oath that is "Never become a Death Eater, never disrespect your peers and inferiors, be a good person and never break a soul's promise"

A soul promise is a soul-deep promise. Isn't it "promise you help me with the job?" is "Promise you will never betray me and stab me in the back?"

Breaking the oath is the ultimate, unforgivable dishonor and when a Filliester is born, a spell is cast on him to let everyone know when he broke the oath. The oath got know as "The Filliester´s Oath".

Once a Filliester became a Death Eater and he was rejected by his entire family. But he did not want their forgiveness. He tried to kill his Auror cousin and ended up killed by the same. The Death Eater was hidden and the family tried to get rid of him and they acted as if he never existed for the rest of the world and he was removed from the family tree.

If you have any questions about them, ask on the comments and I´ll answer
