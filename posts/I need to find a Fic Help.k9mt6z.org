:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So, I've just spent an hour and a half searching the web for a fic. I need help.

Here's what I know:

- Harry has a little sister, Rose, who was something something frozen in time
- she can do really cool magic
- harry's grandparents were frozen in a painting and are raising rose
- harry's living with them too (I think)
- Lots of other characters from an unknown source
- ron and the weasleys are not in the friend circle
- theres a Japanese? character from another dimension (dystopian magic clone)
- she has magic crystals on her arms and her name starts with a C
- she exorcises Binns, meets Bill weasley, and they get a new history teacher (shes cool)
- she starts a dojo in a hidden wing of Hogwarts accessed through a painting
- her grandfather was friends with dumbledore
- the Sorting hat is called Sir Alistaire and all main characters know this
- there is a village of Squibs who send some kids to hogwarts (one of thems lesbian)
- there's a scene where Mystery Girl and rose summon lightning? (and scare mrs weasley)
- there's a scene where rose uses a crucio on a dark mark? and rescues some other character
- there's a scene where rose sends the weasleys a howler and it breaks things
- the house table rules are thrown out the window
- harry WILL NOT join the quidditch team unless other first years can try out too
- oh all the main characters have shrinking luggage
- unfinished, old, lots of chapters and good worldbuilding

Please help me find this awesome fic! I think it starts with a W.
