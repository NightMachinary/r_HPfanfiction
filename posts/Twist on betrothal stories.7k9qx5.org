Considering there's plenty of fanfics where Harry is entered into a betrothal either through inheritance or through the fact his parents somehow decided to enter him into one before age 1, I wonder what the interest would be in a story where Harry comes into his inheritance from either the Black family, some random magical event activating a betrothal from the Peverell family from way back in the 1200's, or some random circumstance causing a Potter betrothal contract to activate.

But instead of the expected prose where Harry meets his betrothed and they fall madly in love, what if instead he meets his betrothed, and they absolutely DESPISE one another.

They still marry, they still have kids due to the nature of the betrothal contract, but Harry's personality changes from this happy-go-lucky guy, to become rather spiteful of his bigoted/resentful/annoying wife, and he becomes a similar version to a Draco Malfoy.

Harry would go through life following the requirements of the betrothal in order to keep his magic (married by 18, kids by 20, male heir by 25 at the latest or some such...).

But since his wife is a horrible person he does anything he can to annoy her.

She hates the game of Quidditch? He becomes a professional player. She abhors muggleborns? He creates a company solely hiring muggleborns. She wants to become a standard pureblood housewife? He makes it utterly impossible for that to happen and makes a secretary of some muggleborn in his newly created company.

Stuff like that to make her life as miserable as she wants to make his miserable.

Maybe at first she thinks she can control him to be what she wants Harry to be as a Wizard and a man, but since he's had some bad experiences with manipulation (Dumbledore) he decides to have none of it and becomes one of the most political savvy men in the history of the Wizengamot, and uses all his influence to make her 'dream-world' come crashing down and does his absolute best to create a haven for muggleborns and muggle-raised like himself.

.

Just some random thoughts...


** Its not what you're after but have you read Legacy or The legacy/ whatever its called? A HP/DG that is far too long with far too little happening. While they are reasonably happy as the story heads to its conclusion its not sunshine and roses, they didn't moan for a week then have a happily ever after. There is none of the pettyness that you're after but if you're out of things to read then its not the worst thing on ffn.

*** While it is extremely long, I found it to be pretty interesting. The author has a lot of unique ideas and creates a pretty cool universe. She or he is especially nuanced in describing history and legislature. It can get a bit dry, but the characters are believable and there is real conflict in love and killing Voldemort.

  Last Heirs of noble bloodlines are forced to marry in order to prevent wizards from becoming extinct thanks to a new law passed by the Ministry in order to distract the public from listening to Dumbledore's warnings of Voldemort's return. Rated M, so once again if you are easily offended, just don't read it.

** Or maybe, what if /both Harry and his betrothed/ are /both/ good, average people, and they both just don't like that they are forced and bound by magic and laws to marry and so they both decide to try to make the best of the situation? They like each other and try to love each other, because they realize they are in the same boat, and so it becomes them against the world. :)

Why do you have to make his wife just some bigoted/spiteful/annoying /thing/ to be there for that reason to Harry, instead of a person in her own right who might just be as upset as Harry and might be just as good as him? I think that is called dehumanizing and making a living complex person into a plot device or an /obstacle/ with nothing else to her, and it is not good.

**** I disagree quite a bit here.

Stories about average people are everywhere, just not in the HP fandom (except maybe the OC/SI stories where the point is to insert a normal person in the HP world) so much seeing as most of the characters aren't what you could call "average" in our reality. Pretty much everyone is a bit extraordinary.

Sitcoms have been telling stories of average people for years and years and they've done pretty well at not boring people.

***** I shouldn't have worded my reply as a blanket statement covering all stories about average people, but I will say, in many sitcoms about "average" people (lets take friends as an example) they don't react to situations in an average way, and they are placed in an extraordinary situation to begin with. In other cases, people begin as "ordinary" (again they are nothing but) but become extraordinary people.

Anyway, instead of all stories, I really just meant HP fanfictions
