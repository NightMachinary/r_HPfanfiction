I'm looking for harry potter naruto crossovers. Good ones. Doesn't matter if Harry is Jashin, after becoming MoD. Or he is the shinigami sealing kurama in naruto.

#+begin_quote
  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

  Harry was never the only person with a penchant for tripping into the most absurd of situations. Reincarnated!Hermione. Somewhat darker than the usual take on Naruto. Political machinations. Character progression. Strong friendship, no romance.

** The two universes are extremely hard to mesh due to how different the worlds work. In Naruto, their bodies are their weapons. They use their given energies in order to fight. There is also not a concrete villain in Naruto. (In manga its considered that there are villain arcs. While western stories focus on one over arching villain). In Harry Potter's world, they fight using purely their wits and minds. If given enough time, everyone has the exact same arsenal, and winners are decided by quick thinking. In Naruto that is true yes, but just like humans, Narutoverse warriors are extremely diverse with differing arsenals, even among those who live in the same village.

This leads to the next issue; how do you incorperate the two? If we have Harry Potter in Naruto's world, he would grossly overwhelmed by the sheer physicality of the fighting. I personally think that a genin would be capable of dodging a killing curse and killing the person who sent it if that genin was properly trained. Yet if a Narutoverse character were to go into the HP Universe, then the same problem arises. How do you keep a character like Kakashi (HighJonin-Kage level shinobi, who is not even close to the strongest character in the Narutoverse) from over powering even Voldemort? Sure you can bring in other shinobi, but that would cause interactional issues.

Both of these series are the most active fandoms on the internet. And upon looking at the characters, Naruto and Harry are eerily similar. Both were abused by their caregivers, forced to defend a world that takes advantage of them in some way, and are in all due likelyhood the most dangerous people alive in their worlds in the end of the story. (I am not counting Boruto since that series is not even close to being done, and honestly there isnt a character there that can beat Naruto in a fight. Period) They both also gain their abilities through sheer hard work and perseverance. Annoyingly enough, they also both marry their "fangirl". (I am a naruhina shipper however. Hinata is the only one I could see actually putting up with Naruto) There are other story significances, the most notable being the first major character death in each series. (I speak of the third Hokage and Cedric respectively) It is only after these two deaths that we see that the world is not full of good guys winning. There are other deaths before in each series (Haku/Zabuza and Quirellimort) but both did not ease the light heartedness that each series had up until the two deaths mentioned above.

Those are the difficulties and why in a previous post I said that there is no point in searching Fanfiction.net with those two universes crossed over. However,that being said here are some recommendations. linkffn(6604850) this story explores if Harry was found by naruto. Have not gotten around to reading. it is on my list.

linkffn(4044086) this story is a personal favorite of mine. It is set mainly in the Narutoverse, which is in my opinion, easier to scale the characters to.

linkffn(A Personal Matter by Ordruin) the prequal to the story above by the same author, it is in my opinion superior due to the orginality of the story and the age of Kakashi.

I hope that tides you over. All are complete, and all are commonly considered the best. Ja Ne!

EDITS random period at the beginning.. lol
