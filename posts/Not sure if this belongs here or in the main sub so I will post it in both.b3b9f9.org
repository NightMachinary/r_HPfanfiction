** I'm not sure if it's canon or fanon that has McGonagall introducing muggleborns and their families to magic, but if it is canon, then she's been doing for 39 years as of 1995. I'd say she's definitely aware of muggle ideas.

Also, this stuff is retcon or something, but her father is a muggle minister. So, as a halfblood, she ought to have a foot in both worlds.

I am pretty sure it is fanon but canon never specifically denies it and it makes a lot of sense.

** I think she knows enough to comfortably meet and talk with muggles but her sense of fashion is probably a bit out of date considering that she spends most of her time at hogwarts and probably only goes into the muggle world a few times a year.

** According to [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall]] she's a half-blood with a Muggle father. She mostly grew up in the muggle world and her early romantic relationship was also with a Muggle. From what I can gather she went mostly into the magical world after that (around her early twenties probably).

The only Muggle interaction we directly see in the books is McG watching the Dursleys in book 1 and commenting that they are the worst sort of Muggles (which means she likely has at least some way to compare).

All in all I'd say she has pretty good muggle knowledge, albeit maybe a bit outdated in the cultural parts you are referencing.
