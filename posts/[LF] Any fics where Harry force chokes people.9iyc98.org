There are any stories with Harry going ham and choking bitches, I want him to use it liberally.


** At first I thought this was a weird sexual thing but do you mean like legit just depriving people of breath cause they being a Bitch?

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/][The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(9863146): He wandlessly choked Fudge when the latter refused to acknowledge Voldemort's return, along with the line “I find your lack of faith disturbing”.

#+begin_quote
  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.
