Looking for something similar to (Forging the sword) and (The sum of their parts), basically they face challenges together and are really best friends. Pairings are optional.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Walked-on-Water][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water]], linkffn(12076771): It's a crossover that should not have worked, but is nevertheless very entertaining. The Trio is in a romantic relationship, and their families are not happy about it.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is set in a non-magical world. If you can get past that, it's an excellent read. The Trio is even tighter than in canon. For example, when Harry's name got entered in the Tournament, all three were blamed by the rest.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7405516/1/We-are-the-Golden-Trio][We are the Golden Trio!]], linkffn(7405516): The plot and characterizations are pretty good, writing quality is not, but I still like this story a lot.

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.
