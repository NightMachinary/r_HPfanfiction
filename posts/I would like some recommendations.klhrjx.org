I would like some story's where harry is not exactly human being involved with inhuman beings will also be good.


** Here's one of my fics. The title should tell you whether the premise is close enough to what you're looking for. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24841198/chapters/60090274]]

Beyond that, I'm afraid your request is too vague to help you further. (Also this should be flaired Request, not Recommendation).

** Is Harry and Fleur okay? Then read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8135514/1/His-Angel][His Angel]]. There's a bit of veela history and such too.
