Looking for fics that contain eye rolling "there problem gone" or other fics that invoke powers they know not.

Most things overpowered. Not necessarily crack.

Ie Luna in the fic always the quiet ones. Turns out she knows more than what was realised..

Not necessarily limited to luna, but she is the ideal candidate for this.

Bonus points for eldritch horrors or fae, looking out for things that invoke horrors that lovecraft dreamed up.

Have hunted around a few fanfiction websites but haven't come across anything that can compare to luna in this:

Cheers!


** i once read a fic where luna goes to a lovecraftian parallel dimension? and is hunted by surreal monsters (one of them based on lily), unfortunately i cant remember the name...

*** I seem to remember something on FFN where Luna was wandering through a Lovecraftian nightmare world. That might be the story you're thinking of... I think it was called "The Eyes", but I can't seem to find it.

I am sure I've seen the one you mention somewhere recently. Maybe ao3. Google has a few more answers than I expected but most are shitty slash or pairings.
