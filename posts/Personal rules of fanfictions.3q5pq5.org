What are some of your rules when reading fanfictions that either make the fic work, or makes you sigh with disappointment.

Mine would be that female harry, or sister of Harry must have a name based on a flower


** If Harry is a bird animagus, I'm like alriiiight. If he's a Phoenix animagus I'll abandon the fic no matter how good it was or how far into it I was.

** Angst ruins the fic, unless angst is the reason for Harry to self-improve and stop being angsty. Same with RIGHTEOUS ANGER WRITTEN IN ALL-CAPS, which is pretty much angst anyway.

** POV changes must be clear. Either through formatting or writing style.

New magic must be explained in a decent way.

Magical Core Power levels have a home within animes, not HP fanfiction. The original magic of HP was not limited by a "ressource pool" so to say, but just by focus, intent, emotion and knowledge as well as the age of the caster. While magical cores are ok in general, they have no business of becoming the central part of a fic.

No sex before the age of (at least) 15. Written out sex scenes not under the age of (at least) 17, ideally 18. Under that age its only ok if by some miracle the author made it relevant to the story.

Magical creature animagi are stupid.

A 14 year old does not single-handedly destroy the machinations of a experienced manipulator. If he could, people would already have done so.

Hogwarts schoolyear recaps are boring in general. There has to be a truly good reason for me to even glance twice at it.

** Mpreg. Genderbending. Alpha/omega bullshit. I don't even go past the summaries on those.

I'm also not a fan of certain ships - any teacher/student (like can we not with Snape/Hermione), Hagrid/anyone, Voldemort/anyone, Lucius/Draco's skull, etc.

Things that do work for me: Drarry, Dramione (shh), "eighth-year" fics (students in Harry's year get a do-over of their shitty seventh year), post-war fics. I don't tend to read things that take place during the books - JK Rowling already wrote that well enough imo!

** I wouldn't say personal rules so much as personal tastes, but I don't generally like stories that involve the main characters going to Hogwarts, which is a right shame because about 90% of all HP fics feature Hogwarts in some form or another. I just find them boring.

I'm okay with it when it comes to romance though, because that is less about the plot and more about the characters, so the setting of the story takes somewhat of a back seat.

** No bashing that comes out of left field and is clearly there because the author hates the canon character. Some bashing is allowed if it fits the story and isn't too obvious.

Ron bashing is an immediate exit though. I'm tired of people hating Ron, why can't they hate Fred and George for a while?

*** Fully agreed or actually hate the characters we are meant to hate like Bellatrix and Snape and Draco who get turned into woobies. Fumbled ore bashing Weasley bashing and turning Hermione into a flawless goddess oh and giving Harry unexplained ultra mega powers are instant exit reasons for me.

**** See, Snape was written really well throughout the series so I could see how people sympathize with him. And Draco was really pitiful.

Don't know why people like Bellatrix though. Maybe they like villains?

Also, Dumbledore bashing really depends on the story. If it's seriously AU I can understand, but not if it's close to canon.

Ron bashing, unless Ron is not longer Ron, is an immediate exit.

***** Oh I agree Snape was an amazing Anti Hero and I love to hate him, but so many fans seen he'll end on making him this perfect Saint who always got bullied by the Marauders and was always the victim. Snape was bullied yes but knew how to defend himself he knew more dark spells in first year than most seventh years and yes the Marauders were dicks but Snape did join Voldie and drove Lily away. He is such a complex character too often gets robbed of this complexity especially in Snape Centric Marauder fics where Sirius suddenly becomes a rapist.

Also I like Draco but everything they are criticizing in Ron is there in Draco ten fold and they defend him to death I don't get it.

I can recommend

*Depth of a Heart by MIsts* It's a series of one shots showing Deathly Hallows from Rona point of view and giving us a great view into his thought and we get to see him struggle ad grow.

To be fair, there is a canon explanation; All the Evans (Lily's family before James) females are named after flowers, stands to reason that Lily would keep the tradition if they had a daughter.

** In a serious fic, Harry and Voldemort are the only ones allowed to act OOC. Unless it's a complete AU.

Showing the POV and thoughts of anyone other than the protagonist ruins the story's experience.
