I don't care about the pairing, as long as it's Harry/female of about his age (Tonks is just about the oldest). NO SLASH Thanks! Ps. To walk a mile in someone else's shoes is known by me

*** not really, you can say that at 22 because frankly 28 year olds (unless they already have kids, maybe!) aren't that much more mature than you are and 16 year olds aren't all that less mature (especially if you talk about a boarding school environment where parents aren't around, kids have to grow up faster in that environment! They may not leave school fully formed adults, but they are in most cases closer than people who haven't been to boarding schools - NOTE: I am no praising boarding schools, I frankly don't know if I like the concept or not, as I've never been to boarding school!)

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.
