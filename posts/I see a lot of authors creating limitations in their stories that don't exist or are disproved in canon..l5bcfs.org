Like, there is no mention of magical cores or magical exhaustion in canon. That is a fanon-created limitation that is really unnecessary.

Transfiguration is not said in canon to be temporary. There are no shown examples of a time limit to transfiguration. And speaking of which, that brings me to another one that's relatively minor but one I'd like to see more of, which is that you can't transfigure something into a magical creature. But that is ALSO wrong because Quintapeds exist. Now, regarding the myth about Quintapeds being created by using transfiguration on wizards and witches, rather than being a natural magical species, it doesn't matter whether or not it's true. What matters is that wizards and witches who understand the way transfiguration works think it /could/ be true, as shown by them sending Ministry wizards to attempt to untransfigure them. If wizards who understand transfiguration believe it possible to create magical animals with transfiguration, then it probably is possible.


** I personally don't have an issue with authors who want to explore magic within their stories, and give details on how it works, limitations, etc. Even if those rules aren't canonical, as long as the magical rules are internally consistent within the story, I think that's fine.

I mean, it's not like Rowling really delves into exactly how magic works in HP. She gives us some spells, a few rules, some wand lore, some magical objects, but that's about it. She even introduces school subjects where it's not entirely clear what their use and purpose is. What is Arithmancy? Is it used for predicting the future? Is it used for creating new spells? Is it just complex math? Where does the “magic” come in?

In fact, some of the stories in the HP fandom that I have enjoyed the most have really fleshed out how magic worked in Harry Potter.

(To be fair, I'm a huge geek about this stuff. The stories about Recluce from L.E. Modesitt are some of my favorite fantasy books, and those novels are chock full with exploring magic and how it works.)

Now, for authors who just drop non-canonical magical details in their stories just because the plot needs to get from point A to point B...I'm kind of noncommittal about it. If it makes at least /some/ sense within the context of the story and the story is overall well-written and enjoyable, I don't have a huge issue with it.

If, however, it's silly and nonsensical, like “OMG, Harry Potter can summon dragons now!”, I have less patience with it. However, those types of stories tend to be bad for a whole host of other reasons too.

So, in summation, I think exploring “magic” within Harry Potter is generally either a good thing or a neutral thing (regardless of whether it is canonical or non-canonical), at least in the hands of good authors.

** It's pretty much the standard dis-satisfaction with Rowling-Magic and the conflict between Hard and Soft Magic kicking in. A lot of people subscribe to Sanderson's rules - one of which is that magic is only as interesting as its limitations (because if there's no reason not to assume your character can wave a hand and solve any problem, there's bugger all in the way of dramatic tension).

Mental and physical fatigue don't satisfy people who think that sort of thing because they're personal limitations, not limitations in the magic itself (and subsequently, IMO, are much harder to use). You can practice to overcome the former and exercise to overcome the latter. Limitations to the magic are things that magic simply can't do - create real love, create good food, etc. - and Rowling's toolkit doesn't have very many major ones beyond ''If you want to do something, there has to be a spell made for it and you have to know and practice said spell, which is difficult enough that most magicals don't bother'. Rowling's magical toolkit is incredibly powerful and versatile, so a lot of people like to introduce new elements to curtail that.

Those new elements often come across as discordant because Rowling's magic isn't a system. The rules we see are pretty idiosyncratic and broken regularly (eg. the case of Wizard Baruffio and the Buffalo, and the idea that you have to practice and learn theory and be careful to pronounce spells correctly, being ignored when Harry casts Sectumsempra with no idea how to pronounce it or what it even does). And apparently good food can't be conjured - but we (from what I see of discussions on the matter in this sub, anyway) have absolutely no idea why and nothing else in the toolkit leads us to assume that. Learning new spells (and adding new elements) in Rowling-magic is like buying a new tool for your toolbelt, and you can't infer the existence of a hammer if all you have are screwdrivers and wrenches.

Personally, I don't think magical cores (or temporary transfiguration, for that matter) are the right answer to the quest for interesting systemic limitations - for all they're helpful and easy to use, batteries aren't particularly interesting - but they're a popular one that lots of people attempt.

**** It's the same thing that puts people like Stephen Hawking or Usain Bolt above the rest of us. Being good at Magic is like being good at Maths, or Tennis, or Drawing. Innate talent and synergistic qualities (attributes that influence each other - eg. if you're naturally dextrous or have a talent for footwork, that'll make you a more skilled dancer if you put the work into learning that), hard work and interest in a subject, and general intelligence and drive. Everyone can become powerful, they just need to work at it (moreso if it's an area they're not talented at) and since Magic is so hard, not many people bother beyond the basics.

Dumbledore is a powerful Wizard because he had a natural talent for magic and the drive and intelligence to capitalise on that talent and a hundred years of practice to get to the point we see him at.

No, seriously, what?

The torture curse works by firing off the pain receptors in the person's body from what I can tell, all the pain receptors, at once and for as long as the spell is maintained at a level dependant on the caster, that's why it's /torture/. The only thing I remember of canon that has it affecting the brain is an indirect knock on effect from the brain retreating from too much pain and information overload coming in from the pain receptors and maybe the other sensitivity nerves like temperature and pressure.

Other mind effect spells like compulsions might be viable, or spells that might muck around with the brain's activity/chemistry like an electrical based spell might cause a memory charm to misfire if the brain is still randomly firing neurons from the initial discharge screwing the body's baseline bio-electrical levels or something firing off a lot of some chemical into the brain like dopamine could cause issues with mind affecting spells until it clears, not a torture curse.

This is the effect of the Boggart-Dementor, not the Patronus. We know this because:

1. Lupin tells us Dementors drain wizards of their powers.

2. Lupin gives Harry chocolate to get rid of the feeling, which is the remedy for Dementor exposure.

3. When Harry casts the Patronus and Dementors are /not/ present, he does not experience the feeling of being drained/tired. This is even explicitly noted in the time when Harry cast the Patronus against Draco Malfoy pretending to be a Dementor - he tells Lupin that, to his surprise, he felt nothing.

In addition, in GoF Harry repeatedly casts the Summoning Charm non-stop from dinner until after midnight and, far from experiencing magical exhaustion, his spell actually improves over this period of time. He is physically tired from staying up late working, but not in any sense /magically/ tired.

** Magical cores and exhaustion is a matter of another discussion (and I don't think they are that big deal anyway). However, permanent transfiguration being rare or non-existent is extremely important. If you make transfigurations permanent then you completely destroy any logic of the world. Why there would be Madam Malkins, when all clothes can be transfigured? Why to have most craftsman? Why to go to work? If you think about it for longer time, you see that the permanent transfiguration is very dangerous. Fanfiction authors, when thinking about it, in silent agreement (or not so silent, that's probably the only thing where I agree with HPMoR) made transfigurations less devastating to their sanity.

** My opinion on magical cores vs no cores argument is somewhere in the middle, as while i prefer that there is no inborn difference between peoples ability to use magic that is often shown in fanfiction that feature cores, having magic as a external limitless mystical force that for some reason wizards can harness without explanation can seem a bit whimsical.

So when it comes to magical cores I always prefer to think of them as a focus point for natural magic, rather than something that generates magic. Say magic is everywhere in the environment and what separates magical's from muggles is that their bodies naturally absorb magic which coalesces into a certain point in their body before being distributed to the rest of them. In this instance, the core is not physical and should have very little to do with how overall powerful someone naturally is but 'magical exhaustion' could be caused by simply trying to use more magic than you can absorb at any given time, and perhaps over time your body will adapt to the strain to either draw magic in faster or store more for later use. This would lead to very little variation between peoples natural ability, but would definitely explain why those who spend years increasing their magical knowledge and skill (like Dumbledore and Voldemort) would naturally become more powerful than those who after graduating school go on to do everyday jobs like working in administration at the ministry.

Having a higher degree of intelligence and willpower would also work on how well you can /control/ your magic which would be why both Dumbledore and Voldemort became so overwhelmingly powerful.

Genius intellect + Constant effort to increase magical knowledge and skill = Amazing control with larger resources of magic to call upon.

It thoroughly disproves the idea that power comes from having a long chain of Wizarding ancestry, yes, but not the basic principle of some mages being naturally stronger.

Just the fact that genetics means some people have magic - massive extra capability with no apparent downside - and some don't, is a clear example of "some people are naturally more talented than others, regardless of fairness or worthiness." Canon /enforces/ that idea of dividing people into superior and lesser races based on genetics. Do you ever see the good guys argue that the Statute of Secrecy needs to be taken down? No, you don't. They just argue against the flawed blood status discrimination amongst those who have magic.

And apparently JKR's statements on the subject of Dudley's child having magic were to the effect that Vernon's DNA would squash any chance of that. Apparently your genetics can not just make you magical, they can also taint you and suppress the possibility.

That's why the books focused on how wrong and evil it was for muggleborns to be discriminated against but didn't address wizards' discrimination against muggles. It stayed at the level where it's bad if evil people do it (like the Black family or DE), but it's funny when a good guy like Ron confunds his driving instructor.

** Some writers, including myself, are more interested in creating a consistent story than Rowling was. Magic has to have more limitations than there are told to be in the Harry Potter books in order for the story to make sense internally.

About magical cores. If magic had limitless power to violate physics, the Harry Potter world would look very different. One example: if you used the Levitating Charm and pointed your wand to the ground, the Earth would become weightless and plunge into the outer space, killing all life. Are you seriously saying that such a thing just hasn't happened yet? I like the concept of magical core as long as it's not used as an excuse to make the main character super powerful. I think its function is to limit a wizard's power, not the other way around.

To be fair, there are spells that can Untransfigure objects. Imagine if a wizard Transfigures their entire outfit and then randomly gets hit by an Untransfiguration spell at some point. Sure, you could try to use protective enchantments to prevent that, but it's still a risk.

I like to think that wizards still purchase things due to (but not limited to):

- The risk of getting their Transfigured objects reverted/Untransfigured.

- The novelty of buying something, as well as the social image of letting people know where you bought it (especially if it's a high-class store). They may be wizards and all, but they're still people at the end of the day.

- The difficulty of actually Transfiguring something yourself, as mentioned in another comment here. Not everyone is great at this branch of magic (hell, some don't even take it past O.W.L. level).

*** Not having a magical core, not having a finite supply of magic, is not the same as having the power to do anything you want. Spells themselves have limitations, based not necessarily on power but on skill, knowledge, and familiarity with the spell. You think not having a magical core means someone could try and levitate the earth? That's ridiculous and a nonsensical argument.

I never liked the idea of magical power as a measurement of a limited resource. I like it more as a descriptor for the combined knowledge and skill of a wizard or witch. It's also why I dislike multiple shield spells. The protego charm can protect against multiple spells because it's literally the concept of protection in spell form. Magic is flexible and can be adjusted on the fly by a wizard with sufficient skill and knowledge. Case in point, Harry uses Protego as a shield against spells, against summoning, against legilimency, and to act as a barrier between Ron and Hermione that physically pushes them back.

Also, we are shown quite frequently that transfiguration is a difficult skill to learn and master. The idea that any average witch or wizard could transfigure up whatever they needed a given time is wrong. Physical products are necessary BECAUSE not everyone has the skill to transfigure what they need. There is nothing in canon that says gold can not be transfigured. At the very least, it seems possible to conjure silver as Voldemort conjured a silver shield during his battle with Dumbledore. The only thing I can speculate is that it might be one of the exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration.

** On the flip side, a lot of authors miss limitations that /are/ present canonically (even if it's from secondary canon like Pottermore): Veritaserum can be resisted, for example, and as such isn't an infallible method of determining (what the subject believes to be) the truth.

** Isn't the point of fanfiction that it isn't canon? Canon doesn't need those limitations because magical power or warfare doesn't really come into play there. Limitations can often make magic much more colorful and interesting, and less of an amorphous blob of intent, as it is described in books 5+.

** ...or we can just let people write the stories they want to write and move on to something else if we don't like it. FFS. The audacity of people on this sub that think they get to tell authors what people should and should not put in their own damn stories is genuinely mind boggling.

** I'm completely against permanent Transfiguration, it's extremely OP and Broken, other than that I love reading how each author finds a way to explain Rowling's undeveloped system

*** Methods of Rationality takes the view that permanent Transfiguration is the power of the Philosopher's Stone. It grants a kind of immortality because you can transfigure away any disease or injury and then make that permanent. And making gold is an obvious application.

** I have no problem with it really. I think its cool to see authors create their own magic lore, and original spells, potions, etc.
