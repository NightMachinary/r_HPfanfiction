I'm pretty sure this is a good idea, helped along by a bit of alcohol. I want a story where the Power He Knows Not is One For All. Lily is Harry's Nana Shimura and at the Battle of Hogwarts he fuckin annihilates Voldemort with the United Kingdom Smash after Lily gives him a last second boost via the sacrificial protection.

"That's because I didn't put my wand into it that time!"

Don't pretend you don't want to watch My Wizard Academia right now. Ron can be Bakugo I guess


** Ahah that would be a magnificent mess! Makes me think of the One Punch Man/HP crossover

#+begin_quote
  When the Dursleys die in a car crash, Dumbledore is left with a quandary as to where to place the Boy-Who-Lived. That is, until he remembers another relative of Lily's: a cousin in Japan. Rated M just be safe.
