She can still be friendly with people like Luna and Hermione and the others, but I'd rather that Ginny spends time with O.C. characters who are also Gryffindors in the same year as her. HBP implies that Ginny is popular/has her own group of friends besides Neville and Luna, so I'd like to see that explored. Canon compliant fics are preferred, but I'd read an AU as long as it's well written. Please don't rec The Changeling since it has Slytherin!Ginny.

  CoS according to Ginny. Nobody noticed anything wrong for an entire year -- how did she slip so far from her family and friends? Angst and betrayal, but also mysteries, jokes, an enchanted suit of armor, and a guaranteed happy ending.
