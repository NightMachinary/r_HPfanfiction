Fic(s) that potrayed Dumbledore as manipulative/evil/selfish/etc. I'm trying to find either good fics that characterize Dumbledore in that way, and hopefully figure out what caused the characterization for a paper.


** [[https://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Sunset_Over_Britain/index][Sunset Over Britain]] is the earliest one I remember reading. It was completed before HBP was published.

The details are kind of fuzzy, but I remember some manipulative Dumbledore and Weasley bashing. Bobmin wrote in an A/N that it was an experiment for them to write an H/Hr story contrary to their usual style. The tropes in the story are pretty developed, so Manipulative Dumbledore was probably an established motif by then.

Do note that since the story predates HBP and DH, the source of Dumbledore bashing stems more from his concealing the prophecy, leaving Sirius in prison and Harry with the Dursleys, letting Quirrell/Lockhart/Binns/Crouch Jr. teach, etc.

Later fics further justify bashing using The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, his lust for the Hallows, 'the greater good', his belief that Harry must die, love potion Ginny & Molly, etc.

A lot of Dumbledore bashing has some basis in the source material. Harry's frustration at Dumbledore in most of OotP and throughout DH gives authors a springboard for more extreme reactions.

** I don't know if there's be a specific fic that sparked it. Completely anecdotally (so wait and see if there's some consensus), one of my first thoughts while reading the series was "damn, these teachers don't do shit." [[https://youtu.be/qieKUcgm-2E?t=8m34s][And this video shows it's not exactly an unpopular sentiment]].

If that's a common sentiment, then that could cause the characterization.

If you're looking for manipulative Dumbledore fics, Robst's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8186071/1/Harry-Crow][Harry Crow]] has that. Personally, I don't think it's well written, but it certainly is popular with 15,000+ favorites and 12,000+ follows.
