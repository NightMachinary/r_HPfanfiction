:END:
Harry leaves the Wizarding World with Teddy and goes to Forks he also has 'Basilisk eyes', and sets up a bar (both alcoholic and non) and has the wolves and Bella with some of her friends work there. He calls Bella 'Hells Bells'. Towards the end (I think, idk if its completed) They go on a cruise with the Voltari (they were in the fic before this too). Bella gets pregnant from one of the Voltari. Also from what I remember Ron was abusive to Hermione and she goes to Harry with her kids, soon Harry beats Ron while on the cruise. I think I have a lot of info on the fic I just cant find it.

Nevermind! Apparently I wasn't looking hard enough! I found it and it's called Stranger Happenings! Here is the link! [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5161756/1/Stranger-Happenings]]
