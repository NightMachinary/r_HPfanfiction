I've read too many fics lately where Dumbledore is, either through incompetence or malice, basically a Bad Guy. Frankly, even when the author intends for the guy to be good, I still don't like him. So, I'd like to read a few stories where Harry doesn't have to deal with him.

Whether Dumbledore is dead or Harry's just taken outside of his influence, I don't really mind.

Harry shouldn't be raised by the Dursleys for more than a few years, if at all. Bonus points if he gets yoinked off their doorstep in '81!

Crossovers are mostly fine, especially ASoIaF or Star Wars, but I'm not an anime fan.

If Harry ever meets Dumbledore, I'd prefer it not to be until the events of GoF at least, when he should be sensible enough not to rely on him too much.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11933512/1/The-House-of-Potter-Rebuilt][The House of Potter Rebuilt]] has a very different Year 1.

Harry and Lockhart solved most problems on their own in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate][When in Doubt, Obliviate]].

Harry was raised by Sirius in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922116/1/Gothic][Gothic]] and never went to Hogwarts. He hires Ginny to accompany him on some adventures after the war.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13618513/1/half-awake-and-almost-there][half awake and almost there]] is Muggle AU and a nice Harry/Ginny romance. Dumbledore and Voldemort don't exist here.

Finally, James and Lily get to raise Harry themselves in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]]. Dumbledore lives until 2015 in this fic, but he's completely overwhelmed by the turn of events and hopelessly outmatched by his adversaries. He can't even control rogue elements within his Order. He and Harry never met.
