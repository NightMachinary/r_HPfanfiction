  If there's one thing Rita Skeeter is good at, it's sniffing out a story, and when she sees a downtrodden Harry Potter at King's Crossing, by Merlin does she find a story! One that will change the face of the Wizarding World, Harry Potter, and even Rita herself. Harry was always more Slytherin than Gryffindor, really, and with someone to grow those traits...they won't see it coming.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

  Harry has been entered into the Triwizard Tournament against his will, and his friends don't believe him when he insists he didn't enter his name. Will Ginny Weasley sit by and watch him suffer alone, or will she risk exposing the dark secret she has been hiding. GoF re-write from Ginny's POV. Smart & slightly manipulative Ginny! Extreme Ron-bashing!
