I was looking for ffs that have James and Lily surviving and actually raising Harry. I'm not particular about ships or anything either. Thank you :)


** I remember asking for this on here and not getting many recs TT

Happy Jily raising Harry is too rare in comparison to Bad Parents! Jily and WBWL fics.

** The series of Batsutousai, [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/260551][Like a Ghost in My Town]], is really good. The second part of the series has Harry's parents alive as you want, but I don't know if you're up for it, it's a Tomarry story.

  Halloween 1981 and the Potter family has been attacked. But when Sirius arrives, the crib is empty. Harry is missing, presumed dead, but Mipsy knows the truth. She takes care of little master just as Lord Potter's portrait commands her to. Cover by EnchantedPixie495
