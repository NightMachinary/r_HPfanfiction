I've recently finished The Green Girl and I felt like Hermione in that series wasn't exactly acting like a Slytherin. I'm wondering if anyone knows any stories where someone acts brave, kind, and happy while being a Slytherin?

I'd prefer that house but anything would be cool.

Thanks!


** Most stories, including canon, are full of kids not acting like their assigned houses really. Whether that is by design or a side effect of bad writing, I couldn't say.

What I'd be interested in seeing is a (well-written) story where no one actually cares too much about houses in general and are just trying to get by as normal students. You know, until the shit hits the fan and these kids are thrust into a war as realistic young teens, not caricatures of a handful of qualities they had when they were 11.

To be fair, in /The Green Girl/, *nobody in Slytherin* was acting like a Slytherin.

*** Yeah, but I was thinking more like generally not acting like a a Slytherin. I can sorta get behind the house over blood thing.

I was looking more for something that would have Dumbledore seeing a kid being saved from some mishap in a class and saying "Ten points for... uhm.. /Slytherin/?"

** Does canon count as a story? Hermione flipped between Ravenclaw and Slytherin, with instances of Gryffindorism being comparatively rare.

  A collection of shorts covering the school years of a group of Slytherin students at Hogwarts. Voldemort might not be their primary concern, but that doesn't guarantee carefree times in the powerplays of the House of the ambitious and cunning.

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

** Linkffn(The Debt of Time)

Not sure if I linked properly, I'm new to Reddit, so if it didn't work, I'm sorry.

I pimp this fanfiction out to everyone, because it's just such a close love to me. Takes a little bit to get into the part that you're looking for, but once it gets there.. It's honestly great.

I have to say it's one of my all-time favorite Fanfictions.

Hermione does end up a Gryffindor, but with Slytherin-tendencies. :)

  FOUR PART SERIES - When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the Veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. (Pairings: HG/SB, HG/RL, and Canon Pairings) - Rated M for language, violence, and sexual scenes. *Art by Freya Ishtar*
