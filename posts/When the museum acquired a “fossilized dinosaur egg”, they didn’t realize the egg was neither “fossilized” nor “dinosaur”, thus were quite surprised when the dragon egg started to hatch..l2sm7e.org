**** Yes, but why? Rock and egg are pretty different substances. When dating a fossil, which is what you do with a fossil, the type of rock that the fossil is becomes important. So, why? Like, was the egg spelled so muggles wouldn't notice?

*** The story took place around 2012 or so. Harry was somehow trapped inside the museum (because plot) and comes out with the Dragon. The world saw it and immortalised on internet and named him 'Aegon Reborn'

**** The Daily Prophet reports that when Potter was asked what he would do with the hatchling, he said; /"I don't want it, I never have."/

Later that day, Potter presented the hatchling to Her Royal Highness. Bowing before her, he set the hatchling on the ground. /"Mah Queen."/
