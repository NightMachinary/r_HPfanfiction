Kinda like rogues bet, if anyone's read that one. Swearing, sex, au - whatever, is fine.


** I have had that idea for a while, a fic with no story just teens living Hogwarts.

But nobody would like to read it. They want action packed stories with meaningful characters and epic romances that span across 500k words. They dont want a comedy styled fic.

The problem with this fandom in particular is that they are not open to change. Thos community downvote slash within a second, how would you think they would react when someone writes a fic like you described?

"Oh its pedophilia as the teens are having sex with each other!" Or maybe "I dont like this fic very much. The jokes was very rude and made me feel like nothing"

Everyone is a snowflake in this day and age and will say that isnt how teens act, when they actually dont know how public schools in Britain act. There are no "jocks" or "cool" kids. Just people making fun of others and getting into trouble a lot. Breaking rules about uniform things like that.

Not an epic fantasy with Harry becoming 15 lords, that isnt an accruate representation. Maybe just maybe a fic like Rouge's Bet is completed somewhere but I doubt it.

And writing fanfiction isnt about who views it, but how you change the community.
