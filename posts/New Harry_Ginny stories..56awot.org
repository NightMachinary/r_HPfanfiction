Harry/Ginny is my favorite pairing and I have read quite a bit of it. I'm looking for recommendations for stories started in the past year or so.

****** SIYE is certainly great, and so supportive - it would be awesome to see you publishing there! Are you not tempted by the challenge?

Which one? I don't have any WIPs at the moment, but I do have fics coming up.Not sure when they will be at a stage ready to be posted though as I'm currently job hunting and it's taking up a lot of time :( Fingers crossed something soon.

******* I am extremely tempted by the challenge just trying to decide between two ideas rattling around in my head. One focused on Arthur or one focused on the twins.

Oh did you finish the Aurors? I must have missed the last chapter somehow I'll have to head over there and see how that happened.
