Any fanfics were Hedwig shields Harry and dies from the Killing curse of Voldemort's during the battle of the 7 Potters and then Voldemort fires the spell again to which it ricochets back into him. That or Hedwig sacrificing herself to protect Harry, thus Harry getting another new form of protection? Thanks!
