:END:
In second year after the dueling club, everyone reacts badly to Harry being a parseltongue and Harry gets run out of Hogwarts. In order to find him, Dumbledore brings Petunia to Gringotts and finds out Sirius is Harry's legal guardian. Sirius then gets released from Azkaban and is still sane. He finds Harry and takes custody and starts working to get rid of the Horcruxes and generally make changes in the wizarding world. Also, he is in a relationship with Remus.
