Thinking mostly of how Death might share in his/her duties and have Harry guide people to punishment or a prosperous afterlife due to Harry being the Master of Death.

It popped into my head which I thought could be an interesting concept.


** In this fanfiction Harry dies, and rises to become someone who /helps/ Death in his duties. It is not completely what you are looking for, I'd say, but maybe you'll enjoy it.

** It's not because he's the Master of Death, but linkffn(The Little Veela That Could by Darth Drafter) has a dead Harry guiding several people to the afterlife.
