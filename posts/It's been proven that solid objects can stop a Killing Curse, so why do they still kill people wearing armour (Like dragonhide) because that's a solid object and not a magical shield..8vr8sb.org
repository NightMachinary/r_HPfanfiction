It might be a bit nitpicky of me to ask this, but is this explained even if vaguely?

**** I think so. But even if not, there's also the fact that the Curse doesn't splash harmlessly against the hard objects that stop it --- it /blows them up/. So at best your armor would explode while you're still wearing it.

** I like to think that Leather, clothes and wood are magic transmitter. That's why the killing curse can get through those armors. However, steel, iron or any other piece of metal doesn't transmit magic and can protect from the Killing Curse.

** Namely? All the objects used to block the killing curse were dense and very tough. For comparable armor, Harry and others simply wouldn't be able to move easily, if at all. Soemthing strong enough to wear would, at least, add numerous kgs, depending on the Material and the size of the armor.

Even if they could, the blocks were blown up. Getting hit with one would be like a small frag grenade going off at point-blank. It's simply more feasable to summon or conjure a block rather than wear it. Or, better yet, dodge it entirely

. As for Dragonhide...Well, i always thought it either wasnt solid enough, or resistant enough to prevent such a powerful curse from taking effect. Of course, it could be that the killing curse is super-conductive through more conductive materials such as cloth or hide. It might also explain the explosions of the non-conductive materials as basically being forcefully overloaded from the spell.

** Didn't a Gravestone stop one, so you'd want to dress more like a Knight than in Dragonhide. I'd like to see a fic where the Order wear Roman armour and stop the Killing Curses using a Tortoise Formation, slowly advancing on the Death Eaters.

** So far, only metal or stone with considerable thickness can withstand the killing curse. Not even repel, but only withstand. I think it would make a lot more sense to conjure or transfigure something to metal. But it'll probably be very hard as Transfiguration is a pretty tough subject for most people.

  Post OotP - Sirius is cleared and finally gets to give Harry the home he had always wanted. But, the war is escalating outside and the Order of the Phoenix needs to rise to the challenge of defeating Voldemort and his Death Eaters once and for all. They just might have to make bigger sacrifices than they had imagined. Harry and Sirius bonding fic. No slash. Semi-canon compliant.

Is this actually canon? I only remember a tombstone and the ministry statue.

It wouldn't be unreasonable to argue that you need a sizeably thick and sturdy barrier to stop a killing curse, thicker than halh an inch of dragonhide.
