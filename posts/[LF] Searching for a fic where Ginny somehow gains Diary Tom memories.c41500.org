I have been reading about Diary Tom for awhile now and I'm very interested into reading more fics that relates to him. Currently I'm curious if there are fics where Ginny gains his memories from his past like his childhood and stuff like that. Preferably a longer type of fic and non romance focused.

I'm also open to read any other stories in relation to Diary Tom if recommended. Same criteria.

Thanks!


** Book Learning by Zerrer. It's on an unusual site to find a fanfic, but it's the best Ginny with Tom's memories fic I've ever read.

Paying it Forward by pawn_vs_player is short and in second pov but it's Ginny and Tom combined.

Do Android Dream of Electric Sheep? by The_Carnivorous_Muffin is a good Diary one, but it doesn't have Ginny in it.

#+begin_quote
  Harry has been entered into the Triwizard Tournament against his will, and his friends don't believe him when he insists he didn't enter his name. Will Ginny Weasley sit by and watch him suffer alone, or will she risk exposing the dark secret she has been hiding. GoF re-write from Ginny's POV. Smart & slightly manipulative Ginny! Extreme Ron-bashing!
