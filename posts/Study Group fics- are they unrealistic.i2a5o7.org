I've read countless fics where from BOOK ONE Hermione organises everyone into a study grouo- often an inter-house study group- and everyone helps each other based on their best subjects etc.

My question is: what in the hell sort of eleven year old revises? I never studied for anything until GCSE (first actual qualifications in the UK, at age 14-15), I can't believe any of those children would willingly revise outside of the few weeks leading up to their end of year exams- except Hermione, of course, but she's our lovely outlier. I'm also sceptical that first year and second year would be so difficult that shedloads of revision is even necessary, since they have to accomodate the fact that some students have literally no background knowledge at all, they would assume everyone is starting from scratch.


** I'd always assumed the study groups were for homework.

A real life boarding school would have mandatory, supervised study time in the evenings , as children can't be completely trusted to organize their own time and don't have parents there to nag them into doing homework.

Hogwarts, as ever, is much more haphazard.

** I mean, in reality, yeah, I agree with you about revising completely.

But revising your times tables doesn't allow you to near-immediately make objects float and practicing your handwriting doesn't let you summon snakes or protect yourself from people firing shit at you from the deadly weapon they all carry. That might be a bit more motivating?

And I'm not sure, but I'm fairly certain it's canon that magic is tough and it takes a lot of practice to cast spells and understanding the theory is useful somehow - I'm not sure if it's for casting or not, though. So, there's definitely something to revise, even if it isn't everything at once. :)

*** Yeah I think magic is hard, I suppose if the homework is actually useful theory stuff then I get why they need it. Real life homework is usually governed by how little effort the teacher can give when it's time to mark it all in my experience (for the lower years at least) but Hogwarts is probably different. Maybe the professors have self marking quills or something. I still think very few eleven year olds are gathering a pile of reference books outside of their homework and going through them for class, which I've read a few times. I'm in uni and I barely read the background material! My work ethic is distinctly not Hufflepuff though, so maybe they do that sort of thing in other schools?

**** At eleven years of age, marking kind of is low effort. There is some evaluation of how you construct an argument or handwriting (which Hogwarts doesn't appear to care about, given Ron's habit of writing bigger when he runs out of things to say), but for the most part it's just "They mentioned thing A, one mark, they mentioned thing B, one mark" and so on.

And their essays are only measured in feet, anyway. For context, standard A4 printer paper is a little under a foot long. Average word-count per page is about 400-500 words. That's really not a lot to mark, with 40-ish students a year. My final year project for my degree was longer than that.

And I did do lots of reading in uni myself - but it's kind of hard to pass a psychology degree without being able to rattle off a bunch of different names in the essays. :D

But yeah. Otherwise, I think it's a mix of novel-reality (stories have to be unrealistic in places to make a story work - typically people run away from bullets and mystery and there's no plot if they do that), temperament, cultural transmission (there's literally a whole house dedicated to academics at Hogwarts, so that's at least 40 firsties a year who value reading and learning who can transmit those attitudes to classmates, and Hermione was definitely the only reason Ron and Harry ever did anything academic before the very last minute), and motivation ("Wow, Professor Flitwick levitated a thing! That's so cool! I wanna do that!").

You'll always get some slacker students, but there's enough reasons for students not to be that that I can see study groups popping up, even if not every student attends. Doubly so if it's a way to spend time with friends and make the aforementioned pathetically-small amount of homework easier. :)

****** Equally, them being something else too doesn't stop them from being swots. All I said was that they value reading and learning, not that they solely value reading and learning. 'Dedicated' can mean both things - English is delightfully ambiguous that way. :)

But yeah, they have to value reading and learning to get into Ravenclaw, even if they value other things too. That, I'm told, is how the sorting works.

** I agree, to me so many of them sitting around and studying is just as unbelievable as the mini politicians in some fics. I feel like a lot of stories use books and studying as an easy way to relay exposition and help power ups. This is something the books aren't completely free of either but usually in the context of Harry he only starts asking questions when he sees something suspicious or interesting, so that would be a more organic way to do things.

Maybe having muggleborns get into magic hobbies (other than the few we see in the books) and researching that. Like I'd love to see a really artistic muggleborn getting into magic painting and showing their friends and geeking out over it. If this already exists epic gimme links ;)

I can see the study group happening when they're older (I mean the DA proves that) but initially kids would be interested in so many other things and be distracted by each other. So a study group is doable but there're so many more interesting ways to convey the same messages. I like to try and think about how I used to prioritise time at that age.

Edited: I just added that I don't think a study group is fully unrealistic but there are better ways to do the same thing

*** I had a study group in school... We would focus on different tasks and then explain the topic to the next person, cutting our homework time by half and learning more because someone explained it to us... Even the teachers supported things like that. You could also get a tutor from a year above to help you out if your entire study group was shit at maths.

**** I don't have a problem with the idea study group per se (technically, the DA was a study group). I have a problem with 10-15 First year student deciding to for a study group by themselves. I have a problem with such a large group all working together in the library without somehow losing their concentration or (way more likely) being thrown out by Mrs Pince. I have a problem with people like Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger and Draco Malfoy sitting together at the same table, doing homeworks without any insult being thrown.

Like with most trope, my problem is not with the idea itself, but how it is treated.

*** Is it unrealistic because it's a thing students don't do, or is it unrealistic because of their age? Because I definitely participated in impromptu study groups for exams in college. (And I mean regular exams, not just finals.)

**** I think it's a bit of both. I think most of the 1st Year just don't have the maturity to decide "let's meet up this day every week to do the homework together so we are more ready to class", especially in a learning environment like Hogwarts where grade don't matter until the OWL and NEWT.

I could imagine someone like Hermione finding one or two students thinking like her, the saw way I could see some students planning study groups after seeing the exams approaching, it's the formality of the thing and the sheer number of student put inside by authors that I think unrealistic.

Student make informal study groups all the time, Harry and Ron brain storming ideas for their divination homework, or Hermione reading their essay to make sure it is clear could be considered as (informal) study groups. The same way, I would have no problem with a student from another House proposing some kind of deal to Harry like "You are good at Defense, you help me with it and I help you with Potion". It's the whole 10 students working together which annoy me. You can't have a true "study group" of 10 people, with this number you either have one student (often Hermione) that act like a teacher, or you have several study group each working on something and that jsut happen to be in the same room.

** I havent read a study group story that was realistic. We are talking about 11 to 17 year olds taking their time to study in and out of the curriculum instead of doing literally anything else. Its like those authors havent gone to school themselves. I just graduated one of the best highschools in my country and the studying almost always amounts to cramming things into your head a day before the exam. And for all the people saying they are extra motivated because its magic, pretty sure a majority of the hogwarts curriculum is teoretical. Also, almost everybody can reach peak phisical performance and live a healthy and adventurous life yet here we all are lazing around at home procrastinating.

** Yes, they are unrealistic. Let's ignore the revising aspect, because that's not important.

The study groups real use is to surround Harry with a fanatically loyal group of the "best" and get them to like each other or come around to a different way of thinking(despite being extremely incompatible).

They really suck. The author cannot think of a better way to get kids together. It's like they haven't read the troll chapter in the philosopher's' stone

** Good point. I can see muggleborns forming study groups in first year because "OMG Magic School!!!" And then possibly other outsiders like Neville agreeing to join just to belong to a group.

Whether they'd stick with it would depend on the purebloods targeting them, and them realizing it's "us against them" and they really need to keep their skills ahead of the curve or they're toast.

*** If you start year seven aged 11, then year 8= 12, year 9= 13, year 10= 14, and year 11= 15. GCSE'S are in year 10/11. You will have your 16th birthday in your year 11 but that doesnt mean you didnt start GCSE when you were 14. So if you want to be pedantic, the GCSE spans between the ages 14 and 16, but generally it is known that they are the qualification you take in your 14th and 15th years. Then, you enter Sixth form in your 16th year.

** I've seen them done well and done poorly. If it's "let's fanatically read course materials and theory" thats typically unrealistic to me. If it's more "let's look up cool magic stuff and share" like in "What's Her Name in Hufflepuff" I can believe it. I never started a study group in middle school, but I did read up on subjects that interested me that wasn't taught in class (electricity and robotics and stuff). I didn't make it very far because my math background wasn't advanced enough, but I was interested in it so I studied it. I could see myself doing something similar with magic, especially charms where we seem to get almost instant gratification. I might also like to look up hair charms or other things that might not be taught in class.

The other thing to consider is proximity and the type of homework. All the teachers ever seem to assign is essays which require them to go look things up in books, maybe their textbooks or maybe additional references. Having a larger group might be helpful since it would distribute the work a lot. I might have started a study group if I had to write essays in 6th grade, especially without the internet. On the other hand, I might not have because I typically went home directly after school. Any "study groups" I ended up in at someone's house got derailed quickly, but in a boarding school doing homework together makes a lot of sense.
