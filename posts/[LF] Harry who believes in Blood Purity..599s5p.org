Just as the title says. It's getting pretty annoying reading Slytherin!Harry fics where he's best buds with Malfoy and still becomes friends with Hermione. I highly prefer no slash, but give me what you've got.


** Considering that Harry's a halfblood, that'd be a little self-hating, I guess? I've seen a lot where Harry believes in magical culture and pureblood families preserve that so that's why he accepts the viewpoint in his friends like Draco.

***** He might think his Slytherin blood makes him just as pure as others.

Also he could just want power and knew that pureblood were the way to go (His comment in PS by the mirror says nothing about pure blood giving power).

*** Being a blood purist already requires a ton of rationalizations (among them some of his inmediate classmates, like Hermione, Neville, Crabbe or Goyle). At least Harry had 2 wizard parents.

**** I don't like the whole "oh, Hermione is better in class than Crabbe and Goyle, guess Mudbloods aren't so bad after all!" It's always used to justify Draco losing faith in Blood Purity.

He may rationalize it by pointing out that being good in class doesn't equal being powerful at magic. At the very most, I can see him going "you are a credit to your race" or something to Hermione.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be woth it...because he'd never be alone again.

RU fanfiction has a lot of it. Even more - I've read about the Celtic school with OC Llevellin who attend Hogwarts and set back the 'true magic standarts' so to say, 'coz Victorian theme in Wizarding World is way too modern and abuse the true magic

******** Oh! I see... It is a bit hard to deside what is simple as you are natural speaker but I'll try

Good and clear fics from Zajazochka if you like Snape/Hermione or just nice!Snape 8-) I'd recommend to start with:

- Pterodactile effect (like Butterfly effect) [[http://fanfics.me/fic83015]] - SI in Hermione before First year. Hermione had found that she's not Muggleborn but Half-Blood. Long enough to enjoy grey!Harry, evil!Dumbldore, Weasly bashing, nice!slitheryns
- Mudbloods [[http://fanfics.me/fic52380]] - Hermione parents died in accident and she was adopted by Muggleborne witch who'd quite Hogwarts after fifth year. nice!Snape again

And of course the previous fic Llevelin House also is not heavy referenced. I thought to recommend you my favorit all-bashing crack fic Children of Azkaban but it is heavily referenced to the prizon theme and lot of old soviet novies so I think it can be way too hard to read.

But if you'll meet any troubles I'll be glad to help you.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12123765/][Harry Potter & The Wizarding World: Book I - Dark Arts]] is a new, weekly updated fic with Harry that hates muggles and by proxy muggleborns, especially Hermione. The fic is decent, even though it has its, rather large, share of problems. There is very high possibility that Harry will reject his bigoted ways in the future.

Try Growing Up Black. It's quite well written and while he's no a full on blood purist he certainly doesn't care if those around him are. No hermione friendship yet /half way through it.
