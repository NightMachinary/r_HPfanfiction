The Dursleys take a family vacation to Australia during Harry's summer between third and fourth year. Unable to find any alternative they take harry with them.

Harry spends a few weeks Wandering around Sydney unsupervised while the Dursleys do the tourist thing and makes a few friends with some local kids and some highly dangerous magical creatures that he brings back to English.
