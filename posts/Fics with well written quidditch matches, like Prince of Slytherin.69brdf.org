** A few of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2638737/TheEndless7][TheEndless7]] works involve a post Hogwarts Quidditch playing harry.

Although I cannot quite remember if they go into depth or not.

*** The quidditch in VP is more about the 'off the pitch' obligations of the players and what is entailed with being a professional athlete. In QWC the quidditch is mostly just used as a framing device for the rest of the story.

Of my stories, Letters probably has the 'best' written quidditch matches from an actual gameplay standpoint.

**** I really really hate HP/LV fics and mentioning that pairing makes me instantly close a story. That being said, your work Limpieza de Sangre is so well written it makes me glad that I tried reading it.

Thanks for writing awesome fanfiction^{^{Iloveyou}}

** I don't remember PoS having well written quidditch, but that is mainly because I just enjoy the rest of the story so much that quidditch is like a side dish.

** linkffn(Rise from dust) has some interesting quidditch matches. (Depending on your tastes you might not really tolerate the first one or two chapters, but I'd suggest powering through them if that is the case.)

linkffn(Travel Secrets: First) and its sequels do as well, though quidditch is not the focus of the story.

  If Harry's baby brother, Daniel, is the Boy-Who-lived, then what of Harry? What is his role? Is he destined for greater? Or, is he to play a much bigger role in the future? Follow Canon's plot, with much bigger AU's plot as the story progresses.

  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one. (The world belongs to Jo!)

** Why hasn't this been mentioned yet?! Pure story of qudditch and going pro. Actually one of the up there stories I've read in terms of quality writing. Doesn't get enough praise. Abandoned, but abandoned at a point near the end where you feel somewhat happy and complete the ending in your head.
