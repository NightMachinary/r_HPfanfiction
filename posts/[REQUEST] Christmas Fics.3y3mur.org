It's almost christmas hpfanfiction! Give me some nice warm christmassy fics that will fill me with christmas cheer.

Merry Christmas


** I've always loved the Christmas chapters in linkffn(Vox Corporis). The author used the holidays as a way to bring out some character traits in her protagonists that might otherwise have been neglected. I particularly enjoyed the portions (around Chapter Twenty) describing Hermione's extreme fastidiousness with decorating and the interactions with her very well written family.

  Hermione and the others aren't sure why, but the leadup to Christmas in Gryffindor Tower seems to be fraught with nothing but chaos, mistakes, and of course, Harry trying to be helpful.

** You might want to check out the Hoggywartyxmas fest, which is in its sixth year of posting on LJ right now. It concentrates on the Hogwarts staff; if you're only interested in Harry and his generation, it may not be for you, but I highly recommend it. This year's opening story, for example, is charming:
