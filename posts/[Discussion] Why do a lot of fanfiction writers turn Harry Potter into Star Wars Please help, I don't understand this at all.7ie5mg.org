Hello! Please see the title! I have read a few fanfictions lately that were recommended here in posts that confused me so much and I do not understand them. These /stories had/ Dumbledore being called a Lord Of The Light and Voldemort is a Dark Lord, and Harry and the Order fight for The Light Side and use Light Magic to fight the Death Eaters Dark Side and their Dark Magic, and families that are on Voldemort's side are Dark and Harry recruits Light families, and then Dark Magic is corrupting and addicting - /just like the Dark Side of The Force in Star Wars is written as being!/

/I don't understand any of this!/ It is so frustrating and confusing to even read, because it is all entirely stealing off of star wars and turning harry potter /into star wars!/ I don't understand why these writers do this? I don't understand it. But it is not enjoyable to read /at/ all! And it is because I thought the whole point of Harry Potter was that the characters all had their flaws and their mistakes and their motives and reasons for doing things, and they were complex and realistic for it. But then these fanfictions just go: No, you are Dark Side, you are Light Side, join the Light, join the Dark, use Light Magic, use Dark Magic, it makes you Dark and evil! You are a Dark Family so you have to stay away from me and die and never talk to me! I am a Light family so I am always going to be with the Order of the Phoenix and follow Dumbledore forever! /WHY?!/

And yes it is ripping off star wars because of these reasons:

Dark Side of the Force = Dark Magic.

Dark Side = Dark Side.

Light Side = Light Side.

Light Magic = Light Side of the Force.

Dark Lord = Dark Lord of the Sith.

Light Lord or Lord of the Light Side = Jedi Masters.

Dark Magic use corrupts and addicts you = Dark Force use corrupts and addicts you.


** For example: The big bad of the series has a disfigured face because he's so damn evil. The big bad of Star Wars has a disfigured face because his own evil power was reflected back on him.

Everyone picks a light and dark side because that's the way the story went. There were exactly two sides: Good Perfect Heroes and Evil Corrupted Dipshits. Every character was placed firmly in one of these two sides within the first few minutes. The /one/ exception to this rule is so notable that he's regularly described as the most complex character in the series.

The morality in Harry Potter is about as deep as a puddle on a summer's day, which is also precisely the problem with the Jedi and Sith in Star Wars. You're either outright evil (and by extension, stupid and ugly) or you're a moral paragon who farts sunshine and rainbows. It really wasn't as deep as you make it out to be. Hell, even Rowling admitted she fucked up by having /an entire house dedicated solely to being evil/ and tried to rectify it in later writings and statements.

It's literally described as being "black and white." By its very nature, there are not many ways for it to manifest.

Their few good deeds, made due to personal interest and not morality, do not undo their countless bad ones. What exactly did Draco do to earn his freedom? Maybe he amounted to some improved prison conditions, but not a pardon for several lifetime imprisonments.

no, there weren't? did we read the same series? the one with statements like 'the world isn't divided into good people and death eaters'? the series elaborates on the flaws of /many/ of its heroes. sirius is immature, and was often cruel, even to his friends. so was james. remus was selfish, insecure and a coward. dumbledore was a baby fascist, and a shitty administrator/spymaster as an adult. 'manipulative dumbledore' isn't some fan contrivance, it's literally just an echoing of snape's accusation. crouch sr. was a neglectful father. molly and ron were often casually misogynistic. aberforth fucks goats. i can go on

** ...because the books too talk about "Dark Arts" and "Dark Lord" so it's easy to say that those who don't belong to the "Light Side"? Certainly, the characters are flawed and have their complexities in HP but on the other hand, everyone in Slytherin is evil, everyone who uses Dark Arts is viewed with suspicion etc.

I'm not surprised that people take that and run with it, and take it to it's 'logical extreme' /shrug/

*** Just from fact that the HP universe contains the Dark Arts, it doesn't at all follow that not using the Dark Arts makes you a Light wizard, or that using other kinds of magic constitutes an opposing category of Light Arts. Somewhat analogously, not being a murderer doesn't make you a pacifist.

The whole Light-Dark idea is disliked for good reason, it's terribly clich√© and stupid. It's clear from the Harry Potter novels that the term "Dark Arts" describes magic which damages the soul, leaves irreparable damage to yourself and others and is specifically intended to harm, torture and kill. All of these things make it a pretty bad idea to use Dark Magic, not some kind of philosophical outlook on morality which disagrees with Light Magic. There are plenty of people with cruel intentions in HP who are not "Dark".

Tolkien's universe is pretty well documented, though. This isn't the reason. The hobbits were not "turned invisible," really. They were shifted into the Unseen Realm, the "wraith-world." Extended use of the rings eventually leaves one entirely in that realm. The invisibility has no dependence on their race, as hobbits. It was entirely because of their mortality. A man would be turned invisible in just the same way, but an elf would not.

"The free use experience" has this issue. The smut is some of the best around, especially the "new experiences" due to metamorphic gender change. But most of the story is some bullshit politics centered around a rape law (free use). Want people to shag around? Explain it with magical society. No need for a law that legalises rape because it is "networking".

******* But it should have some amount of "realism". Your girlfriend's mother will not join you if she is happily married unless her husband is involved as well (and they both have that particular fantasy but we are talking about smut here so that is a given). But if her husband cheated on her and left, leaving the GF's mom an emotional wreck you can probably convince her to join you in a night/lifetime of debauchery. Keep it easy, make it somewhat "believable". I am not expecting a bad spinoff of Bismarck's realpolitik, I am expecting the reason why people have sex and "being horny and having the opportunity" is perfectly alright.

Let's go back to my favourite example, "the free use experience". The whole Harry being able to change into a girl thing is a good starting point. Want his sister to be part of the fun? Why not? Want Harry to explore how it feels to have sex as both a girl and a boy while portraying a slow shift from "sole attraction to girls" towards bisexuality? If you pull that one off you are writing some good stuff. Having characters develop over the course of the story? That's good.

But why would you throw in some absolutely retarded legalisation that says "either get raped and pretend to enjoy it or say goodbye to your future prospects" into the mix and spend most of your work dealing with that? Would it be that difficult to centre the story about a voluntary sex club where you fuck everything that moves? You could even keep the original motivation why Harry's sister joined for fuck's sake.

You could claim that this is part of their war against muggleborns but that would be saying the Holocaust was ok because the Third Reich was waging war against the Jews.

The flair is a provocative statement towards the Death Eaters/Harry and Death Eaters/Hermione shippers, who usually go for the "Draco in leather pants" or "Voldemort did nothing wrong" tropes and are honestly writing stories about the actors and not the characters.

  Geneva convention
#+end_quote

Yes. That's part of what I'm talking about. A formal definition of a "civil war" would be this, from the International Committee of the Red Cross:

#+begin_quote
  1) That the Party in revolt against the de jure Government possesses an organized military force, an authority responsible for its acts, acting within a determinate territory and having the means of respecting and ensuring respect for the Convention.

  (2) That the legal Government is obliged to have recourse to the regular military forces against insurgents organized as military and in possession of a part of the national territory.

  (3) (a) That the de jure Government has recognized the insurgents as belligerents; or (b) That it has claimed for itself the rights of a belligerent; or (c) That it has accorded the insurgents recognition as belligerents for the purposes only of the present Convention; or (d) That the dispute has been admitted to the agenda of the Security Council or the General Assembly of the United Nations as being a threat to international peace, a breach of the peace, or an act of aggression.

  (4) (a) That the insurgents have an organization purporting to have the characteristics of a State. (b) That the insurgent civil authority exercises de facto authority over the population within a determinate portion of the national territory. (c) That the armed forces act under the direction of an organized authority and are prepared to observe the ordinary laws of war. (d) That the insurgent civil authority agrees to be bound by the provisions of the Convention.
#+end_quote

From the Wikipedia [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war][page on civil wars]].

By that definition, I would not call the conflict that is Death Eaters vs Ministry of Mgic a "civil war."

Further, even the intro to the Wikipedia article states that civil wars are fought with regular armed forces, of which we see none in the Harry Potter series. Aurors are magical law enforcement, which implies that the Ministry of Magic does not treat the conflict as a war, more like how a government would fight organized crime.

I'm reading a few papers on the US response to 9/11 that deal with the classification of terrorism as acts of war vs domestic crime, I'll just edit this with the links when I finish.

*********** *Civil war*

A civil war, also known as an intrastate war in polemology, is a war between organized groups within the same state or country. The aim of one side may be to take control of the country or a region, to achieve independence for a region or to change government policies. The term is a calque of the Latin bellum civile which was used to refer to the various civil wars of the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC.

A civil war is a high-intensity conflict, often involving regular armed forces, that is sustained, organized and large-scale. Civil wars may result in large numbers of casualties and the consumption of significant resources.

The romance element seems like heavy-handedly papering over the cracks that the story essentially becomes one of collecting female 'characters' like dolls with different colored wigs to put into the hero's item bag as he progresses and gains achivements etc.

It's kinda a little sad to see when you get the sense the author thinks that that's what healthy relationships /are/.

** Okay, it seems like there is a lot of anger in this thread so I'll try to provide a counter point. Star Wars does not have a monopoly on the Dark vs Light dichotomy. It is a literary tool that has been used by many people in many different pieces of fiction, from books to movies to video games. It's not weak writing on its own unless it is done weakly. Which I'm sure some of the fan fictions y'all have been exposed to have been.

Much of what you are concerned about is done through extrapolating on what is in canon as well as reflecting it for literary symmetry.

We know that Dark Arts are a thing. We know that many people consider them something to be defended against and avoided, but we also see people like Snape drawn to them. This can be extrapolated when someone is trying to fill out their story by continuing the train of thought. What makes Dark Magic Dark? What is its definition, is Dark the absence of Light? Does that mean that there are Light Arts too? JK Rowling never mentioned them but that's the whole point of fanfiction, to add and expand.

Voldemort is the Dark Lord. In canon Harry and Dumbledore share the role of the reflection of the Dark. In fanfiction that can easily be done by making either of them ‚ÄúThe Leader of the Light‚Äù in name as well as in action.

Dark or evil being addicting or corrupting is also not a Star Wars thing. It's human nature to view giving into darker paths as addicting and corrupting. Hell, that's the whole point of Dr Jekylll and Mr Hyde. It's a human thing not a writing thing.

I also feel that Dark families vs Light families isn't actually something from Star Wars at all. It's usually used in political fics which people can be pretty opinionated on. I can't remember any of that in Star Wars at all. In fact the main family of Star Wars is almost evenly split between light and dark. I'm not exactly sure what your problem with this is other than the words light and dark.

I can understand why it can bother you, and I won't deny that some authors may draw from things that they like about Star Wars, but not every use of Dark or Light is an attempt to turn Harry Potter into Star Wars.

*** Okay, thank you. Also yes what irritates me about the Dark and Light family thing is that it is so SIMPLE. It is simple to the point of being frustrating. How can you reduce human beings with thoughts and dreams and motives and everything into "Oh your whole family is Dark and you are Dark and Dark is Evil so you will all ever only be and think EVIL forever!!!!" and the same thing for the Light family stuff. "Oh they are such a Light family they are so good and righteous and every one of them is amazing and Light because Light and there is no question or doubt or independent thought or anything because Light!"

/That is what irritates me about these stories I read!/ So much! They are just reducing humans with everything inside them into just plain "You are Dark or Light forever and that is it. That is all there is to you, that is all you will ever be. You have no motives, you have no dreams, you have nothing. You are a Dark family or you are a Light family so obviously you will always be Light and Dark because that is it." And they write those characters that way for the whole story and they are not even characters, they are like statues or something to be pushed around for all they have any /complexity to them./

It is so /simple and reducing and/ it is so frustratingly irritating to read because it is! It is like taking a sphere and squishing it down into a tiny flat blank plain dot!

**** Now that is definitely bad writing that's upsetting you and is completely understandable. Light and Dark as political factions and families can work well of written well. Example from canon: The Blacks as a family are described heavily as ‚ÄúDark‚Äù. But in the two characters we are given more details on we see actual characterization. Sirius rebelled against his families wishes while Regulus bowed to them. Sirius went to Gryffindor and joined the Order while Regulus went to Slytherin and joined the Death Eaters (back to the dualism of light and dark) but they have light and dark in both of them. Regulus treated Kreacher better than anyone else, while Sirius was a small minded bully for most of his schooling and almost got Snape killed.

That is how things should be handled in fanfiction too. You can have Dark and Light families and political factions with all sorts of financial, political, and familiar pressures for characters to toe the line and stay with how they were raised, but it should be part of what makes the character who they are, not what defines them. I think when it comes to bad writing there is the simple fact that many fanfiction writers are just hobbiests that are stumbling through with something they enjoy without the technical skills that can make good writing. I'm sure they haven't taken the time to think about the characters they introduce and what motivates their actions. That is what leaves you with generic two dimensional Dark cardboard cutouts.

** Well, in general, to many readers it isn't clear that "Dark Lord" in a Potterverse setting is just a title Voldemort made for himself that nobody before him had. And to be fair, the most powerful bits of Dark Magic /do/ corrupt their user in canon (that's why Voldemort looks the way he does), although there's no "addiction" shown.

From then on, you have milder similarities (the good-guys society called the Order of [Something], to which the old eccentric but very powerful mentor belongs) that are really just tropes but play into the similarities. The fact that the original /Star Wars/ trilogy and the first three /Harry Potter/ movies share the same composer may have factored in. Voldemort himself dresses in a black hooded robe and has glowing eyes, so comparisons to Emperor Palpatine are hardly surprising.

The movies even muddied it up further by having Hagrid say Voldemort "turned people over to the Dark Side" in the first movie. It was just a turn of phrase, but instantly familiar to /Star Wars/ fans.

The result was fans getting a conception of the Potteverse's Dark Arts as pretty much the Dark Side of the Force. The whole "Light Lord" thing is the Order of the Phoenix being played up to eleven in an attempt to "even things out" and not make the villains too powerful.

** Dark vs Light is a slight reframing of Good vs Evil, which is a standard conflict in stories for about as long as we've had stories. Stories about people following their respective leaders into battle are about as old as having leaders and battles.

The trope that doing evil makes you enjoy being evil is also pretty old -- older than the Star Wars series, I'll wager, and it appears in far more than Star Wars.

******* I think you are upset with the way the books were created using third person limited perspective focused on Harry. You need to remember that Harry's personality didn't lend much toward explaining the deep mechanics of how the magic fundamentally worked. Perhaps if the story were focused on Hermione's point of view then JKR would have explained things like this to the reader. Instead the reader got little snippets here and there to show Hermione's personality of being a bookworm and to show that Harry and Ron didn't actually utilize all the opportunities they had in school to learn about magics grand scope.

Personally I was frustred with how blas√© Harry was about learning and becoming a better wizard. I would think that considering his constant battles with dark wizards and looming deadly threats he might seek out learning everything he could, but we need to remember how his character started off knowing nothing and not really understanding what was happening to him - he was just an oblivious child for over half of the series after all. Or perhaps it just shows him trying to grasp on to any semblance of a "normal" childhood considering his total lack there of. I guess who can really blame him not feeling excited about learning considering he is a somewhat damaged child who wasn't able to grow up in any sort of healthy environment and with such little healthy relationships or role models.

Thinking back during your education do you remember the lectures on how mathematics worked or how chemical reactions worked in science class? I know I don't, but I know what I need to know for the application of some information to get through my day. I wasn't ambitious for the same of knowledge - it was for the sake of application. I didn't really care about learning stuff I didn't immediately see as helpful, so I assume Harry felt the same way which would explain him really only excelling in Defense class.

I think JKR never INTENDED to show the reader how magic works beyond wand motions, incantations, and intent. In depth explanations for the readers sake interrupt the flow of the story. It would also take away the mystery and wonder of a new magical world for the reader to explore alongside Harry throughout the series. In reality JKR explained more about magic then most fantasy series I know about. I think it's a bit disengenuous to say JKR wasted the opportunity. It wouldn't make sense to have pages upon pages of technical explaination about how magic works throughout the series when the character has little interest in that as well as the target audience being children who have little interest in reading something that feels like an excerpt from one of their school books.

Personally my favorite topics of fanfiction focused on the magic being worked --- the unraveling of how it can be manipulated, created, and changed, as well as characters learning or creating new or interesting ways to use spells.

  #+end_quote

The last sentence describes magic consistently tagged as Dark, such as Fiendfyre and Horcruxes in separate instances; and, Sectumsempra in this passage:

#+begin_quote
  "I can't make it grow back, not when it's been removed by Dark Magic. But it could have been so much worse. . . . He's alive."
#+end_quote

Voldemort also gave a great statement on how important intent is for magic within the Wizarding World.

#+begin_quote
  "There is no good and evil, there is only power and those too weak to seek it."
#+end_quote

As in, some magic may not be good or evil. Power is neutral. But, if magic is used for cruelty and pain, it can be considered Dark. This is what makes the Unforgivable Curses unforgivable. To use them, one must have the intent to control, hurt or kill others.

There is a very significant difference between a magical system which goes completely unexplained, and one which is mysterious. The former is just a deus ex machina generator, the latter can create interest plot points all its own. In fact, when handled properly, a magical system with known elements makes the more unusual magic (sacrificial magic) more interesting precisely because it doesn't all entirely occur because "a wizard did it."
