... and therefore the Order et al. have to continue their war effort without their Chosen One.

I just got this plot bunny and am curious if anybody has executed and published it.


** I can't remember the name of the fic, but Harry dies because of the Dursley's being tricked before the start of OOTP. LSS, Voldemort wins, and the story is mostly about the how people lived in this world. Spoiler warning, it's not pleasant.

** I remember a fic where Harry dies during the second task and transfers something to Gabrielle, but I'm a little fuzzy on the details.

It's the Little Veela that could I'm thinking of, Harry features as a ghost in the story, but best I can come up with.

** This is a bit of an odd fic. It does something I have never seen before it and haven't seen since it. It fulfills the requirements of what you asked for, but it is not focused on what happens after Harry's death, rather his death is where it ends. It is a bit of a weird one, but in my opinion it is fairly good.
