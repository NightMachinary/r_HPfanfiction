** If you don't like a ship, I suggest that you don't read fic featuring that ship, and don't spend your time baiting those who do like the ship.

*** Okay! I'm not baiting anybody. Just my opinion. I think they're overrated, I don't dislike them though!

*** I'm really arrogant. I'll admit it. Sorry about that. Ronarry! That's an unusual one. I actually have never heard that, but now that I think about it, even Ron and Harry act like a married couple.

That's very logical!
