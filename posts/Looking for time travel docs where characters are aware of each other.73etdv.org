Hello! I absolutely love reading fanfiction where Harry is able to spend time with his parents/marauders in the past and to be able to experience their personalities and the fun! I prefer for the past characters to know who the future characters are.

My absolute favourite is wish upon a star, I've also enjoyed timely errors but it didn't have that family love!

I read fated chance which I loved, even if it is just one important character knowing, I'm happy!

I also love alternate universe stories where they know each other. Any suggestions? Ideally they'll be complete!

That is a first part of a trilogy and something similar to what you said happens in the 3rd one. There AU!Harry exchanges places with Canon!Harry. The Potters find out eventually (not a spoiler, it was kind of obvious) and have a lot of family bonding with our Harry. All the while still loving their own Harry, so no bashing.

The trilogy is surprisingly good, though you can't tell by the premise alone.

  What if Wormtail hadn't told Lord Voldemort the Potters hideout. What if he took Harry straight to him instead? A Dark Harry fanfic. AU Mild HG

  Starts as parody of the formula most independant!Harry stories follow. Overly friendly Goblins, Manipulative Dumbledore, a shopping trip, a will from Sirius etc... Then it gets weird.
