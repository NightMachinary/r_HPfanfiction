*** He wouldn't necessarily live long, though, before starving and becoming a wraith again.

And the death of the sun would likely finish him.

** There was a story how Voldemort finally achieved life forever ... and how it was not exactly what he hoped for. After living five thousand years completely lonely on the destroyed Earth, it was not that fun as he hoped it to be. Actually, it was more like the hell.

*** [[/u/Vercalos][u/Vercalos]] Actually, I think Voldemort would be like Am the Supercomputer from /I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream/ . He'd keep a couple of individuals alive and torture them for eternity for his own amusement.

** So basically [[https://dcau.fandom.com/wiki/Hereafter][Hereafter]]?

â€‹

That covers an existing immortal finally getting what he wanted and taking over the world only to find that immortal life is much more boring when you have managed to do that, so it might be different for an immortal trying to undo his immortality, but eh :P

*** I remember writing a story about someone who was functionally immortal due to the rules of that universe requiring that people fulfill their purpose in life before they can die, and him still searching for his purpose, centuries on in life.

**** Good show, DC Animated has been killing it for a while.

In this particular episode, Superman is thrown forward in time, and finds one of the immortal supervillains living alone on a deserted, post-apocalyptic earth. Turns out he took over and everyone else died. He had a lot of time to himself. Read self-help books. Constructed a time machine to undo his stupidity. Sends Superman back in time with instructions to stop himself :P

***** Yeah. I read the article. I know the DC animated shows, for the most part, are miles above their live-action films when it comes to storytelling.

I mean, I look at /Mask of the Phantasm/ and /Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker/, and I have a difficult time thinking of any live-action DC film that tell that good a story. I mean, I like the Nolan Batman films, and Wonder Woman was a lot of fun to watch, but I honestly feel like the characters in those two animated films had more depth than the characters in the live action film.

And I believe that /Batman: The Animated Series/, is perhaps the best iteration of the character to ever appear on television.

On a side note, I wish Static got more love. His show was one of my favorites growing up.
