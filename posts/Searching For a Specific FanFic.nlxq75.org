:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi kind strangers,

I have been searching the internet for a drarry fanfic I read a while back, likely 2 or more years ago at this point. I likely read it on Wattpad, but AO3 may also have been the platform. I have yet to find it but I have a general recollection of the premise and would love some help in tracking this fanfic down as it was absolutely amazing!

General premise (as I can recall): It's almost like a HP rewrite/AU where Harry grew up in a different household and was never abused. He was childhood friends with Draco Malfoy and they grew up together. The story itself starts from childhood and follows through Hogwarts and the war, with slow burn drarry. A key point is how powerful Harry is, that he has long hair and is a pacifist. It kind of follows a few travels and he learned from sages and eventually gets a fancy title for his work.. There is a particular scene that I recall where tiny-for-his-age Harry meets with Voldemort, and I recall that the encounter itself was uncomfortable and Voldemort was particularly creepy. I believe during one of the later Hogwarts years, Draco comes into his veela inheritance and Harry is his mate. Harry is very loved, somewhat sheltered at first as the people around him are protective of him, he is small for his age and long haired, Snape is a father figure to him, it's a very long fic...

I know it's not a whole lot to go on, but I am desperately trying to find this story, and I was hoping someone may have read it too and recalls the name or is willing to help me find it.

Thanks so much for your help!
