** Probably the same way, seeing as Hogsmeade was founded a few decades after the school itself.

Or it could be similar to the Quidditch world cup stadium, where they remember they have something else to do when they approach the location - which sounds like a modified confundus charm.

** While Muggles couldn't normally see Hogwarts if they got there, I'm pretty sure Hogwarts is Unplottable so they couldn't get to Hogwarts in the first place. Since Hogsmeade is nearby, I assume it's hidden the same way.
