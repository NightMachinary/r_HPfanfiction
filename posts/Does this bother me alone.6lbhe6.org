I've always been interested in the Marauder era of Hogwarts and I've been reading MWPP fanfiction for a long time now but there are some things that really get on my nerves reading Marauders fanfiction and mainly, they are these:

1) Marlene McKinnon, Hestia Jones, Emmeline Vance, Alice Longbottom, and Dorcas Meadowes all being Lily's best friends or one of them (Marlene McKinnon) being Sirius's love interest. We have absolutely no canon evidence to suggest that these girls went to Hogwarts with Lily or were even in Gryffindor. Now, Alice being Lily's best friend is unlikely because she and her husband had already made a name for themselves as they were famous and well known aurors and I doubt that teenagers were going to be those highly respected aurors within only a few months or a year of finishing auror training. Besides, Alice was also pregnant with Neville.

2) Sirius and James not being able to tell left from right without Remus by their side to guide them. Now this is absolutely ridiculous as both Sirius and James were described as very bright by Professor McGonagall and they were both members of the Order. They were abducted into the order right after graduation as far as I can tell and they were frontline soldiers and they were both freakin' animagi at the age of fifteen. They must have also been powerful as the weakest of them (Peter) blew up an entire street and he was described as an average wizard.

3) Peter being this stupid, drooling and utterly useless boy. Why not make Peter a likable character? Shocking, I know! The rest of the marauders considered Peter their friend and that's why his betrayal was so depressing.

4) James and Sirius eating like pigs. What canon proof do you have of that?

5) Peter doesn't have blonde hair, he has mousy brown hair as far as I can remember and please correct me if I'm wrong.

6) Now, this makes me want to shoot myself. Lily is by far the closest thing to a Mary Sue in the entire series but that doesn't mean she is one. Lily is made into a prodigy in fanfiction as people write her as powerful enough to take down two death eaters twice her age with a single spell. She is also written as stunningly beautiful, the smartest witch in Hogwarts and overall small details that make her into an utter Mary Sue.

7) Remus being this boring prefect that does nothing but moan at Sirius and James because of their pranks and whatnot. Now, Remus is definitely not boring as far as I can remember as he arrives late on his first class and then proceeds to dress boggart!snape into an old woman's clothes and handbag. Is that a sign of a perfect angel?

8) Sirius having a girlfriend every other week because of what? Because he was handsome? Being attractive doesn't mean you snog every single girl your eyes rest on.

9) Petunia being the devil. Now, I'm not saying it's Lily's fault that her sister is jealous of her but Lily is shown snooping around her sister's private business and they're sisters so they likely fought everyday because of teasing or something. I'm sure that Lily provoked Petunia at one point in seven years because of Petunia's jealousy.

10) Remus having wolf senses/features outside of the full moon. In the fanfiction world he is super strong and can smell anything from Slytherin dungeons while up in Gryffindor tower when it isn't the full moon.

11) Snape not having friends aside from Lily. It was implied that he did have friends (Avery and Mulciber).

12) Bellatrix, Andromeda, Molly and Arthur had all graduated from school when MWPP were first years and Lucius was a fifth year.

I'm very sorry if this offended any person who came across the post but I really needed to write that.


** Honestly, it would make sense to me that Peter would have blond hair as a first year because people's hair frequently darkens over time. A lot of people also have hair that lightens in the sun, so Rat!Peter not getting sun could be the reason his dark blond hair looked mousy.

** It is indeed dumb. With regards to issue number 1 it is especially dumb that Hestia Jones or Emmeline Vance were Lily's best friend since Harry meets both and they don't mention it nor to they try to have a part in Harry's life. That being said, having nothing but OCs is often unpopular and these are canon names to fall back on and pretend they aren't OCs.

7) Is the one that grates on me most, especially when concerning the interactions between Remus and Lily. Just for a moment remember that Remus went into Hogwarts expecting no friends and being terrified people would learn his secret and hate him. James Potter was his friend, probably his first friend, a friend who included him and led the others to become animagi to help him. Lily is the girl who constantly puts James down and depresses him. While James Potter might have been a brat, all evidence suggests you couldn't ask for a better friend. Remus would likely take issue with the idea that James is terrible and might even avoid Lily because of it. Never forget how petty children can be. If Remus and Lily were as close in canon as in a lot of these awful fics then Remus would have been able to tell Harry lots more stories about his parents.

2) James Potter and Sirius Black hold the record for most detentions, it is likely that equated to losing a lot of house points but I think I remember reading that they earned as many as they lost meaning that they were likely brilliant.

Honestly most Lily and James stories are extremely formulaic and poor compared to several other pairings. I won't more but have to settle for trying them only when I'm too tired to actually think.

*** Why do people assume that nobody tells Harry anything about his parents?

**** I mean, it's likely that people /did/ tell Harry about his parents, but we don't really see it happen on-page in canon, save for a few small instances. I want to agree with you, definitely, because if we assume that Harry was left in the dark, then everyone who knew his parents but didn't talk about them are total bastards.

But characters like Vance or Jones being Lily's friends are unlikely due to the fact that Rowling would have made it much more important, or at least mentioned it in passing. As it is, Sirius and Remus are the only real links to Harry's parents that we know of, and making Vance/Jones/insert-actual-OC-here Lily's friends is, I agree with [[/u/herO_wraith][u/herO_wraith]], a bit of a ham-fisted attempt to use canon names for what are just OCs, like any character in fanfiction that is just a name and has no actual personality to work with ^{/cough/} ^{Daphne} ^{/cough/} ^{Greengrass} ^{/cough/.}

***** I didn't defend Vance and Jones being Lily's friends, because in my headcanon they were years apart from each other. I don't think people told him a lot about his parents, mind, and they probably limited themselves tactfully to only the positive things, but he wasn't kept completely in the dark. I mean, they were quite willing to share photos of them with Hagrid.

War and possibly nepotism may also explain how someone only a year or two ahead of MWPP being able to become a well-respected auror by 1981, so we can't completely disregard Frank and Alice being around their age. (Just see how Tonks, being only 3-4 years out of Hogwarts by Voldemorts return, often gets glorified in fanfics.)

Daphne Greengrass doesn't count, since the fanfiction community has made her almost as real as - or even more so than - most canon characters.

Also, this is fanfiction - people can name their OC's whatever they want. I'm much more annoyed with the characters being copies of Harry's contemporaries, like Pandora spouting Quibbler stuff, Frank Longbottom being a clumsy herbology whiz, Lily being "super Hermione", etc. Well, that and Peter being Secretly Evil All Along.

****** Fair enough, but people acting like the personas they've created for these background characters as canon will always irritate me, just as OP isn't happy with things like the often-assumed friendship between Remus and Lily because they're both apparently bookish. But I also agree on that last point. They should be distinctive and individual, not copies of characters we already know, because otherwise what's the point?

However, I'm gonna disagree with you on the Greengrass front.

No amount of "she's the /Ice Queen/ of Slytherin" will make her character real - or, as you say - more than the canon characters. She is and always will remain an OC and /nothing/ more, no matter what anyone does with her. This "persona" that gets transplanted from story to story doesn't equal an actual identity, and isn't helped by the fact that many stories with her in (from a massive variety of authors) give her about as much depth as shot glass, with actions that wildly differ from the /Ice Queen/ identity they slap onto her.

By all means I've seen /interesting/, /original/ versions of Daphne Greengrass that are engaging to read, but the fact that she's Daphne has nothing to do with that part. The same identity could be equally as engaging if it were transplanted onto some random person called Cleetus.

** I like to imagine Alice and Frank being Seventh years when the marauders were just starting Hogwarts. It works well with Canon.

Some stories do show the Slytherins boycotting Snape because of his mudblood friend and while it does seem odd as the Canon portrays it differently but it is a bit less annoying because it made a little sense at least.

I do like Marauder fanfictions with Snape as the main character because it differs from tropes like these. They do have the tendency to glorify Snape but as it is his younger years rather than the Professor we are familiar with, I can tolerate them. In linkffn(The Prince's Harem) Snape does have friends after the infamous Worst Memory and my favorite Marauder era fic linkffn(Time Turned back) does deal with the perfect Lily trope.

And yet no one ever mentions who liked her, besides James. None of her friends ever get in touch with Harry. We never hear about a godmother.

If her best friend or friends are dead or out of commission, problem solved. Yeah, there isn't much evidence for it, but (other than what you mentioned about Alice) there's absolutely nothing against it either. And when it comes to Alice, the training program for Aurors isn't that long, because Tonks is a super young one. I often hear three years, but I don't know if that's canon or fanon. Anyway, say it's three years. Alice could easily have been just a year above Lily then. There are very few Aurors, we know that the Longbottoms were well-liked, not so sure about famous, but all the other Aurors would have known them because there just aren't that many Aurors.

The fandom has given them their own personalities and it has become quite popular. Marlene being this female version of Sirius + being dirty. Dorcas being this younger version of McGonagall is quite popular or being as innocent as a unicorn.

Just two things. First, I'd like to mention that the age of the characters doesn't actually matter.

*** Lily isn't a prodigy. You can say that Voldemort, Dumbledore and Grindelwald are prodigies because they are/were. You need to remember that Horace was talking about one of his favorites and he himself says that he is biased. Imagine that Ron and Hermione are dead and Harry is talking about them to Hugo and Rose. He wouldn't say that Ron flunked History of Magic and Divination. Hermione will seem like a prodigy when Harry describes her brains but I don't think that she is. Now Lily is brilliant at Potions but the same can't be said for other subjects and Charms. People seem to think she was a prodigy at Charms, the best enchanter/enchantress since Merlin himself. Just because her wand was good at Charms doesn't mean that she was. Take Ron for example, he has the same wand wood (which is generally good for Charms) and I really don't seem to remember that he was described as exceptional at it. I don't seem to remover that she was the smartest witch of her age. Please give me evidence from the books if you can because I don't seem to remember it.

This is a bit unfair. You need to remember that Lily was 21 when she died. Voldemort, Grindelwald and even more so Dumbledore have had decades to perfect their arts and gather experience. And those three were more than prodigies, they were simply geniuses.\\
So, was Lily a genius of the level of a Tom Riddle? Probably not. It doesn't mean she wasn't among the most gifted wizards.

You don't need to be Ramanujan to be a top level mathematician. Hell, you don't need to be Ramanujan to be considered a genius, even.

#+end_quote

Why not? She's a skilled witch that happens to know an unusual and powerful spell, I don't see the issue. You don't need to be Merlin to perform obscure or powerful rituals. It is completely possible that when she learned about the prophecy, and that Voldemort was after her son, that she decided to try and find a way to protect Harry further, stumbles on this ritual or spell and decides to roll with it in a gambit. Or that she adapts or alter a preexisting ritual or spell to do so.

We know nothing of the magic involved, except that it's unusual and requires the sacrifice of your life. We don't know if it's difficult to perform, we don't know if it's that complex a piece of magic. And we don't even know the maximum extent of Lily's skill. Or Voldemort's or Dumbledore's or Merlin.

Now, as the spell isn't widely used, it is safe to assume that it is outside of the grasp of the average wizard, or simply really obscure. All it says us, however, is that Lily is no average witch. It doesn't make her the second coming of Dumbledore, let alone a Merlin.

If it were the case, she would give Voldemort the fight of his life, and potentially, Harry Potter would be a far shorter read ;)

I agree. Although I meant something a little less defined by freakish accident theory. The idea that the sacrifice alone was enough to save Harry. If you want, that something simply went wrong during Harry's attempted assassination, and Voldemort died instead.

Absolutely. Simply willingly standing between the Dark Lord and his victim is already akin to sacrifice yourself to protect the victim. A lot of mothers would do that.\\
The only thing that could have an impact, and isn't usual, in this situation is the attempt of Voldemort to make a Horcrux out of Harry's killing. So maybe, he botched the ritual, or Lily's sacrifice worked because he was making a Horcrux. Maybe the fact that his soul was already splintered played a part.\\

Someone actively trying to protect Harry is a bit far fetched in my opinion.

Rowling said that the Harrycrux was an accident and Voldemort wasn't trying to create one as he had already split his soul into seven parts: himself, the didadem, Hufflepuff's cup, Slytherin's locket, the ring, and Nagini. The act of murdering Harry's parents and the attempted murder of a guild rindered his soul unstable and that's how the Harrycrux was made.

You missed the diary. Despite, are you sure Nagini was a Horcrux at the time? I can't remember. But if Voldemort wasn't trying to create a Horcrux, it removes one of the best ways to explain the accident. Because it's the only thing truly unusual about Voldemorts' raid. I mean, the father falls protecting his wife and child, then, the mother falls protecting her child, and finally, Voldemort's attacks the child. Nothing seems unusual.

And it still doesn't tell us how everything happened.

As Lily's the one who makes the sacrifice, she was the most likely to be involved, it doesn't necessarily mean she had to do it all alone. The thing is, obviously, James and Peter couldn't be involved, or James had a reason not to trust Peter. Could still work, if Lily and James decided to not confide this last line of defense to the Marauders (Not far-fetched, as they suspected one of them was a traitor (unless I'm mistaken about that? I'll have to reread the Canon sometimes).\\
It could be another of Dumbledore's plots, but that seems far-fetched.

It's just a theory anyway, but I think it works well. I mean, I see no reason to dismiss the idea (I mean if you're willing to ignore the word of god, obviously, or you stick to the sober universe).

--------------

There is certainly evidence, however weak, that leans towards them being older than Lily.

Dorcas: Voldemort killed her personally. Would Voldemort consider a teenager to be some serious threat? I really don't think so and I always imagined her as being older as to having more experience.

Emmeline: She would have talked to Harry about his mother had she been her best friend, I really see no reason not to.

Hestia: Same as Emmeline.

Alice: Mentioned in post.

Marlene: Now Marlene bugs me very hard. I recall that Lily was saddened by the McKinnons' death and not specifically Marlene's death and I don't think Moody would mention a teenage girl to represent a prestigious magical family and refer that they 'killed her whole family'. He would have mentioned the mother or an elder.

I've always imagined Marlene as the Molly Weasley of the original order for some reason. Then again, we don't have evidence to support either my theory or fanfiction writers' theory and it's al left to the imagination.

Besides, Lily wouldn't mention the death of her best friend and Sirius's love interest with some light gossip about Dumbledore.
