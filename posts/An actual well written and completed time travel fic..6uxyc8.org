  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

**** Thirding. IMO far and away the single best piece of FF ever written. It's the only HP thing I've read that I felt truly nailed the characters.

That aside incredible use of Time Travel too. My biggest pet peeve in time travel FF is the notion "oh, lets use our future knowledge to beat voldemort in the space of about a month or so".

The fact that it realistically made Snape into a good guy was also amazing. Snape and Sirius becoming friends is something I never knew I needed until this.

This also has probably my favorite Dumbledore in any FF too. The majority of Dumbledores you see Harry hates for being manipulative, despite the fact canon Harry never showed any signs of resentment over the revelation that he's a horcrux. This Dumbledore acknowledges what he did, asks for forgiveness, and then treats Harry as an equal. IDK why that's a novel concept in FF but Harry and Dumbledore's dynamic in this was fantastic.

/ahem/ I uhhhh might have gone on a bit long there. Anyway, give this a read, it's so so good.

** I had a thought that if adult Harry goes back in time without his magic it would make an interesting time travel au with new obstacles (how to get things done as a squib, how does a squib protect himself from wizards) does anyone know a fic like this?

I was imagining adult squibbed Harry existing in the as of that moment cannon Harry's world along side young Harry, if that's more clear.

** If you consider time loops as time travelling, then I recommend "The many deaths of harry potter" linkffn(12388283)

The story is brutal initially but once the story gets rolling is pretty damn good, especially since this Harry isn't overpowered, he's cunning and rational, a bit of a cynic so he thinks of ways that can kill him so this, in turn, influences the way he uses magic in incredibly creative ways, and probably why it's one of my favourites
