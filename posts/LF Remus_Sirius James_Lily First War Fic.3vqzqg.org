I read a fic years ago, either on LJ or FF.Net (most likely LJ). The vague plot details I remember are: one part where James and Sirius are on assignment for the Order for weeks, and they're living in a tent. Lily sends James a sexy polaroid of herself to tide him over. There was actual art of said polaroid; I think it was just Lily in fishnets. I'm pretty sure Lily worked for St. Mungo's? I can't remember much else--only that it was long, well written, and fairly funny.


** I am pretty sure it's called The Shoebox Project :)
