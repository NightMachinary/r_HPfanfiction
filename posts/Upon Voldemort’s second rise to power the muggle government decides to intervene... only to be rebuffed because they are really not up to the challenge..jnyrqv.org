I guess after one too many muggle-wank I would just like something in which the muggles try their “science and modern weapons curb-stomp magic” routine only to find out the hard way that magicals have been developing mass-destruction much earlier than them with rules that are much more flexible than the ones they have to work with.

Some ideas are: magical clothing is naturally bullet-proof, nuclear explosions have been developed centuries earlier by alchemists as well as countermeasures, magical enchantments don't make it /hard/ for muggles to find/destroy something, they make it literally impossible for them to make any headway at all.

Alternatively wizards are the only thing keeping some world-ending Eldrich monster in check, so when muggles interfere they accidentally free Cthulhu, an unstoppable plague or invulnerable insects that feed on human flesh over the world (in this case wizards can either be forced to retire for their own warded locations built exactly for a situation like this or crash-and-burn alongside the muggles).

Voldemort either intentionally provoked the muggle interference or even used the Imperius curse to have them intervene and provoke their destruction while the wizards sit in their bunkers, and, if they're nasty buggers like Tom, have a hearty laugh at the "filthy muggles" getting pwned by this... Eldrich thing.

Tbh I love both muggle wank /and/ wizard wank, if they're well-written, so hit me with it.

** What I've always wanted to see is a single wizard just tearing through an entire squadron of soldiers (though I'm aware that it'd be way easier to just order the Muggles to destroy each other) in one of those muggle-wank fics.

One wizard just apparating from soldier to soldier. Bullets? Repelled by their imperturbable charm. They kill a soldier here, confund a soldier here to turn on his fellow soldiers, transfigure an elephant to attack the soldiers whose rifles are definitely not equipped to deal with an elephant. Frankly what is a soldier to do against someone who can transfigure the ground, curse the air, and shift reality at a whim? Suicide with a grenade? Shield charm. Hide? Homenum revelio and the supersensory charm.

Anyone who is suggesting nukes and weapons of mass destruction? Those would do far more damage to Muggles than Magicals. Sure you could wipe out Diagon Alley, along with entire London and have 10+ million casualties. It be like burning down entire forest to get rid of one ant hill.

But beyond that, magic is far too versatile, beyond Muggle understanding or comprehension. While I hate the analogy, Magicals with a wand are like gods compared to muggles.

** Wizards as they age tend to see less cases of accidental magic, and while they do seem to have more resilient bodies then their muggle counter parts it wouldn't be to such a degree that a gun would be ineffective on them. The idea of accidental magic or inherent magic being able to protect them is absurd, and a gun could take out a wizard easily enough. The real problem is that unless the wizard is super careless the muggles will never get the chance to fire that gun at the wizard. I do like the idea of alchemists figuring out Nuclear physics centuries ago, and that radiation is something that the magical world has cured in full but doesn't spread to the muggles to keep "irradiated" areas free where in reality its just magical land.

Magical clothing and objects seem to only be able to hold so many enchantments/effects without deteriorate unless its made out of some high quality material like goblin forged metals. A bullet proof cloak would be something that I would imagine would be standard for Obliviators, and Aurors/hit-wizards and no one else.

​

on world ending events/plagues I think that most of the natural magical plagues would count, nothing in conventual science would work on them and the muggles would just die to them. Spread might not be to bad though given how fast they would work given muggles frailer body's. A good example of other world ending threats would/could be that demon incursions are still occurring and the ministry corresponds with an international team to deal with it but with them gone ITS TIME FOR A NEW CRUSADE. I don't think most of the magical creatures that exist would be enough of a threat what with dragons, basilic and thunder birds are all endangered creatures. I could see how back in the day before wands were wide spread they could have possibly caused an extinction event if massed/inclined enough to but then again they aren't the most sentient and social of creatures. Actually I think the funniest thing would be that the goblins just show up and be all like, Thanks for killing the wizards who were nearly enslaving us and all that also did you know that we know Nuclear physics and are immune to radiation? We also live underground so all your bunkers are belong to us, and ooh that's a cool mushroom cloud and another and another and oh your dead, well sorry but we kind of wanted to salt the earth on our new home, leave no chance of that near enslavement to happen again.

** Look, this debate crops up a lot in this community and it's always a slog to get through, so here's the deal:

Wizards are hella powerful. They can, given enough time and incentive, create or emulate pretty much any effect known to man. What few limits they have are easily overcome by applying a little ingenuity to any situation. And historically, all a Wizard or Witch has ever needed to survive has been a wand and a spellbook full of basic enchantments and spells a third year is capable of.

That being said, they are very much not invulnerable. They live in a world where virtually every legendary monster actually exists and has specifically evolved to both use magic as a weapon and as a means to defend against magic likely to be cast upon or otherwise used against it. There is a reason DADA class is taught from day one at Hogwarts and it's not just to learn how to counter jinxes.

Harry gets injured... A lot in canon. Bludgers still hurt when they hit. Plowing into the ground still leaves quidditch players concussed. Getting pelted with glass, hit by objects or set on fire still wound people. Just because they are sturdy as hell doesn't mean they aren't susceptible to the effects of kinetic impact, merely that they are more resistant to it than the norm for the rest of the world.

Otherwise, objects such as swords, spears and shields being wielded by the piertotum statues would make no sense. The bridge blowing up underneath the Snatchers would have merely had the effect of leaving them slightly scuffed up by the time they hit the bottom of the ravine. Fred would have survived having a wall dropped on him.

So they aren't invincible.

Now, onto the muggle side. Muggles are very, very good at killing things. Muggles have developed weapons, tactics, strategies, industries and even entire economies around the process of killing people and taking their stuff. Relatively small enclaves, such as single cities or island countries, to say nothing of what amounts to a bunch of dudes on horseback turning left instead of right one day, have been able to conquer vast territories on the basis of their weapons technology and logistical prowess alone. A single muggle or even a hundred is mostly no big deal to defeat, but when you start playing with armies of millions that have the resources of entire continents at their Beck & call? That's when things start to get very dicey.

Then you have two things that are largely alien concepts to the average Wizard on the street: infrastructure and scientific advancement. There is little need for the former in the Wizarding World because anything that can't be achieved through the use of a wand can be achieved by crafting a potion using locally sourced ingredients. There is no need for the latter since the rules governing the universe the muggles live in (such as the speed of light, the laws of thermodynamics and maybe even Planck's Constant) simply do not apply to magic. And while that's a definite advantage to being a wizard, it also means that most of them don't understand a simple truth that has come to define the modern world- that technology is becoming more and more powerful every year. 20 years ago, a machine that sported 16 gigs of ram, 2 tb of hard drive space and a CPU capable of hitting 4 GHz was a supercomputer that could comfortably meet a large company's computing requirements with room left over for server farm administration etc. Nowadays, those are the specs necessary for an average to moderately high end gaming computer... Graphics card not included.

Similarly, great strides have been made in every field of human endeavour, often to the point where some of them would be likely incomprehensible to a Wizard. Explaining a fusion reactor or a GPS system to a pureblood is probably something of a pastime for muggle born of all ages.

But this strength is also a massive vulnerability. Supernatural elements such as magic are the domain of conspiracy theorists and religious yahoos one bad day away from self-inflicted martyrdom these days. There is also an argument to be made that scientific progress also means that using the word 'magic' when describing a phenomenon a typical Wizard would know to be magical is potentially a massive no-no, since any scientist shrugging and calling a phenomenon 'magical' in nature would lead to that person being basically stripped of their titles and ostracised by his colleagues. Unexplained phenomena such as shape-shifting items or sapient cars would be disregarded as a silly prank at best since things like that are pure fantasy. It also means that if/when a muggle scientist discovers a magical phenomenon they can reproduce in a lab, the local Ministry will have a hell of a time keeping that under wraps since nobody will dare to use the word 'magic' to describe /anything/ in a scientific environment.

So a bunch of Wizards rocking up and asking for help from the muggles? Not going to happen. Statute of Secrecy or not, nobody seriously believes in magic. Even if a Wizard were to go on live TV and demonstrate their powers in front of a live audience, all anyone will think of is either that the local Newsies must have splurged a little too much on the CGI or that this dude's going to be the next David Copperfield.

And if they do get in conflict with each other, then what? That boils down to which side has the best intelligence on the other.

It's naturally skewed in the Wizard's favor, since all they have to do is boot up a computer and trawl through Wikipedia for basic answers. Follow that up with Google Maps and a dive through a couple of LinkedIn profiles and you have a list of targets and locations for who to Imperius to gain control of strategic defence assets.

But... That requires the Wizard to know how a computer works. And that the Internet exists. And what a search engine is. And what you can and can't trust Wikipedia about.

On the muggle side, they don't have easy access to the Wizarding World. Thet need a man on the inside to read them in. A position only a muggle born would really be able to provide. And if they do, the muggles will still face the toughest question of all-how to actually win.

*** Let's say Voldemort actually does attract the Government's attention and someone steps forward to help. They identify targets, locations and access points. They get lucky and, despite massive setbacks and through a whole lot of luck, actually kill him. Mission Accomplished? No. He's resurrected the following day. His minions survive a tank charge. The Snatchers run afoul of a machine gun nest, but they just get replaced. The following week, the task force is wiped out. More targets are designated, ops plans drawn up and the MOD green lights a bombing run. Voldemort and most of his minions survive and their revenge is brutal. Crucially though, a number of Wizards are killed, meaning that it's a partial success. Very partial, but still. So they order another. Voldemort starts probing the muggle world and gets noticed by the Aurors.

This is the crux of the problem both parties face: the MOD can opt to escalate. Bombing runs, artillery strikes, the works. However, they're only partially effective and rely heavily on support by magicals to designate targets and relay success or failure, which is a big no-no militarily. Direct military engagement is off the table because there is no accurate way of finding and hounding an enemy that can fucking teleport. Drawing them out into the open for a battle /may/ work, but would again rely on heavy cooperation by magicals, who would likely disagree with the whole 'disregarding collateral damage' aspect of tossing around heavy ordinance in a place as heavily populated as the UK.

Voldemort too could escalate. Taking over the government and the MOD would be relatively easy. But that would be a massive violation of the statute of Secrecy and cause every ICW signatory to dogpile him. Dark Lord or not, the prospect of not only fighting a two front war with the Ministry but also an ICW strike force the likes of which checked Grindelwald would be a battle he would lose, prophecy or no prophecy. There's also no guarantee that the army taking pot shots at him would actually stop firing, since they would be privy to some of the most sensitive classified information in history and would therefore likely be isolated from the rest of the military command structure until they were finished.

From the MOD's perspective, traditional victory conditions would be unachievable. From Voldemort's side, it's a question of whether he could get away with splitting his focus. The answer is no.

Neither side would ever get to the point of actual fighting. It would be very clear to the MOD that they would be picking an expensive fight with zero payoff and a whole lot of ways in which the conflict could go disastrously wrong. For Voldemort, fighting the muggles is a pointless endeavour that would wreck his chances of actually controlling the British Isles for decades if not centuries. Better to consolidate his gains and wait for the muggles to collapse in on themselves, then swoop in and establish himself as ruler when all potential opponents are dead.

But there is one last thing the muggles have that would allow them to help in the struggle against Voldemort without engaging in direct conflict-weapons.

See, the vast majority of the problems muggles would have when facing off against Death Eaters have to do with the fact that they have no reliable means by which to cast magic. They can't enchant a tank to run itself. They can't curse a bullet to break a shield in the most explosive way possible. They can't apparate or use portkeys or transfigure random household junk into usable materials.

Wizards can.

So the best course of action for the muggles would be to furnish the resistance and the Ministry with as many weapons as possible along with documentation explaining everything about said weapons. The Wizards could then bespell these weapons as a surprise asset in their fights. That would solve most of the MOD's problems whilst only jeopardising a small warehouse's worth of obsolete equipment to boot.

In short, muggle wank is bad because it ignores the basic reality governing muggle life-sciences and practicality. Muggles would never believe magic people are real. They don't really have a stake in the fight. They have too much to lose and no clear goal to strive towards. Unless seriously provoked somehow, they'll let the magicals Duke it out between themselves.

However, wanking the magical world is equally stupid. People are still people and Wizards have an impressive ability to simply ignore the muggle world occupying 99.99% of Britain's landmass in favor of anything else that catches their fancy. There are holes in their knowledge you could fly a plane through and they're individualistic enough that forming a coherent team must be beyond the scope or ordinary everyday magic. Until they learn how muggles fight, they'll never be able to completely counteract all the lovely and impressive ways humans have dreamt up in their endless effort to rid themselves of humanity's greatest predator; other humans. Remember kids, you cannot counteract a blow you just don't see coming and there's plenty of things the Wizards just outright ignore about their neighbours despite it biting them in the ass, again and again, for each and every magical species they have ever dealt with (to wit, Goblin Rebellions).

Leave the wanking to December. This is no nut November after all.

**** Eh, generally I love to just discuss about a potential Magicals x Muggles conflict and you are by far one of the ones who seem to have actually put /a lot/ of effort in this discussion so, to briefly address it: yeah, realistically a war would be just too unnecessary and costly to get any government in either side to agree and separate groups would most likely not have the resources or know how to fight in anything close to effectiveness without being immediately smacked down by both the other side /and/ their own people, the case I can see where it would become even close to worthwhile is in a situation of extreme scarcity or apocalyptic climate conditions in the muggle side while the wizarding side just magics the problems away and don't feel like sharing, if the situation is bad enough for the muggles I can actually see them attacking the magicals to try forcing them into helping (if both sides are screwed there would be just no point), other than that a war would be probably even more unlikely than a nuclear war.

Once said that, supposing that there is a war unlike what seems to be the dominant opinion it wouldn't boil down to armies of muggles and wizards facing each other until one side is completely extinct. To start with for all we know the enchantments that protect their areas from being noticed by muggles do exactly that, muggles wouldn't be able to enter because the enchantments wouldn't care if the muggle was aware of magic or not, they would be turned around either way or not even be capable of guessing that a place is magical at all despite whatever evidence piles up, /maybe/ weapons that cause damage around a general area may work /if/ it is not something that can be easily reverted with magic (like much muggle diseases) or that the place is protected against (explosions are very old, /someone/ must have found a way of keeping their houses from falling after putting an wrong ingredient in a potion or when your neighbor takes offense to their habits of crackling madly at 3 in the morning when they put the right ingredients in a potion).

In muggle areas wizards are essentially impossible to differentiate from muggles, they are just as ethically diverse as us and despite the old argument about clothing if someone is already walking an street (for some reason) it is really no big deal to just copy everyone else, plus this would be mostly the purebloods who generally just don't like going into muggle areas at all. Either the purebloods are an elitist minority living in their warded mansions that know absolutely nothing about muggles because they just plainly don't go into the muggle world or they are the rule and every wizard behave like them, you can't have it both ways. Of course, if someone started casting magic they would be noticed, but even ignoring apparatation and the issue of response-time once a magical is spotted, if they were trying to go undercover... why would they? And all this is without even considering that they can turn invisible, read minds, erase memories, make themselves literally impossible to notice, confuse people around them (which can't be used as a way of spotting them since the mass panic caused by false-positives every time someone got lost in memory lane would cause more damage than a wizard probably would actually be able to cause by using mind-magic), have clothings imbued with shield charms (thanks to F&G)... in short they would be /very/ hard to spot and the tries would most likely do more harm than good.

The information problem is probably one of the easiest to solve for both sides, if muggles can hire muggleborns to tell them about the magical world then purebloods can kidnap and legilimens/veritaserum the hell out of high-position muggle officials, so I will go ahead and put it down as a non-issue.

Plus in all probability a war would end coming down to who can cause the more damage to the other side's infrastructure and supplies, this one I would say that magicals would start with the advantage with legilimens to find out locations, apparatation and invisibility (in the board sense, so including sound-muffling too and other such things) to infiltrate and only needing a wand to cause damage instead of heavy equipment, if we are going with a scenario in which magicals are performing a planned in advance attack and had the time to plan for maximum damage there could even be some possibilities of them either poisoning or cursing the supplies, even /if/ muggle means can identify poisons (like basilisk's) it wouldn't be able to do anything about the whitering curse Dumbledore got from the ring for example, later on they could take countermeasures like moving their supplies to remote and secret locations (though it would up the cost a lot to both make the moving and supplying their population), but a first attack could be devastating, more so if they time it to be set off simultaneously in all major population centers. In the question of their own supplies magicals have an advantage because, to start with, of their wands that are a virtually unlimited individual source of water to every single one of them, food would be trickier, but if they are staying at one place maybe setting up their own supply, if I am remembering right supposedly food can be both multiplied and transfigurated from one kind to another, so it shouldn't be that hard to just set a plantation that produce random kinds of foods year-round and them multiply and transfigurate it as they please and store it with space-expansion charms, and this is without considering the possibility of charms to prevent or even revert spoiling or make plants grow instantly.

In an actual no-holds attempt to exterminate each other... I would say that the end-result would be a burned-out husk of a planet that will be a not so nice place for the survivors to drop dead. One side has nukes, the other fire that will actively hunt more things to burn, doesn't have a set time limit, can destroy pretty much anything and can only be stopped with magic, it is arguably if wizards would actually be killed by nukes since their powers are all over the place with seemingly no hard limit, but both /will/ succumb to Fiendfyre, the curse would potentially burn from coast to coast if not stopped, and if muggles decided to say /fuck it/ and drop nukes all over the place the following nuclear winter and the actual ice age resulting from the smoke of concrete being sent into the stratosphere and blocking the sun would make it either impossible or very unpleasant to live in the world for the years (or decades) that it would take for nature to fix itself, wizards /could/ potentially still grow food by using the Lumus Solem spell, but it would be /very/ work intensive even if they managed to magic away the effects of ionizing radiation or just vanish the nuclear waste outright before planting.

Edit: Oh, got so lost in the argument that I forgot to say, but this is actually a prompt about an inversion of the usual muggle-wank in which muggles just don't have the fire-power they think they have in a fight against magicals. I love this kind of discussion and am almost always open to it, but this is not really the goal of this post.

*** Actually the Statute of Secret was adopted either in the XVII or XVIII century (don't remember exactly which) in a time where the burnings didn't actually have that much prominence anymore (between the ones at the Dark Age and the ones in Salem) and it was a close tie between going to war or the Statute, plus it is implied that most magicals actually weren't overmuch affected by the burnings (mostly only muggleborn children) due to apparatation and protective charms.

Okay, even /if/ the shield charm is so uncommon as some seem to think the shield imbued clothing F&G came up with makes this officially a non issue now that all magicals can walk around with shields 24/7.

I guess someone could slip sometime, but it would have to be in a location accessible to muggles (without protective enchantments) and before magicals lose patience and just Fiendfyre the muggle's asses (tricky question, if a fire can't be stopped by water or any conventional means, actively hunts more combustible and can cross places even if there is nothing to burn there /when/ will it be stopped?

"Uhm, why?"

"Well, we can't find them."

"But we gave you their coordinates."

"That you did, and a reconnaissance patrol did indeed find a Death Eater stronghold there. But when we dialled our guns in, we found that the coordinates no longer existed and could therefore not be set."

"...Oh."

"So we launched a Fighter-bomber wing to take them out. That turned out to be a bad idea since the new bombs require a target lock before the safeties could be disengaged and, well, the system failed to see a target and thus didn't lock on. So we tried cruise missiles, and..."

"Let me guess, no lock."

"Worse. The initial lock was stable, it went in just fine, but the target lock disappeared and a malfunctioning gyroscopic stabiliser sent the tomahawk missile flying into a nearby barn. So we then tried a ground assault."

"You what?"

"We sent in the Royal Marines, yes. And they did actually do a good job of things, but..."

"Oh no."

"Well, when we recovered them, they had lost all memory of the op and their prisoners had disappeared into thin air."

"Fucking Ministry."

"Indeed. So, after wasting millions of pounds of taxpayer money and having to bench a squad of Royal Marines for months until whatever psychological after-effects acute short-term memory loss can cause have been successfully managed, it is the opinion of Her Majesty's Government that further interference in these affairs by military and law enforcement officers of the United Kingdom would be ill advised."

"oh no."

"That said, here's a set of keys to a cold war bunker in southern Shropshire that holds every weapon type the British Army has ever fielded in battle alongside vehicles and tanks still kept in working order. As long as you keep them from general circulation and do not attack assets of Her Majesty's Government using them, you are free to do with them as you please. Oh, and their operating manuals are in the Bunker's library alongside a nice selection of fantasy books to take the edge off."

"Umm, thanks?"

**** That one (potentially very common and easy to cast) effect screws over pretty much every modern weapons system that isn't man-portable and a fair number of others that are. Tanks that can't find their ranges, artillery that can't be set to hit certain coordinates and drones that can't pan their cameras onto the spot their operators want them to? That's pretty much all your conventional assault support options off the table. The tomahawk working is merely because I believe there would be a limit on the area of effect casting such an enchantment would have. So you can see the target using satellite imagery, but doing anything other than dropping a dumb 1000 pound bomb simply won't work... And even that bomb could end up getting its effect nixed by a widespread cushioning charm or something equally silly if the Wizards see it coming.

So yeah, I can totally see that scenario actually occuring if someone does go to the military and ask them to solve the problem through traditional military means. They're a nice hammer you use to nail things like enemy nations and other armies, not to try and eliminate a 50-100 person terrorist organisation that can fly, teleport and mind control people at will on top of casting something like that on a house in half an hour at most.

No, the organisation you want to contact would be the intelligence agencies that deal with the more esoteric kinds of national security issues ( not Aliens, but more... Unconventional avenues of intelligence gathering and intelligence management, such as trying to stack Castro's wife's tarot deck to set out a particular spread of cards that will convince her to convince him to tackle a particular issue in a particular way).

** The thing is; you're assuming here that the muggles are stupid. You're assuming they won't hire magicals to help them, that they don't research the consequences of their actions, and that the international community won't interfere if there really is some eldritch or apocalyptic restraints that would be messed with.

Like, /obviously/ robes used for fighting should be bulletproof, there are a number of charms that do this and /not/ using them would be stupid. Why should that stop anyone? Just shoot for the head. Use flamethrowers, RPGs, grenades, high caliber rifles that will kill on impact alone.

Nuclear explosions... nobody is going to use a nuclear bomb in the middle of the UK. Even if the magicals /could/ survive it, which isn't actually that far fetched, nobody would ever throw a nuclear bomb at london or Hogwarts, or anywhere on UK soil.

Hard to find something... well, sure. That would be the case, except they would have magical help, so it really shouldn't be any harder for them to find anything than for other magicals. Probably easier, thanks to sheer numbers and resources, but at the very least it won't be /worse/ than what magicals can manage.

If the muggle world goes to war against the magical one in its entirety, and refuse any help from magicals then... well first off, how the fuck would that situation even come up? That seems... a little bit extreme. In that situation, someone has obviously fucked up, or this just isn't a rational universe, so yeah, the magicals win. Big badda boom, one Basilisk could conceivably kill an entire army by its lonesome with nothing on the muggle side being able to do anything. A Nundu? Even more deadly. A Dementor? Unkillable, invisible, and all but unstoppable. The muggles /would/ lose in a straight up Muggle vs. Magicals Death Battle. There's not a doubt in my mind about that.

But that would never happen, because the muggles would have magical help, and so the entire situation becomes one large magical force vs one smaller magical force but with comparatively limitless mundane resources to throw at any problem, and /that/ is a completely different battle.

*** And you are assuming that those wizards they got help from would be capable of giving them this kind of help in large-scale when in all actuality chances are that they would only get help from some battle-oriented magicals that would still turn on them upon facing too heavy losses. If the protective enchantments are made to make it /impossible/ for muggles to find/destroy/affect something then no amount of pointing at the thing would make a difference since it would be literally unknowable for them and incapable of being damaged by anything other than the right counter-spell.

If they can cancel moment (literally /Arresto Momentum/) and cast shields on their clothes that only allows a certain amount of force to be transferred or even something more conceptual like a protective enchantment that blocks anything that roughly fits into the concept of a bullet/bomb then there is no loophole non-magicals can use, plus hats and scarves should take care of the face, it is already very farfetched that that many people with a good enough aim as to hit the head with little/no prep-time would be able to get close enough without being toasted alive; plus if bullets are a concern then fire would have been taken care of much earlier (I think there was a witch that let herself be burned alive many times because she liked the trickling sensation).

And pretty much everyone taking the muggle-side of the dispute seems to think wizards are stupid and wouldn't have ever found a way of fighting back. My argument about nuclear weapons was more along the lines that magicals have the ways of making the explosions /and/ surviving/fixing the aftermath, so they would be able to just jump to mass-destruction from the get-go while muggles would worry about the consequences were they to do so.

And the point of an Apocalyptic/Eldrich threat being on a restraint is exactly that they wouldn't be killable or mortal, so the only thing that could be done was seal the threat on the affected area and keep watch on the seals so it doesn't get loose. Magicals having to deal with something like this on their backyard for centuries would probably get nervous and try researching ways of, if banishing it outright were impossible, then at least keep it away from their homes, muggles wouldn't have that protection. To say nothing of the chance of it being some plague a dark wizard tried to cast like a worse version of the Black Plague that can't be cured without magic, or a good old zombie apocalypse, these are always lots of fun all around, there is literally no way of them defending against it, or for a more cannon-compliant alternative we know dementor's breed and are unkillable by normal means, maybe the only reason they didn't overrun the world is that wizards regularly exterminate bunches of them, a small force hired by muggles would be unlikely to be able to do the same efficiently.

**** The reason everyone thinks magical are stupid is because THEY ARE. Arthur is supposed to be an expert on Muggles but can't pronounce electricity are tell his son how to use a phone. It's canon that the Hogwarts class on Muggles is way out of date and we have repeated examples of wizards who cannot pull of Muggle dress.

So while I'll believe that there are occasionally Wizards who can counter Muggle weapons, the average pureblood doesn't know near enough to counter military tactics and weapons.

***** Ok, what is it with people confounding expert with enthusiast? This is the second time /today/ I have to correct someone about it. Arthur's job had absolutely /nothing/ to do with ‘blending in' with muggles, only with recognizing magic in muggle objects and (at a stretch) reverse it, with glamours, notice-me-not's, obliviating and desulioment charms he wouldn't even need to /talk/ with a muggle to do his job, and this is not considering the fact that as the Department Head his work would be mostly administrative instead of field-oriented. Arthur is actually a muggle /enthusiast/, not an expert, an expert is someone who is expect to dominate a wide-scope of information about a given subject, an enthusiast only likes the subject and learns about it at their leisure with no objective other than enjoyment and no rigid study-schedule or a goal of dominating every field of study, for example, I would consider myself a space-exploration enthusiast because I find the subject cool and look for documentaries to watch about it, but I am in no way even close to being an expert on the matter and claiming to be so would be a great disrespect to all those who /did/ invest the time and effort to learn more than the surface knowledge I acquired at my leisure.

In no moment of cannon do we see any evidence whatsoever about the quality of the Muggle studies class at Hogwarts, the fact that Hermione didn't complain about it at all is already a good sign for it actually (really, her complains are fandom, check the book if you want), plus we have examples that some wizards can't pull off the dress-code to what amounts to a different culture from their own that they had no reason at all to research previously, Kingsley was able to infiltrate the PM's office without raising any suspicion, Sirius' room was full of muggle things (and he also had his motorcycle), Moody was able to blend in pretty well at Kong's Cross...

Calling an entire population idiot is... actually pretty par of course from the perspective we are looking at, I mean, I myself frequently say that my country is full of suicide idiots because they elected a guy whose only noteworthy characteristics are being incompetent as fuck, being publicly and excessively bigoted and being corrupt as our president (they don't even have the excuse of saying they were caught unaware, the guy literally went to TV multiple times to sing praises to torture, insult women in general and defend the homophobic theories of a mad philosophy drop-out who says public that Pepsi is made with dead fetus and that Einstein was an idiot, yeah, it is /that/ bad)... the point I was trying to make before losing myself on a rant about my country's general stupidity was that by definition every population ever is generally stupid because we consider someone smart only when compared to the rest, so the general public will always be dumb in every country in every society at any given time no matter how advanced because dumb is by definition the intelligence level of the general population with the smart ones being the outlets. So yes, wizards are dumb, so are muggles and so are we, that would influence in nothing a societies ability to cause damage, and the purebloods would be only a legilimens away from becoming deeply familiar with everything muggle warfare while the muggles wouldn't have the same advantage.

Plus you still didn't address at all the possibility of magicals keeping greater threats at bay and being disrupted by muggles bringing the end of the world (or the dementor issue) or even the possibility of magicals nuking the world and then fixing it as I said.

P.S.: For anyone else reading this and wondering, yes, I know this is a prompt/request, so I don't actually need to make cannon the baseline, yeah I know this is not contributing in anything at all to the prompt and yes I know I can just block whoever this person is and be done with this... but honestly I just love those muggle vs magical discussions, it is always interesting to pick apart the other person's arguments and defend my point of view, I will block if it degenerate in name-calling or pure opinion battle, but for now let me have my fun.

Again, saying he defines what counts or not as a muggle artifact only means he was the one to present the law, actually making a law is a long process that involves not only the politicians, but people who actually know about the matter being discussed and interested parties, in my country for example: when we were discussing the law about abortion not only our legislative body was part of the discussion but many scientists and even religious representatives were brought into the discussion and in the process of making the law, pretty much every country has something similar, it's just good-sense to have someone who understands the matter around when you make a law, Arthur probably was the one to present the law with the definition of ‘muggle artifacts' because he knew how to better make his case in the political sphere and thus became in a very simplified way the one to ‘define' what counts as a muggle artifact, if he was given the power to literally decide case-by-case he wouldn't need to fear that his car was illegal because /he/ would be the one to decide if it was or not illegal.

The whole reason people don't speak the name "Voldemort" is that he put a taboo on his name, so every time someone says it he not only knows about it, he also knows the general area it happened.

That's the reason every single time someone in Harry's group says it they get attacked, like in the coffee shop and the forest.

This is in no way a method to track random citizens, and I'm not sure anyone in the ministry even knows how to reverse it or take control of it, otherwise, they would have done so after Voldemort was defeated the first time.

In the end there are three possible explanations for the hunts having success, either the wizarding population is much higher than the estimated, they have means of tracking people or they were just popping randomly around UK while high on Félix Felicis (which is also kind of a way of tracking I guess), no other way they managed to cover so much ground.

You're still conflating the Harry Potter universe with real life, it isn't. There everyone has the same weapon with a multitude of ways to cause harm.

Plus the entire fundament of discussing HP or any fandom is exactly immersing and trying to understand what is happening in-world (or raging against JKR) what we don't have information enough to say for sure we apply verisimilitude and logic to deduce by using logic and thinking through about how the society and culture would have developed with the building-blocks we know. /YOU/ started the discussion about in-world logic and mechanics, what I proposed wasn't a discussion, was a prompt, not gonna lie, I quite like to discuss the inner-workings of JKR's magical world and make theories, plus the muggle vs magicals debate always brings with it interesting points (culturally, militarily, economically...), so I welcome the change in subject, but the fact is that if you were the one who started the discussion about in-universe logic you can't then be the one to say that since it is a fictional universe we can't apply real-world logic to it.

** I agree with you, and it's such a shame that the muggles never join forces with the wizards because you could get some great inventions:

- Have a gun enchanted with infinite ammo, no maintenance, etc, along with enchants to prevent transfiguration, disarming, etc
- Enchant the gun to have no recoil
- Have the bullets enchanted to shoot through protego
- Have the bullets use a combination of LIDAR (IIRC most shields emit light in the visible spectrum) and portkeys to detect and teleport through shields
- Have the bullets autoaim (e.g. titanfall smart pistol)
- Have the bullets geminio themselves upon leaving the barrel
- Make the bullets and gun soundless, which includes the sonic boom of supersonic ammunition, the ignition of the primer, etc.
- Make the bullets explode with a space compressed pocket of high yield explosive upon encountering the target
- Make the bullets invisible
- Make the gun invisible
- Enchant the gun to not produce muzzle flash, and the bullets to not make shock waves
- Enchant the bullets to have 'infinite' velocity, allowing them to track and eliminate their target even if halfway across the country
- Say 'fuck the gun' and make a small invisible piece of barrel that is enchanted to be able to fire bullets and directly connect with the user's mind in order to fire, thus allowing the gun to be used even when the user does not have their hands free
- Mount the enchanted barrel on your shoulder
- Completely get rid of the bullet and just have tiny spheres (nanometer size) of space compressed high explosive that portkey into a target and explode

With all of this, you have an infinite ammo gun that requires no maintenance, that can shoot through any shield, attack multiple targets at the same time, even a single bullet can kill an elephant, is undetectable through both visual and auditory means, requires little to no training or effort to use, can kill pretty much anyone on Earth at any time, is unable to be destroyed with transfiguration or removed via a disarming curse, and is just really, really cool.

Conjuration.

  We do see spells that can go through shield charms but they tend to be complex and powerful.
#+end_quote

Keyword here is spell. A bullet isn't a spell. As shields like Protego hang off the body a bit, they do not perfectly cover the skin and thus can be bypassed with high-accuracy portkeying.

#+begin_quote
  Enchanted items tend to be simple spells or relatively simple unless the wizard has extreme skill.
#+end_quote

Then get someone with extreme skill to enchant the gun. Also, considering this is /Harry Potter/, the series with possibly the softest magic system in existence, it's likely doable.

#+begin_quote
  An invisible gun would be silly.
#+end_quote

I'm sorry, what? Ok, you try shooting a wizard who can plainly see your gun. It's much harder when they know what you're using and how to counter it.

#+begin_quote
  Infinite velocity would mean they break faster.

Unbreakability charms.

*** ... And I here thinking that my idea of getting infinite energy by enchanting a turbine to move at high-speeds forever, having perfect efficiency by making it impossible for energy to be converted in heat, and turn weight and space in general into a non-issue this permitting cheep space-exploration was outlandish... sure, your gun sounds cool, it would be just get one and look at the list of most wanted plus the world's greatest assholes, just one thing, making the bullet's velocity infinite would either reduce it to it's atoms instantly or cause an explosion roughly big enough to end the world, maybe both, even light-speed would be troublesome.

***** Yeah, but... wouldn't this kind of take away the reason for using this speed at all? I mean the advantage of having something moving at high speed instead of teleporting is to make it so when the thing hits the energy is transferred as impact, having it not break the universe or transfer less energy while keeping the teleportation feature would just be kind of pointless in this instance I guess.

** I have to disagree with you on this one chief. Just like the average human is not a Navy Seal or has intimate knowledge of how modern weaponry can be best used, wizards don't either when it comes to combat. I have no doubt that wizards are more durable than muggles are, but resisting bullets? No way. Weapons similar to nukes? Maybe, but dropping a missile on everything is not a good answer when it comes to defeating an enemy. Especially when you dealing with HUGE and spread out militaries. Mind control? Only a specialized wizard can truly weaponize it, and muggle intelligence is very much decentralized and recorded on online and offline sources all the time, it's literally procedure. One on one, wizards curbstomp muggles, but some aurors vs a platoon of muggles? Not gonna work out well for the wizards. The only muggle organizations wizards are taking out without a problem are insurgency-like forces like the Taliban or ISIS or the NRA. Not actual militaries LMAO. You're overestimating wizard fighting population and skill, only about a hundred thousand of them in the world can actually fight, out of like a few million wizards tops.

*** Ignoring the population size debate that I never found much sense in, that's why the prompt specified that what protects them is enchanted clothing, not shield charms, and a couple thousands that can easily wipe out many cities per day is definitely better, to say nothing about weapons like mandrakes that kill anything on the auditory range or dementor's that literally cause mass panic while eating souls and can't be killed or even seen by muggles.

Plus, with teleportation and enchantments that actually make it impossible for anyone to find or affect the location no matter the means or effort spent they can do everything at their leisure, Hell, with the power to not only throw nukes around, but also survive them and fix the damage they have no reason to /not/ go nuts with it /the second/ a war starts. And the information problem would again be a two-way street, muggles would also have no idea of how to fight magicals and wars generally are ended more often by causing enough damage to the enemy's supply lines rather than complete annihilation (which magicals would have a great advantage with).

** Makes no sense for a bullet to be stopped normally really. Arrows would make somewhat sense, given that centaurs and perhaps other warring tribes hundreds of years back used them, so it was developed into the material. Bullets? No so much.

***** I think everything in the HP universe has some degree of magical significance. We know, for example, that Lily's sacrifice acted as a counter-spell to the Killing Curse, even though it was not a "spell" in the usual sense of waving a wand and speaking an incantation. It was simply an action she took, but because of the meaning of that action combined with the fact that she was a witch, it had magical power.

Love, bravery, debt... all these day to day actions which wizards take have magical significance to them. Magic isn't just something a wizard does as a performative activity, but rather it suffuses their lives, which operate more on fairy tale/storybook logic than the objective mechanical universe we see in real life.

In contrast, we also know that things can also vary in the extent to which they are non-magical. Pigs, for example, are [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/pure-blood][said to be]] highly unmagical, and I suspect the various comments about the Dursleys being increadibly Muggleish are, in addition to being obvious jokes, comments on how incredibly non-magical they are - the type of Muggle who can't even see magic when it is happening right in front of their eyes.

With all this in mind, it seems to me that arrows and swords are substantially more romantic and fantastical in nature than guns, and therefore likely to have more magical significance. Guns are just so clearly products of Muggle science and industry that they seem to me obvious candidates for identification as incredibly non-magical objects, in the same category as pigs.

*** I feel like a charm or enchantment to stop an arrow would work by slowing/stopping the velocity of the object. And I personally feel like magic wouldn't care if an object is going 70 meter/sec vs or 500 m/s.

**** The problem is that it's much more energy-intensive to stop a bullet than an arrow, and bullets pack more power than a volley of arrows ever could.

And that's the small caliber stuff, there are handguns out there that can punch through a fridge, a wall, and then kill their target.

And that's without even mentioning high caliber rifles.
