I'm looking for some good Severus fics. Any pairing is fine, preferably something where he's the main or second main character. Bonus points if we get stuff from his point of view. Extra bonus if he's amazingly in character.

Romance not needed but appreciated. Favorite pairings are: Severus/Hermione Severus/Harry


** Oh you'll like Of a Linear Circle have you read that? Or any of Flamethrowers work??

They have a lot of Severus focussed fics where they give him you know, motivation and personality and actually explore his spying life and why he's good at Potions and reasons for being a dick in the books. There's a romance pairing too. A lot of other shit happens but it's there üòä

In OaCL there is so much magic and lore and mystery and you will just ADORE Nizar I promise! It's brilliant. If your a Snape fan you'll like this.

*** [[/u/WhistlingBanshee]], I have found an error in your comment:

It is true that it might have been better if you, WhistlingBanshee, had typed ‚ÄúIf +your+ [*you're*] a Snape‚Äù instead. ‚ÄòYour' is possessive; ‚Äòyou're' means ‚Äòyou are'.

** I strongly second the recommendation for Of a Linear Circle. Can't recommend it enough.

In approximate order of Snape's age (and I've just decided these need to be direct links because I've got too many):

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3570937][The Better Man]] by Laume (Gen, unfinished): starts with student Snape, then goes into Hogwarts era. Mentor Snape.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2269161][Dreams]] by Sheankelor (SS/HP): starts as a child, goes until after Harry finishes a Mastery. Harry is a dream-walker, but time does not pass the same for them.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/289292][Out of the Bag]] by IIBNF (Gen): student Snape hates Transfiguration class
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12771684][Advice from an Old-Timer]] by Sheankelor (Gen): new spy Snape. Also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12730972][on FFN]]
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8897536][Mipsy's Last Day]] by Iulia Linnea (Gen): new teacher Snape. Character death (not Snape).

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3160980][Hindsight]] by Loralee (Gen, mentor): Snape gets a visit from his future self.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8707789][Six, Revisited]] by Warviben (Gen, mentor): Snape takes care of de-aged (16yo) Harry
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12217672][An Hour of Snape]] by DesertC (SS/HG): 7th-year Hermione has an appointment with Draco's polyjuice sex business. NSFW
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/289348][Fancy a Fuck?]] by IIBNF (SS/XH): Snape and Hooch give each other a go, despite both being gay. NSFW
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/93822][Disenchanted]] by Cluegirl (SS/HP, underage, student): Snape rescues Harry, who has managed to turn himelf into a cat. Unspecified teenage Harry. NSFW

Post-war era:

** A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles, linkffn(7937889) has him as a main character. The story is however canon compliant so there are no such pairings. Actually the romance is quite minor and restricted to a few chapters.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.
