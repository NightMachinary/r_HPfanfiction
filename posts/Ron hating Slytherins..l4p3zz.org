Is it ever mentioned anywhere in Canon that Ron hates Slytherins and thinks all of them are evil incarnate?

I've read one too many Fics with the same bloody line "Ron's blind hate for Slytherin" and I really can't remember the kid ever hating them, calling them dirty snakes, or evil incarnate.

I've found it in nearly every fic in some form or the other.

I'm not sure if it's because if it's been a while since I read the books, but if anyone has any information on whether this hatred is canon, please let me know.


** Ron has a bit of bias against Slytherin in the first book because he's worried what his family will think of him if he ends up there. But other than his hatred for Malfoy, and by extent of Crabbe and Goyle, he seems to be even less biased than Harry who thinks that all of them are evil blood purists or fat ugly half-trolls.

** He hates Malfoy, that's a given, but it's canon Harry who's actually far more biased against Slytherins, and it's evident in the entire series.

Ron got bashed in the movies (kind like a version of fanfics too), and then a lot more by his haters (who are often influenced by the movies) in their fanfics. One such invented item is his supposed bias against Slytherins.

Ron's grandmother is Cedrella Black, highly likely a Slytherin, so I doubt he really wants to shit on her too.

** I see a lot in the general fandom, not so much this sub, that actually Draco was a nice boy who just acted a little bit bigoted because of his mean mean abusive parents. So when Ron gets upset at Malfoy for yelling slurs at Hermione, he's overreacting so much that a second explanation is required, that he must have an unfair prejudice against all Slytherins.

Edit: I don't think stabbing Draco in the face in that scene would have been an overreaction. I'm speaking as my hypothetical strawman Draco fan when I say that.

Draco may not have had bagels but he had two years already surrounded by half bloods and muggleborns who were clearly no worse at magic than he was. I think there's something special about him that makes him worse than most people to deny his environment and maintain that level of hate.

** Canonically, Harry is the biased one - he basically paints all of Slytherin with the "Draco Malfoy, Pansy Parkinson, and Draco Malfoy's Goons" brush from the start, partially because of Draco Malfoy (who makes a bad first impression and then says he's going into Slytherin), and partially because Hagrid, the first adult whose opinion he trusts, says that (paraphrased) all evil wizards were Slytherins.

Ron doesn't actually hate all of Slytherin (at least, he's not stated to) - but, of all of Slytherin House, he only ever really /interacts/ with Draco Malfoy plus goons - who he has pretty good reason to hate beyond just "they're in Slytherin".

Harry, having always wanted a family, rolls with it, and Dobby being Dobby, is overjoyed Harry wants to hang out with him. Eventually it becomes a normal sight to see Harry and Dobby hanging out in the library or the common room doing homework together, with Dobby occasionally cursing a book to stick to his face so he actually reads his books or the like, which Dobby insists is for his own good (Dobby's homework probably consists of designing horrible outfits for Dumbledore or something)

1) Harry and Dobby go through a blood ritual, but it has side effects and they both get a glow-up. This makes Dobby look like Handsome Squidward. 2) Possibly in the same story as 1, Dumbledore takes Harry on as an apprentice. He brings Dobby along, he then becomes Dumbledore's Personal Tailor because their styles are both eccentric. For some reason Dobby's eclectic tastes catch on as a fashion fad and he becomes successful, stumbling arse backwards into more progress for elf rights. 3) Bonus points for an expansive elf/fairy world than just House-elves, the rest just keep out of the way in Forests and Woods like Carterhaugh. Wizards just managed to capture and enslave some Brownies which possibly resulted in house elf slavery.

** Well. In book-canon, the (in)famous line /“There's not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.”/ is Hagrid's, not Ron's.

Ron /does/ show antipathy from the get-go (PS, train):

#+begin_quote
  “What house are your brothers in?” asked Harry.

  “Gryffindor,” said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. “Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don't know what they'll say if I'm not. I don't suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.”

  “That's the house Vol---, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?”

  “Yeah,” said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.
#+end_quote

Given that 11 y old's opinions hardly are their own, this tells us also something about the Weasleys as a whole, and/or the kind of people they socialise with.

And of course, from here on out, it doesn't get better, because of Draco & co. Still, I would hesitate to call it "hatred". It's a rivalry, a dislike, a mutual looking-down-on-the-respective-other-house -- ultimately, a clash of ideals and values, and the degree to which one "dislikes" that corresponds to the ability to leave people with different mindsets be.

And more to the point, I would not ascribe to Ron any /particular/ dislike of Slytherin, other than the specific dislike of Draco, and the generic one that has existed forever (HBP):

#+begin_quote
  Zabini did not make any sign of recognition or greeting, nor did Harry or Neville: Gryffindor and Slytherin students loathed each other on principle.
#+end_quote

(Pottermore Slytherin Welcome Message):

#+begin_quote
  Now, a lot of people say that Slytherins and Gryffindors represent two sides of the same coin. Personally, I think Gryffindors are nothing more than wannabe Slytherins. Mind you, some people say that Salazar Slytherin and Godric Gryffindor prized the same kinds of students, so perhaps we are more similar than we like to think. But that doesn't mean that we cosy up with Gryffindors. They like beating us only slightly less than we like beating them.
#+end_quote

You also asked whether Ron thinks they are all "evil". I feel this can be answered -- taking the POV that the Anti-Voldemort side is "good" -- with a /yes/, But this will be simply due to what reality is like, because it is a factual truth that basically all Slytherins are (again, from aforementioned POV) bigots and racists.

And as for insults, no one ever calls Slytherins "snakes" or "slimy snakes", which would be a misnomer in any case (snakes are never slimy, they are reptiles). Just one time (GoF, the Qudditch WC), Ron calls the Malfoys "slimy gits".

*** I actually disagree with that being antipathy. That's anxiety about upsetting his parents. His parents have house pride, and want their kids in their old house.

**** Hmm ... I'm not sure there is a meaningful difference. Leaving aside the reason, Ravenclaw is okay for Ron, Slytherin isn't. That's what I'd define as an antipathy, even if the reason only is not wanting to upset his family.

The motivation for this antipathy of the Weasleys, in turn, isn't stated (beyond the general historic dislike between Gryffindor and Slytherin, resp. the values those sides represent). But given that canonically, almost all Slytherins /do/ have similar mindsets to Malfoy, it doesn't seem far-fetched to assume that this is a source of it.

That was what I meant; from the POV of the Weasleys, disliking Slytherins makes actual sense.

** It's a mix of things - as usual in fanfiction. It starts with impressions from canon (where Ron is not fond of Slytherins, of course), which then gets used in fanfiction. That aspect becomes more important to his character, with writers/readers picking it up and exaggerating it over time. Plus, the Weasleys are often exaggerated into becoming a super light side family, which exaggerates in turn their view of Slytherins.

Narratively, it also makes sense for Ron (and/or Hermione) to be more anti-Slytherin than in the books. I don't mind having more antagonism there (though the dumb bashing version is obviously bad). Having one of Harry's two best friends react more negatively towards Slytherin is a fun inclusion in fics where some of those characters take on a more sympathetic angle, as it can add tension/conflict in a fairly natural way. Just tends to be Ron there - likely because he has a heated temper that manifested itself a few times in turning away from Harry for a limited period of time, so people find it more fitting for that to happen than Hermione I assume.

A lot of it does depend on how we view the first conflict with Voldemort, and how that affected Wizarding society.

The rest are portrayed as racist, unpleasant, brutish etc. It is one of the reasons why fanon Slytherins are upgraded in 9/10 cases, because they are just cartoonishly evil in the books.

Book 7 has Voldemort telling Lucius only Draco didn't join up to fight for the death eaters in the battle of Hogwarts.

As such the entire trio is heavily against Slytherins literally all of the time, Hermione, Harry, Ron never do anything but be in an antagonistic relationship with them, admittedly usually instigated by some Slytherins being evil for conflicts sake.

Why this trait is usually the one tied to Ron? Well probably because it is most likely for him to be prejudiced, given that he grew up in that world, and thus it makes the most sense if you're gonna call him out on hating Slytherins in years 1-2.

If you want to work with a Ron who is in a strong negative light you usually have to use either Slytherin hate or jealousy (or bad eating habits and stupidity if you are in a rush). Now since there is not much for Ron to be jealous of Harry in books 1/2 you take what's left.

**** Well Andromeda isn't a Slytherin in the books just in the extended universe, and even then we have very little first hand insight into her character. I mean in the later books JRO makes an effort to somehow not have "Slytherins bad, Hufflepufs useless" but the early books have Slytherins described as an "unpleasant lot" from Harry's sorting night, Slytherin quarelling with the other founders cuz he is extra racist etc.

The Harry Potter books are rather shallow because they are in essence a children's book with a murder mystery. It is why imo fanon is so successful, you can explore endless hidden depths of any character you want, considering most of them only have a basic description.

** Wait. I totally understand that Ron isn't actually a Slytherin hating bigot and that it's just a fanon theory. But basically every post in this thread is saying that Harry is the one who was /really/ anti Slytherin, but I don't exactly remember anything like that either. Could someone post some specific examples of times Harry showcased his discrimination?

So if Harry did have a bad view, it would be justified to an extent. But yeah technically it's Harry who disliked Slytherins.

Lol. This just gave "the hat wanted me in Slytherin" trope and Haphne shippers a whole new twist.

I also really hate the "the hat wanted to put me in Slytherin" thing. The hat never mentioned Slytherin until Harry brought it up saying he didn't want to go there! The hat just asks him if he is sure. I guess Harry did think it in his second year though.

**** That's a failing of canon. Yes, it does treat Slytherin as the always-evil house, which is /garbage/. The only Slytherins who appear on screen without being various shades of evil, from subtle to cackling, are Snape and Slughorn - both of whom are at least deep grey. I wish we could say that that's just because of the limitations of Harry's point of view. But then the entire house walks out on the Battle of Hogwarts rather than help.

Yay for a series that's all about fighting discrimination...

The Slytherins aren't really persecuted or treated in a worse way than the other houses on a daily basis.

******** I'm replying here, cause I don't know if they have blocked you or not, and well, you're always fun to chill with on these threads.

Ron is capable of having friends outside his own immediate circle. He's the most sociable of the trio.

​

I really don't understand their point of "Luna is a wonderful being". She's not a pushover or an angel. She's just an odd person that we enjoy reading. Also, I doubt Luna would be overly eager to be friends with Slytherins either, seeing that she was captured, probably tortured, and held hostage by the Malfoys.

​

As for the defence of Draco... What? You can reconcile with a character that says "You'll be next mudbloods" with glee when faced with the prospect of his classmates dying, but you're willing to think Ron would never stop hating Slytherins because of a sentence he said before school even started?

​

A sentence and sentiment echoing Hagrid, who indeed is an angel with the biggest heart of all?

​

Also, Draco's family chose to follow Voldemort? Even when Voldemort was gone they chose to follow and advocate blood purity? (Books 1-4). Draco bought into the ideology himself. He also wasn't scared of killing people. I really hate that misconception.

​

He was scared of failing the task set by Voldemort. He didn't care who died in the process - Katie, Ron.

******** 'Yes because he does, with Luna' That's not what I meant. I wasn't talking about Ron becoming friends with someone from another House, I was saying can you realistically think Ron or any other person could try to become friends with a Slytherin? Aside from Luna, she's a wonderful being. 'Yeah, as long as they aren't garbage people like Malfoy' Okay. Goodbye. I'm blocking you. I don't like blocking people, but I won't get into an argument about DRACO a 16 year old boy who had not only his life but his parents' life threatened by a pasty sociopath missing his smeller.

********* Because Draco Malfoy wasn't an horrible kid even before sixth year?

Because Luna is just an exception?

​

Listen, it's simple really. First of all, 'All the darks witches and wizards come from Slytherin' was saif by Hagrid, not Ron.

Second of all, Malfoy wished for the death of all muggleborns. Not only in second year, but in every years bar the last one, and that one is a maybe.

Third, Luna isn't a wonderful being of lights, butterflies, and rainbows. She's a /child/, and more than that a /child at heart/, who cannot manage to get out of her fantasy world. Sure, she's a great character, gentle and all that jazz, but making her some perfect being is bad.

Fourth, yeah I can imagine Ron befriending a Slytherin. They would just need to not be bigoted, not spray bad rumours about his current friends, and all around be a pleasant person to be around. Cite one such canon Slytherin.

Fifth, you kinda asked him at first "anybody else from another house", I'll say the DA speaks for itself

Sixth, blocking people is cringe, and the only purpose it serves is to prove to everyone that you're a whiny kid who can't accept he's wrong. "You're making me block you, because you say bad stuff" = "I don't like what you say, so I never want to see you again."

​

And remember, you get what you asked for. Malfoy asked to follow "a pasty sociopath missing his smeller". The three of them did, in fact. Well, if they don't like the results, it's their faults to begin with.
