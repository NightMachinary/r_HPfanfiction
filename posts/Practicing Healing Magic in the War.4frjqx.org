Are there any good fics where the younger generation learn healing magic as a part of training for the war? I'm imagining some of the earlier generation (Sirius, Snape, etc.) coming back injured and Harry and Hermione immediately starting to cast diagnostic charms. But, I'll be happy with anything where some of Harry's generation learns some healing magic and uses it during the war.

EDIT: Does not need to be a main plot point in the story. I would like them to know healing magic as a part of a larger war effort.

  A year has passed since the dead started returning to life. The fate of those hoping to survive and rebuild rests on the best and the worst of humanity, both wizards and Muggles, with their political ideologies and the ravenous undead in between, and it's up to Healer Harry Potter to save as many as he can in the crossfire. A Harry Potter Zombie Apocalypse Fanfiction. HP/AG.

** Any objection to often unfavorable pairings like HGSS? Because I'm rereading linkffn(chasing the sun by loten) and a very big part of the premise is Hermione training in healing at the school under Pomfrey (specifically for the war!)

But I'm rereading it because I'm at the point where it's difficult to separate stories in my head so I can't reliably tell you about the rest :P

  AU, from Order of the Phoenix onwards. Hermione only wanted to learn Healing; she discovers that Professor Snape is a human being after all, and his actions dramatically shape the course of the war as events unfold. Complete.

** Hermione works as a healer in the later stages of Self Slain Gods on Strange Altars (by Scumblackentropy) when her PTSD leaves her unwilling in combat. Cho does too from memory. It's a beautiful but hard fic - especially as it is abandoned.

  What do you want me to say, Granger? That you are mine and I am yours? You are. I am. Let's not fuck around.

** I've read a few but don't remember the names. One or two were really good if I remember right, especially one where Harry wanted to be a healer.
