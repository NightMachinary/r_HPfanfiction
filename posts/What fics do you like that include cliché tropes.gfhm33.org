It can just be a badly written fic that you like for some unfathomable reason, or a fic that includes like, goblin King Harry, but is still a good fic despite the powerwank.


** ffn(The Pureblood Pretense by murkybluematter) and its sequels have a very OP genius fem!Harry with a lord-level magical core doing Slytherin politics at 11 years old, and it's...possibly my favorite series in the whole world. It's an incredibly well-written and detail-rich alternate universe with amazing original characters.

I think one of the points of it was exactly to take some clichés and write them well (the /main/ point being a fusion with Tamora Pierce's Song if the Lioness books, though you don't need to know anything about them).

** linkffn(11191235)

Good fic, the last bit is significantly better than the start of the fic. Harry Potter displays genius levels of absolute bullshit but... the storytelling is brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Accidental Animagus (linkao3(14078862)) has fairly egregious kid-politicians, but it does it about as realistically as can be expected and the fic itself is really well-written.

The Thorny Rose (linkffn(9631998) has Ron being practically a Death Eater for the majority of the fic (There's a reason for it, though), makes Ginny hypercompetent while making Dumbledore seem like an old fool, does a bit of low-key soulbond stuff by the third story in the trilogy, and makes a really good read despite all that.

  Harry has been entered into the Triwizard Tournament against his will, and his friends don't believe him when he insists he didn't enter his name. Will Ginny Weasley sit by and watch him suffer alone, or will she risk exposing the dark secret she has been hiding. GoF re-write from Ginny's POV. Smart & slightly manipulative Ginny! Extreme Ron-bashing!

  What will happen when a goblin-raised Harry arrives at Hogwarts. A Harry who has received training, already knows the prophecy and has no scar. With the backing of the goblin nation and Hogwarts herself. Complete.
