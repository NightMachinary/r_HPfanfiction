Harry in this would lose that Gryffindor bravery and curiosity that was so precious of a trait. He becomes passive, and uninvolved, and uncaring to a great degree; He's floating, like a jellyfish. In dangerous situations, he goes to teachers and asks for help, and after they dismiss his claims, he returns to his dormitory, thinking about what Snape's punishment would be if he caught Harry out and about. Ginny dies in the chamber, Draco Malfoy starts fights that Harry walks away from, and upon being asked to deal with Voldemort, Harry cites that it is the responsibility of adults, and that he is just a child. The Dursleys are found out, after Snape worries over how his behaviour has affected Harry and gets to the bottom of Harry's abusive past, and Harry lives with Snape. He's too quiet, refuses to speak unless prompted, and exists in Snape's house like a ghost. He realises what his uncaring behaviour has done, and the author can take it how they like from there; maybe Harry gets therapy, maybe he is stuck like that until he manages to escape, maybe Snape learns from the errors of his ways and attempts to change but fails and falls back into old habits. Who knows?


** I remember one fanfic that had Snape give Harry a spanking.

After the beatings Harry had received at the hands of the Dursleys, his response was something along the lines of, "That's it?"

**** There's two I have to link.

The one shot [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4307359/1/Harry-s-First-Detention][/Harry's First Detention/]] and followed up by a much longer sequel fanfic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4437151/1/Harry-s-New-Home][/Harry's New Home/]].

Mind you, a more painful experience than a spanking is part of the one shot, but it's unjustified, and the character who inflicted it acknowledges they were wrong.

After that point, Snape is basically forces to see Harry for the abused little boy he is, rather than the spoiled brat he perceived him to be.

By the way, this fic is /not/ for those that take corporal punishment as 100% wrong all the time. Snape does use corporal punishment(namely spanking) to reinforce the boundaries he sets for Harry. Due to my own personal history, I don't view this as a big issue, but some might disagree.

***** I do take issue with corporal punishment 100% of the time, but I'm okay with reading stuff that I might find upsetting, even stuff that is framed in a way I dislike. Keeps my mind open to new ideas, I think, so I don't get stuck. Thanks for the rec!

****** Yeah. I'm just not the same. I don't have any children myself, so I don't really have much experience beyond my own childhood, but I feel like spanking is acceptable, so long as the chastised child is able to sit comfortably after a couple minutes, but anything beyond that is unacceptable.

I've more than once wanted to punch an adult in the face for slapping a child across the face. People bringing belts or canes into it are right out.

******* I just think it'd be ineffective. Young children learn more, usually, from actions, from role-models, than just from words. I feel like spanking a child is like saying "you can solve this issue with violence", and might lead to aggression, or other behavioural issues. There's a saying I hear sometimes that "Kids who hit, get hit", and it's not always true, but a lot of the time, it will be. Idk, that's just my view on it, I don't find it an effective form of punishment, at least if you want to teach lasting lessons.

******** Well, I will also say that my mother was one who slapped in the face. I do NOT condone that method of so-called discipline. It is simply demeaning and nothing more than an attack. So it's not just that I was spanked that makes me feel that spanking is acceptable: it's that, as an adult, I can look back and acknowledge that it was an effective deterrent FOR ME.

******* I once talked to a social worker, and where he lived they had actually codified acceptable corporal punishment into law: it had to be with the bare hand, on the buttocks, and as I recall limited the number of strikes allowed. As Snape says in the cited stories, it's intended to get the child's attention, not to injure them.

As somebody who was told at 16 I was not too old to spank (although I wasn't on that occasion), all I can say is that the threat of spanking worked for me as a deterrent. It doesn't work for all children.

******** Basically there's no one true way to raise children. What works for one child won't necessarily work for another. Children are people and people are all unique, so it stands to reason that what would be an effective punishment for one child would be completely ineffective for another.
