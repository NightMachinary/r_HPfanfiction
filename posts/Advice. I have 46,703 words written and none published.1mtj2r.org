I spent the last couple months just writing and writing, but I've never published a fan fic before (of any type). I'm about 1/3 to 1/2 of the way through with what I'm considering "Book 1" of a fic series.

I'm worried that I will not gain any readers and all this time will be wasted; but I also do not wish to publish until I'm done with "Book 1".

So I'm looking for advice on what to do. Should I begin publishing to try and gain some traction in readership? Should I wait until "book 1" is finished (estimating another 30,000-40,000 words will be needed)?

Should I try and find an editor on here to read through what I've written and make corrections/suggestions before publishing? Is this something people do?

General advice would be great, and I'll answer any questions that are asked.


** First, congratulations!! That's a great wordcount and a worthy goal. As for advice, I would definitely find someone to beta read or edit before you post anywhere. No matter how experienced the author, it's a rare one (in my corner of fandom anway) who doesn't have someone look it over for SPaG at the very least.

You haven't mentioned the type of story you're writing. Is it gen? Is it het? Is is slash? The type of story will go along way in determining where to post. Most stories are posted to fanfiction.net, unless they're slash and/or explicit. If you are writing slash or a story with graphic violence, both of which violate FFN's terms of service, many of the authors have moved or are moving to AO3.org (Archive of our Own). They accept any rating and any pairing--or no pairing at all.

As for posting, you can either post regularly, like a chapter a week, to gain some traction, or you can put it up as a chaptered fic. I've found that putting up 50K words as a one-shot can put some people off.

I hope you find some of this helpful.

*** Thank you, but I'm far from done.

How should one go about acquiring a "beta reader"?

It's set in the future of the HP world (all of Harry's kids have graduated Hogwarts). While I do involve some of the characters from the canon story (Neville is a professor, Harry makes an appearance or two) the characters we all know and love are not in any way the focus of the story. I have been trying to keep the focus on my characters.

Ideally, though this may be unrealistic, I would like for there to be 7 books. I am mimicking the structure of JK Rowling by following one character and writing mostly through their eyes. This means the storyline in book 1 will be decidedly less complex than will the storyline in book 7.

I follow my main character (who is NOT a Mary Sue, I promise) as she journeys to Hogwarts and gets herself wound up in her own sorts of drama. I will be remaining within canon restrictions set down by JKR where they are known to exist, and creating my own rules and nuances where JKR has not yet ventured while trying to remain in the spirit of canon (meaning I won't be creating exploits that allow for characters to suddenly dominate over a given field).

As I'm following a girl who begins the story at age 11, there is nothing explicit in the story and there won't be for a few years of her life at least. Keeping with the JKR tradition most of the romance will remain fairly tame on that front when and if it does come. No explicit sex scenes for now, and likely none ever. I'm a little bit more descriptive in this area than JKR is by nature, but when and if the time comes to write those scenes I don't plan to overdo it.

I like the idea of one chapter a week. Currently I am working on chapter 12 averaging a little more than 4,000 words a chapter. I have 19 chapters planned, but I may need to add a chapter depending on a decision I have coming up. I am also considering adding another chapter so that there is more "regular school" going on. Right now I feel like there is too much story advancing and not enough story building. We'll see.

So the question becomes whether or not I should hold off on starting posting or not. Should I find a beta reader and begin posting as soon as she/he is finished with the chapter, or should I hold off? It's taken me about 9 weeks to get through 11 complete, unedited chapters. I kind of fear that with a chapter a week the readers will catch up with me if my pace slows.

What do you think?

**** Ooooh! Original fic set in the wizarding world! Excellent!

First, finding a beta reader is not terribly onerous. I know that betas can register with FFN, though to be honest, I've never tried to find one through that site. I've found mine through trial and error.

I started posting my first HP story on hpfandom.net (and I really should have mentioned that site) and within a couple of chapters, a reader volunteered to beta for me. I joined a community on Livejournal, which is still surprisingly active in the HP world, and found another one through there. Or you can do what you're doing and post requests here. Judging from your post, I suspect your story is already very tight, though it never hurts to have another set of eyes look it over and ask questions. What the reader sees and what the author intended aren't always the same thing.

As far as posting, let me share with you my experiences. I started a novel and posted each chapter as I finished it. Two years later, it's still a WIP (work in progress). A few stories later, I signed up for what's called a "Big Bang Fest" put on by my ship's LJ community, wrote a 235K word story, and posted it a chapter a week knowing it was already finished. My suggestion? Wait until you're finished with Book 1 before posting it, and that includes editing it (though I tinkered like hell as I was posting). In the meantime, I keep signing up for fests and my poor WIP sits there, patiently waiting for me to return to it.

In the meantime, keep writing! The Harry Potter fandom might be shrinking, but it's still healthy and stories are added to it daily.

***** I think I'll take your advice and wait until I finish the book to post.

How rapidly is the fandom shrinking do you think? I know it's obviously going to decline now that the final movie is collecting dust on everyone's selves, but I was thinking that Harry Potter was this generation's Star Wars... meaning that it will be relevant and loved for decades.

******* And if it's anything like Middle Earth, fandom will see another big bump when it's released.

I agree that HP is much like Star Wars/Star Trek. There will always be people writing and creating for it, especially since we have the Marauder's and NextGen eras to play in, as well as the canon years to explore. Judging /solely/ by the goings on in my little corner of the sandbox, I'd say that productivity is down by about 20% from two years ago, but that's still a goodly number of stories being written.

** If you have the patience, I strongly recommend that you hold off posting until you have the first book complete. The times I've done this, the final product was more polished, more internally consistent, and ultimately more popular than when I've not. As a bonus you can publish on a faster schedule, say a chapter a week, and it's easier to find a beta reader willing to read a complete work than a partial work. Readers will follow even a sub-par story if the update rate is fast (see, e.g., the popularity of Darth Marrs's Firebird series, which updates like clockwork every Saturday). And they will get more excited and invested in a story that way.

As for advice on the story itself: edit, edit, edit. Ten passes through--tightening prose, sounding out dialogue, ensuring characters are in character, ensuring the plot is consistent--isn't excessive at all. Make the final product as polished as possible, something you're proud of. Good writing will attract more readers.

When you do start to publish, recognize that if you're new to publishing fanfiction, it's going to take some time to build up a set of readers. Promoting your story in various forums, e.g. here, will help. Consider posting your story on more than one archive; I recommend fanfiction.net as a minimum, as it has by far the largest number of readers. But check the sidebar for this subreddit and see if there are other archives that would make sense for your story. Spend time on your summary--make it interesting so readers will want to check out your story and ensure there are no errors. Make sure your story is properly categorized; a lot of readers apply filters when searching for new stories. Finally, search through the list of popular C2s for your fandom and see whether any make sense for your story. If you find one or more that do, send an inquiry to the manager of the C2 and ask whether they would be willing to add your story to their list. Getting your story onto popular lists like this helps a lot with traffic.

And don't get discouraged if your first chapters don't see a large number of hits or reviews. My first few pieces languished for months before I started attracting readers and it's taken years for my stories to acquire a million hits and a decent number of reviews. Unless you're very fortunate, success won't happen overnight (much like in traditional publishing).

*** There's a lot of great advice here. I would never have thought to contact the C2 managers about adding stories to their lists, but the inner workings of FFn tend to escape me.

*** I'm sorry, I'm new to this... what is a C2?

I do plan on waiting until I finish to start posting, despite my paranoia. [[/u/won]]'t_eat_bugs talked me into it.

Thanks for your technical advice, I'll make sure to try and make it as widespread as possible upon posting. Relying on word of mouth would be silly, since there are so many fan fics online.

** Suggestions are already on the right track (though I posted as I was writing, but tried to stay at least 3 or 4 chapters ahead of the latest posted chapter. Doing that makes it easy to abandon the story for a while...)

As for Beta...another thing you can do is post the first chapter or summary to a yahoo group like CaerAzkaban and ask if anyone would like to beta
