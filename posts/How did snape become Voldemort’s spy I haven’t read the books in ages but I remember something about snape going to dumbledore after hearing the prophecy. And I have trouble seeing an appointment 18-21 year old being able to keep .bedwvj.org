We know why dumbledore trusts snape but why does Voldemort trust him?


** He joined the deatheathers after Hogwarts and Voldemort told him to apply as a teacher to have ears inside the castle. Before he had the interview spied Dumbledore and Trelawney and heard the prophesy

** Voldemort was good at legilimency, but Snape was better at occlumency. I don't find it hard to believe; age isn't the end all. It's like, you've got your twenty year old talented, famous superstar piano player prodigy, versus your 80 year old guitarest - or someone who doesn't play the piano at all. Just because they're older and can play a different instrument doesn't mean they won't be horrible compared to the super talented younger person!

** My assumption is that Severus was already naturally attuned to Occlumency and learned to master it before he turned in first place. My impression of his childhood is that it contained a lot of abuse and that he, over time, learned to school his emotions. We know for a fact that he lost control in anger at least once (Snape's Worst Memory), and probably other times as well. SWM in particular costed him a very dear friendship, and I can see him approach Occlumency as a means of preventing similar occurences in the future.

Then there is the matter of Severus' feelings for Lily -- a muggleborn -- at the point where he chooses to join Voldemort. I really can't see Voldemort /not/ Legilimizing recruits, and would he really let such an extensive friendship -- and likely yearning after the fallout -- just slide? My conclusion is that he had already mastered Occlumency to a point and that he decided to hide this part of him -- possibly subconsciously.

This is why I never really considered his turning without considering the matter of Occlumency, odd. And he isn't stupid, he would never return to Voldemort in first place if he wasn't confident that he could hide his turning from him.

** One of the best implementation of this idea is IMHO linkao3(Hatching Robin by Teao) (I am still not sure what to think about linkao3(Becoming Harriet by Teao), which is the main story of this series, there is too much porn for my taste in it).

  A young Severus makes yet another mistake, and discovers that it's not only joining the Death Eaters that has far-reaching consequences.This is a prequel to 'Becoming Harriet', dealing with Robin's early life. It's going to be episodic and fluffy, and will probably be most interesting if you've read at least a bit of Harriet!

** I think the reasoning is simpler than you are looking for.

Snape is brutish, antagonistic, skilled and pretty much oozes emo.

If you were Voldemort, why would you you think SNAPE of all people was a good guy helping James potter?
