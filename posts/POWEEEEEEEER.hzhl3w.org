*** Nope. This Harry is so absurdly OP that by second year he's saved a parallel reality by creating a ward baby that controls the planet, has more magic than 800,000 wizards combined, is the MOD, created his own aspects, and maybe even a tangible world in his mind(kinda vague). At this point he's more powerful than friggen gods. He's godlike to godlike entities. So a little more powerful than what OP was asking, but if he/her likes it, I might as well clue him/her in for what they're about to read.
