So yeah, [[/u/XaveMavee][u/XaveMavee]] asked for fics with the most OP Harry; I ended up writing a short snippet on the spot where Harry becomes super-ultra-godmodey-powered using the blood sacrifice of a an evil planet.

So I'm wondering, does anyone else want to write short stupid snippets where Harry becomes stupidly powerful? Maybe a gamer-fic style one where Harry does a certain 'make potion to boost potion making skill ad infinitium'?


** After hitting his head Harry went to bed, in his cubby under the stairs. His dreams vivid and full of wonder. Eldritch beings whispering in his mind.

Harry awoke as Dudley stomped down the stairs.

"Wake up freak!"

Harry instead turned back time and decided to sleep in.

Edit) Becomes, I see let's add a line at the beggining

*Harry's fourth year, with Harry having learned about the First Task a bit earlier...*

*In the library...*

"It's a charge spell," Hermione explained to Harry as she placed the book down on the table, "It...well, it uses a non-Euclidean space warp, like the Expansion Charm, to increase the area of your thaumic field relative to your exit vector, magnifying what could be considered the pseudo-velocity of your..."

She stopped; during her explanation, Harry had spontaneously decided to re-enact Professor Binns' last class; that is to say, he was asleep, dozed off, in a stupor, catatonic...

Hermione huffed, "Fine. It's a spell that makes the next spell you cast, stronger."

Instantly, Harry returned to wakefulness, "And you think this could help me overcome the dragons?"

Hermione nodded, "I think so, yes."

Harry just looked at her gratefully, before taking the book and flipping it open to the bookmarked page.

"/Crescendum/..." he said slowly, twirling his wand in the simple circle that the page showed, before he looked up at Hermione, "I don't feel anything."

She just shrugged, "Well, you said the Patronus Charm didn't do anything the first time you tried to cast it, right? Keep trying, you'll get it eventually."

Harry nodded, before he turned back to the book, voicing the incantation and waving his wand over and over, "Crescendum...Crescendum...Crescendum..."

*Meanwhile, in the Entrance Hall...*

"So yes, that is why nobody ever falls off the stairs, or has worse than a slight bruise during Quidditch," Professor Flitwick was explaining to a student in between lessons, "Hogwarts has wards, or auras, depending on what you want to call them, responsible for filling all our students with good luck, injury prevention and restoring their energy after classes. We're fortunate in particular to have the luck field, it was apparently extremely expensive to implement but I'm sure it prevented a terrible disaster during the basilisk incident 2 years ago."

"But sir," the student interjected, "Looking at these field designs, couldn't an intruder deliberately exploit the magic-recharge properties of the wards to invert its properties and drain magic out of the students and teachers? Empowering themselves to boot?"

Flitwick waggled a finger, "That was a risk, but the recharge aura comes with an intent ward; nobody planning harm to others, or aiming to take more than their fair share, would be able to take more than a smattering from the wards."

The student nodded, "That just leaves the possibility of someone doing so by complete accident."

"And what are the chances of that?" Flitwick laughed.

All of the lights in the castle suddenly chose that moment to fizzle out, along with all of the paintings (frustrating a lot of students trying to find their way), all of the wands (frustrating a lot of students trying to practice spells), and outside the walls, a number of broomsticks (thankfully nobody was hurt badly).

"Bugger." Flitwick muttered.

*Back at the library...*

"Hey, Hermione! I got it!" Harry whispered loudly; all of the lights had gone out, but the Boy-Who-Lived was still very visible...in fact, he was quite literally glowing with power.

"That's great..." Hermione managed tiredly, before she waved her hand, "Budge over here, my /Lumos/ isn't working."

Harry obediently scooched over to Hermione with the open book in hand; leaning over and shifting to use the shiny Harry as a nightlight, Hermione read over the page carefully, before her eyes were drawn to a warning at the bottom that she, uncharacteristically, hadn't noticed before.

"Harry..." she began before yawning loudly, "This says, 'Caution, this spell stacks with itself and is very easy to cast by accident, effects are subtle and not noticeable until next spell is cast; when practising, do NOT attempt to cast the spell multiple times in a row.'"

"Not noticeable, it says." the brightly-glowing Harry interjected with a smirk.

Hermione just looked at him (and then winced, because doing so was somewhat like looking into a lit light-bulb), before turning her attention back to the page, "'Side effects will include the inevitable exhaustion and possible long-term damage to your magic, unless you are in an area with a recharge ward in place (and what are the chances of that) whereupon you will exhaust it and drain the magic of everyone in a wide radius around you, expanding your thaumic field to maximum size, supercharging your recovery rate and turning you into a living god.' How did they even test that?" she whispered.

Harry shrugged, glancing again at the 'living god' section of the page before smiling widely.

"Harry Potter, don't you dare do anything!" Hermione hissed, seeing his expression, "You are overcharged with magical energy right now that could do absolutely anything and everything and-"

FWOOOPH!!

A few minutes later, Albus Dumbledore made his way into the library, accompanied by a brilliant red but distinctly not-on-fire un-phoenix.

"Ah, Miss Granger," he greeted cordially, "The wards have begun recovering from that shock a few minutes ago and I noticed Harry was showing unusual signs of...well, just unusual signs. Might you know where he went?"

Hermione just pointed wordlessly out the window; approaching it, Dumbledore looked down at the grounds, before he clutched at his chest, startled.

"Miss Granger, there is a dragon, the largest I have ever seen! It's obvious, the wards were brought down for such an attack-"

"Don't panic, it's just Harry. He's been turning himself into all kinds of giant monsters ever since he accidentally...the Crescendum spell, yeah." Hermione explained tiredly.

Looking confused, Dumbledore looked between her, and the large dragon out on the grounds...wait, no, now it had turned into some kind of large gorilla? A twinkle began to sparkle in the aged Headmaster's eyes as he slowly but surely realised what had happened.

Hermione noticed the twinkle, "No! No dismantling the intent ward and repeating this stunt to become all-powerful! Bad headmaster! Fawkes, tell him off!"

** Quirrel dragged Harry over to the Mirror of Erised. "What do you see, boy?" asked the man viciously.

Harry glanced at his parents before quickly coming up with an escape plan. "Um, Dumbledore. He's holding the Stone out to me, but my hands aren't free."

The low, raspy voice whispered almost straight into Harry's mind. "/Yes, yes, use the boy! The Stone will be ours!/"

The ropes fell away from Harry. As he prepared to run, the unthinkable happened. The Sorcerer's Stone actually appeared in his hand.

He stared at it. Quirrel Stared at it. Harry's mirror-parents stared at it.

Now, when questioned about his next actions, Harry would come up with all kinds of really good reasons. None of these were going through his head at the time. His thought process was as follows:

/What would Hermione do?/

/Panic and/or read something/

/That's not an option. What would Ron do, then?/

And so, Harry James Potter, Boy-Who-Lived, Gryffindor Golden Boy, shoved the Sorcerer's Stone into his mouth and swallowed it whole.

** Harry stared between the Half-Blood Prince's book and the small vial of Felix Felicis in his hand. He slowly turned to Hermione.

"Hermione?" he asked slowly.

"What?" she replied huffily.

"How hard is it to make Felix Felicis?"

She sighed. "Harry, the potion is infamous for going wrong at literally every stage. There's no way /you/ of all people could brew it."

Harry simply smirked. "Not even with a little help from Felix himself?" he asked mischievously.

Hermione turned and stared at him, gaping, before shaking her head. "There's /no way/ that's how it works."

"Only one way to find out." Harry wiggled the vial helpfully.

*[LINE BREAK]*

Hermione stared at the ten-gallon vat of golden potion in disbelief. Harry leaned against the wall smugly.

"This is insanity, Harry. Pure, utter insanity."

Harry laughed and threw an arm around her shoulder. "Seems to me like a fair exchange. Sanity, for infinite luck?"

Hermione nodded mutely. Harry grabbed a cup, dipped it in the cauldron, and took a deep swig.

"Well, I have the sudden urge to break into Gringotts today. Wanna come?"
