Hagrid's not completely human and Dobby isn't human at all. Are they capable of becoming werewolves?


** At least according to Fantastic Beasts, Muggles can be werewolves so it doesn't seem to be far off that others can be too. But then again Hagrid is a half giant and giants & house elves are a different species.

** If a werewolf bit a giant would the giant transform into a giant werewolf?

** Wouldn't Dobby be an aelfwolf instead of a werewolf?

** Giants are magically resistant, IIRC, so I would imagine a magical curse wouldn't really take hold in Hagrid properly.

No idea about Dobby. I'd say probably not, personally, but I have no particular reasoning why. :D

*** Ah, magical resistance. Great idea there.

** I doubt it would take on Dobby, being a house-elf. Hagrid is half, however, so he might be affected. But I could see it only affect him like it did Bill, even if he was bitten on the full moon. Either that, or he wouldn't survive the transformation.

** I get the sense that they wouldn't. Not just because their biology is different, but also because werewolves might not even feel compelled to attack a non-human or part-human entity. Sort of like how they tend to avoid attacking animals indiscriminately, which makes animagi safe around them.
