:END:
Looking for some good Ron Weasley fan fiction. Something in which he's in Slytherin, or at least something in which he uses his chess ability. would prefer it if he didn't make friends with Harry straight away, but instead encountered him once in a while, and was like "Oh, nice guy". Something bringing him and Harry together around 4th Year would be good. Oh, maybe Hermione is also a Slytherin; I'm a huge Romione fan. On the other hand, I also love Slytherin Ron! x Daphne. Seeing his brothers react would be interesting too. Basically just a Tactician!Poltical!Ron.

â€‹

Note: I've decided I'm going to write this fic. I found NO Ron fics!


** Fate, by TheTrueSpartan is pretty good. It's a WIP, but it's get updated almost weekly.

#+begin_quote
  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.

  Among the assets left behind by the Death Eaters, Harry Potter learns that he now owns the Chudley Cannons. And they need help getting back up and running after the war. Fortunately, Harry knows just the wizard for the job. What do you get when you mix Arithmancy and Quidditch? Hopefully, wins. (Post-War One-shot)

  When Ron Weasley realized he was reborn to the world with his memories mostly intact, he felt it was a second chance to do better. However, he slowly realizes that this world was different from his own. Making new friends and earning new enemies, he has to use his experience from his previous life not only to reach his goals, but also to survive. AU

** linkffn(Fate by TheTrueSpartan) is exactly what you are looking for!

2 million words and 100 chapters and it's still a WIP, Rin is basically a mini politician and he helps his family the Slytherin way by changing the future, and is also a chess prodigy.

It's a no brainer lol! (PLEASE HELP ME!)

** Ok, so. Here's the deal, you guys. Listen, you guys. No seriously, listen! BASICALLY. This is what's up, you guys. OK, I'm going to stop now, but that WAS funny.

I found a pretty good Ron fic, recent too. It def needs to be longer and they use and too much, but its got an interesting premise. I would personally rate it a 6/10 for execution and 8/10 for plot. Here: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13471827/1/THE-CHESSMASTER-Mummy-s-Gone-Crazy]]

It's pretty good.

AND on a different not, I'm in dire need of a beta for a new story... HELPP

*** Yeah, Ron/Daphne was definitely the weakest link in Fate. I hated that part of the story. Also, Ron is SO powerful, it's annoying. I think his character just got a little warped in the process of development. I LOVE the Chessmaster series, but it hasn't been updated in a while...

** Have read The Red Knight, The Chessmaster Series and I read Fate like a couple of months ago, but thought it was abandoned- will retry. The Granger principle and How Ron Weasley Saved the Chudley Cannons sound interesting. I do especially hope the author of Mummy's Gone Crazy continues. It's got an interesting premise, though it needs A LOT of improvement. Thx everyone.

** Always on the lookout for good Ron fic, simply because I'm so damn tired of Ron!Bashing, moreso than others.\\
I found Ron/Daphne interesting when I read a bit of Red Dragon (i think?), will have to get back into that and find more of those.\\
Another one I was reminded of is an ensemble piece, but its highly political with a Slytherin Ron (actually, all three of them are Slytherin), and as time goes on, Ron'll have some hefty House/Wizengamot responsibilities (do we have spoiler tags? i can never remember).
