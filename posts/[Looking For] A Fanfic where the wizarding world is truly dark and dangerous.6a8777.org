Hi everyone. Do you have a fic which depict the wizarding world as it should be (i.e utterly fucked up) ?

I mean, think about it for a second. Every child is given at age eleven a LETHAL weapon. Every. Child. And wands are not only lethal, but also allow to manipulate minds, erase memories and implant fake memories. Magic Rape Potion are sold in joke shops and are perfectly legal. Magic allows wizards and witches to impersonate just about anybody they want to. In a world like that, every one would be completely paranoid, and for good reasons.

Also, think about pureblood bigotry towards muggle-borns, with said muggle-borns being stuck as second class citizens, but also stuck in the wizarding world due to seven year of isolation and brainwashing. I would be surprised if there wasn't a huge civil war, with one or several muggle born dark lords seeking for revenge.

And what about Death Eaters ? Wizards, espacially inbred ones, are not very bright I'll admit, but even them would be able to realise that with a few well placed Imperius high in the muggle chain of command, the muggle world would burn without them lifting a finger.

And I won't even talk about possible super powerful magical drugs, and the strange sexual habits that such a world would bring. (Harry Potter Polyjuice would sell for quite a fortune ... as well a Dumblejuice).

Anyway, give me this crazy and fucked up world please :)

Which requires certain knowledge and skill. Most of the adult wizards can't even make a proper shield and that's a part of Hogwarts curriculum. And you are talking like eleven years old kids would be able to throw around magic beyond it.

That's not true though. People were shocked at using the word "mudblood", muggleborn was a Minister and pureblood purists were a minority that was quickly losing it footing, which is why they supported Voldemort. See for example: "Eugenia Jenkins 1968 - 1975 Jenkins dealt competently with pure-blood riots during Squib Rights marches in the late sixties" from Pottermore: Ministers for Magic.

Dark Lord is a made up Voldemort's title because he had a big ego and not some universal description for dangerous dark wizards.

Neither are muggles in Potterverse.

#+end_quote

It's good that wizarding governments heavily infiltrated the muggle ones then as shown in HBP. Also, Voldemort clearly doesn't want to break ISoS and that would risk it.

But you want fucked up magical world? You get fucked up magical world.

  Hard times lead to hard choices. What's more important? Freedom, or fate? Love, or death? Harry Potter stands on the edge of a precipice, and he is not sure if the right move is to turn and fight, or fall.

  They had a plan, formulated from before they were even born. That plan died. From its ashes rises a Harry Potter no longer willing, or able, to let others fight his battles for him. Outgunned, outclassed, outmatched, nonetheless Harry will take up the sword to change not only Britain, but the world.

** I don't have the link on me but there is an interesting cross over with hunger games where hermione gets recruited as a first year to protect the other students from the part of magic that isn't fun and cool and exciting. Where Hogwarts is more of a magic castle from old Fae mythology and things go bump in the night.
