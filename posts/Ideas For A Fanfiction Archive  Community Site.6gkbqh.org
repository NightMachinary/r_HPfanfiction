** A "[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4x5shp/public_beta_useful_feature_id_like_to_see_on/][public beta]]" type of feature where any reader can submit suggestions/fixes to the story.

** Fanfiction.net would be perfect for me if you could sort out slash fics. If I want a fic where Malfoy and Harry are friends, I'm going to ask here, because fanfiction.net will give me 99% of slash stories. Other things would be interface design; maybe readers could suggest fixing grammar mistakes by highlighting text and only author could see this? Nothing else comes to mind right now. Only that archiveofourown is not what it should look like.

So... You're talking some place where we can link to fics that are hosted elsewhere, maybe with like...a wiki-type section where we review the fics that are linked?

I mean, if you're not trying to actually host the fics themselves, I feel like you could probably use a wiki or an FAQ and just repurpose it slightly. That would also pretty easily take care of having multiple editors.

That said, I might be way off the mark fit what you are thinking. But, if this ever gets into the planning stage, I'd be interested in helping out. I also have a decent grasp of web dev, and I very much learn by doing.

**** A way to discuss the story, rather than merely commenting, could be interesting. Maybe some kind of forum (one per fic, for example), directly linked from the fic, or something like that.

Well, it's just an idea, I don't know how something like that would turn out.

Or simply the comments apparent and indented under each chapter, as in a blog.
