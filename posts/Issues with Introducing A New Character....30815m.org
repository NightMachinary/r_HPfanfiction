Specifically in my case the relatively unknown character Kevin Entwhistle as my main character. I've found that trying to find a suitable way to introduce him as a solid and believable character in a plot that begins around 5th year, at least without spending too many chapters prattling on and on about his past etc. is annoyingly hard. Has anyone else experienced issues of a similar sort? Whether you have or haven't, how did/would you deal with this problem?


** If you want to bring focus to a minor character that will become prominent, start with a reason to talk to them. Kevin isn't part of the DA that I recall, but that might be just a matter of oversight. Maybe Hermione mentions the plans in Arithmancy and the geeky Ravenclaw logics out that learning is better than not learning.

It should be done as naturally as you can- the backstory and history shouldn't even be brought up unless the character is proud of it or if the truth is important enough to bear mentioning. It also might be prudent to figure out why he wasn't prominent in canon if his unknown background was always there but never explored.

*** Sorry, I should have been more specific in my phrasing there: I mean Kevin is my planned main character. I have considered refocusing so that Kevin is only a side character, so what you say is certainly helpful regardless.

People seem to be so tentative to explore fics that involve OC's as either its main character or even as a significant supporting character. Exceptions are of course the Alexandra Quick series alongside a few other notable fics. So I guess another concern is how to move past the stigma surrounding major OC characters.

** Hello, I love writing about minor characters so I might be able to help a little.

I find the best way is to jump into the main plot and as you develop that, add little things about the main character to flesh them out as you go along. That way it's not an entire chapter of info-dumping about the new main character.

I'm writing a story that uses Michael Corner, Terry Boot and Anthony Goldstein as the mains. So the first chapter (not the prologue) is about them on the Hogwarts Express through the Welcome Feast.

So you get some of the basics as if you, the reader, were just meeting them for the first time. You know what they look like, some minor things about their personalities or family background. You should be able to tell some of the group dynamics by their interactions with each other.

Also, make the information that you're giving about them relevant to the plot or to what they're currently doing.

In the second chapter, Michael thinks about his NEWT courses when he gets his schedule, so you get insight into what he's good at and what he wants to do after school.

When Christmas time comes, I plan on introducing his family more and you get to see what environment he grew up in.

I think of it like meeting people in real life. The longer you know them, the more you learn about them. You don't get their entire biography the first time you meet them. (Although I have met people who would do that... but that's exhausting!)

** Although I have never written an FF, I find that in most of the cases where I enjoyed it the most with OC or relatively unknown characters is when the author just jump right in. I guess it depends on how complex your character's back story is and how much you need to reveal as a start. I personally like also when you don't know everything about the character at the start sometimes, flashbacks in later chapters can be useful if he has key moments in his life that changed him. Also as a reader I understand and expect that at the start of the story you introduce the characters and the set the scene, so it wouldn't seem unrealistic or annoying if you ramble a bit about his past.

Also I find that believable characters don't usually need too much description, we can relate to the character and thus inherently understand him.

Probably the easiest way to introduce the character and bring in background a bit is just have him reflect. Again I have no ideas where you story is going or how you want to portray the character, but you could always just start off with him on the Express at the start of 5th year reflecting to back how he is always been a bit of an outsider and no friends really or something and have his decide he wants to change in some way. Personally I find it very believable that a person at the start of new school year, or new anything, reflects back on their past and what they could improve.
