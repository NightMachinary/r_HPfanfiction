"It's not that quaint," The man said quickly, shaking his head. "I mean, you don't even have electricity in *their*. I don't even want to know how you keep your food cold."

"I order out a lot," Harry admitted. He frowned, his brows furrowing as he stared at the man in front of him. "What's the problem, Adam? You seem...jumpy."

"I can't keep you here anymore," The man said abruptly. "I just landed this new deal with the council and it's technically illegal to have you here. If they find out that I helped you forge the paperwork to this place, I could *loose* the deal. I think....I think you should move out."

Harry blinked, surprise and dismay showing on his face. He let his emerald eyes glisten as he stared at Adam with total shock and betrayal, who glanced away, a guilty look on his face.

"Y-You're joking, right?" Harry said slowly, his bottom lip trembling. "*Your* kicking me out?"

Seriously? How does this happen?

He has an everyday sort of face. ( = ordinary, common)

The way you say them is a bit different - for 'every day' the words are generally separated clearly with a pause, but 'everyday' runs together as a single word - so unlike with homophones like 'flour' and 'flower', misplaced everydays always jar me a lot when I read them because it actually sounds wrong in my head.
