I've tried FFNs beta search function, and maybe I'm just an idiot, but I haven't been able to find anyone willing to do anything on there. I've tried putting requests in my Author's Notes, but no takers. I've been having major writers block but don't want to abandon the story (because I hate it when that happens). I think a beta would really help. I'm new at this, so any suggestions for help are welcome.


** Here. I've found people on this sub are very willing to help provided you have basic grammar and a sensible plot.

*** What kind of help have you gotten from people? As in, what does beta-ing typically entail?

**** It really depends on your needs. Personally I'm pretty close with the Discord crowd and a few of them read my current fic anyway, so I often ask them to read through a chapter before I upload it. I do the same for them, of course.

You can have more formal arrangements too which is useful if you need deeper help than proof reading and sense checking - you usually just have one person here and you would use Google docs or track changes on word. Obviously extremely helpful but a bit more difficult to find because it's a time commitment for the other person. I have done this a lot in the past but it wouldn't be fair for me to promise that to anyone now because I just wouldn't be quick or reliable enough. I'm usually happy to look over one shots or do short term beta work, especially looking out for grammar issues and Brit picking.

Sometimes if it's one particular passage/extract you can just post it here and eveyone will chip in. I wpuldnt do that for mpre than 1000 words though.

**** It depends on what the author wants. Some want help with the plot (ie search for holes and inconsistencies or how to fill out the middle), some want a spelling/grammar check since they are not native speakers or aren't using British English on a regular basis. And some just want someone to talk their ideas through with, bounce things back and forth.

** Definitely use fanfiction.net's beta list.

Personally I just read their beta profiles, and generally the ones which are more in depth (and obviously align with your story) are the ones most likely to respond.

** I've had most luck on Facebook. I recommend trying these groups:

- Harry Potter Fanfiction
- Quills & Parchment
- Beyond the Book FanFiction Nook

These groups have very active communities with hundreds of helpful people.

** I have beta'd for people and they usually get bored with writing or don't like my suggestions and outright ignore them leaving the misspelling/grammer errors in their stories or just stop sending me their chapters, so it is just as frustrating for betas to find consistant authors. B

ut one thing that helped me the most in writing my own fics and betaing is a read-out-loud program. A lot of times it helps you hear what your eyes skip over.

** In addition to what Flo said about finding people here, when Pony has some free time there should be a section about people who are up to beta stories added onto the wiki.
