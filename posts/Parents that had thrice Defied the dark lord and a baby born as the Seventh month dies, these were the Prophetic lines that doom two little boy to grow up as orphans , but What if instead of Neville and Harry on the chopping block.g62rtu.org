What would the Malfoy's have done if there lord wanted to murder their precious baby boy. What would Bellatrix have done to protect her nephew Before Azkaban drove her completely mad, the Black were known for A love of the dark arts and A deep loyalty to family. What would've happened if a black had to choose between A nephew she loved At first sight, A sister she has always protected, and a dark lord She suspected had just murdered her baby cousin who is more like a brother. What would've happened if Voldemort's most trusted Not only Defected But went on the offensive to protect a little boy they all loved. What would Lucius Malfoy do to keep his heir alive?

IMO, Bellatrix's loyalty to the dark lord is stronger than any love she may have held for draco. Thats just my opinion though.

*** Plus she didn't seem to have any qualms about killing other family members. She would have to be massively OOC.

***** We do see evidence though. She was so loyal, Voldemort gave her a horcrux. She was so loyal she went to Azkaban for torturing people for Voldemort's location instead of lying like Lucius Malfoy did.

** The Malfoys would need to have the spine to defy Voldemort three times in such a way that Voldemort (and others) actually knew he'd been defied, and lived to tell the tale. And that is /before/ their son is threatened. Only then would Voldemort think about targeting the Malfoys.

The story would have to be at least slightly AU in a way that Lucius was never a Death Eater; just a regular pureblood snob.
