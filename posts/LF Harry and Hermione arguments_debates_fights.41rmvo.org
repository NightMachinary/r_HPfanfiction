Hey guys,

This time I am looking for arguments between Harry and Hermione (the longer the better - note: Oneshots without much plot are fine, but I prefer longer stories) - it can be anything like say the Firebolt thing (Hermione trying to protect Harry from himself and even doing it in a very underhand way and behind his back) or Hermione asking Harry's opinion on something (like obliviating her parents) etc.

Bonus points if she's not right (or at least not entirely or while right she's at least morally wrong, like with the Firebolt - sure Harry should have had it checked, but she should not have snitched to the teachers like she did either!) and if it ends up a Harry/Hermione ship like say this WIP:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3980177/11/Will-He-Be-Happy]]

Loved the fight between the two after he finds out that she's modified his memory! (I admit I hate Luna taking her side more or less later on as she indirectly tells Harry to forgive her - forgive something which is betrayal of the highest order...I'd never do that to a friend (even if I had the power to, which I don't!), unless it's something involving life and death or if the friend asks me to do it)

It most not be Harry/Hermione - it can be any other ship (ok, only really well written Harry/Ginny as I don't like that ship and no slash either (not my cup of tea!))

Stage is yours and thanks in advance :)


** Well, this is certainly a much more interesting request.

*** Great that you approve - now get to work ;) (SCNR, but if you have any recommendations I'd love to read them!)

** Sorry, but Hermione was absolutely correct about the Firebolt. Harry is a celebrity in the magical world. *Any* gift sent to him should be checked for hexes or jinxes. No matter who sent it.

The reason Hermione went 'behind his back' was so that JKR could draw out the last line of that chapter: "I think - and Professor McGonagall agrees with me - that that broom was sent by none other than Sirius Black!". Jo will always choose adding a bit of cleverness to her own narrative over consistency in her character's traits.

*** Harry did not once receive any sort of fan mail in 16+ years, nor did he ever receive anything harmful.

**** Kind of curious/suspicious (has Rowling ever commented on that?) don't you think? It's something often used in fanfiction (for the very real reason that it's highly unlikely that he wouldn't have gotten any fan-mail...I mean Shesley (Ginny Weasley) would have written to him, I am sure of it, not to mention a whole lot of other young witches - not to mentione people who lived through the war and were thankful that it was over (after all they were losing - Dumbledore was/is too forgiving to fight a war and the Ministry is damned ineffective and has more leaks than a sieve, just like the freaking order of the cooked bird, not to mention that most members aren't worth shit in a fight IMHO - and therefore GLAD that they didn't have to see Voldemort taking over!))

*** I am not saying she was not, but on the other hand going behind someone's back (particularly someone who's not many people he can really trust - I mean Harry is an emotionally stunted and damaged being and he has no sense of self-worth IMHO (he doesn't even really plan for a future because he thinks he's on borrowed time and doesn't have one!) It's why he had no problem sacrificing himself in the end (for a lot of people who don't deserve it - I'd go so far as to say none of them deserve it, not even Hermione or Neville etc.) when most people would probably say something like: "Fuck the wizard world! They don't deserve me fighting and dying for them them - sent to hatefull muggles one day, made a celebrity another and villyfied whenever someone needs a scapegoat? Fuck this shit, I am leaving!" (not to mention that most people didn't stand up for themselves, despite all of them being armed (a wand is a lethal weapon after all!) - it's one thing not to fight for yourself when you don't have access to arms, but when everybody has a "gun"? -.-)) is shitty and a betrayal of the friendship they share (she should have worked hard on convincing him - but if he'd insist on trying the broom, then it's not her fault!)

ps: Funny how the supposed celebrity never received any gifts from fans and admirers all his life? It's highly unlikely that a people who were setting off fireworks in celebration of the war ending (despite that meaning that muggles might notice them!) would not send at least letters/thank you notes and gifts to Harry!
