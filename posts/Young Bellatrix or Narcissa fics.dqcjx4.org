Hey! I'm looking for recommendations for good fics that have young Bellatrix and/or young Narcissa. They can be paired with anyone, or not paired, I don't really care. Preferably could they be likeable characters, so like before they started following Voldemort maybe? Thanks! :)


** Linkffn(A Keen Observer) is centred around Andromeda, but does explore the personalities and bonds between all three sisters. It's written as a retrospective from Andromeda's point of view, and makes use of both Andy's bond with her sisters and her hindsight to explore their characters in a very complex and well-written way!

  Andromeda says little, but she sees everything. Through their years at Hogwarts, she watches her sisters as one falls in love and one falls into madness, and doesn't see as a muggleborn boy breaks into her sheltered life. Now Complete.

*** Oh my gosh!! I can't wait. You've totally opened a can of worms. I'd love Bellatrix playing some (most likely mean-spirited but still funny) pranks on other family members? narcissa and andromeda having a good relationship before she gets burnt off of the family tree? scenes in Grimmauld? Hogwarts pranks? Gryffindor rivalries (Arthur Weasley?)? Narcissa and Lucius? Maybe one of them as a prefect who totally abuses their power? That uncle Alphard that Sirius loved? Kreacher apparating into Hogwarts to help with their schemes? Honestly I'd be happy reading anything!

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.
