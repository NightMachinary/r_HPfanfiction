I just finished reading Grey Space by noaacat---which I got from a recommendation on this subreddit, and would also /highly recommend/. I loved how Privet Drive was described so vividly, and I could totally imagine the middle class sensibilities that shaped the characters' actions.

So I'm wondering if there are other fics that incorporate muggle settings in a strong way---either as a primary or secondary element. I'm looking for Tom Riddle and the Blitz/WWII, Snape kicking it in working class Cokeworth in the 70s and 80s, Harry dealing with hellscape suburbia Privet Drive in the 90s.

I think it's kind of hilarious to request the not-magic part of Harry Potter in fanfics, and there are probably plenty of books set in these times that I could find - but this always ends up being a favorite aspect of mine when I'm reading HP stories, so I thought I'd seek out additional recommendations. Thanks!

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

** I'm sort of writing one. How strong the Muggle elements are is up to you.

  By all rights, the story of Holly Potter and Alex Kann should have ended when they parted ways at age 11. Their destinies lay in different worlds: witch and Muggle; magic and science; Scotland and London. Then Alex came up with the idea of selling potions to Muggles. Their waning bond is revived, but can it last while running a nascent illegal business, the challenges of school and new relationships? Time-shifted AU, Pre-Hogwarts, Years 2-4

** I've been looking for this as well, specifically fics that incorporate the time period and social class into the Muggle side of things.
