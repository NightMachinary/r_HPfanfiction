  The Sorting Hat serves more purposes than is apparent. One of them is as a safe guard against abusive families. What changes might be wrought from this? Rated for coarse language and mild violence.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

** linkffn(Harry's New Home) is pretty good. It also has the advantage of making the kids act like kids! So many fics make the 11 year olds act like small 38 year olds that finding one without this flaw is refreshing.

  One lonely little boy. One snarky, grumpy git. When the safety of one was entrusted to the other, everyone knew this was not going to turn out well... Or was it? AU, sequel to "Harry's First Detention". OVER FIVE MILLION HITS!

*** That's one of the worst fics I have ever had the displeasure of reading. The author knows nothing about how children who are abused behave, and the story is absurd. I'm a fan of the Snape rescues Harry genre and there are far better fics.

**** interesting, somewhat unique, yes clichés but they work well. frequent updates, situations where you really really want to see some ass kicked (they will get theirs) and overall one of the stories in the last several years I actually look forward to. If you start to read it you might find yourself up 18 hours later still reading.
