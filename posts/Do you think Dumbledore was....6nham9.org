old enough to participate in the last triwizard tournament before it was banned?


** u/Notosk:
#+begin_quote
  The Tournament was renowned for being extremely dangerous: champions have died while competing and *was discontinued after 1792*, due to the high death toll.

** I thought that was around 1780 or so? (Earlier?) Which would make Dumbledore over 200 years old, so probably not (unless Flamel gave him some of his anti-aging/immortality juice)...I mean Dumbledore was younger Griselda Marchbanks (right?) and even she wasn't that old!

Ok, checked it: He was older, but still not old enough, not by far :D ^{^}

Still, I'd read a fanfiction with that in it (but it would probably need to have a Dumbledore who's AGAINST the Tournament, not like in canon where he helped organize it and helped to pressure Harry into competing (I mean worst case if he really had to: Why not forfeit all of the tasks? Participation is mandatory if your name comes out, making an effort probably is NOT!), because he probably only would have barely survived it himself!)
