:END:
Read this just recently but can't find it in my history / remember the name, so hopefully someone can help me find it.

​

Basically, Harry at about age 18-20+ jumps dimensions from shit-went-bad war-torn world, arrives in a world where there's still a Dark Lord and Blood supremacist terrorists, but they aren't Voldemort / Death Eaters.

Tom Riddle was raised by the Carrows, became Lord Slytherin (and is semi-respectable / not a blood supremacist afaik), had a son who married Bellatrix (who is semi-sane), and also has a Granddaughter.

The Potters are still alive, alt-Harry got killed by alt dark lord, Neville is BWL.

Harry upon arriving, saves Toms Grand-daughter from a kidnap attempt, but obliviates her, gets a secret base, starts hunting terrorists, then later saves Neville and co at Department of Mysteries and duels the alt-dark lord.

Last chapter I read had Potters/Sirius/Dumbledore/Tom discovering grand-daughter had been obliviated, working together trying to figure out who Harry was and coming up with the theory of Dimension Travel.

I recently found a story I had read like 7 years ago, because I typed in something I remembered + ffnet, and boom, it was the third result.

***** Yeah, thought the fic was older than that myself. It's definitely worth a read - has a semi-unique premise and decent story so far, relatively well written, but could do with an editing pass to fix some minor spelling/grammar errors.

****** I don't understand how the author has managed to mix up their/there and than/then so many times but also get it right so many times. It's so inconsistent that it doesn't make sense to me.

  Harry sacrificed everything to kill the Dark Lord. He sacrificed more to kill the next one. And the next. And the next. By the end, he had nothing left to give, and nothing left to win. Burdened by failure, he's thrown into a new world with familiar faces and unfamiliar personalities, and must fight to survive. AU, Dimension Travel, Graphic Violence.
