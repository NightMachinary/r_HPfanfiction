So, who remembers a certain Disney cartoon? The one with the guinea pigs multiplying like tribbles and the irish jig about the bureaucracy that makes tons of paperwork dealing with the problem?

Right. Now, for those of you who know it, how would you feel about a Harry Potter fanfic where Umbridge has a few explosively breeding puffskeins confiscated from students, and subsequently gets the Ministry embroiled in paperwork when she tries to find a way to stop more puffskeins popping up everywhere?

Or, you know, something like that. I just want tribble-equivalents, bureaucracy, and irish jigs in Harry Potter.
