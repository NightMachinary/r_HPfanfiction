so years ago I read this fic where Harry gets hit with a curse that strips him of the ability to use wizarding magic. However, he does learn to use a different kind of magic thats older and more primal than what wizards use. In the story, wizards fear and hate this old magic and all found practitioners are blinded and put in prison for life. If anyone could help me I'd really appreciate it.


** And the winner is: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Third Key: Reloaded by slowfox) !!!
