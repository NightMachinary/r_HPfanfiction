...is because some pure blood didn't want “filthy muggle technology” mucking around in the magical world, so they used the Fidellius Charm to hide the idea that electricity works just fine around magic, and pass that knowledge down to their heir to maintain the secret.

That's why, despite evidence to the contrary (Diagon Alley and the Ministry being smack in the middle of London) no one can use that evidence to come to the correct conclusion. Even if they test it, and it WORKS, they are unable to process and retain that information.

Thoughts/alternative explanations?


** If memory serves, I think in the Dresden universe, magic mostly doesn't mix well with technology simply because people expect it not to. I've always been amused by that idea.

*** My take is similar: Most magicals neither understand, like, respect, nor believe in Muggle technology, particularly electricity. Magic is driven by intent, emotion, will, and belief. So many practitioners of magic being so hostile to technology and its workability colors the magic they emit, such that when large amounts of said magic are present the magic tries to alter reality to conform to this prejudice.

**** That would explain why the area surrounding Diagon and St Mungos isn't an electricity dead zone. The Wizards don't consider themselves as part of the Muggle world, so the effect doesn't stretch outside of magical territory.

Would also give a Muggle method of getting around unplottable and other such protections. Just give a kid a phone with Pokemon Go and tell them to walk forward until shit stops working. Do that in enough spots and you can get a full radius of the affected area.

***** In the Warhammer universe, there is a race called "Orkz". They are a genetically engineered race made out of fungi that live only for war. The thing about them Is that they have amazingly powerful psychic abilities, but they don't know that.

So if they, for example, paint their vehicles red, those vehicles will move faster, because "DA RED WUNZ GO FASTA!"

*** Not quite. Under Dresden principles magic marks the humans who use it as being "different" from normal people. In ye olden tymes that meant warts and spoiled milk and two-headed calves, in the modern day it means computers vomiting.

** I don't like the Fidelius being used that way for "ideas/facts". The Hogwarts Book and Quil (the book that writes down magic born people? Yeah, you can fidelius that. The Ministry records repartment? All of that is hard data.

I think they ward Hogwarts to prevent use of electronics. Seven years of being in there would wring out any common sense you have left to prevent questioning of things. And those people that keep the common sense most likely leave the magical world (or at least magical britain).

*** I think that as an application of magic, the fidelius works to hide secrets, not locations. Any secret can be hidden as long as it is in fact a secret. A hiding place that no one knows about works, a publically known fact does not.

In this case I could see it as something that this pureblood did at a point where most people hadn't had any chance to discover for themselves the truth. Then people facing the obvious facts such as diagon alley are treated the same way Voldemort would have been if he had tried to look into the window of the Potters hiding place in Godrics Hollow. They can see it but they can't realize what they are seeing.

**** It's interesting, but it borders on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9901496/1/][god-like control]].

Fidelius "Muggleborns don't steal magic." It's now a universal fact that they steal magic.

Fidelius "Voldemort doesn't have legs." It's now a universal fact that Voldemort doesn't have legs.

It's too reality warping for my tastes.

***** I prefer that the spell requires a) the secret to actually be a secret, and b) the secret to "belong" (at least to a considerable extent) to the person casting the spell. They have to trust /their/ secret to the secret-keeper.

Btw, you've got your examples reversed. If the secret was "Voldy doesn't have legs", then everyone could only see him /with/ legs, because his lack of legs is secret and hidden.

This theory would make a lot more sense if the Wizarding World had NO Muggle technology at all (the cars, radios, Knight bus, etc).

** I like this explanation quite a bit as a possible plot point in a fic, not quite headcanon territory for me though. Highly plausible though.

It kind of reminds me of an idea someone had once for a plot point where the Statute of Secrecy itself was not just a legal statute, but a massive world wide two way world confundus like spell that helped maintain the separation. Average Muggles don't think about magic unless it is so blatant they can't justify it, they don't notice the knight bus and have a hard time holding on to what it is even when they've been told, eg Vernon calling dementors dementoids right after being told about them. Conversely the same thing prevents people like Arthur from figuring out things like "ekeltricity"

** It's never stated tech doesn't work in diagon Ally, etc. Only in Hogwarts. I always figured it was something close to the arcanum of steamworks and magic obscura explanation though. Tech works within the laws of physics and magic works by overriding them, therefore areas with tons of ambient magic(not a Canon term I don't think, but it works.) make technology work in unpredictable ways. Hogwarts probably just has a lot more ambient magic than diagon alley.

*** That's a good point, I think it's in GoF that Hermione mentions it as a throwaway about how they can't use scuba gear for the second task as a result.

It could even have nothing to due with the quantity of magic, rather it could be a deliberate effect cast by one of the former headmasters or something similar.

There's a looot of room for the “why” things work the way they do in canon, hence all the contradictory views in the fandom.
