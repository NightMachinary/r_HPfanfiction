** Baffled. Is there some on-going campaign to force Jbern to write fanfic again? It's like everyday a Jbern thread... Bruh

*** Well, a sequel to TLIL would give some closure.

But I think it be a troll.

**** I hear that, tho. Unfortunately, I reckon there's as much chance of a(nother) follow-up to /The Skitterleap/ being posted. :/

****** I've, er... heard rumours, I guess? Either way, there's no traceable record of one on the Internet, so it'll have to remain as one of many of Fan-fiction's Unsolved Mysteries... /~fades to black/

***** To Jbern's credit, I'm 99.99'% sure that he's got nothing to do with any of this. It's either a crazed fan, the same troll(s) plagiarising DLP authors or both.
