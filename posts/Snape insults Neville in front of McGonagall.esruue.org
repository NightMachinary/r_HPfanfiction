I'm curious what she'd do, particularly if this happened right when the lesson is about to start. She knows Neville lacks confidence, but doesn't address this issue. Would she do something if Snape insulted Neville right before her lesson?


** My money on nothing. We don't see her acting as a competent Head of the House even once.

Snape isn't at all subtle in his attitude, she knows how he is.

*** Sadly this

But she is seriously overworked as well, if you at the books, she is like a teacher for a important class (only teacher for it), head of house and like the secretary of Dumbledore, even if it is call vice headmistress or something. And those last two are a real conflict of interest if you ask me, because as the former she has to protect her students and the later she has to protect the teachers and when a teacher is shitty to a student then it gets tricky

**** I also agree with the "nothing" prediction, and with the idea that two of her roles are in conflict: If the role of Deputy Headmistress is anything like that of Assistant Principal was at my high school, she's the one mainly in charge of general student discipline (with only the really serious cases going to the Headmaster). To do this job properly, she'd have to act as an impartial arbiter, but a Head of House is supposed to be their charges' main advocate in all things school-related.

She obviously can't be both at once, and it seems like she's chosen to be the impartial arbiter, leaving Gryffindors with nobody to advocate for them in many cases. Worse, in some fics, she's described as trying too hard to be seen as impartial and thus is actually harsher on Gryffindors than the other houses, second only to Snape.

To be honest, though, the only /good/ Head-of-House in the books seems to be Sprout, who supports her students without actively abetting their misbehavior. Snape supports the Slytherins too far, encouraging their wrongdoing and shielding them from consequences while punishing anyone that dares stand up to them. Flitwick, head of the House known for intelligence, managed to have Luna in his House for over three years without once figuring out that she was being relentlessly and egregiously bullied.

Obviously the adults had to be useless to justify the children/teens doing all the hero-ing, but it's still galling to see so many teachers fail so utterly the students in their care.

That is always my canon explanation why none of the older Gryffindors ever encourage the trio to go to a teacher, they all saw McGonagall being useless in standing up for them against Snape for years, so why should that change now? And the trio goes to her in the first year only to be rebuffed and then they do it on their own. I mean how difficult would it have been to go with them to the 3rd floor and tell them she will check or something, even if she is convinced that it is rubbish. She arrives and sees the instrument there and knows that shit is going down...

This isn't even a fic thing, it's canon. She /is/ the harshest teacher, including towards Gryffindors. Which is why I don't understand how the fanon view of her as a "mother lion who would do anything to protect her cubs" is a thing.

In Y1, she docks Harry, Hermione and Neville 150 points for the great crime of breaking curfew, which makes them wildly unpopular with the other Gryffindors. So she single-handedly sends her own House to the bottom /and/ she makes sure Harry&co will be bullied by their own housemates. On top of that, she sends them to the Murder Forest to find the horrifying Unicorn killer. At the same time, she only docks Draco 20 points for the same crime.

For comparison, Snape deducts 2 points from Harry during the first class, and 5 from Ron for attacking Draco, and McGonagall docks 5 points from Hermione for going after a troll, and awards Harry and Ron 5 points each for saving Hermione.

In PoA, she takes all of Neville's privileges away and locks him out of the Common Room, with a killer on the loose, forcing him to humiliate himself in front of the other Gryffindors. All for the great crime of... losing a piece of paper, which he actually didn't do, Crookshanks stole it for Sirius; McG didn't know that, but she could have at least suspected that maybe someone had played a prank on Neville.

In OotP she docks points from Harry for losing his temper with Umbridge, despite knowing that Umbridge was unfairly punishing Harry, and that Harry had just went through an extremely traumatic experience, and was being treated like trash by a lot of the students, including some Gryffindors.

Heads of Houses are supposed to be a bit like surrogate parents to these children who have just been separated from their family and their normal life. Instead, McGonagall treats them like a prison warden and even endangers their life.

****** This is why I like fanfiction. There are seeds of who the adult characters can be, but in canon their actions are not the actions of people I would want to be friends with. Fanfiction allows people like Mcgonagall, Dumbledore, Lupin, and Sirius to do the things that justify the way we feel about them as readers

******* Oh, sure, I can absolutely understand that! There's nothing wrong with preferring the fanon version of a character or plot. The problem is when people try to dismiss canon because it explicitly contradicts their headcanons, which is how we end up with people aggressively pushing ideas like "McGonagall using corporal punishments on Draco is the right thing to do, and she had Neville's best interests at heart when she locked him outside of the Common Room, with a murderer on the loose", "James and Sirius weren't bullies"/"Who /wasn't/ a bully when they were young???"/"Men can't sexually assault other men" and so on. Not only does this ruin the themes of the books, it usually has unfortunate real-life implications. All of the examples mentioned are actual replies.

Someone told me that getting into a scuffle with an 11 y.o. child and dragging him around by the ear, while yelling at him, is what "every mother should do". Verbatim.

***** I agree with your last point. I think that's why now I prefer fics where adults get involved in the horcrux hunt and so on. And I do get they have to be useless, but sometimes it feels like they just teach and then walk with their eyes closed for the rest of the day. Well, that's what I get for rereading a children's series, I guess.

****** If you lurk on [[/r/Teachers][r/Teachers]] for a while, you quickly find out that many do exactly that simply to survive. Locked doors during lunch breaks just so that neither their students nor their colleagues can interrupt their "me-time".

Their job is to teach, yet they are often asked to parent as well. Parenting teenagers is very exhausting, especially if you do it on top of a full-time job and for more children than just the 1-3 the average family has. Add in the so-called mental load and it becomes too much very fast.

My personal headcanon is that one of the teachers just about had it and sues the school for being forced to work too many hours.

There is no excuse for her behavior whatsoever in that situation. If she's overworked then she needs to straighten out her priorities. She is the adult, the children shouldn't have to suffer due to her abysmal behavior.

I am thinking of heads of house who aren't teachers, who have the time to get to know the students and who are good at handling homesickness as well as bigger problems the teenagers might have, like getting disowned and cut off from their parents' finances.

********* Yeah Rowling's had no idea how boarding school worked passed some hearsay at best. A high student to teacher ratio is 15 to 1 in a boarding school. Like super high and probably not worth the time to attend compared to better ratio schools. The ratio for a school Hogwarts size should be no more than 8 to 1.

That's ignoring the insanity of the students having magic wands. Discipline is a huge undertaking in regular boarding schools. Picture how much worse it would be with magic in the picture.

**** I'm also wondering if her inaction has to do more with the fact that she is just the sort of person who can't be bothered to encourage struggling students. I have a feeling she never had to strugle at school so it's difficult for her to understand what that's like. Though I have to admit to me it just seems logical to encourage a struggling student. She's worked there long enough to realise this at least. Maybe she doesn't care all that much about those who don't get good results immediately like Hermione.

******** I nevver actually thought about how it feels to be praised by those who are more capable. And I do have to agree with you on that.I think that people's belief it was the marauders' fault Peter turned into traitor is because of that scene where Sirius, I believe, calls him stupid for not getting all signs of a werewolf. I know it's off topic, but I've been wanting to discuss this for some time. In old forums, some people said that this scene is not representative of everything that went on between them. Others say this is precisely what their relationship was like. To be honest, I really wish we had more scenes with them. But then again, they bothered to include him in the whole animagus plan and McGonagall apparently only managed to be harsh with him. If Remus as an 11-year-old saw Peter was someone who needed friends, an adult teacher should have realised he needed help. What do you think about the way their friendship was portrayed? I saw opinions that James was fine with having him because he liked people to worship him.

**** I've seen this explanation. It sounds too much like trying to justify her inaction, though. I get it's probably true, but then, why does she take on so many different duties to the point where she is unable to do her job properly? I'd love to know what she does as a deputee headmistress. She should be responsible for timetables maybe, but maybe it's easier with magic.

***** Think about what Dumbledore does and doesn't do and you can easily figure out what Minerva McGonagall gets stuck with.

Dumbledore has a bunch of offices and functions like supreme mugwump, inofficial advisor to Fudge (up to about year 2). Lots of duties that probably call him away from the school more often than not. I bet my Ravenclaw badge that while he likes the title and prestige of headmaster, he has very little time to actually do the job of headmaster.

Enter Minerva McGonagall, deputee headmistress.

A boarding school with up to 1000 students in it requires quite a bit of logistics to sort out. Just think about all the food - it needs to be ordered somewhere and somebody needs to check the quality and freshness. There are finances to sort through: Which students need a scholarship? Can we afford to buy a new blackboard after Neville Longbottom destroyed the one in the Potion's classroom? What about giving the teachers a raise?

The teachers work really shitty hours if you think about it. While it is not explicitely stated, they have a full work load as teachers and then they need to be available after classes for overseeing the students as well. Many boarding schools have dedictated staff for this, but at Hogwarts it is the teachers. I would not be surprised if the teachers effectively were on duty for 60+ hours each week, the head of houses even more so.

******* It is my personal head canon that one of the reasons Snape is so nasty is because he is extremely frustrated.

Imagine trying to sneak out of the castle on Friday night after dinner, all dressed up for a night at the clubs only to have to deal with some stupid emergency bc the little brats hexed each other, possibly with one of the first years puking all over your shoes.

If dinner is at 7, he would be out by 8 if everything goes smooth, then a walk or flight down to Hogsmeade before he can Apparate. Lets say he hits the clubs by 9. Depending up school rules, he might be required to be back by curfew, which could be around 10 or 11.

Teenagers aren't stupid, it would be noticed if he was gone for a whole night. They would quickly figure out why and it would probably draw some comments, especially from the 3rd and 4th years.

There are no fees for attending Hogwarts.

The only things students need to pay for are their supplies, so at the very most students might apply for a grant for these.
