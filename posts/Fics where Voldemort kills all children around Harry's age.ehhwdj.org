Recently I read a fic where Voldemort after hearing prophecy kills all children a year above and a year below in Harry's age. It was such a good concept, I'm wondering were there any fics like this. I wanna know how death eaters like Malfoy reacts after losing their child? Will they still supports Voldemort or help Harry in defeating him? How will Harry connects with people two years above his age? How other students treat him?

The story I read was very new and started just one day ago, so only one chapter. linkffn(13464146)

  What if when Voldemort heard the prophecy, he decided that not only would he go after Neville and Harry, but every child born in that year? What if he decided to kill all children born the year before and the year after as well, just to be on the safe side? Harry Potter is the only boy who lived through the Purge, no one knows why. How will a young Harry Potter now cope? No romance

  It was foretold that a child born at the end of July would be his downfall. Lord Voldemort didn't want to take any chances as to whom the prophecy could apply to. Malfoy POV, Complete.

Dimensiontravel where his age group was killed. Good read, but that is not really the central element in the story.

  Harry won the war. It's a couple months afterwards and unexpectedly, he's quite literally picked up off the face of the world and shoved into another. One where Harry Potter died a long time ago and the Potter family's still fighting a war with a Dark Lord whose ruling over the world one muggle murder at a time. They say he's their only hope. Harry doesn't really want in.

** Problem is many of his followers were having kids at the same time. Draco Malfoy and Theodore Nott are obvious examples. I am sure there were others too. How would his followers feel about him just killing off their precious heirs? I have a feeling they might have run off to Dumbledore for protection and provide lot of vital information for said protection. It would have been a political suicide for Voldemort.
