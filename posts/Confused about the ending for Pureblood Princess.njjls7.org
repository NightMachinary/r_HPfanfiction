I've just finished it and the epilogues but I still don't really understand it fully.


** First of all, there are several Harry Potter fics called "Pureblood Princess". I'm pretty sure this fic is the most popular linkffn(6943436), but I'd like a confirmation.

Now, if you are talking about this fic, here's what happen :

At the end of chapter 18, Daphne had somehow managed to heal the injuries on Harry thanks to the Theories developped by her mother. But this feat somehow made her lose her Magic. She also lost all her memories of the Magical World but I personally think that was due to a Memory Charm.

Anyways, some years after the story, Daphne is living in the Muggle World with no knowledge of the Magical World (even her family keep it secret from her during their rare interaction). One day, she meets a guy named Harry that seem a bit strange, but really wants to seduce her.

The whole epilogue is basically Harry rebuilding a relation with her (to acquaintance to lover, and then husband), said from Daphne point of view. The only thing that really matter is that Daphne mother's died (probably killed because her theories saved Harry's life), her sister Astoria is fianced to Theodore Nott (which she dislikes), and that Harry also kept the Magical World a secret (she doesn't really know what he does for a living, but he showed her that he was loaded).

Years later, Daphne is a researcher married to Harry. They live in 4 Square Grimmault, and they have a little girl. Right after the 10th anniversary from their daughter, Harry finally tells her the truth and gives her the private diary she had kept while at Hogwarts, so she could at least understand what happened to her. He probably told her because their daughter is now 10 (or 11?), and her Hogwarts letter is soon due.

Epilogue 05 is what happened between Chapter 18 and the 1st epilogue, said from Harry point of view. How he won the war, and what he did before (re) meeting Daphne.

*** Daphne's mom is killed by Death Eaters who wanted her to use the necromantic research to bring back Lord Voldemort. She refused.

Daphne, after losing her magic and her mother was incredibly depressed. Her father, also depressed at seeing his daughter suffering and losing his wife, agreed to erase her memories of the magical world as a coping mechanism. They create a diary that stores them that he holds for her.

Claire has a late summer birthday and is a witch. Harry tells Daphne the truth as he knows he wont be able to keep it a secret for much longer as Claire will be getting her Hogwarts letter soon.

The story ends where it does because anything after isn't going to be pleasant. Best case, divorce, worse case, suicide.

Unless the poster is talking about the last epilogue in which case it's a tale of a group of adventurers returning to one of their party's home town where the stumble into a misadventure while investigating the disappearances of some local mages.

Two of the party, Volke and Caelya, are working through a blooming relationship while knowing their decisions are likely going to estrange them from the group and struggling with leaving their friends and their adventuring life behind.

All while Torman is struggling with his jealousy of the relationship that developed between Voke and Caelya, assuming that the thief's introduction to their group is what prevented the cleric from loving him. He's looking for any way to get the thief out of the way, whether it's leading the group in circles through the desert hoping they die of thirst, or attacking when his back is turned.

All while Ragthuk is, well, compensating for something.

  Daphne Greengrass always had a plan. She liked being organized. But the Dark Lord's return at the end of her fifth year derailed everything, and now she must decide who will best help her find the life she always wanted.
