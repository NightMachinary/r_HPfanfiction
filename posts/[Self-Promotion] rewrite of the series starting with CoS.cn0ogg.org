So! I'm planning to completely rewrite the series starting with second year. It's gonna focus on friendship and fixing some just... dumb plot stuff from miss Joanne herself (if Hermione can figure out it's a basilisk with a few months research... why can't the teachers!?). It will also deal with the the Dursley's abuse and getting Harry OUT OF THERE! I've already got 30k written of it, and I'd love some feedback. Please read the tags for triggers and warnings!

(I've also never posted here before, so please tell me if I've done anything incorrectly!)


** +It's only the second sentence, but the Ministry sent the letter that informed the Dursleys that Harry wasn't able to perform magic, not Hogwarts.+

Edit: I realized that the fic didn't start shortly after Dobby visited Harry, as it initially seemed. My apologies.
