I just started watching High School Dxd and now I'm looking for some crossovers with HP. Does anyone know of some well written ones?

Preferably het fics.

Thanks

This is definitely my favorite HP/DXD fic. It's sort of a crack fic, but it's well written, and kind of sweet. Unfortunately it hasn't been updated in a while.

  Kuroka had thought she would fail. Her nine lives had been used up trying to save her sister, but it had all been futile. She had resigned to simply escaping, but out of the blue, a random man claiming to be a wizard appears, wielding powers beyond anything anyone had ever seen. With his help, she may just yet be able to save her sister, altering fate. The Master of Death comes.

  Some stories start in the most average ways, and this was no exception. How would things change if a certain Devil shared a bench with a certain green-eyed wizard after a hard day of school? Rated M for safety and mature content in second part.
