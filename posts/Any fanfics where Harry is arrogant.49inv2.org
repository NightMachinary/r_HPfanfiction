Fanfics similar to say The Second Son linkffn(11009366). Every wrong boy who lived trope has Harry the protagonist as the good guy when the other twin is the epitome of arrogance and stupidity.

Are there any that switch this or just a fanfic where Harry is justifiably arrogant and a bully or just has a insanely huge ego? I'd dig that.

  A story about Harry in Slytherin house wielding the elder wand and the powers of an elemental. Features annoying Weasley's, an OFC, a flawed but good Dumbledore, an indifferent Snape and lots and lots of twists.

** Shezza's trilogy is the obvious answer, but I guess you already know of it. I will add linkffn(The fallen renegade) which is a spinoff of said trilogy. If I remember correctly, Harry is an even bigger asshole in that one.

Edit: The really good part starts from chapter 9. The earlier stuff is introductory.

**** Yep. The familiar wbwl tropes do exist on the first chapter. Seems like a deal-breaker, but as I said the interesting (and very amusing) stuff starts a couple of chapters later.

**** Really? You're one of the first people I have seen criticize Shezza like that. Remember that Shezza wrote his trilogy in 2007. Back then there was nothing like this, and while today there are numerous awful fics filled with tropes, Shezzas' just isn't one I think.

***** They're talking about The Fallen Renegade, not The Denarian Renegade. Well, I assume that because I pretty much agree with them if they are talking about The Fallen Renegade.

  He hated his life, his relatives, and most importantly, his own weakness. So when he chances upon a Denarius coin, he took it, even if it meant damning his own soul in the process. And now, he's a Denarian, the host of a Fallen Angel, and the Fallen is hungry for vengeance; and for him, absolutely nothing will stand in his way. Based on Shezza's Denarian Renegade. Slight HP/FD.

  A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.
