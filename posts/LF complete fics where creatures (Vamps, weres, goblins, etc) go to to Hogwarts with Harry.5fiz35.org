*** The only Robst story dealing with creatures besides Gringots is Harry Crow and that's not what I mean.

**** Well the story makes it very clear that Harry Crow is a goblin (in spirit), and at the end of it goblins do go to hogwarts.

That said, I get what you mean. Does Accidental Animagus work? Not spoiling anything, but several characters become wearwolves and still attend hogwarts

I do know that One World (one of the ones where the Grangers adopt Harry) has a fair few magical creatures show up at Hogwarts, including a drow who teaches bardic music.

Unfortunately, the fic is incomplete and hasn't been updated for over a year...

** I second this request and would like to further an additional request for a Hogwarts where magical creatures of all kinds (goblins, centaurs, house-elves, lycanthropy victims, giants, merpeople...sphinxes?) are allowed to attend and the wizarding world is truly multicultural and multiracial.
