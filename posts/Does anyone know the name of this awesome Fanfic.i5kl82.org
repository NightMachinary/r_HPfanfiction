:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So the premise was that Harry had a trunk full of magical creatures (ie: nifflers and a bunch of random ones, I think a Phoenix and maybe a nundu,the trunk basically like newt's (might have inherited it from him) ). Tbh I remember really liking the fic but don't remember much of the other details. I think it was pretty long as well.

Idk if anyone know what the fic was but if so that would be greatly appreciated!!!


** There's one (unfinished) where he has a trunk full of magical creatures because in the future the magic died and he time travelled with the surviving ones in stasis to try to go back far enough to save them. It's a bit angsty because not all of them made it.

He also goes to all the muggle orphanages and collects the "special" children to bring to his own orphanage, including a boy named Tom.

Sadly the author abandoned fanfic writing altogether because of too many attacks on his grammar/punctuation. It was a really good story despite these flaws.
