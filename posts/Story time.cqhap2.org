It was 1067, Thomas was on the run with his wife and child, they traveled across the ocean and then went north

Thomas feared for their safety, wizards and muggles relationships were forbidden, they started the run when Thomas noticed how large his girlfriend was over Christmas break.

He was to graduate Hogwarts that year, but he threw it all away that summer when he went to that muggle party.

He no longer felt regret when he saw his child though, except for the fact they would never see Hogwarts and be trained by such amazing wizards.

By the time the boy could walk Thomas had decided they traveled far enough, it was winter and they were on ice. Thomas had heard of a group who use entire tree trunks to fly rather then broom sticks, he didnt want to press his luck so he tried to create his own flying broom stick by carving a branch and using spells in the text book he borrowed when he went on vacation.

No stick would work though, all broke, he felt sitting on a broom would be too difficult so he carved out a trunk with magic so he could sit his legs in and carved the outside like a arrow and used his spells.

This worked, he was finally able to fly and saw they stopped near a giant lake, completely frozen right now. He improved on his flying log and carved it to look similar to a modern toboggan.

He sat with his mother and child and they flew over the lake and saw how large it was, they could fly for hours without seeing land. The man enchanted some ice to never melt and made enchantments so boats would go around.

He used his toboggan to get more wood and stone and build their home with a combination of that and ice.

By the time the boy (his name was charles) was 7 he had his own toboggan and would travel with his father to get material.

When charles was 10 he was upset he was never allowed to jouney on his own, when his parents were asleep he took his fathers wand and took his toboggan for a journey, he flew until the sun was high up in the air and found a village.

As he got close some started shooting arrows and Charles tried to fly away but not before. An arrow broke through the bottom and through Charles leg.

In too much pain to continue to much further he comes and lands a few Km away, crying not able to move his leg, the arrow sitting through it and the toboggan.

Charles tried to use the wand but realized he never learned any spells, in anger he broke his wand, immediatly regretted it though and kept both pieces with a small string attaching them

Not his but a tribes dad came with his triplets, 2 girls and a boy, they cut his toboggan in two and get his leg out.

Not speaking the same language they arent able to figure out what it is the boy wants, he grows up with the village learning to work with them and slowly speak their languages.

By the time charle is 20 he has his own home and is living with a wife, kih-arhi, one of the triplets and their twin daughters, one named after Charles mother.

Kih-arhi sees charles broken wand and gives it to Debrah, the one named after Charles mom and when she flicks it sparks fly out.

Charle not seeing magic in years jumps in joy while Kih-arhi freaks out and grabs Kah-wa the twin away.

Charle explains best he can not knowing words like magic in her language, but she looked at him with fear and he knew he had to run, he knew he and his children werent safe, the look his wife gave him said she had no trust for his kind.

Charles spends weeks looking for the lake, he avoids a few villages until he sees a house appear as he gets within 20 meters of it and slowly a village appeared

As he entered people looked out their windows and came out to see the new comer, an older man in robes comes out and explains when he sees the children and the one with the broken wand that they can not fix that but make a new one.

The man explained they were wizards hiding here, their were just over 50 of them, they came hiding from nearby villages when their powers came out, only he and his apprentice could make wands.

Charles explains about the toboggan and the man says he sees someone flying around in one all the time, they make plan to signal him down.

They set off fireworks when Thomas flies by and charles and he reunites, charles explains about his last 10 years, his father apologizes for everything and wants him to return.

When seeing the village though Thomas asks if they will join, he can make and show them how to make flying tobaggans if they will show how to make wands.

It isnt until years later they start calling themself a school, and men long after these founders decided to have houses. For these men thought their school would never be large enough to need to separate the children by houses

In 1600's the school was separated into 3 houses and these 3 are commonly and incorrectly called the founders, but their story is a story for another time

And that is the story of how Wizards of Superior (it's on lake superior) was founded

(The Canadian school because Ilvermorny is for Americans and I was bored)


** Very good, but Hogwarts didn't exist in 867.

*** Dang, I just chose a random year, wanted it to be before canada was founded and after Hogwarts was founded. Switch the year to 50 years after Hogwarts was founded, that way Thomas may have even seen 3 of the 4 founders in person, idk if Slytherin was still around or left early on

Edit: I changed the date in the story

  867 ”They just crossed the ocean”

Y'all know that until the mid-second millennium the only people from europe to ever travel to the Americas was Vikings in the 10th century, right? You don't just “cross the ocean”
