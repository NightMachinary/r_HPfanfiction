** The thing about BWL Neville is that it doesn't work. There needs to be a reason for Voldemort to spare the mother (in this case Alice) so that her refusal and her sacrifice for her son's life will trigger that Love magic. Snape convinced Voldemort to spare Lily, otherwise he would have killed her right away

*** You can always think out a reason if you are creative. The difficulty of that of course relies on how much you bend the canon in your fic.

*** So? Just say that Jugson or Wilkes or whoever had always had a crush on Alice Longbottom. Or, more interesting, that some /female/ Death Eater we don't know about lusted after /Frank/, and /he/'s the one who sacrifices himself. How'bout that?

*** One reason that works for canon Voldemort is Alice being a pureblood "of noble stock" according to Voldemort at the Battle of Hogwarts.
