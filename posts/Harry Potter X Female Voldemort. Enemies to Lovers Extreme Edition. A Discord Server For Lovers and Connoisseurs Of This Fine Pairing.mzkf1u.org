** As one of ACI100's Patreon supporters, I feel like I need to clear up a misconception here. Ashes of Chaos is not officially Hemily. There is no confirmed pairing for the series as of yet. However, ACI100's side project --- Conjoining of Paragons --- is a Hemily fic.

*** I meant Ashes of Chaos as in it features a female Voldemort. Not that it has a Harry x Fem Riddle pairing. (In his server too, so it's not hard to miss lol)

Is the wording too confusing at that part?

**** It was a little confusing at first read. I can see the intent though reading through it again.
