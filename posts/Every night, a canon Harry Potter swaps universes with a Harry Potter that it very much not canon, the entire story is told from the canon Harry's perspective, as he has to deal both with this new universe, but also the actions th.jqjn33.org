I don't much care what this other universe is like, it could be a WBWL universe, or a dark harry universe, or even a universe where everyone's head's inside out.

Also, it's your choice if it's literally the bodies that are switching, their minds, or something else entirely. All that I really care about is that the only way the reader can figure out what the other harry is doing is when the original harry finds out


** ooh and then also make an accompanying fanfiction (maybe by another author to make it interesting?) that shows from every alternate harry perspective (i did not know how to make that into correct english but i hope you understand)

** Hey, so I am thinking of writing from this, but to do it properly, I have a few questions.

1. Is it also the night in the alternate timeline?
2. Would they switch at a certain time, say, once it reaches 7 pm, Harry is in the alternate universe or is it when they fall asleep?
3. what do you imagine possible to happen if it is night? General havoc?

I really like the idea, and plan on writing on the prompt regardless, but want to know some things from it.

*** 1. I mean, when I made the prompt I assumed yes, but it's up to you
2. I was thinking that it swapped over at a particular time, midnight was what my brain was telling me, but you can do whenever

** Somewhat related is Harry trying to find a power that his alternate selves might have (the Power /his/ Voldemort doesn't know) but he keeps coming across useless AU's.

The fic is Wizard of the Kaleidoscope which I love the first half of.
