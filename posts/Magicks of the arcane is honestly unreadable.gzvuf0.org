It had BIG warning signs quite early on, but since the magic itself was quite interesting and people seem to like it, I just ignored it...

But as the chapters went on it just got worse and worse. The line that broke me was Harry saying he wasn't racist, but that he didn't usually go for black women. Just.... Could a fic objectify women any more? Is there any way to sound more racist to say I'm not racist and then follow it up with a but?

I'm honestly sad that a writer who honestly wasn't bad at writing decided to ruin it by adding unnecessary parts about Harry being Horny.


** OK, I haven't read the story (and I won't, I promise), but saying “I am not a racist, but I don't go for black woman” seems to me the equivalent of “I prefer blondes to brunettes”. One time it is about the colour of skin, next time the colour of hair. What's wrong with that?

*** The problem is that the fact he needs to specify that. It's the part he needs to specify I'm not racist. Why was that part there. Why couldn't it have just been that woman over there had the biggest boobs I've ever seen.

On top of that.... he wasn't saying that he prefers one type, he was saying he DOESN'T prefer another, which are completely different.

Saying I prefer blondes is... completely normal. Telling a woman I don't usually really care for brunettes, but you have the biggest boobs I've ever seen..... is not alright.

PS: Read it if you want, I don't care much if somebody else reads it or not lmao

**** OK, I haven't read the story, so it could be said in otherwise horrible context, true. And yes, telling the brunette girl that you don't care for brunettes is rude, no question about that.

And saying that I am not a racist ... it is stupid, but I met girls who tried to explain by many horrible ways why he doesn't care about her (fortunately, not me) ... let's not go there.

And in the current culture, people in some environments (US academia) may be afraid that whatever they say about somebody of other colour of skin may be interpreted badly.

***** Yeah. I think it's a damn rude thing to say to someone, but I also just find it irritating when someone expresses some form of preference for romantic partners, and it's treated like bigotry on the same level as using a racist epithet.

That said, I haven't read the fanfic in question either, so I'm not sure as to the context.

****** I definitely agree it is full on same as bigotry... but it definitely has some racist undertones and combined with the off putting way the story treated women...

It was the final straw.

******* Is it homophobic that I am not gay. Is me saying that some guy is hot but I am not gay wrong? This is what you are saying. People have preferences, you can say someone is attractive and not your type.

*** How is saying I found reading the story uncomfortable due to the way it was constantly objectifying women silly?
