First like to start off by thanking everyone for the incredible first I've found on this subreddit!

Okay, I love found family fics, especially ones where there's a slow build of trust and care and we really get to see Harry get the love he's been lacking. Some of my favorites are long crossovers where his actions during school/after the war caught attention from another group (xmen/avengers/others) and as they investigate they become a family (hopefully a complete/wip and not abandoned ðŸ˜…)

Doesn't have to be a crossover, just any fics where family is important really and bonus if it makes opposing ppl work together!


** I forgot it's name, but there's a hp x percy Jackson crossover. Turns out Poseidon is one of his ancestors & the basilisk venom has a bad reaction & he literally starts turning into a male lamia (not sure. Something like Medusa). So Medusa adopts him & when he grows up, he literally makes another place just for all the half blood kids, be they Roman or Greek. A safe place where they aren't trained as soldiers & made to fight monsters. You should find it on fanfiction net.
