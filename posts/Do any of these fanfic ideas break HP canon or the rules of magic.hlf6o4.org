This post sort of carries on from [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/dqwy2i/thoughts_on_this_fic_idea_with_a_squib_oc/][a previous one]] I posted on the subreddit, and contains some ideas that I would like to implement in the fanfic described in said previous post. Thus, reading the previous post might help understand this one. More to the point, I suppose I'm seeking opinions as to whether the ideas for the fic described in this post break anything in Harry Potter canon or might require severe suspension of belief and may seem unrealistic from a HP standpoint.

- One idea I have is that all the siblings in the fic, including the Squib OC, each have a unique accessory (such as a glove, bracelet, ring, tie clip and cuff links, etc.) that tracks the well-being of his/her siblings. Each accessory has the family's insignia on it and six colored gemstones, each representing one of the holder's siblings. As there are seven siblings, each one is represented by a color of the rainbow via the ROY G BIV acronym in birth order. For example, the Squib OC, being the middle child, is represented by green, and his accessory lacks a green gemstone. On the other hand, all of his siblings have a green gemstone on their accessories to represent him. The idea is that if one of the siblings is imperiled in some way, his/her gemstone on the other siblings' accessories will react in some way, immediately alerting his/her siblings to the fact that this person is in trouble and to go help him/her. There would be moments in the fic where the Squib OC runs into trouble and one or more of his siblings show up (probably through Apparition) to bail him out because they noticed his gemstone on their accessories reacting to him being in peril. I'm not sure how workable this idea is, since I don't know if HP canon allows for the existence of such accessories that are possibly tied to someone's life force and can trace their well-being. The accessories could also be construed as magical items and it might be a dicey prospect for a Squib to own something like that. Also, I would suppose that if the Squib OC's siblings keep coming to help or rescue him, that might be too much of a deus ex machina, so presumably, something should exist to limit how often this is a thing.
- Centuries ago, the Squib OC's family was once pure-blood, but quickly divested themselves of this status because they held no discrimination against Muggles and actually enjoyed their company. Several family members would marry Muggles and consequently, in the present day, the family names several Muggles and Squibs among their number. Incidentally, the family choosing to associate with Muggles has enabled them to thrive in the present day, both in terms of material wealth and numbers, in contrast to pure-blood families like the Blacks or the Gaunts and to a lesser extent, the Malfoys. The family is thus rather proud of being blood traitors. The question though, lies in whether the family business having a presence in both the Muggle and wizarding worlds (and probably being one of the very few companies with this distinction) is a doable proposition. Presumably, it might be difficult, since the company having both Muggle and magical employees in close proximity might lead to possible offenses against the Statute of Secrecy.
- Because the Squib OC's family has some magical enemies, the Squib OC (and to a lesser extent, his Muggle and Squib relatives) are often targeted by said elements for attack because they perceive him to be a weak spot, which is partly why his father created those accessories for his children. So that the siblings can better look out for each other. Additionally, the Squib OC is very adept at resisting the Imperius Curse, because his father trained him to do so by casting the curse on him and having him practice resisting it until he gained (near-)immunity. This would be revealed early on when a magical enemy uses the curse on the Squib and his Muggle friends. The Squib plays along and pretends to be controlled like his friends were, until he gets a chance to sucker punch the enemy, and does so. I'm not sure if this idea is workable, in part because I don't know if it is possible for Squibs or Muggles to resist the Imperius Curse, even if they possess the same sort of strength of character or willpower that would allow a wizard to do so. Does resisting the curse require some form of "magical resistance" that only a wizard might have? Also, I'd wonder if the Squib's OC's father can use the curse on him without getting into legal trouble for using an Unforgivable Curse on his son, even if the point of it was not malicious, but to train him to resist it. Barty Crouch Jr. used the curse on students in Goblet of Fire while disguised as Moody to demonstrate its effects, and didn't get in trouble for it. So presumably, some sort of exemption exists for using the curse depending on the intent of the caster.
- Before retiring to run the family business, the Squib OC's father used to have a career as a "Muggle-enhanced" Auror, in the sense that as a half-blood wizard with extensive knowledge of the Muggle world, he used both that knowledge and Muggle technology to do his job. In that capacity, he carried Muggle implements like tasers and handguns (perhaps enhanced with magic to avoid things like magical foes Transfiguring them into something harmless), and might've used them rather than his wand to disable threats. He might have been seen by his colleagues as weird or an oddball for doing so. As for his wand, the Squib OC's father lost an arm in his youth in an incident protecting one of his siblings, and replaced it with an enchanted Muggle prosthesis that functions pretty much like a human arm. His wand was custom made for him by family and the core is comprised of bone shards from his amputated arm. He doesn't typically wield his wand in the usual sense, and keeps it in a compartment in his prosthetic arm. Thus, he is able to cast spells by waving his prosthesis or making hand gestures like pointing or snapping his fingers. Because these gestures do not resemble typical wand movements and because he excels in non-verbal magic, as a magical combatant, the Squib OC's father is very difficult to predict. Most people are not even aware that he uses a wand or lost an arm and that his prosthesis is his magical conduit, so it also appears that he uses wandless magic as well, which adds to the unpredictability. The question of this idea is if it is possible or feasible for an Auror to use Muggle implements in doing his job, and also if you can actually make a wand using parts of magical humans, since one can interpret a wizard as being a magical creature like a dragon or phoenix or unicorn, whose body parts /are/ used as wand cores.
- At some point in the story, the Squib OC's parents would show up to save the Squib OC and his Muggle friends from a magical enemy, but then refuse to wipe the friends' memories of the magical incident afterwards, in part because they have taken a liking to their son's friends over a few years of knowing them. At that juncture, the Squib OC's parents believe that continuing to hide the knowledge of magic from them is not a practical or justifiable proposition. This is in line with a theme of the story in the question of whether or not the continued segregation of the wizarding world from the Muggle one is a practical or ethically just one, especially with incidents like the Calamity. I suppose an issue with this idea is that it could be seen as a violation of the Statute of Secrecy since the Squib OC's parents are willfully letting his friends in on the wizarding world and the fact that their other children (the Squib OC's siblings) are magical. So I'm not sure if such actions would led to them violating the statute. There are allowances in the statute wherein a wizard could reveal the existence of the wizarding world to a Muggle spouse, but I'm not sure if the statute extends to say, the Muggle friends of a Squib child. It could possibly be too much of a stretch.
- The Squib OC's uncle (the younger brother of the Squib OC's father) is or was an Unspeakable that has done research into esoteric branches of magic, such as time magic, to the point where he has become exceedingly skilled at it. In particular, his research has delved into manipulation of the time-space continuum. To wit, he has developed the ability to travel through time without ill effects and without a Time Turner (and also possesses the ability to make "true" Time Turners). He is also capable of "warping" between locations. While the effect is functionally the same as Apparition, the mechanisms are distinctly different and thus, this character is capable of teleporting into and out of locations that cannot be Apparated into or out of. This ability is such that he is capable of inter-continental travel rivaling the most powerful of Apparition practitioners, though he can also time travel to escape others. This makes the character exceedingly difficult or even almost impossible to physically contain, since he can escape from custody with laughable ease. The character has also exhibited abilities that seem to break normal magical convention. One example is that if a person Disapparates in his presence, he can reach into the time-space continuum and "pull" that individual back to his location, which in turn, makes him very difficult to escape from. He is also capable of stranding people in other time periods with no easy way back to the present. It is of debate as to whether some of his abilities constitute "magic" in the conventional sense, because some of them are very unlike what people consider to be "magic". Of course, the main issue with this idea is that there may be no allowance for such abilities in HP canon, or even if there are, such abilities would likely be story breaking powers. It could be suggested that the character has "pushed the boundaries of magic" like Voldemort did, thus explaining why he could have powers that no wizard has been seen to possess, but that seems like a sketchy justification, if any. I suppose some limitations need to be applied to this character to keep him from being too overpowered.
- I am possibly looking into making the character a fugitive from the wizarding world, possibly for offenses such as dangerous experimentation into things like the workings of time or making illegal "true" time Turners. If so, then he will make extensive use of his abilities to constantly escape from the wizarding authorities or imprisonment in Azkaban. It should be noted that this character is more of an anti-hero or anti-villain (depending on interpretation) and I see him as more of an amoral agent of fate or "trickster entity" that puts others through "trials" by offering power for some goal that only he can fathom, as well as someone who is very good at planning and has backup schemes upon backup schemes for nearly every contingency. Most people simply see him as a dangerous threat to society, and few, such as his family, truly seem to understand him. The character does care for his family, but not in any way most people would see as conventional though.
- My thoughts are that the Squib OC's uncle was acquainted with Grim Fawley, the Unspeakable that caused the Calamity. He could also be acquainted with at least some of the London Five and thus understands Fawley's motivations in causing the Calamity. However, the character may not be above exploiting the fallout from the Calamity for his own goals and ends. Since it was speculated that Fawley cast a spell that caused the Calamity, which clearly affected the time-space continuum, it could be a "canonical basis" to the unusual abilities the character possesses as well. The character could be privy to Fawley's whereabouts and may know how to stop or mitigate the effects of the Calamity, but refuses to divulge anything because he either sympathizes with Fawley and/or it suits his own ends. It is likely that the character has a low opinion of Gareth Greengrass, the senior Unspeakable who investigated the disappearance of the London Five and closed the case without finding them. If the character has a (possibly personal) connection to at least one of the London Five, he'd certainly make attempts to find them. The character might also share the opinion of his brother and nephew (the Squib OC's father and the Squib OC, respectively) that concealing the wizarding world from Muggles is a dubious and impractical prospect in the long run.

Anyway, those are some ideas for the fic that I am trying to work out the feasibility of and if they can adequately fit with the conventions of HP canon. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.


** If you're setting this in Britain, drop the weaponry. Police aren't routinely armed and they're never allowed to keep their firearm when retired. Handguns have also been completely banned since the Dunblane massacre. Guns are not routine here.

Tasers are also not routine, and it is illegal for a civilian to possess one.

*** This may be true where Muggles in Britain are concerned, but I would wonder if those rules apply to wizards. If a wizard got a hold of a firearm and stayed within the wizarding community out of sight of Muggles, would most wizards even notice or care? Would the wizarding world even be bothered to enforce gun legislation passed by Muggle governments in the country? Given that most wizards are ignorant of Muggle technology or actively look down on and underestimate it, I don't believe that they'd really bat an eye at it. The same argument goes for the taser. It seems unlikely that the wizarding community would care about the Squib OC's father owning and using one if it got the job done in his capacity as an Auror and he kept it out of the Muggle world.

In story, the Squib OC's father used a firearm simply because it was faster to draw and fire one versus having to flick out a wand and chant an incantation and use a hand gesture to perform a spell. He also is very aware that most wizards know nothing of firearms so it's an easy and obvious way to catch people off guard in combat. He may be aware that he is actively flouting gun and weapons legislation in the UK by using firearms or tasers, but then again, as a wizard, no Muggle cop can arrest him, and he could simply erase the memory of any Muggle who sees him using these things.

If the Squib OC's father keeps his weapons in the wizarding world, then the Muggle authorities wouldn't even know of them to begin with. So the laws may not be applicable to wizards based on context and how the weapons are used or located. And would the wizarding authorities even care that this character owns such weapons? As long as those things got the job done without too much trouble and a protracted conflict is avoided, probably not. Once again, why would wizarding authorities even enforce Muggle gun legislation? As long as the Squib OC's father isn't going around shooting random wizards like those deranged spree shooters or planning some sort of mass shooting or terrorist attack, I can't see the wizarding community batting an eye at his weapons ownership. Furthermore, the character was once an Auror, essentially a wizard cop, so it cannot be strictly said that he is/was a "civilian".

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

But they can't arrest him, since he can simply stun them, wipe their memories so they wouldn't even know he committed an offense and thus wouldn't even know to arrest him, and he can also simply Disapparate to escape them completely. And it's not just him. Any wizard with a decent amount of skill can do any or all of these things to Muggle police that try to arrest them. And that doesn't get into the fact that the Squib OC's uncle can bust him out of any potential confinement with relative ease. Why do you think Muggle police never managed to arrest any Death Eaters despite their atrocities against Muggles? Because they can do all of what I just described in the first sentence AND they won't have any qualms about using Unforgivable Curses against Muggle police that try to arrest them.

Which is why the Squib OC's father has various ways to acquire such. Guns may be illegal in /Muggle Britain/, but are they illegal in /wizarding Britain/? Absent of a statement from Rowling, this cannot be definitively stated. It is already clear that laws are not the same between Muggle and wizarding jurisdictions in the same country.

I will not drop the idea without a reasonable cause. Since they are not part of the culture, that's why everyone else isn't packing such weapons. It's just the one guy. As for it "not working", that really depends on the context. The fictional world is not a one-for-one equivalent to how things are in real life.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

If I was "shoving norms", then everyone in the story with the inclination would be packing firearms, which is clearly not the case, so it can be hardly called a "norm". Once again, it's just one guy. One guy doing something does not make it a "norm". I highlighted that the character's Muggle attachments (which is a byproduct of his upbringing) even makes him be seen as weird by his wizarding peers, so that inherently bucks the notion that his behavior is a "norm".

#+begin_quote

Not necessarily. The Britain that Rowling wrote in HP canon is clearly distinct in some ways from the Britain in real life. So she took some liberties there. Does that automatically make her writing terrible? No. So automatically saying "it doesn't work" is patently untrue.

Please research the UK and British culture. You are absolutely shoving American norms onto the US if you insist on your character using guns. Drop it. It doesn't work over here.

If you insist on a gun, a shotgun is significantly more convincing. They are technically still legal, but mostly owned by old farmer types. You would struggle to find anyone who owned one in the city, for example.

If your character is supposed to be ex police, or dual trained with the police and aurors, he would have had little to no firearms training.

There is no glamour to be viewed here. The character is actually quite pacifistic. I think the thing that matters is his attitude towards the weapon and owning and using it. If he treats the thing with a certain gravitas or admits that he hates holding it but accepts it as a necessary evil on balance of probabilities, that's hardly glamorizing. Wielding a gun or sword does not make it glamorous since individual views on the wielder's part do matter.

I've done the research, and decided that this was an acceptable deviation, considering the cultural differences between Muggles and wizards and how the latter group generally underestimates and looks down on Muggle technology. It's not a "norm" if it's one guy. A norm is by definition something usual and expected, but one guy bucking a trend or even being seen as odd due to his behavior does not make a norm. So I am absolutely not shoving American norms into Britain.

I will /not/ drop it without reasonable cause, and simply saying "drop it" is not convincing. Once again, what you are describing is something that Muggles observe.

Funny thing is, I'm not American. And the story does not turn people in "gun toting idiots", given that the one guy with the weapon is actually intelligent enough to be a "Muggle enhanced" Auror, so he's hardly an "idiot". You don't see that many such individuals simply because most wizards are ignorant of or underestimate Muggle technology. But I daresay that if someone like an Auror is well-versed in Muggle tech and weaponry and can make bombs or biological weapons, then he is very intelligent indeed. Such people are actually quite dangerous. To say that a story is "poor quality" on scant basis is premature and not strictly applicable to the scenario at hand.

The character was an Auror, but picked up an assortment of Muggle skills such as the knowledge of how to use a gun, through his upbringing, since he has deep attachments to both the Muggle and wizarding worlds. It's simply an aspect of how this rich family raises its young. The family is just generally well-versed in Muggle workings since they have a significant number of Muggle and Squib members.

#+begin_quote
  If you insist on shoving American gun culture into a story about British characters, your writing will be terrible and the story will be unreadable to anyone with more than a passing knowledge of Britain. Drop the gun idea.

If it's one guy who used a gun back when he was in wizard law enforcement and is now retired, but still kept his weapons around, then I think it's fine. It's on the whole a small aspect of the story anyway and he's not going to be going around packing that sort of heat until shit really hits the fan later on down the road in the story. Therefore, I daresay I am not shoving a "culture" in the story since once again, not every Tom, Dick, and Harry is packing such heat. It is premature to say that the writing is terrible without context or reading any actual parts of the story. And to be frank, my British friends have no issue with this anyway, and they have more than a passing knowledge of the country. So to say that it will be unreadable to any British person is patently untrue. Once again, I am not dropping the idea without reasonable cause.

When giving an opinion, I don't advocate for people to out and out drop their ideas but suggest how it can best be integrated into the story in as close to the original spirit of it as possible. I also don't go around and say that inclusion of a seemingly "bad" idea automatically equals bad writing or a bad reception from the readers, because that simply is not always the case, and I've seen many stories that are examples of this.

In the context of the Calamity, the gun idea is hardly ridiculous. Without spoiling too much, it is a subtle hint as to the impact of the Calamity. Fact of the matter is, the Calamity is a serious mutilation of the time-space continuum, and the story explores its effects on society and also the fabric of reality. The Squib OC's uncle sees his brother with a gun and no one bats an eye at it, even in a region where this /should/ be the case. Why?

In part because it is a symptom of the damage caused by the Calamity on time and space. It is a dead giveaway that the Calamity is having a more serious effect on the time-space continuum than most in the know suspected. And one of the few who picks up on this is the character's brother. Admittedly, the twist and a few other deliberate incongruities from the research I did was the point all along, and garnered the approval of my British friends. That aside, is it your choice and that of anyone else on here to read the story or not. I am not dropping the gun idea.

** I skimmed through this post and most of your previous post as well.

I feel like you could easily “break cannon” magic if it is explained in a plausible way. The only issue/difficulty I have with this is the uncle who is quite OP. Plucking people out of apparating, etc just seems like such a powerful wizard that unless you have an equal to go against them it would be difficult to have any meaningful stakes.

That being said, as long as you're able to make the story appropriately dramatic and properly explain your changes to cannon w/o too much blocky exposition, then I don't reckon readers would complain.

Hopefully this helps! If not I can try again, lol

Good luck on the fic!!

*** Thanks for the response, and I would say that yes, the Squib OC's uncle could seem rather OP, since he does have a bunch of abilities that no one in HP canon has demonstrated. I do have some hard limitations on him still though, such as that the character could travel through time, but perhaps he still won't do things like try and stop Voldemort's rise to power, since he is cognizant enough to know that even with time travel, there are some things you really don't mess with. Of course, there are other limits on him like that he cannot willfully manipulate time like reversing it or speeding it up or freezing it and of course, he's not a reality warper. But those seem obviously too high level anyway, since no one in HP canon has anywhere close to that level of power.

Apart from the physical constraints on his powers, direct limitations on what he can and cannot do, I could impose limitations on him that he may refuse to perform some actions even if it is within his power to do so for moral or character reasons. However, some people don't see those as "actual limitations" because the character could say, change his mind on not performing the action, and just do it, and there isn't anything that could stop him doing so. As you say though, pulling a Disapparated wizard back to the point of origin might be rather OP, and I could find a way to nerf it. Though that said, the character may still be able to easily pursue such people wherever they might go.

I would think that the Calamity mutilating time and space is a thing as well, such that maybe this character cannot travel to the time when it happened simply because time is far too mutilated there to allow for it, if that makes sense. The fact /a spell/ was canonically suggested to have caused the Calamity certainly hints that some spells can warp time and/or space and some clearly powerful individual wizards are capable of performing this magic. I certainly want to hint that the Calamity has had farther reaching impacts on time and space rather than just dumping Foundables where they shouldn't be, though. And that could come in the form of deliberately placed deviations from real life, such as say people in the UK using guns and no one batting an eye at it despite guns being illegal to own in real life by civilians. Such a deviation, among others, could be chalked up to the effects of the Calamity on mutilating time and space.

Any thoughts on other ideas regarding the story?

**** I think you can get away with having the uncle super OP with the time stuff if he is just pants at other parts of magic. Like perhaps he isn't the most competent of duelists or maybe he's very unstrategic/unimaginative in a fight.

I can't say I know what the Calamity is, but if you say it's a spell that caused it then it would be quite easy to put in your fiction that a particular wizard/group of wizards caused it and that gives you a very strong enemy to write into your story. You could go so far as saying their manipulation of time rivals the uncle. Or perhaps they just have very far reaching network of agents that can provide consistent resistance/conflict at all times.

I'm not sure it's appropriate for me to give suggestions to the writer on how they should write their story, so I'll stop here.

Sounds like you've got a good grip on things as far as your story is concerned. You don't need to be super well-versed in Harry Potter cannon to write a convincing AU if we're being honest. You can diverge from cannon lots without breaking the suspension of disbelief so long as it's reasonably explained in the story.

Like I said previously just make sure to intersperse that in the story so it's more of a show don't tell kinda thing. I dunno, it's your story you should have fun writing it and let people like me either read it or not. It'd be silly of me to say your premise is unrealistic when it's all about magic y'know?

Keep up the writing! Good luck

** Honestly, the 'rules' in Harry Potter magic are more like guidelines. They're constant... until they are inconvenient.

*** It seems that there are "rules" in HP magic, but if you push hard enough, you can break them and produce effects with magic that haven't been seen before. I mean, how does spell creation come about? However, outside of outliers like Voldemort, it appears that no one usually does this, simply because to do so requires a great amount of skill and power and also at times, for you to do some very unethical and/or horrendous things.
