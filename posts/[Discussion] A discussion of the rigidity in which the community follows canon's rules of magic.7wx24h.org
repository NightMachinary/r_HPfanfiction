The [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJH2VSfQvYM][courtyard fight scene]] in the Deathly Hallows (Part 2) remains one of my favourite moments of Harry Potter canon, both books and movies. I think we'd all agree it was a fantastic scene, but what I want to discuss here is the presentation of magic in that scene based on canon rules and how we could learn from it as a community.

The topic of magic in the HP fanfiction community is an odd one. The entire premise of the universe is built around this idea of magic, yet canon gives no strict rules on what exactly it is, or more importantly how one can use it. As a fanfiction community then, we draw and extrapolate what we can from what we're given in order to expand on the universe and magic itself. However we stare at canon and start asking questions that the source material is never meant to answer. What makes a wizard more powerful than another? What does it take to learn a spell? What is a spell?

As a community and as authors come up with our own answers. Be it magical cores, book learning, practical learning, or otherwise, we have come up with countless explanations as to how magic works and how wizards learn in this universe, yet we are limited in that as a community we are reluctant to write or accept a theory that can be shown to not fit a moment of canon. Therefore authors write magic systems that fit toe to toe with canon, resulting in little exploration of magic is or could be. In order to expand they then start making their characters more powerful by exploiting loopholes in canon's magic system, which results in them still being able to say they fit to canon.

Back to the clip, here we have an incredibly powerful 90 seconds of film, showing magic in nearly every shot. The screenwriters did not go into that scene with a list of what magic could or couldn't do. Instead they went in with a feeling they wanted to create, a struggle they wanted to show, and let that drive the representation of magic shown on screen. The prime example of this is Abeforth's patronus at the end of the scene. The music darkens, the dementors are swarming, and the 3 protagonists stare out into the swarming abyss. Then a boom of magic explodes around them, shielding them, protecting them, driving back the darkness. They look behind them and see a wizard standing tall, giving them hope. Even though there was no animal, no mist, you know exactly what spell was used. You feel it right into your very bones. Yet this patronus went against everything canon has previously described that spell to be, the point being that it doesn't matter.

If canon source material can transcend it's rules to reach out beyond what it has previously defined itself to be, then so can we. Not by nitpicking what canon has already said to provide work arounds or exploits, but by taking the ideas and building on them in a way that takes it and transcends it into something new. Try not to look at canon and see what is broken and can therefore be exploited whilst sticking "within the rules", look beyond, imagine better, and try to create something more.

There are authors out there doing that already and they are widely viewed as a tier above the rest. Take authors like inwardtransience, Taure, Newcomb, mizuni-sama etc. and look at what they do with magic and canon. They take magic from canon as a guide but are happy to disagree or change something to fit their story. I only wish more authors would do the same.

Thoughts?


** I agree. A prime example of Rowling not fully explaining an aspect of magic is The Trace.

Most fics relate The Trace being sourced from a wizard's wand. But then, how does Dobby alert the Ministry with his use of magic? Also, wouldn't Harry have gotten a letter about underage magic earlier from Dobby Apparating to his house?

How the fudge does the Ministry get The Trace activated onto children?

More importantly, contary to what some fics may say, Hermione never got a letter for underage magic before she boarded Hogwarts Express when she practiced a few spells.

Canon is murky when it comes to The Trace.

*** The Trace is a plot device to screw over Harry so he gets more sympathy from readers.

The Trace, as implemented in the Books, basically boils down to:

- If Tom Riddle wanted to commit murders, he could simply bypass it using his uncle's wand.
- But if Harry had to use magic to save his life, it would always get him!

--------------

If you want to discuss about the mechanics of the Trace, here is my take:

First of all, the Trace was not active in Wizarding locations at all. That should explain why:

- Hermione could use spells in Hogwarts Express and Diagon Alley without problems.
- Riddle could use magic to stun and memory charm his uncle.
- The Ministry Six could use magic inside the DoM without alerting anyone.

Second, it was heavily location based. The Ministry looked carefully at places where Muggleborns and Muggle-raised lived, that was how they caught Dobby and thought it was Harry.

Third, there had to be wand based tracking, just to get those kids trying to flash their magic in Muggle locations. I believe this was the way how Harry was caught in OOTP. However, when he wandlessly cast the Lumos a moments before, no alert was triggered. Since he was still some distance away from home, I believe the Trace activated here was not location based. Further evidence supporting wand based tracking was how Tom Riddle killed his father without settling off the Trace.

Finally in DH, Moody explained the Trace as trying to sense magic around underage wizards at all times. This explanation significantly violated several above mentioned cases. It also violated the cases where Tonks and Dumbledore cast several spells around Harry in OOTP and HBP respectively. IMO, JKR just wanted to force an aerial shootout and kill off more good guys. She even mentioned in her interviews that consistency in world building took a backseat to plot requirements.

As conclusion, I think fic writers have significant freedom in implementing the Trace in their stories. I personally favor a combination of wand and location based tracking as this implementation would explain the greatest majority of examples in the Books.

Maybe it triggers on magic that originates within a certain radius of the underage wizard? Harry was probably trying to restrain Dobby when he did the Hover Charm, whereas Tonks might have been a few metres away when she packed his bag.

EDIT: Also, Harry was in the vicinity of Privet Drive whenever he was caught. Riddle's address was in London at the time, and he didn't commit the murders there. The muggles were dead, and Morfin had no recollection of his nephew, so they had no evidence that Tom Riddle was the one whose Trace was triggered. (Tom Marvolo Riddle would probably have been suspected [underage wizard with the same name as one of the victims] if his uncle didn't confess and possess the 'smoking gun' in question.)

*** I think the trace works in two parts part one is area specific and is applied to the residence of every underage student living in the muggle world. This why Harry gets in trouble for Dobby's magic magic happened at Harry's address he is at fault case closed. The second part is based on wands and applied by Olivander (and other wand makers) when underage wizards buy them. However, there is a loophole with the second part the magical protections most Wizarding homes have block this trace. This is how Tom Riddle is able to take his uncle's wand and kill his muggle relatives. It also adds a nice bit of antimuggle born discrimination which fits in with the setting.

*** Aye a good example, but can you see how you've explained every loophole and everything that isn't right with the trace as per what's strictly written in canon? Writing about an exemption in the canon description of the Trace that allows the main character to beat it is a very typical example of the problem I'm trying to bring up and discuss.

Why can we not look past what is explicitly stated and go forward with what it's trying to be. Forget that there are contradictory bits of evidence, or things that don't add up, and go forward with the idea that kids can't /legally/ do magic outside Hogwarts? The execution of that presumption can be made to best fit the story, rather than trying to find ways to "beat" how canon did it.

*** The ministry was alerted when Harry blew up his aunt, and that was when his wand was stowed away in his trunk.

Also, it might have been something in the unforgiveables that interferes with the Trace, or Riddle could have found a way to disable the Trace (the bloke was a genious after all). In addition, Riddle used underage magic in Little Hangleton, and not in Wool's Orphanage, so they couldn't automatically pin it on him. There might also have been differences in how the Trace worked in 1943 vs 1992.

(If the DMLE hadn't gotten a confession from Morfin, as well as the Priori Incantado evidence, Tom Riddle Jr would probably be their next suspect.)

** I don't really give that much of a shit for the movies, but god damn, that courtyard scene was beautiful. I get chills every time I watch it. And the way it goes over their first three years... Troll, spiders, werewolf, dementors.

** It's interesting that you use myself and [[/u/Newcomb][u/Newcomb]] as examples of willingness to depart from the canonical magical system, as (having spoken with him extensively about this) I believe we consider ourselves as operating largely within it. We expand upon it, make many things explicit which were merely implicit in the books, but ultimately our aim is to produce magic which feels like it would belong in the canonical world.

I suppose the distinction which may create the impression that we depart from canon is that we place thematic and tonal consistency with canon over factual consistency. Specific items of magic can be changed, or expanded upon, so long as the whole remains canonical in feel.

*** Let me just say that this was always what I took from your writing, if you disagree then I apologize for making the assumption!

I feel however we are in agreement on this, though feel to debate me on it. My thoughts aren't about departing from canon, but rather letting yourself build on it and staying true to the tone and ideals, without limiting yourself to the specifics of how canon explains things. I feel both you and Newcomb are perfect examples of that, as is the movie clip (I really love that clip).

Some authors will just take canon as rote, only going by what is explicitly mentioned because if they break away from that then it would be going "against" what canon has defined. They're happy to create something new, but won't go against what's been previously stated in canon.

Others like yourself take the ideas canon presents and build on them, even if it may go against random tid bits from the books, because it fits your story better. To take an example from Victoria Potter, in the latest chapter you talked about the restricted section. In canon, the idea is about an area of the library students can't access, yet we're never told about other areas of the library, or if there are multiple levels of access.

You took the idea that canon was portraying and built on it without worrying that you were changing a canon element in execution (but not in theme), and it's something I wish more people were willing to do.

Does that help explain my thoughts?

** I follow and keep canon things when there's no need not to, but if I come up with some new character, or place, or aspect of magic, or a species or a culture that I want to use in my story then I'm going to use it exactly how it is in my head, and I'm not going to try too hard to MAKE IT FIT into canon. It wouldn't be a fanfiction if it did, anyway. I could write giant flying purple monsters from another dimension or something, in an alternate world where Nazis won world war 2 and then discovered a way to create magical supersoldiers! Just, you know, if I really wanted to! :) And I wouldn't care what anyone else thought or had to say about it, cause fanfiction itself literally has the definition in a dictionary as being "Not canon!" :) That, and that I write my stories for myself and my own entertainment, so no one and nothing else matters ANYWAY.
