What are the fanfics that have shaped this fandom the most? Fics that spawned famous tropes and cliches, fics with new concepts that have now become fanon, etc...


** I /think/ Dethryl's "They Shook Hands" series spawned a lot of the Slytherin!Harry tropes that are used nowadays. The original pre-rewrite series started in 2001 which I think makes it one of, if not the first full-length light side slytherin!Harry series.

Robst's fics have influenced a /lot/ of independant!Harry fics to the point where if you've read one of them, you've read all of them. Not something I'd personally reccommend reading though, I can't get myself to read any of them all they way through.

*** Bobmin came a long time before robst, and his fics were equally popular, maybe even more so, getting 3000-4000 reviews on a story hosted on a website that wasn't ffn. So I would say if anybody had a huge influence on independant!Harry tropes, it would be him. Not saying robst didn't, but he came a 4-5 years later and built on Bobmin's ideas.

And different from robst, I can still get through his fics today without perma-cringing. Re-read "Sunset over Britain" and its sequel just a few months ago. So sad he died before he could finish his epic, and highly recommended, Harry Potter & Dragonriders of Pern crossover trilogy.

I would say [[https://www.fanficauthors.net/]] overall is a good starting point to find very influential fics. It was a really big deal back then if Jeconais invited the author to become a part of it, it was pretty exclusive.

** My Immortal and HPMOR, I think, were pretty controversial.

** I used to really love DisobedienceWriters fics. I think they had a lot of interesting ideas that played around with the tropes (Harry going to a different school (+free Sirius), powerful Harry in a different Hogwarts house, etc) I cant remember all of them but they're one of my favorites

** Not quite what you're looking for but we can't forget astolat who, in addition to writing some amazing HP fics, /created/ ao3, perhaps making her one of the most influential fic writers in any fandom! ;)

** /Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Future Past/ was one of the first Peggy Sue fics, where Harry sent his soul back in time after the War ended very badly.

It influenced an entire genre of fics, and even though it introduced a bunch of cliches--martial arts!Harry among them, but they still felt sincere, at least for me.

** Never read it, but you have to give a shoutout to the Draco Trilogy for spawning literally everything that defines the perceptions of Drarry and Dramione.

To me a lot of DLP-written fics have kind of codified the ways authors work around tropes, even if many of them haven't been super influential themselves just because of that community's urge to come up with original ideas. I think /Boy Who Lived/ is perhaps the most influential DLP fic, as it pretty much redefined how to write a decent WBWL story.

You probably have to mention HPMOR, although it's debatable whether the rationality fic community is separate from that of greater HP fanfiction.

For recent and/or ongoing fics, /Prince of Slytherin/ is massively influential on a lot of people who are now turning to writing similar fics. /Victoria Potter/ is also pretty much revered as an effort to approach the perfect fanfic, but I haven't really seen any attempts to get close to it.

I think there was a pretty major trope introduced in /The Phoenix and the Serpent/ that's become common in fanfiction, but I can't remember for the life of me what it was. That fic is pretty unique though, even fifteen or whatever years on.

*** I was about to say the same. Actually the internet historian has a “feature animation” about my inmortal for his Sundance Rejects series. This has influenced more than fan fiction, it's part of internet culture
