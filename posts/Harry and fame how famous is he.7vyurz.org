The majority of british mages seem to believe the bwl story. Most dark mages who are politically aligned with harry's 'victim' probably don't believe it and believe someone else did it(dumbledore or his father if fanatical, his mother potentially). The prophecy naming harry as a child of prophecy would reinforce this for believers and perhaps change the mind of opposing forces who aren't addled.

So here's the question: how famous should harry be if this was real life? Should mages outside the uk believe the bwl story? Or should he be relatively unrecognized if in Japan or the US?

And with Harry becoming the head of the aurors how politically astute is he? One would have to assume he is as astute as he is at teaching, yes?


** As the Bulgarian Minister of Magic gets excited about meeting Harry, I imagine his fame reaches over most of Europe. As for the rest of the world, who knows.

So to the rest of the world Harry had fought and killed Voldemort again, and this time it was after he had successfully taken over the government.

** I think that people in a 'magical world' probably believe the story. But I think his fame outside of Britain is more of a 'know the name not the face' deal. I would suspect he could walk down the street of most major cities and not be recognized. But if asked most people would be able to say what Harry Potter did.

As for the Auror thing. It depends on how you think the department works. If it's like a sheriff position, those are typically elected by the populace. If it's like a chief of police position that's typically appointed by a Mayor. General competency and name could easily earn him a government appointment without having to do anything 'politically'. Political appointments reflect on the people making them, so it's not like they want to appear incompetent.

** Let me put it this way: Imagine if hitler had tried to shoot a child in the face and the bullet had ricocheted off it's bare flesh to send him into a permanent coma leaving the child with only a scratch and think about how well known that child would be. That's the ballpark.

** I think that outside of Brittain the story of "The-Boy-Who-Lived" would be well known, but the level and type of fame would depend on international relations/stereotypes I would think (bear with me). If the magical communities of the US/Japan view Brittain as backwater and/or racist hicks, then I don't think they would believe it. Know the story, yes. Believe it, not so much. However if US/Japan vuew British wizards with respect (like how our real world governments and people do) then they might believe that Harry took a killing curse to the face and lived.

Your question about him becoming head of the aurors doesn't make sense. If you are asking if he got the gig because of his teaching skills, I would disagree. If you are saying that a good teacher would be good at politicing, I would again disagree. If your are asking that hid skills at politicing are as good as his skills at teaching, and THAT got him the job, then yes, I would agree with that. From what I understand, the higher you go in a given field, the more your skills at politics comes into play, and fo be head of a department one would need to be reasonably good at it.

** Well, in canon, it seems like he's pretty well-known in Britain as he had unknown people bowing to him as a child. Like [[/u/TheAccursedOnes]] says, that fame probably stretches over most of Europe. Rita Skeeter certainly was able to use his fame to her advantage and it didn't really seem to matter whether people believed the whole "boy-who-lived" story or not.

In my own Potterverse, Harry continues being well-known in the UK into his adult life and the Auror department has few scruples of using that fame to their advantage and that's part of what drives him out to the US to a (hopefully) quieter life. The way I have it, the wizarding world in the US is certainly aware of him and children are taught about him in the course of Modern Magical History, but on the whole they just kind of shrug and move on, which suits him just fine.

As for the rest of the world, I can see where certain pockets of society would be more interested in him. Aurors and law enforcement from other countries, Dark Magic practitioners/researchers, educators ... but your regular witch or wizard not so much.

** I would say Harry is rather famous in the West, he's extremely famous in The UK and other neighbors. Like everyone knows what he looks like at the Tri wizard people point and whisper like at home. Let's say Harry goes to the US, 1 in 5 wizards would know off the top of their head who he is from visuals, 1 in 3 would know from his name only and everyone would know of someone said Boy Who Lived.

In the East I see it as mildly known by those who take in foreign media and even then their would be some doubt as to if what is said to have happen actually happened

** Fudge's opinion of Dumbledore managed to get him kicked from his position at the ICW and later reinstated, so I'd say that Britain isn't some backwater country that people crack jokes about.

** I'm a bit suspicious how people instantly recognized him. Who the heck spread detailed and accurate information on what he looked like? That whole scene in the Leaky Cauldron in the first book was very strange.

  Harry becoming the head of the aurors how politically astute is he?
#+end_quote

I can't understand why he would work for (and presumably take orders from) a Ministry that consistently treated him so badly.

If he was politically astute he'd be able to spot the difference between corrupted nepotism and democracy. And with his new fame, why didn't he try to get into a position of power in order to fix all the things that are so obviously wrong in the Wizarding world?

Harry is just like a modern-day celebrity. All fame and no brains. A magical Kardashian.

How do you know Harry did not use his Power to improve things ? I think your comparison to the Kardashians is too harsh, Harry was ready to sacrifice himself to save the world !
