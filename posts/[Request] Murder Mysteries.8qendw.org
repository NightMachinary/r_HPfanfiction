Preferably not Auror!Harry, but during the Hogwarts years. Bonus points if Ron is a (serial) killer because I listened to a podcast today that described his life exactly (no hate on Ron or anything).\\
I don't mind slash but I'm absolutely not interested in any pairings involving ANY Death Eaters/Voldemort.\\
Much thanks in advance!


** linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11815544/1]]) yeah its not set during Harrys Hogwarts years but pretty good, doesnt involve deatheater pairings and is complete !

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon... Winner of Mugglenet's Quicksilver Quill Awards 2016, Best Post-Hogwarts.

This fic features 4 major crime mysteries. Some canon bad guys are no longer bad, but there are also new bad guys!

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.

  A Hogwarts student is dead and it's up to Harry to find out why. Having nothing to go on and met only with the suspicion of his peers, he's forced into a temporary partnership with a mysterious Slytherin, promising him the information he needs to get his hands on before time runs out for him and everyone in the school.
