** I do not believe it is /awake/, as such. Poor Scardemort's life woud be quite the living hell. Remember, Lily's protections /confine/ the Horcrux in the scar, stopping it from affecting Harry. Having the Horcrux manage to wake up and reach out to Harry's soul is the premise of a couple of good stories, but it necessitates a worldbuilding explanation because it would /not/, all things being equal, have happened in canon. This being said, I do think the soul-piece, like all others, had the /potential/ to be conscious --- it had its own mind.

*** I think you may be mixing canon with fanon. Lily's protection had nothing to do with why the Horcrux was not affecting Harry. It was because of how weak and small compared to Harry's soul it was. Dumbledore clearly states it in the white Kings Cross. And I don't remember canon ever referring to to the /Scar/ being the Horcrux. Horcrux is an object that contains the fragment of a soul. How do you even separate one part of the body like that? It is where the Avada Kedavra hit Harry and may be the entry point for the soul shard, but not the Horcrux itself. /Harry/ is the Horcrux. Otherwise I agree with you on the soul shard that was in Harry not being awake.

**** You're right on Harry as a whole being technically the Horcrux. On the other hand, I don't think my idea that Lily's protection prevented the Horcrux from affecting his mind has been formally disproved by canon, either. I consider it quite likely that the "Voldemort can't harm Harry" rule extended to him.

** I agree with [[/u/Achille-talon]] but also add that Scardemort was most likely tortured into insanity by Lily's protection. Remember in the king's cross scene at the end of DH there was a broken child like thing huddled under one of the benches. That's all that was left of that piece of Tom's soul. Maybe enough to act as a horcrux but hardly enough to be aware or conscious. In SS Lily's protection was enough to burn Quirrellmort to cinders, and Scardemort was surrounded by that same protection 24/7 for at least 13 and a half years, assuming Voldemort's resurrection ritual also protected his horcruxes from her sacrifice.

*** I'd recommend checking out the first chapter of my story, linkffn(Tom Riddle and the Sorcerers's Stones). It's all the perspective of Scardemort. (EDIT: Re-GAH! That stupid Alexandra Riddle keeps being linked instead of mine!)

  Answer to Angel the Devil's Daughter's challenge. Harry is Voldemort's son and so on. How about reading it?
