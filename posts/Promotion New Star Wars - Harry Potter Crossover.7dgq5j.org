Holocron by Raven3182 (aka me)

Summary in case the bot doesn't work: Lost in a vast, underground system of caves, seven-year-old Harry Potter stumbles upon a glowing, blue cube that has lain forgotten in the darkness for thousands of years. Find out what happens when Harry embarks on his journey to Hogwarts with a Jedi Holocron in tow. The Force is strong with him, but a Jedi must always be wary of the power of the dark side...

New chapters on Saturdays. I've got a lot written already, so posting should be pretty regular for quite a while.

Check it out!

/Post edited to present new Story Summary (now v2.5!) based on comments. Old summary in case you care for some reason: Lost in a vast, underground system of caves, seven-year-old Harry Potter stumbles upon a glowing, blue cube that has lain forgotten in the darkness for thousands of years. +What will happen when young Harry brings his Jedi Holocron with him to Hogwarts? Do not underestimate the power of the Dark Side...+/


** Just wanted to pop in and say I've read your first three chapters and I enjoyed them. I think the plot concept has real promise and I would love to see you do great things with it. My only suggestion is that I would like to read more about what's going on inside Harry's head. How he's dealing with this very peculiar turn of events and his thoughts and ideas about what might be happening and how it affects his life. Also, if the Dursleys are going to be part of the story for much longer, you might want to dial down their behavior a bit. I found it a little too exaggerated.

Looking forward to more!

*** Thanks. Glad you're enjoying it. You'll get to see more from Harry's point of view soon, but I didn't want to bog things down with a long "young Harry in training" section. I thought that an outsider's perspective on Harry's initial training in the Force would get everything across more quickly and help things move forward to the actual plot. The Dursleys won't be around much longer. Like in canon, they tend to disappear once Harry gets to Hogwarts, which will be soon.

The next chapter will be posted on Saturday. Thanks for sharing your thoughts!

** The summary isn't appealing to me. I'm not a big fan of young!Harry fics where he's less than ~10 y/o. The way the Dursley's are written is a laughable (not humorously) fanon caricature of the way they are written in canon. Combine this with the mediocre writing, (probably 2-2.5 out of 5), and i didn't think I was going to find anything worth reading here.

That said, the journey into the cave was actually a decent hook. I found myself actually caring what happened to Harry and intrigued with the possibilities.

The fic has plenty of problems. The flow is pretty choppy with a lot of short, similar length chapters. You use a lot of redundant or throwaway words.

Neither Harry not the Holocron have a real personality or voice. It seems like you are just writing the dialogue to serve the plot, and not considering what they may actually say in response to one another. Edit: I wrote this paragraph about halfway through the second chapter. It definitely improves in the later half, and we do see some personality from Master Isu. I'd not expect anything too dramatic from Harry given that he's seven, but his characterization would probably benefit from some fun quirks.

I can't stress enough how truly offputting each and every scene with the Dursley's and Dudley's gang is. All of the antagonists have more or less the same personality and interact with Harry in the same way. You need to understand that each character should have a (at least a slightly) different relationship with Harry and a different manner of interacting with him.

It really seems like you have some view in your head of how the Dursley clan treats Harry and make all of them treat him in a way over the top exaggerated version of this. Some subtly would be nice. These parts were unreadable. I skipped through all of them.

The interactions between Harry and the holocron are enjoyable, though, and I think there is something there. The language is a bit on the dull side, but you have potential, and that's definitely something that improves with practice, so just continue trying to get better.

It's a decent start. I'd be careful not to get too bogged down in the details while Harry is super young. Nobody wants to read 10 chapters of seven year old Harry beating up Dudley and and co.. Keep the pace up and try to progress into Hogwarts age in the next few chapters with some carefully executed time skips.

Would be interested to read more.

*** Thanks for sharing your thoughts, it's nice to receive some criticism. But to address some of your points...

It's not going to be a young!Harry fic - I move past that very quickly. The next chapter will take place in 1991. We see some of first year, but then the time skips come quickly as I'm not interested in doing a canon-rehash.

When it comes to the Dursleys, they're not really central to the story, and it moves past them pretty quickly. However, I would argue that they do interact with Harry in different ways and have different relationships with him. Vernon doesn't really have much screen time, but I tend to see him as just a bitter, angry man, a bully that grew up to find that his childhood strength didn't translate well into adulthood, making him largely impotent, but still eager to hurt people that can't fight back against him one way or another. So there's that. Petunia is resentful and bitter, and kind of like Snape; she dislikes Harry because he's a constant reminder of her past. I tried to bring that out during her scene in Chapter III. Dudley is a vicious bully and probably borders on a bit of sociopathy. He's learned to hate his cousin from his parents and really just wants to hurt him. You also mentioned that you found yourself skipping over their scenes - if you did that, well, then I can see why you didn't find much difference in their characterizations, you didn't read them. But, if you ultimately don't like the way I characterize the Dursleys, and that seems to be your biggest complaint, there's not a whole lot more I can say, other than that they don't play a very large roll in the story going forward.

As for what you've said about my writing style, well, to each their own. I've made some deliberate choices in that area - the short chapters and brief sentences being two. If you're looking for another Hemingway, you're probably not going to find him writing fanfiction. I'm writing in my spare time for fun, take from it what you will. Ultimately, on this point it comes down to what the Romans used to say, /De gustibus non disputandum est./

If you'd like to see more, the next chapter will be posted tomorrow, and it starts to move beyond your hated Dursleys. If you've had enough, thanks for giving it a shot!

  Thanks for sharing your thoughts, it's nice to receive some criticism.
#+end_quote

Awesome, good to see you have a positive attitude. I was afraid I may have come off a little harsh or aggressive. That was not my intention as you appear to have gleaned, so props to you.

I actually took the time to shop your fic around IRC/Discord a bit. The few people who responded seemed to be in general agreement with my position (although perhaps I may have led them a bit as I offered my opinion before I gave them a chance to fully read it).

There were varying levels of interest in the story ranging from complete disinterest to the story having an interesting premise and overall potential.

#+begin_quote
  You also mentioned that you found yourself skipping over their scenes - if you did that, well, then I can see why you didn't find much difference in their characterizations, you didn't read them.
#+end_quote

Very fair point. I certainly did not give their sections a deep evaluation. I am sorry for that, and you can largely disregard any previous specifics I gave. I've taken the time to read through the Dursley/Polkiss sections, so I can give an informed review.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

The one point of absolute agreement on IRC was is that your characterization of the Dursleys was way over the top and pure one-dimensional bashing. Unreadable--this was the concensus.

I'm glad that you seem to have put forth a bit of thought into Vernon, Petunia and Dudley, that is encouraging, but your explanation of their personalities is extremely one dimensional and cliched. You explained that "they don't play a very large roll in the story going forward," so any issues with them shouldn't matter in the long run. I'm troubled by this.

You have to understand that they play MAJOR role in the introduction to the story, and the way you wrote them is going to annoy a lot of readers to the point of them abandoning the fic. If you don't care about that, then by all means ignore this advice, but you should seriously consider revising this section based on--in part-- the specifics I am listing below:

- *Freak:* Your use of the word "freak" is very hamfisted. I took the time you glance at my copy of Chamber of Secrets (couldn't find PS), and the only instance of the work I could find was Dudley saying "haven't you even got friends at the freak place." Vernon usually calls him "boy." I would definitely expect them to call him "/freak/" when he does something they interpret as magical but not EVERY time they say something to him.

- *Autonomy/Depth:* Your antagonists (and to a lesser extent, you protagonists, but it's not nearly as bad) don't seem to have any autonomy. It reads like they are following a script of what the author needs them to say to move the plot in the direction he wants. They don't feel like /real people/. They were complete and utter douche bags and a bit over the top in canon, but nowhere near what's in your fic. They just come off as fanon caricatures that have no autonomy, depth, dimensional or believably.

- *Attention:* One major theme in canon is that the Dursley's would love for Harry to disappear. They try to enjoy their lives and ignore him wherever possible, but sometimes (and your example of them being forced to take him to the caves would qualify) they are forced to deal with him, and they take out their frustrations on him. In your fic, all of the Dursley's seem to be focused on Harry 100% of the time. It would benefit greatly if we saw them trying to live their lives and begrudgingly berating him when he intrudes on their self-centeredness.

- *Dynamic:* This is more directed at Dudley's gang. You don't seem to have thought through the group power dynamics much here. This is a relatively minor complain, but it was distracting that both Piers and Dudley seemed to be in charge and different times without any competition between them.

These are my main complaints with the Dursley's through chapter three. I hope you at least read these and consider making some edits, because I really do think you'll lose a lot of people due to these sections.

That said, I would be remiss if I didn't offer some *positive feedback* as well, because I did notice some things upon further inspection that I thought you did quite well.

- *Perspective:* You did a good job in changing POV from one character to another. I thought your versions of Harry and the Holocron were a bit dry and I thought that was lack of skill, but I'm thinking that it might be either intentional or perhaps oversights, because you did a great job with the antagonists in giving them unique voice when inside their heads. Petunia, while I thought she was way over-the-top (as I mentioned before), had a unique head space, and the type of descriptions and language you used in her sections were distinct and pretty amusing at times. In Piers's sections, I really liked how you referred to Harry as "Potter" and the verbiage you used was fitting for him. There were a couple parts I noticed where you inserted some omniscience or narrator commentary/opinion ("poor thing" when referring to Piers/Dudley hitting the cat), but nothing major.

- *Vocabulary/Word Choice:* For some reason, your vocabulary and word choice (especially for imagery) were /substantially/ better from the antagonists's POV, especially Petunias. Why didn't you put in the same effort for Harry's sections? It looks like you have it in you, but it's a but inconsistent.

This is fair, and any criticisms I gave weren't to say you were incapable, just commentary on this specific piece.

I will say that some of my concerns (bland vocabulary and character voice) were much better in the antagonist parts that I skipped, which seems backwards to me. Seems to me like you have a bit of inconsistency problem.

/Do you have a beta?/ That might help a lot. I don't really have time to be a full time beta, but I'd give detailed feedback one chapter if you are interested.

One last piece of advice, Harry seems to be building into a Garry Stu. Please keep an eye on that. If there aren't moments in the story where Harry fails dramatically, and it's his fault, and he has to come to terms with it, then you have a Gary Stu on your hands.

Hope this helps! Keep on writing!

***** Thanks for responding again. A few points for you:

*1.* Don't worry about hurting my feelings -- I'm a grown man not a thirteen-year-old writing their first Ginny-angst songfic. I'm capable of discerning actual criticism and differentiating it from fanboy hate or trolling. That being said, if you're often worried about your posts coming off in the wrong way while you're trying to give thoughtful advice, try moderating the tone of your writing. For example, in your original post you said, “The way the Dursley's are written is a laughable (not humorously) fanon caricature...” The word ‘laughable' carries with it certain connotations and can make the user sound pretentious, especially with the added ‘not humorously.' If instead you say something like, “The Dursleys come off as one-dimensional, a caricature based on fanon...” the same critical point is made without the overtone of condescension. Again, I was able to tell what you were trying to say, but if you're worried about your tone, work on it.

*2.* The Dursleys. Of course they're over the top because JKR herself presents them as over the top. I wrote a little piece about the Dursleys in my forum over on ffn (there's a link in my profile there) and I also already copied it to this thread down below in response to LocalMadman's comment. Take a look at it. But like I said, the Dursleys in canon are over the top and kind of cartoonish. What else would you call people that make their nephew sleep in a cupboard or put bars on his windows? And that's when the story is lighthearted. If you're writing a more serious story, then actions like those they take in canon would definitely be accompanied by other types of abuse. I really don't think it's a stretch to think that the kind of people that would lock a child in a cupboard for extended periods of time would also likely smack him around as well.

I disagree with your point that in canon the Dursleys just wanted Harry to disappear. If you just want someone to go away you ignore them, you don't do things like making them cook your meals, putting bars on their windows, telling the neighborhood that he's a criminal, driving however far to an island in the middle of the sea so he can't read a single letter, etc. Spending that much effort and energy isn't just dealing with him when it's absolutely necessary. Those actions speak of something much deeper on their part than a desire for Harry to disappear. Again, if you look at the story more seriously and not as a fairy tale, the only conclusion is that they hate him.

*2.1* The use of the word ‘freak' by the Dursleys was intentionally emphasized in the early chapters. I'm aware that it's a break from the canon depiction of the Dursleys, and perhaps I over did it a bit, but I don't think it's something that in any way takes aware from the narrative. I'm writing a different story after all, if I wanted to rehash canon, I'd just go read the books again. There need to be differences or else there's no point in telling another story than what JKR already published. Also, as I said, I was intentionally emphasizing the word because it lays the groundwork for something else that will occur down the line in the story. But you couldn't know that of course, the rest of the story isn't yet written, let alone published.

*2.2* I'm really not sure where you're getting confusing power dynamics in Dudley's gang; I think you're looking too hard and seeing something that isn't there. Dudley is clearly in charge in those scenes. In the first slingshot scene with just him and Piers, Dudley calls the shots. Piers really only speaks up ‘against him' when he demands a turn to shoot Harry with the slingshot. You also need to keep the respective ages of the children in mind. The first two scenes take place when they're seven or eight years old, their personalities are still developing and relationships are still forming. And eight year old demanding their turn isn't a power play -- it's just how eight-year-olds act. By the time you get to the scene in Chapter III, Dudley, now a little older, is clearly in charge. Until the gang realizes that there's something scarier in the neighborhood than he is, namely Harry.

*3.* You've mentioned that Harry's character voice is rather bland and lacking in description, vocabulary, etc, especially when set against the other characters' viewpoints. You're right. But again, that's by design. Harry is a rather passive character throughout canon, especially in the beginning where he's a lonely, isolated child. He lets things happen to him and just goes along with the flow. He's a character that gets swept up into adventure, he doesn't set out searching for it. Harry's honestly not very interesting on his own -- he's just another guy, an every-man. I'm certain that was deliberate on JKR's part and I've continued it in my own story. It's been a while since I've read the originals, but I honestly don't really recall seeing much personal agency from Harry until /Order of the Phoenix./ But that's okay. Kids don't have much agency in general. They pretty much do as they're told. Gaining that level of control over your life is part of the process of growing up. It's why old people like me find teenagers to be so annoying -- they're experimenting with how they're going to express their newfound personal agency. And most of the time it's through bad hair and angsty music.

*4.* At the end of your last comment you mentioned that “Harry seems to be building into a Garry Stu.” I /really/ don't know where you got that from in the only 10k words that you read. The story is still very much in its first stages, the primary exposition -- there hasn't really even been a conflict yet, let alone an opportunity for him to barrel through it without issue ala a Gary Stu. So I really don't think this criticism is fair and it seems like you just threw it on at the end as one more thing to say.

*5.* Not that I want to take on the role of armchair psychologist, but I think your criticisms betray something about you, namely, that you're suffering from the condition that I call ‘fanfic fatigue.' I should know, I've got it too. It's when you've read so damn much fanfiction that you begin to have automatic responses to things you read, even if the triggering element isn't really there. You see it the most around ‘shipping.' How many people simply flat-out refuse to read a fic because it has a Harry/Ginny paring (or any other particular paring)? It might be the greatest thing ever written, but because they've seen it done so poorly so many times over, they've developed an automatic negative response to even seeing the tag ‘Harry/Ginny.' Another example would be the reviews I get saying things like, “I can't wait until Jedi Harry sticks it to manipulative dumbledork...” Again, that has nothing to do with the story they're reading, they've just read so much that they automatically see those elements in every story. Likewise, I think you've got a similar bias going on with the Gary Stu thing, otherwise I'm at a loss as to why you mentioned it, as well as with the Dursleys. I've also had to wade through thousands of words of text only to read about how Harry's back was covered with scars from his uncle. I've rolled my eyes at most of them, even those few that actually made narrative sense. Developing some fatigue is natural in our chosen hobby -- I mean, there's over 778k Harry Potter fics posted on ffn alone, and the vast majority of them are utter crap. It's honestly the reason I started writing fanfiction -- after so many years, it was simply too hard to find something that I enjoyed reading. So I started writing my own.

Anyways, thanks again for your comments. It's nice to have someone interested enough to take the time to give thought-out input. I don't have a beta, by the way, and I really don't have time for one. Like I said, I'm writing in my spare time and I don't want to make the process any slower than it already is. It would be different if there was any prospect of actually publishing my work and maybe getting a paycheck for it, but this is ‘just' fanfiction; it gets posted right next to all the Ginny-angst songfics.

Thanks again!

Note, haven't read any of it yet, might do so later when I have some time, but I have a question from this bit of the summary. How/why would Harry learn to use the dark side rather than the light side from a Jedi Holocron?

Also as a side note, I'm not too big a fan of questions in summaries. This one isn't really offputting like some are(like the ones where the summary is literally just a bunch of questions in a row followed by a bunch of !character descriptors), but some people will skip past summaries with questions out of hand because it makes them associate your fic with the ones with the really terrible question summaries so you might want to change it.

*** Thanks for the comment. I hope you like the story if you get around to reading it.

I see what you're saying with the summary. Instead of the question, how's this: "Find out what happens when young Harry brings his Jedi Holocron with him to Hogwarts."

As for the Dark Side bit, it isn't meant to imply that Harry would be learning to use the Dark Side from the Holocron, but rather that the temptation and danger of the Dark Side might be a concern, just as it is for all Jedi. But I can see how that might not be clear from how it's worded. How about replacing "Do not underestimate the power of the Dark Side..." with "The Force is strong with this one, but a Jedi must always be wary of the power of the Dark Side..."? How does that sound?

Any suggestions?

Or maybe something like this

Lost in a vast, underground system of caves, seven-year-old Harry Potter stumbles upon a glowing, blue cube that has lain forgotten in the darkness for thousands of years. While Harry embarks on his journey to Hogwarts with the Jedi Holocron in tow he must withstand the temptation of the dark side.

I'm not great at summaries either, maybe someone else can chime in with something better.

Also sort of related I was unsure if dark side was a proper noun or not so I looked it up and it isn't according to this source.

#+begin_quote
  The Force

  While "the Force" is a proper noun and therefore must be capitalized, the light and dark sides of the Force are not capitalized in the vast majority of official sources. Therefore, they must not be capitalized on Wookieepedia. For example: "Anakin Skywalker fell to the dark side," not "...to the Dark Side."

***** Thanks for the suggestions. I like "Harry embarks on his journey to Hogwarts with the Jedi Holocron in tow." I might go with that.

But I'm not a fan of, "he must withstand the temptation of the dark side." I want to leave it a little more ambiguous than that. Will Harry be tempted to the dark side? Is Voldemort somehow in touch with the dark side? Is it some one else? You've got to read to find out.

Also, I did a little searching on the proper capitalization of 'dark side,' and while you're correct that it is /not/ to be capitalized, that hasn't always been the case. Apparently the official sources flopped back and forth for a while. You can read more about it here: [[https://starwnerd.wordpress.com/2013/12/11/the-capitalization-status-of-the-dark-side-revenge-of-infinata/]]

I guess I'll need to go through my chapters and look for proper capitalization now...

** The Dursleys are pretty ridiculous in their cruelty in this story. Are you going to have ANY payoff for their behavior or is it simply another case of taking canon abuse to hyperbole because you like it? If you're not having a payoff it's a waste of all our time. Even JK skipped most of it.

I swear, it's like some authors get off on torturing Harry.

*** Thanks for sharing your thoughts. I actually addressed this point in the forums I set up on ffn. If you're interested in what else I've got to say, there's a link in my ffn profile. However, I'll copy my thoughts about how to write the Dursleys here for your reference:

So, I've had a few people comment about the Dursleys - about how they were acting, or not acting, so I thought this might deserve to be posted here.

I think that writing an accurate portrayal of the Dursleys is always going to be problematic for fanfiction authors because I think JKR herself was inconsistent with how she portrayed them. At the start of the series, she was basically writing Harry as Cinderella, thus he needed to live with wicked relatives before he went off on his fairy-tale adventure. But not too wicked, because she was writing a children's story after all. But then the later books grew more serious, less fantastical, and more like the real world. However, that left an incongruency with regard to the Dursleys. Real-world people that would make their prepubescent nephew sleep in a cupboard and use him as a kitchen slave would probably also be rather physically abusive to him on a regular basis. At least that's how I see it. But JKR didn't write it that way. They're horrible people, but not too horrible. So how do you write them accurately? What do we do with someone like Aunt Petunia who once took a swing at Harry's head with a frying pan? If you're willing to mock your lonely, orphaned nephew with Christmas gifts such as: a 50 pence-piece, a toothpick, and a single tissue, what else would you do to him by way of mockery? That depends - what type of story are you writing? A lighthearted, fairy-tale adventure ala the early books? Or a serious, World War II/Holocaust, socio-political allegory like the later books try to be?

By shifting genres in the middle of the series, JKR opened up a lot of moral questions about the actions taken by her characters, and it's not just limited to the Dursleys. Wormtail and Dumbledore also come to mind as characters that are affected by JKR's genre shift. Ron's pet rat turning out to be a villain is a great plot point for a fairy tale. It's also really, really creepy for a more serious story to have a grown man sleeping in the same room as a bunch of schoolboys. Dumbledore leaving Harry in a basket on the doorstep? It can be either a classic fairy tale beginning, or a criminal act of neglect, depending on your genre.

So, I think that leaves us with a wide variety of ways to interpret the Dursleys as well as other characters and what they would or would not do. And that's why they're portrayed so differently in different fanfics.

At least that's my two cents.

** I have to agree with my fellow commenters that the Dursleys are caricatures. And i think Harrys training with the stick is a bit rushed. On the other hand i like the idea and voice of the Holocron and will keep reading. Im looking forward to see how you write about Harrys time in Hogwarts !

*** Thanks for sharing your thoughts. I think I've already posted enough about the Dursleys in this thread. If that's not enough to convince you, /c'est la vie./ I'm not sure how Harry's training with the stick is rushed, the first scene takes place almost eight months after Harry finds the Holocron. Obi-Wan had Luke practicing with his lightsaber against the training remote in a matter of days or less. Or maybe you were talking about pacing?

Anyways, I'm glad you've enjoyed it enough so far to keep reading. Thanks again!
