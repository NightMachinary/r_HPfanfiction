** Sorry, from her Tumblr:

"So a few of you may have already noticed, and others will notice eventually, that the fics on my ff.net account are all gone. This is not a mistake or anything, I've just finally taken them down.

I got another PM yesterday, and the message basically boiled down to how I should let and even expect people to take my stories and continue them just because I haven't updated in a long time. That because they haven't been updated in years, I should stop ‘acting like I'm going to still work on them'. They specify that they don't write but they think it's funny and because it's the internet, letting people take my stories like that should be fine. They never come right out and say the word ‘plagiarism' but that's what this pretty much is. They tell me it's been several years since last update for my older fics (even though I just updated Dead Man Walking not a month ago??), and that “at least [people who take my stories to write themselves] like it enough that they thought they could do it justice while giving you credit for your few thousand words stories after you've given up on writing anything else”.

I don't know if you can call C'est La Vie's nine chapters (a total of 107884 words) ‘a few'. Likewise with Raison d'Etre at twelve chapters and 95816 words or Swinging Pendulum with five chapters and 84793 words. I could go on. But the point is, people don't give me credit. There's been a few people who've messaged me to ask if they can borrow an idea and credit me for it but the plot of their fic will be their own, and I have always said yes. Someone even asked to adopt Cookie Predictions and continue it, and because it was so open-ended but I didn't have plans to continue myself, I also said yes so long as they credit me for the original piece. So I don't think I'm being totally unreasonable or whatever. But mostly, whenever I get word of someone ‘writing' a fic that's ‘inspired' by one of my fics, they don't message me about it, and three-quarters of their fic is basically a word-for-word copy of my fic. Sometimes, they don't even mention my name or my fic, they just write something like ‘inspired by a fic I read'. Maybe other people are okay with that but I'm not. Maybe that makes me a totally unfair bitch but... I really don't give a damn.

I won't say who sent me the message because I know at least a few of you will go over there and give them a strongly worded punch in the face, and while that's appreciated, I don't want to start a huge shitstorm, and then the person who messaged me in the first place will tell me about how they're suicidal now, etc, etc. I've had this happen to me more than once.

I didn't just come here to complain even if it may seem like it so far. I just wanted to explain why my ff.net account is now empty. The message I got felt pretty condescending and entitled to me and it was just the last straw. If you've followed me long-term, you'll knows stuff like this has happened to me multiple times before. This time wasn't even the worse time obviously, it's probably better than getting a message from one of my followers about how they found a fic that's been plagiarized from mine. But unfortunately, this particular sender caught me at a bad time. I had a pretty long day at school yesterday, and then some personal family matters cropped up suddenly in the evening that still haven't been resolved, and I hadn't slept in thirty-six+ hours before that, so I was feeling pretty shitty when I got that message late at night when I was just sitting down for a break, and it just made me feel even shittier.

Fanfiction is one of the few things that actually makes me happy. It's not like I have a horrible life or anything, I think I'm pretty lucky overall, but in general, I'm just not a very happy person, and depression is a problem for me from time to time. Fanfiction - writing it, reading it - makes me happy, and maybe you'll think that's pathetic and dumb, I know some people who don't think very highly of it, but it works for me. So whenever something like this happens - plagiarism or the implication that plagiarizing my work is perfectly okay and I shouldn't be upset about it - that upsets me.

It's happened several times on ff.net, which is why I'm leaving it. I've said it a few times before, that I might do that, but usually I talk myself out of it because I try to sleep on it first instead of making a rash decision and just deleting my fics from there right away, and that normally works to change my mind and leave them, but I slept a couple hours on this, I woke up, and I still feel as shitty as I did last night. So. Yeah. They're gone.

Most will still be up on AO3 (I think Rd'E, Take a Stand, All the World's a Stage, Give It a Year, Ghost, When a Demon Comes to Call, and For Whom the Bell Tolls aren't on there - I will eventually crosspost them when I have time) but I know some people prefer reading them on ff.net. Solution - don't read my fics again, or hop over to AO3 and read them. Imo, it's a better site than ff.net. Any future messages about how you think I'm being unfair to you or that I'm being too sensitive or too dramatic or whatever and that I'm completely overreacting will be ignored and deleted. You're entitled to your own opinions, just as I'm entitled to mine, and this is what I've decided.

No doubt, someone somewhere will take the opportunity to plagiarize me again, maybe thinking that I won't notice them posting on ff.net now that I don't post there anymore. Yeah, there's a good chance I might not catch you, and if I don't know, I can't do anything about it. My tumblr/fic followers might miss it too, although they're very good about informing me when they do catch it and backing me up when they can. Point is, you might get away with it. Kudos to you. Your plagiarizing abilities are top notch. Your writing on the other hand - not so much. If you're okay with that, as some people are, there's nothing I can do about it.

To the people who have followed my fics on ff.net and encouraged me with reviews along the way, thank you for the support and I apologize if it's more difficult for you now to have to go to AO3 if you still want to read them, I know that site's not for everybody.

That's basically all I have to say. It turned out more long-winded than I planned. If you actually made it through all of it though, I hope you'll understand my point of view on this matter. If you don't like the fact that my updates only come when I feel like writing it, and my muse has the attention span of a goldfish, there's a very easy solution to that too - don't read my fics. You're not paying me so I have zero obligation to cater to what you want. First and foremost, I write for my own enjoyment, not yours."

*** Well, as much as I want to say “she overreacted”, I know that people can be a real pain in the arse sometimes and if the messages she is talking about are something she'd really been getting then they deserve her giving them the short end of the stick.

Because really, self-entitlement, ugh. If you don't write then you don't write self-entitled messages to those who do write, regardless of what your opinion about their work schedule or writing efficiency actually is.

And that's that.

**** I don't approve of the harassment, but her thoughts are very entitled. This is fanfiction, if someone wants to continue your fic they're free to do so. Abandoned or not, it doesn't matter.

***** I meant that the messages she'd been getting are self-entitled, actually. Because if they actually were writing anything they could just do that, and if they wanted to adopt her story they could simply message her about it (and even if they did not know if she'd be for it, they hadn't tried at all); but to get onto someone's case for taking time to write when the person doing it doesn't write at all, that's just being an immature and self-entitled arse.

So really, /if/ her message is self-entitled they only have themselves to blame for it.

** Is the author ever planning to go back and edit the fourth chapter of Dead Man Walking, and change everything from (unreadable) present tense to past tense? linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1037432/chapters/2069217]])

  Kreacher goes back to save his master, and Regulus survives but his near-death-by-Inferi puts him into a coma for the next sixteen years. When he wakes, well, the world is not so different. Voldemort is still at large, and the Ministry is still inept. His brother's got a godson now though, so it's only natural for Regulus to keep an eye on young Harry as well.

** I checked the profile, and I guess they moved their stories to AO3.
