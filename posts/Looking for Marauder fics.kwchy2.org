Just finished reading All the Young Dudes, which I loved. Does anybody have any other good marauder fics, preferably which are set when they are all at Hogwarts, and maybe a particular focus on Sirius and wolfstar? Thank you!


** We have an ATYD discord and the fics that are generally recommended there if you're looking for Wolfstar are

linkao3(Sweater Weather by Lumosinlove) linkao3(Dress Up in You by MissKingBean89) linkao3(Text Talk by merlywhirls)

They're all muggle AUs but have good Wolfstar plotlines.

If your looking for more long Marauder fics then linkffn(The Life and Times by Jewels5) is very good! Not Wolfstar but a nice Marauders story.

I've yet to find a proper Marauders story on par with ATYD. But there's a few oneshots stories by Marie Kavanagh, LullabyKnell and JanuaryGrey that are worth looking at. They all write marauder era stories which are very good!!! Just not "boys go to Hogwarts" stories ðŸ˜Š

  Remus works for the Gryffindor Lions as a physical trainer, and has been half in love with Sirius Black, the Lions' heartthrob captain, for a while now, but he never expected Sirius to return the feelings. Read if you like cute nicknames, slow burn, and pining. Yep. That's it.There's some nice OC's of mine in here, too, please don't take them, thanks!(If you want to see more of this universe, check out 12 Days of Ficmas 2020 in my listed works. These characters also appear (in a very situations) in my work Relic Keel, along with some new OCs)

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise! PLEASE DO NOT COPY TO WATTPAD. SERIOUSLY, WHY??

  Sirius is in boarding school, Remus is in hospital, and they don't know each other until Sirius texts the wrong number.
