Hey guys I'm writing a dark Harry AU and I need some advice on the plot. I suppose you could call it a beta but it'll only be a one time thing and I don't need help editing grammar or anything like that. I just need someone I can bounce ideas off of.

If anyone is interested here's the link. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23458750/chapters/56234929]]


** I don't want to sound rude but you do need a beta for your grammar and sentence construction. The words you've chosen make a few sentences feel unnatural to read, a lot of it doesn't make sense and unnecessary words are very common. It doesn't flow very well and makes it very difficult to read. I honestly couldn't get past your nursery scene.

Just as an example, taking your first paragraph

#+begin_quote
  Darkness dominated the night. The moon, usually above in the sky illuminating everything was absent. Even the stars, with their small brightness, were missing making everything appear more sinister and eerie. Birds that looked so innocent and harmless during the day appeared almost monstrous in the darkness. Small critters scampering around the ground in search of food could be easily mistaken for snakes or equally undesirable creatures. Not a sound was made, especially not when no one dared go outside, preferring the comfort of their warm homes. As with anything, of course, there was one exception.
#+end_quote

Dominated doesn't give off the feeling you're trying to invoke in that context. "Usually above in the sky" and "small brightness" aren't correct phrases to use. "snakes or equally undesirable creatures" feels wrong. Those are just a few examples.

Don't get discouraged though, good writing comes with time, and I'm sure you'll get there, but for now, you could use an interested beta to help you out.
