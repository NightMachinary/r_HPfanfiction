***** The Dark Lord stood in shadow, surveying the destruction before him with Mountain Dew Code Red colored eyes. The little house was in ruins. Tiny shards of shattered glass littered the ground beneath the splintered timbers and crumbling bricks that had once made up the little cottage at the end of Watercress Lane. Dust rose into the sky in great pillars, rising from the rubble into the starless, moonlight sky, cutting through the dark like thick, white fingers.

The inhabitant lay dead in the middle, her large blue eyes frozen permanently in wide, abject terror.

Voldemort smiled a thin-lipped, baleful smile. Delivering justice was always satisfying. Carole was beautiful, funny, and she had an affinity for pulling the entrails from screaming Muggle children. The Dark Lord had been smitten immediately. Carole hadn't been like other women, at least until she was. The last time he'd seen her living, she had tossed him into the Friend Zone without so much as a second thought and had starting going out with some Beta, misogynistic asshole who had no idea how to treat a lady. Slutty bitch.

A few more moments passed as Voldemort surveyed the destruction before he lifted a fingerless gloved hand to stroke the sleek, green head of the large snake that had reared at his side. "/My dear,/" he hissed gently. Nagini was the only female who had never hurt him. "/I believe our work here is done./"

He lifted his wand, pointing it to the hazy sky above the remains of Whore Carole's little cottage and tipped his pinstriped fedora. "/M'orsmordre./"

** It's always strange and jarring when the author is doing well but then inserts their interests. You were doing great, why did you have to fuck it up?! I don't need five paragraphs about Hermione's favorite book/song which is "coincidentally" the same as yours. I don't need every chapter to include references to her church going and music lessons. I don't buy that she routinely likes to dance to 80's music when your profile states your love for the movie Flashdance.

It's common for fics to spend too much words on detailed outfit explanations. I ran into one fic that avoided that problem until one particular scene. They spent several paragraphs describing Ron's underpants-how his mum made them, the spots that were wearing thin, what color thread she used, his favorite memories in them, on and on. I think it was supposed to be a deep, reflective moment for Ron? But it was really just weird. I don't need a microscope view of his pants moments before he loses his virginity.

I read one where Snape introduced his House to Star Wars, Settlers of Catan, and taught them to dance. He danced with Hermione in the Slytherin common room and I'm 99% certain a disco ball was involved. Of course, he was fine with his students getting wasted and high on the dance floor.

  I'm not sure I find a dancing Snape a believable Snape. I think he's transforming and adapting to the new situation too fast and behaving out of character IMHO.

  I believe that a person such as Snape would have a much harder time accepting Hermione as his apprentice, or indeed, just accepting her anywhere near him for that matter. *Somehow I feel he should be more conflicted and torn apart by inner struggles, but my main concern remains his almost effortless transition from tortured soul to disco dancing...* (emphasis mine) I actually had to scroll back up and see if the story was listed under the theme "humor" ;)

  Anyway, that's just my initial reaction to the chapter, perhaps you have something dark, gloomy and more Snape-like planned ahead :)

***** I'd think Star Wars would strike a chord with a number of the wizards. It's basically a fantasy story with what is basically a wizard orphan learning about magic and saving the world from a Dark Lord. All set in a fantastic world.

Though to be honest, I think any Hollywood Blockbuster would impress the wizards, since they lack movies. Movies crafted to hit your emotions, with cuts, scripts, and music fit to purpose, aimed at an audience much more familiar with all the tropes and competitions, but now shown to people new to all of that? That's bound to have a big impact.

Wizards have music, wizards have board games, but movies? That's new, and grand. And contrary to modern times, Video games 20 years ago were not that impressive. Movies though... tear jerkes, action movies, comedies... I doubt many wizards would be immune to their lure.

** I read a fic once where Harry had loads of muggle friends and went clubbing with them alot in summer.

He had photos of them on his bedroom wall along with the lyrics to a song they wrote together.

It was several lines long and was basically just different variations of the phrase "We are a bunch of slutty sluts."

Pretty good impression of most of the pop music, I must say.

** Random Rapey!Dumbledore.

I cannot, I repeat cannot, continue a fic after this happens, and I often chug through some simply /horrendous/ material just to be able to say I did it (reading 50 Shades of Grey was done for the exact purpose of shock value.)

But this... oh my god. I was reading a perfectly normal, long bash fic, nothing out of the ordinary for that genre (you know standard evil!Dumbles) but randomly, halfway through the fic, he goes around and rapes/impregnates every female member of the Order.

That little red x button got a lot of action that day.

Ugh. No.

#+begin_quote
  Harry takes charge of his fate and the war. He manipulates the wizarding world with revolts, scams and his own vast wealth, but even the best laid plans go awry. His mistake costs him more than he bargains for. Regardless, he is committed to making his crazy plan work. Begins after GoF - Some Dumbledore bashing.

It turned what was a hilariously earnest Gary Stu tale into the author's coming out party as an unrepentant MRA douchenozzle.

** I can't remember the exact name, something about Golden Nuggets, but at random points throughout the fic the author had the young girls of Hogwarts (of all ages) basically grope/rip the clothes off Harry whenever they felt like it. This all came to a point when all of a sudden Harry is tied down to his bed naked, and is basically raped/masturbated raw against his will several times by a dozen girls of various ages (all students though).

Then literally two paragraphs later the incident is never mentioned again and all is well.

It's such a shame that the author is a pedophile because the fic was actually quite interesting aside from those instances of what basically amounted to the author's sick child fantasies.
