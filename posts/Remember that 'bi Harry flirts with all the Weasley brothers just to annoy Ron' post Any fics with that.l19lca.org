For those who don't recall, there was a tumblr post from awhile back where a bi Harry was like "I love Ginny and all, but damn if Bill was single, I'd tap that." and Ron groans, then the joke gets taken further as Harry extends his flirtations through the whole family, who play along because grumpy Ron is funny. Anyone got any fics beyond the one below that do that sort of thing? Have Harry flirt through the whole Weasley clan?

At a pinch, I'll take a broadly flirty-confident Harry, even without the Weasley brothers thing.

As always, all relationships/pairings okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. Basically, anything goes. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

  "Oy, stop it, Harry!"Harry blinked at him, not as innocent as he seemingly wanted to appear, because well, Ron was his best friend. He knew that expression all too well. "What is it with you and flirting with my family?"

Harry is gay and full of sass. No smut as far as I can recall, just Harry being thirsty as hell.

  Remember Goblet of Fire? What would happen if Harry took the filter off his mouth and actually said what he's thinking? Bad things, probably. But it'll be fun as hell. My go at the Intelligent!Harry, Smart alec!Harry situation.
