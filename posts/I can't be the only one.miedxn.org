I found a time loop tomarry fic on ao3(summary: harry keeps reliving the day he entered the chamber of secrets and he's getting sick of it,) now unfortunately this only had two chapters, was unfinished, and stopped updating in February of 2020 -14 months ago as of right now- I can't find anything like it on ao3, I've long since stopped using wattpad, and I have no idea how the other fanfic websites work so if you've read any fanfics with this plot(harry relives the chamber of secrets over and over, tomarry is preferred but gen or other M/M pairings are fine) please put them down in the comments, I also don't mind if they're unfinished, I'm desperate for this headcanon to be fulfilled!

- thank you in advance if you do put in any reccs :) -


** And if even if your fanfic doesn't meet all my requirements still comment them, I'm always open to new fic ideas/headcannons and I don't judge so any and all fics that fit the 'harry relives the chamber of secrets' bill will always be welcomed :)!

** There's a fic, I think a longer one, on AO3 that is kind of like that, but Tom keeps dying, and Harry is like a ghost? I haven't gotten around to reading it as my reading queue is pretty big.
