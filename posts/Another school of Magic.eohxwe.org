I'm looking for fanfictions about Harry (or another character) at a different School of magic. Preferably post-GoF but open to younger if well written. 100k+ and completed. A Second Chance at Life by Miranda Flairgold is a great example except it is abandoned.

No retelling of Canon events. I get so bored with that.


** My personal favourite of these fics is When A Veela Cries. Depressing as fuck in the beginning, but it grows into that sort of deliciously hopeful melancholy that I adore in a story like this. And the OCs at Durmstrang are lovely.
