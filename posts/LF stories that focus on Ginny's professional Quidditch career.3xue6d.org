What is says in the title. Either canon-compliant or AU is fine, but should have a strong focus on Ginny.

I read what little is written of linkffn(The Changing Game by Persephone21), which was very good for all of two chapters before it was abandoned. Really liked Ginny's characterization in it, none of the usual fanon bullshit that ruins stories by making every female character shy and insecure. If possible, I would like more stories in that vein.

*** This story is such mushy nonsense, lol. I guess there is a very loose focus on Quidditch but c'mon.
