It's called Bound and Blinded: The ballad of Hannah Abbott.

It mainly focuses on Hannah during her time in the repopulation program. With some minor dramione. I'm really enjoying it so far.


** Just read Manacled yesterday, so no I will not be reading this so soon because I'm still hurt and trying to heal.

But thanks for the rec, I might give it a go. Is it really dark too? Because Manacled kind of traumatized me with the description of deaths and the corpses of people we know :(

  I always see ppl mention Manacled and how amazing it is and want to read it but know full well I can't handle it. I've seen the warnings from other readers...I can't if there's rape and sexual abuse. Oh well, would rather have peace of mind.

**** It was REALLY good but I definitely wish there were parts of it I didn't read because I was literally staring at my phone shellshocked ðŸ˜­

The ending made me want to scream and cry but also the story itself is so tragic and heartbreaking.
