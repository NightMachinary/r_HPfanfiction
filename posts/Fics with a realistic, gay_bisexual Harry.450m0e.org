Please no "everyone is gay", that's just obnoxious.


** Here are a couple you might try, both explicit. They're ship fics, so if you're looking for gay/bi Harry + plotty fic, these might not be for you. But they're good.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/69622][Sadness of Eros]] by loupgarou1750 (Harry/Snape, Harry/Ginny) This posits Harry as more gay than bi, basically lying to himself and getting his needs met on the side. It starts with a glory hole scene, so heads-up for graphic description of dicks. Harry's married, which adds to his self-denial, and because he can't be honest with himself, he behaves badly to both Ginny and Snape. The fic is raw and often very funny, and it's a blunt look at the potential consequences of trying to suppress one's sexual identity. The ending is a little unsatisfying, as it was written to a deadline, but the fic makes it worthwhile anyway.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/515182][Mustard Seed]] by rinsbane. It's locked to AO3, so you have to be a member of the archive to see it.

(Harry/Percy, Harry/Ron/Hermione) This fic pulls off a neat trick of starting in Harry's POV and going backwards in time, then switching to Percy's POV and going forwards to the original starting point and just beyond. It was written before the last book, so its reference to character deaths and other details aren't entirely canon-compliant. It's harsh and a bit poignant, and Harry's more worn-down and disillusioned than we see in canon. Most of the fic takes place in Egypt, where Harry and Percy both work for the goblins, and it's very hot and gritty and erotic and slightly kinky.

Neither of these fics is sentimental about sex, but they do make the emotional connections matter.

Re: "everyone is gay" - I don't consider it obnoxious - there are a lot worse things in fic than that, IMO - but it doesn't really work for me. However, I've heard other LGBT readers talk about it, and they /know/ it's fantasy, but it's such a relief to imagine a world in which we're not merely visible, we're everywhere and LGBT romance is as commonplace as straight people in the real world. It's self-indulgent, sure, but fanfic is the very definition of escapist pleasure, so it seems a decent playground in which to re-imagine an already fictional universe.

*** Huh, that's interesting. Did I get downvoted because someone here doesn't like the idea of gay/bi Harry, or because they don't like the fics? If it's the latter, I'd still be curious to know what they thought of the stories, since it's hard to predict what other readers consider "realistic."

If it's just because of the pairings, never mind, because ship hate never leads anywhere good.

*** Seconding this! Great fic, very realistic in my opinion.

linkao3(879852) should work, if you link to Archive of our own you have to use linkao3. Also, the number in the link you used is enough, you don't need the whole link.

** linkffn(4776976) has a very realistic Drarry with amazing concepts, but also has SSHG as the other lead pairing, with the story being mostly about Hermione and Harry as Pure Adults.

** You should try some of Vorabiza's stuff. I like Secrets and Malfoy Flavor best, but those are epic length. Maybe Lockdown or Take Advantage of Me if you want something shorter. Sorry, no bot links, author doesn't use any of those sites. But the name is unique enough to google.

** Only two stories in my memory that fit your request and are good enough to be recommended:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][/The Sacrifices Arc/]] (W^{T} : 3,075,741; Complete) (Harry\Draco);
- maybe also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6685668/1/A-Switched-Chance][/A Switched Chance/]] (116,174 WL, WiP) (genderbent!Harry) --- depending on your views on what can be considered “gay”. Here he [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdLawOfGenderBending][magically starts fancying boys]] after getting stuck in a girl's body.

Oh, and I'd recommend staying away from Harry\Voldemort stories, since all of them I've seen so far had terribly out-of-character portrayals.
