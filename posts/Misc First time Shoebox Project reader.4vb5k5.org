So I'm trying to read the Shoebox Project for the first (I know I'm really late to the game), But I do not know if I have all the chapters since the zip link is broken. I have 26 chapters, not including part b or the extra snippets.


** You should have: 1-17, 17 1/2, 18, 18 1/2, 19-20, 21a/b, 22-24, 25a/b, 26, and some extras.
