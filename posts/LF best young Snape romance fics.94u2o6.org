time travel or real-time (mauraders' era) both fine. bonus for long fics. bonus for SS/LE or SS/HG.


** Mmmmm.... define "young?" After Hogwarts era, like early twenties, is still pretty young in my book, mostly because I'm older than them at this point, but maybe that's not what you're looking for? Anyway, here's what I got, it's all SS/LE because that's my beloved ship:

Come Once Again and Love Me linkao3(13844247) is an absolute classic; it's time-travel but deftly done and has some really beautiful, fun moments. Very much a Hogwarts-era romance. Very very complete and has been for years, so you've probably read it.

The Path Not Tread linkao3(5803846) is very fun and goes in-depth with all the Marauders during their time at Hogwarts without bashing them, exactly; it takes a while to get moving but the depth of the character worth is worth it imho, even though the plot isn't action-packed. A nice looooooong lazy read for a sunday afternoon! WIP

A dealer, not a death eater linkao3(14046060) is an absolute delight, and currently updating a breakneck pace. Instead of becoming a Death Eater, Severus becomes a illegal potions dealer after he graduated (along with his apprenticeship); he and Lily are together but that doesn't mean the war isn't happening all around them. The plot is very twisty and it's VERY dark in bits; I absolutely love it. WIP

I have a special place in my heart for The Long Road Home linkffn(6613973) since Penelope started writing it right as I started writing my own Snape / Lily fic, and she recently started back up with it as well (like, 3-chapters-a-week got back into it--her pace is astonishing). It kicks off in 1981 so it might be later than you're looking for but I absolutely love how this goes. WIP

And I'm going to just sneak my own Puzzle linkao3(11622306) and seventeen moons linkao3(15042299) in there. Puzzle is a looooooong dark AU of the soul about what might have transpired if Snape could have found Pettigrew and gone to Godric's Hollow before the Dark Lord did; it's very much a romance and very much a tragedy, kicking off in 1983. seventeen moons is a Hogwarts-era oneshot about what might have happened if Remus had bitten Severus in the Shack when he was 15; it's told month-by-month with scenes from before or after each full moon.

  Severus wakes up in the afterlife expecting something rather different than being almost-seventeen again. But wait - Lily's come back, too - from 1981? Perhaps it's a second chance... but for what?

#+begin_quote
  Sometimes all that's needed for enormous differences is a small change, as small as the order of a few sentences in a heated fight. Lily Evans unconsciously makes one such change while arguing with her best friend, and the magnitude of consequences her actions cause hold the potential to reshape not only herself and the people around her, but their world's very future. A What-if AU that explores the questions of how much we know ourselves, how much we're truly influenced by our surroundings and how much we do so in turn, whether unexpected consequences arising from the choices we make are our responsibility, and ultimately, whether truth is truly an objective axiom of existence, or only what we make of it.

  It should've been simple: Severus falls for Lily, Lily falls for Severus, and the pair live happily ever after. Instead, Voldemort is rising, and the Ministry is corrupt. With her options in the wizarding world curtailed, Lily quickly aligns herself with the Order of the Phoenix, whilst boyfriend Severus remains deliberately apolitical. After all, as a full citizen, he's got rather more to lose. With Lily forbidden from earning, he's keeping them both, with all of his spare time eaten up by his apprenticeship and his casual hours behind the bar at the Three Broomsticks. Not to mention his little side-hobby. Avoiding Azkaban. Touting illegal potions carries a rather harsh sentence, you see...

  “The scar is small, at least,” Pomfrey says, pulling the bandage snug around the cleaned wound. There's a pity in her voice that makes Severus want to throw up again. “It will be easily covered.”Dumbledore catches him inspecting it, as if mesmerized. “You are lucky to have survived at all,” the Headmaster says.Severus does not say I don't feel very lucky because it is stupid and obvious. Instead, he says unsteadily, “I want to press charges, sir.”Pomfrey stills, tightening the bandage to the point of discomfort.“Remus Lupin would be executed,” Dumbledore says. “The Ministry takes a dim view of werewolves who infect other wizards.”

*** Can I just say that Puzzle was amazing and had me on the edge of my seat for weeks toward the end. What a fabulous, unique concept with such well written characters. I also just read Seventeen Moons and that was delightful as well! I loved the progression.

Finally, A Dealer Not a Death Eater was such an awesome suggestion! I've been reading it nonstop over the last couple of days. It's so refreshing to see good Snily still being written. I have not checked out The Long Road Home yet but it's on my list.

**** Thank you so much! It's awesome to know that newcomers are still discovering it even though I've moved on to less "serious" fic. (Bad Oracle is in no way serious. The google doc is just titled "THE TRASHPILE.")

And A Dealer Not a Death Eater is just so delightfully MADCAP and fails to fall into so many of the pitfalls that I think Snape / Lily tends to fall into. It doesn't overexplain how they ended up together, it doesn't try to make their life together look rosy or make either of them look like Tragic Heroes who have been Completely Wronged, they don't have a deep soul connection--they have problems like any other couple. And the way the war moves on without them is kind of horribly chilling. And while it's not all that interested in the Marauders, it also doesn't go out of its way to bash them.

The Long Road Home is really charming because--though it is slow-moving--it takes everyone's point of view and treats it with equal weight.

Do you have any favorite things for this ship that I've missed? I'm always hungry for new stuff! (Ananke is another old favorite, but it *is* older.)

***** Ananke is awesome- that fic taught me to never get up on the "abandoned" ones. For a while I was really into Snape relives his life fics (like Come Once Again and Love Me). Probably the most well known and best is linkffn(The Moment it Began by sindhe). Other Snily fics I like are:

linkffn(A Dream Carved in Stone by diadelphous)

linkffn(obscura nox animae by heatherlly) which has a really unique premise.

** Only 130k words, and I'm pretty sure it is abandoned, but "A Prince Rising" was the one SS fic that I actually liked. Set in the marauders era.

  Sixteen-year-old Severus leaves Hogwarts to attend school in the U.S., and possibly pursue a new life. But what of the growing darkness back home that threatens Lily and all he's ever known? (This story is an AU and does not follow HP canon!)

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15420894][making sure the boy who lives actually does]] is my current obsession now.

Summary: Harry wants to meet his parents, Draco wants to save his father and Hermione just wants to keep them alive. When this unexpected trio is shot back through time they are unaware of just how much their actions are reshaping the future and due to jealousy, lust and betrayal the boy who lived may not exist in the future.

It's a young SS/HG so far and i can't get enough.
