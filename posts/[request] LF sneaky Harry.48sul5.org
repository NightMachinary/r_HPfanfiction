I've been re-reading linkffn(5554780) and normally Slytherin Harry means either a sort of re-telling of canon with him being sorted into Slytherin or he becomes darker & independant and there is a lot of Light bashing. Is there any good stories were he is being truly slytherin sneaky, maybe more of a canon divergence then a total AU?


** Being Slytherin =/= being sneaky. Being a Gryffindor with an invisibility cloak and a Marauder's Map on the other hand...

Anyways, if you're looking for an actual thief!Harry, there is linkffn(5199602)

*** I second thief at Hogwarts. It was pretty funny. There are only a couple fics that have actually made me laugh throughout and this was one of them. The others being Black Comedy, The Champion's Champion and the sorting hat in the Lie I've Lived.
