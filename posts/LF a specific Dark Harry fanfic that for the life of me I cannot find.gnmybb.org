:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I've recently read an amazing fanfic that I've been trying to find to read again and favourite, essentially Harry give Hermione a timeframe of 5 years (I think) but then after it passed forces the wizarding world to change by killing people and eventually Hermione figures out it is Harry causing it. If anybody can assist with this you'd be a legend


** I think it is /Dead Things/: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15695769]]

  Death isn't good for the soul and dead things can't die twice.Harry dies too many times to be fine. After the war he goes travelling; he and Tom Riddle always were too much alike for their own good.
