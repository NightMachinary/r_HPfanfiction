I just saw POA in Imax and I'm really craving some fics where Harry doesn't get on the Knight Bus or it doesn't show up at all.

Fics where he actually runs away properly would be great as well!

**** Greetings, everyone. I am new. (One second - let me get this spork out of the way.) My name is Katy, but you can call me the Penguin of Doom. (I'm laughing aloud.) As you can plainly see, my actions have no pattern whatsoever. That is why I have come here. To meet similarly patternless individuals, such as myself.

I am 13 - mature for my age, however! - and I enjoy watching Invader Zim with my girlfriend. (I am bisexual. Please approach this subject maturely.) It is our favorite television show, as it adequately displays stochastic manners of behavior such as we possess.

She behaves without order - of course - but I wish to meet more individuals of her and my kind. As the saying goes, "the more, the merrier."

Ah, it is to laugh. Anyway, I hope to make many friends here, so please comment freely.

Doom!

That is simply one of many examples of my random actions. Ha, ha. Fare thee well. I wish you much love and waffles.

Yours,

The Penguin of Doom.
