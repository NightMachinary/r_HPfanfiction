Plot: Apparently the Ministry is a racist, unfair institution. What a surprise. When Hermione Granger finds out that in order to get the internship of her dreams, she'll need to pay for the expensive tuition for them to, in their words ‚Äújustify letting a muggleborn into the Ministries /esteemed/ program,‚Äù she needs to find a job that will pay quick. Unfortunately, there aren't many jobs open to muggleborns. Fortunately, Hermione's morals were always looser than others.

‚Äã

Please pm me if you are interested, thanks! You're role would be to edit and add comments to the google doc that I have to see if I could elaborate or streamline it. This is my first fic, so this would be appreciated. Thanks!

So what does she resort to? Armed robbery? Identity theft through Polyjuice and Legilimency? Nigerian Scams?^{1} Don't just leave us hanging like that!

However, the Goblins, as you know, greedy Creatures, require a modest Fee to Redeem my Wealth...
