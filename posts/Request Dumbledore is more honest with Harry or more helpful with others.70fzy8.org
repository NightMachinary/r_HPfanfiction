Looking for stories where instead of keeping secrets Dumbledore is more trusting/honest with Harry.

I'd also like any stories where Dumbledore stops the bullying between the Marauders and Snape or help Remus more or whatever.

Any rating is fine, Would rather it be completed. But if a bunch of chapters I suppose it's fine.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash


** There is this linkffn(9824342) It is set shortly before Harrys first year.

In this world there is your stereotypical evil, manipulating, scheming Dumbledore. Then he dies.

Then a good and competent Dumbledore from another universe takes his place without anyone else knowing.

It is a fun read.

  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon). Year One Complete. Sequel will come - eventually.

*** I started reading it, I like it. I like the characterizations of everyone, but Dumbledore just seems like an oc with Dumbledore's name in my opinion. But I enjoy everyone else's characterization. Dumbledore seems a little too out of character, it's still enjoyable but kind of weird.

**** I personally think that this new and different AU Dumbledore is just the point of the story.

In Canon we had a mostly rather distant, non-invasive Dumbledore who just let things play out.

The starting point here is the very often done manipulative, maybe even evil Dumbledore.

So here is a possible 3rd view of a different Dumbledore who was more proactive.

**** But...that's the point? An AU Dumbledore is clearly going to be an entirely different character. That being said, I like it. He's closer to the Dumbledore I pictured when he was first introduced. Don't get me wrong, Dumbledore himself is one of my favorite characters but I do wish he had a more direct role in Harry's life.

  Hermione was told to stay away from him. Harry was warned not to let anyone get too close to him. She didn't listen and for that brief moment, she saw her first glimmer of hope that maybe, just maybe, that their future wasn't as hopeless as everyone made it out to be. AU. HP/HG Pairing.
