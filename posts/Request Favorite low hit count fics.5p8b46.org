Looking for fics that you read, or have written, that are not popular but you think are a good read. Looking for Harry and any female, complete or steadily updated. Thanks!


** When it comes to the disconnect between number of Favorites and story's quality, I would definitely pick "Children's Crusade", linkffn(6989327). It's an epilogue-compliant dimensional travel fic, in which Hermione from another dimension asked canon dimension for help in defeating Voldemort once more.

"Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water", linkffn(12076771), only has about 100 Favorites, but it's one of the extremely rare romantic Trio fics with a decent plot. Excellent fleet actions and Trio relationships.

"Not From Others", linkffn(11419408), only has 300 Favs so far, but is IMO the best Year 7 Hogwarts fic by a wide margin.

"The Dark Lord Never Died", linkffn(11773877), has less than 200 Favs, but has my favorite Ron/Hermione romance. The setting itself is very interesting, Lucius Malfoy is very well written, and the final battle is one of the best I've read among HP fanfics.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** Not sure what you'd consider not very popular... These are not obscure per-se, but IMHO have less recognition than they deserve.

Anything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/636397/lorien829][lorien829]]. Anything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5594536/Potato19][Potato19]].
