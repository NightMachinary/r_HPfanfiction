I once read an uncompleted fanfiction, Harry/Hermione, where harry lost his magic and slowly got abandoned by his friends. The order of the Phoenix is bad and trying to get his cloak of invisibility for some reason, while he hides in the muggle world with his muggle girlfriend, Emily or some similar name, which later appears to be part of the order. Does anyone have any idea what I'm talking about? Thanks in advance!


** It sounds a bit like “Behind Blue Eyes by elmembrila” linkffn(2095661), but not completely.

  In the final showdown with Voldemort, Harry loses his magical abilities, rendering him powerless. Alienating those around him, he attempts to assimilate to Muggle life, figure out the (a-little-too-close-to-home) reason behind his inabilities and, hopefully, regain his magic.
