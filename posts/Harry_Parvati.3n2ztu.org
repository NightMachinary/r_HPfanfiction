Looking for any stories where Harry and Parvati hit it off at the Yule ball and become a couple, any out there?


** I have one that I wrote a VERY long time ago - here it is!

  What if Parvati didn't want to go dancing with that boy from Beauxbatons, and dragged Harry onto the dance floor instead? A simple action leads them both into a much darker destiny filled with romance, danger and prophetic visions. AU, Complete.

I know two others of Harry/Parvati but they are after the yule ball:

  Harry, Parvati, and a way to hide from the world.

  Parvati had never even heard about Nargles until that day. And, yet, they were crucial to what happened.

There are some old HP Diversity LJ's and tumblrs that might help you find some fics.

** Not exclusively HP/PP, but actually seems more realistic as to how relationships and hormonal decisions happen at that age: linkffn(6896279)

  Harry's attraction to Parvati leads him to take his Yule Ball preparation much more seriously and his night is changed as a result. Includes an awesome Ron, an interesting Parvati and a drunk Katie Bell. Oh, and what's a Yule Ball fic without a little Fleur Delacour?
