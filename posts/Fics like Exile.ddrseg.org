** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): It's a major side plot and involves Draco Malfoy again. [[/spoiler][Basically, Bellatrix agreed to remove Draco from the war in exchange for information from her sister Narcissa. She bought Number 2 Privet Drive, forced Draco to live there (through some dark magic), take lawn mowing lesson from Vernon Dursley, and earn his lunch money by mowing lawns in the neighborhood.]] True to his Slytherin side, he has performed rather well.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.
