Or his own custom made replica.

Moody's eye seems extremely underused in fanfics considering how remarkable and uniquely powerful it is. I think it could be interesting to see someone's perspective as they put it to good use.

 

Harry is preferred, but any main character with the eye will do.

** I only know of one, and its an abandoned fic where Harry only had it in the Dark!Future, before getting sent to the past with a healed up body including both eyes.

*** There's I'm Still Here, which was mentioned by someone else here, and I feel like I've seen one other fic like that.

I seem to remember that Future!Harry was ridiculously mauled from battle... Peter-ish silver replacement flesh all over him.

But yeah, I haven't seen any that feature him actually using the eye.

*** IIRC, he never actually uses it though, right? He just has it stored away.

#+begin_quote
  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

** I don't know one where he uses Mad Eye's but in The Archaeologist Harry uses the Resurrection Stone as an eye. So that's cool. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19328290/chapters/45976822][the Archeologist]]
