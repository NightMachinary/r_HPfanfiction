Think about it: If Voldemort had won, he would have soon consolidated power in the Wizarding world. He would have then declared war upon the Muggle world. The muggles would have, in accordance with the doctirne of 'If i am going down, I am taking you down with me', start a nuclear war. And thus, if humanity does, in some minor way survive the nuclear holocaust, they would be thrown into a thousand, or even a million years of darkness.

Any thoughts?


** why would Voldemort bother with declaring an open war

when you can Just imperious the leaders and rule from the shadows

Just like he did with the ministry

** I dont think Voldemort would ever have declared war against muggles.

I rather see that the next step after Britain would be trying to take over all the other magical nations and to increase his control over the various magical races(like he did with the Goblins).

Afterwards with pretty much all magical governments under his control, there would be no need to declare war upon muggles, if he for some reason wanted to take over, he could do that within hours simply with the use of the imperius, but I rather see him being content with ruling his own magical kingdom and simply taking whatever he wants from muggles, without actually revealing himself, like in the books where his followers were still doing to Muggles whatever they wanted, but still allowed it to be covered up.

** I think you presume that Voldemort would have declared open war on the muggles. Why would he though? Better keep them ignorant, and realistically his ideology necessitates keeping them around to /some degree/.

Like many terrorist/authoritarian/governments, Voldemort needs an obvious other to point people outward and not inward. Muggleborns and squibs are a tiny, easily captured minority of the wizarding world. Voldemort would more likely keep the Muggles around (or prevent an absolute victory) so as to maintain the outward focus of his regime. Such methods have been employed countless times since time immemorial to justify the internal consolidation of power in states, and fits with Voldemort's modus operandi in the last three books.

**** A student of history will generally tell you this about leadership:

"Big changes are always resisted by the population. If you have done things right, people won't be sure you have done anything at all."

The best way to show this in HP is look at Harry and Remus discussion in DH:

#+begin_quote
  "But surely people realize what's going on?"

  "The coup has been smooth and virtually silent," said Lupin.

  "The official version of Scrimgeour's murder is that he resigned; he has been replaced by Pius Thicknesse, who is under the Imperius Curse."

  "Why didn't Voldemort declare himself Minister of Magic?" asked Ron.

  Lupin laughed.

  "He doesn't need to, Ron. Effectively, he is the Minister, but why should he sit behind a desk at the Ministry? His puppet, Thicknesse, is taking care of everyday business, leaving Voldemort free to extend his power beyond the Ministry."

  "Naturally many people have deduced what has happened: There has been such a dramatic change in Ministry policy in the last few days, and many are whispering that Voldemort must be behind it. However, that is the point: They whisper. They daren't confide in each other, not knowing whom to trust; they are scared to speak out, in case their suspicions are true and their families are targeted. Yes, Voldemort is playing a very clever game. Declaring himself might have provoked open rebellion: Remaining masked has created confusion, uncertainty, and fear."

  "And this dramatic change in Ministry policy," said Harry, "involves warning the Wizarding world against me instead of Voldemort?"

  "That's certainly a part of it," said Lupin, "and it is a masterstroke. Now that Dumbledore is dead, you-- the Boy Who Lived, were sure to be the symbol and rallying point for any resistance to Voldemort. But by suggesting that you had a hand in the old hat's death, Voldemort has not only set a price upon your head, but sown doubt and fear amongst many who would have defended you."

Just coming out and declaring himself God-King of the UK would have united everyone against him, possibly even some of the more neutral elements of the wizarding world. The key to changing societies/cultures is to never be overt about it. Voldemort always tries to maintain the veneer of normalcy following the coup. Arguably, his greatest miscalculation was launching an outright assault with his forces that created a target for the people to unite around during the Battle of Hogwarts. This was a figurative shock to the people, compelling the fence-sitters to rally and fight against the aberration to their society.

***** Well, it depends on the situation (as all things in life). You're right that big changes will cause resistance - but in many cases, big changes get /demanded/, or kind of cause themselves to happen. But it depends on your aims, and your position.

For instance, Voldemort's aim (to take full control of Wizarding Britain) is one that doesn't need to be in the open. Instead, he can /easily/ control it from behind the scenes. So for him, keeping it covert is the way to go.

However, other changes simply cannot be done in the shadows. We can see that some of the bigger changes in societies are caused when it comes /out/ of the shadows - for instance, the changes to France during the Revolution were incredibly profound, both socially and structurally - and such changes under the ancien regime would have been very, very difficult to achieve due to how it was structured, and couldn't have been done in secret either.

If we're putting it into HP terms, changes like increased freedom/power/representation for magical creatures, house elf liberation, or removing pureblood power would all be changes that I'd consider to need more openness than Voldemort's - you're not going to be able to covertly change wizarding society to accept werewolves as equals anytime soon.

The bigger difference, in my view, is that once it's out in the public, it's hard to have /controlled/ change.

** Those are a lot of assumptions there - for instance, that Voldemort would have been guaranteed to consolidate power in the Wizarding world at large (which is far larger than just wizarding britain), or that his power would be extreme enough to warrant that attack on the muggles even should he want to. Then, past that, we have no idea how such a war would go - and if a nuclear holocaust would even happen.

Basically it's a house of cards - it's easy enough to poke holes in at every point in time of your proposed timeline, enough of so that it'll heavily diminish your argument that Harry was the one great hero who stopped all of that basically single handedly.

Now, he likely is the greatest hero in Wizarding Britain's history - there'd have to be some major, major heroics in the past to somehow outdo him. But worldwide, Voldemort never really struck me as a threat. He doesn't have all /that/ many followers on a national scale, he couldn't win in a decade + the first time around, etc. Even if he were to become firmly in charge in Britain, that doesn't make it even all that likely that he could defeat even a small coalition of other Wizarding nations - if we go by canon, you'd expect there to essentially be a tailor made Western European coalition of France + the low countries + Italy + Iberia given who goes to Beauxbatons, and that /should/ be far larger than whatever Voldemort could muster from just Britain - even assuming he could send everything over.

** Harry is a hero bit not for those reasons. A hero means Harry had nobility and does it out of good, for betterment of society. This is not the case.

IMO I would classify Harry as a Tragic hero, his hamartia being his saving people nature. No I'm joking, he is a hero ignores emy attempts at being smart, I learned this from English Lit studying Macbeth.

However Voldemort would not have done that. I have a feeling he would have done something much more simpler.

He would have captured all magical governments and create one massive regime for magical. Imperious a lot of muggle higher ups in the government, change the value of Pounds/Euros/Dollors/Yen to 0 and therefore he would topple the economy and present a new government using knuts, sickle and gallons. Make muggles be slaves and work them for nothing while making food proces high for non magical.

While poor magicals, like the Weasleys get better wages and food isnt expensive.this would create a massive depression leading to a rebellion which would ultimately fail (See Pilgrimage of Grace)

Voldemort would be untouchable and life would continue like this until something major happens and life ceases to exist.

Congrats!
