** My first though : Haha, a bug (it's Unix epoch time, so if you screwed up the value of datetime, you might get one), but apparently it's the only HP fanfic with that publication date, the nearests are on the 1999. Has the writer found a nice hack to do it or FF staff just feeiling humorous?

** Oh man, I think that's the original Indie!Harry which spawned all those tropes I hate. What a relic.

  Now AU, 6th Year, following OoTP. Tired of the way Dumbledore and the Order treat him, and ready to face his destiny, Harry dedicates long hours to muggle and magical training to take the fight to Voldemort for a change. Slight HPGW, not shippy though.

**** The name and the publish date is a bit ironic. Let's go ask from Unspeakables how this happened.

** So is it about Hermione/Ginny being told to go get coffee while the men figure things out and drink firewhiskey? Actually a Mad Men/Harry Potter parody would probably be amazing.

** For most computers, time is measured in seconds or milliseconds since 1 January 1970 at midnight in UTC. Factor in a time zone of America/Los Angeles and that becomes 4pm on 31 December 1969.

Between ffn and fictionpress, you've got like ten million stories from across eighteen years. It's unsurprising that a few stories have had their data corrupted and their first publication date lost.

** Wow, between this and the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/4y1nlp/zhang_fei_glitch_on_ffn/][Zhang Fei glitch]] there really is a lot of weirdness going on at FFN.

** Well, isn't it obvious?

This is the original story. JKR's series is actually a fanfiction of this story.

** I recall Rosswrock posting that somehow when he started this story that ffnet posted the date, and that he wasn't able, or care enough to fix it. He keeps promising to update the story , but its what, 8 years out? meh
