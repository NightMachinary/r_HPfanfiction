I know, I know, most of you don't like Percy, which is completely justified.

However, I think maybe someone could write a fic where basically this happens.

A little taste of what i'm thinking:

Percy Weasley has always felt like the odd one out in his family, he wasn't as hectic, he was quiet and ambitious. Why did no one appreciate him? Was he not good enough? Why did no one care about his accomplishments?!

Another line down his arm, that would definitely scar, that helped, a constant reminder that he needed to be better.

Maybe then they would like him, but he knew that was unlikely, after all, he would always be,

The Worst Weasley.
