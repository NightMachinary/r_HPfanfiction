Er... What it says on the tin.

It would be cool to see more about either the past wars, or a longer version of the war in Deathly Hallows, not ending on the Battle of Hogwarts.

And let's face it, espionage is a cool, cool theme, so if there's a lot of doubt of peoples loyalties, intelligence gathering, and stuff, it would be awesome. But not necessary. Just war is cool.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]] is very AU, but the wars and battles are entertaining. It's not for everybody as it does get wordy and there's always a lot of stuff going on. The author also likes to hide some things from the reader and reveal it at a perfect time, which I like. linkffn(5904185)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3155057/1/Altered-Destinies][Altered Destinies]] is an epic story set in the great war against Grindelwald. It has large-scale warfare and spying/subterfuge aplenty. I've recommended this three times in the past week in a purely coincidental fashion as it seems to fit everywhere. linkffn(3155057)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]] is probably the fic that best represents war. It also delves into its impact on your everyday Joe, which makes the entire story much more compelling. It focuses on Hermione, but there are pov's of many other characters. I have a few quibbles about it, but nothing major. linkffn(11910994)

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** linkffn(Sin & Vice by mak5258) is Hermione-centric, has some time-travel (but not the usual way it's done) and shows a lot of the Order's side of the second Voldemort war as it was beginning. There's a fair bit of espionage and general bad-ass-ery.

  In her sixth year, Dumbledore makes Hermione a key figure in a plan to help Harry defeat Voldemort. (It's difficult to summarize this without spoilers--- HG/SS; there's a Time Turner involved but probably not how you expect; the story really gets started in Chapter Three.)

** I like stories where Percy ended up helping a lot of people from inside the Ministry. It redeems him as a character and a person. Plus, it makes his involvement in the war a lot more tangible. These two are my most favorites.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5715586/1/Proving-Them-Wrong][Proving Them Wrong]] by GriffinSky)

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3784000/1/The-Scarlet-Pimpernel][The Scarlet Pimpernel]] by AMarguerite)

The next recommendation is different considering it's a crossover (Captain America the First Avenger) and it takes places during World War 2 or known in the Wizarding World, the Rise of Grindelwald. Not to mention, from Tom Riddle Jr's point of view (I hope that doesn't derail you from considering to read the story). It's an interesting plot and very well develop since it goes deeper Tom's character growth as well involves more a WW2 style of war. I highly recommend you read it anyways.
