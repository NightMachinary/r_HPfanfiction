I have read my fair share of Slytherin Harry fics and the only Hufflepuff ones that I read were crack ( including one where he is quite lazy) and one shots.


** Have you read the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1092927][Different House, Different Home]] series? It's a couple of short one shots in the same universe, but they do feature a Hufflepuff Harry. I haven't read all of them myself, but the ones I did I remember liking.

** There's a good (unfinished) boy who lived story, where he's sorted into Hufflepuff. I have no idea what it's called, but the premise is that Harry is the /only/ child who lived after Voldie murdered every child Harry's age, a year older, and a year younger.

** There is a quite good story on potions and snitches where they have an inter house exchange, but I can't remember the name of the story but I think the author was JAWorley.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!
