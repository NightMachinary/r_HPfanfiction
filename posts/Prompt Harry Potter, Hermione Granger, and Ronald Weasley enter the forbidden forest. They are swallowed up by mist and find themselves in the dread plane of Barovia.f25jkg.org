That's right, our heroes are guests of the devil himself, Count Strahd von Zarovich.


** It's like you're calling me out specifically... Considering I'm DMing three games of Curse of Strahd at the moment... The only thing keeping me from currently writing something up is the fact that I'm at work! But maybe later...

*** I too am DMing Curse of Strahd. I wonder how Hermione would act in the Amber Temple?

**** My first thought would be her reaction to the card reading, considering her history with divination...

I suppose it would all depend on what age we're going with. I think my favourite would be just after the fall of Voldemort, because they just got done with one nearly immortal bastard, and now they've got another one.

I wonder if the rules of magic would also change. Or their magic stays the same but things in Barovia are also standard D&D. Strahd would certainly be amused and intrigued by this strange magic...

***** Theyd translate into sorcerers because their magic seems biological, though they arent nearly as powerful as any DnD magic users

****** Yes, that's what I was thinking too, but, although they're not as powerful as high level magic users, they do have a lot of diversity in their spell usage, which is not very sorcerer-like. It'd certainly be interesting to someone as interested in the arcane as Strahd, something like that...
