Technically a crossover fic, but there's no PoT FF subreddit that I know of, nor is there a HPxover one, so I figured here was my best bet. It's a long shot, but does anyone have a copy of Cywscross's All the World's a Stage fanfic somewhere? Cywscross is going to put it back up eventually, but in the mean time I've developed a sudden urgent need to reread it. Here's hope? Urgh I'm so sad fanfic archives don't work anymore.


** What is PoT?

** I do have a copy of it until chapter 7. I can't remember tho if the writer ever updated after that.
