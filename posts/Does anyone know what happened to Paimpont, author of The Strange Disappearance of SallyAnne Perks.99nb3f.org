****** I actually didn't like it. The premise was good but finding out who Sally-Anne Perks was felt anti-climatic. I don't know why but that's just my opinion.

***** I'll probably get downvoted but I really didn't think it was that great. It's engaging and will keep you reading but I've never felt so indifferent about a story after finishing. I've been disappointed in a lot of stories, disliked a lot, and underwhelmed by a fair amount. But this is one of the few that I've just been completely indifferent about. I've read it twice and almost nothing from this story has stuck with me.

****** Sally-Anne has one of these mysteries that readers really like, especially since it has no relation to Voldemort at all and has sort of an emotional ending with the original elements from the books. Rarely do you stumble upon such fics and everytime there's a request for these kinds of stories, next to nothing comes up, unfortunately. There's also the fact that it uses a very minor and overlooked character, well, two, and still manages to make you interested in them, despite both being practically OC's.

** You could try PMing them. The annoying thing about private messages on FFN is that if you have them enabled, it sends out an email notification for each and every one, and there's no way to disable them.

User has a profile on nanowrimo, only used in 2011 with the completion of a *50123* words fantasy text called "In Time of Silver Rain". Nothing about that text could be found by googling.

... That's all I got.

** I like Paimpont's stories. There's one about Merope Gaunt and Tom Riddle Sr. If I'm not mistaken, s/he also wrote the Dr. D stories. Dumbledore as a psychotherapist and McGonagall as his secretary--quite an imagination Paimpont had.
