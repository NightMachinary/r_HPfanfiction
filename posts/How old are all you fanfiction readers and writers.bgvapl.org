** I'm 23 personally, but my first foray into the amazing world of fanfiction was when I was your age. I dont particularly adverstise it but I've been mocked for it too when I was younger.

But I read for myself because I enjoy it, not for the sakes of others, and you'll realise soon enough when you grow up that the opinions of others don't matter regarding your hobbies. Not only that but you won't give a damn. So just enjoy it ;)

**** I think I started around 16 or so and writing a little later. I write for a living now (not fiction....boring stuff!) but still. Dedicating time to improving my craft wasn't wasting my time as it turns out, except when I was reading or writing fic to avoid revising at uni.

** I'm 28. I've been reading since i was about twelve. I'm an engineer, so people mock me because they think that somebody with my profession shouldn't be still reading ffs. But I don't care, i read for my enjoyment and nobody can't tell me what to do üòÅ.

** 21, But I got into fanfiction at 12-13 because I always was interested in the "What if this happened?" sense of things. I opened an account when I was 14 and I still have it. Unfortunately, my first stories had tons of spelling, grammar, etc mistakes that have no good reason being there. I wish I invested in a beta lol. I also wish I planned out my stories better so that I wouldn't have so many abandoned ones haha.

I know much better now.
