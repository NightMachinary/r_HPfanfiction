Hey there, kind Redditors.

EDIT: Found my people, thanks guys!

I am currently working on a fanfiction, my first one set in the HP Universe, actually. I want it to be good and therefore need help! Further information:

- I am currently 40k words into it.

- I am no native english speaker, but I guess my english is pretty okay. Had it in school for 14 years. There might be a lot of grammar issues, though.

- The story is an OC centered story, set in the next generation. (Teddy plays a role).

- I am trying to focus on the topics friendship, growing up, Hogwarts life, ...

- As mentioned I need help with grammar here and there, but also on formating (paragraphs and stuff), since I suck at that and don't know how to do it properly. Also, suggestions for changes in the plot are always welcome!

I would much apprechiate help!

As said, it is my first HP fanfiction. I've written (started, currently on ice) some other ones, but nothing published yet. All in all I'm pretty new to this.

Any more questions? Feel free to ask! :)

Cheers!

** The Grammarly app is pretty good at correcting your spelling and some grammar as you go. It still makes mistakes sometimes, so it's good to have human eyes skim the fic as well.
