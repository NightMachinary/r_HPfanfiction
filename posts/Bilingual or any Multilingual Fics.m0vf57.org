** Do you mean as a plot point or that the author wrote the story using multiple languages? Is that a thing?

*** Just the protagonist or adjacent character knowing another language (or multiple), it wouldn't have to be the plot point but preferably it would be a causal mention that follows throughout the story. I find it super interesting how authors deal with the subject of language. Myself being bilingual gets kinda bored of just reading one language at a time tho lol

  In which Harry realises he owes the wizarding world nothing and runs before he can compete in the Triwizard Tournament. It may cost him his magical core, but the price of freedom is worth it.

Come back to me, and I will ensure that you are as utterly comfortable as I can make you. You may be assured that I will never rest my immortal body until I have you once again.”--“I did not intend to -- ”“You did so intend! Well? Will you finally stop moping now that the box was not-empty for a night?”“No,” Voldamort snarled. “This fixes nothing.”--A retrospective tale of language gaps, of untrustworthy memories, and of the culmination of a millennia long affair between a Dark Lord and a counterrevolutionary. -- (summary edited 2020.12.19)
