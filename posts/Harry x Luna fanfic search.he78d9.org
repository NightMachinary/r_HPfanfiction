The story I know harry and Luna both are able to see the magic in somebody's core its a three part series and that's all I know sorry for the vagueness


** Pretty sure it's the Firebird trilogy starting with Firebird's Son. And a link violates reddit rules IIRC, so I'm going to stick with the title

** Not sure if this is the right stories but the Our Lady o'the Bless'd Do Over series by Rotary File has Luna and Harry (and some others) able to see magic. I think it's the second story in the series that has this.
