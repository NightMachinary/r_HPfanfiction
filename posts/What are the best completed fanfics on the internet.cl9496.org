Throughout the many years, I've only read H/HR. It's the ride or die ship. The best ship. And I guarantee I've read all of them. Every single one of them. Like when I say I read fanfiction, I really mean I read H/HR. (So yeah, no h/hr suggestions lol.)

But I've come to a startling realization. Since I've literally only read H/HR, I know for a fact I've missed out on some of the best fanfics to ever grace the internet.

Which is a damn shame.

Looking for adventure/drama oriented stories (stories where the author does an uncontrollable and impressive amount of world building), HP vs Voldemort centric, with a nice sprinkle of romance (or a lot, I'm not picky) (prefer a main heterosexual pairing).

Thanks.

Edit: Honestly though, if it's a great fic, or in your opinion one of the best fics on the internet, it doesn't have to meet my preferences.


** Oh! This is something I'd love to help with, though a lot of my favorite fics aren't Harry/Voldemort centric. I think this series is absolutely worth a read.

linkfffn(5957714) The Darkness Within trilogy by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1034541/Kurinoone][Kurinoone]]. It's a series in which Peter Pettigrew kidnapped Harry and took him to Volemort, who raises him as a 'son'/second-in-command. If you don't want to read a full trilogy the first book is a great stand alone. Very Harry/Voldemort-centric with one of my favorite pairings- Harry and Ginny. I've re-read this series /multiple/ times, which is rare for me. I think it's amazing.

#+begin_quote
  Hedwig is a very smart owl; none would dare deny that! So what is a very smart owl to do when she finds her human's living conditions unsatisfactory? Finding a new home is top of the list. Finding a mate for him is right after it. After all how is an owl supposed to justify having owlets if her human hasn't had children of his own yet? Very much a humor fic, no bashing of anyone.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.

Worth of the Soul is Harry/Hermione for most of it before it becomes Harry/Susan so you might like that one.

As a side note, I've never much liked Harry/Hermione because it's always seemed really unrealistic to me (and most of them are bad). You got any good ones that I could try?

  As his sixth year begins, Harry is forced to take up his destiny earlier that anticipated. With Voldemort slowly taking over, everyone looks to Harry to lead them, all while Juggling school, friends, the seach for the Horcruxes, and teenage love. In the process, Harry slowly learns about not only himself, but the true worth of the soul! Harry/Susan

**** I just want the relationship to be believable, without either of them being completely out of character. And no excessive bashing, I don't enjoy reading that. Ron doesn't necessarily have to be a main character, but I'd prefer it if he's at least a decent human being.

Stories:

Three Seasons to Closure - The second best pure romance I've read. It's not love story masquerading a very poor adventure or drama story. Or rather, it's simply a romance that didn't need anything else. No matter what, it's 16 chapters of a love story done right. Set in a post-Voldemort world, Harry and Hermione have more time together after Ron gets married. 5/5 [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7149/16]]

Angelica - Harry is the descendant of Arthur. And he needs the fabled sword of Excalibur to defeat Lord Voldemort. (A good combo of romance and adventure.) 3.5/5 [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7056]]

Blindness - Harry is blinded by the Avada Voldemort sent him. He still sees somehow. And he has a genius mind. A dark story of a troubled Harry. 3.5/5 [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness]]

Time is Fire - The best romance I've ever read - but it's not a pure romance story. Pretty suspenseful and a quick read. And there's one romance scene that just ... does everything. Every - damn - emotion. Impossible you say?, just read it bro. Def a top 5. Can't really tell much or else I'll ruin the suspense. 5/5 [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6033933/1/Time-is-the-Fire]]

The many Deaths of Harry Potter - my FAVORITE FIC OF ALL TIME. It's not as complex as some fanfics go. The prose isn't the best, the worldbuilding isn't the strongest, but there's something so charming about the story. The horcrux in Harry keeps him alive until he beats Lord Voldemort. Romance isn't really a thing till the end. 10/5 [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12388283/1/The-many-Deaths-of-Harry-Potter]]

Memorable One Shots (Fluffy ones are the only ones I can remember rn lol)

Serendipity of an Odd Sort - Harry and Hermione have become cordial, civil, strangers. They have no one to blame for themselves. And one chance meeting leads them to rediscover their friendship. One of the greatest fluff one shots ever in my opinion. 5/5

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4203462/1/Serendipity-of-an-Odd-Sort]]

Another World: Hermione Chapter - It's a AU oneshot where Hermione and Harry aren't magical but ordinary students. Harry is a delinquent and Hermione is Harvard destined. 5/5

[[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/8897]]

‘Harry you prat' - Harry is an accidental jerk to Hermione and finds out she has feelings for him. 5/5 [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/6030]]

Honorable Mentions (Friendship/allies/no romance yet)

Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux - An extremely well written fanfic about Harry discovering the horcrux inside of him before he starts. You WILL get horrible undertones and frantic speculations where this might all lead. There is a sequel that is sadly not finished. Might be one of the best written works on fan fiction.net. Kinda reminded me of Methods of Rationality .... but ten times better in my opinion. I should mention the author has said he has no idea if or who Harry would be partners with. I always hope H/hr, but there are signs Harry might swing the other way. 5/5 [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11762850/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Accidental-Horcrux]]

Hogwarts Battle School - Inspired by Ender, and extremely well written. Sadly a WIP that might not be finished. Arguably one of the greatest concepts in Harry Potter fanfiction. 4.5/5 [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School]]

Hopefully you might enjoy one of these lol. If not, I honestly have to say it's a damn shame.
