AndrewWolfe, author of Ghost of Privet Drive and No Fate, hasn't updated No Fate since December 31st. Prior to that, he was adding a new chapter every other Friday.

Does anyone know if anything happened to him?

  it's a finding-time-to-write thing, at the moment. Lot of tasks, a couple of minor ailments, and a seriously ill dog landed on me all at once during a time of Reduced Spoons

** I'd imagine it's just life in general intruding on fic time. At least, I hope it is. The man is too good a writer to have anything serious happen. He does write professionally as well I think, even if it isn't fiction, so maybe he's just slammed.

Best of luck to you Mr. Wolfe whatever is happening. :)

*** I concur. He's one of my favorite writers in years, and I love his stories. He had mentioned bouts of illness, not you-know-what, and I'm worried that something might have happened to him. If his self-characterization is anything to go by, he reminds me of my grandfather, and I'd hate for him to have come to any harm.

I also eagerly await Mr. Wolfe's next installment, and wish him well.

  "Fix it" said the Fates. "Fix what? With what tools and skills?" I asked. Being dead was only the first of the obstacles. And then I found myself in an understairs cupboard listening to a little boy quietly sobbing. Oh. Fix THAT. In which a sarcastic old git is dropped into the awful childhood of Harry Potter. SI-ish. Rated M for foul language and canon-level abuse.
