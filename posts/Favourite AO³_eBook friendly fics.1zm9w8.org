As ff.net have disabled the ability of flagfic.com to convert stories to ebooks, which was my favourite way to get fanfic while on the go, does anyone have fix recommendations for archiveofourown.com or other sites that offer epub downloads? (Or at least that work with flagfic)

My tastes are vast, though I cannot abide bad spelling and grammar. I prefer long fics to short ones.

Alternatively, what's your favourite way to read fanfic while not at home/at a PC?

Cheers!


** Might I recommend [[http://ficsave.com/][FicSave]]?

*** Fic save keeps on adding weird symbols everywhere, at least for me (Kindle for Android, latest version). I prefer Fanfiction Downloader (the app)

*** I use calibre regularly, but if I'm on the move looking for a new fic, I like the convenience of a based downloader.

** If I really am completely 'on the go' I just save the current chapter (for example from an email alert or just something I found while on my phone in a lecture) to my [[http://www.getpocket.com][Pocket]] and use the app. For anything else (especially as I use both a Kindle and [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flyersoft.moonreader][Moon+ Reader]]) I just download the fics from all aorund the web (mostly ff.net though) using [[http://calibre-ebook.com/][Calibre]] and the [[http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=163261][FanFictionDownLoader Plugin]]. If you put the library folder in your dropbox (or similar) you will always have your favourite fics at your fingertips ;)

*** Sounds similar to what I do. :) I love me some Moonreader. That's my main non-kindle book reader.
