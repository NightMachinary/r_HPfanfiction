So I'm writing a fic and have been referencing back to the books for certain parts for accuracy/refresher since not everything in the fic is AU/canon divergent (at least not in the beginning), but I noticed that when they describe sitting in the Great Hall it's worded like they're in chairs not on benches which is seen a lot in fics and also was in the movies.

During the Howler scene, Ron is described as having "sunk low in his seat." I think it's easier to sink low in a chair than on a bench. Also I find it hard to imagine that a place like Hogwarts wouldn't or couldn't provide chairs with backs for their students. I doubt the Professors are sitting on long benches. Dumbledore sits in some large throne like chair at the Head Table. Why shouldn't the students have proper chairs?

I'm only in the beginning on book 2 right now so I'm not sure if it's mentioned later on (or previously and I missed it) that it is in fact benches or chairs in the Great Hall. I also checked the HP fandom wiki page and it doesn't say anything about the seats. Just the long tables.

Either way, I know a lot of us probably imagine the long benches that are seen in the movies, but who else imagines the Great Hall with chairs rather than benches? Which do you prefer? What kind of chairs would they be?


** I prefer benches for the aesthetic (reminds me of uni!) and for the possibilities in writing - if they're sitting on benches, you can have a character sliding closer or further away from someone, a character squeezing themselves in between two others, sitting in all different sorts of positions that's more difficult on a chair... loads of things! It's also easier for the poor house-elves, moving a few benches back into position is quicker than hundreds of individual chairs, even with magic.

*** Benches do have a certain aesthetic to them and the possibility of a lot of different opportunities. So much easier to scoot around if there are benches- which is really cute. I think chairs have their own flair too. Like someone leaning on two legs too far and then ends up falling backwards. Someone needs to leave dramatically or in shock so they knock over their chair loudly and draw the hall's attention to them.

*edit*: We don't have benches in any of the dining halls at my Uni. We have tables with chairs and some booths, but no benches. Only had benches in middle and high school.

  Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him.

This is from the sorting in PS. So chairs is canonical, but I think I generally prefer benches, for the reasons other commenters have mentioned. Potential to squeeze in between to people, scooch up the bench, etc.

I think I remember Fred and George squeezing in between people in the books, but that might not be right.

** Someone offered chairs, I'll offer benches:

#+begin_quote
  They did it, all of them; the benches scraped as everyone in the Hall stood, and raised their goblets, and echoed, in one loud, low, rumbling voice, “Cedric Diggory.”
#+end_quote

(GoF)

#+begin_quote
  “I'd forgotten Wood had left,” said Hermione vaguely as she sat down beside Ron and pulled a plate of toast towards her. “I suppose that will make quite a difference to the team?”

  “I's'pose,” said Harry, taking the bench opposite. “He was a good Keeper...”

  “Still, it won't hurt to have some new blood, will it?” said Ron.
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  “Do mine ears deceive me?” said Fred, arriving with George and squeezing on to the bench beside Harry.
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  “At least it's only lines,” said Hermione consolingly, as Harry sank back on to his bench and looked down at his steak and kidney pie, which he no longer fancied very much. “It's not as if it's a dreadful punishment, really...”
#+end_quote

(OotP)

And a few more. I'm not going to search for "chair" because lol, but given that benches appear only from the end of GoF, I suppose it could be one of the things Rowling changed her mind about. And yes, the teachers would have chairs (and perhaps even designated places) in any case.

Anyway, more important, if you want realism, is not falling into the looks/overhear trap. From trying this IRL, I can tell you it is extremely hard to tell if someone is looking at you from across the hall or not, and it's flatly impossible to overhear someone a few seats down if everyone is talking, never mind on another table.

Because you squeeze many more people on one bench than on chairs put in its place. So, I believe that the Head Table had chairs, but students were sitting on benches.

** I think this comes down to numbers.

First, there are a lot of students and the Great Hall can ever be so big. So, the movies choose benches as the most practical option.

Second, as we have talked ad naseum before, the wizarding community numbers do not add up. If we were faithful, we would have sorting of over 150 kids each year, and 7 times that students on 4 tables. so we're talking about something over 130 students seated in each side of each table. It would mean over 100mts long Great Hall. And that's being low on estimates.

*** I've always had my own issues with the disproportionate number of students to wizarding community size. Even with the smallest possible number of students per year, the idea of just 4 long tables to fit everyone felt odd to me. Making the room so long in one direction seemed ill fitting too.

I'd like to think there were still long tables, but like more than one row for each house. Or they were broken up every so often. Leaving room between them to help traffic flow. Otherwise, if you were on one side of the table and needed to get to the other side, you'd have to walk /all the way/ to the end of the table to just make a U-turn and go back.

**** Maybe a circular room with the head table in the middle? Then get 1/4 circle for each house?

***** I think a rectangle is fine for a room, especially a Great Hall, but the idea of having 4 100m+ long tables in an extremely long room with an improper width seems a bit ridiculous.

** I prefer branches because of what other people said about all the possibilities but also chairs seem very formal and in my mind are used in class more and that their time in the great Hall would be more relaxed.

** I like chairs. you can still squeeze next to someone and sit on their chair with them if it wasn't a chair with arm rests, but a more simple one. which would make sense because of the amount of them. benches are just not very comfy for longer period of time. like feasts. and when you go sit, you need to overstep the bench. wizards wore robes. they would be kind of hard to manage. and girls have skirts and what not. it's easier to just move the chair to sit on it. also, you can't move the bench, but can move the chair, if you want to sit closer or farther from the table. you could still move away or closer to someone... with the chair. I guess I have benches in my head too because of the movies. I need to reprogram.

to the great hall, it was pretty big in the books. not so much in the movies, I think the tables would need to be divided too. and not be just one continuous table. also, it would need to be even longer than how many students there are so they could always choose a seat and not sit where there is an empty place. unless their seats are assigned or at least divided by year. which is not in canon. every year having their own table in their house and the next year the table next to it and so on, would make sense.

** There were benches in my schools and some of my college dining halls, so I imagine Hogwarts would choose the same for the same reasons. They don't want comfortable seats for kids to linger on, they want them to eat fast and get to class.
