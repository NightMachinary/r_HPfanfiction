It's something that occurred to me, what if harry goes back in time by accident when hit by Voldemort's AK. He goes back to his childhood with the Dursley's with the knowledge, magic, memory's and all the trauma he accumulated over the course of the books and decides to train himself and learn all the magic he can to prevent all the bloodshed at the war... but in doing so he becomes a dark lord by accident.

It's like this, at that scene Harry had, literally every reason to be a mess, he saw lots of his friends (some that he himself trained to fight creating the potential for him feeling survivors guilt) die in the battle of Hogwarts, nearly every parental figure he had was dead, he discovery that it was his most hated professor that had told Voldemort the prophecy (driving his previous hatred for the man to levels previously unreachable) and to top it of he learns that not only he has a piece of the man who murdered his parents in him, preventing Voldemort from being killed while it is in him but his mentor, the one he trusted for seven years not only knew but also did nothing, letting him discover only at the last second when there is literally nothing he could try get it of without getting killed (remember, no talk with Dumbledore at Kings Cross means no chance of knowing about the blood protection anchoring him to life). At this point he has every motive of the book to be feeling betrayed, guilt and furious, as such him going back in time at this moment would have very... interesting consequences. I see it going kind of like this;

-He would obviously not trust Dumbledore, no reconciliation with him either, at this point for good or for bad he wouldn't trust ANYTHING Dumbledore says and is quite angry at the man. Dumbledore for his part is, understandable confused about where this whole hostility is coming from and quite concerned (I personally see Dumbledore as being a good person that is thrust in a situation he is not prepared to deal with but still tries to make the best out of it, yeah he makes some mistakes, but he is in no way malevolent, but take the perspective of the Harry from that point of the story, he really wouldn't see it).

-Snape he would want to kill on the spot, the knowledge of it being him to sell his parents to the dark lord, plus the years of hatred shared between them and then finally reliving some years of the consequences of Snape telling Voldy the prophecy (aka the Dursley's) with the eyes of a (mostly) adult and he really would want Snape dead.

-Probably the most important, he would have seen with his own eyes the destruction caused by the war and how much time exactly he has to prepare, so he would be willing to do anything to prevent it, yes, he would be quite uncomfortable doing some of the goriest rituals or spells, but he would end up pushing on so he can prevent the war (I have this image of a six-years-old Harry almost pulling his hair out in frustration at a book he's reading, start to get up to do any other thing, remember Colin's death then sit back down with an extremely guilty face)

-Thing is, he would end up becoming a dark lord without perceiving it. He would want to learn the mind arts the quickest way possible an end-up training using the muggles in Little Whining, yes he would feel really bad about it in the beginning, but would end justifying it with them ignoring child-abuse and him really needing it.

-He would also teach himself wand-less magic he spent seven years practicing magic and knows that Voldemort could already do it when he was really eleven, at this point not using magic would be frankly inconceivable to him, if it has to be wand-less than so be it (probably throw in some runic magic too).

-He would learn the dark arts (maybe using the mind arts in the horcrux now that he knows about it) so that he can fight better and also to take out the soul-piece (it seems to be very obscure and nobody else used a human being as one before, so it would be very hard, Dumbledore didn't manage it).

-He would try his best to accumulate power, he knows where some very useful artifacts and books are -room of requirement and the death hollows, including the resurrection stone he could use to get the dead to teach him magic- and knows very well what will happen if he isn't strong, so he will try to get as much power as possible, no reluctance in accepting any and all advantages he can get his hands on.

-He would try to get his friends as powerful as possible too so that they are prepared, he would also try to get as many ally's as possible, so he has more people prepared for war and Voldemort less followers, this includes Death Eaters like Lucius. Inadvertently he is very good at it since he already knows at least a little about most of his classmates. But in doing so he, without noticing, makes his very own inner circle.

-He would try to get Fudge out of the office and some puppet minister (Lockhart for example) as soon as possible, this way he can prepare the government to the war... but he doesn't realizes that in doing so he is taking the ministry to himself.

-He tries to get all of Voldemort's other allies at his side, at some point some DE notice he is a dark lord and try to get in his side, they tell him so and, while he doesn't think he is a Dark Lord, he accepts so that they don't go to Voldemort's side (probably some magical contract) and send them in some missions so that he can keep the ruse, probably gets out of letting them hurt muggleborns by claiming he don't want to have any hint of his plans getting to the ministry and out of making them fight by claiming he already controls the government and can use the aurors, so it would be mostly magical and political support.

In the end Voldemort and Dumbledore are dead, the government belongs to him, and he has a loyal base of support ready to conquer the world... after having topped the British government... and all the while being absolutely certain that he is not actually a Dark Lord at all.


** I'd love something like this the closest fanfic I know to this is

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8195669/1/The-Rise-of-a-Dark-Lord]]

Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.

*** Sounds like it's slash. And he didn't ask for a Voldemort team up. I personally don't understand how anyone could ever read and enjoyna fic where he helps Voldemort. Unless you turn the entire story on its head and all the 'good' guys are the bad guys...? But with Voldemort and the death eaters the way they are? Bizarre.

Personally I like the idea of a Harry becoming this hypocrtical excessively righteous dark lord that won't allow anything he deems not right to ever be expressed or done. Like every crime imaginable being punsihed to the extreme. And basically killing anyone who disagress with him?

But the whole supporting Voldemort thing? Sounds more like a psychopaths dream to me. Not sure why that would be fun to read.

**** Sometimes it's fun to read from a psychopaths perspective ie American psycho or lolita. It's a pretty unexplored genre unfortunately imo.

***** Hmm sure but those are movies. You could say the same about Joker. Fanfiction walks a much thinner line imo. And usually it's pretty clear which type of audience a story is aimed at, if you catch my drift.

****** They were books long before they were movies my guy. Not to say the movies are bad but the books are amazing and explore the genre very in-depth.

** This is a really cool concept! I like the idea of Harry slowly getting twisted down the path of amassing power, not realizing that it was what corrupted Voldemort in the first place.

*** I think it's a good excuse. There was a fic where Harry takes a train at Ghost Kings Cross and ends up in the past instead of in the afterlife by accident (but I think later he finds out it was Death's meddling or something?? I dont remember the story) Kings Cross is a crossroads kind of place, so in my mind it makes sense for it to lead to all sorts of unexpected places.

But really, the first thing that came to mind when I read OP's post is Harry going back to the first time he got hit by the AK, when he was 1 year old, because of some sort of connection, or "closing the loop" or something like that.

*** Frankly, this is just an excuse for time travel that doesn't involve the character doing so of his own free will, the A.K is the most convenient event at the moment I would want the time travel to happen. But to make an excuse I could argue that it's due to the blood protections plus the two A.Ks he received in his life coming from the same person, so he could receive the curse, but don't go to kings cross, instead he is set to go back in his body instantly by the blood protection. But instead of going back to the moment of the second killing curse, the fact of it being on a place outside time plus the fact that Harry would be in danger at the forbidden forest (what with all the death eaters and Voldemort there) making it a bad alternative in the ‘eyes' of the protections would take him back to the moment of the first killing curse.

Though to be fair, this explanation is kind of open to interpretation and would open a can of worms to bring him back at petty much any point in the story: Dudley's birthday- when he used one of Voldemort's abilities for the first time, end of first year - when he used the protection to kill Quirel, fourth year when the protection was anchored in Voldemort with the ritual... In the end it's more of an excuse than anything else
