  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord.

  Sequel to "Weasley Girl"! Potter's Gang are back for their second year at Hogwarts, and face a dramatic escape, a mysterious diary, a strange cat, a "loony" girl, a hidden monster and many past secrets coming to light. It looks like this year will be at least as eventful and dangerous as the previous one.

*** I didn't really like 'The Difference one man can make' but i linkffn(The Last Lion of House Reyne) from the same author is one my absolute favorites.

Especially the last Valyria chapter was amazing and Ashara is just awesome.

  I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  Angels have their shadows. Shining in silver and tomorrow, world rotating upon its shoulders, stands Metropolis, and with him, his guardian, bright and forward as the city himself.    Angels have their shadows. Within these shadows stands a symbol cloaked in the night, crouching behind a gargoyle of stone.

** Definitely linkffn(put your curse in reverse)! Especially now that it's gotten more mystery/adventurish.

Lately linkffn(reign of the serpent) is back! Seeing an update email for that story has me dropping everything else immediately!
