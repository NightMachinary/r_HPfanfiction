What are some of the most common names you've seen for Hermione's Parents?

I'm a Harmony shipper, so I see a lot of "Dan and Emma Granger" do Romione shippers see "Rupert and Emma".

I've also seen her mom called Alice a lot.

Just thought it'd be fun to see if there are some common themes throughout the fandom.


** I feel like most fics I've read give Hermione's mom a Greek or Shakespearean name like Helen, Dione, etc.

** ...I never, until this moment, got the "Dan and Emma" reference. And wondered after reading it in several Harry/Hermione stories if all those authors just went with the first one chose. It even took me a moment after "Ruper and Emma", like "what does it have to do with the pairing?". I feel stupid now.

Other than those names: I think I never read the same names twice (at least nothing memorable).

** I see Jean a lot for her mum but Dan and Emma are the most common (and imo horrifically OOC names and a sign of a terrible Harmony fic to come).

*** Yeah, Dan and Emma make me wince. I see that about 50% of the time, and something random and pedestrian the other half.

*** You also see Jane sometimes in older fics, for the same reason. (JKR often gave Jane in interviews as her middle name before it was replaced with Jean in canon.)

**** To me "Dan and Emma" is a warning sign that I've probably started reading a bad, clich√©d Harmony fic.

** Richard 'Dick' and Jane, because they are normal, boring, and mostly unimportant to the story; they need very generic names.

Also, you could have a scene where Jane and Hermione go shopping in Diagon Alley, so Harry and Dick go to the Leaky Cauldron. Tom, Dick, and Harry are sitting at the bar...

However, it would make a Third Rock from the Sun crossover very confusing.

** When it's not Dan & Emma or some variation on that, I usually see Wendell & Monica (from the fake names Hermione gives them).

Until and unless they are "revealed" on Pottermore, I doubt there will be some consensus.

I'm mostly a Harmony shipper so I use Dan and Emma myself, or some variation on it (I like using Damocles as the father's name).

** I really hate coming across Dan and Emma as their names, but it's common.

One combination I've seen a few times is Herman/Jean, but I don't remember if the multiple instances were the same author or not.
