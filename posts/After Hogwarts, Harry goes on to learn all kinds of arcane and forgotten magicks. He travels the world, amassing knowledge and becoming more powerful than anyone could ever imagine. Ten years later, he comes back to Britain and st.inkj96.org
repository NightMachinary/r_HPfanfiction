*** I read one where Harry gets hit with ak in cos and Dumbledore is then free to help without fear of reprisal. They hire a non obliviated Lockhart to do media for them and get up to stuff. Fun fic so far but pretty sporadic in updates.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

*** I did read one where, Harry, does just that, although I don't know whether it was for ten years or not.

The knowledge isn't so much ancient though as it is just culturally different and focused on the different mediums practiced by different countries.

The story also quickly crosses over into Game Of Thrones/A Song Of Ice And Fire. So fair warning it doesn't stick to the wizarding world for long.

I don't know if you can find it on other sites but I found this on FF.net.

**** I can't remember the name. What I remember though, is that Draco had become the potions teacher and Harry had disappeared from Magical Britain. Draco meets him 10 years later and invites him to Hogwarts. Harry is then very powerful as he had been traveling, amassing knowledge and power. Draco invites him primarily because of a terrorist organization - this time made up of muggleborns disenchanted of the government that want to finish off purebloods, as they are the "root of all evil in magical society." And Harry is something akin an icon to them.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12373699/1/TSSD-Prequel-A-new-world-A-new-chance]]) matches the first part of (fem) Harry traveling around the world learning all kinds of magic. She doesn't come back to Britain, though, but transports herself to the Elemental Nations (Naruto).

Treads the fine line between playing tropes straight and subverting them, like Harry has all the Lordships - but doesn't touch politics, simply reads books from their libraries.

You do realize that the word magick is an archaic spelling revived by Aleister Crowley... right? No matter what wiccans say, it's still a spelling mistake.
