#+begin_example
  a fanfic where Snape is the main character
#+end_example

I've read a lot of them and reread them as well.

^{Also,} ^{please} ^{no} ^{slash,} ^{sorry.}


** Do you like Snape/Lily? How about Snape gets to relive his life fics?

linkffn(a dream carved in stone) - my favorite Snape/Lily ever though it is AU

linkffn(the moment it began) - probably the best Snape gets to relive his life story out there and it's complete!

linkffn(second start)

linkffn(his greatest wish)

linkffn(come once again and love me)

linkffn(ananke) - tragically abandoned

linkffn(the apprentice by deborah peters) - also tragically abandoned

linkffn(obscura nox animae) - completely unique and awesome, ongoing

  Severus wakes up in the afterlife expecting something rather different than being almost-seventeen again. Seriously, what kind of game is this? But wait - Lily's come back, too - from 1981? Perhaps it's a second chance... but to do what? SS/LE
