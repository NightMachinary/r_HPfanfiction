** The Accidental Bond by kbo, linkffn(5604382), pairs Harry with Hermione, Ginny, and another girl. Very well written, some smut, and major Dumbledore/Molly/Ron bashing.

I'm actually surprised by the lack of good H/Hr/G stories. If Harry ever gets to have more than one girl, these two are the most likely ones to work out with each other. I even think the H/Hr/G trio should be more powerful and effective than the canon trio.

** linkffn(Soul Searching by chemprof) and linkffn(End Game by chemprof) can end H/Hr/Ginny, but I don't remember how much of the three way relationship is on screen. It's been a long while since I read them. But the author wrote 3 epilogues for the story, one H/Hr, one H/G, and one all three.

  Begins right after HBP and goes through summer. Besides searching for Horcruxes, focus is on the relationship between Harry and Hermione. They are the main characters, but it's not necessarily a romantic relationship. Some HG romance in the background.

  He then shoved the glass vial in the red head's face and demanded: "What is this?"

  "N- Nothing," Ginny defended, "it's just water."

  A large group of people, including Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Slughorn, had gathered around to see what the commotion was all about.

  "Pardon, if I may?" Horace Slughorn offered as he walked up to Harry. The younger, skinnier wizard handed the vial to the older, obese wizard. Slughorn held the vial up to his nose and inhaled deeply. A surprised look appeared on his face. "Oho, this is a Lust Potion... what are you planning on doing my dear?" he asked, turning to Ginny.

  "A Lust Potion?" Hermione asked, "Harry, what was she doing?"

  "She poured this into your drink," explained Harry and all the color from Hermione's face drained away.

  "It was... It was only a joke," stated Ginny.

  "My dear, a Lust Potion isn't something to trifle with," Slughorn said gravely. "It causes the person who drinks it to lose all of their inhibitions when it comes to physical passions. It's very similar to Love Potions if only much milder in its duration..."

  Harry suddenly recalled the conversation he had with Hermione a few days ago; she had said that she had acted strangely the previous school year, that she "felt compelled" to start dating. Then a question hit Harry, was the reason Hermione had "felt compelled" to date Ron and her strange behavior during the last year all because Ginny had poisoned her?

  "How many times have you poisoned her?" Harry demanded.
