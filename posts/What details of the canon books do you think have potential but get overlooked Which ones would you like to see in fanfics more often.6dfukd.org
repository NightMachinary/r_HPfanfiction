The details I mean can be characters, places, magical artefacts, magical beasts, cultural problems, anything mentioned in the books, really.

I recently reread parts of OotP, and I think it's often overlooked how deeply magical Grimmauld Place is. There aren't only the creepy house-elf heads mounted on a wall, but also a silver snuff box that bites, a robe that tried to murder Ron, a cuckoo's clock that shoots darts at people (and apparently wasn't charmed to to so, but developed this ability), doxies and a boggart...

So, what do you love about canon, but rarely see in fanfics?


** Magic. I mean I see spells but half of them boil down to a hundred and one ways to main another person. Magic/fantasy as a genre should be full of wonder and I think too few fanfictions capture that. Its not that I'm averse to the odd gritty story but when they reduce magic to throwing around coloured lights then you lose so much.

*** Oh yes. I think my example of Grimmauld Place also goes back to this issue. Often, we only get the big things writers remember from canon (at Grimmauld Place the screaming portrait and house elf heads, at Hogwarts the RoR or the CoS, maybe ghosts) and writers don't really seemed interested in exploring all that magic in the HP world could offer.

*** I have to disagree with you here.

For me there is nothing more uninteresting in a fic than when they have chapters of the economy because it almost always boils down to Harry somehow finding some loophole like selling galleons to muggles as gold which makes him super rich. What is the point of having a super rich Harry? It rarely adds anything to the story except to make Harry overpowered and usually it tends to feel like they're saying 'rich people are more deserving of respect than poor people' especially when the author goes on to bash the Weasleys as money grabbing thieves.

Also most people have a tenuous grip on the knowledge of real world economics let alone how inflation would damage a world run on magic.

** Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore

/Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorceror, Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards, Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry/

The man has so very many titles and jobs. But what do they actually mean? How does he juggle three, presumably, full-time jobs? Why /is/ he both the head of the legislative branch of the government, the head of the seemingly only magical school in Britain as well as Britain's ambassador to the Magical UN?

So very often in (bad) fanfiction his many positions are just used to give him tremendous and far reaching power to semi-legally completely fuck over our plucky heroes lives. Throwing people in jail without a trial. Promoting wholesale child abuse. Eating lemon drops. You know the kind of fics I'm talking about.

What I would like to see more is Dumbledore actually seen doing all those jobs and what comes with them; not just having them just be words to make him look important or be the means to a nefarious end.

You could, for example, take the books but flip the perspective from Harry to Dumbledore. Instead of Harry going to classes, brooding, playing Quidditch and getting in all kinds of hijinks, we could follow Dumbledore as he tries to keep Lucius Malfoys efforts to sway the Wizengamot (and Fudge) to his side. Have him try to keep and cultivate relations with the other nations for support in the upcoming war. Have him travel over the world researching for ways to remove the Horcrux from Harry. And then, when all his efforts are for naught, have him confront the fallout of his actions and failures.

That is what I would like to see more. Dumbledore as the good, extremely competent but severely overworked leader that he is. Not just as the wizened wizard that gives a few shoulder pats and mysterious twinkles. But as a man who does, or at least tries to do, everything to keep his beloved world from falling apart.

Well, we don't know for sure from canon that the Wizengamot is a legislature (we only ever see it as a judiciary) and from the travesty of a trial we see in /OoTP/ we can infer that the Chief Warlock's main job is to keep things going, sort of like an MC.

From /Fantastic Beasts and Where to FInd Them/ we see that the ICW is far more informal of a gathering than a UN-like body.

Another thing is what lets someone become a Wizard/Witch? How can Muggleborns be born with the ability to perform magic yet there are muggles that cannot perform magic? And does this tie into squibs and there inability to perform magic?

Grindelwald, we don't know much about him just a few things here and there. As it stands, I find Grindelwald more interesting then Voldemort so I wish we had some more backstory on him.

Lastly, is there a valid reason for hate of Muggles and muggleborns? That hate has to stem from somewhere, was there a time when muggles would enact in "Witch hunts" and is this why the Wizard population is so small compared to the muggle one?

** People intentionally decrease the size and wonder of the magical world. Wizards could have hidden magical cities, there are several magical creatures we have yet to explore, a nigh-infinite array of spells and magic in the libraries hidden throughout the world by ancient and powerful wizards hoping that it helps a wizard in need one day. Meanwhile, we have Harry over here spamming Stunners, Disarmers, and medium-level curses. Why is magic so downplayed all the time? Why is Voldemort still downgraded to being a human? If he's the most powerful Dark Lord of all time, he should be a city-buster at least. Nor does he instill any amount of fear in those that see him, sure his face can be imposing, but his demeanor, his whole being, it's supposed to present a facade of being untouchable, yet throughout the series (and various fanfictions) he can't seem to finish off a kid. People don't realize that we want Harry to suffer (as bad as that sounds), we want to see him broken so much that he finally realizes that he has to destroy his enemy with his magic and not love. Having him come out 'whole' in the encounter with Voldemort to just suddenly realize that he has to start fighting is not what fans want, at least, not what they *really* want. They want consequence, they want Harry to learn, not to escape with luck and chance. And I think that that is what Rowling and Fanfiction both do terribly wrong throughout the series. /rant

Aside from that, I would definitely like to see more focus on the culture of the magical world. Their supermarkets, their businesses, their way of life, how they industrialized, etc... It seems to be a society that runs on capitalism, so it would be nice to see all those small details that Rowling put into the story when it was still good (cough* first four books cough*). It was that kind of nuanced world-building that really immersed the readers, and I would definitely like to see how fanfic authors would add their own spin to things.

To be fair, that may even be somewhat synonymous.

When it comes to wizarding economy, I highly doubt we should see anything eve remotely like our financial economy. Magical Britain is not much bigger than a muggle village, population wise. Supermarkets and Industry is probably not a thing. Rather small grocers and manufacturing workshops would be the norm. You don't need to build 500.000 Firebolts, you only need a a few hundred - over the entire course of their series, and that's assuming they sell internationally. They're capitalists, yes, but only in a sense that they exchange currency for wares.

Since the Muggle populace is usually within the billions range, we can assume that the magical populace is in the hundred million range. It's still enough for mass industrialization.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

**** No guys he's clearly talking about the romance between Umbridge and Draco that subtly starts during OotP and then seems abandoned.

**** I presume, from his flair, that he's referring to Ginny and H/G romance. Though I'm not overly fond of this character, she gets less time than we ought to expect for the hero's future wife.

***** Yeah. She does get her moments, but she should've showed up more in GoF, OotP and got with Harry at the start of HBP IMO.
