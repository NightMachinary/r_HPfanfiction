In my opinion, Ao3 has a much better search engine than Fanfiction.net. However, it's almost exclusively slash, or at least the top 20 pages of fics. I know I can "-filter_ids xxxx," but that's so tedious and only works for specific tags like Voldemort/Harry Potter. Is there a way to filter out slash in its entirety?


** You can't filter slash entirely because people don't tag their fics the same, or even truthfully in some cases.

You can do things like -M/M, -slash, and -mpreg to search for fics without those tags. Like google, there can be a bit of...wizardry...involved in getting exactly what you want.

*** A small bit of witchery to go with your wizardry: put every search phrase in quotes, that gives the search engine a bit less leeway to give you horrible search results.

** To filter out slash, your best bet is to look for specific heterosexual pairings. You can filter out -M/M paired with looking for specific pairings, and that's as much as you can do.

--------------

I just want to mention something - this isn't an attack on those that dislike slash, but it's just a historical note re: Ao3 and who it's made for, 'cause I've seen a few people complain about all the slash on Ao3 - but Ao3 was made back in 2008 after a huge run through of LiveJournal taking down various communities and a lot of fanwork being lost in the process.

So, LJ was sold to a company called Six Apart, and basically they wanted to take down any content that today the Tumblrish fans and the like would probably label as "problematic" - stuff tagged rape, incest, underage, et cetera, et cetera. Ao3, then known as Fanlib, arose out of those circumstances because fans basically didn't want their works deleted by some higher power with no warning at all. The content didn't necessarily endorse or glorify any of that material, but it could merely have been warned for as a condemnation or any of the like - Six Apart deleted en masse.

They also specifically targeted slash communities. Many slash communities were deleted, and then reinstated, but then the whole thing occurred again... And then again.

"An Archive of One's Own" was pretty much proposed to make sure fans weren't targeted like that again, and that lots of content wouldn't be under threat if anybody felt under threat by something, or found some of the content uncomfortable or perhaps troubling to advertisers - that's why, unlike FFnet, there are no adverts on Ao3. That's why Ao3 have such loose terms of service as to what they will allow to be posted on the site, and they they will only take down material that they've been legally required to do so.

Ao3 is /for/ fans, and it's kind of specifically for fans who have or would be targeted in mass take-downs of material. That's part of why there's such a lot of slash on Ao3 in comparison to FFnet or other fanfiction archives. Although it's easier and easier in recent years to write M/M and F/F works without potentially facing TOS attacks, particularly across sites like Tumblr, Wattpad and the other most popular fansites of the youths these days (I don't know what sites they are and I don't want to lmao), Ao3 is still very much a "safe space" for them.

It's not /all/ slash. But like, if you ever sort of feel like going "ugh, why is there so much slash on Ao3", this is why.

You can read more about it on [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Archive_of_Our_Own][Fanlore]], which is also run by those that run Ao3, the Organisation for the Transformative Works.

** I use -"M/M" to filter, because -M/M also takes away F/M marked fics.

** There might be a better way than this, but you can type -m/m into the "search within results" bar on the side (after you have already searched by a tag ie. Harry Potter). That should filter out most of it as long as the author has tagged their stuff properly, some will still show up though. Hope this helps.

*** Even if it wasn't the dregs of the internet, it's search would still return a fuckload of results you don't want due to over tagging.

"Oh, I mention that this character was dating this other character, I only mention it once, they never actually show up in the story, better tag it"

As a result, even if you get results, more than half are irrelevant. You wanted, let's say, Katie Bell to be the MC? Well, authors tagged her in these 10,000 stories, so here are the 10,000 results, good luck with finding her as the MC.

There's a fine line between unable to find anything because I can't narrow it down further and I can't discard enough unwanted results to find jack shit. Ao3 is firmly in the latter part of that.

**** Biggest fault in Ao3, and a few other fanfic sites, is in allowing unlimited tags. Stories ought to be limited to say 5 tags. That way the author has to actually put some though into which tags BEST DESCRIBE his story.

Rather then just tag with everything in the hopes of tricking people who are not interested in his story to read it anyways.

*** So true. I have found a few good fics on there but it seems like most of the fics are written just so they can devolve into bad or kinky smut fics. Sorting by favorites which generally should give you something decent just returns some interesting results. I have even tried reading a few of the slash fics on there but all have just been so bad I have no idea why they are so popular.

There is just too many decent fics that start out fine but then the plot and good characterizations go away and it to turns into a multi or slash sex fic focused on OOC characters and crappy smut. There also seems to be quite a bit of torture or violence porn. It's a little ridiculous and I don't know how people find anything decent. It's great if you are feeling horny, but not for much else other than lots of frustration.

** I use AO3 when ff authors send me there for uncensored or MA fics that they can't post of FF. I gave up 10 minutes in the first time I tried the site because literally all I got was slash. You can never really tell anything about most fics because the tags are there to confuse you rather than help you.
