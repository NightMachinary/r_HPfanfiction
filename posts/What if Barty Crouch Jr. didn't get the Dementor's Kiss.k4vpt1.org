Let's say that Fudge didn't bring a Dementor with him to the interrogation of Crouch Jr. at the end of Goblet of Fire, and so Crouch Jr. was taken into custody to stand trial. What would happen during the trial and what would the fallout of it be?

I think on the Ministry's side, they'd have to deal with the fallout of Crouch Sr.'s unpleasant skeletons (that he broke his son out of Azkaban and then used the Imperius Curse to place him under house arrest for 12 years), which in turn might taint a lot of the other convictions that went through the Council of Magical Law while he was head of the DMLE (Sirius's most notably) if a pattern gets established. Fudge would also have no way of denying that Voldemort was back thanks to Crouch Jr.'s own testimony (even if Fudge doesn't personally believe it, it would be in his best interests to have the matter investigated, to confirm it for himself. He's an egotistical man, but by that reason he should know he has a lot to gain, politically speaking, by putting all his effort on managing the situation of Voldemort's return).

Beyond that, I'm not sure what other fallout would happen if Crouch Jr. stood trial instead of getting the Demontor's Kiss. Thoughts?


** You are assuming he gets a trial though. If there was no Kiss, the first thing I'd think happens is that Barty gets shipped back to Azkaban no questions asked, the stated reason being he broke out and now he's back, the end.

The actual reason being precisely what you say -- a trial creates all sorts of headaches for all sorts of people, and if Fudge can order a trial for Harry, he can also not order a trial for Barty.

If there /was/ a trial, I believe there is a strong likelihood Fudge's administration topples. It's the kind of scandal that forces resignations all over the place. As we see in HBP, Fudge /is/ beholden to the public, and your own administration head secretly breaking his Dark Wizard son out of prison isn't the sort of thing you can shrug off.

But then again, see above; that's precisely the reason why there is every incentive in the world to stay away from a trial as far as possible (and better yet, shut Barty up for good, which is what happens in GoF).

*** I agree with this. Shipped to Azkaban at once.

Though it is weird this didn't get more problems for Fudge. Even if he was kissed, there was no denying he escaped. That should have hit the paper, shouldn't it?

** He would be shipped to Azkaban, but he would also be saying Voldemort has returned. Which could easily be passed off as part of his insanity. Fudge also wouldn't let anyone visit his cell to ask him questions. He would break out of Azkaban during the mass breakout. We don't really know what his skills are, but from what we know I'd say he's good at: Dueling, the cruciatus curse, raw magical power, high intelligence, potions, and a fanatic loyalty to Voldemort whom he would gladly give up his soul to(even though his prompt is based on the idea that he doesn't). So I'd say he would definitely go on raids, and maybe more people would die because of this. Because he's barely in the series, one could also create a fanon personality of what special ability he gives to the death eaters. Maybe he likes to torture people for fun and a lot more people are insane in this timeline. Maybe he studied divination and declared the prophecy fulfilled on October 31st, 1980. And because the prophecy is fufilled, he tries to recruit Harry Potter as he's the only death eater with a non-biased account of his personality. Maybe the whole divergence is him escaping before the dementors kiss, so he just goes on a killing spree around Britain without worrying of revealing Voldemort.
