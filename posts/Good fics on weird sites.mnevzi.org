Hello

I`m looking for good completed fics that aren`t on ao3 or [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] and SIYE. Probably you know some of them which aren`t there but are worth reading.

- No slash

- The longer fic, the better for me

- Preferably with Harry as MC, but it can also be about Marauders/Lily era or Next Generation


** As a matter of fact, I do:

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/enter-the-dragon-harry-potter-shadowrun.7861/reader]]

There is a fic with the same name and premise in ffa, but it's an old one. This one's (I think) an adoption of it and is much bigger.

Harry becomes a bloody dragon at age 8. Super Intelligence included. Unfortunately for him, super intelligence does not mean super maturity.

This fic has a collection of extremely unique characterisations and very interesting (and mature) world building.

** Don't have a link on hand, but it's been posted a ton of times here so I don't think you'll have much trouble finding it.

It's from Space battles, a fic about Harry having a secret dream vacation home type list, and drops it in Diagon Alley. The shopkeepers and whatnot find it, and create it, bigger on the inside trunk style, as a pendant and gives it to him.

Sadly was abandoned, last I heard.

*** So you don't have a link, but the premise sounds interested. How about a little help?

Is Space battles the author? Part of the title? A cross-over genre? An archive site that I've never heard of? Are there actual battles in space (because that's all I found when I searched the sub for space battles)?

** [[https://www.sugarquill.net][www.sugarquill.net]] is a pretty old site, it's not updated any longer but pretty much everything on there is good because they had actual standards of grammar and spelling for everything posted, with "editors" who would review new fics as quality control before posting. A lot of their stuff is pretty fascinating because it was written pre-OOTP when nobody knew how the series was going to end, but still was expected to be canon compliant.
