Watched the movie a week ago and was just thinking about how cool it would be to sub Pennywise in for the Basilisk.

Anyway the rest of this is just some crap about how it could go if Pennywise is in the chamber, if you want that idea go for it.

Like maybe Salazar sacrificed himself to seal it in there and the other founders lied so nobody would go looking for it.

Just picture this for a moment, Riddle has finally opened the chamber the pipe is open, and then... [[https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/bIE1SB9oqYlOHXjWDgjITg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NTAwO2g9MzAz/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/3cd105a5bd145cb0bf6d1d1d5c12323e][Boom!]]

Tom's not stupid, he runs. From here on out it would be murky. Does he make it? Maybe. If he does does he rally his nascent Death Eaters once people start vanishing? Do the teachers give a shit?

Hell, that could all be a prologue the story could be set 30 years later, coincidentally Harry's parents would be in their first few years at Hogwarts around then.


** I thought this exact thing when I saw IT as well. I really hope someone writes one, crack or otherwise. [[/spoiler][When we see Bev wake up in the Chamber of Sewers My friend shouted "It's Ginny Weasley!"]]

** opopanax has written some Stephen King crossovers/adaptations, although they haven't attempted anything involving "IT" yet. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10384704/1/Black-Serendipity][Black Serendipity]] is an adaptation of "Apt Pupil", and the latest oneshot in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6641527/21/In-the-Realms-of-the-Opopanax][this collection]] features elements of "Pet Sematary".

Other than that, this fic from two weeks ago is the only crossover I've been able to find, although given the movie's popularity, I expect the floodgates will open to more crossovers soon:

** Obviously a Potterverse version of it would be some sort of really powerful Boggart. Maybe one of those "Blood-Sucking Bugbears" Hagrid talked about once.
