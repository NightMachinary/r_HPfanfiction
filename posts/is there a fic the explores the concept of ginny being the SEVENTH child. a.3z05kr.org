** Interesting idea. I've seen 7th child mentioned in passing to explain her power but not used for a main hook.

** Spoilers for [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance][/Resonance trilogy/]] (W: 1,713,423; Abandoned) --- up to book 3, chapter 33.

--------------

In this story prophecies are actively self-fulfilling: they act like memetic viruses to change the behaviour and actions of those who have heard them to ensure their fulfilment. And since Harry also gradually develops dimension-travelling abilities here, he unknowingly transports some of those prophecy-viruses from one dimension to another by being their carrier --- the person who has heard them in their original dimension and gave them power in the new one where he travelled to.

One of such prophecies is woven around “seventh pureblood son who is not”, which applies to Ginny.

#+begin_quote
  Two short stories of Harry Potter with one question: what if a witch had instead been born a wizard, or vice versa? Male Ginny and Female Remus each star in their own story of a single change and the difference it makes. Canon compliant soft AU, with a single character changing sex and gender in each story.

** I've read a ton of Ginny-centric fics. I've seen it mentioned in some of them to explain her power, but not one of them have it as part of the main focus.

** I've read one where it was mentioned and used. I think it was on potions and snitches. Alas I can't seem to remember the name.
