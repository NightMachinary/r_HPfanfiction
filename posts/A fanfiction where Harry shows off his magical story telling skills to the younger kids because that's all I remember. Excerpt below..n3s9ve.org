:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
And oh do they adore just how he tells them. Weaving images with his magic was something Harry had originally learned to do to entertain Teddy. Now, he uses it to illustrate his tales.

‚ÄúOnce a basilisk lived in a forest filled to the brim,

With Pixies, with Nifflers, with Gnomes and with Grimm,

It was hatched there to guard, to protect and defend,

And the basilisk did, even as he longed for a friend. 

The creatures were scared to approach him, he could kill with a glance!

Even the serpents fled before him, terrified to give him a chance. 

 

So the basilisk grew lonely as it protected its home,

Attacks came from poachers unwilling to let creatures rome. 

But the basilisk, unlike he was made to do,

Never looked upon the intruders. Instead he took them and threw!

In his strength there was magic, and when he tossed people away,

They were spared from death---unless they again sought out prey.‚Äù

Harry's projection shows a hunter sneak through the other side of the forest. He took aim at a thestral, and the moment his bow released the arrow disintegrated. So did the man.  

His listeners murmur, but settle quickly as he begins to speak again.

‚ÄúStories were whispered from person to person; 

Something worth killing for caused interest in the Forest to worsen. 

A man came forth, determined to reveal the lands riches,

The basilisk tossed him away too, drawing the attention of a coven of witches. 

‚ÄòMonster!' They shrieked, wands in hand, taking shots.

Spells splashed over its hide; hot, burning spots. 

There was a solution so simple to make the agony stop,

He need only open his eyes, and dead, they would drop. 

 

Instead the basilisk showed mercy, again and again,

The witches were tossed away, as were many more men,

The cycle was never ending; there was no peace to be found,

More magicals came, in search of treasure profound.

 

One day a wizard appeared of notable renowned,

A parselmouth, sure that he could talk the basilisk around. 

‚ÄòGreetings, King of Serpents, show me to your gold,

I am a Speaker, so obey me: show me wonders untold!'

 

For the first time someone spoke to the basilisk without calling it a beast,

But it was confounded, for there were no wonders to be released. 

He explained to the Speaker that there was no such treasure,

And the Speaker hissed an incantation in parseltongue to show his displeasure. 

Unlike normal spells, which skimmed off his thick hide,

This one twisted through his skin and caused pain that would not subside!"

Some of Harry's audience gasp in outrage, and he spares them a brief smile as the image of the pale basilisk begins to darken ominously. The wound to his underside was pitch black, with veins branching off of it like poison.

‚Äú‚ÄòI should kill him,' thinks the Basilisk, full of anger and spite. 

How was it always he forced into a fight?!

He longed only for peace, for comfort, for friends!

But his wishes were for naught; inevitably, his patience ends.‚Äù

Harry makes a slashing motion with his wand. The children cry out as the wizard is taken into the basilisks mouth, though some seem to be cheering the basilisk on. 

‚ÄúHe grips the wizards robes tight between ginormous teeth, 

He longs to dig in, capitulate to his malice, to eat,

But something within him protests fervently:

‚ÄòTruly, a killer, is that what you wish to be?'

The children hush as the severity of the situation sets in.

The basilisk hesitates and the wizard strikes;

A spell shoots down his innards; agony spikes!

The wizard did not think a beast capable of feeling;

He cast another spell, unaware of the goodwill he was stealing.

‚ÄòIf a monster I am, if it's all that they'll see,

I shall kill this wretch and let them forsake me!'

The basilisk bursts into flames, and the wizard burns with it. The image flickered in an imitation of fire, before extinguishing and taking the light of the room with it. 

Everything was still, as if the world was holding its breath. Harry's voice shattered the hush, tone softer, now, but no less powerful. 

‚ÄúWhat is a monster but a being of our own making?

A consequence of selfishness, never giving, always taking;

We take from Lady Magic, from each other, from the wood;

And sometimes we take something precious: the good.‚Äù

***** Nope. I don't read anything with the epilogue ending to it so you won't find it there. I mostly read slash so there is a high possiblity that it's an m/m fic.

****** Is it possible that it's a Harrymort fanfiction? Because I recall one where Harry went back in time and verbally sparred with the horcruxes through verses, and this seems to possibly be from there.

Sadly, it's yet to be finished.
