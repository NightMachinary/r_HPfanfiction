Recently I've been having a lot more difficulty finding good fics with pairings I like or that don't have them. Everything else I see rec'd tends to be for ships I usually outright hate but others love, like Snarry. Given this, I figured I should at least try to find some subset of those types of fics I might enjoy and see if that branches out to more stories to read.

I don't like the idea of Snarry normally, mostly because Snape is far too bitter as an adult and because of the obvious age gap. Decided time travel fics might have some kind of remedy for that. If you have any recs for stories where Harry goes back in time and he and Snape become either incredibly close friends or straight up a couple, please shoot 'em my way. Might as well give the ship a chance in some capacity, yeah? Any time during Snapes school years is cool as well. Younger Snape traveing forwards in time and meeting Harry is also welcome.


** Well, there is Gray Skye Mourning linkffn(8315797).

Harry does go back in time, but there might be a part that deals with him coming back to the present, I can't recall precisely. I do know that it is an emotional fic and that I loved it.

*** I just came here to rec this same fic! I think that its a little too emo in some parts but overall a good fic and it gives a lot of great backstory for why Snape is such a HUGE dick in canon. Also theres a lot of cool care of magical creatures world building.

  When Harry is accidentally sent back to Hogwarts 1982, he discovers a more bitter and angrier Snape than he knew in his school years. Tasked by Dumbledore with teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts and befriending Snape, as well as finding out how to get back, Harry knows he is in store for a difficult year. Despite their arguing, Harry can't help but find himself drawn to Snape. If Harry and Snape can get over their past and learn to be just a little selfish, their relationship may stand a chance.

** I haven't read many, but *Rapture* by Mia Ugly is the best fic of this trope/pairing I've read so far. In fact, I was like you, not quite sold on the Snarry pairing but after reading this story, I have definitely decided to give Snarry a closer look.
