Since I do have an account, if my mind starts racing with ideas I might end up writing it myself, but that would probably be a bad idea as I happen to get really into things only to stop them immediately and then resume them later.

Moving in, what about a fanfic where the Wizarding World becomes a "Super" World? and changes events into that. For instance

Harry's Parents: Superheroes who preceded Harry and died in a climactic final battle with their arch nemesis, Voldemort, and who inspire Harry to become a superhero himself.

Harry: An idealistic kid who becomes inspired by his parents to take up their mantle and fight crime.

Ron: A kid who befriends Harry and ends up taking the mantle, after some persuasion, as a superhero

And lastly, Hermione: Probably an Oracle type character, who does all the research, though she wouldn't be crippled unless it happens late story or..something else

Anyways these are just ideas, if you have any of your own (Like Villains, The Dursleys other heroes etc.) leave them in the comments

So a world where some people are born with unique superpowers and join a secret world where they learn to make the maximum use of their powers and make friends with other people like themselves?

I assume you want this to be alternate-reality Harry Potter, right? Not a crossover with Marvel Comics or Sky High or such?

I wonder, how would the pureblood/muggleborn dynamic play out, though? What would make Voldemort exceptionally vile, and give him the capability to return from death? How would the Super-World be covered up if magic isn't present and therefore memory charms aren't around (neuralizer technology, maybe?)? What would be found in ancient egyptian tombs?

*** Even if a character did possess magic it wouldn't be in a standardized form i.e. proper wand movement and spell name.Also would there be wands at all?

*** A superhero AU would probably not have an equivalent to the statute of secrecy.

** Not sure if its worth the effort making it an AU over just making it a crossover with something like Worm.
