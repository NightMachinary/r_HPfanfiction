As the title says. I'm just diving into the world of fan fiction and am about to read Dumbledore's Army and The Year Of Darkness.

Any other good canon-compliant fan fic? I'm sure this has been asked all the time. :)


** NO! This story is just masquerading as canon-compliant, but it's full of OOC developments and implausible plot devices [[/spoiler][Snape sending Neville/Ginny/Luna to be killed by werewolves in the Forbidden Forest?! Victor Krum saving Neville from ministry execution chamber?!]]

If you like year 7 actions at Hogwarts, you are much better off reading *Not From Others*, linkffn(11419408), by [[/u/FloreatCastellum]]

*Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince*, linkffn(5677867), is an excellent year 6 fic from Ginny's POV.

For postwar canon-compliant fics, you may want to check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian's]] story series. *Grave Days*, linkffn(5486257), happened immediately after the final battle. *Strangers at Drakeshaugh*, linkffn(6331126), is his best story and happened in year 2010.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4772789/1/Six_Years_Six_Applicants]]) is a short little story with one chapter per year, that tells us about Dumbledore's interviews to fullfill the post of DADA. A certain character applies every year, hopeful. No prize for guessing which one.

[[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2023&chapno=1][Mind's eye, Soul's reflection]] is a lovely story that attempts to write the fifth year via Luna's POV: Unfortunately, it's canon compliance falls short simply due to the fact that it was written before HBP came out. Still a very good story.

Inquisitor already Suggested GW and the Half Blood prince and Strangers at Drakeshaugh, and I'll add my support to those choices.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/]]) Hogwrts houses divided is set in 10 years after the battle of Hogwarts, following Teddy Lupin and 3 OCs on their first year. If you want to be strict, it doesn't follow canon simply because Teddy Lupin is ment t be a Hufflepuff (JK has said so), and this story puts him in a diferent house (even though itwas written before JKR said it). It also suffers a bit from trying to tell the story from several characters' POV, and making the transicton between them a bit awkward at times, but I think those are all things that can be looked past.

Non canon fics that I would recomend to anyone are Oh God Not Again linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again]]) and Seventh Horcrux linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux]]) which are bot simply hilarious and a good way to spend the afternoon.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

** I'd still recommend reading DAYD. It's controversial and met with mixed reactions, but I enjoyed it the first time. It wasn't until I re-read it that I started to pick apart the problems with it.

I second the recommendations for Not From Others and anything by Northumbrian. I'd also recommend:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1536120/1/Secrets][Secrets by Elizabeth Culmer]] It's Chamber of Secrets from Ginny's POV. I believe it's this month's book club too.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4800046/1/The-Unwinding-Of-Percy-Weasley][The Unwinding of Percy Weasley by JustAudrey07]] It's post-Hogwarts, and how Percy met his wife, Audrey.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9080959/1/Dumbledore-s-Army-and-the-Casualties-of-War][Dumbledore's Army and the Causalties of War by PJHope]] It's written in a different POV each chapter and deals with the DA and their recovery the summer after the BOH. It's a WIP.
