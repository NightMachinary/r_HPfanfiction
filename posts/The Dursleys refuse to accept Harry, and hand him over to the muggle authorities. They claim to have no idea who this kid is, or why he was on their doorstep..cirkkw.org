** Lol i read your prompt weird. I thought you meant the muggle authorities claimed they had no idea who the kid was and why he was on their doorstep.

I am just picturing the British version of cops like Reno 911 or Brooklyn 99 cops raising Harry.

Beat Cop: Hey Sgt this baby was left on the front steps what should we do with it.\\
Sgt: I am not sure let me ask the chief.

Sgt: Hey chief what do you do with babies?\\
Chief: You raise them, why are you asking?\\
Sgt: Oh no reason.

Sgt: Hey guys Chief says we have to raise him, someone clean out Cell #3 and use the precincts card to buy a crib.

Ehh that is a slight misunderstanding of how it works over there. Its really hard to get a pistol but long arms, especially shotguns are not super difficult to get. You just have to show you have a need for one (such as hunting,collecting or work related), have your doctors say you are not nuts and prove you can safely store a firearm.

It is even easier in Northern Ireland to get one [[https://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/northern-ireland][where around 1 out of 20 people have firearms]]. They just need to prove to the gun store that they can be trusted with a firearm (they just make sure you know its not a toy) and fill out a permit but self defense counts as a legitimate reason if it seems reasonable so they are fairly easy to get.

Per Wikipedia [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimated_number_of_civilian_guns_per_capita_by_country][the UK has around 3,242,000 firearms in civilian hands]] as of 2017. Most of the licensed ones are shotguns as they are much easier to get a license for.

Basically if you want a firearm in the UK [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearms_regulation_in_the_United_Kingdom#Licensing_of_firearms][you have to go to your local police and fill in paperwork for either a 5-year firearm certificate or a shotgun certificate]] .

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

**** That's right, but Dumbledore would most likely notice that it was never actually finalized. I don't agree with [[/u/-Oc-]] on what he'd do about it (I prefer my Dumbledores with stricter ethics), but he'd definitely do /something/ rather than leave Harry in the hands of Muggle Social Services.

(Unless maybe he was placed in a family who already had a Muggleborn? But I don't think placements would happen that fast, and if so it'd just become another of the stories where Harry's raised with the Grangers / Thomases / Finch-Fletchleys / etc.)

They pretty much do. Problematic though Surrey County Council Childrens' Services were during the relevant period (underfunded enough that they failed to spot that one of their residential care homes had an actual paedophile on staff) they have the same roster of emergency foster carers that any other County Childrens' Services department would, and access to the same fostering agencies - mostly charitable concerns, the big one at the time was Barnardo's - and toddlers are easy to place since you don't have to worry about them having challenging behavioural issues.

The result is that Harry is given a new name and placed with a family somewhere in the suburbs of Woking or Guildford and has a perfectly normal childhood. More social worker visits than other kids - the fostering agencies maintain their own staff of social workers - maybe a foster-sibling or two (whether other fostered kids or his foster-parents' own children), he may even end up adopted by his foster-parents. I went to school with a chap whose home situation was exactly this.

***** I don't believe a more ethical Dumbledore would put Harry with any Muggleborn families who don't already have or had a child in Hogwarts. Does he even know which children actually have magic until the letter is sent out? He might try to reason with Petunia to get her to accept Harry, but assuming that fails for whatever reason, it leads to some very interesting predicaments. There's Remus who would need to be constantly monitored, there's Sirius if Dumbledore actually investigates more thoroughly, there's some other Order member who might be willing, some Muggleborn families might accept, but there's problems with that, or perhaps he could take care of Harry himself. Regardless of what avenue is chosen, there's certainly some problems, but that's why fanfiction exists: to explore them.

  Canon Divergence AU  Dumbledore raises Harry from the age of four after the Dursleys are found to be unfit guardians. They live in relative isolation, away from the pressures and dangers of the wizarding world, until Harry turns eleven. Then they return to Hogwarts together in the role of headmaster and student.Nothing has changed except for Harry and Dumbledore and what they mean to each other. And that changes everything.
