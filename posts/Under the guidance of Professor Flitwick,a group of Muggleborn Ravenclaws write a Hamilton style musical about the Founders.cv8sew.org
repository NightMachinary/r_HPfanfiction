** ...going by syllable counts, pretty sure it's gonna have to be about Slytherin to keep the same meter.

** Godric Gryffindor: How does a bastard, orphan, son of a Muggle / and a Spaniard, dropped in the middle of a forgotten / Spot in the British Isles by Providence, / impoverished, in squalor Grow up to be a villain and a scholar?

Helga Hufflepuff: The two-sickle Founding Father without a father / Got a lot farther by spellin' a lot harder / By bein' a lot smarter / By bein' a self-starter / By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a long wizarding line

Rowena Ravenclaw: And every day while wizards were being slaughtered and burned / At the stake, drowned or stoned, he struggled and kept his guard up / Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of / The founder was ready to curse, steal, borrow, or barter

.... And that's about all my brain will come up with at the moment. Fun, but Slytherin is really no Hamilton for me.

*** Then the witch hunts came and devastation reigned/Our founders saw their future drip drippin down the drain/Put a sharp quill to their temple/Connected it their brain/Then they started their campaign/To start a school in their name///Then the word got around/ They said “their magic is insane, man”/ Took up a collection so that they could buy some farmland/ To give an education, disregarding all their fame/And the worlds gonna know the name/ What's the name, man!/Hoggy Warty Hogwarts/Its name is Hoggy Warty Hogwarts/and there's a million wards to be put up/Just you wait/Just you wait.... Why did I spend my time doing this lmao
