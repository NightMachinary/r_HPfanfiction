So I was commenting in another post about Lily's sacrifice and I wondered...exactly how does Dumbledore know that Voldemort offered Lily a chance to step aside? He says it enough times, that Lily cast her life as a shield, but...how does he know that that's how it happened?

The only people present at the Potter's Cottage were James, Lily, Voldemort and a one-year old Harry. James and Lily are dead, so they're not telling him anything, and Harry is a toddler barely able to speak, let alone understand stuff, and Voldemort is certainly not telling anyone. Voldemort himself finds out the reason behind his defeat when he asks Harry in the Chamber of Secrets.

So, how on earth does Dumbledore know what happened? Sure, Albus knows Snivellus begged Voldemort to spare Lily's life, but he's got no way of knowing whether Voldemort humoured that plea. I mean, Voldemort could just as easily have fired a Killing Curse straight up without pausing to mock Lily.

This is one of those cases where there's a giant Manipulative!Dumbledore vibe going on.


** Dumbledore mentioned that magic always leaves traces, so he probably realized what kind of magic was used. Considering the circumstances he could probably easily deduce what happened there.

#+begin_quote
  ‘How did you know that was there?' Harry asked in astonishment.

  ‘Magic always leaves traces,' said Dumbledore, as the boat hit the bank with a gentle bump, ‘sometimes very distinctive traces. I taught Tom Riddle. I know his style.'

** Given the presence of things like Time-Turners, priori incantatem, and the entire field of divination in canon, it's not really a stretch to think that there is magic designed for determining what happened at a location in the recent past.

*** Time-turners? If that were the case, Voldemort would never have seen the outside world after he killed Myrtle. Not to mention every other criminal. It's so weird - a case of Rowling making an incredibly powerful device for use as a plot device without actually thinking about the consequences of such a device existing.

Priori Incantatem works with wands, and it just shows the effects of the past spells. Conversations aren't a part of that.

Divination...yes, it's there, but if the other practitioners of it are so hopeless that Trelawney is accepted as teacher, that doesn't speak much for their ability.

**** Trelawney was never hired because of her ability to teach. Like Snape, she was hired to keep her in Hogwarts, where Dumbledore could keep an eye on her.

Trelawney only every seemed to talk about using Divination to see the future. My headcanon is that the future can only be seen by someone with the gift for it, but the past/other locations in the same time, can be seen by people who have the knowledge and skill to do so. Dumbledore is shown, especially in the earlier books, having powers and knowledge that seem esoteric or useless at first glance. Being able to replay a scene from the recent past would fit in with his other skills.

***** No, what I meant was that practitioners of Divination had been so poor that Albus is literally scraping the barrel by the time he interviews Trelawney.

****** No. It was that Dumbledore didn't think there were anybody who were actual seers. But he noted Trelawney's name and considered the possibility of her being related to another Trelawney that was her great-grandmother(?) and he did end up seeing her perform a prophecy. If neither one happend, odds are he'd have skipped it over.

****** This is a logical deduction from what the books provide, but that doesn't mean it's true. It could also be true that there were several competent Divination Studies candidates, Dumbledore only interviewed Trelawney on the strength of her name recognition, and he hired her solely because she spoke a Prophecy in front of him.

**** It's not about those specific practices but the implications they have for the wider field of magic. We don't see every possible tool available to witches and wizards in the books.

** I think Dumbledore, a legilimens, read Harry's mind to get the memory.

*** It's definitely possible, but Legilimency doesn't really work like mind reading though - Dumbledore can't just read his memories. He can see or divine Harry's thoughts, but a one year old could be thinking of all manner of things.

A one year old's thoughts might not even be all that solid in the first place, because Snape can only see flashes of memories from a fifteen, nearly sixteen year old Harry.

There's also the fact that Legilimency is quite painful. When Dumbledore apparently does use Legilimency on Harry, he feels as though his brain is being ransacked. Not sure that canon-good Albus will be up for doing that to a one year old.

**** Is there evidence in canon that legilimency doesn't include the reading of memories, just thoughts? Stuff like [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Legilimency][this]] says it can include the reading of memories, if the practitioner is skilled.

The memory certainly would have been in there. One-year-olds can remember things, understand language, and talk a little.

***** Memories are read in canon - most of Snape's sessions with Harry have him seeing flashes of Harry's past. But still, a one year old's memories...

The wiki has some random stuff thrown about. For instance, when Voldemort in his baby form is talking to Frank Bryce, he's not using Legilimency because he's not even facing him. Eye contact is required for legilimency (or so it's implied), and there was no way Voldemort was able to see Harry from the inside of Quirrel's turban either.

******** He remembers them enough for the Dementors to bring up the full and complete memory over a decade later. If weird, negative emotion Dementor magic can bring up that memory, it stands to reason that a very powerful wizard skilling in Legilimency like Dumbledore ought to be able to do the same mere hours after the event in question.

****** Does saying "He lies!" while under the turban mean anything to you? Voldemort can use legilimency without needing eye contact.

** Because James obviously died trying to buy them time, Lily is dead next to the crib, Dumbledore knows Lily and James well enough to know that they /would/ sacrifice their lives for their kid if they had the option, and Snape tells Dumbledore that Voldemort agreed to give Lily a chance to step aside as a reward to Snape.

Plus, Harry survived the Killing Curse, and Dumbledore recognized the magic of the blood protection.

** Dumbledore doesn't know what happened.\\
But he is an intelligent man, with a deep understanding of magic (he knows that words and acts and symbols have power), the capacity to accurately guess Voldemort thought process, and hints thanks to Snape.\\
He knows that Snape begged for Lily's life, he knows that Voldemort agreed, he knows that the magic that was woven around Harry was not just the result of a mother fighting for or sacrificing itself for her child. He knows that Lily didn't have her wand, he knows her enough to accurately guess that she would offer her life for her son's.\\
Voldemort made and broke a deal with Snape (explicit "spare Lily and I will serve"), he made a deal with Lily (implicit "my life for my son's") and tried to break it, hell he may even have made and broke a deal with wormtail ("please spare James": that would take us back to the power of numbers).
