I must begin with a confession; I have a major weakness for Lord Hadrian Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Hufflepuff-Ravenclaw-Slytherin-Peverell. It's kind of like an addiction to jelly doughnuts; over the top and extremely unhealthy, but oh-so-goooood. That being said, there is something that I rarely see in these fics, and that is Harry's position being treated seriously.

The Wizarding community of Great Britain is a small, close knit community. The Wizengamot, as described in canon, is NOT a massive group; the majority of them fit into a large, but not massive, courtroom. As such, Hadrian Dozen-Hyphenated-Names is a voting bloc all to himself. That is a major problem; pretty much every law they want to pass, every trial they preside over, is going to involve a one-man quorum. If he wants to make a motion, he can make it and carry it without anyone else's support. Harry will be constantly hounded by literally everyone who wants support for their position, as his vote alone will represent a huge percentage point of the majority.

Now, I'm not really well versed in parliamentary procedures or whatever the hell the Wizengamot is supposed to be, but I can only imagine that Harry Fills-An-Entire-Page walking into Wizengamot chambers would constitute an utter flustercluck for any sort of normal business was supposed to happen that session.


** Okay some points:

1. I respect you liking this
2. That being said Hadrian Potter-Black-Pendragon-Peverell-Trump-Musoullini-Skywalker-Pokemon earl of Windex... Sucks
3. As far as I know Wizengamot is small but at least 50 members. For Hadrian Potter-Black-Kardashian-Tamagoshi to be a one man senate, he needs to have at least 26 last names hyphenated
4. Even so. I don't think people naming guys to the Wizengamot are stupid. This boy, supposing he gets granted a seat at 11, is only getting one seat, for he only has one arse.
5. Wizengamot seems to pick member by nominating or electing people, then some sort of approval... Wish I imagine values last names... However there are no seats reserved for families. Otherwise Lucius would be there.
6. So if he gets elected, Hadrian Potter-Black-Malfoy-Bones-Harems-Shaquilonile would be the most pretentious little shit there. But he would still have a single vote
7. That being said. You are writing a fanfic and if you want to make every one at the Wizengamot stupid and have Hadrian Potter-Black-Granger-Riverdell-Elendil-McClane-Zwanzeneger laughing maniacally as he outsmarts easily and makes the whole Ministry his bitches. You can. And you will have an audience for that.

*** 1. Very thoughtful reply
2. Canon doesn't really specify whether the Wizengamot seats are hereditary, elected, or appointed. Considering how backwards and screwed up magical society seems to be...
3. Even if he's not a one man senate, he's still a pretty sizeable percentage. If the Wizengamot is 50 seats, and Harry is Potter-Black-Founders (a fairly common fanfiction setup), that's 12% of the votes.
4. If he can't use all 6 seats at once, what prevents him from parceling them out to proxies? Again, I know nothing about parliamentary procedures, especially the screwed up pseudo-parliament that the Wizengamot masquerades as.

**** We have no canon specific info about how are the members are picked, but we do get a glimpse at how they are NOT picked. Automatic seats granted to members based on last name and no one being able to remove them because of magical contract jada jada... Is not viable in canon.

The Ministry was able to remove Dumbledore and restore him easily. So the Ministry has power over the election of members. Dumbledore is a family is hard to picture in the top 50 families, given that it is not part of the 28 and there are others which are many others not in the 28 which seem to be regarded as more pure than Dumbledore. Dumbledore himself seems to have been elected on merit for defeating Grindelwald, not hereditary, because he was not in the Wizengamot in fantastic beasts. Also, Lucius as I said is not in the Wizengamot.

That being said, you can do things outside of canon.

***** I would just like to point out Dumbledore's position of Chief Warlock was more similar to the Speaker of the House, with Fudge being like a Primer Minister.

Dumbledore's seat in the Wizengamot is different than the rest.

I can see them having Chamber-of-Lords-before-reforms membership along with some elected or appointed members, one of the most plausible forms I saw was one where they had inherited seats, elected seats, and seats occupied by high-level government officials(Department Directors) along with having Legislative power that wasn't as dependent on Fudge's Executive or Madam Bone's Judiciary.

The truth of the matter is, as I always said, JKR didn't set up anything more detailed, and the Wizengamot is only mentioned in context with Dumbledore and/or Harry's trial.

So I think if people are consistent and smart about it you can make it into a mixture between the Parliament and a standard Magical Council.

We don't even know how elections happen, or who is/isn't elected.

****** For the non-Anglophiles (including yours truly), what reforms to the House of Lords are you referring to? My knowledge of British history is rather minimal.

******* I am not a specialist too, but from what I could gather, they were basically all hereditary seats(like hundreds of years ago) of powerful(as in lots of land and/or money) Lords, so it was similar to what some people depict the Wizengamot to be like.

Then came in the Chamber of Commons and all the other reforms to make it more democratic. Though IIRC there are still some very few hereditary seats.

******** 92 out of 797 seats in the House of Lords are hereditary.

Which probably qualifies as more "some very few"

********* I was talking more about both Chambers combined.

But still going from 100% to not even 20% is a big reduction.

** I remember reading a fic where Harry was given absolute power over wizarding Britain for the entirety of his life, but because he united the Hallows he became immortal, and he never used his powers. Then, several decades later, he decided to send his first law - it was quite funny and it didn't take itself seriously, it was a twoshot if I remember correctly.
