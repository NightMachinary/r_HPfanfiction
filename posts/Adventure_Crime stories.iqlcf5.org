:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Im relatively new to the whole fanfic-scene and am really enjoying it right now. However I feel like most of them are weird ships or kinda cliché cringy romantic stories. Is there maybe a fanfic that starts shortly after book 7 that is about Harry's career as an auror? Don't mind the occasional romance but I'd I'm kinda done with a traumatised Harry that only gets injured to move some romantic plot along.

I'm guessing that there should be loads and that I just don't know where to look.


** linkffn(Hunters and Prey by Northumbrian) linkao3(Hollow Ash by FloreatCastellum)

These are two that I enjoyed that I believe fulfill the criteria.

*** Thanks for the rec!

OP, you would need to read linkao3(The Aurors by FloreatCastellum) before Hollow Ash :)

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially not one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...

  When a mysterious woman comes to the Auror office claiming to be the victim of a terrible crime, Theia and Harry want to do everything they can to help her. The problem is, she has no memory of what has happened. As they piece together the sinister events, their own troubles and traumas rise to the surface, causing them to question who they really are. Sequel to The Aurors.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13275002/1/][The Imposter Complex]] is all about crime and adventure but it features Diary!Tom. It's pretty good.

** Not an auror, but this is my favorite post-Hogwarts story. Features Harry as sort of private detective and problem fixer. linkffn(Wizard for Hire by Dark-Syaoran)

Abandoned unfortunately.

** I usually suggest stories by [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]] (start with “Tales of the Battle” and go on; you can return later to the earlier stories) to be great introduction to the Harry Potter fanfiction world. And yes, there are plenty of non-Romantic stories, or at least they happen after the book story is finished, so they just have to be original.
