*** Lol good read. If I remember right though the amount of efforts he puts into being lazy kinda makes him the least lazy person in whole school :D

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

** Canon? - Yes, I think Harry is incredibly lazy and very seldom pro-active (he doesn't actually go looking for trouble most of the time, it just finds him and he's always ill prepared and muddles through on luck, chance, plot-armor and the sacrifice of others!) in canon, so IMHO canon fulfills your request quite nicely (best example of this: The Patronus, his one great achievement - he only learns it because the damned Dementors interrupt his damned quidditch matches (!)) because Harry often seems as if he couldn't care less! His life isn't worth fighting for and training (I am not expecting him to become the second comming of Merlin - not that such fictions aren't cool every once in a while and a kind of guilty pleasure of mine - but I'd like it if he researched magic from countries Voldemort has NOT visited (if he has not been there, then chances are he CAN'T COUNTER IT!))

He has no ambition, no goals (he kind of has accepted that Voldemort will kill him, so no need to apply himself - right?), no passions (other than quidditch, but not even that, after all he does NOT go pro after Hogwarts!) :(

*** No he doesn't and the teaching that he enjoyed and was good at in the DA doesn't get pursued because he follows the idea of being an auror that just popped into his head in a careers interview. Despite the corruption he's seen in the ministry. Despite never really managing silent casting. And despite never showing great regard for rules and regs.

Oh, and he become head of the office... somehow. Then has a bunch of kids with a fangirl having made no effort to pro-actively date. Lazy doesn't even begin to describe it.

*** Yes, canon Harry was very passive and only reacted whatever got thrown at him. In addition to what you said, he had no plan and no strategy (Ron's accusation in the Tent was actually spot on) for the Horcrux hunt, he even forgot to ask Dumbledore how to destroy one.

Beginning Year 6, when Voldemort came into the open and he knew the real game, he disbanded and slacked off much to Neville and Luna's disappointment. Well, he could at least use some of his temporary favor with the Ministry to have the Trace for him and his friends revoked.
