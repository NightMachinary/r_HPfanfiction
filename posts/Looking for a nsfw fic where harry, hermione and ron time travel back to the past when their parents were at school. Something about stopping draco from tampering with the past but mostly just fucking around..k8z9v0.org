** Linkffn(the legacy of Hogwarts) harry ron hermione luna and ginny get sent back after special objects because draco was sent back by Voldemort. They go to 77 and basically its heavy on the free love sentiment of the time period. Pretty sure this is the one you're thinking of

  Each generation of Hogwarts brings a fresh crop of promising new wizards and witches. But, unbeknownst to us, my generation would be the stuff of legends. I am Mary MacDonald, the only one still alive from the Hogwarts class of 1978. So it falls on me to tell you all the stories of my peers.
