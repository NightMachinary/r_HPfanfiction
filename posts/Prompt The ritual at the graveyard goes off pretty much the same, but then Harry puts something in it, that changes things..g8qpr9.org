What does he put in it and what does it change?


** Possibilitys:

The in-universe Harry Potter books box set: Voldemort now has to deal with managing his blood pressure, can only speak in rhyming couplets, and must now put hyphens between any written word he sees.

Butter: Nothing much, only a question regarding the habits of his nemisis, and having a temporary boost to magical energy.

Potato extract. It doesn't do that much vissually, it only makes it so tom has an extreme Irish accent.

His history notebook: Tom adapts mild goblin like features, develops Narcolepsy an becomes a wizard at amature noughts and crosses.

Thermite: He now has Incredible hyperactivity (Think a toddler with an IV drip of red bull.) And an incredible affinity of fire magic.

Termite: He is now very good at eating wood.

Dirt: . . . . . Voldy is now literally a mudblood.

I actually love this one. That's hilarious irony right there.

** I remember a story where they removed Tom Riddle sr.'s bones from his grave and replace it with potassium or something along those lines before the ritual, heh.

May or may not be a time travel fic, can't recall.

** Well I kind of liked this story where Harry spent more time understanding Arithmancy and can break down spells. So during the Ritual hecwas able to escape his captivity so instead of Blood of the enemy, he used something else.

The story is about 63K words and is called Dearest Hermione bt MariusDarkWolf.

  Angsty story based on Broomstick Flyers story 'Please Believe Me'. Heavy Hermione bashing to start, but will be H/Hr. Timetravel, AU, and limited soulbond. Please Read & Review Upping the rating due to language.
