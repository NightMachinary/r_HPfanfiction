I have yet to read a Fantastic Beasts fanfiction. Has anyone wrote or read any yet?


** Most of the stories are slash indeed, at least on AO3 but not poorly written. Sort by kudos or hits, *read the tags and ratings* before clicking on something and everything will be good and happy in the world. Personally I avoid anything shipping Credence. I know the actor is in his 20's and gorgeous as hell, but in the movie the character is young, vulnerable, abused and manipulated and I just can't.

** Most are badly written slash as far as I can tell. I haven't yet found one I'd recommend sorry.

** When the movie was released, I kind of read every single fic of this fandom (there wasn't much then. But it was fun to watch the fandom being built). So I can tell that not every single Fantastic Beasts fanfiction is slash. A lot are, but not all. It's been a while since I've read them but here are some good non-slash works:

[[http://archiveofourown.org/series/591037]]

The Across the North Atlantic series is a story directly told after the event of the movies. It transcripts the letter exchange and the development of Tina/Newt relationship.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/8728021/chapters/20007931]] Linkao3(8728021)

Tina/Newt. I don't remember much about it, to be honest but I remember reading it in one go, so it must have been good...

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/8648809/chapters/19833010]] Linkao3(8648809)

One chapter is the point of view of one character about Newt. It starts with Grindelwald, then Pickett, and so on. The chapters are basically one-shot and are inequal, some are really good, some are "meh" but it's a fun read.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/8712958/chapters/20370784]] Linkao3(8712958)

It's not finished but the author starts uploading again, so here we are. It's Newt's point of view about strange things he notices about this curious species named humans. It does rely a lot on the Socially-Awkward!Newt trope.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/8676250/chapters/19890658]] Linkao3(8676250)

The Cigarette's Case is an interesting take on what may happen to the real Mr Graves since Grindelwald have taken his place but we know from Mad-Eye example that you need the original alive and around when you're an impostor... (not slash. But people may interpret it that way)

If I spend more time on it, I could find you some more, but those are the ones I remember without searching much about it. But it's a start.

  Apparently even Gellert Grindelwald isn't immune to a niffler's sticky paws. (In which Newt was not expecting to find Percival Graves in a stolen cigarette case.)

#+begin_quote
  Newt Scamander and the people (creatures, beasts, I'm pretty sure I can put anything sentient here) that get drawn into his life. A series of ficlets from different character's point of view that may, at some point, be connected or have a plot but as yet do not. Also Pickett. Quite a bit of Pickett.

  Newt and Tina. Tina and Newt. Magical adventures. But, no matter how far they go or how much they see, they still have to answer to their Ministries. London is always waiting. With the drizzle. Tina doesn't appreciate the drizzle.Newtina. Jacoweenie. Slowburn and super fluffy.

#+begin_quote
  Newt Scamander has never really had a group of friends before. Now that he has, he's realizing that humans can be just as beautiful and complex as the magical creatures he cares for. Each with their own unique traits that can be both positive and negative. It's rather confusing to be honest.Here are a few of his observations, along with the stories behind them.
