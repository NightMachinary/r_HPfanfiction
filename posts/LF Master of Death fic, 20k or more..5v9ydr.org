I've read some really great MoD fic's in the past and I've sort of run dry. Here's some criteria I look for (they're not mandatory, but the more the fic covers, the better)

Insane MoD i.e. linkffn(On a Pale Horse)

Immortal MoD i.e. again linkffn(On a Pale Horse)

Time Travel i.e. linkffn(Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is)

Any help is appreciated. Thanks!


** Shameless self-promotion!

It's a Mass Effect/Harry Potter crossover (with 2k followers, and 111k words) that I'm in the process of writing. And it covers two of your three criteria.

linkffn(12132088)

  Harry is bored. During his work as an unspeakable, he discovers something about the Veil of Death: It drops anyone who travels through it somewhere safe. Where? Nobody knows! But Harry's wanderlust is tingling, so, in search of adventure, Harry steps through the Veil. He winds up in Mass Effect. The Reapers won't know what hit them. Rated T for occasional language. MOD!Harry.

*** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/11115934/1/][*/The Shadow of Angmar/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5291694/Steelbadger][/Steelbadger/]]

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  Eager for more power, Galbatorix tried to create the first dragon Shade. The spirit he'd summoned, the Master of Death, took pity on the poor dragon and merged their souls rather than simply taking control of the body. Now with a mind to match his rage, the new Shruikan plans to dish out justice while he searches for his new Name. [On indefinite hiatus: Please see Ch28 for details]

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

** Take a look in the HPxAvengers section, that's a really popular crossover for MoD!Harry. I think one of my favorites is linkffn(Lost, Confused, Searching, Genius) and its sequels.

Also, another insane MoD is linkffn(Nightmare man).
