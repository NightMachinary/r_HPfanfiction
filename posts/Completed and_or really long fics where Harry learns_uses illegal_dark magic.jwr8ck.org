Ik that probably covers a lot of fics, but I'm mainly looking for ones that get into the definition of dark magic and magical theory type of stuff. I'm mainly looking for completed fics, but if it's like 200k+ I'll read WIPs as well.

Dark magic definitely has to be a major thing in the fic, but besides that any tropes/ships/etc is fine.

** There's a fic called With Strength of Steel Wings that's really good and about illegal blood runic magic and magic theory, but it's unfinished and I think it might be abandoned. It's 700k as is though. (Idk how to make a link to it)

** It takes FOREVER to get to Harry discovering he retained all of Voldemort's power after killing him including his affinity for dark magic (like three whole stories into the saga), but holy Gods, I enjoyed [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2801806/1/A-Time-and-Place-to-Grow][this fic]].

** Blood Crest fits the bill. Harry is kidnapped then apprenticed to a necromancer. It has the best comprehensive overview of horcruxes in the fandom and the world-building is quite impressive. It's over 400,000 words long so there's plenty to catch up on, but the pacing is very, very slow considering Harry is still in his second year. linkao3(Blood Crest by Cauchy)
