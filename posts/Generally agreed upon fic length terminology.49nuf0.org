I found a guide [[http://mujaji.net/kia/?page_id=18][here]] indicating fic lengths and their respective terms; is this generally agreed-upon within the fandom or are these arbitrary guidelines selected by the blogger?

---Drabble -- 100 words exactly

---Ficlet -- less than 1,000 words

---Short Story -- less than 10,000 words

---Novella -- less than 40,000 words

---Novel -- over 40,000 words

---Epic -- over 100,000 words


** Maybe it's more lax because it's fanfic, but 100,000 for an epic is a serious underestimation. I mean, I don't think anyone could call Prisoner of Azkaban an epic-length work with a straight face, and it's about 107k words.

And a novel of 40k words would be incredibly slim. Like, barely-over-a-hundred-pages-in-many-printings slim.

*** I agree. I don't think I've seen a fic that I would call "epic" be anything under 200k, and many of them are near 300k. I've written a completely generic 4th year story that clocked in at 117k words, and there's no way anyone would ever call it epic-length. I'd probably move the "novel" tier up to 100k, and then have a "lite-novel" tier at 60 or 75K.

**** Still - I've read plenty of 100k fics that I wouldn't call epics by any means. Like, there's only one plot, not that many characters, etc. 100k is a lot shorter than it sounds.

Like when I think of fanfic epics I tend to picture works that are like 250k and still going. The kind of fic that clocks in at 1000 pages or more on my e-reader.

***** Fanfiction is very different from published fiction. There's a lot more dawdling, a lot more fan service, and generally more scenes that aren't essential to the story. Compare canon scenes to fanfiction scenes and you'll get what I mean - canon ones are a lot more "on point" (well, at least in the first 4, before Rowling fired her editor). A 100K words in original fiction is tantamount to, let's say, 300K words in fanfiction.

******* It's a figure of speech. I don't think she actually fired her editor, but the latter books suffer from a severe lack of editing, and I think the reason for that is that Rowling didn't want to discuss the plot with her publishers and editor (something writers usually do), because she felt that she was such a big-time author, and that the series' fans would buy the books no matter what was in them (which is the truth).

** I have to agree with the other few posters so far: those seem a little on the short side.

I'd bump short story to sub 25k, novella to sub90k, novel to 90k+. I don't think I've seen epic refer to length before, usually just style or content (in a literary sense anyways). Have the ficlet category cover the starting gap up to 10k. I treat the categories fairly loosely though, as I imagine most others do in fanfic.

*** NANORWRIMO defines "novel" as 50k+ so that's my minimum for bestowing the term. I agree that ficlet should cover up to 10k. Yeah, this was among the first time I had seen "epic" refer to length as well and I was wondering if that was normal!

**** NANORWRIMO is also original, not fanfic. Having done some googling, 50k is about 200 words, which seems to be borderline to me, even for original fiction. 90k words is ~360 pages, which seems more of a median length to me.

I also rarely see the term novella used outside of fanfiction. That could be due to geography or maybe it's just fading terminology. I usually just see everything referred to as a "novel" with some being prefaced with "short" or "long". For example, I'd call /Shogun/ (paperback clocks in at 1152 pages) a (very) long novel, and something like /The Physiognomy/ or /Descent Into Hell/ (244 and 222 pages, respectively) as very short novels.

***** This is true that NANO is original, not fanfic, but I liked the idea of having some kind of baseline to judge by.

I agree about novella; I've never really seen it applied until this post. It seems like an unnecessary distinction.

** Is 'vignette' not a thing anymore? Or am I just old and they're called 'ficlets' now?

This is the part where I say 'back in my day', isn't it? Oh, dear, I /am/ old.... Anyway, when I first entered a couple of fandoms (not HP until a few years later), a drabble was 100 words, and a vignette was anything under 800 words or so except 100 words exactly. It was occasionally defined as a series of connected drabbles. Was this never a thing in HP fandom?

Regardless of my confusion over that, I agree with the other posters - these guidelines are pretty low. I would put novel at 50k - 150k words at least.

** In fanfic, there is little editing and plenty of room for extra words that are not needed. So the 100k epic is only epic if the story arc is amazing too.

My stories tend to be 50k at a minimum and I feel like those are short stories... because my larger stories are 500k plus

I'd bump these numbers:

#+begin_quote
  Drabble - up to 1,000 words

  Ficlet - less than 10,000 words

  Short Story - less than 40k

  Novella - less than 75k

  Novel - at least 75k up to 200k or so depending on if it just rambles or actually has a plot

  Epic - at least 250k words and with an actual storyline, even if its PWP it can't just be a bunch of porn scenes thrown together, it has to have at least one main arc if not a bunch of mini arcs thrown in. i wouldn't call it an epic unless it actually holds up to the scrutiny that a published original work would... though with obvious allowances for amateur editing.

*** I disagree on the first three. I'm from that sect of fanfic writers that insists a drabble is /exactly/ 100 words. Ficlets I tend to define as less than a 1,000, but I'm open to interpretation and I wouldn't say anything longer than 5,000. Short Stories I would stop at 20k, because that's about how much you can write in a single text (i.e. no chapter breaks) before epub generators split it up. (Semi-related: if your chapters are so long that an epub generator breaks them up, then they're too bloody long.)

***** To me, a ficlet is like a slightly expanded drabble. There's no way you should need 10k words for that. A drabble can give you a glimpse into an idea, while a ficlet gives you a scene of that idea. Embellished plot bunny, sure. A poll is a great idea!

** I prefer to use epic /length/, not epic. But 100k words is nowhere near long enough for that. OoTP was like 250k words so I think it should be at least that.

I go by this guide, roughly:

Drabble: up to 500 words

Ficlet: 500-2000 words

Short story: 2000-20k words

Novella: 20-50k words

Novel: 50k+ (thinking nanowrimo for that base)

Epic length: 300k+ words (if as an individual story)
