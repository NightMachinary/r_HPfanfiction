Post War Harry has settled down and enjoying a happy life with Ginny, or a Suitable Other, then something happens that drags him back into the thick of it.

Would prefer complete, long is better, plenty of action. Well written. Thank you for you Suggestions.


** I could just imagine that. He is alone, with nothing but an owl to keep him company, then one day someone breaks into his house and kills the owl. Then Harry just goes on a murder spree, would be pretty cool.

**** Replace the breaking off the floor to get the guns with digging up the Elder Wand from Dumbledore's tomb, and I think we might have something.

John: Harry\\
Viggo: Draco\\
Iosef: Scorpius\\
Perkins: Ginny (Harry divorces her and gets with Luna so Ginny becomes a killer too)\\
Helen Wick: Luna\\
Winston: Dumbledore\\
Aurellio: Blaise\\
Marcus: Kingsley

  Ten years later. All was well ... until Harry's wife dies under suspicious circumstances. Harry will not rest until he has vengeance. Neville is tasked by the Ministry with uncovering the truth before the Chosen One does something he will regret ...

** I'm more partial to a "let's get the gang back together" story. Harry, Hermione, and Ron pulling out the old tricks from the war again.

*** I do like those, but I'm a really big fan of solo protags. Maybe he goes to Ron and Hermione for help, but Harry would never go to his friends first and say, hey guys can you help me do this. He's a go off alone kinda person and then his friends find out what he's doing/planning on doing and they go ffs Harry, you're not going alone.
