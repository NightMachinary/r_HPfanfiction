Maybe she's dead. Maybe she's just not friends with them. Maybe there's another member of the trio. Maybe they time traveled/universe hopped and she didn't come. Whatever. Just no Hermione as a current friend.

No Harry/Death Eater pairings, but het and slash are both fine.

  A collection of related one-shots spanning Hogwarts, where Hermione never has her Halloween epiphany and so the trio never forms, leaving Harry & Ron to bro their way through Hogwarts, forced to learn for themselves what they need to know.

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)

**** True, though they dont really trust her and can't find much in common with her anymore, so they dont really hang out. Also their relationship with Hermione is not the premise of the story.

This kind of attitude I absolutely cannot relate to. If I were thrust into the past I wouldn't be concerned about my personal entertainment. I'd totally want to befriend my best friends again (even if their childish behaviour gets on my nerves) and I'd want to help them. For example one of my best friends had a much worse home environment than I was aware of when we were younger: I would invite him over much more than I already did. There's also a guy who I sat next to in school and was a kind of friend that killed himself a couple of years after school. I'd certainly want to try to be a better friend for him.
