Gimme some forgiveness, friendly ness. Have Harry not hate the parents who made a mistake to an absurd degree, maybe he actually likes his siblings.

Or just like chill, why does he have to get into a pissing contest every time [Malfoy: exists].

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequenes of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** I understand the struggle. Harry is such an inherently good character, and I think people forget that. People also tend to forget that, when he's going through his whiny, yelly teen phase in OotP, it's actually super justified, and also HE'S ONLY 15.

I do think it can be hard to sympathise with a third person limited point of view character, because we're hearing and experiencing how ungenerous his thoughts and feelings are. But it's always good to try and remember the actions he eventually takes, because those show how wonderful and selfless of a human being he really is.

Also, real Harry obviously can't hold a grudge, he named his son after two men who horrifically abused him in his youth. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

** I'm actually writing a fic with a more chill and reflective 'Harry' but I am not sure if you would be interested in following trope: Harry dies during the BotM, Death sends him also (with his memories of course) and, via randomization, Harry ends up in the summer before first year as a different Harry Potter's twin sister, so he not only has to guide and help /this/ Harry Potter, he also has to learn being a girl and all the problems that come with it. I only started this recently (2 Chapters in, 1 waiting and 1 in the works) and try my best to not turn this fic into an angst fest or into a Harry who just /accepts/ being a girl; instead I try to keep the balance with the internal conflict he is going through. Don't know how successful I am or will be, but yeah, I try.

And it's kind of disheartening that so far a big part of my early readers are basically expecting me to turn that into a bashing fic lol.

I've read that sexual orientation is to /some extent/ dependent on brain structure (like gay men's brains showing some similarities to straight women's and lesbian women's brains showing similarities to straight men's). That's why, for my fic, I went with the "Harry's memories as Harry are stored in his soul instead of his brain" so I can give myself some freedom with handling and exploring the sexuality of Harry after being resurrected into that new existence as a girl.

I could just say "the soul hosting Harry's body before its death holds the memories of /that/ Harry" and be more or less done with it. The aspect of that conflict of "I only know how to be a boy but have to be a girl" is a fun and interesting trope, /if done well/.

***** On the other hand, consider a boy who wanted to get dangly earrings or grow out their hair or something else fairly innocuous but typically gendered. They may not have had the courage to do so when they occupied a male body, or perhaps they didn't even conceive of it as a possible thing for them to do. If this person woke up in a female body, I imagine it /would/ change their behavior, and they'd go ahead and get the earrings and grow out the hair or whatever else they weren't doing before.

I certainly agree that nobody is forcing girls to wear pink fairy dresses; however, people do force boys /not/ to, and so a "teenage boy forced into a female body" type sitch could certainly end up with the character acting more femme as a result. Not because they're forced to, but rather because they're free to.

Would that be the case in every circumstance? No, certainly not. I would guess that the typical guy, forced into a female body, would still end up being more masculine than most girls -- but probably they would also end up acting more feminine than they did beforehand (though to which extent would of course vary a lot depending on the individual.)

**** I think this is an interesting point that brings up a lot of questions. If the idea is that Harry's memories are dumped in a female brain, what does that do to the brain itself? If our ‚Äúpersonality‚Äù is a collection of memories, experiences and behaviors that are stored in and processed by the brain, wouldn't implanting memories fundamentally change that brain? And if so, would that change qualify as dysphoria? I think a memory dump would probably qualify as a ‚Äúphysical change‚Äù since there are physical and chemical properties inherent in how we process, store and recall memories - they don't exist separate from a physical brain (at least not that we know).

I guess there are several ways you could go with how this happened and what parts of the brain would be changed or stay the same (or what parts of the memories would be changed by having a new ‚Äúhost‚Äù brain). How Harry would process and make sense of this would, to me, definitely qualify as a dysphoric experience - but perhaps not a typical one since this is untraveled territory as far as the real world is concerned. That's part of the beauty of fiction and fanfic -it can reflect reality while not necessarily being grounded in it. ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø my two cents.

*** I'm just worried by reading your summary in this post that the Harry sent back by randomization will just be too OP and guide through any issues. Sounds like a fix-it with a small change. No offense.

None taken! I am actually doing my best to avoid any and all tropes of that genre. I don't mind reading a good fix-it with an overpowered Harry- they can be fun after all!- but I didn't start writing this fic with that in mind. The randomization aspect is not about what powers he will get but under what circumstances he will return. This Harry won't have special skills or powers. I try to focus more on the struggle he has to go through with the gender change, new relationships he will have to forge and him guiding the new Harry- his (or her) twin- to fulfil their destiny. The title "A Different Perspective" is not just for the giggles, it's what I try to make this fic all about: Harry returning to life but living it from a new, unfamiliar and different perspective while trying to come out on top through all of it.

Can't promise how successful I'll end up being with that though, lol.

  The Wizarding world hadn't seen the rise of the Three Lords in over a thousand years. Although time and again people tried to claim they were the Light Lord or the Dark Lord, the Grey Lord was absent altogether. How would Harry's life have changed if he were the Grey Lord? With a little bit of of Arthurian legend and a whole lot of book-slinging, the Three Lords' rise to power won't be easy, but together, they will interject the Wizarding world with the one thing it was sorely lacking: common sense. 11/26/18 - ON HIATUS while I work on original work for a while. :)

  What if Voldemort made a mistake with his Horcruxes? What if he had truly been vanquished that fatefull night? What if the Dursley's didnt treat Harry like crap, but rather with casual indifference? Who would Harry become and what would his world look like?

** I'm pretty sure that's just cannon lol, except for Malfoy and Snape. Harry is about the most forgiving character. He has his angst, but generally Dumbledore was correct when he talked about how miraculous a person Harry was. Harry forgives pretty much everyone without much fuss. Ron in GoF, The Hufflepuffs in CoS, Seamus + pretty much the whole school in OotP.

** I don't have a recommendation, but I'll answer the question:

Canon-Harry is too forgiving (Dumbledore basically fucked up his life and he forgives him, Snape fucked up Harry's life and he forgives him etc. etc.), so fanfiction writers make him less so, which is IMHO a good thing! This attitude of "you have to forgive everything others did to you" just sucks! No! If somebody fucked you over royally you don't need to forgive that person, especially if they think they are above the law (Dumbledore placing the helpless baby Harry on the doorstep of hateful muggles - I doubt the wizards don't have child-services! Dumbledore simply ignored the law!)

*** Sure, I can understand disliking and not agreeing with someone, but for gods sake, they both want to kill Voldemort, suck it up and deal.

What law did Dumbledore disregard? Where in canon are we told that there is anywhere for orphaned wizards babies to live?

And still, in some stories it's like ‚ÄúOh no, my friend is a teenager and made a mistake, I will never interact with him again because of this.‚Äù Sure, I can understand not forgiving someone who fucking murders your friends or /purposefully/, /and/ /knowingly/ leaves you to an abusive family, but in so many stories it turns into Harry never forgiving anyone, no matter how minor their grievances may be or how good of a reason they had.
