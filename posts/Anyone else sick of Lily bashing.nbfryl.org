Specifically for Lily cutting Snape off after he called her a slur. Like, I'm so sick of “Lily was a bitch. They were bffs for years, she should have forgiven him.”

Like... no?? If anything, she should have cut him off sooner.

Severus Snape is one of my favorite characters ever, but he was an asshole. Lily didn't owe him anything.

Like, imagine you're, let's say, a black person. Your childhood bestie is white guy who starts hanging out with the skinhead racist dudes. You hear that he's been calling the other POC racial slurs. For some reason, you decide to still be friends with him. Then he calls you the n-word in a fit of rage. Then he has the audacity to basically say “I'm sorry. I didn't mean it, you're one of the good blacks”. Later, you find out he joined the Ku Klux Klan.

Would you forgive him?

No. Let's be real here. You wouldn't. At that point the friendship has been on life support and you were pulling the plug.

So can we please, please stop criticizing Lily for cutting him off and not forgiving him? I see it so often in fanfiction. It's getting old.

*** Yeah even the apology Snape gave Lily was nothing more then empty words though, like Lily said he calls all people of her birth mudblood, the apology was worthy nothing. he wasn't sorry and Lily finally saw through that, Lily finally stopped being friends with the racist upcoming death eater. Lily's friends even wondered why she was friends with him. It makes me wonder sometimes about what some of the other muggleborn who got called mudblood and attacked by Snape thought about Lily hanging around with a racist I doubt they would think to highly of her.

***** - Mudblood not having an equivalent

Mudblood is a classist slur. Personally I'd say the best comparison is old vs new money among the wealthy. Old money looks down upon new money, but not as much as the non-wealthy. This comparison also takes into account the in-between group of half-bloods and how their treated differently by how close to new/old money they are. But I don't think that racism is a terrible comparison, discrimination is discrimination, I don't think it's the best though.

- Lily and Snape's friendship (and it's cease)

Admittedly, I may be stricter than most. But we don't actually /see/ the degradation of this friendship, and I'm unsure that the implications would meet what I personally consider bare minimum standards for what I expect from my friends. However, I do agree that at some point you do have to cut your losses, that's why my issues aren't with /what/ Lily does, but /how/ she does it and her actions /after/.

If I can use an example from another book, this reminds me of why I hate Tang Hao from King's Avatar. King's Avatar for context is a webnovel about esports, and the game is MMO-like with classes. Tang Hao demonstrates he is the best at his class, he is also a younger player as well. At one point he makes the point that new players are coming in to replace the older players. That doesn't mean the method of challenging the previous best player of his class, someone who is part of the reason he even has a job, in an all-star event and publicly disrespecting him is an okay thing to do. I consider Lily's actions in this situation similar. Was she justified in cutting ties? Sure. That doesn't mean that doing it in the way she did makes her any less of an asshole though.

The other issue is that she almost immediately started to shack up with James. Admittedly, there is no set timeline, but I've always considered this scene to have happened in 6th year. This means that within a year she's now dating James Potter, the man who bullied her previous best friend and someone she considered a friend a year prior. Even if James stopped bullying Snape in front of Lily, it's odd to be in a romantic relationship with someone who spent the previous 6 years attempting to break up your oldest friendship. Unless of course she never valued Snape as a friend, which doesn't put her in any better of a light. Not to mention that the quickness of this u-turn also could be taken to imply that she was looking for a reason to abandon Snape.

- Snape's friends

Here's my issue. The phrase “Pureblood Supremacists” can also be swapped out with “the only people not named Lily that treated Snape like he was a person”. This very scene also heavily implies that James had practically the entire school on his side. Outside of Lily and the pureblood supremacists, Snape had no one in his corner. Can you really fault Snape for joining up with the only people that treated him like he mattered? The most people that didn't treat him with open animosity? Yes these people used and manipulated him, but isn't it better than the open hatred his was exposed to everywhere else?

****** I disagree with the slur being more classist than racist. If you look at class in the HP books it seems to have little to do with blood purity. The Weasley family are pureblood but lack the influence of other pureblood families. Justin Finch-Flecherly has hallmarks of a high class status (double barrelled surname, name down for Eton) yet is considered a potent target for the Heir of Slytherin when the Heir's motives are assumed to be based on blood. When the kids rock up to Malfoy Manor Hermione is chosen to torture due to her blood status, not Ron despite his comparable poverty and lack of influence. (If Bellatrix was not blinded by blood hate and had actually chosen a victim based on likelihood to crack she would have picked Ron, or she would have interrogated Ron WHILE torturing Hermione.)

Blood purity is a type of racism, because it is concerned with "purity." Purity is based on race, not class. Aristocratic people marry into the middle classes all the time without outcry (e.g. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge) but marrying across race lines sadly and infuriatingly still provokes outrage from some sections of the community (e.g. The former Duke and Duchess of Sussex.) While I could see the Malfoy parents being concerned if Draco chose to marry a poor or lower class pureblood, I doubt that would get him kicked out, (or indeed blasted from the Black family tapestry) but marrying a muggleborn? That would be disowning territory.

Finally, in setting Muggle hating Voldemort up as a successor to Grindelwald and drawing clear parallels between Grindelwald and Hitler, JK Rowling is clearly using blood purity in the fictional world as an allegory for racial purity in the real one, which makes slurs based on blood status racial, not classist.

Voldemort and his Death Eaters do not believe Muggles are worthy of life, and they do not believe muggleborns are worthy of magic, and therefore believe there is no difference between the two, therefore they believe muggleborns, or "mudbloods" are not worthy of life. No one has ever killed someone solely based on their class, but plenty of people have been killed based solely on race.

******* Classism can be based on social class, not just economic class. I'd argue that blood purity is closer to a social class than a race.

Furthermore, Racism is different behaviour based on race or ethic group. For something to be considered an ethnic group they need to share a common background, culture, or descent. Since a mudblood can be Japanese, Egyptian, Argentinian, or Swedish with any real difference, I disagree they are an ethic group.

Intent matters little in my opinion, there are many things JK Rowling did terribly. She used abuse as flavour for many characters, did she attempt to show actual consequences of it, likely no, but she did so anyway with Snape. As I said previously discrimination is discrimination. This also applies to your comments on historical severity between classism and racism. This is a work of fiction, historical precedent is irrelevant as far as I'm considered. Also, Caste systems are a fine example of people being killed because of class.

******** Caste systems though are irrelevant in a British society, in which the books are based.

Authorial intent, while not absolute, is in this case important as the position of "Mudbloods" and those what call them that is one of the overall theses (thesises?) of the novels, the other being the power of love over evil.

Is economic class even a thing in Britain? (genuine question, I am not British) I thought social class was much more important, what with the many impoverished aristocrats currently living in Britain. I can see where what I wrote was unclear though re the Weasleys: I don't think their poverty means they lack social class, but their lack of influence (at the Ministry etc) curtails their ability to gain economic class by acquiring funds. To be more concise, though it is possible to be posh and then become poor, you can't be poor and become posh unless you stop being poor first (even then it will take a generation or two for the "noveau riche" stigma to fade- far out we live in a terrible society in a lot of ways...)

You are correct in that Muggle is not a race, but the way in which Muggles as a group are viewed by wizards in these books is an allegory for how people of one race are viewed by people not of that race in the real world, therefore the OP here has simply translated fantasy racism into real world racism, their premise holds. You may not like the original allegory or JK Rowling's conclusions drawn from it, but the OP's allegory is sound.

********* You know, except for when they exploited the Indian Caste system to their benefit, but whatever.

While I acknowledge artistic intent is a factor. I disagree on it's importance. Art is meant to be interpreted, and despite intent, blood status is in appearance closer to social class.

Economic class is the basic class system everyone is accustomed to. Personally, I live in Canada so I can't say for certain, but I have no reason to believe economic class doesn't exist in Britain.

Social class however can be affected by things like blood purity. For example, the social class for a 3rd cousin of the king is lower than that of the prince. That would be purity of blood line, no?

I never said that racism is a bad analogy. In fact, it's probably better than classism, simply based on accessibility. More people are more familiar with racism than the methods of classism. I simply stated I feel that classism is more accurate as a 1 for 1.

JK Rowling is an idiot who fails to do basic research, I have no doubt she probably believes that blood purity is racism. Also, a dialogue doesn't have to be a 1 for 1 to draw meaningful conclusions. Whatever you want to call it, the muggleborn issue is as impactful to wizarding society as racism is to western society. It's natural connections be drawn. But these same connections can be drawn to any type of discrimination that is a major issue in a society.

********** While the British exploited the Indian caste system, they did not import that system back to Britain and integrate it into their own society, which is why I stated it is irrelevant in a book based in Britain which follows British societal norms. I did not mean to imply that the Indian Caste System was unknown to Britain, or that the Britsh did not exploit it while in India, or to belittle the affects on Indian people when the British exploited it.

I don't think you are correct that economic class is "the basic" class structure for "everyone." Economic and Social class are interlinked, but the importance of them varies country to country and society to society.

I am struggling to find exactly what you are arguing here, is it that racism and classicm are interchangeable examples of prejudice when it comes to finding a real world analogy for blood purity prejudice? If so I can see that. I still disagree but I think my arguments come down to time and place (Britain, 90s) authorial intent (I think it more likely that a woman in JK Rowling's position in the 90s would tackle race that class) which you have already dismissed (fair, the importance of the author's intent is always going to be based on opinion and you are as entitled to yours as I am to mine) and on my own bias from reading the books in the 90s (the first three, anyway) and being much more aware of race as a contemporaneous topic of social concern than class. Hence here I am happy to agree to disagree.

​

(EDIT Having said that, I still feel blood purity is more likely to be a racial prejudice than a class prejudice because of it's consequences. At no time in British history was a person killed because they were lower class. The only class based deaths I can think of were the results of revolutions in which members of high class groups were targeted (French/Russian revolution, English civil war.) However, genocide, the killing of people based on race, has been a sadly constant atrocity throughout human history. The Death Eaters willingness to kill Muggles because they are muggles, and to hold the lives of Muggleborn people as less worthy because they are Muggleborn and for no other reason, is a strong argument for bloody purity being a racial prejudice, because the consequences align with racial prejudice, noit class prejudice.)

As an aside, while I have issues with JK Rowling (who doesn't?) I don't think she is an idiot. If she were I could forgive her own prejudices more easily. Her research and knowledge in some areas is phenomenal, but she has blind spots and biases and draws conclusions from incomplete knowledge, as do we all. I take issue when she is presented with new or different information or questioned on her bias and instead of examining her position she digs in.

*********** You pretty much got it. Muggleborn discrimination is an example of discrimination that people will tie to whatever the common discrimination is at the time. Personal context rules what it equates to. So while I'm of the opinion it's closer to Classism by definition, I do understand why people say racism and I'm not faulting them for it.

As for Rowling specifically, sure I was harsh. What I meant to say is that I don't consider her a good author by any stretch. There are many issues she glosses over without actually considering the effects. My biggest issue is mental health and effects of abuse. Harry shouldn't be able to function in society the way he does (also, he shouldn't be anywhere near average height, but I digress). Snape suffers from this too. While he is unadjusted, considering the context of his life, he is extremely well adjusted. Snape shouldn't be a functional human being and should probably be living with a keeper, yet he's just an asshole. Sure an asshole who become Neville's boggart, but just an asshole. As an author JK Rowling fails to recognize consequences. There is no reason Ron's betrayal in Goblet is any less of a transgression than Snape's snapping on Lily, yet it's completely forgiven with no explanation. Ron then proceeds to completely ignore Harry for a summer of PTSD and abuse, and again no repercussions. Ron betrays Harry's trust again in the Horcrux hunt, and yet again suffers no consequences. Ginny was possessed repeatedly over the course of a year, and suffers no mental damage. JK Rowling is amazing at surface world building, but that is where her authorial skills end. But I will admit, she is an amazing business woman, and certainly knows how to capitalize on what she has. She is the reason theme part clauses exist in contracts now.

Genuinely enjoying this conversation by the way and the opportunity of sharpening my rhetoric skills, but only if it isn't actually upsetting you. For me this is low stakes compared to other arguments I could have, so just want to check it is the same for you? If not I'll back off.

Just wanted to give you a heads up for the future, the negative form of adjusted isn't unadjusted, it is maladjusted. I knew what you meant, but some people will jump down your throat for those sort of slip ups (particularly if you write then in a fanfiction piece!) and it is annoying and derailing, so thought you would like to know for future writing.

************* Enjoy your weekend, mine starts tomorrow (EST).

I like the conversation. I have no major investment in it.

That's got to be a regional thing, I have literally never hear the term maladjusted in my life.

That said, fic wise despite me workshopping it, it's fairly unlikely to actually be posted. My loose papers of workshopped ideas (admitted folded to be pocket size) is probably about 30cm tall by now (1 foot for Imperial friends) and that doesn't include the notes I've written on my phone/ computers. One of my pet peeves as a reader is a large potential story that's unfinished, as such I've made a rule only to ever post a finished story. I've finished all of one of my stories, and I've yet to transfer it to a text file so it has yet to be posted lol.

That said, if I can gush about (one of) my current pet fics (the Mtg one). It's actually a mega crossover, MtG with its lore allows me to justify visiting many worlds with characters of a specific criteria. It also has its magic system be aligned with personality, as well. So it was fun to Workshop Snape into this world, where he's free from the reality of the Wizarding world. Admittedly, he changed more into the cunning, than ambitious type, as he now has the power to walk out of the reality of anything bothering him. James Potter trying to curse him? Now Snape is hanging out with Dragons on Tarkir. His father about to belt him? Well good luck trying while he's studying dinosaurs on Ixalan. I have Snape completely changing colour alignment. All this disregarding the extra fandoms I'm adding in too. Snape's first walk (a first walk happens at a traumatizing event, hence why I wanted to know timing for worst memory (admittedly, near death works too)) has him entering the Ichidian Universe (which is from a series that has all of 18 fics on AO3 and FFN combined), and he carved out a new house for himself on a mostly abandoned planet. I think the interactions between Magic and Sci-Fi tech could be cool. I'm also going to throw the most stereotypical Gryffindor like group of pirates at him too.

I need to hurry up and write down one of my other ones so I can move focus to this. Complete and vaguely related side note, I'm disappointed by the lack of Marauder Era fics that have Slytherin!Harry, also the ones that have teen parent Harry. Also, yes I have a weird obsession with Marauder era fics dispute my opinions on them. Honestly, it has more to do with the terrible backstories. The only character who benefited from backstories was Snape. Voldemort's backstory is something you literally cannot do with his archetype (as it breaks it), and Snape's backstory made me care about James/Lily's death even less than I already did (and I didn't care about it).

Alas, I've gone off topic and rambled enough. Thanks for entertaining me mate.

******* - Lily's actions

You make a good point. My opinion of Lily, well not completely fixed, would've been greatly benefitted by a scene where Lily attempted to integrate Snape into /her/ friend group. Do you honestly think that if Snape had an option to be around people that didn't entirely hate him and that Lily approved of (not to mention Lily at the same time), he wouldn't have taken it? Given Snape's devotion to her (which, yes is creepy), and her friends general opinion about him, I doubt that was attempted. Lily voiced concerns but never did anything about it. There is a massive difference between telling someone they have a problem and trying to help them. I think Lily could've and should've done more. Loyalty isn't about unwavering support, it's about making sure you're friends aren't fucking up terribly.

- The Scene

I figured you haven't, that's why I gave practically the entire scene lol. But let's run through the scene again shall we? It starts from the Marauders POV, they decide to pick on Snape /because they're bored/. Snape at the moment is minding his own business, reading a book. The Marauders then flip him and strip him waist down (or up I suppose), in front of the majority of the school. Lily, after laughing, tells off the Marauders and attempts to help Snape. Snape, understandably embarrassed after being sexually assaulted, lashes out. Lily then breaks off the friendship and practically denounces him in front of a large part of the school. The movies toned down this scene by quite a bit as I recall, but Lily doesn't come out of this looking good in my opinion.

- Timeline

If it was after OWLs I'll still say 6 years for brevities sake, but I don't recall seeing that when I was trying to find that timeline for that scene the other day. But yes, I'm referring to the mudblood scene. I'll trust you on this though.

- Relationship

Regardless, someone who bullied someone whom I claim to be a friend for 6yrs, nevermind who was meddling in my interpersonal relationships for that same amount of time, isn't worth the time of day. James was said to stop bullying Snape /in front of Lily/, he may have matured a little but I still don't look upon that in any good light. This relationship negatively impacts my opinion of Lily, and it's a major uphill climb to claim it shouldn't.

- Snape's revenge

There was in fact a character whom claimed that Snape “Gave as good as he got”. Unfortunately, that character was Sirius Black (who attempted to murder Snape might I add), who was defensive after Harry expressed extreme disappointment in his actions. Taking this statement at face value is equivalent to people finding out a company does shady business practices and trusting their damage control press release as 100% fact. I'm not buying it.

- Redemption

Okay, despite this conversation. This is the Hot Take, I promise.

I actually don't believe most people talked about in the redemption conversation, actually need it. First Draco is frequently in this conversation, but I take issue with saying he needs redemption for his beliefs when his primary influence (guardians) taught him for 11yrs before the series, he was better than everyone of a lower class. Not to mention that this belief was also likely shared among all secondary influences, and not challenged until his Hogwarts years, I disagree that he need be redeemed for that. I also don't think any of his actions are bad enough to justify a redemption either. Dudley is in a similar boat. Dudley was rewarded for beating in Harry and being a brat. I think his apology at the end of the series was more than enough to absolve him of his part, and I consider it more of a blight on Petunia and Vernon than Dudley.

Snape is again, mostly solved with context. Snape started in an abusive home, progressed into a school where he was targeted since before even arriving at Hogwarts (James and Sirius targeted Snape on the train), then after that was immediately thrust into a war. People don't tend to fair well coming from /one/ of these things, nevermind /all/ of them. People fault Snape for not being functional in society, but I ask when could've been learned to be a functioning member of society? Look up veteran mental health, Snape was a spy too, he likely experienced the worst of both sides. If you don't want to read papers, the music video to Wrong Side of Heaven by Five Finger Death Punch does decent at representing it, and gives some statistics on the topic.

Snape being ‘redeemed' would, in my opinion, be a disservice to anyone in these situations. It would imply that they should be actively try to make up for their situations, that they have no control over. It's victim blaming at best.

It important to note (though I'm probably down voted at this point). I'm not saying these characters are faultless, their actions are still theirs. Snape is still Neville's Boggart. Snape is still not a good person, and shouldn't be a teacher. But to blame Snape alone is BS.

- Bashing

Personally I feel like bashing is an overly broad term to the point of uselessness. However, if anything gets to the point I consider it bashing I agree it shouldn't be done.

But I don't to turn around and say Lily is blameless while Snape is completely in the wrong here, also doesn't make sense to me.

****** Addendum, FYI the scene in which Snape calls Lily a Mudblood must happen in their fifth year, because it happens just after they leave an OWL examination. Then when Harry recounts the scene to Sirius, Sirius tells him Lily started dating James in seventh year, "after his head had deflated a bit" or words to that effect. So that is at the VERY least a 13 month gap between the dissolution of her friendship with Snape and her acceptance of James, and for a 15-17 year old 13 months is a very long time.

Edit: it bugged me enough (plus am procrastinating on what I am meant to be doing) to go grab the book, because I haven't read it in ages. I am mostly right, except it was Lupin who told Harry his parents got together in their seventh year, and then Sirius added in the bit about head deflation. It is in Order of the Phoenix, the chapter is "Careers Advice" and in my copy (1st Edition, Australia) it is page 591.

******** I disagree with your premise. I don't think James interfered in Lily and Snape's friendship, and I don't think it is a given that James bullied Severus for six years.

Remember, canonically we have only the memories Snape chose to provide to view both his relationship with Lily and his relationship with James. While they add up to one conclusion, I think we are missing Lily's point of view, and the small glimpses of it we get are indicative of a deeply flawed friendship with cracks beginning to show much earlier.

As for James interfering in Lily's friendship with Snape, when does he do that? I can't think of a single example in cannon, though I may be forgetting something.

We see James on the Hogwarts Express as a brash 11 year old, a child of privlige who lacks the social awareness that not eveyone thinks like he and his family do and is therefore rude and blunt. Annoying, but not insurmountable or unforgivable and not bullying.

We then jump forward to Snape complaining that James likes Lily, and being far more interested in that than in ACTUALLY LISTENING TO WHAT LILY IS SAYING about how uncomfortable she, his best friend, feels around his other friends, and when she does address his concerns about James she doesn't say anything about him bullying Snape, just that he is arrogant. Again, arrogancy is annoying, but it is not bullying. Neither Snape nor Lily mention James actively interfering in theior friendship, he is the topic of a conversation between them, but he hasn't orchestrated that conversation in any way.

The incident outside the OWLS is definitely bullying, but that isn't six years' worth, or even five by that point, and it comes after Snape and his friends have been involved in targeting Muggleborn students, according to his own memory of his talk with Lily. This doesn't excuse the bullying, but it does frame the incident in a context Harry did not have the first time he saw it, but that Lily did. If Lily has been dealing with a growing dissonance between Snape's treatment of her and his attitude to muggleborns as a group, and his willingness to befriend people who outright hate her for her muggleborn status, couldn't being called "Mudblood" by him be the metaphorical slap in the face she needed to readjust her ideas on Snape? And if that has happened, what loyalty does she now owe this person who has proved that under pressure they will use a slur against her? Has James tried to break up any of her other friendships, or just this one? She can't even excuse Snape on the grounds of his upbringing- because James is a pureblood, and whatever else he is, he is not prejudiced against any muggleborn, whereas Snape is prejudiced against muggles and muggleborns with her as the only exception, and has now just shown that when angry, humiliated and stressed he WILL use her blood status against her.

Lily doesn't have the knowledge of what will happen, she doesn't know Snape will "come good" (though there I would argue he doesn't entirely, he stops attacking muggleborns, but he himself is a much worse bully than James ever was, he bullies pupils over whom he has authority, which is despicable.) She does know that Snape has failed her utterly, has disrespected her, has undercut any work she has done to rehabilitate his character with her friends and has prejudices incompatible with their friendship continuing.

James, on the other hand, apparently "deflates his head," over the next 13-23 months, which is not outside the realms of possibility given how quickly children and teenagers change. Lily's issues with James seem to fundamentally have boiled down to his arrogance. It makes sense that an open-minded person who believes in the ability of people to change (maybe even admires that ability after seeing her former best friend be unable to overcome his prejudice) would approve of this change and welcome it. Without the one character flaw to which she has ever objected (as far as we know from Snape's own memories) what is stopping her from befriending James? And having befriended him, it is not inevitable that she will date him, but it becomes a possibility. James changed, just as Severus did, but Severus changed too late for Lily to see it, and it took her death for it to happen. That, I think, reflects poorly on Snape.

********* - interference

This is admittedly my personal interpretation. However, this is given with the context of house rivalries and Lily/Snape being in different houses. Especially after James' infatuation with Lily, I personally see this as a driving force. The other reason would be no reason, and that arguably makes James look worse.

- Train scene

I agree that this scene isn't bullying. However, this scene is clearly (in my opinion at least) when Snape was chosen as a target. James and Sirius never seem to bully anyone else, and considering their popularity I find it unlikely they did. I disagree the bullying didn't start soon after though, this scene would have no real purpose in my opinion otherwise.

- The conversation

I've said this previously. Telling someone they have a problem is not equivalent to doing something about it. If Lily truly didn't want Snape to be around the people he was (which it's worth noting, are psychopaths with free access to where he sleeps), she should've attempted to bring him into her friend group. As I said elsewhere, this scene would've improved (but overall, probably not fix) my opinion of Lily. If that had been an option, would Snape not have taken it? With his devotional Lily I find it difficult to believe he wouldn't have.

As for the bullying: a) James explicitly hides it from Lily during (at least) 7th year, no reason to believe she's seeing it, b) she's a child and teenage boys aren't likely to admit to being bullied, c) publicly making a fool out of Snape is the attempt (and it worked mind you).

- The incident

We'll have to agree to disagree on length of time I imagine. You're never going to convince me that it started that year. With the levels of animosity from both sides and severity of actions, I cannot agree to that.

Also, I said in my initial comment. My issue isn't that Lily stopped being friends with Snape. It's how she did it, and of course the relationship negatively impacts my opinion as well. Just because you don't owe someone loyalty doesn't mean you should be an asshole.

I disagree that Snape proves himself worse than James with context.

Look, you're not going to convince me this relationship doesn't reflect poorly on Lily. I'm sorry. If Lily's issue is arrogance and not James being an active bully, fine your point stands. That still doesn't improve my opinion, nor does it change the fact that she overlooked that.

- My opinions on Snape

I feel like this gets lost with how often I defend Snape from victim blaming. But I agree Snape isn't a good person. Snape is beyond damaged goods, he shouldn't be working with children in any capacity. He went from abuse to bullied to a war with little/no downtime between them. Any one of these issues is enough to make someone dysfunctional in society, nevermind all of them. Snape isn't a good person, and yes he does need to be held accountable for his actions, he undeniably fucked up here. I'm not trying to absolve Snape of his actions, but to say Lily is blame free, or James should get off his actions, is something I disagree with.

***** “Since there is no prejudice against ones blood in real world, there so no special word for it, but I'm not sure why you would say it's closer to a lord-peasant thing that racist thing. Pure blood supremacists thought that Muggleborns were inherently inferior to Pure bloods. The talk about 'keeping the blood pure' can be analogous to 'keeping the genetics pure'. During the Voldemort's short reign muggleborns were forced themselves in to the government (or hide, in which case there were pursued) and after sham trials stripped of their wands, jobs, possibly sent to prison, some of them were implied to end up homeless and beggars on Diagon. It's not racism per se, because our definition of race doesn't include that, but it seems like a decent analogy.”

I said it was closer because of status and, well, nobility. As you say later, a lot of that is similar to what happened to peasants. It ties closer to that rather than race. As I said, I do not /hate/ the analogy, I just do not believe it fits and makes people think the situation is worse than what it is. Yes, it was still an awful thing that he did, but it is not as awful as calling her a racist term to her face. The issue is that it is all unique and ties into factors that have not existed. For example, royalty often marries other royalty. Is that racist? See, because after like four or five generations, I think Rowling said, you can go from a half-blood to a pure-blood. As long as your great-great-great grandparents are magical, you are fine. Then again, I do not think Rowling made that canon.

“Oh I definitely didn't mean in this way. I don't believe that Snape was abusive in their relationship or forced Lily to anything. But I don't believe it was a healthy friendship either. He was certainly poisoned and manipulated, but it sounds like Lily offered him what she could for how long she could. At some point she had to say stop for her own sanity.”

Never meant to imply that you did. I do not think it was healthy either way. For him and for her. Moving apart was for the best. Lily offered him far more than any normal human would. Makes it seem so much nicer of he seeing as she was a teenager and she was an ‘enemy' of the House he was in.

“That he did, but the point is it's not that one word that really ended this friendship, but his whole behaviour: making friends with and defending pureblood supremacists, aiming to be Death Eater - that Lily asks him about in their final conversation and he doesn't deny it. He seems to regret calling her a Mudblood, because it's her, not because the whole ideology is awful. He later asks to save Lily but not her family, even to Dumbledore.”

I am not here to defend Snape, to be honest. I think he is the best written character, next to Dumbledore. So flawed. So human. As such, he was so obsessed with her that he did not see her as a Mudblood, I dare say. I honestly think that without an intervention, if she remained friends with him, he would have became toxic. He would have become so overprotective, jealous, and afraid it would be suffocating.

I love discussing Snape as he is such a great character with so much depth. A delightful dark shade of grey. There is light there, yes, but also a lot of darkness.

****** I think that "mudblood" and "pureblood" are definitely analogous to racial slurs/language, simply because those are things that someone has no control over and they are directly linked to their parentage. The whole blood quotient method of determining if someone is muggleborn, halfblood, or pureblood was modeled /directly/ off the Nazi Nuremburg Laws to determine whether or not someone was legally Jewish or if their most recent Jewish ancestor was far enough back that they were "pure".

A better comparison might be to the KKK. Snape was like a mixed race kid that passed for white, whose non-white parent brutalized him and his mom. Then he gets put in a dorm for 7 years with basically kids of KKK families, and grew into their company trying to fit in and it consumed him. To the point that he insulted his best childhood friend with a slur and lost her friendship forever (rightfully so).

Agreed that aspect of their friendship wasn't healthy. Snape is one of my favorite characters, but Lily was absolutely within her rights to enforce that boundary when he crossed it with her.

He really seems like someone who would have become very codependent in a relationship without a lot of self awareness and support from a counselor. He was\\
a codependent friend for sure. Definitely Lily wasn't in the position to provide that for him and she shouldn't have been expected to when she wasn't comfortable with it any more. I don't understand why people bash her for it.

******** Possessing magic vs no magic at all is a physical trait.

In the minds of folks who care about pureblood wizards and crap, just being one generation out of "no magic" people isn't good enough to make you one of them. One of their greatest fears is producing non magical children, which is often blamed on muggles in the family tree. So, to them a halfblood or muggleborn is "tainted" and you wouldn't want to marry them because heaven forbid your kid might not have magic.

Filch was terrified of his squib status being discovered. Neville's family basically told him through their actions that they would rather have a dead child than a non magical one. Even the Weasleys have a squib relative they don't talk to, and those two families are supposed to be the GOOD guys. There is a lot of cultural fear of muggles and everything coming from them, even if it happens to be more magical folks.

EDIT: Also, lots and lots of Jews and Romani folks being very much white passing did not stop the Nazis from rounding them up and slaughtering them. It's not always appearance based.

  Up at the teacher's table, professor Quirrell was talking to a teacher with dirty red hair hanging around her sickly pale face like a curtain. Looking past Quirrell, two poison-green eyes, devoid of any warmth or empathy, found Harry's own brown ones, and he felt a sharp pain on his scar.“Who's that teacher talking to professor Quirrell?”“Oh, you know professor Quirrell already do you? No wonder he's looking so nervous, that's professor Evans, the potions mistress. Don't get on her bad side, the old hag hates students.“Harry looked again, but the teacher was no longer looking at him. Still, Harry could not escape the nagging feeling, which he had gotten just from a glimpse of her eyes and the cruel twist of her lips, that professor Evans did not like him very much.

******* What you said reminded me of what a friend once told me. when you date online you want to meet the person asap so you fall in love with who they are and dont fall in love with the ideal of them.

Snape loved the idea of lily, some where lily ceased to be an actual person in his mind and he fell in love with the idea of lily

I think Snape at the time cared more for the power he felt with dark magic then he did for lily.

it makes sense, he is powerless at home so he seeks that power.

People are weird, I remember on twitter, Felton said something they disagreed with and they where like we stan draco not felton and its like Draco was in the magic hitler youth there is this weird part of the human brain where if the person is attractive you let them get away with more shit

I agree he is a rich character and I think a lot of youth don't realize the seriousness of horrible groups and gangs when they are young until something happens and they do. Him being roped into a hater group by people that probably made him feel accepted isn't unrealistic. He regretted his actions after. I just wish we would've seen a little more depth in him towards Harry. His redemption fell a little short for me to forgive him. But maybe that's the point good guys aren't always nice and likeable.

***** The best... THE BEST(!!) argument I ever heard was that Snape only used the slur ONCE (not once against Lily, but once overall) in a spur of the moment because she didn't protect him against James and seems to be on his side.

Of course, Lily says that he uses it against every muggleborn apart from her all the time. BUT EVIL LILY WAS LYING!

That was legit the argument. Because we never see Snape use the word again during the flashback (not before or after) he clearly didn't use it. And if Lily says she did, she was a stupid manipulative bad friend who had the hots for James from the start and was simply lying. Or others were lying to her. Maybe James lied to her, and she believed it to impress him!

***** Yes, you just take a deep look in the mirror and admit to yourself that if it crossed your mind to call someone a slur when you're angry, then you think of that slur in your life. You believe it to some extent. I think some people also have trouble recognising this trait in themselves, so for them it makes sense that it "slipped". It's like the people who say racist stuff but don't like to get called out because how can they be racist? They even have black friends!

As for Snape, I thought it was crystal clear that his love was selfish. He didn't try to fix everything for her, he did it to ease his guilt. Even before that, all his actions showed that his love for Lily was always in the shadow of some sort of hatred. That "always" scene that makes everyone fall in love with him actually makes me deapise him even more. After all, Snape never grew to like Harry, he still projected his hatred for James on him, and it still was all about Lily and the guilt he felt.

******* I think many people sympathise with his sad background life. Many don't believe it justifies his actions, but understand where he comes from and believe he redeemed himself later in life, that Snape became a better person and made a huge sacrifice.

I personally don't see his huge sacrifice as a noble thing. Brave and well performed, yes, but what did he have to lose? His life was miserable. In that sense, Ron had a lot more to lose when he ran away with Harry to hunt horcruxes, for example. Having Harry around both disgusted Snape because of James and gave him a sense of purpose because he longed to ease his guilt. Snape didn't go out of his way to do all that. He helped it happen, he had nothing else to live for, which was his fault alone, and most if not all of his good deeds were under Dumbledore's command, not out of the goodness of his heart.

I don't see him switching sides for anything other than a selfish reason. Some people believe it was more than that, but I honestly only see a self-centered man. Even when he's sacrificing for others, there is a selfish reason behind it.

This most likely may only be a movie thing, but Hermione's Confounding Charm here seemed very controlled and short during the tryout. She basically 'told' him to go one side instead of the other so he wouldn't block all of the Quaffles and so Ron could keep being the Keeper (pun intended). This of course doesn't excuse it, but it does appear to be less dangerous than simply weakening the mental faculties of someone for a long time while in the air.

There are literally hundreds of thousands of stories with Hermione featured in them, and tens of thousands where she's the main character. She is not a Mary Sue in all of them. You're negatively generalizing a character you don't like because you don't like them.

In some of them, despite the character's flawlessness, I actually like it a lot. Sometimes she's basically perfect, but not quit Mary Sue too...

Overall, I think there's a lot of Hermione fics that ignore a lot of her flaws. While that's the case for most fics - most other characters have almost as many bad or realistic portrayals as they have (almost) perfect portrayals. Hermione is the one where I have the most hard time, to find a not perfect version. It makes writing her kind of difficult for me.

** I'm tired of James and the Marauders bashing. It's always ‘Bully' James and ‘Bully' Marauders who treat poor Snape like shit, and they're so horrible. Meanwhile Snape fans ignore what was happening during that time period.

According to the Harry Potter Fandom wiki, the first wizarding war officially started 1970, though it had foundations in the 1940s. Meaning James would have been 10yrs old at that time as he was born in 1960. While they might have been children, by the time they started Hogwarts in 1971, They would have seen, heard of and probably understood some of the growing anti-muggleborn and muggle hate that was happening at the time. Especially Sirius.

in the years before, and during hogwarts, they would have experienced loss as people and friends they knew did not return to school after holidays. They would see black letters arriving daily, attended funerals of family members and cousins and friends who died at the hands of the Death Eaters. And with Sirius being a Black and living with a family that supported everything that was happening during the war, they would have had a very good idea of who in the school might support Voldemort and cheer on each death.

And here's Snape, a dark, brooding and spiteful kid, jealous of James and Sirius. They see this dark halfbood making cozy and friendly with several of the children of Voldemort's supporters; and who was learning and creating dark magic, of course they would've hated Snape. And while James might have been interested in Lily, I have no doubt he also wanted to protect her from the people who wanted her dead.

A lot of the James and Sirius haters ignore everything that was happening during their school years. They were experiencing a war outside of the school and they could see the enemies that were in the school. They fought a war while in school, against the children of death eaters, and even Sirius says that their enemies gave as good as they got.

James may have started arrogant, but he became a better man by the end, while Snape was always a POS and only got worse, and even after Lily dies due to his actions, he remains a horrible, spiteful man.

Sorry for the soapbox, but I've been seeing too many James bashing ficus lately.

** I feel like none of the bashings are well deserved. I think they have more of a shock value:

- Lily... we don't know what she was like in life and despite the fact that many say only good things of her to Harry, also most people don't speak ill of the dead... but when push came to shove she was willing to die for those she loved and she still had a whole life ahead of her.

- James: sure he was a bit of a dick in high school because he grew up spoiled but he really cared about his friends enough that he pushed the limits of magic, brought one in his house after he ran away from home and never demanded anything from the weakest one despite allowing him to hang out with 'the popular kids'. He also saved the life of his nemesis and was overall a well-liked guy so he couldn't have been that bad.

- Ron: he turned his back on Harry twice out of jealousy but also people forget that he basically gave Harry a family, was his first real friend, followed him in multiple adventures (sometimes even sacrificing or being willing to sacrifice himself) and overall I think anyone needs a friend like Ron (unless you're a celebrity who's always going to cast a shadow over him);

- Molly: loving mother of seven who accepted an orphan boy as her own son in her own house despite her family's financial struggles. How did she have the audacity to worry for his well-being?

- Ginny: she's the one character I don't get why she's bashed. I mean she was nasty to Zacharias Smith, yes. But she was also the only nice person to Luna. She seems like a cool and kind person. Her only fault was that she had a schoolgirl crush on Harry and later Harry developed a crush on her when she was unavailable.

- Dumbledore: yeah he was powerful, yeah he was smart but he was not a Deus Ex Machina. He couldn't solve all the world's problems and even in the story many expect him to do. At the end of the day he was still a human with flaws, but nevertheless a human that tried to leave a better world behind him. And for all his machinations, he managed to get Harry alive out of a situation that seemed like the only way it would be resolved was by Harry dying.

*** I think some of the criticism of Molly is very on point, but it is also because she is not shown as a paragon of virtue ans is also a real person. For example,

1. She knows Reeta Skeeter is a poisonous bug, but believed her lies about Hermione in Book 4 and gave her an obligation gift that made sure everyone knew she didn't think well of her. Hermione is 14 at the time.

2. She constantly judged Fleur and whether she was sincere about her love for Bill, but what is the basis for this? Why does she think so? She changes her mind about Fleur when she Fleur insists on staying with Bill, so she clearly thought she was with Bill for his looks, and also seemed to think Fleur, a Triwizard Champion, was some sort of an airhead... I wonder whether this was because of her looks or because she was not fully human?

3. This is on both Arthur and Molly. When Ron started school, Percy had just become a prefect, and he was given a new set of robes and an owl as a present. Ron was sent with an old wand with the unicorn tail poking out of it. A wand is the most important magical equipment, so how come one son gets 2 gifts (and one can argue that the school has lots of owls and an owl is therefore not a necessary "equipment" to have, but a wand is). I'm not surprised Ron feels neglected or like a left over item.

4. Again on both parents. Ron also did not seem to have any cooking skills while in the tent and got resentful towards hermione, if memory serves, about her cooking. Very gendered view of life and his parents did not teach him better. At 17 one van say that his attitude indicated that he did not see anything different at home.

5. She keeps feuding with Sirius and is nasty about reminding him that he was incarcerated, knowing perfectly well that he was falsely punished and never had a hearing to prove his guilt or innocence, just tossed into jail. Just because she could be. In the books he is nothing but generous to her family and to her, and she always tries to undermine him.

6. She often mixes up the twins, and forgets about them when Ron is made prefect ("that's everyone in the family!"). While the latter may be excitement, it is still really odd. As for the former, I have known two sets of identical twins and their families have always been able to tell them apart even when I cannot. Heck, even Harry can tell the twins apart in the books, but their own mother cannot?

7. Ah, just remembered that time Ron said someone was a "scarlet woman", and he said he learnt that term from his mum.

Many things about Molly are wonderful, and personally I think that these make her a much more "real" character, but there is a reason people dislike her too, it is not just mindless "bashing". Molly believes in gender roles and traditional or orthodox ways of behaving and is a judgemental woman.

There are lots of things about Dumbledore which are worth criticising too, and in general the fandom has dissected that. Personally I have seen very few people point these things out about Molly, though. Perhaps since i do not like to read negative fiction, but even in general discourse, I have not really come across these.

Given how annoying brothers are, it is possible that they were refusing to play with her too 🙄

Oh yeah I forgot about the squib cousin, and yes Ron isn't sure but he did say that he thinks they are an accountant. I guess there could be an interpretation that maybe the cousin doesn't want to speak to them, but who knows.

Yeah Molly is quite sexist, and I think for me what really drove it home was how she behaved with Hermione in Book 4. Incredible.

****** I love Professor McGonagall, she's one of my favourite characters, but I can point out a mistake or two. What annoys me the most is how she (or any other professor for that matter) didn't help Neville, who is clearly has a learning impairment, not just a 'slow-learner' way.

We later find out why, but as his head of house, she should have given him some attention. Maybe she would have pinpointed the problem sooner and his education wouldn't be so compromised.

She also allowed Harry into the quidditch team and gave him his own broom, even though this is forbidden.

Not horrible things at all, but Professor McGonagall isn't perfect either. And I agree that compraing to other adults, she's amazing.

Also, despite Molly's mistakes, I still don't get the hate. It's one thing to be flawed (Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny are all flawed, for example), but she isn't a bad person. She's the mother we would die to have.

******* Oh yes, I agree with your points about Minerva, but I do think that it is likely that we don't always see her interactions with Neville. She told him about his grandmother failing charms, for example. I think the Quidditch thing is ultimately a very hogwarts or at least a very dumbledore thing, like how he thinks it is okay to tell kids that somwthing is forbidden in thr third floor corridor, or how the forbidden forest is okay for detentions (???), or how an underage magician who says he didn't put his name in the goblet can still be in the Triwizard tournament just because he wants to see what is happening. I don't think Minerva could have changed the underage rule. I think she asked Dumbledore and he allowed it.

I have actually never seen much Molly "hate", unless it is in fics i don't read, because why bring negativity into my life, but the reason a lot of people dislike her is that she is diefied by the fandom by being some sort of a perfect mother. She is really not. She is a prejudiced person, especially against girls and women, and she implements these prejudices into her and her kids life or Ron would not have judged someone to be a "scarlet woman". And many of us face these prejudices in our own life, so to see someone doing all this and then being held up as a paragon of virtue is damaging. She is also not a mother I would have died for 🤷🏻‍♀️ I have a lot of issues with my own mother, such as her sexism that is a somewhat like Molly's (perhaps why it was easy for me to recognise), but we were also not well off growing up and my parents made sure that my brother and I had all the necessary equipment we needed. Ron is obviously starved for attention, and then he is given a visibly defective wand. This is not something an ideal or even decent parent does, when they have the resources to buy a different kid an expensive gift. That is why this is not just a mistake.

Like Sirius said, the world is not divided into good people and death eaters. She is a good person in some ways and she is also a prejudiced person who chose to not learn better. Both happen in real life.

And being protective of a child is very different to judging the child's fiancée so much that you make clear that you think they are only with them for their child's looks. How insulting for the child too, like wtf.

2. Where is anyone blaming anyone for being poor? I have clearly demonstrated that Percy got TWO gifts for being made a prefect, and that ONE of those two gifts could easily have been not given to Percy and that money used to but an ESSENTIAL magical equipment for Ron. Where have I said anything about hand me downs other than getting a used wand which it is already Canon that people should use wands that are matched to them, and that a new wand could have been purchased for Ron instead of giving Percy TWO gifts?

******* Yeah she is not a bad person in that, aa sirius said, the world is not divided into good people and death eaters.

She is however not a paragon or motherhood or personhood etc.

Making sure that your kids have all their basic needs met is the first and most important parameter for any parent. It is not a mistake to buy an expensive and somewhat unnecessary reward for one child and letting another go to school with a hand me down wand which was clearly damaged since it had the unicorn core poking out of it.

Wands are clearly studied a lot in the magical world since everyone uses one and there are lots of wand woods and cores and shops around the world. It has been well established throughout the books that it makes a difference, when the wand and the magician are not bonded, and in fact it is well established that some wands are dangerous when used by poor not bonded to them, or become useless with time. They gave this to an untrained wizard with no idea of how it would go. I am not even slightly surprised that Ron felt neglected in that family.

Also, if this was a one off incident, sure it could be chalked up to a mistake. However, I have mentioned lots of things over the books that made me take notice of Arthur and Molly in a negative way.

They are normal people and they are portrayed as such. However, the fandom has turned them into angels to be worshipped as perfect parents and people. They are not. They are just normal, everyday people who have Implemented their views and prejudices on their lives and the lives of their kids. Yea, Molly is a prejudiced person. From what we can read in the books, much more so than Arthur.

It is odd to me also that they know they do not have the resources, but have 7 kids. And then people in the fandom say that oh, how can you hold their poverty against them. While anyone can do whatever they want with their body, having 7 kids is a choice they make. They chose to have each of those kids. Then they decide to not even give those kids basic equipment because they want to give another one of those kids an expensive gift.

****** 1. Parents are not always thoughtful of their children's wishes and often times think they know better.

2. The thing with the wand choosing the wizard is only stated by Ollivander and it's confirmed to be true by Harry's experience. However wandlore is an ambiguous science and most common people don't understand it. Many could have just interpreted Ollivander's statement as a marketing ploy since most wizards can use other people's wands to cast spells to a certain extent. I can get the new robes as essential because no one will take authority seriously if they try to enforce rules while dressed up in rags. The owl was the reward. And Ron also got a broom and new robes when he became prefect.

2. They prioritised an owl for Percy over a wand for Ron, when the wand Ron was given had the unicorn tail poking out of it. What Ron got ad a reward for e coming a prefect is a moot point when they did not provide him with an essential magical equipment at the beginning of his magical education. They prioritised a two new things for one son, and sent the other off without an undamaged wand. Since it has not been mentioned, it is possible that Ginny got a new wand too, which would have also been a clear distinction. Also, you don't know that they considered Ollivander's statement a marketing ploy. There is no indication of the wand choosing the wizard and wands working better for people they chose than otherwise ever being anything but true in any of the stories, we are even shown that Hermione does not like using Bellatrix's wand. Wands are the most studied magical equipment there is since everyone requires one and there are several shops and different types of wood and wand cores all over the world. These two CHOSE to give one son two gifts and the other son a damaged wand. They had absolutely no idea how the wand would behave with Ron. There is wandlore that says that some wands become temperamental with age or damage, or because some unmatched user is using it. So yes, they should be judged for this.

********* Wands are a necessity too. Come on, "minor spells"? It's his first year in Hogwarts. A bad wand can impair his education, which it did, and if you struggle to learn the basic, everything becomes more difficult by default. Also, Charlie gave Ron his wand when he got a new one. What does this say about the wand? Hand-me-down robes are one thing, hand-me-down wands are much worse because, as I said, it affects your learning. Even hand-me-down books are fine as long as it is able to read them.

Even if you argue that Percy won't be taken seriously as a Prefect with old robes, it still does not affect his education. There clearly needs to be a balance. If you can provide all your children with the basic and wants to reward the one who got a special achievement, fine. But you can't favour this child if the other lacks the basic.

Not only wizards with average income, but also rich wizards bought their wands at his shop, so I don't think people assumed what he said was a sales pitch.

This is so obvious and commonsense that that you arw saying is just laughable at best. Getting one kid an owl when there is no need for them to have it, and palming off a damaged wand on another kid is neglectful and clearly shows favouritism and bad parenting logic. It is not your kids fault that you cannot afford things. You chose to have those kids so you should make sure they have the basics. And they could have done, but chose not to. They chose to get one kid an owl right at that moment, when they could easily have waited and perhaps got hom the owl 1 or 2 months the later, if they wanted to do that. They showed they are bad parents when they did this. When we were little and didn't have much to go on, our parents always made sure we had our basics, even if we didn't get birthday gifts or didn't get them immediately, or it was just home made cake and nice home made food.

They are not ideal parents and Molly is certainly not an ideal person as some people, clearly like you, want to push. She is a normal person who makes choices and has some very bad things about her as a parent and person, such as being controlling and sexist, and sometimes mean.

Fleur can grow out of her issues at 20. Molly has taught and implemented her thought processes on her children and her children's friends, and actively hurt them by her choices. Yea, lots of parents do this.

Dumbledore however did orchestrate that Harry would only walk to his death willingly and it would be Voldemort that gave him the killing strike, thus leading to his survival.

Harry and his friends spent the whole year hiding in the woods trying to figure out how to do the adults' jobs without any clues and mostly luck and author fiats to get by. That was also part of Dumbledore's plan?

Like Dumbledore knew that the whole battle of Hogwart would happen at the exact moment Harry would choose to go to Hogwart to get Ravenclaw's diadem and kill Nagini and that Riddle would give Harry another occasion to sacrifice himself by giving him the choice between his life and the students, choice Harry had already made since the first book?

*** I do have a special hatred for the Marauders because I don't think anything justifies what they did. What if someone turned you upside down and showed your underwear to everyone? And was amused and pleased with himself for it? It just doesn't sit right with me.

As for Dumbledore, he chose to put himself in this Deus Ex Machina situation. Of course you cannot expect him to be perfect, but he chose to play God by sharing only what was convenient for his plans and indulging people's next steps according to his plans. Also, the reason why he let go of his prejudice is ambiguous. Unlike Snape, who we know a lot about, we don't have much information regarding Dumbledore's young years, so we cannot tell for sure if he genuinely realised his mistakes and regretted them or if he just felt guilty for his sister's death. I'm not saying he's bad for it, but I do have mixed feelings and would have to take a better look into his character to build an opinion.

Ginny and Ron get more hate because of the movies, I think. They were very, very poorly portrayed. And Ron haters who read the book focus a lot on his mistakes and not enough in Harry's and Hermione's mistakes. To be honest, all three of them annoy the shit out of me sometimes, but they are great people.

Molly is the only bashing I don't understand at all. She isn't perfect, of course, but she's the mother many people would die to have. Molly's love is crucial in the books, it's crucial for Harry's upbringing and it has saved him too.

**** Nothing justifies it? The first wizard war officially started 1970. And it's foundations began in the 1940s. From the time The marauders were born up to, during and after their time at Hogwarts, they experienced war. They would have seen, heard of and know about the disappearances and deaths of family members, and friends; People they knew from school not returning after holidays; Black letters delivered weekly if not daily; obituaries in the paper and Funerals to go to and that's just the war outside.

What about inside the school. During 5th year Umbridge gave Malfoy and co. permission to bully and attack muggleborns, halfbloods and race traitors. Imaging what the pureblood children of death eaters felt they could get away with at the height of the first war? I could easily see worse happening. Bully, attacks, taunting the deaths of family members. And Snape was friends with these people.

Sirius would have known who many of the children of Voldemort's supporter, just by being a Black. You might call it bullying but they probably felt like they were fighting a war to protect people they knew at school. And then you have Snape, a dark spiteful, and jealous kid who came to school knowing dark magic; he, as a halfblood was recruited by Malfoy sr, and made friends with other Death eater children. It was implied by Lily that he, at the very least insulted if not bullied and attacked the other muggleborn. And according to Sirius, he and his friends gave back to the Marauders as good as they got.

There was a war outside the school, and at the same time there was a war fought inside the school, and while James eventually grew out of his arrogance and became a better man, Snape arguably only got worse. Despite his actions causing Lily's death, he never became a better man, and that's why James will always be better than Snape.

No. I personally don't believe it's okay to expose anyone's underwear to the whole school and 'humour' the crowd by asking if they wanted to see him taking it off. I don't believe it's right to vilify Snape for being a supremacist, then pretend it's okay that James sexually harassed him because he was a supremacist. They were both awful.

Also, I don't believe James and Sirius did that out of principles. Lily said James hexed students just because they annoyed him. The reason why they went after Snape after the O.W.L.s was because Sirius was bored. Not once had any of the Marauders mentioned supremacy to justify what they did. The reason James gave was "it's more the fact that he exists, if you know what I mean," which doesn't say much. Every indication we have is that they did it for fun.

#+begin_quote

Umbridge literally was on their side. I'm not saying everything was perfect and safe back then, but the Headmaster was not indulging the supremacist students and oppressing the Muggle-borns. Yes, there was a war going on, just like in HBP. I'd argue Malfoy and co. got away with many more things in OotP regardless of that.

Barely. He stopped hexing everyone else but Snape. Granted, it's mentioned they did it to each other whenever they had the chance. Still, Lily thought James had stopped hexing everyone (one of the reasons why she accepted dating him eventually) and he didn't tell her about it.

James was brave and against prejudice since always, apparently. The fact that he became even braver and joined the Order doesn't mean he stopped being a dick. The only indication we have is that he grew less arrogant and stopped hexing most people, but still lied to the girl he liked about doing it to Snape. This is an improvement, for sure, but there is no indication he became a /good/ person. Just like the Malfoys love each other and are despicable to everyone else, James could still be a 'toerag' despite his bravery and love. People are multidimensional.

****** So I read that James told Lily that he would stop Hexing people. The quote I have from Harry Potter fandom-“He stopped hexing bystanders for fun, though he still secretly hexed Snape, and in turn, Snape never lost an opportunity to hex him back, although it's implied that James was willing to stop for Lily's sake.” This quote makes it seem like James was the first to start throwing spells at Snape. However If he was willing to stop for Lily, why would he continue to start shit with Snape? With what we know of Snape's character, It is far more likely that Snape was the one who would hex James first, especially as he hated him for saving his life and for getting closer to Lily, and then James would retaliate.

Snape was a spiteful pissant, he was known for following the Marauders around, trying to get them in trouble, and trying to find a way to get them expelled. The only reason Sirius told him to check it the shrieking shack in the first place was because he was again, trying find something on them, to get them in trouble and expelled. Hell, if I recall right, Snape even implied he knew what the Marauders were up to, implying that he may of known Remus was a werewolf before Sirius told him to check the shack out. Yah James, Sirius and Snape all started off on the wrong foot, but if some little prick continuously followed me around trying to get me in shit, you bet I'd hate him.

Also, who invented the Hex that James used to flip Snape up to show his underwear? If you didn't know, it was Snape, it was his spell. So I wonder how James found out about it? Who would Snape have used it on first. And he did escalate to trying to kill James after. Snape was also a bully too, half the reason Lily broke friendship with him after he called her a Mudblood was because she knew he was bullying and attacking other muggleborn with his friends in slytherin.

I know James was a spoiled child, turn arrogant jock but he grew up to be a good man, while there wasn't a lot shown there had to have been more than a few reasons why Lily started to date him.

And while J.K. Did a horrible job of building depth to the first wizard war, it's not hard to guess with accuracy, what life would have been like for the people experiencing that time period, just going off of what was said by those who lived it in the books

Snape sure was wrong for that and was either really dumb or had ill intentions when he followed them to the Shrieking Shack, probably the latter. But it doesn't justify Sirius telling him to go there, knowing he could become a werewolf or die, especially if he wasn't sure whether Snape knew about Remus or not. Because he also exposed his own friend by doing it.

I even said "granted, they hexed each other whenever they had the chance", so I'm aware of that. My point was that he didn't tell Lily. I don't get why Snape fighting back (and I don't blame him after years of bullying) justifies James hiding it from Lily.

#+begin_quote
  Also, who invented the Hex that James used to flip Snape up to show his underwear?
#+end_quote

The purpose is to turn people upside down, not expose them. James literally asked if the other students around them wanted to see him take his pants off. You can't even argue it was by mistake. So I don't blame Snape if he wanted to fight back the bullying after years of it and I wouldn't judge James and Sirius if they were getting back at Snape for bullying others, but sexual harassment is very different than bullying.

It seems like your dislike of James is based upon a couple snippets of Snape's memories of the guy; A man who absolutely hated James and blindly saw worst in James, so much so that he projected all his hate for James onto Harry. He wouldn't even accept that the reason for James saving his life could be more than protecting Remus and Sirius.

No, my judgement is not entirely based on Snape's opinion. I do recognise that he did stuff like saying James only saved his life pretty much to protect Sirius, even though we don't have proof of that, but we do have proof that he likely knew Remus was a werewolf, so he isn't so innocent. But it doesn't change the fact that Sirius was wrong too.

I do recognise that Snape mentioned James only attacked him when it was four (all the Marauders) against one, when we have proof that Peter just cheered and Remus turned a blind eye, so it was just two. But two against one still is wrong.

I do recognise that he projected his hatred on Harry, even though not only he isn't to blame, but he also is Lily's son (supposedly the love of his life). He also became a Death Eater, with has no excuse whatsoever. He only switched sides when he realised Lily was in imminent danger, even though the only reason she was is that she loved her son and wanted to protect him. Still, Snape didn't care if Harry died as long as she lived. He made many other mistakes and I never, not for one second, said Snape was a good guy.

All the memories that we see might belong to Snape, but they are narrated from Harry's perspective, who would always try to defend his parents and other father figures. That, along with things that Snape, Sirius and Remus had said and done about their past were what built my take on all of those memories.

Snape hated the Marauders, and James especifically, for a reason. It wasn't only because he got to marry Lily, this just made it worse. It was also because, long before that, there were years of bullying performed by James and Sirius, and supported by Remus and Peter. They were awful to him and James, along with Sirius, was the worst. Does it justify Snape's shit? No. Does Snape's shit justify James' shit? No.

Even the whole “hexing innocent students” IMO is taking out of context. The twins did similar stuff during their time at Hogwarts and yet they don't get called bullies in the official wiki and by the average potter fan. I believe James while mischievous, spoiled and somewhat arrogant was a good person at his core, as evident from how he treated muggleborn, Remus, as well as his friends and peers. As well as stated by several people who knew him as a child and adult. And I believe to understand why he act the way he did towards Snape and the other children of Voldemort's supporters, you have to also accept and understand what the wizarding world was experiencing at the time and how it could've shaped the people living through it.

To be honest, if I were a Slytherin student, I'd hate them with my might. But then again, most characters, if not all, are close and fond of them, and therefore biased.

James treated people well when he believed they were his equals. He didn't think any less of Muggle-borns or werewolves. You can tell who he is by the way he treats his 'inferiors'. His 'labelling' just is not based on blood.

Most people who talked good things about James were close and fond of him. When you have someone who knew James better and had a (very) low opinion of him, it helps you even out the perspectives. We get to see his best and worst, and each person builds their own opinion on it.

James even saved the mans life, despite hating Snape, yet I doubt Snape would've done the same. The one scene we see Snape and James together, James attacked Snape “just cause he was alive..”, I don't doubt that there were times Snape did the same.

Snape was at his most bias when interacting with James, so his interpretation of the man was flawed. James teachers who saw him every day said he was arrogant but good at heart and became a better man as he got older, his fellow OotP members who fought with him against Voldemort, said he was a good and brave man. Lily who knew him at his worse changed her mind about him after he matured; enough to marry him. By every metric James was a better person than Snape.

The whole thing with Sirius is ambiguous, because Molly is overprotective of Harry and Sirius sort of treats him like James (his young adult friend). And the love potion thing is even more ambiguous. Everyone acts as though every love potion is Amortentia. There is a recent post about this, but I don't remember if it's here or on the HP sub.

** On one hand, I agree with you in the sense that yes, Lily is not in the wrong for ditching Snape at that point. On the other, I'm curious what kind of fics you read that has invoked this reaction, because I've hardly ever seen this. Lily is one of the characters bashed the least in the fandom IME, to the point where people usually do the opposite and pull a Snape -- put her on a pedestal.

FWIW, I think both Severus and Lily could have been better friends to each other at various points -- Severus needs to get his shit together in terms of how he treat Muggleborns other than Lily, and Lily could stand to take Snape more seriously when he comments on the trouble the Marauders cause him (Werewolf prank aftermath in particular comes to mind). But I would never fault Lily for cutting Severus off after the O.W.L. incident. She has probably heard Mudblood a lot from Slytherins in her year, but at least Severus is an exception -- until he isn't. It must have felt like an utter betrayal.

** Currently reading a fic where Lily was a dark ritualist, with the reason Voldemord went crazy that she made a ritual backfire on him. Bellatrix Lestrange begged to reverse that but she laughed in her face.

That is to say, Lily Potter née Evans is pretty much a blank canvas for fanfic writers because she is mostly talked about and has only a few scenes where she actually is directly involved in the books (and even then... As a ghost/apparition?).

So wherever Lily forgives Snape, if he never joints the Death Eaters, or if she is they go and start an even darker counter revolution because he's a vampire and she's discusted by a society that hates him for it... That is something for the author to work out. As long as it's believable, it can and will be a very fun AU.

Because we don't get a well defined character for Lily, we don't know what would be OOC.

** Nathan Beard (Gandalf's Beard) has made a lot of good points on Quora about Snape. If someone's a Lily-basher on this issue, it's a guarantee they are also a major James-basher (and Sirius basher goes without saying). In addition to pointing out that "/Sectumsempra/ was Snape's favorite spell" in Hogwarts (!!!) and that Lily was already criticising him for going along with his Slytherin friends cursing First years (!!!), canon never, ever deals with what Snape said to those Death Eater and future Death Eater friends about LILY. Does anyone believe it was good things? Or that he ever defended her? I do not. If she was lucky he said she would be a good mistress. It probably goes downhill from there. Following up on that, what if James or Sirius eavesdropped on Snape talking about Lily? Or saw him do nothing when his Death Eater friends were cursing first years? Or even join in? Because he helped get James killed, Snape has the advantage when it comes to brainwashing Harry with selective memories. We don't see James do anything that could be called bullying to anyone but Snape in canon. And if there were other Slytherins involved, if they were, say, first years, why wouldn't Lily have mentioned that? She did, explicitly, talking about her "friend" Snape. What we do see him do, years before Lily agreed to date him, is bust his ass to help save Remus Lupin. We see him take in Sirius Black despite his family's evil reputation. And so on. We don't see Snape - ever - do even one nice thing in Hogwarts. Clever things, absolutely. And even his pre-Hogwarts friendship with Lily seems to have exacerbated the rift between Petunia and her. In emphasising how Harry finds out his father is only human, the emphasis is ONLY on Snape's feelings, Snape's perspective. We're told James fell in love with Lily basically in First Year. That the enmity between him and Snape grew year after year. Well, it must have been frustrating seeing Snape fitting in to the Death Eater den that Slughorn let Slytherin house become. If Lily was too naiive to believe James, Sirius and Remus, that probably made their blood boil - especially with Snape espousing the philosophy that reduced Lily to an animal, the same philosophy Sirius' family espoused when they tortured him. The same philosophy he was losing his little brother to.

Also, to quote the late Phil Ochs: "Some of our best Negroes are friends."

** I love Snape and some ways relate to him, but still i don't see how Lily had any choice but to cut him off. He was running with future death eaters and pureblood supremists, was showing some early signs of his own capacity for cruelty (even if it was a reaction to another's cruelty), and what's worse used a prejudicial slur against her when all she was trying to do was be supportive. This was a low moment for Snape and not the first disagreement they had if you follow her canon comments and I don't really see how you can blame a person for being "done". There is an actual limit to forgiveness, isn't there?

** You're absolutely right, people need to stop with this horseshit. Snape's sad backstory scene shouldn't be an excuse to elevate him to hero status because he was friends with Harry's mum and then ruined that by becoming a wizard nazi. That scene showed that James was a bullying cunt when he was young and Snape was a racist cunt when he was young, it was /not/ showing that Lily was a cunt for being furious with both of them.

We know both boys were supposed to have gotten better with age but I'm not impressed with either of them. James needed to be forced to stop bullying by Lily and he only did it because he fancied her, suggesting that if he didn't fancy her he might not have improved as a person at all. Snape needed to have his crush murdered before he noticed that Voldemort was unspeakably cruel??? He should have known better without Lily needing to die and James should have known better without Lily needing to represent a reward for good behaviour.

We don't know much about Lily at all- much due to author's absolute obsession with making male characters more fleshed out than female ones- but from what we have seen, she extended friendship to both boys when they were good people and not when they were bad. She was friends with Snape when he was a harmless kid and she was friends with James after he stopped causing harm. That is not a bad trait. In fact, I do this and so does everyone else. If someone is a dickhead you don't stay or become friends with them, you should exercise your right to surround yourself with good people. James without bullying leaves you with a guy fighting for equality, snape without his dark mark was a goth kid she spent her childhood with. Both her choices to move on from snape and with james were fine and not character flaws.

I can dislike her husband and ex-friend without blaming her for their flaws, and I think everyone else should be able to do this too.

Some of you think blaming women for men's actions is fine and have never been disgusted by a loved one's discrimination and it shows. James' and Snape's bad behaviour were their own faults. Let your opinion of Lily be based on her characterisation and choices, not these idiot men.

** Yes! Thank you.

Also, not that this is like a "guaranteed thing", but we know Snape came from a really abusive household.

We all know that he's not made any real effort to get therapy or heal himself until AFTER Lily was dead, and even then, he never worked on himself, he never healed, and he never moved on.

So my point is, how long would it have been for Snape to have abused Lily as a romantic partner? His whole death eatery thing doesn't look good as a friend, let alone, "soul mate."

I have plans to write a darker-what if about Severus and Lily, with the focus being how insidious domestic abuse starts. It's not all slaps.

*** Have you read linkffn(Puzzle)? Probably the most realistic portrayal of post-Halloween Snily (it's a dark fic) IMO. One thing in particular that the fic does right is that it is a good example of not all abuse being physical. Snape never physically harms Lily, which I can totally believe -- he saw his father do that, and he doesn't want to become his father. But the relationship remains emotionally toxic, since for a person like Snape, with his upbringing, emotional abuse is more subtle and "harder" to recognize in oneself.

It does a real disservice to the complexity of his character --- love him or hate him, he's always been one of the most interesting characters --- to dismiss his popularity to being based on the movies.

Also, it's canon that a patronus can't be generated by “corrupted” emotions, which is why no genuine Death Eater can produce one. It's sad that people can't imagine staying loyal to the memory of possibly the only friend he ever had, so they have to twist it into him just wanting to fuck her... but it's not canon.

What selfish desires would those be? Was he anticipating her rising from the dead to blow him? And what “obsession”?

I think you're one of only a few people I've talked to in all my years in the fandom that have such a view of Snape -- it's actually a bit refreshing, really, even if I disagree with you.

He may have loved Lily in his own way, but it was not normal, healthy love -- it was fueled by hell-bent obsession.

Just because he felt "love" for her doesn't mean that love wasn't fueled by selfless, and by extension due to how fucked up of a person he is, desires. That'd be enough to form a patronus, IMHO.

He also didn't care that her husband and child were targeted. He only wanted /her/ spared. James I can sort-of understand from his perspective, but Harry, her child, was an innocent. He also only decided to look out for Harry because he was part of Lily, and because Dumbledore basically guilted him into it.

He also only decided to turn a "new leaf" after he found out Voldemort was targeting her.

Snape was a horrible person, period. He may have been shaped that way in his childhood and adolescence, but he was truly a repugnant and messed up person.

What does this even mean? No, really... what form of love is completely selfless? I can't think of one, not even the love between a mother and child. So “fucked up” people can't love truly? This is what I don't like about fandom these days, no nuance or understanding of how actual human beings behave.

Perfect example is the demonizing of him for not asking about James and Harry. First off, he doesn't owe James ANYTHING, not for Lily's sake or anything else. Secondly, Harry was literally a potential subject of the prophecy, so how was Severus supposed to ask Voldemort to, uh, basically ignore the prophecy without getting AK'd instantly? Where would that have put everyone, with no one to spy on the DE's in either war?

As for him initially turning to Dumbledore and watching out for Harry for Lily's sake, so what? Do you think Sirius would have been as devoted to Harry if he weren't James' son as well as his godson? Everyone's got their own reasons why they do what they do, and you could argue about all of them being “selfish” if you cared to. Human nature. Also, it's pretty clear by the end of the series that Lily isn't his only motivation. If she were, there's no way would go through with Dumbledore's plan to let Harry die. He wouldn't have been affected by watching people die without being able to save them, nor would he have cared about Phineas Nigellus calling Hermione, someone he doesn't even like, a mudblood. He goes to his death thinking he's sending his best friend's son to his own death, something he's spent literally half his life trying to prevent, because it's for a greater cause. But he was ugly and unpleasant while doing it, so fuck him, I guess.

*** Fair analogy, but I still can't see any sort of logical reason for Lily bashing in this scenario. Just because Snape himself was a halfblood and came from an abusive household doesn't excuse his actions, especially considering that halfbloods are not discriminated against to nearly the same degree as muggleborns. She gave him every chance and stuck by him for years, and most would have cut him off sooner. What exactly do Lily bashers want from her?

**** The beauty of fanfiction is that you can cherry pick certainly parts of canon, emphasize others, and completely disregard the rest.

I'm guessing bashers look at it something like this:

Snape's mother 'white' comes from a powerful, rich family. His 'black' father is poor and abusive. He grows up in a predominantly black neighborhood where he is othered and bullied by the other kids.

In Hogwarts he gets sorted in the white supremacist house. He's likely bullied for his 'black' father by the students in his house. He is also bullied by the rich, white kids outside of his house. Ie. James and Sirius.

Somewhere along the way he starts hiding his 'black heritage and starts internalizing the racism. Sometimes conforming is the only safe thing to do.

He calls his first friend a racial slur. She abandons him and then very quickly marries the rich, white kid that bullied him for years.

... So if you reinterpret and look at the book in that way then I can see where the bashing comes from.

Is there more nuance to it? Yes. But there's also more nuance then Snape being obsessed with Lily. OP is simplifing and ignoring certain parts too.

Personally, I find the Lily/Severus/Maurauders dynamic fascinating.

Lily was completely right and justified in cutting out a toxic person from her life. Especially one who had fallen in with violent extremists. On the other hand, the fact that she then fell for James Potter - the rich, 'white' kid who spent most of his years bullying her biracial friend and constantly harassing her. Well...

***** I don't think you marry someone because of who they have been, but for who they are now. Past mistakes are not relevant as long as the spouse has moved on and will probably not repeat those mistakes. By the time James and Lily were 17/18 (when they started dating) James had calmed down and grown up. This was also the time Lily became friendly with him and got to know him. The arrogant and privileged kid that he was probably made him a bully to Snape (I don't remember any Canon instances right now that show him bullying anyone else like he did Snape) and it was wrong. Bulling is always wrong. But he changed. He grew up and decided to fight for the order, against blood prejudice. By they time they got married, James was (by all accounts, at least to my understanding) a good guy. He made mistakes, but humans always do, and he moved on and matured.

Snape, on the other hand didn't grow up. By the time he was in his thirties, he was a bully that used his position of authority to go unpanished. He called Harry names and insulted him, an 11-year-old kid who was just starting school (*fame isn't everything" implies he is coasting on his fame and "did not open a book" implies he is lazy) and attacked Hermione for being an insufferable know-it-all and says he "sees no difference" when her frontal teeth grow, implying she has very large frontal teeth. As a girl, specially a teenage girl (even a nerdy one, which I was) it hurts. That is not a man who changed, grew up or moved pass his bitterness. His choices are very different than James, even when he has a lot more time. Yes, he probably had an awful childhood, but that cannot excuse him forever. He dedicated his life to save Harry because he feels guilty of leading Voldemort towards Lily, but he didn't change himself. That is on adult Snape. I'm not saying he was evil or all bad, because humans are nuanced. But what he showed the world, was very deeply flawed.

My point is, friendships and people evolve. I think Lily stuck it out for as long as she could, but what happened after OWLs was her breaking point. That was her choice and what was right for her. Snape had a difficult beggining and was in between a rock and a hard place most of his life, but he also chose his bitter persona. Some excuse it because he had to keep his position as a spy, but he could have said the only way for Dumbledore to allow him to stay at hogwarts was to clean up his act. He simply didn't want to. He might have been a great head of house to his slytherins though, but we do not know that.

As for James, we all have regrets about our childhood and adolescence, we simply have to move on and no repeat them. I certainly wouldn't want to be single forever because no possible spouse would want me because I was a brat as a child. If I'm not a brat anymore, don't I deserve love anyways?

******* When I was 17 my best friend started dating my ex, whom I had broken up with for being an idiot. She saw how much of an idiot he was to me, but he was also very different with her. They actually got married and he is an awesome husband to her, it was something about the two of us together that didn't work. Sometimes, how a relationship works (friends or romantic) does not imply much about each character. I sure as hell hated the dude after we broke up, he called me fat (I was an athlete and certainly not fat) , unattractive, stupid and several other things that would define him as a toxic a-hole. But now he is different, specially to my friend, and both her an I saw that. They have the best marriage out of all my friends and I would certainly never could get in between them because of who he was to me. He changed, he deserves happiness too.

But I certainly agree with you disagreeing if you find it weird.. I think is part of how forgiving we are and how much we are willing to deal with stuff. If lily marrying James is icky to you, that is OK. We all have different histories and personalities and it's OK.

****** I agree that people shouldn't answer forever for their childhood and teen years mistakes. A lot of teenagers act like idots because they are learning about the world around growing out about what the parents taught while still making mistakes. James particularly was extremely spoiled but he somewhat grew out of it when he lost his parents and in the war.

James-Lily gets so bashing though, because he bullied her ex best friend and probably other people. James is not just a random jock that was randomly mean but Lily saw him acting this way. I noticed that he fact that they were so popular and wanted is also not relatable to a lot of people despite having nothing inherently wrong with it.

Also there's the info that Lily was attracted to James even in Snape worst memories and didn't really hate him, added to the fact that she dated him while still in Hogwarts - so it's not like there was a reencounter or great timeskip, plus Sirius said that James and Snape still hexed each other behind Lily's back, pointing that James wasn't completely honest with her or that Lily closed her eyes for his bully and show off tendencies. By conjecture it's a very complicated scenario that rubs a lot of people in the wrong way.

Also the fact that they were surrounded by worst people - Dusdleys and young Snape- makes them coming out as the better people.

**** I think people that dislike Lily are rubbed in the wrong way that she married the bully of her ex best friend. Which I particularly find weird but it seems everyone from the marauders era were complicated people. So, considering the fact that she married James among all people, then there's a lot of different interpretations: Some people treat her as a saint that can do no wrong and saved James (which is not much different than what Snape fans wanted Lily's role to be for Snape instead) while other people may treat her as a star chaser or an opportunistic woman. I'm not a great fan of Lily and James together themselves, but people tend to see those characters in black and white lenses: Harry parents they can do no wrong and can't get any criticism; or they were extremely obnoxious people with few rendeeming qualities.

Now, about Snape. Regardless of James flaws, Potter was undoubtedly the best option for romance, and Lily was completely right with moving on from a toxic relationship and not entertering in an abusive relationship with Snape, since by being with Snape she would put her mental and physical health at risk, not to mention that she would say "stfu" to all other half-blood people.

It reads much more like gang warfare - with the moment at the lake being one where Snape was caught without backup.

On Pottermore, JKR refers to Snape as as James' nemesis or arch-rival on multiple occasions (see the entry on the Marauder's map for multiple usages).

Basically, we are given a handful of Snape's memories (the incident by the lake is literally described as his worst memory, and both Lily's reaction and his subsequent backlash at Lily implies that that wasn't a regular occurrence the way is often made out, but a far worse incident), and a few short statements from those on the other side (although Lupin is sympathetic to Snape on multiple occasions, so his quotes are likely reliable). Not a huge amount to go on either way on the exact nature of their relationship.

But Dumbledore himself compares it to Harry and Malfoy, and whilst he wouldn't have witnessed every incident he is probably the most reliable statement.

So yeah, it reads to me very much as a rivalry, and that Snape had his gang too, and they all tried to get each other. We only ever see things from Snape's perspective, but there are plenty of hints that it was much more equal than four picking on one all the time (and even in the worst memory, it's predominately James with help from Sirius, with Remus looking uncomfortable and Peter looking on laughing - not four casting at one).

They read like they were all a bunch of pathetic teenage boys behaving like dicks, but James grew out of it (there's a scene I can't find but I'm sure was real where Harry finds James' old detention slips, and none date after 5th year), whereas Snape and his gang became death eaters.

Snape didn't take part in whatever the gang did to other students. We never see Lily accusing Snape of attacking, harassing anyone else. When Lily asks James why he hates Snape so much, he could have just said that he was a bigot, supremacist or anything like that, but instead he says he hates him because he exists.

All the other statements are made by Lupin, who is a spineless coward, who just stands there doing nothing, even after his friends are assaulting a classmate. He is obviously biased.

The only objective view of their feud we see is that James and Sirius gang up on Snape, because they are bored. Also James bullied others too, hexing people in the hallways. Between James and Snape, only James has been known to hex and bully other students, so I consider James and Snape to have a bully- victim relationship.

His conversation with Lily certainly suggests he was there:

#+begin_quote
  ”We are, Sev, but I don't like some of the people you're hanging round with! I'm sorry, but I detest Avery and Mulciber! Mulciber! What do you see in him, Sev, he's creepy! D'you know what he tried to do to Mary Macdonald the other day?"

  Lily had reached a pillar and leaned against it, looking up into the thin, sallow face.

  ”That was nothing," said Snape. "It was a laugh, that's all--"

  ”It was Dark Magic, and if you think that's funny--"
#+end_quote

This heavily implies to me he was at least as involved in that incident as you claim Lupin to be - and at least Lupin seemed uncomfortable where Snape is outright defending it.

The way I see it, if you cherry picked incidents from Harry's perspective of his and Malfoy's relationship, like when he stamps on Harry's face, calls him names, or flashes the Potter Stinks badges at him, you could make him look as much of a bully to Harry as James to Snape.

The reason we see theirs as a rivalry is because we see a lot more than just a few of their ‘worst memories'. We see that each ‘gave as good as they got', and they were very much equals despite Malfoy being a spoiled pureblood and Harry a neglected half blood. To me, Dumbledore's comparison is very fitting alongside the only comments we get from the other side implies a very different sort of relationship.

******* Sure, but that doesn't change the bully-victim relationship between the marauders (at least James and Sirius) and Snape. Remus himself says that he asked his friends to lay off of Snape

Besides there is a difference between Lupin and Snape. Lupin, during the lake incident, was a prefect. He could have given them detentions, taken out points.

He was in a position of power(compared to other students) and refused to do anything about it

Lupin in this case is in a very difficult position. If his secret got out, he'd be expelled. It is in his best interest to appease the other Marauders and letting them get away with stuff, because if he were to stand up against them, they might retaliate in a bad way.

If the marauders had retaliated in some other way, Remus should face it, have a re-think about his friendship with them, especially after the werewolf prank Sirius played, iirc in the same year. Just as Snape should have done when Lily questions him if he would drop his fascination with the Dark Arts and Death eaters

He dismissed Snape's bullying as "schoolboy grudge" and Snape's Worst Memory as "James got a bit carried away" and he was an adult when he said this. He also refers to their moonlight sneaking out as "best of times" when they risked many lives doing so. Remus was no helpless bystander, he often took part in their mischief. He was also a Prefect.

I mean, the Marauders refuse to call him by his given name for heaven's sake (emotional harrassment). If that isn't bullying then I don't know what is.

********* That's why I said she played "hard to get". She liked "bully James" besides his flaws and at some point gave up and succumbed to the popular guy flirting with her. There's the other possibility that James reformed to try to go out with her. Though its implied he was simply hiding his bully tendencies from Lily since Sirius said that he didn't fight with Snape in front of her but did behind her back.

Also I think the conjucture of the war with James being on the side of half-bloods like Lily; both being head of their houses, put them closer. In a life and death situation like the wizard war, some minor flaws can be overlooked.

That's why Lily (and James) get so much criticism. Considering the canon information provided by the author, the relationship is questionable and need a lot of mental stretch to make it make sense in a way that they are likeable together.

At least James was better than Snape as he fought in the "right side" and didn't call her slurs.

** The only thing that made me sympathise with Snape in this scene was knowing that Lily had to stop herself from smiling when James and Sirius were pulling him upside down (also, that's sexual harassment, he was literally in his pants), which probably made him angry at her, especifically.

Let's say that it didn't "slip", because that's prejudiced no questions asked. Instead, he went for the word that would hurt her the most on purpose. Now, that's a matter o principles. I personally don't think you can use that on someone, even though they think it's funny that you're being sexually harassed. I honestly have said all sorts of mean things in similar situations in my life, but I never threw words like the N word, faggot, whale or anything like this. I think that when you attack someone for who they are, you are just as rotten of a person as the ones who harassed you, but that's my take on it.

However, even if you think it justifies as a revenge, you still have to admit she had the right to cut ties. Lily had been the bigger person and kept him around when he was becoming a supremacist. She could have gotten revenge for that, but chose to have faith in their friendship. She made a huge mistake by thinking that was amusing, and for that I do think she's a bitch, but you have two options: 1) you are the bigger person and talk about it / forgive, or 2) you get revenge.

At the heat of the moment, he chose revenge, using something he knew would hurt her a lot. I have to stop my train of thoughts here to point out that they were at war - Muggle-borns were probably being murdered left and right and some of the other students in allegedly one of the safest places in the world literally wanted her dead. Snape calling her a mudblood back then has way more impact than Draco calling Hermione a mudblood in CoS. This is something fans often miss and I think it's because most of us have never experienced war or persecution.

Back to my thinking, if you chose revenge, don't expect things will be fine - you chose to make them worse. Am I here saying I would never do the same? Well, I wouldn't use this type of slur, but I'm vengeful as fuck, so I don't judge the idea of wanting revenge. However, Snape really went there when he already was halfway through and his other friends had been there for a while. Of course she had every right to end their friendship. Lily did something horrible, but he wasn't any better.

** I've rarely seen Lily properly bashed like that. I have seen pro-Snape stories that characterize her as overreacting to the "mudblood" incident because they missed the whole context around it, or else try to balance it out by pointing out how she was (apparently) holding herself back from laughing at Snape. Neither of which are really fair to Lily.

I would allow a bit of wiggle room, though, to say she should have given him an ultimatum: "Ditch your racist friends, or I'm through with you." Especially since she doesn't seem to have done so up to that point. Snape of course would not do it (by that point, it wouldn't surprise me if it would be hazardous to his health), and things proceed the same from there.

Even so, there's a reason why I don't buy any Lily/Snape relationship (even a Platonic one) unless it diverges before that point.

And while I'm sure it wasn't a pleasant experience for her, I think them drifting apart was a mutual effort. Also teenagers do stupid things.

** Your analogy is not complement accurate. Snape wasn't Lily's “white” childhood friend. If you remember, his father was a muggle who was a horrible person that most likely abused his mother and Snape himself. If we use your analogy, then Snape was a biracial kid who had several issues due to abusive father, powerless mother, and, perhaps, internalized racism who absolutely despised his own family. So, while his behavior is still inexcusable, it is at least understandable (compared to Draco, who was rich and powerful and still chose to be a racist ass).

Regarding Lily, I only have one issue with her. She smiled, when she saw Snape was being bullied. It doesn't matter whether you like the person or not, but you should never laugh at someone who is suffering from abuse.

Nevertheless, she was in her own right when she decided to end her friendship with Snape. She didn't owe anyone anything.
