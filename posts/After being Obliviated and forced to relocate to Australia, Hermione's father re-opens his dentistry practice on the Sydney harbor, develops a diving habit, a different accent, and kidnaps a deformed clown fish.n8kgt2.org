The whole "George Weasley is Willy Wonka" theory has admittedly led me down some strange trains of thought. The timeline for this one even kind of works.

*** I would like to see that developed. I can see him divorcing Hermione's mother and marrying an Aussie lady. I also have a strong suspicion that his misplaced obsession with his destructive niece could be because he unknowingly feels the loss of his daughter.

*** She sent them to Australia precisely because her mother had a sister or brother living there. That ties it all in cleanly.

**** Except that Hermione gave her parents while new identities. I dont know about you, but if my sister and her husband arrived from England calling themselves completely different names and not remembering my niece, I might think things are a bit suss.

***** Honestly, less of an issue than you may think. Australia is a very large distance away, and i doubt a ton of people know the specifics of distant, estranged family. And it's not like the Death Eaters would be able to properly parse modern muggle methods of finding or contacting people, much less the still-developing Internet.

All she has to do is make sure there's no real evidence of where they went, other than "visiting family", and that noone really recalls the couple of times they may have hinted at relatives in Australia.

Even then, there's a limit to how far the Death Eaters may be able to go. With all of Wizarding Britain in the hands of Moldyface and focused on stomping out the massive degree of dissent, as well as trouble from other, far more close countries on the continent...and not being able to reasonably use airlines... as well as not getting any good indication of WHERE other than "out of the country"...

It could take literal YEARS, if not DECADES, for the Death Eaters to find them.

She just needs to implant suggestions of changing their practice's name, and make sure noone knows where they're heading. Maybe leave a few fake hints across the pond towards the U.S.

No need for an identity change. No need to even erase their specific memories of her. Just have them forget about the war, and how she's "studying abroad", and wouldn't be joining them until she's finished. Just keep mum about the magic, like they have since she was eleven, and they just...blend in.

****** No need to explain how far away Australia is to me, I am Australian. And I was more referring to how Hermione specifically said she gave them different names, of course anyone could change that to what you mentioned by having specific things like the war removed.

******* Well she could lied about that. Maybe even oblivated herself. Just in case they get captured (as they were). And when she finally goes to Australia to fetch them, happy ever after because no hurt feelings trough forced oblivation.

*** Nemo takes place years after Deathly Hallows. The Grangers liked Australia and their new lives and decided to stay there. Darla is actually either Lily (there's no common term for your aunt's father, so they go with 'uncle') or Rose (they claim Hermione is their niece because they told everyone they don't have kids, so Rose is their grandniece, but they just call her a niece in public too for simplicity).

And they call her Darla instead of Rose/Lily because...I don't know, they all use fake names too or something.

**** I feel like the years between late 1997 and 2003 are sufficient for someone to become a proficient diver and build a new life, for sure.

This is an interesting take, but I also like Darla just being a totally uninvolved niece who is now - for a reason not immediately clear to the surrounding Aussie family members - the object of her previously distant uncle's affections.

There are actually a lot of ways this can go.

** I thought more people would focus on the magical, talking animal aspect of the Pixar classic, but Darla seems to make for an interesting plot point, too. I think if I was going to one-shot this I would write a lot about what happened on the reef from the dentist's perspective. It would be interesting if he interacted with Darla and started to get Hermione flashbacks or something weird seeping through from his former life, too.

** How would Darla happen? She's the niece. Although... I have had adults in my life I called aunt and uncle, for non relatives, it tends to be a term of endearment if you really like an adult/if you're close to an adult that's not a real relative, not because they were related to me, but because they were close to my mom. That could be something that happens here.
