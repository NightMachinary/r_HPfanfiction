I read few Arthur/Hermione and they were well written and I felt I would want more of them inspite of the age difference...The stories made good sense where Ron is a jerk to Hermione (breaks up with her in few of them) and Arthur as the miserable henpecked husband and they find love


** "Made sense"

"Ron dumps Hermione so she gets with his dad"

*** I never thought I would, but I actually quite enjoyed this Arthur/Hermione fic - linkffn(5497778)

I've been following the author for a while and despite my initial misgivings, I gave it a try and found it not too bad. Not perfect - it's a little bit spoofy and OOC, and it has some plot points that I know other readers are 100% against, but it's an interesting read.

Outside of Hermione, she is the female student Harry interacts with most consistently in all six years at Hogwarts, she seems to always be on his side/stick up for him when everyone's against him, and she never treats him like a celebrity.

  Harry Potter accidentally disappeared to another place and time the night his godfather fell through the veil. Voldemort has taken over and Harry is needed now more than ever to fight the growing evil. The only trouble is that Harry Potter is no longer a teenage wizard, but a full grown territorial marshal who uses weapons of a simpler, harsher time period, somewhere- west of here.

She was teaching when he was going to school, but we know that Dumbledore was probably teaching while she was going to school. So she's not really geriatric. I mean....of course the actors who played the characters in the movies are WAY older than the book characters (Minerva has dark black hair in the books), so I can see why you'd think that....

** I feel like there are not enough darker Harry pairings such as Harry/Bellatrix. I mean, there are some, but not as many as I would like to see. Another would be Harry/Fem!Voldemort. There are a chunk of Fem!Harry/Vold stories but less of the reverse.

Some other Harry oriented ones would be Harry/KatieBell, Harry/Fleur/Daphne, and on the more twisted side... Harry/Greengrass women or Harry/Delacour women (moms/daughters).

Some others outside of Harry would be Hermione/Tonks, Luna/Tonks (god i would love to see this match), Hermione/Krum (a quidditch story), Luna/Bellatrix, and Harems but with Luna in charge (just because it would be funny as hell). I love me some Luna.

"I don't know," Hermione admitted. "You?" His knuckles were white on his wand. "A sister," he said, his voice very low, "I'm hoping for a sister." Winner 2015 Energize WIP Awards. COMPLETE.
