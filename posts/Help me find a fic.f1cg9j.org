:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Okay so I know that this is not a lot to go on, but I am looking for an old HP fix-it/time travel fanfic. All I really remember is that Harry doesn't want Cedric to die again do he gets Cedric to say "Run like Hell" every time Harry says "Graveyards." Also I think that Cedric does survive, but tells Harry to pay for his therapy later in life. Please let me know if this sounds familiar.

*** It's been a while since I read this but I remember it being pretty great. Very crack-y, and Cedric literally has a panic attack when he ends up in the graveyard due to Harry's conditioning
