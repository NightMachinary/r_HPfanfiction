darklooshkin submitted this idea for a (AU?) fanfic that doesn't seem to have been written by anyone, but I was wondering if any body knew of a fic with a plot somewhats similar? Her is the post:

"Basically, Tom made his horcruxes and vamoosed to greener pastures after Dumbledore turned him down for the DADA post. His greatest ambition at the time, after all, was to teach DADA and there were other schools where he didn't have as much of a history with the headmaster out there. Sure, it was probably not ideal, but given that he was functionally immortal, he could afford to build up his career and knowledge/contacts base before having to go back.

But Riddle was a bit of a mad scientist. He'd successfully made a horcrux that was capable of interacting with its environment to an insane degree, but since his book most of the other horcruxes were made as emergency measures should Dumbledore somehow suss out that he'd made them.

So he went back to the drawing board. The horcruxes didn't render him insane, as he was still capable and powerful enough to essentially sit across his old rival and not try and kill him then & there. That, and given that a soul is a universe unto itself (see TheMadMadReviewer's take on the subject if you want an idea of what I'm talking about), he decided to test a theory-namely, that a horcrux could acts as more than just an anchor to its maker. That, given the right circumstances, it could evolve and grow on its own. In short, that a horcrux could actually evolve more as a person and, theoretically, become someone completely new.

So Tom build a body for the horcrux, made the brains and used a random idiot that happened to be handy to split his soul again.

He did this a couple of times to get the technique down and wound up with a modified horcrux ritual which, far from acting as a simple anchor tied to him, had tied the split soul to the body instead.

Since he didn't really need that whole Dark Lord thing anymore, given that he had time to conquer whatever he wanted now that he was immortal, Tom shunted a bunch of useless junk into the body's brain that would motivate it to not just sit around and mooch off its maker.

Said useless junk happened to be all his old plans and reasons for conquering Wizarding Britain. Oh, and the fake Occlumency projections Tom had worked on that really didn't do anything for him anymore, the one that he had made to convince legilimencers that he was a Dark Lord and could trace his lineage back to Slytherin himself.

Note that Tom dropped that particular obsession when it became clear to him that cackling evilly and killing people was part of a Dark Lord's job description, but tellingly wasn't part of a Dark Emperor Of All He Surveys' job description. Plus, the various books he'd read on the subject told him that doing so when trying to get taken seriously was a Bad Idea.

Also, he really needed to work on a better alias than Voldemort.

So he successfully makes a new him thanks to the horcrux ritual and, as a kind of 'now go forth and stop monologueing at me' present, gifts Tom jr jr with his old horcruxes since his newer versions were all better in his opinion and helped out during DADA classes.

Tom jr jr disappears shortly thereafter.

A couple of decades later, Riddle is thoroughly embarrassed when he opens the Daily Prophet and realises that the Dark Lord that has hilariously failed at conquering as dumb a country as Wizarding Britain is, in fact, Tom jr jr or, as he likes to call himself for some reason, Voldemort.

He resolves to forget to mention this when he's appoiinted Headmaster of Hogwarts. He's already put his name down for it, so the post should be his in about a century or so."

*** Sorry! I guess the line spacing must have gotten lost with copying-pasting.
