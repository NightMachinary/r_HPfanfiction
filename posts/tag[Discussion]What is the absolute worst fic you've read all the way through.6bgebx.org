** I can't remember the name of it and I don't really want to go searching because fuck this fic, but there was this Snape-time-travels-to-time-of-Marauders fic(ofc, Snape/Lily) which I actually found not too bad, except for a recurring annoyance with how utterly shittily James was portrayed. In the middle, it looked like the author was going to redeem James with an Imperius storyline, and I rejoiced...

And then James raped Lily.

And I read until the end to see if it was another Imperius or whatnot, but nope. It was not.

Just thinking about it makes me incredibly angry, to be honest. So much potential, all slaughtered to make James needlessly terrible.

*** I've read that one. I didn't like it much even before that horrid scene but I went nope and abandoned it after that part. It was awful.

I remember reading this godawful fic that bashed Dumbledore to the edges of the universe. Like not just the usual "I left you at the Dursleys to control you bs" but literally every bad thing that happened in the hp verse was because of him. I think he charmed the sorting hat so Harry would go to Gryffindor, doused the marauders with some potion to increase aggression or some shit, made Sirius pull the Werewolf incident, charmed them to be loyal him or something, doused Snape with a love potion for Lily, doused Lily with a love potion for James. doused Harry with a love potion for Ginny, and a bunch of other crap. It was such a train wreck that I couldn't stop reading it. I questioned my life goals after finally finishing it.

***** It's a nice idea but I can't really see it happening unless he gets sorted in Gryffindor.

linkffn(The Apprentice by Deborah Peters) is the best Snape time travel I've read. The Marauders are portrayed realistically and not as complete psychopaths. The Snape/Lily relationship feels natural. He becomes sort of friends with Remus, and there's lots of nice world building. It's probably abandoned though.

** I have a pretty low tolerance for bullshit, so I click out of stories pretty frequently. I wouldn't be surprised at this point if my completion rate was less than one story a month.

But I have some empathy. I've been there, most of us have been there. I'm a writer too, and I've written a lot of terrible shit over the years. But, I like to think my tastes have gotten better, and I've realized what it takes to make a good story. I try and do my part and help people avoid the years of misery that reading countless bad indy!Harry fics will bring, but some people just don't care, and that's fine, it's their choice. But is it really necessary to still be referring to Daphne Greengrass as the Ice Queen for no actual reason at all, after all this time?

Truthfully, I probably can't even remember the worst fic I've finished reading. It probably is a Harry/Daphne story, but so many of them are pretty much identical to each other that the actual name of the story isn't worth noting. I mean, I could be edgy and name something like TLIL or MoR. So, instead, I'll name Poison Pen, which is a story that if you've been reading fanfiction for more than a day will realize is just full to the brim with nonsensical illogical bullshit, hidden under a thin pretentious veneer of sophistication.

It's a really dumb fic, with all the indie!Harry cliches and actually making me hate my favourite pairing. I've read it as far as I did because the writing is ok... I think. There are way worse fics for sure, but they are unreadable and will be dropped after a paragraph or max one chapter.

** It wasn't the worst fic I read all the way through, but maybe the one I regret the most: linkffn(Mastermind Hunting by Louis IX)!!

If anyone has read that, you know what I'm talking about! Possibly, the worst ending I've experienced!

  This is a story of the life of Harry Potter. From his disappearance with his friendly relatives to Dumbledore chasing after him around the world, while Voldemort and muggle secret services loom in the background. Technology, Prophecies... one word: power.
