I read a fic a long time ago before I made an account and I would like to find it again. It is on fanfiction.net (although it could be on other sites too). The story is kind of like Deprived by TheCrimsonLord, where Harry is a bounty hunter/mercenary or something similar, and he was contracted to protect Fleur. They end up travelling to sone countries together and have adventures there (swamps and temples were involved if I remember correctly) Any answers are greatly appreciated. Also drop any great Harry/Fleur fics down there, thanks.


** Sorry that's it's not what you're looking for but since you asked, my favorite Harry/Fleur is linkffn(The British Reformation by kb0)

Not much in the way of magic. Mostly a Harry finding a way to relax during the war fic.

#+begin_quote
  After Sirius dies, Harry is isolated and feels betrayed by everyone who's been around him recently and leaves to figure out what he should do. An "old friend" is sent to look after him and try to bring him back. Together they search for a way to kill a Dark Lord and maybe fix society too.

** It's been a while since I read it, but I think "The French Connection" might be similar.

I don't think it's available on FFN or AO3 anymore though, so you might need to Google around a bit.
