I remember reading a fic once and I want to read it again because one image from it is stuck in my head. The only thing I can remember is that it's a Sirius and Remus (slash) fic, where Sirius comes to stay with Remus in Remus' house after Voldemort came back in GoF (I think he came to tell Remus about that, but I'm not sure. The timing might be different). Before he goes in he sits outside Remus' house in dog-form for a while and looks at it, it's a house that Remus lives in for free after the landlady died (I think) and Sirius is surprised to find out that Remus had such a difficult time with jobs etc. If I remember correctly, the reason Sirius thought Remus had betrayed the Potters was that Remus had disappeared before their death, but that was because Remus was homeless and didn't want his friends to know. I know it's not much to go on, but maybe someone else has read it... Much thanks to whoever can find it.


** So this isn't what you're looking for since it's not slash, but a lot of the elements of the beginning of All Will Be in Order are similar to your description.

It's pretty good, give it a shot if you haven't read it already.

*** Ah, this is the story I confused a lot of the details with I think... I don't trust my memory anymore. ;) But thanks!

** I think remember this fic. It's been a while since I've read it, and I only read the first few chapters, but I remember it. I don't know if I can dredge it up though.
