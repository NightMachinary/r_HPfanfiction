The basic idea is that the Dursley's were so afraid of drawing any attention to their magical nephew and thus risk the neighborhood thinking them as abnormal that they just limited Harry's interactions with the outside world as much as possible, adding in their propensity to not answer his questions and the result is that he understands the muggle world even less than the average pureblood.

His only real measuring stick of how muggles work (or anyone for that matter) is how his relatives behave inside their house when there is no one looking, so he is basically a blank state as far as social interactions and social norms as a whole go and decides to emulate the people with whom he has contact -which includes Hagrid, the goblins of Gringotts, Draco Malfoy, the dozens of people who crowded him in Diagon Alley, Augusta Longbotton- plus trying to blend in by behaving as people expect of him -Snape calling him arrogant, people expecting him to like the attention, Hagrid not seeing any problem in carelessly disregard muggles in front of him (not calling him bigoted, just showing how it could be seen)... no one is quite sure to how they should react to the mix.

Quote from Prince of Slytherin but I fully agree. The stuff the Dursley's did to Harry would mess him up for good if this was real life.

That said, the author of PoS notes that “young child has abusive relatives but overcomes them to end up fine” is a staple trope in british fiction. Oliver Twist, Harry Potter, Matilda, James and the Giant Peach, A Series of Unfortunate Events, etc.
