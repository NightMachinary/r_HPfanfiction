You always see posts about the all too common evil dumbles trope, and though I stay far away from those stories, I would very much like to read a fic where dumbledore is a long term villain.

I don't mind if dumbledore is the main villain and voldemort is ignored entirely, or if Harry has to deal with both threats at once and struggles. Essentially, I want to read about a competent Harry trying to outsmart an even more competent villain.

Slash is fine, any pairing is OK.
