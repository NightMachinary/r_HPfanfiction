It's an easy mistake to make, the pronunciation is similar enough to get mixed up if you're not thinking about it. Also notice that the Self-Killing Curse is just the Kill-Others Curse written backwards.\\
A Hogwarts student from a couple of centuries back came up with the idea of using spell incantations backwards to try and get reverse spells and counterspells...95% of the time he blew himself up instead, and Arvadek Adava was no exception.


** Lord Voldemort strode into the small bedroom where baby Harry Potter lay. The Mudblood mother of the child stood in front, shielding him with her body, wand nowhere in sight. The Dark Lord allowed a smirk to cross his face. Foolish girl, she no doubt left it behind in the mad dash upstairs to protect her baby. Though he doubted that even if armed, she would fare much better than her pathetic blood-traitor husband.

He tolerated her self-sacrificial pleas, and even toyed with the idea of leaving her alive, if only to let her watch as he killed her child. After a few seconds, her whining became irritating enough that he discarded this plan. Pointing his wand, he spoke.

"Avada Kedavra."

Like all before her, she fell, having breathed her last. Unfortunately, her fall led her to land on a folding table, toppling it over. The Dark Lord presumed this be a baby changing station by the vast quantities of baby powder flung into the air.

Voldemort let out an involuntary sneeze, cursing his luck. He recently found his atrophied nose to be particularly vulnerable to fine powders such as this. No matter, a simple silent Air-Clearing Charm took care of that problem. Now for the boy. He pointed his wand once more and drew a deep breath, preparing to end him like the boy's mother. Yet it would seem that some powder remained in his nostrils, for the words which emerged were instead:

"Arvadek Adava-choooo!"

For one, single, horrified heartbeat, the Dark Lord recognized the spell he spoke. His sneeze had twisted the Killing Curse into the far more obscure Self-Killing Curse. From his wand, a torrent of purple energy incinerated his body and ravaged his soul. The majority of what remained of Lord Voldemort flew painfully to Albania. The rest, having no other alternative, attached itself to the small baby now whining in his crib.

Many years later, Harry asked Dumbledore how exactly he had survived that night. The old wizard quickly decided that 'mother's love' would be better received than 'pure dumb luck'.

** And after Dumbledore declares that it was 'a mother's love' that saved Harry, Voldemort goes to extreme lengths to confirm that. This includes burning his host if Harry touches it, and making up the whole graveyard scene just so nobody will find out the truth.

** Darth Vader tapped on the chalkboard.

"What have we learned today?" he asked. Various aspiring Dark Lords raised their hands... except one.

"Tom!" Vader shouted, "where's your mind at! Come on, try answering this one, it's very important if you want to be a good Dark Lord of /any/ capacity in future!"

Tom swiftly turned back, hoping he wasn't caught copying Sauron's answer seven times.

"Don't carry weapons that can be used to kill yourself," Tom read what was written on board.

"Correct!" Vader started rubbing the board.

"Uh... Professor?" Tom raised his hand.

"What?"

"What about me? I carry a wand. It can be used to kill me at any time."

"These new Dark Lords and their moronic weapons," Vader muttered, "Back in my day..."

"Anyway. Well Tom, in that case... Try not losing your weapon, yes?"

"What if there exists a self destroying spell that I could use, theoretically, maybe?"

The class laughed.

Vader tried not to laugh at his students, they didn't need more discouragement, seeing as the whole society was against them.

"Then don't use the damned spell. Why are you always asking these questions?"

The class laughed again.

Tom sat back down, meekly. He ignored the way Joker was making faces at him.

____ Some time later ____

"Avada Kedavra!"

And the woman was dead. It was a pity she tried to protect her child, but, well, these were the problems you had to deal with, being a Dark Lord and all that.

He raised his wand at the child. He wasn't going to make the same mistakes that the other Dark Lords did. He would kill the boy now, and be done with the prophecy.

The smell of lilies in the room was irritating his nose.

"Arvadek Adava!" he sneezed.

Wait what?

In his last moments he only had time to think, "I have failed you, Master Vader."
