It seems like every time I post a prompt, someone has to comment "but that didn't happen in canon.".

Insert Peter Griffin voice "Who the h*** cares?". Fanfiction exists for a reason.


** Canon is the touchstone that connects hpff. Deviations are important to make original stories but they should be planned.

There are quite a few fanon things that people legitimately forget aren't canon: Draco was not reluctant to take the dark mark, house elves don't die when set free, transfiguration is permanent, the Potter's are not richer than the Malfoys, etc. Sometimes it seems like people really do need reminders.

*** Which is likely why some changes to canon are more tolerated. Take Aurors for example. Canon information on them is thin, so if you want to do a post-war Harry as an Auror story with lighter/campier tone in the vein of older James Bond movies it won't be all that controversial. Want to have Aurors depicted as detectives a la Sherlock Holmes? Or to have Aurors be grittier in tone and function like assassins like a magical Jason Bourne/Mitch Rapp or Courtland Gentry? Changing how Aurors are depicted would be less controversial than bashing, ice queen, Ron the Death Eater etc.

**** And yet Dudley had to get the pig tail surgically removed. And quintapeds are an entire species created by transfiguration (according to legend).

Transfiguration (when properly done - or done in an impressively faulty way) is implied to be permanent. It is the art of fundamentally changing things even at the molecular level. The reason this isn't as massively abused as we'd think it should at first glance is simply because it is really damn hard to do (especially at higher levels).

Untransfiguration, and I get that this part is just my headcanon, probably works by looking into the traces left by the original transfiguration (Magic always leaves traces - Dumbledore, Albus) and transfiguring something back to what it used to be.

** One of my biggest peeves in a lot of fanfiction is where they make big changes and then follow canon, especially in time travel fics. E.g. powerful Harry comes back in time to his first year. What does he do with all that power and knowledge? Waits until Quirrel goes after the stone to defeat him. Fights the basilisk after it takes Ginny. Allows Pettigrew to escape so that next year Voldemort can be resurrected. Etc.

*** It kind of sort of makes sense, the more you change the less your future knowledge is worth. A possible scenario off the top of my head - Harry kicks Quirrelmort's arse in a public display of power, thus revealing Voldemort's continued existence (the wraith), Draco reports it to Lucius who finds and resurrects V. 3 years early, Lucius then has no reason to plant a diary on Ginny, V. may also make a different horcrux instead of Nagini so that's /another/ unknown H. would need to search for, and things just spiral out from there. The government is in Lucius' pocket so nothing gets done despite H. convincing Amelia/Augusta/Dumbledore/God, V. builds his support base, but seeing as H. is more powerful than any normal 11 y/o is supposed to be he decides to do some rituals to improve himself, or make more inferi, oh by the way let's check on that horcrux, what do you mean R.A.B. o shit better move my other horcruxes (at least diary and snake/replacement, since H. probably destroyed all others by then). If you make V. a competent antagonist, then changing things while not being careful about it will lead to more problems than it's worth.

Quirrelmort is pretty harmless if left alone, I agree about basilisk, Pettigrew and Barty Crouch Jr. are both known quantities - if you change them then V. may use a different ritual and H. will have no control over what happens.

I agree that that future knowledge is super useful, but only to a point, otherwise what's the point of having it?

****** Not really. Mrytle died without a mark on her, easily symptoms of the killing curse btw, and we haven't a clue as to what, if any, measures the Ministry takes when examining a body. Hagrid was raising a giant venomous spider, and Myrtle's corpse, presumably, wasn't damaged in any way. It's not exactly a leap to assume a giant spider isn't responsible for sudden, untraceable death. Especially if Hagrid kept the thing locked away and told them so.

Myrtle's only knowledge of her murder is some hissing and giant yellow eyes. Considering it can kill you with it's gaze it's highly unlikely people actually know what the eye color of a basilisk is. Furthermore, Myrtle is mercurial on a good day. It's entirely possible he couldn't get anything meaningful out of her, and even if he did that doesn't necessarily say basilisk. You could argue that it points you in the right direction, but by that point the attacks had stopped, and he was already onto the culprit, but could hardly act autonomously without just cause.

Bricking up a wall isn't going to stop a wizard. It certainly won't stop a basilisk from getting around in the pipes. And if you don't a know a basilisk is responsible or that the entrance to the chamber is in that bathroom in particular, which would you brick it up?

Frankly I'm surprised you hadn't brought up a fairly damning piece of negligence, though it is retroactive in nature. Dumbledore knew Tom was a parselmouth the day he met him. He should have been suspect number 1 when the chamber opened the first time around.

Eyes and hissing alone are enough to solve the mystery since, as you pointed out, there is no physical injury to her body. There are probably not many magical creatures which hiss and kill without touching their prey.

It will, however, stop Ginny Weasley and the wall could serve as a tripwire to detect anyone going there. And it doesn't matter that the basilisk moves through pipes, it can't get out of a faucet or toilet.

That basically describes half of what Dumbledore does though. But you are not taking this thought far enough. If hissing was the only thing Myrtle heard a boy say and she showed symptoms of the killing curse, that is basically a smoking gun for Riddle killing her without any monster.

******** He didn't convince anyone of anything, considering Hagrid was the first person they went to when the chamber was reopened. It's not Dumbledore's fault the Ministry ignored the facts as they are. In all likelihood they saw that the death stopped Hagrid's arrest and wiped their hands of the mess.

Actually, I was wrong. Myrtle describes hearing a different language, not hissing. So yellow eyes and a different language, which is even less helpful than hissing. So really just yellow eyes, which certainly doesn't point to Tom Riddle, or anyone else for that matter.

Would it though? Dairy Tom was puppeteering her body at the time, he certainly has spells that can knock down a wall when no one's around. Even if he didn't have that great a control over her body he could have easily bided his time and sucked her dry, and then unleash the basilisk proper on an unprepared school, which would be even worse.

#+begin_quote
  One of the most characteristic attitudes of the popular public towards its literature is this: the writer's name and personality do not matter, but the personality of the protagonist does. When they have entered into the intellectual life of the people, the heroes of popular literature are separated from their literary origin and acquire the validity of historical figures.

A fact about a character is true because it has deeply ingrained itself into our collective consciousness, not because Rowling says its true. Canon is only true to the extent which it agrees with fanon. Case in point, wizards and witches didn't use to shit on the ground and vanish the evidence.

When people ask for Canon compliant stories they aren't asking for Severitus.

When discussing what happened in Harry Potter no one is asking what happened in a fanfic, they're asking what happened in the books/movies. I agree that JK Rowling isn't the be all end all of Harry Potter, but the whole point of Canon is to solidify and nail down what happened, what the source of a work wrote in said work. JK is the source of Harry Potter, for good or ill.

And because she's the source, then yes, what she says about the source material is the truth of it. A person can take that however they choose, or not at all. The beauty of fanfiction and fandom is you can take and leave whatever you do or don't like, and that's wonderful to me. But not all 'facts' are valid and equal. Not when discussing events that actually happened in the source material. If someone wants to believe Harry had an affair with Fleur Weasley then that's their prerogative, but to expect me to just nod my head and say that happened just because someone wrote a fanfic about it is nonsense.

******* It's not nonsense, but zack is taking a very “line in the sand” approach to media -“my opinion is correct and anyone who disagrees is uneducated” sort of thing.

The view that zack is (poorly) spouting is referred to as “death of the author” - when reading or viewing some kind of media, it doesn't matter what the author intended for a work to mean, only how the audience perceives it. In the case of JKR, an example would be all the tweets she puts out. Using this lens, none of those should be considered canon, or even relevant. Another facet would be considering things that are implied by the media to be your head canon. What this view does NOT represent is discarding what is written in the books because it doesn't align with your interpretation, or your fan fiction, or what have you.

The opposite of this is “authorial intent” - which is what it sounds like. The media should be considered with the lens of what the author /meant/ it to mean, rather than projecting your own experiences onto the work. Taken to its extreme, it is regarding the authors views on the media as word of god - JKR said they shit on the floor, therefore they shit on the floor.

Attempting to read anything purely with one or the other is pretty much impossible, everyone falls on a spectrum between the two, especially with the Internet existing. What is very baffling is when people use death of the author to selectively that their head canon is somehow more canonical than actual canon.

******** Alright. Now that I'm on my computer instead of on the toilet, I am going to try and give a better explanation.

Essentially, my argument boils down to the question of “What even is a character?” In the quote I cited, Gramsci claims that once a work has been consumed by the masses characters transcend “from their ‘literary' origin” and develop “the validity of a historical figure.” Characters effectively become the subject of modern myths, and the core facts of these myths in our collective consciousness -- the cultural mythos surrounding them - is the true essence of the character.

In a world where the official books are the sole literary work in which the characters appear, this theory of the character aligns nicely with the traditional canon/non-canonical framework, as nothing else influences the development of the myth. However, what happens when secondary and tertiary authors re-tell the existing story or create new stories with these existing characters?

The canonist would argument that we should simply brush these derivative works (here, I mean all derivative works, including the movies, not just fanfiction) aside as irrelevant, but the fact remains that these works exist, were consumed by the public, and influenced the mythos of the characters. Since the public, not Rowling, controls the mythos of the characters, tropes that are repeated in derivative works enough to engrain themselves in a character's mythos (aka fanon), become “true facts” about said character. Through multiple generations of this creative cycle, characters evolve into something other than what was conceived by the original author. Cinderella, Snow White, and Batman loose their murderous tendencies, and Daphne Greengrass goes from being just an name to being a fully fleshed out pureblood political savant.

*** My point exactly! Case in point, magical peerages. So what if canonically, the only self proclaimed lord was Voldemort? Do you really see a universe in which Malfoy and co wouldn't jump at the chance to claim a title?

**** It relies on muggle acknowledgement. Something the Malfoys turned away from when the Statue of Secrecy went up. There's some info about it on both Pottermore and the HP wiki. Details, details about the world, not events. That's what's being referred to when people bring up canon in these sorts of discussions.

****** The info came out before Cursed Child and whatever other drama surrounds Rowling these days, and it is her work anyways; canon is often determined by the author regardless of what we fans think.

******* Which is probably one reason fanfiction is so popular. If the author says something that makes no sense, right it your way.

******** The Malfoy's background doesn't conflict with anything; it fits right in with everything else and fleshes out more details of a world before the Statue of Secrecy.

Also, if that were the case, Curse Child would be most beloved. People often call it fanfiction, so no, I disagree that that's the reason fanfiction is popular. If a series is popular, people decide to play in the sandbox of said series. They do so because they love the series and want to spend more time with it. In essence, it's popular because of whatever authors have created, i. e. canon.

** Because "It's not canon so it's bad" sounds less stupid than "I don't like it so it's bad".

That most of the people posting this ignore any part of canon they don't like (like enchanted trunks, magic power etc.) is just the icying on the hypocrisy cake.
