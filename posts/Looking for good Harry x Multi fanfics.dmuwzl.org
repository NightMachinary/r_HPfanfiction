Heyo, I know that most of you don't like Harems or ?xMulti pairings, but I do, it is one of my favourite genres, but recently I have been wanting to read on and on about Harry Potter fanfictions... maybe its something different, although I only vaguely know the HP universe, I have only watched the movies.

Anyway, I am looking for some good fanfics with the main focus being on Harry/Multi *No Yaoi*. I don't care if it is time-travel or not. Maybe even its a Harry x MILF pairing, even unconventional ones. Hell Harry can be dominant or rather dark and I would not care.

Link me some, any would be appreciated.

BTW - Luna best girl

#+begin_quote
  What's a girl to do when somewhere out there, there's a boy and every scar he gets appears on her body? When he's being abused? Hermione Granger, for one, is determined to find him and save him. Fourth Year. There's a big event at Hogwarts this year. The DOM is interested in the bonded. Darkness looms, old enemies return to haunt them and new foes make life more difficult.

** Hmmm... there are a LOT. It's very common, but I will recommend one, since they are very easy to search for. It's called The Paradox Coven series from bayushi, complete with art!

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1001727][The Paradox Coven]]

It should be pretty easy to follow for anyone, even if you don't know much about HP, the art also helps put things into perspective.

**** It's decent, very smutty, as are most of Harry/Multi fics.

But yeah, I don't like them that much. Most harem fics are just badly written, this is one of the exceptions, since it actually has a plot amid all the sex.

** Have you checked the list here?.. [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/browse.php?type=categories&catid=122]]

I can recommend “HP and the Witches Secret by RotaryFile“ [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=87]]

Or “The Harem War by: Radaslab” [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5639518/1/The-Harem-War]]

Or “Animagus Mishap! by dragen” [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=530]]

** The best two have already been linked here (Power of Seven, Paradox Covern). There's "It could only happen to Harry" but despite its length there's not much plot in it. Good writing though. "Harry's Black Book" on AFF is pretty similar in that regard.

Most multi fics have horrible characters and are therefore not enjoyable IMO. I don't mind Harry sleeping his was through half of Hogwarts, but if every witch looks like a porn star and has as much character depth as a tea spoon, I'm out.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.
