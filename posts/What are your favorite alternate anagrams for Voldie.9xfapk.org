What I'm talking about is, in canon (English), I AM LORD VOLDEMORT <====> Tom Marvolo Riddle.

Have you read any fanfic that rewrites this relationship to produce an anagram in a different way? (I know of at least one fic-set that posits that there was no anagram at all, and Tom's middle name is "Morfin", but that isn't really what I'm talking about here... this is, more like, curiosity what sorts of things other authors have come up with, in efforts to have their own anagram-building fun :) )

I'm especially curious what, if anything, folks have come up with an alternate anagram for a /genderflipped/ Riddle's evil overlord name, if she has a typically feminine first name, if such a fic exists ^^

Fic-set? As far as I know, it was a specific quirk of /Methods of Rationality/ --- though, of course, it shows up in fanfanfics thereof.

But actually, one of [[/r/HPMOR]] first reactions to the revelation of the "Morfin" thing in said story was to try to make up an anagram that works with Tom Morfin Riddle. They came up with "Mr Noodledrift", which I find absolutely hysterical. "/YOU/'re the Heir of Slytherin --- you're Mr Noodledrift!! "NOODLEDRIFT IS MY PAST, PRESENT... AND FUTURE!.........okay maybe this was a bad idea BUT I'M STICKING TO IT AVADAKEDAVRA!"

And haha, that's awesome, I wasn't around back when that info first dropped so I missed all that. I am amused! :)

**** Second Level of Understanding of Noodledrift: /this/ is why he then decided to become He Who Must Not Be Named. Because it was too late to change his Dark Lord name but he could at least limit the damage.

Third Level of Understanding of Noodledrift: It may be funny to idiots but the name of the Dark Lord Noodledrift should strike fear in all intelligent people. Because this is a man so evil and powerful that he can afford to be called Noodledrift, /and he still have loyal miniosn and people who are terrified of him/.

  Hermione gives a lecture on "gender-flip fanfiction"; i.e. fanfiction depicting an AU where one or more characters has been born the opposite sex. Of course, when the ones attending the lecture are Harry and Ron... or should that perhaps be "Holly" and "Ronnie"?... it might get a little difficult to stay on track. A very meta story.
