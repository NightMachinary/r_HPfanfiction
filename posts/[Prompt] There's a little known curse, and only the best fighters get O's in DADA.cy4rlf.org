Like the DADA professorship curse.

Curses in Harry Potter seem to be able to affect actions, such as causing a professor to leave the position every year.


** I don't get it.

Elaborate, please?

Edit: Okay, but the part I'm confused about is how that's different from the normal course of things. DADA is about fighting the "dark arts," and Os are by all accounts really hard to get, so you would expect only the best fighters - the people who are the best at practical defense as well as theory - to be the ones getting Os. No curse necessary.

Or do you mean something else by "best fighters"?

*** So, you know how the defense curse causes professors to leave for a variety of reasons after a year? I was looking for a prompt where an O, through no one's fault, is only given to the best person at defense. Like 1 person, every year. It may look like someone will get an O, then bam, they're in the hospital wing.

** As in, it makes it so everyone else gets dumbed down? Or is it literally a curse as in the professors cant give anyone but the best fighter an O.

I'm imagining Umbridge trying to fail Harry yet she keeps writing an O on all his assignments etc. She is constantly trying to put him down yet every time she hands homework back, Harry is the only one with full marks, leading to everyone thinking she is secretly against the Ministry by favourting Harry.

*** More like the curse makes it so events conspire so the best one gets an O.

It's not actually that far from canon, as Harry made the only known O in his year, and it's a popular fan theory that Snape let students with EE's in the class attend because otherwise it'd be a class of one.

The Umbridge thing sounds hilarious though.

Everyone just accepts it as /normal/.

*** I'm confused.

Like the curse Voldemort put on the DADA position. There's been plenty of powerful wizards and witches in history.
