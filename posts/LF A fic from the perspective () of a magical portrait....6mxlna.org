It was extremely dark, and based on the general fanon assumption that a magical portrait is a (fairly) high-quality copy of an individual's personality and memories.

The story involved Harry (?) creating a portrait of the Dursley family, and possibly several other people, in order to torture the portrait-copies of those people, and get revenge.


** Wow that is Dark!!! I've read one that's (fairly) canon compliant but has portrait Snape in love with Harry all from the portrait POV. But it's just a sad fic and not all revenge-y. Yours sounds really interesting!
