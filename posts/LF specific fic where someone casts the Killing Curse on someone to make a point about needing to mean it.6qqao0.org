I think they cast it on Hermione, and everyone freaked the hell out before they realized she wasn't dead. I can't remember who cast it though, may have been an OC.


** [[/u/deaththealien]] found it. For some reason, it isn't showing in the comments.

#+begin_quote
  Death wants free of its Master and proposes sending Harry back in time to avoid the unnecessary deaths in fighting Voldemort. Harry readily accepts, thinking he'll start anew as a Firstie. Instead, Harry's soul, magic, and memories end up at the beginning of Second Year --- in GILDEROY LOCKHART!

** I can just picture this happening. "You can cast the killing curse and it won't do anything unless you truly mean the person to die. For example!" As he aimed his wand at the child he accidentally thought of the last essay the spawn turned in to be marked ("Wy kurs ar bad 4 u by A Student. Kurs ar very bad 4 u kuz day hurt lots. Kurs ar god to us aganst enmes.") "Avada Kedavra!" He said the words, his wand flashed green and the student dropped dead.

** that was the dumbest shit. if the killing curse didn't always kill then there would have been several boys and girls who lived in history. harry was the first which was why he was famous.

*** But, that's canon. Fake Moody said that the students could cast it at him and he wouldn't even get a nose bleed. You have to want to use the Unforgivables.

**** no that's not canon and it's not what he says.

he says they could wave their wands and say the words and nothing would happen but a nosebleed. the obvious meaning that if you don't mean it you simply fail to cast the spell.

**** He says that they're unable to cast it because it requires considerable power. I assume that this is the same power that Voldemort's boat measures and which is somehow tied to age.
