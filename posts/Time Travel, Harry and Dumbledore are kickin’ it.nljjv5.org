I've read a fair share of time travel fics and I've grown a bit tired of all the bashing, any fics where Harry time travels and becomes a good friend of Dumbledore's? Doesn't have to be the premise. Thanks everyone!

  The fiasco at the Department of Mysteries had many consequences. One accident with a time-turner sent Harry to a faraway past. But who can really he rely on in this farce of home? And should he really trust Albus Dumbledore to have his best interests at heart?Harry was going to go back to his time. Back to 1996. He was going to go back to the Department of Mysteries. He was going to save his friends, and everybody in his time whose existence is being threatened.But how? At what price?And what will be left of him in the end?

** I read one, harry got transported 100 years in past and become Nicolas flamels's Apprentice, this interesting fic is left incomplete when harry becomes friends with a 16 years old Albus Dumbledore and Elphies doge while he was hanging with a teenage Garrick Ollivanders in diagon alley. Very nice world building.
