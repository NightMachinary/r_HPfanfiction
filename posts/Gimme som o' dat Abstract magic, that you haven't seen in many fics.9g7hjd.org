** If you want an interesting Neil Gaiman-esque take on magic, you can't go wrong with Ectomancer by RustyRed. It is, unfortunately, unfinished, but the 100K words that are there are fantastic. If I could choose one unfinished fic to magically be finished out of all the fics I've read, it'd be this one.

  Falling through puddles and magic gone haywire are just a few of Harry's newest problems. With the Ministry falling apart and Voldemort unearthing ancient secrets, will Harry uncover the truth in time? Post-OotP.
