** Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4315906/1/Dumbledore-s-Army-and-the-Year-of-Darkness]]

It's the story of Neville's year under the Carrows at Hogwarts and it's what got me into fanfiction. It's incredible.

**** Harry Potter and the Last Horcrux has a pretty awesome portrayal of the Second War, with a more mature trio taking on Voldemort and his minions. The best H/Hr I've ever read.

Indifference and Neglect starts off all angsty, but has a positive and somewhat cracky ending. Lots of bashing as far as I remember, but it was entertaining enough for me. Oh, and it's also H/Hr. I think I see a trend here...

** Start here: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/DLP-5-Starred-and-Featured-Authors/84507/99/4/1/0/0/0/0/][DLP 5 Starred and Featured Authors]]

Everything on there is readable and you'll find every classic people recommend on that list.

The list is the work of [[http://www.darklordpotter.net][Dark Lord Potter]], a forum that's pretty much devoted to weeding out all the shitty fanfiction, so I'd recommend poking around there too.

** We'll start out with the classics:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5554780/1/Poison-Pen][Poison Pen]] is about Harry taking an original route to victory. Funny, well written and awesome.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish][Make a Wish]] is Harry hearing about the prophecy, and doing the sensible thing... running for his life. But of course, he's Harry Potter, and trouble follows him everywhere. Light and humorous, IMO, the best super!Harry story out there.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6413108/1/To-Shape-and-Change][To Shape and Change]] is basically the most popular Snape-mentors-Harry fic. Snape goes back in time after the victory cost far too much, and decides to use his knowledge to prepare Harry in the best way possible.

Those three are considered must-reads, and the first two are among my favorites (because I don't really like the Snape-mentors-Harry thing).

Now, for the stuff that is IMO mind-blowingly awesome:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]] is quite possibly the best story in fan fiction history. It's funny, dramatic, angsty, adventerous... no real main characters, but all the characters are so well developed and awesome. I could gush about it's strong points for ages, but seriously, it is amazing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A-Difference-in-the-Family-The-Snape-Chronicles][A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles]] follows the life of Severus Snape from the moment his parents moved into Spinner's end to his death. It is perhaps the single greatest character piece out there. So little is known about the character, what makes him act like he does... but here we get a perfect explanation. Harry gets to Hogwarts only half-way through the story, and even then, he is not the focus. The most mature read of the bunch.

[[https://www.fanfiction-junkies.de/efiction/viewstory.php?sid=2377][Practical Solutions]] is all about funny dialogue and social awkwardness. And sex jokes. Lots and lots of sex jokes. Starring Hermione Granger and Severus Snape, two workoholics unashamedly lacking is social skills, not looking for a relationship, but rather something more practical.

**** You really can't go wrong with any of them. You are relatively new, so reading these will tell you what to look for... and it helps that even the one I like least here is head and shoulders above the average.

Then again, I haven't recommended what Jean-Jacques Russo defined as "one handed reading". Those exist as well. There are also the "we hate Snape" stories, but after reading The Snape Chronicles, I can't really hate him (yes, that story is /that/ good), so I can't recommend those honestly.

******* Ok. Here are some that I have enjoyed.

1.[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233539/1/The-Last-Marauder][The Last Marauder]] - Hermione goes back to the marauders 3rd year and ends up replacing Peter. HermionexLupin.

2.[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Houses Divided]] - Teddy Lupin's first year at hogwarts is not as smooth as one would think. Brilliant story by the author of the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick series]], which I am currently enjoying.

3.[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5200789/1/The-Life-and-Times][The Life and Times]] - Marauders, LilyxJames. Lots of characters, really feels accurate as to what I think their relationship was like before they got together. Only bad thing is that it's unfinished and she hasn't updated in a year.

********* I like what I've read so far (I'm a few chapters into the 3rd book.) It has the same premise as HP (kid enters magic world and goes to magic school) but it's different enough so it doesn't feel like hp:America. The magic world is different in america and the author does show that. The story line is good and there have been some interesting plot twists that I didn't see coming. the characters are ok, some could do with improvement but it doesn't detract from my enjoyment so far. TL;DR I would recommend giving the first book a try before you make up your mind.

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2032067/1/Abandon][*Abandon* by Batsutousai]] is one of my favorites. It's also the only fic that I've enjoyed under "Humor".

Here's the summary: "Abandoned on the streets of London, 16 year old Harry Potter must find a way to survive. What's the Boy Who Lived to do?"

It also has a sequel:[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2474430/1/Reclaim][Reclaim]]

The pairing is *Harry/Voldemort*, but don't let that throw you. It does a very good job of making you not even realize that it *isn't* canon.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/577769/Batsutousai][Batsutousai]] has written a lot of slash for our fandom. If you enjoyed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2032067/1/Abandon][Abandon]], I highly recommend reading some of her other fics.

Santi went away to law school, but there are nearly twice as many chapters posted in the DLP Work By Author section as there are posted on fanfiction.net. They've been beta'd and gone over by the DLP community but haven't had (debatably) the third pass that the previous chapters did.

As one of the betas, I think the later chapters were every bit as creative and fantastic as the early ones. Brilliant story that remains one of the most rereadable in the fandom, to me.
