** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11111990/1/Grow-Young-with-Me][Grow Young With Me]], linkffn(11111990), is good, but hasn't been updated in a long time.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), is also good, but Harry relationship with his wife is increasingly marred by politics.

** There are two very similar ones... sadly neither of them are over 60K, but they're pretty good all the same. "Hocus Pocus, Adele Polkiss" and "Hero Complex" both star OC Muggle girls who befriend Harry and pretty much stay behind in the Muggle world while he goes to Hogwarts.

"Hero Complex" has an unfinished sequel called "Separation Anxiety."

#+begin_quote
  When muggle Kate Foster first met Harry Potter, he saved her...by breaking her fall. She knew then and there that he had a major hero complex. "I hope that you don't make a habit of this saving people thing. You aren't very good at it." She didn't know that he was a wizard, or that he was destined to save the world. Very slight Harry/OC.
