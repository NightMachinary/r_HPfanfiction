With several of the Death Eaters coming from prominent families, several likely very rich and influential how would you handle cleaning up after the war? Throughout history we have had several instances of peace treaties and the like where people have not been happy afterwards. While no such treaty will have been created there will have been laws and the like made after the war ended. Death Eaters would have to be tried and others will be suspected. One of my big complaints about the epilogue was how clean it felt.

What happens to the survivors, the blood suprematists and their families? Did they all die? Will they be hunted down? Will they be brought back into the fold? Will their complaints be dealt with in a rational manner, if so how do muggleborns and the like accept that? Voldemort might have been insane, he carved up his own soul but to write off his entire support base as insane is just lazy. Some of them will have joined for a fragment of his power, a few more might have joined because he looked like the winning side but others will have supported him ideologically. Do you imagine there were legitimate grievances that were just ignored leading them to join Voldemort or are they just nutters and bigots? Woul it go too far the other way, would muggleborns look to heavily restrict the pureblood movement, would they oppose that and gather around a new leader to restart the conflict even if its just politically?

How much of the wizarding economy was propped up by bribes etc how would they cope without those? Without the Death Eaters be allowed to buy their freedom so their money could be used to rebuild. Would the public be out for blood?

Please tell me how you see the aftermath happening?


** The Battle of Hogwarts created a huge power vacuum as a result. Not only did most Voldemort's Inner Circle and Death Eaters go down, even the Ministry's own forces had to be decimated since Minister Thickness himself was drafted to the frontline. This Battle had to be so bloody that JKR skimmed [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/54c4y9/battle_of_hogwarts/d80mg1b/][those gory details]] mostly. By default, the DA and what remained of the Order became the only credible and organized military after the Battle.

Harry had to be truly incensed about the torture Hogwarts children had suffered, and especially furious about what Neville and Ginny went through. They, along with hundreds of similarly angry parents and fellow students, would get themselves organized and demand a thorough purge of the Ministry and the Wizengamot, and thorough punishments for ALL Death Eaters and Voldemort sympathizers. The Ministry would be in no shape to resist their wraths.

I think their entire generation was fed up by the failures of their predecessors, and wanted to do things THEIR WAY. Core DA members had to come to an understanding after the War, that things in Magical Britain were no longer sustainable and revolutionary changes had to take place. Many more traumatized people of magical Britain would also demand massive changes and reforms in the Ministry. One of its major shortcoming during both wars was the lack of effectiveness of its police/military force. JKR herself mentioned "revolutionary changes" in the DMLE. That could mean vast expansion of police powers and significant improvements in investigative techniques. Furthermore, Kingsley worked on the staff of Muggle prime minister and should be highly familiar with Muggle government organizations. He would now be in a position to create a magical equivalent of MI6/SIS.

After the First War, the public went easy on Voldemort's sympathizers, and watched where that led to. But as the phrase 'Fool Me Once, Shame on You; Fool Me Twice, Shame on Me!' goes, they would more likely to go overboard this time. Harry and his friends, in their zeal to prevent the rise of another Voldemort, might have created a much more controlling government as the result. Harry apparently was very successful in his job, since he became the youngest police chief ever in 2007. He seemed to often fight on the front lines himself, and would have earned the loyalty of his troops. It would not be too far fetched to consider Aurors to be his private army.

If you look at what the main 4 were doing 20 years later, you should identify a pattern: Hermione set the policies, Harry led the police/military, Ron made the money, and Ginny controlled the media. In case of Ginny, her job as Senior Quidditch Reporter was most likely a ruse. Do you really believe Daily Prophet would dare to ignore the 'wishes' of police chief's wife and Minister's sister-in-law? Do you really think anyone there dared to oppose her who put another senior reporter in hospital just because that person made fun of them?

It's just the trouble with leadership and control in general - there's a knife's edge of balance and it is easy to slip in either direction.

And, to ask - which government during the Great Depression? There were many - especially in the "Western" communities - that differed.

****** I think the previous commenter meant the US government, who had instituted wide reaching government programs and regulations after FDR was elected.

--------------

In my version of postwar magical Britain, I see the government tightening in following areas:

- Expansion of police and surveillance powers
- Increased protection of Muggles, which meant more surveillance of magic use in the country (actually very important for maintaining SoS, ICW would like it)
- Zero tolerance toward Blood Purity ideology
- Vetting of Ministry staffs and of positions in other public institutions
- Anti-discriminatory laws (e.g punishments for denying services to Muggleborns, half-breeds, and other magical creatures)
- Establishment of an intelligence agency as a counterpart to MI6 (Auror office would be the equivalent of MI5)
- More Ministry involvements in investigating criminal activities at Hogwarts

But the government would be more accommodative in other areas:

- Turning the Wizengamot into a democratically elected body (my head canon says it used to be hereditary)
- Separation of legislature and judiciary (Wizengamot used to assume both roles)
- Equal legal status for all sapient magicals
- Social welfare programs for disadvantaged magicals, such as foster care for orphaned children
- More involvement and representation for parents of Muggleborn students, such as periodic visits of Hogwarts, demonstrations of magic by their children, legal status in wizard court...
- Remove Dementors once and for all

*** How to finish off Voldemort's remnants would be a delicate matter, consider following cases:

1) Ex Snatchers A and B were opportunistic thugs through and through, and decided to exploit Ministry's temporary lack of manpower to curry favor with the new regime. After all, that Potter kid offed the immortal Dark Lord and that Weasley matriarch killed the dreaded Lestrange Bitch in single combat. Such powers were not to be trifled with. Better join them now when they still needed people. Cook up some sorry tales about being press-ganged (partly true) and deliver some marked ones to the Ministry would set you up nicely.

2) The Dark Lord's Inner Circle was among the richest of magical Britain, pissed off winners would undoubtedly make them PAY. Poor Death Eater C didn't have much gold, hadn't really committed any major crime apart from a few vandalism and a couple imperiuses for fun. On the bright side, he happened to know a fleeing Inner Circle member's hideout, so C stood a good chance in avoiding prison if he turned early. He might even profit handsomely if he offed that inner circle member.

3) Ministry bureaucrat D was a believer in blood purity, although D rarely expressed his/her opinions publicly. However, D had access to many Muggleborn addresses, and D happily supplied these to Voldemort's regime. After the Battle, he/she tried to escape justice by staying low again, like last time, but his victims were not that easily fooled.

How should the above people be punished (or rewarded)?

*** fantastic write up! This is exactly what I think would happen as well, and it makes me really happy that someone expressed it. The first 2 paragraphs are definitely a bit understated among other discussion sometimes, good points.

I think that the Aurors were mostly FBI-esque, but I bet now there will be specializations like you mentioned, with a CIA branch/intelligence gathering effiency development, and some sort of SAS group. The Hitwizards would have to then adjust their responsibilities as well.

I think something we haven't touched on is foreign relations with other ministries, and the lack of intervention or lack of communication. I'm sure its because Fudge delayed any progress by denial, but even after getting sacked we get no canon for it. I think that besides any reasonable fanon for HBP int'l relations, we will see a huge boon in int'l relations come the New Wave in the ministry. I think that we'll see the understaffed ministry get huge infusions of staff, money, and updated magical infrastructure akin to the WWII rebuilding era from governments around the world.

You bring up a good point about Ginny. *Digression*: I had this idea of some interesting one shot where Ginny is too limited by the market monopolizing Daily Prophet and is continually seeing how their revenue source has increasingly pushing their institutional gossip/rumor mill agenda specific to each department, and ends up joining another paper, poaching all the best sports journo talent (and eventually more) and weakening the Daily Prophet's market and cultural domination. *Anyways*, your point about Ginny's inherent power gave me pause, and made me think about how she really does have sway. How she uses it would be interesting, because while the paper could definitely fold under the pressure of her connections, it could definitely swing the other way if things become unpopular for whatever the Ministry is doing vs the Prophet readerbase demographic.

It's funny you say Harry's private army, because while Aurors are usuallymuch less about direct fights than say, hitwizards (right?), his Aurors could be his Special Ops or SWAT team, if you wanna run within this fun idea.

**** That depends on how thoroughly the Death Eaters are rooted out, and how much of an effort is done to stomp out blood bigotry. If you are too lenient, you'll likely end up with another war - as was shown with the Death Eaters happily flocking to Voldemort as soon as he returned. Other examples include the backlash against Afro-Americans in the South after the Union Army left the ex-confederated states.

If you're too harsh, you might end with a "Hitler"-type persona who capitalizes on the disgruntled public after the treaty of Versailles - which was a big talking point of Hitler.

It's all a hard balancing-act. A big problem is that the Nürnberger Prozesse (Nuremberg Trials) had tried 200 just as the elite, and in similar trials over 1600 others were tried. That would be a sizable chunk of the wizarding population that would need to be tried, and a lot of people were killed, there is polyjuice, alibis are unreliable (Time-Turners and polyjuice) and everything is a huge clusterfuck. Death eaters are as ruthless (or even more ruthless in some cases) than the Nazi party was, so fear for your family was real.

The lenient approach hadn't worked last time, so maybe a more harsh approach is appropriate? What is the right balance? I'm totally for using veritaserum for all suspected adults, and also questioning them about suspected others - basically a 'web of distrust'. If you get accused by enough death-eaters that obviously can't resist veritaserum you're out, no matter what you can do.

The thing is: No method is perfect. The more strict you get, the more likely you'll get innocents. It's really a bad situation. I'd just hope that the worst offenders died during the Battle of Hogwarts.

****** I'm currently writing a story dealing with the aftermath of an alternate Second Blood War. (The original idea was to start at the end of the war and handle the war in flashbacks, but that was dropped in the planning phase, and the story started with the lead-up to the war, then covered the war and is now in the aftermath stage.) It's just one of the possible ways to handle it - I've written other stories with different endings - but it's the first story of mine that focuses on all the trouble following a civil war.

linkffn(11910994)

I'd say most characters who lived through the war would not show much mercy to Death Eaters and their supporters. Not after showing mercy led directly to the second war. Harsh punishment, confiscation of wealth, and a campaign to wipe out blood purity as a culture would be their demands. How much of that they can push through depends on how powerful the bigots are, relative to the muggleborns and blood traitors, and how much purebloods bought into Voldemort's propaganda.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** Before going into my thoughts on what may have happened after the battle, I just want to say that I am torn about wanting Rowling to actually write a narrative about this time period.

On one hand, it is infinitely interesting to read about what happens next, both on a very personal, character-driven level and on a more macro-level. Harry and the others have just gone through an incredibly emotional experience and now can focus on themselves without the specter of Voldemort getting in the way.

How does Harry cope with the possible survivor's guilt? What about the fact that he completed his life's purpose at 17. Does he pick up with Ginny right away or do they struggle to come back together? How does their relationship even work with everything that's happened? How does he deal with being vindicated but also now the most famous and admired wizard in the world?

On the larger scale, how do they round up the Death Eaters and how do they go about pursuing justice in a world run by bribes, fear and enough bigotry to allow such persecutions of muggle-borns? How do they bring muggleborns back into society? How does kingsley reform a corrupt Ministry? How does he balance justice, freedom and security? Does he restrict freedom of the press since the press was complicit in allowing Voldemort's rise in the first place?

These questions are really interesting! But...

If Rowling were to actually try to tackle this story, it would vastly different in tone than the original series. And then, is it really Harry Potter or something different? Harry Potter worked and was so beloved because a series of different elements created it. My fear is that actually writing something that explores this post-battle world takes away the magic that made the series so great.

Regarding my thoughts on what actually happened, I think it was a very tough balancing act between seeking justice on those who were Death Eaters and sympathizers and not falling into another repressive regime that stifled the rights all in the name of restoring order. The actual heroes of the war, specifically Harry and the DA, were still too young to take control. They all either went back to school or entered the Ministry at low-level positions. I'm sure Kingsley wisely decided to get so many into positions to start rooting out the old elements, and I'm also sure a lot of the Ministry staff either fled, were arrested, or otherwise had disappeared from their roles, necessitating a lot of new blood to fill them. People who sympathized with Voldemort were ousted and people like Arthur Weasley elevated.

Since Rita Skeeter is canonically still around years later, my guess is the press was largely left alone.

I think years after the battle, the DA is still widely popular and thus the reforms Hermione wants to push are able to be made.

The big issue that I'm not sure they solve is what to do about the families of death eaters. You need to reintegrate them into society, but judging by how Draco is treated in CC, I doubt society allowed that.

*** At the very least, they should have rubber stamped Hermione's house elf reforms right away, and then hired her at a high position in the Ministry upon her gradutation. She might be young, but too many Ministry employees have disgraced themselves irrevocably during the war. In a similar way, the DA should have formed - those willing - the backbone of the Auror force. With regards to the press, the Wizarding Press didn't need more freedom; it needed accountability. It was running rampant even before it became the Ministry's mouthpiece. I think those Death Eater family members who were not involved in crimes were integrated easily enough. Draco, which many seem to forget, committed horrible crimes before he finally changed sides. He almost murdered several people, was instrumental in letting a horde of monsters enter Hogwarts, and was a mouthpiece for Voldemort for years before that.

Since they made it to the top after 20 years, I guess the new story will be a mixture of "CSI", "Homeland", and "House of Cards". I thought about the "West Wing", but the politics in magical Britain were a lot dirtier and the struggles a lot deadlier. Probably JKR was probably right in not writing more, because there would be no way our heroes could avoid doing lots of nefarious things or 'necessary evil'. Politics and power struggles are inherently ugly, just following JKR on Twitter will give you an idea how much mud is being sling around, and she's not even fighting for control or engaged in personal life and death struggles.

After falling to 2 coups within 10 months, I think Ministry's authority and reputation were in tatters. First, it rolled over without a fight against Voldemort and his genocidal terrorists; then its own fighting force got destroyed mostly by teenagers. If this was a RL institution, it would become a laughing stock in the eyes of the public and lose its legitimacy. This Ministry had to be rebuilt from ground up.

In such revolutionary times, a coherent and organized armed force would be the ultimate arbiter of power. Purging the Wizengamot of the Old Regime and making it an elected body should be a first step.

** Colubrina's Lady of the Lake has the Order Of the Phoenix as corrupt, vindictive, and dissolute, but very much enjoying the fruits if victory by Pureblood expropriation. (She's a Slytherin AU writer, so a Ron-scorned Hermione and Malfoy organize a Slytherin countercoup against Griffin dorsal whose worst traits come on because they've not process the trauma of the war) but the politics feel as vicious as I'd expect.

Vera Rozalsky's Amends has that kind of phenomenon, too. Child soldiers dusting and bystanders wearing muggle clothes under open robes (it's a fashion, since Harry and Hermione did it) and a death squad in the Aurors killing Slytherins.
