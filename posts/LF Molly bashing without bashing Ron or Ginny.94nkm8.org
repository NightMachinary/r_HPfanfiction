Are there any good fanfics that bash Molly but not Ron or Ginny? No M ratings or slash pairings please.


** dunno if Backwards with Purpose counts, but Molly and Arthur are pretty much the only 'bad' Weasleys in it. Even Percy comes around iirc

*** I don't think I ever finished it. I dropped it around the time they walked in on younger Harry and Ginny banging and freaked out at him. Can you really blame them for freaking out that a family friend is having sex with your 12 year old daughter?

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6959724/1/Lunch-at-Maxine-s][Lunch at Maxine's]] - It's my favorite fanfic version of Hermione's mom. It's focused on the harmony pairing but it does have a somewhat bashed Molly.
