I remember that it was Dumbledore's idea, and they duel in the Great Hall in front of the entire school and it was pretty epic. Also I think Harry was Dunbledore's apprentice, maybe. Any help would be appreciated! :D

  Memories are tricky things. Sometimes, they cause us to lose nights of sleep. Sometimes, they bring light to darkness. Sometimes, they change the course of destiny. Set after the events of Fourth year. Follow Harry Potter as he finds his way across his strange problems, his notoriety and of course, the resurrected dark lord trying to kill him. AU. Powerful! Harry, Harry/Daphne.
