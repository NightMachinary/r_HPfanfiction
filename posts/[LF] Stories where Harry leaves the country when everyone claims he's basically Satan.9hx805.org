I can't think of any stories where Harry gets sick of the entire population of Magical Britain, spearheaded by Mr. Fudge, claiming that he's an attention seeking asshole, so he just decides to leave them to stew.

Has someone done this, or something vaguely similar?


** The authors cant think beyond hogwarts.

Every single one about him leaving always have him return for some inexplicable reason.

*** Because, otherwise that will be just an OC name Harry in a whole new setting, I have seen some labelled as crossovers that just has MC named Harry, the character can't even do magic.\\
Regarding his return, who would leave him to be content and anonymous in a strange land, many groups would be searching for him and someone will find him, and we as readers will always want some kind of closure. We need to know whats happening out there.

Bungle in the Jungle is a fun one, Cursebreaking in Brazil with Bill, has a sequel that returns to Britain, but is very off the rails and still see greater outside Britain than inside story.

I can offer you my own "Dawn of Darkness", where Harry leaves Britain after the Ministry tries to arrest him for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. There is very little debate whether or not to leave since staying would be rather pointless (with the Ministry and Voldemort hunting him), but Harry rejects the notion of simply relaxing on a Caribean beach in favour of trying to figure out why the Ministry is acting the way it does from abroad.
