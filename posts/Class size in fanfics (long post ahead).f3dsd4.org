I know that there has been much debate on the population of the wizarding world of England and I want to ask what representation you see as far as the children population in fanfics for class size.

Fics that start Harry from his first year:

I've noticed that in many fanfics class size isn't really acknowledged until the sortings or later in the story. In a few fanfics I've seen a character note the increase in first years their second or third year. But the class size of students from the students older than Harry's year is not usually indicated.

Here's my theory (hope it makes sense): the effects of the 1st war on England's, Scotland, etc. reproduction

[Harry's year](Born 1980)(1991) 1st Year- birthrate was healivly effected as there was constant fighting and attacks. This was not necessarily the time to have kids and many couples were killed.

(Born 1979)(1990)2nd Year- birthrate was heavily effected, but the number of kids born is slightly more than Harry's year. Many couples were killed.

(Born1978)(1989)3rd Year- birthrate is also considerably moderately effected.

(Born 1977)(1988)4th Year- birthrate shows a notable decrease and the violence of the war is open and dangerous for people to be out.

(Born 1976)(1987)5th Year- birthrate begins to decrease as the war starts to get openly violent and less isolated. Families have one child unless they have twins (noted that there aren't many siblings that aren't twins in Hogwarts in the age when Harry's first year starts)

(Born 1975)(1986)6th Year- birthrate was not really affected but their parents were beginning to question having young children during the violence that seems to be increasing

(Born 1974)(First year 1985)7th Year- birthrate was not really effected by the war since they were born well before Harry's parents graduated

Unless the fanfic strays from canon to give characters new and older siblings during their Hogwarts time, or the fanfic reveals that they have way older siblings after they graduation (post-Hogwarts fics), or the fanfic is and AU.

What do you think? I know some fics just blame the lack of children born on inbreeding, but if you know any that focus or talk about the population dwindling due to war let's discuss!


** [[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/numbers.htm][This link has been helpful]], but here are the highlights:

*What can we conclude about the number of students attending Hogwarts?*

If there are really eight hundred students then Harry's year seems to be exceptionally small - even more so if there are a thousand.

If, however, we discount JKR's initial estimate of a thousand students as just bad math, and go with her later figure of six hundred, that ties in quite well with an estimate derived from the number of carriages used to transport students from the train, and the population of Hogsmeade. That gives us a student body of around six hundred and forty during Harry's time at Hogwarts, and since Harry's year - conceived when Voldemort was at his most threatening - is clearly unusually small, in other decades the number would be closer to six hundred and sixty. Not all of these, however, have to be accommodated in the dormitories, as there should be around twenty Hogsmeade students per year and these probably live out.

For each house, then, there should be an average of around twenty-three or twenty-four students in a normal year, of whom about five are from Hogsmeade and probably live out. Taking the four houses together, in a normal year there should be about ninety-four students.

Harry's year is probably so unusually small because they are children conceived at the height of Voldemort's power. Witches and wizards presumably have better contraception than Muggles, so they would have the power to choose not to bear a child into a world at war, and probably many would so choose.

It's likely that the year below Harry's (Ginny and Luna's year) is also small. The year below that would be small to normal-sized but heavily weighted towards students born towards the end of the academic year, since there would be a low number of conceptions before Voldemort's fall and sharp rise after it as people celebrated, resulting in a rash of births in late July and August 1982. The year after that would probably be unusually large, thus balancing out the small year just below Harry.

So although the distribution between years would be uneven, by the time Harry reaches fourth year it is possible to work out the numbers as if there was one small year (Harry's) and the rest were fairly average, even though it would really go:

1st year - very large

2nd year - small to average, weighted towards July and August births

3rd year - very small

4th year - very small (Harry's year)

5th year - small to average

6th year - average

7th year - average

** This kinda ties into the class size--I always thought that the First Wizarding War was the reason why there were so many only children around Harry's age.

I'm an only child, so it's my normal, but I realized just how many only children there are. The ones confirmed by the books are: Harry, Hermione (obv not affected by the first war tho), Draco, Luna, Neville. But then we're never told that any of these kids have siblings: Seamus, Pansy, Theodore Nott, Blaise Zabini, Lee Jordan, Susan Bones.

** My understanding is HW classes are exactly 40 students per year, 5 boys and 5 girls in each of the 4 houses. With admission, this is easy as they just need to recruit 20 boys and 20 girls per year. HOWEVER, this makes the sorting rather troublesome as to keep the houses equally staffed, that would mean the last student sorted wouldn't really be sorted, but rather stuck into the last open spot.

My headcanon for this is that magical artifacts like the sorting hat do not experience time the same way we do. All sortings are, from the perspective of the hat, occurring at the same time. That also explains how the sword of Gryffindor keeps getting in there.

*** My headcanon is that the Sorting Hat sorts children completely randomly, the mental talk it sometimes gives is a completely made-up bluff, and the reason people are seemingly sorted so well according to their personalities/history/desires is a combination of the confirmation bias, Barnum effect, and realistic conflict theory; no matter in which House a child will be sorted into, it will probably feel 'right', and that House will soon turn into their in-group, shaping them even more to its characteristics, and finally fueling the rivalry between the Houses even more.
