Hey, I read a fanfic a while ago, where Fleur tries to use a love potion that her grandmere also used on her husband to make him subservient to her. I think Fleur tried to use it on Viktor Krum or Harry Potter?

Or any other fanfics with Fleur as a minor/major villain/manipulative character


** To Fight the Coming Darkness has Fleur as a minor villain, though you have to wait until about chapter 26 though.
