What are some good fics where Harry self-harms? One of my favorite ones is [[https://archiveofourown.org/chapters/39500218?show_comments=true&view_full_work=false#comment_265191697]["Doing the Wrong Thing"]], but it's a WIP.

â€‹

Preferable would be a somewhat realistic portrayal of the issues and *a lot* of angst. Can have a bad ending, but doesn't have to.

  Harry's doing just fine: being Quidditch Captain and 'the Chosen One' doesn't leave him with time to worry about much besides school and the growing threat of war. He's especially not worrying about the fact that Sirius is dead. Or about an embarrassing, uncomfortable night with a classmate he'd rather just forget. Really. He's fine. Features an eating disorder, other tags inside.
