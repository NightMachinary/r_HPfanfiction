I'm sort of getting tired with the whole, "no matter what, Hermione and Harry will be friends" trope I've been experiencing lately. Normally I have no problem with it, but it seems even in bashing fics, Hermione is always handled more gently than the other characters. She'll be the only one he forgives, or the only one who stays with him in the hard times, or the only one who goes with what he wants and avoids him. So I want stories where Hermione is in no way forgiven when she does the same thing as other characters and isn't painted as the sad girl who lost her friend and truly regrets everything she did.

Please no romance driven plot, mpreg, genderbending or pottercest. Thank you!


** Hermione is by far my favorite character, so I definitely dislike Hermione bashing.

On the other hand, I've read quite a few Hermione bashing fics too, some of them actually entertaining:

"A Cadmean Victory", linkffn(11446957): [[/spoiler][Fleur killed her in the end]]

"Find a Place to Call Home", linkffn(9885609): [[/spoiler][Hermione abandoned Harry after his name came out. Harry ran away with Astoria and never met her again]]

"Hail Odysseus", linkffn(10645463): [[/spoiler][Harry left Britain to Voldemort's mercy, and Hermione's fate was unknown]]

"My Slytherin Harry", linkffn(6160345): [[/spoiler][Hermione had no role in defeating Voldemort, and Harry only became neutral with her in the end]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1816754/sbmcneil][This author]] almost always bashes Hermione. "Realizations", linkffn(7875381), painted her and Ron in a very unflattering view.

  If things were different, and Harry was a Slytherin, and Ginny's parents had tried their best to keep her away from him, what would happen when she's finally had enough? Anti lots of people, Grey Harry.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
