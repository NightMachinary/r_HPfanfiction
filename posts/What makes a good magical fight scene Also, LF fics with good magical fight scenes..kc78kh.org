As the title says, this post has two parts.

*First, a discussion* - what do you think makes a good magical fight scene? What makes a bad one? Are there things that are important to account for when writing them? Are there absolute no-nos to never do?

*Second, a request* - what fics do you know that have good (or interesting somehow) magical fight scenes? I don't care about anything in the rest of the fic, I'm just looking for good fight scenes (so if you could also note down what chapter the fight scenes occur in, I'd be terribly grateful - no pressure to do so though, just my undying admiration for your kind-hearted souls :D).

As always, all relationships/pairings okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

** 1. Action scenes should tie into plot and character. If people are fighting just for fighting's sake than it's going to be boring. This isn't a blockbuster movie; there's no spectacle of special effects to dazzle, amaze, and distract you from the fact that the whole sequence is hollow. If there's no reason to invest emotionally in the fight, then it's not going to read well regardless of how well executed it is as a piece of action. A lot of people criticise JKR for always putting character and plot before the "logic" of action sequences but she was absolutely right to do so (though ideally you would have all 3).

2. Use of the setting. A fight should occur in a place and the features of that place should be relevant to what is occurring. An action sequence is not a boxing match occurring in an empty ring.

3. Stemming from both 1 and 2: action should be *goal-oriented*. The DOM fight in OotP is the perfect example of this: each side is after the Prophecy and that gives dynamism to the scene - it's as much a chase sequence as a fight sequence. It also gives scenes a greater scene of strategic reality: people enter into fights for /reasons/, and those reasons should continue to have prominence in the narrative during the fight. 99% of fight scenes in fanfic break this rule - see the endless random attacks Voldemort executes on Hogsmeade/Diagon Alley which serve no strategic purpose other than killing time with a vague sense of threat until Harry is ready to defeat him.

4. Set up your setting first, as much as you can. You don't want to be describing scenery extensively during the action, so it's best to lay the groundwork earlier in the story. Again, JKR did this well for the Ministry in OotP.

5. Keep it Harry Potter. There is a tendency in the fandom to think of wands as guns and treat a magical fight as if it were a Muggle fight. This typically robs an action sequence of the typical HP feeling. Some specific things to mention: (i) maintain spell variety, and if you think it wouldn't be logical for characters to use a variety of spells, then there's something wrong with your magic system; (ii) maintain the sense in which a magical fight is a contest of minds more than a contest of bodies; participants are matching their knowledge of magic against their opponent, not their ability to perform acrobatics, and absent extrinsic factors, the person who would do better in their DADA OWL is the person who will win the fight; (iii) keep Muggle artefacts out of it; (iv) respect the magical hierarchy e.g. Dumbledore and Voldemort being able to casually throw around crowds of opponents.

** It has to be creative and have a good deal of variety imo. Not just spamming Stupefy all over the place. The DOM battle is a good blueprint I think

** I like fights that feel like fights - tunnel vision, fog of war, hastily cast spells, lots of movement and using the terrain. I don't like fights where complicated, "clever" spells/combos are used as if it were an exhibition. I don't like fights that seem more like a series of duels instead of a battle.
