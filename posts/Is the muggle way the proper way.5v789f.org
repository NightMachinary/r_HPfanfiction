** Yeah that's pretty dumb. I'm outspoken about the stupidity of wizards and wouldn't stand for most of their social and cultural norms, but it should be obvious that lots of things just work better with magic.

Sounds the same to me as anti-tech people, who insist on doing things the hard way just because of some kind of superstition that this will affect the finished product.

If there is some qualitative difference between muggle and magical cooking there's of course a reason to do it the muggle way, but if you insist on wasting your time just because then it's just regressive.

** I sense two fundamentally different mindsets between Magical and Muggle worlds:

Magical world, at least the pureblood segment, was zealous about keeping tradition and maintaining their own way of life. Because of magic, there was no real material scarcity. Healthcare was relatively cheap and painless. Personal comfort level was high. They saw their society as perfect and superior to Muggles, and they relished their self-imposed segregation. Even Muggle friends like Arthur Weasley viewed Muggle world only as some kind of curiosity. So to speak, there was a strong sense of complacency among Magicals.

Muggle world, ever since the Industrial Revolution, has been bent on progress. Traditions are discarded in favor of 'change', efficiency, and productivity. Tech visionaries such as Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Larry Page, Mark Zuckerberg, and Steve Jobs are being worshipped, while reactionaries like Donald Trump are being spit upon. Just take a look at [[/r/Futurology]] and you will have some idea of the crazy stuffs that are being worked on. Muggle world is constantly facing material scarcity, resource shortages, and threats from all kinds of disasters. As a result, Muggles are in a persistent crisis mode.

How this situation would develop in future would be great fanfic material.

**** Mostly in terms of energy policy.

Coal has no future, except for certain regions within the US. The most he can do is to slow down the decline and give coal producing regions more time to adjust.

Bringing coal jobs back is even more ludicrous. In 1950, there were 1 million workers in the US coal industry producing 500 million tons a year. In 2010, the all time peak of US coal consumption, 86000 workers produced 1 billion tons of coal. Automation, not reduction in consumption, has killed coal industry jobs.

** I think that there are two kinds of writers. Muggles, and wannabe pure bloods. And what everyone wants to know deep down, is who would win in a fight. The cultures of both countries are very different. But I think I can answer some of the differences in the Wizarding Culture.

For one thing, change and innovation in the Wizarding World is bad. Very bad. Everyone in the Wizarding World is armed and dangerous, and there are multiple weapons which tread the border of a weapon of mass destruction. Fiendfyre comes to mind. A Basilisk and a Nundu as well. While not as powerful as traditional muggle weapons of mass destruction, they are infinitely easier to obtain. A Basilisk can be created with some dark magic, a toad, and a chicken egg. Fiendfyre can be tossed off at any time. Now take this in, and consider that you have a small insulur community, who has faced oppression from Muggles, and two civil wars, and what amounts to a world war. If any old creative spellcrafter can make up a new spell, then literally everyone can learn it.

It is actually somewhat similar to the problems that Muggles have with the internet. There are those who create computer viruses, and the knowledge of how to create them is transmitted, with no need to understanding(if you copy paste code), no need for materials, and no way for the government to really stop it. The difference being that unlike computers, defense against spells is not an all or nothing ordeal. You can shield, and it might work, or it might not, and you don't have the luxury of firewalls and good practice to prevent it. Think about the controversy with Stuxnet. An incredibly innovative, powerful weapon, which propagated incredibly fast, and caused real world effects. Now imagine a world, where this is the norm.

Now, the military differences in the world really are indicative of who and what they were fighting. The Muggle military utilizes armored vehicles, high speed projectile weaponry, and explosive devices. This is because they fight other muggles with much the same tactics and weapons available. They are used to fighting on large scale wars, and their weapons reflect that. The Wizarding World is adapted for fighting one on one, or in small groups. They don't typically bother with Transfiguration, because it can be canceled, rendering it useless. Instead, they used targeted beams which must be blocked, and cannot be canceled out of midair. Their small numbers prevent them from large massive armies. But on the flip side, they make for the perfect guerilla fighters. They can turn invisible, they can teleport, they can detect all human life in an area. They have an incredibly diverse assortment of highly effective, deadly weaponry, which can be used silently. They are able to instantly kill without fail, they can control minds, and they have nearly infallible interrogation techniques.

And in peacetime, they can be rather whimsical and carefree. They use magic for everything, so why not make a spell to specifically conjure slugs in someone's mouth. They have an entire industry focused around entertainment and mischief, and there is a dedicated Department, meant specifically to keep muggles safe from pranks. They do not innovate with dangerous heavy weaponry, but they do with regards to harmless inventions, little spells to brush teeth, tie shoes, and cook.

Magic in general is much more versatile than science and industry. This makes it win almost always in questions of quality. The only exceptions are in things that wizards aren't interested in, like guns, mechanical craftsmanship, and metallurgy. However, the power of industry wins out over magic. Yes, wizards can conjure simple items, but not magical ones. To make anything important, they have to enchant, rune carve and ward and item, with it being custom made. They are unable to switch to interchangeable parts, due to the nature of magic. In contrast, once R and D are done for muggle science and industry, they can make big ticket items, and then optimize them until they are mass produced and cheaper than dirt. For a hundred bucks, you can pick up a phone, with more computing power than the super computers used to send men to the moon. You are likely using one to read this comment. The issue with the two cultures, is that they are alien to each other. They have nothing in common except muggleborns. With the spacially hidden and expanded space, as well as teleportation of wizards, the geography has nothing in common. For all intents and purposes, Britain and the Wizarding World are two very different countries, with two very different cultures and good reasons for both. They have strengths and weaknesses, and that is fine.

Thousands of disgruntled Muggleborns and Half-Bloods served under his/her command, and tightly bound by magical contracts.

Then at the site of Quidditch World Cup, a nuclear device was being smuggled in and awaiting the Executive Order 66. When it finally arrived, the detonation instantly killed 20% of world's magical population, and imperiused Muggle leaders ordered its military to strike at all strategic magical sites simultaneously, with his/her wizard minions leading the way.

**** I think that did happen to an extent. Tom Riddle was notorious for use of the imperious curse, but he also entered the Wizarding World around the Second World War. He also hated everything Muggle, and magic was more superior to industry than it is today. If we were to put everything into Muggle terms, we could say that he handily compromised the government, quelled resistance, participated in a (not quite a genocide, more like disappearing people without state sponsorship). He radicalized the wealthy powerful elite and stirred up hatred against Muggleborns, who would have been seen as immigrants and refugees are seen today, most notably the perception that they destroy culture and want to change a society. He fought a successful guerilla war against the establishment, using terror tactics, most notably the Taboo, which terrified everyone into not saying his name, but also identified and located those who did, namely his enemies. He didn't round up all the Muggleborns and execute them, but rather he whittled down their numbers and marginalized them when he couldn't. I personally have no problem comparing Voldemort to dictators like Hitler and Pol Pot. After all, the severity of the crimes was similar, just not the scale.

Why do wizards 'lack logic' as Hermione fairly/unfairly pointed out?

The idea I lean towards is the fanon one where the elves live symbiotically with humans. Humans get their loyalty and domestic help, house elves get to share some of their masters magic.

However, that is a fanon idea, so doesn't count for or against Hermione's reasoning.

As far as she can tell, they literally are slaves that have been brainwashed into thinking the horrible way they are allowed to be treated is okay. (Not that it happens to all house elves, or all the time, but the way Mr. Malfoy treats Dobby in the Chamber of Secrets in front of Dumbledore and Harry shows mistreating house elves is not taboo at least)

She does over react, especially after she has talked to the house elves at Hogwarts and does not take into account what they want.

Granted, if you write into your fic that house elves are getting paid in magical life sustenance or something that actually justifies required slavery, it's less of an ethical issue, but from canon I don't think we can argue who is right (although certainly Hermione's crusade was treated like a big joke).

Absent any compelling canon reason to do this, I don't see any reason why a good author shouldn't just A) Ignore it, it was a weird thing for JK Rowling to include anyway or B) Actually treat Hermione's crusade as something more than a silly and pointless little endeavor. There's no reason to justify and then exploit it, but many, many authors do so.

Not if offered freedom by one who isn't actually capable of giving it. Hell if slaves talked about wanting freedom in the past, maybe a cruel master would punish them.

And another explanation for that is that

1) Hermione isn't capable of giving them freedom, because she isn't their master,

2) they don't want to appear to be disrespectful to their master and risk punishment by showing interest in freedom, so therefore

3) they tell everyone they love it, while secretly hating it, and avoid any appearance of wanting to be free, thus avoiding the Gryffindoor tower.

Also and again, "in their nature" was an argument used to justify actual slavery in real life. I like to drive, does that mean I should be forced to drive as a chauffeur for no wages?

************** Yes you're right she did. And after asking them, and they answered that they didn't want to be free. She decided that they were brainwashed. Pure arrogance! Just because someone disagree with her, Hermione claim that they are brainwashed.

Except that Hermione does have power over them, if she didn't why would they stop doing their job?

1) Hermione has power over them. That's why the house elves stopped comming to the Gryffindor tower. 2) a)Let's say that Hermione don't have any power over them, in this case the house elves, could take the clothes that Hermione hid without any consequences. But they still stopped comming so two choices: i) They felt so insulted that Hermione tried to trick them that they stopped coming ii) Hermione does have power, in this case it's a paradox. Reductio ad absurdum. Meaning that Hermione does have power. b) Hermione has power, then the house elves could either take the clothes and being free. But they didn't, meaning that they DON'T want to.

And except if you are a magical creature, famous for driving as chauffeur since the time of the founds for no wages, then fell free. If you are a human then do what you want.

***************** Lol: "I'm gonna be the bigger man. Nah nah nah, I'm not listening to you!"

Hermione is probably my most disliked protagonist. You're arguing against a position you believe I have and have never answered any of my actual arguments. For one, house elves handle student clothes all the time (laundry and stuff), so we have no indication to believe anything except that Hermione is delusional with thinking her plan would work and that the house elves are probably avoiding it to avoid disrespecting their actual master.

It's literally racism. Technically species-ism. Enslave them because they're not human! We have no actual, canon support, that house elves nature is actually that of being slaves....just a series of biased hearsay, included accounts from the possibly brainwashed slaves.

But since you're not responding to me, I guess enjoy your power trip fantasy of having slaves? I honestly don't see why slavery of all things is so embraced by the fandom...

** Toothbrushing: Unless using toothbrush, wash, and floss is proven better than magic, I can't see any argument for it being the "proper" way. As someone who utter loathes the process of having to bursh my teeth, I would kill for a spell that would get it done quick. I can't see why anyone would prefer to do it the Muggle way if there's a spell that can do it instead.

Cooking: Either/Or. Doesn't Molly still still do it with stoves and cauldrons and it's just stirring/chopping/other prep work that's done by magic? In that case, it wouldn't make much difference. Someone who enjoys the process, or someone whose animation spells aren't very good, might do it the Muggle way, but most of them probably do it magically just for simplicity or out of laziness.

Gardening is a bit different. I don't remember if it's covered in the books, but some spells might interact with certain plants, especially magical ones. Alternatively, when it comes to magical plants, it may be that some of them /have/ to be dealt with by magic. So the "proper" way would really vary from plant to plant. But chances are there's a simple spell for pulling up your average weed, in which case I'd say magic is the proper way unless a person actually enjoyed digging up weeds.

Hermione, or other muggle born, on the other hand who came from a place of moderate affluence may have received the talk about how making a job easy lessens the value of doing the job and that hard work makes you value the results more. So them I could see with this position.

*** Fandom's rather split on whether casting spells takes effort, but people seem to use magic for a variety of routine tasks. For instance, Remus Lupin conjures flame to see better on the Hogwarts Express instead of carrying a flashlight. Tom the bartender uses magic to light a fireplace instead of a tinderbox. So it probably wouldn't take /that/ much effort to clean your teeth with magic.
