What, I believe, was Lucas' greatest triumph was translating those tropes into modern language (by the standards of the 70s and 80s). He modernized them by adding beautiful space ships, droids, aliens etc. That's his true skill. Cultural translation.

Is the idea of a chicken more complex than a drug?

Probably yes.

Transfiguration in JKR's world, doesn't follow any logic. Gamp Laws make it so that food, sustenance, can't be created from non-food. Probably true for drugs, which affect the body in a similar, if different, manner as well.

If it has the same properties as iron why don't other transfigured things? You can transfigure items into chickens. If you transfigure snow into iron, why can't transfigured chickens be just chickens, at least for the time of the transfiguration, why couldn't it lay eggs, it has all the parts, doesn't it'?

************* As you say, it's magic, but one could explore the nuances if one feels like digging deeper.

Snow -> Iron behaves as much like iron as the caster understands the properties of iron and is able to impart that magically onto the snow. Could you use that iron in a chemical reaction? Not unless the caster factored that into their transfiguration... but if you did, then you start getting into alchemy.

Transfiguration, in my opinion, and what [[/u/Von_Usedom]] seems to be going for, is not a complete alteration of the physical properties of the object(s) being transfigured. To the limit of the one performing the spell (power put into the spell, knowledge of the end-result, concentration of the caster, etc), the transfiguration will behave as intended until something happens to the object that disrupts that transfiguration beyond caster's knowledge or intention or is magically possibly.

#+begin_quote
  There are a number of factors a wizard must take into account when carrying out Transfiguration spells. The intended transformation (t) is directly influenced by body weight (a), viciousness (v), wand power (w), concentration (c) and a fifth unknown variable (Z)

#+end_quote

So, you want to transfigure a chicken, but in order to slaughter it and eat it, you are embarking on a property of the chicken which is far more complex than simply creating the /illusion/ of a chicken. The caster knows enough about a chicken to make it look and behave or even smell like a chicken to his own senses and up to the point where his knowledge of chickens ends: which is invariably an incomplete picture of a whole chicken.

A transfiguration is not a complete transformation unless the caster has factored all the molecular interactions. At least, not in my headcanon (as stated above, complete transfiguration is alchemy). Turning a matchstick into a needle is easier by comparison because the properties of each are relatively simple. One must know that a matchstick is mostly wood and the needle is mostly metal, magic takes care of the rest. If you were to try to melt the needle down, though, you might end up with melted metal, but you might also end up with the needle catching fire like a matchstick because you didn't account for that possibility in your spellcasting.

A chicken, though, is complicated. It's billions of years evolution at play. It's flesh and bone and blood and feather and brain. It might be /possible/, but one would have to know all the interacting parts of how chickens work in order to transfigure one to the point where it no longer fails after that breaking point. You have to know, and be able to perform the transfiguration for, every nuance that goes into turning a live animal into food. Turning your desk into a pig is good enough for 11-year-olds.

To put it more simply, I believe transfiguring a cushion into a chicken will have all the nutritional value of a cushion, while appearing to be a chicken to the limits of the caster.

Depending on how their 'coffee culture' has advanced betwixt the Statute and the present, it might be even worse than that! See, once upon a time, coffee was /hugely/ popular in Britain. It was the drink of scholars, politicians, natural philosophers, all sorts of intelligence minded folks - they would gather at coffeehouses to debate and discuss. But coffee was taxed similar to alcohol - by the gallon - so the coffeehouse would make it up in advance, in great quantities, and then when someone ordered a "dish" of coffee it would be reheated and served.

So, picture something like gas station coffee that was cheap beans to start with, over roasted, over brewed, left to get cold and then reheated. Instant actually seems preferable at that point...

Anyway, I would highly recommend "A History of the World In Six Glasses," amazing book teaching popular beverages and the effect they had on civilization's development.
