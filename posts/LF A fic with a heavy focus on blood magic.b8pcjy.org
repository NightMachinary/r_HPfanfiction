I mean runic blood magic like A Second Chance at Life or something along those lines anyways. Where blood magic has a noticeable effect and isn't some subliminal, barely mentioned shit like in canon. Just curious if anyone has written anything similar with her concept of blood magic and such.


** Linkffn(Hermione Granger, Demonologist)

Hermione learns blood magic from demons and uses it casually for almost everything. Need to find Neville's toad? Blood magic. Getting bullied? Blood magic. Need a tutor? Summon a demon with blood magic.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.

#+begin_quote
  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** I'm not familiar with the fic you mentioned, but I'm writing a story that revolves around blood magic.

**** Sure! The main character acted on her discovery of the ancient dark witch Morrigan, releasing her early in the process, but failed to suppress the threat. Now MC is pursued, and she is pushed to her limits staying a step ahead while seeking a way to undo the witch's immortality and achieve her own goal at the same time (a goal I've only hinted at so far, I do wonder how obvious it is.)

I hope that clarifies a little!

  Bloody revenge is a tale old as humanity, an ever-spinning grindstone bound for another turn. Morrigan awaited hers for a thousand sleepless, deathless years, but she waits no longer. Pyrrha Clay is her mortal enemy, her liberator, and she flies from the reckoning with nothing left but what she carries; in her heart burns the same ruinous fire which fuels the cycle.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17911508][Evening's Freedom]] by Bridgette_Hayden. Lucius takes the magic in his blood very seriously. It's a one-shot, but it's a spinnoff of a greater story where no one really wants to talk about blood magic, but it's the core of Snape's magic ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15208766/chapters/35274458][Masterpiece - Severus]]), and his mother sacrificed prior babies, even her life, to make sure Snape had tremendous magic (not as grim as it sounds, they were magical abortions). (No runes are really mentioned.) A generation later, Harry doesn't realize he's inherited his magic from Snape, through magical bloodline. By the time Lucius gets involved, magical bloodlines have joined to create a new kind of person and a new kind of magic. The whole blood magic is still understated, but it's the cause behind all the plot twists. The whole tale is told through Draco's, Snape's, and Harry's viewpoints. The story is filled with other things, but it all stems from old magic running through the blood of new generations. Sorry if i've misunderstood and we're talking about two different ways of looking at blood magic.
