And no fics with Ron bashing, please; I've heard so much of that from other fic readers that now my automatic response is to defend Ron with my heart and soul, lol


** Beauxbaton: linkffn(12266465) features Harry in Beauxbaton after careful plotting by Dbby. This fic started as a cracking response to something here but sadly it hasn't been updated in a long time.

Drumstrang: linkffn(Harry Potter and the boy who lived by the santi)

Hufflepuff: linkffn(Harry the hufflepuff) and it's sequels are hilarious.

Slytherin: linkffn(Ruthless) is probably my best Slytherin Harry fic. It doesnt deal with the 11 year old politics that is common to this trope.

  What if in Book 2 Dobby worked smarter and not harder? Inspired by a reddit prompt. Many thanks to my beta ekb1circloud, who has also contributed a few passages of content as well, I believe that makes him a co-author. I read an entertaining guest review, that made me realize that I have to specify this is an AU.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278][Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run]], linkao3(7331278): Harry never went to Hogwarts, never met Hagrid, never learned that he is a wizard. The first time he hears about magic is from a bunch of mismatched teens trying to stop a war, while he just wants to get to work on time.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/285498][boy with a scar]] is a series of one-shots, each based around a different AU concept. of particular relevance are: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4330836][the heir of something or other]], where Harry is sorted into Slytherin, and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8158447][the last son]], where Ron is the 'Chosen One'.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin]], linkffn(11191235): One of the better Slytherin!Harry stories out there. It sets out to build and then subvert the cliches of the genre, and ymmv on how well it achieves this, but it is still a decent story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3559907/8/What-Would-Slytherin-Harry-Do][What would Slytherin Harry do?]], linkffn(3559907): A couple of snippets from Harry's time at Hogwarts, detailing how he would deal with the various obstacles he faced coming from a very different viewpoint. The last chap or two are odd, but it remains a solid read.
