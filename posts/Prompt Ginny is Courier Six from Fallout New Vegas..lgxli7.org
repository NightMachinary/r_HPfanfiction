*** First off: Why would it matter? The Courier has lost all knowledge of their past life. Heck, Sunny Smiles has to teach them to shoot! Magic is mostly book learning, and Ginny in this case has lost all book learning. All the Courier is able to tell Doc Mitchell is their name, nothing else. But let's say, to prevent any spontaneous bursts of magic, radiation does affect magic. It dampens it, since it messes with your genes. In my fic, I would have her wind back up in the HP Universe after the events of the game. The game takes place over the course of a year, so if she wound up there in book 6, she'd be 17 by the time of book 7. Teenagers are considered adults in Fallout anyway, so its not like it matters.
