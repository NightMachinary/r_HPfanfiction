I'm writing a Genius! Harry fic where he tries to design a broom that can fly faster than sound. I would like some ideas and feedback.


** the two big things that immediately stick out to me is altitude and protection, when youre flying that fast you're going to need to be much higher up than typical flights in order to minimise any obstacles in the way, things like pulling out of dives or turns are orders of magnitude more dangerous and difficult and you will need some kind of spell protection to stop the wizard in question being flattened/thrown off the broom by the compressed air. But in all honesty I dont see too many big roadbumps on the way to mach 1 and beyond

** My head canon on why brooms were chosen as flight instruments is that each bristle can be enchanted to produce thrust, so newer faster brooms have smaller bristles so they can fit more. Breaking the sound barrier would require a large amount of thrust so maybe his broom end up looking like a push broom instead of the more traditional design.

*** I always thought that the bristles played the same role as turbine blades in a turbofan jet engine. Each bristle compresses magically charged air and directs it into a tightly compressed stream.

**** The turbine blades in a turbofan actually recover energy from the exhaust air to keep the fan spinning. It's the fan part that compresses incoming air.

** Wizard would be thrown off the broom before reaching sound barrier and death from consequent fall is much more merciful than being skinned by shock wave of actually breaking sound barrier.

** This isn't really a difficult problem to solve all things considered. The two principle factors that he would need to solve would be decreasing drag and increasing thrust.

Thankfully broom flight doesn't require any lifting surfaces, so it would be fairly easy to produce a very low drag coefficient with the right shaped shield.

Also thankfully a broom and rider is far less massive than any plane, so even a modest increase in thrust would result in more speed compared to a plane. Whether of course the rider/enchantment/rune array can provide the power for that is up to speculation.

Honestly the only real limit I can see would be the reaction times of the rider. There is a reason why fighter pilots are a rare resource after all.

** A normal number of power runes isn't enough. More power runes aren't enough. So Harry develops a (more power) rune, but even a normal number of those barely reaches up to the sound barrier and doesn't break it. To break the sound barrier on a broom, you need more (more power) runes.

Yes, I do have an inflated opinion of my own sense of humor.
