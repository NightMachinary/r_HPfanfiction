The reverse of how 99% of stories seem to be. Any Weasley bashing immediately paints Fred and George as not in on it, on Harry's side against their own family, totally innocent, etc.

Also a lot of people seem to be like "The Marauders are bullies" but in the same fic "It's just a prank bro" whenever Fred/George do anything.

I don't hate them, I just hate both of those things, so I want to see something different for a change.

It might not be exactly what you're looking for, but the Twins especially horrid in this fic from the beginning along with the majority of the Weasleys considering this fic is from Percy's POV. It really bashes a lot of them until they have actual character growth later on.

*** I just tried to read that and it made me angry at how stupid everyone acted.

I quit once Percy with a terrible leg injury that is so bad he almost dies from it, gets up from his hospital bed and jumps out the window.

**** I know. That how I had felt when I first read this story. It is really ridiculous how dumb everyone looked in this story. I actually wanted to throw my phone on principal.

However, the psychological of this fic gets really interesting once you get further into the mind of the characters.

  COMPLETE. AU. Canon-inspired. Nearly eleven-year-old Percy's attempts to run away from home gets him far more than he'd ever bargained for. Encountering an Azkaban escapee, procuring an illness that brands him as dangerous by Ministry standards and being sorted into Slytherin, he tries to find his way back home again. DARK. Percy/Audrey endgame.

** It's not the main focus of the story, but linkffn(The Birthday Present by excessivelyperky) is pretty critical of Fred and George, mostly in a "they're careless and don't always consider the effects of their actions" type of way.

  COMPLETE. AU to HBP and DH. Snape and his apprentices form a bond which may never be broken, not even in death. And at the end of it, Severus Snape is able to perform a spell that he has never been able to do before. Ok, it's not a million words. I tried.

*** Thats the sort of thing i want. It's boring to see Fred and George as the "Hero Happyfunyay Pranksters" in every single fic, even in Weasley Bashing fics. I just want a change.
