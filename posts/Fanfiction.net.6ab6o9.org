Is fanfiction.net not sending emails when followed stories update?


** They were bugged for over a week, though I received a notification today, so they might now have been fixed.

**** I was getting alerts for authors and communities, but not stories, so I assume those were just not getting sent.

***** Ah, I didn't know that. The notifications for stories might still be broken, then - I received an author notification.
