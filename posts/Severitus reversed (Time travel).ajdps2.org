I like a lot Severitus fics and know there all kind oi time travel fics out there, and was curious about if there were fics with the roles reversed? With an older Harry traveling time backwards and mentoring a younger Snape.

Theres actually a bit of that in Delenda Est, though is doesnt seem to be something mayor:

linkffn(Delenda Est)

Can you recommend another fics like that?


** If you don't mind slash, linkao3(Escaping the Paradox) is pretty much that, though due to this trope + the relationship it does seem somewhat questionable. Still, it was a good read when I was going through time travel fics.

  When he looked back on it later, Severus realized how much worse his life could have gone. Those few short months in 6th year were much more important than he could have ever known at the time. It was hard to have perspective on something like that at 16; constantly dodging hexes and being ignored by Lily Evans. The Professor had known, though. That's why he'd come. (AU, SS/LE)
