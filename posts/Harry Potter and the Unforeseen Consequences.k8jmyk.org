After the war, Harry Potter decided that he has had enough of fighting. Instead of taking Shacklebolt's offer and becoming an Auror, he returns to Hogwarts, takes his NEWTs, and eventually joins the Department of Mysteries.

However, when an attempt at studying a mysterious crystal results in a resonance cascade and the DoM being overrun by alien creatures, young Unspeakable Potter must rely on his battle experience to make it out of there alive...
