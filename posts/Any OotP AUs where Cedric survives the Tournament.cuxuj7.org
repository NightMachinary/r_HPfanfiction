** The one that gets recommended most often where this occurs is linkffn(On the way to greatness), a Slytherin!Harry AU. He makes it to the end in linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School), an Ender's Game style AU, as well as in linkffn(Magical Relations), a Magical Dudley Dursley AU.

  Creeped out by all the tombstones, Harry and Cedric leave the graveyard almost as soon as they arrive. As result, much is different. Not sure of pairings.

** linkao3(Stay Alive For Now by nunchikoi)

I'm currently reading that, it's pretty good but it's a WIP (last update was this month) and I think it's still summer after 4th year there. Basically, Cedric somehow survives, witnesses some of Harry and Voldemort's duel and then decides to back him up on it, so they both are regarded as liars in Prophet. It's Harry/Cedric.

  Everything is the same except Cedric Diggory lives and thus, as God has decreed, Harry Potter has his bisexual awakening.Aka JK Rowling's Missed Opportunityâ„¢. Aka a celebration of 20gayteen.
