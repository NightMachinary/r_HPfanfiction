Any scenario that closely resembles that is acceptable, I guess.

thanks

  After the defeat of Voldmort didn't turn out quite like he envisioned, Harry stared into the Abyss preparing to prove something to himself, instead he tumbles into an experience he never expected, and he doesn't go alone.

  A Wee Dram of Tonks and Harry With a Splash of Football

which disappeared from FFN at some point this year. Perhaps someone still has a backup of that somewhere.

Other than that, there is one story where Andromeda stunned her daughter, did a switcheroo before the battle and died, but it kinda sucks and I wouldn't recommend reading it.

**** Thanks a lot for digging that up. You wouldn't believe how long I've searched for a backup (and the author hasn't written back after three months).
