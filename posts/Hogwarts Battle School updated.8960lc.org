** Never saw that ending coming (though it probably doesn't help that there are months between each chapter lol) and it is a good thing we only have to wait about 11 more days for the next chapter.

Kwan Li is one of the few authors I can trust with long hiatuses.

** [Chapter spoilers] I'm reminded of [[http://bladekindeyewear.tumblr.com/post/9285161123/when-did-you-go-completely-mad][something I read]] a long time ago.

[[/spoiler][I just didn't realize it was going be so soon.]]

+(Help, how do I do spoiler text? The sidebar didn't provide insight.)+

*** All spoilers must use the spoiler tag: [Some spoiler](/ spoiler)

copied out of the sidebar

example: [[/spoiler][Things you shouldn't read]]

just delete the space between the slash(/) and the word spoiler.

  AU. Voldemort kills Dumbledore but is defeated by a child. In the aftermath, Snape becomes the Headmaster and radically changes Hogwarts. Harry Potter of House Slytherin begins his Third Year at Hogwarts Battle School and realizes that friend and foe are too similar for his liking. Competing with allies and enemies, Harry finds there is a cost to winning.
