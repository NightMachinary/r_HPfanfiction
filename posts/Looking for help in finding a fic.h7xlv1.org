Hello! I am very new at this so I'm sorry is this just sounds like random rambling. I have tried to sting to Ao3 for help finding this fic, but have gotten no results. Someone told me to try on here and see if anyone knew the work I was talking about.

I believe the work was a Lily/Severus fic where Severus went back in time after he died? He came back right before the “mudblood” incident, like literally just before he said the words, and he eventually got together with Lily. Years later when he and Lily have a son (maybe named Sebastian? I'm not sure), his mother is babysitting the son while Severus and Lily are out, when Voldie comes to kill the son (the prophecy is still a thing) and Sev's mother dies instead of Lily, making Sev and Lily's son the boy who lived, and Severus and Lily get to raise their son.

Some other details I remember was sev changing his appearance, sev throwing his father out of their house, and for some reason people selling trinkets to others proclaiming the trinkets to protect them, and lily and sev saying how ridiculous it was.

Any help would be much appreciated! I really loved the fic and wanted to read it again!
