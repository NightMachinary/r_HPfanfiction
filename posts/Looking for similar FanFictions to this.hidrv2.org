  Most people are happy to get reincarnated into the Harry Potter World. I'm not one of them. Being reborn a thousand years before the start of series in the Dark Ages is the worst thing that could happen to me. This is my story during these dark times, pardon the pun, and how I dealt with all the crazy things in my life. Warlock OC. Necromancer OC. Rational OC.
