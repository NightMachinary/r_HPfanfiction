I've been planning and mapping out a fic that is set in the marauders era but focuses on the more “background” characters in the order / death eaters. I have been scouring this sub for awhile and am just wondering if that's something that people are interested in at all. I know marauders era has been done to death but I'm really hoping to avoid certain cliches that I have noticed turn people off of the era. Background characters of course meaning the story won't focus on the core 4 boys and lily and their dynamic but that won't mean they aren't being written into it as well. Just trying to get a feel out to avoid certain cliches with the characters ( i.e. Emmeline Vance, the Prewett twins, etc )

So, if anyone wants to shout out the most annoying/over used “fanon” interpretations of certain characters that'd be super helpful!


** I think it's weird that the OOTP is the only front in war that's somewhat effective. If it's something you're interested, I think the background political intrigues between the ministry and the OOTP and other unaffiliated fighters or non-kosher intelligence gatherers like Aberforth and Mundungus Fletcher and the Unspeakables doing their own thing would be quite fun.

Regulus Black is always fun to explore, because he was just such a dramatic little shit in the message he left Voldemort, followed by sacrificing himself in the most Gryffindor way possible, and the transition from Mommy's little Death Eater to this couldn't just have Kreacher's mistreatment as the only catalyst.

*** Exactly! There's a whole plot with Regulus in my notes that definitely messes with canon slightly but still keeps it pretty on the nose and involves/explains certain others who don't get a lot of mentions in the books. It's definitely a darker vibe for sure, so it would lean heavily on the political/dark magic of it all. Having the ministry be so unable to take a stand and the tension between the OOTP and them is definitely something worth exploring that I hadn't thought of making a huge plot point but now would make sense considering some of the positions I have the characters in.

So far my main focuses are going to be Regulus, Emmeline Vance, the Prewett Twins, Alice and Frank, Dorcas Meadowes, Benjy Fenwick, Kingsley Shacklebolt, The Carrows, Mary MacDonald, Mundungus Fletcher and the Lestrange Brothers. Which sounds like a lot but their stories all sort of intertwine and connect in certain ways so it'll be interesting. I mainly just wanted to avoid the classic tropes and cliches that people were tired of seeing for each character and in doing so focus way less on the Marauders/Lily/Snape situations!

** I'd be interested in death eaters like Evan Rosier, Barty Crouch Jr, Avery Jr, Lestrange brothers, etc and their formative years in hogwarts
