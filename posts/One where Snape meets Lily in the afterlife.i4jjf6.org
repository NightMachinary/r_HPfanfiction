I just want a short, sweet, finished, well-done fanfic of Snape dying and waking up to his afterlife and Lily being there to greet him. Doesn't have to be a hook-up, more just want the redemption and resolve. Like Harry dying and seeing Dumbledore and talking to him.

I know one has to exist. I have no idea why I haven't been able to find it.


** Quoting myself verbatim, here: I'm not looking to start a Great Snape Debate, here, but I strongly feel that any fic in which Snape and Lily interact after he's spent years horribly mistreating the son for whom she gave her life needs to acknowledge how utterly contemptible and inexcusable that is.

Also, y'know, Snape played a major role in both Lily's and her husband's murders, so I can't really see either of them being too thankful to the petty, vindictive bully who got them both killed and abused their son, which he likely wouldn't've been able to do with impunity were they still alive.

** The ones I like go the opposite way, because Rowling's epilogue in Deathly Hallows is unsettling. Sure, there are parts of it that I like, I like the Harry/Ginny pairing for example, but most of it seems to whitewash problems not tie up loose ends.

linkffn(10980367) is the sort of afterlife "reunion" I envision for Snape. He deserves nothing better.

  The Committee of Judgement convenes to hear testimonies for the fate of Severus Tobias Snape. A one shot where the dead get to lay it all out there for Snape. Not something for Snape fans.

**** Thanks for sharing, but I am looking for the interpretation and fanfiction type that recognizes redemption and the nuanced character of Snape, like Harry Potter did in the last book when he named his son after him and called him, "The bravest man I ever knew."

***** But Snape never redeemed himself.

Oh he was on the right side, but that's it, he made no great sacrifice (he died not to accomplish anything, but because Voldemort thought a wand was loyal to him), he spent most of his adult life bullying children.

***** Yeah, I can tell. I suspect that you are having trouble finding it because most Snape fans tend to lean towards the "James must have used a love potion on Lily" which I do not think would satisfy. Most of the ones that do not, tend to go the same way I do. I responded mostly hoping that someone would see my sub thread and maybe provide more like it, even if it doesn't match the redemption arc you are looking for ;-)

** linkffn(3672509) This is short but sweet

linkffn(Nothing to Forgive by Tempest Kiro) This author is pretty great and this is a nice fic

linkffn(Forgiveness by dragonwriter24cmf) Ok this is one of my absolute faves it was really tear jerking but the mood of it was just so wonderfully done

linkffn(The Five People Snape Meets in Heaven by seriousblahblah) This is a bit more light-hearted but it's nice

linkao3(Fields of Summer by genericpseudonyms) Ah this one was damn angsty and really well done I loved this

There's another fic but I can't remember it for the life of me but it involves like Snape slowly repairing back his sky in the afterlife by meeting the marauders and lily and dumbledore and a detail like Sirius can travel anywhere because he fell through the veil but others can only appear in front of someone else when they are both thinking of each other. That one was a great afterlife fic too.

Hope this helps!

*** Thanks so much for taking the time to find these! After some of the other comments, I worried my search was doomed.

I just got in a terrible accident with a hornet's nest, and I'm stuck in rest mode for a little bit while everything heals. Something like 50 different stings. This will help distract me. Thanks again!

**** Oh no :((( I hope you recover soon !

I think the first link is not working but it's called Redemption and it's by author Reign and it's on ffnet

Happy to be of help! Honestly if you get too bored and you want some more of these fics the best bet is always to traverse through the ffnet and ao3 pages for sev/lily, it's like no matter how many times you look through it there's always something that you would have missed previously and it catches your eyes lmao. Hope you enjoy reading the fics! :D

  His past was bleeding into the present, just as his future was bleeding out of the gaping wound in his neck. And since memories were useless to a dead man, Snape plucked them out of his mind and gave them to The Boy Who Lived. He didn't realize that in so doing, he'd forget her.
