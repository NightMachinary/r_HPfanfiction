And they're just as ambitious, cunning and rich as him.


** aw man...there was a scene of this in one of the recent fics I've read. Malfoy Senior does the whole "The Malfoy family is pureblood and can trace back the 15th-16th century in England" etc. Justin's father laughs in his face. 15th Century? Is that all? The Fletchly part of Finch Fletchly can be traced to /least/ William the Conqueror (or somewhere around that). Currently digging though my history to find it, but no luck yet. :\

*** That sounds really familiar. Isn't it a fic where Harry gets abandoned in a mental care facility and meets Hermione there? And it sort of evolves into the muggleborns all meeting each other beforehand? Idk, I can't for the life of me remember the name either

**** YES! That sounds right! It also explains why I can't find it in my Ao3 History, since I'm pretty sure it was on ff.net. Wish they had a history thing.\\
Or maybe they do but I've never found it?\\
Edit: Got it!\\

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

** The idea of a "Parents Evening" for the parents of the new first year class being held in Hogsmeade had initially tickled Lucius Malfoy. Trust that meddling old goat to attempt to Muggleify the school even further . However he had learned most of his respectable pureblood comrades would be in attendance and reluctantly decided he and Narcissa should as well. They would just need to stay as far away from the Muggle scum as possible

Hogwarts had rented out The Three Broomsticks for the evening and had set up a clearing for the Muggle parents to arrive by Portkey . Lucius and Narcissa were sitting with their closest friends ; the Crabbes,Goyles,Parkinsons and Greengrasses. The men talked about Ministry business while the women gossiped about everyone who entered,having a wonderful laugh when Molly and Arthur Weasley entered in tattered dress robes and nearly ran into Matthew McMillan

Finally,the moment Lucius had been dreading arrived. The sounds of confused shouts and rapid questions could be heard outside as the Muggles began to trickle in. First were a couple with curly brown hair who introduced themselves to the crowd of wizarding parents as Drs.Herman and Ella Granger,a young woman (scandaously young to have an eleven year old son) who said she was Sammy Corner,a surly man in a workman's uniform who grunted that he was "Kevin's Da",a black couple wearing brightly coloured clothes who said they were the Thomases,an old Chinese woman who said she was the grandmother of Su Li,a couple with American accents who had raised Roger Malone and finally a middle aged couple dressed in impossibly fancy clothes who called themselves,Finch Fletchely

Professor Dumbledore clapped his hands as everyone(reluctantly in several cases) began to mingle . The Thomases made fast friends with Rachel Finnegan while Nancy Boot and Portia Goldstein awkwardly made conversation with the much younger mother of their sons friend.

Lucius reduced the urge to vomit when he saw that the Finch-Flethcelys were making a beeline for him and Narcissa with wide smiles."Hello,there Malfoy" greeted the woman Lucius would later learn to be called Sophia while her husband Nathaniel extended a hand to Narcissa who recoiled in fear.

"How do you know our names ?" demanded Lucius . "Justin tells us all about the mean blonde boy in his letters" said Nathaniel sickly sweet. "He tells us how Ernie and Hannah say how his father was a leader in the group that wanted to kill people like him"

"We would just like you to pass on a message to your son,Mr.Malfoy in case he tries to do anything to Justin or any other Muggleborn" drawled Sophia."Did you know Thaddeus McKiop ?" asked Nathaniel

McKiop had been a loyal Death Eater who reguarly abducted Muggleborn children from their beds and brought them to Bellatrix to do with as she pleased. He had vanished off the face of the earth two weeks before the Dark Lord's defeat."I'll take that as a yes"said Nathaniel grimly lowering his voice.

"When Justin was a baby,we woke up to the sound of him crying hysterically . We ran down the hall with one of our servants and found him in the arms of an ugly man in dark robes. Our servant is what you would call a Squib and immediately tackled the man to the ground allowing my wife to catch Justin . We took the man to the cellar and interrogated him with what our servant called Vertiserum"

"He told us everything,about the Wizarding World,about the likes of you and about Hogwarts. And then we made him disappear."

Narcissa make a noise like a dying cat while her husband turned ashen. The Finch-Flethcelys gave wide grins."Lovely talking to you two"chipped Sophia before she glided over to talk to Professor Sprout being followed her husband

The two Malfoys all but stampeded out of the pub and apparted back to their manor. The next night an attack force of twenty five Death Eaters descends on Ficnh Fletchely Manor

The morning after,Lucius Malfoy,Marcus Flint and twenty three other men from prominent Pureblood families were found tied up in Diagon Alley,stripped to only their underpants(revealing their Dark Marks) and with their magic bound from some unknown method

That same morning,Justin Finch Flethely received a cryptic letter from his father telling of the importance of having connections. Justin shrugged his shoulders before running off to go play with the other first years

This is a bit rough but I had fun
