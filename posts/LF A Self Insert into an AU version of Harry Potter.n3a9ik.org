So I am looking for (and can't seem to find) a self insert story that takes place in an AU version of Harry Potter. It can be anything like Neville being the BWL or Harry's Parents surviving or gender flipped characters or massive AUs. Can someone help me find a fic like this?


** Linkao3(Rose Petal Red) has this. Ignoring the massive AU worldbuilding elements (Dark/Light cores, Seer/Soothsayers, Slytherin Internal Structure), finding the actual canon divergence point (set in the 16th century) is a major sub-plot. The world itself is observed to be darker than canon.

Edit: There was also that fic where the SI discovers that he is in a Dresden Files/HP crossover. Don't remember the name.

  “What's best for me and mine, and what's fair for everyone else.” The father of my second life told me to keep those words close. Even back in my first one, I'd been a zero or one hundred kinda girl --- those words defined my life, this time around. Probably for the best, really. My father's name was Arthur Weasley, and I was born in a universe where the Boy Who Lived wasn't guaranteed to win. Looks like I had to pick up the slack, yeah?
