This one I think will be a bit of a stretch. I recall Harry (now referred to as OHarry) (maybe) defeating Voldemort and then finding out the real harry (Rharry) along with James and Lily still live. Rharry (who's a bit of a dick) takes over OHarry's life and OHarry then has to revert to who he was before. I think Albus is still alive. Sorry for the lack of information. Many thanks if you do find it!

*** Sorry it's not this one. Very close though! Thanks for trying. It did kick loose just one more thing that I recall it was a real baby that was switched with Rharry.
