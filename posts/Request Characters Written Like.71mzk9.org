So I really love how Northumbrian and Lomonaaren writes the characters and was wondering if any other author has the characters written like those authors do?

Any rating is fine, am fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash. If multi-chapter would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.


** I like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/763509/Annerb][Annerb]]'s characterizations very much.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12569750/1/pick-it-up-pick-it-all-up-and-start-again][pick it up, pick it all up and start again]], linkffn(6919395;12569750), are great Ginny fics.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/8941561/chapters/20467861][half awake and almost there]], linkao3(half awake and almost there), is one of the best non-magical AU out there.

  Wherein Harry never could help himself from trying to save the day, and Ginny was just trying to survive her shift without killing any of her customers.

  The thing about war is that it never ends. Not really. The battlefields just change locations. Harry and Ginny after the war. Sequel to The Changeling. First story in the Armistice Series. Harry/Ginny.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

** I've read a theory about Lomonaaren and Lightning on the Wave (author of Sacrifices Arc) being the same person. They have very similar style, themes, characters..

Now I don't really believe this is true, but I cannot argue with similarities in their fics. So I would suggest Saving Conor and its following stories. I don't really like it that much, but I don't like Lomonaarens works neither so.. :)
