I'm looking for a fic where Daphne come visit Harry at the Potters (Both James and Lily are alive and Harry has a brother) and leave with him because his twin and Ron bully him.


** I've not read that fic. Have you searched here? [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5smdn6/my_harrydaphne_recommendation_list/]]
