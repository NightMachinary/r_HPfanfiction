Does anyone have any stories that are about the Hogwarts Staff? Preferably about the Teachers, not the students. Maybe the relationship (Non-Romantically) between them as well as humorous?

I don't want the students to be the main characters or anything, but they can be minorly in there.

Thanks,

Aquarius

Oh, and there's this one as well. I will say the author knows libraries/librarians /very/ well. Desk Duty; linkffn(2091884)

  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.

  Remus's mind is usually a tidy place. The worst has already happened, what's left to be scared of? His fears are labelled, annotated, and most of all, archived. For one evening, though, he'll have to let them come out and play. (Remus prepares the Boggart for his lesson with the third years. Featuring Severus Snape as an unwanted critic, and Sirius Black as the elephant in the room.)

He had always considered himself ready to die, but when he considers the burdens he's leaving for those who remain, at the onset of the Second Wizarding War, he is faced with a dilemma.

  "The school greeted Minerva McGonagall's return with delight. Minerva threw herself into her work, proving herself a strict but inspirational teacher. If she kept letters from Dougal McGregor locked in a box under her bed, this was (she told herself firmly) better than keeping her wand locked there. Nevertheless, it was a shock to learn from the oblivious Isobel (in the middle of a chatty letter of local news) that Dougal had married the daughter of another farmer. Albus Dumbledore discovered Minerva in tears in her classroom late that evening, and she confessed the whole story to him. Albus Dumbledore offered both comfort and wisdom, and told Minerva some of his own family history, previously unknown to her. The confidences exchanged that night between two intensely private and reserved characters were to form the basis of a lasting mutual esteem and friendship." - Pottermore
