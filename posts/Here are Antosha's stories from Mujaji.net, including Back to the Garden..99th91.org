** A bit of background? Who's the author, what're the stories about? What's Mujaji net?

Is this even Harry Potter?

*** Yes, it's all Harry Potter. Mujaji was the website the author posted their stories to I guess. I don't know anything else but that because I only went there for a couple of this author's stories.

I haven't read all of the stories so I don't know what they're all about. I didn't make this post to recommend them, just so that if anyone wanted these stories they could have them since the site went down. Someone asked me to upload them.

**** Cool. I'd never heard of Mujaji, so was actually curious. Did it have a specific lean or was it just a generic story archive?

***** I really have no idea. I only used it to access this author's stories and the only story I really read was their novel length Back to the Garden.

*** She is known for writing the 'best' Harry/Ginny/Luna stories, I believe. Most of her novel length were written before or disregard DH.

I had always been under the impression that Antosha was a man... have I been wrong all this time?

***** Sounds like a Russian male name. Diminutive of Anton, I believe.
