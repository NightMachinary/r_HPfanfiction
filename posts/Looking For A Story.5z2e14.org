This was years ago, and I can only remember bits and pieces of it. Basically, Dumbledore has a son (or grandson) by the name of Kevin or Brian. Harry becomes physically strong (think of a body builder), while DD descendent teaches him and his friends powerful magic. I think I read it on MuggleNet but I have been able to find it since. Anything will help. Thanks!
