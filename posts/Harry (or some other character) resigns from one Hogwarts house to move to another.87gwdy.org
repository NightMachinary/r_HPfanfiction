I was just looking at another classic story that had 'Slytherins bully the muggleborn in their midst' in it and I got to wondering, what if said muggleborn in response to that (or dark-family pureblood in Gryffindor, or Luna in Ravenclaw, or I dunno) up and went and joined another house instead? Like, they called out their old house on their idiocy and went to another table in front of the whole Great Hall, started attending lessons with a different house, moving to their common room, et-cetera?

Does anyone know any fics where that happens?

  AU. The Sorting Hat doesn't just let the Sword go when it falls on Harry's head in the Chamber, but also Sorts him again, this time into Slytherin. Harry is furious and terrified, and the adults aren't helping much.

** Faith by Dragongirl16 has Harry kicked out of Gryffindor, and Neville and Ginny request a resorting in response. *Warning* for extreme violence and gore. Also Gryffindor-bashing, especially the Weasleys (including the twins, but not Bill and Charlie). Oh, and there's slash, too.
