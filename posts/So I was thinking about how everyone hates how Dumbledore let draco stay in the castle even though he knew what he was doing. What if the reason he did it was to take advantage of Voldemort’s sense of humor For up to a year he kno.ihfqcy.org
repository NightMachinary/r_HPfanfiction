#+TITLE: So I was thinking about how everyone hates how Dumbledore let draco stay in the castle even though he knew what he was doing. What if the reason he did it was to take advantage of Voldemort’s sense of humor? For up to a year he knows who is plotting.

While something might have happened on the side, I feel like Voldemort wouldn't take action until draco failed. Draco isn't some super competent assassin or anything after all.


** That might be justified if someone was keeping a close eye on Malfoy to mitigate collateral damage. And while that is what Snape tried to do, he didn't accomplish much.

*** Yeah pretty much this - Snape was /supposed/ to stop any of Draco's plots from working out, didn't work so well. But Dumbledore knew that:

1. as soon as Draco failed, Snape would have to fulfill his Unbreqkable Vow to kill Dumbledore, and Dumbledore has to make sure that Harry was fully informed about the Horcruxes before that could happen

2. If Dumbledore threw Draco out, Voldemort would just kill him

Canonically, we know that Draco was given this mission as a sick way of punishing Lucius for his fuck ups.

** I don't think so. Draco was working to make Death Eater in Hogwarts, and he successfully did that.
