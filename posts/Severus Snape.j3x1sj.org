Give the biggest rant you have in you about why Snape sucks and why you hate him.


** I hate Snape for being a piece of shit, but I also respect him for his resiliency in the face of what he had to do:

Snape is an undoubtedly brave and shit man (and very complex). After Snape turns, he has to suffer spying on Voldemort, staring the embodiment of evil in the eyes while defending himself from legilimency. He has to serve the man he absolutely hates for killing his love and has to kill the one man who has a half-decent relationship with him. He's absolutely fucking brave. If one man deserved to have a child named after him for bravery, it's Severus Snape.

Snape is also a piece of shit. The man didn't become a death eater for "social reasons". He joined because he was an angry man, seeking to strike back against perceived slights and an absolute racist. From a young age he excelled in the Dark Arts, creating sectumsempra. As a child, he stared "creepily" at Lily. He hung out with future death eaters and let's not even forget that Snape was the one who threw the first insult at James. Let's not forget that Snape was a blatant racist at Hogwarts who hated on every mudblood except Lily. This was not "seeking protection in Slytherin", the man joined a group with views that agreed with him. The man became a high ranking death eater, top-tier killing material. He was in a good-enough standing with Voldemort, god knows what he did to get it, that he could ask Voldemort /a favor/. The man gave up a prophecy knowing a baby was probably going to die without a second's thought. He arrived at Hogwarts knowing more curses than 7th years, the man was spiteful. Plenty of Slytherins did not become death eaters.

Even his redeeming quality, doing things for love, is not so redeeming. Even with his love for Lily, he wouldn't listen to her pleas to stop hanging out with future death eaters. He loves a woman who never loved him back, forming an obsession since his childhood. He hates on her son and Neville because they both contribute to why she's dead. He called her a Mudblood. I don't know about you, but as a non-racist person, when I'm in an argument with my friends (and I don't even think I'm in love with them), I don't call them racial slurs. He bullied children, but at least had the decency to grade fairly (Hermione did better than Malfoy). But I cannot deny that he did incredibly brave things to honor the closest he could ever get to love. It just wasn't a healthy love, it was an obsession. This was not a positive relationship.

Snape was a horrid man who did incredibly brave things for the wrong reasons. He absolutely deserved his traitor's death which allowed him to redeem himself. He's an incredibly complex character with incredible nuance.

I didn't even like this fic, but during an internet outage with nothing to do, I had to make to make do with what was already downloaded.

This quote here pointed out a plot fail that is glaringly obvious now that it is pointed out...

#+begin_quote
  "Then do tell me why it has reached my ears that you are the worse potions teacher in recent history?" Voldemort drawled, his voice dared Snape to try and interrupt and make excuses but Snape was smart enough to realise that it would simply get him more punishments. "It sounds to me like you do not know the meaning of the word subtle, I would like to think that my death eater spy would have the sense to not act like a death eater spy. While I have no sympathy for mudbloods and blood traitors, it is your job to pretend as if they matter. Yet it is widely known that you do not act like they do.

  While I understand your dislike for them, it is your job to act as if you do like them, yet you do not. Barty." Voldemort called.

  "Yes my lord?" Barty Crouch junior looked up from his kneeling position.

  "Remove your mask." Voldemort said in a soft voice and Barty instantly obeyed, removing his mask to reveal his thin face and straw coloured hair. "Young Barty here was able to fool Dumbledore and an entire school for a whole year," Voldemort said to Snape. "he tolerated the mudbloods and blood traitors for me, he held back his emotions and desires for me. You, Severus have not, why is it someone so younger and less experienced than you is able to do this and not you?" Voldemort asked, waiting for an explanation.
#+end_quote

See, this glaringly points out that Snape is spying ON Dumbledore FOR Voldemort. But in canon he acts like he is spying ON Voldemort FOR Dumbledore. JKR mixed up who Snape was supposed to be ingratiating himself with. But I blame that on piling too many tropes on a character.

*** One if the reasons why I say he is this Mary Sue aura of twisting other characters' behavior and character around to make him important.

Voldemort as described should have killed him or at least not trust him at all

*** When Voldemort falls, he's supposed to be acting the "bitter Death Eater who lost his Master and the only way to stay out of Azkaban is work under Dumbledore". He's not supposed to even /suspect/ that Voldemort might possibly come back. It would make no sense to integrate himself with those at the school in preperation for when Voldemort returns; he's not supposed to know that he /will/.

On the same note, changing his attitude when Voldemort /does/ come back, even gradually, would be far too much of a giveaway. He's managed to pull off "trustworthy arsehole who's biased towards Slytherin" so far, there's no reason to change it.

  So many fans are quick to point out Dumbledore's flaws but almost completely whitewash Snape just because of 'Always'.
#+end_quote

Really? While (unlike you) I'm semi-sympathetic to him (specifically the younger version of him, before he joined the Death Eaters or before he turned to bullying students as a teacher), I always regarded this scene as a negative towards his character. It heavily implies that Snape never cared for Harry after all, but was only annoyed that he had to die because he was the last part remaining of Lily. Which is a major character flaw, not a virtue...

** I don't want to rant about him anymore, but it is still there and it wants to burst out, even if I know that it's meaningless.

I don't like the character, never did, and probably never will. There are just a few things I don't like about him and a lot of them don't really have to do with him directly. Sure his actions are shitty for a huge part, but he is a fictional character. So it doesn't matter as much what he does, it is how people talk about him, that I have a problem with. My two problems with him are literally and culturally.

Literally, I don't think he is a good character, or more specifically a well-written one. People say he is complex and realistic, but he isn't. His motivations are contrary to his actions and his abilities don't make sense considering his character. Like we see him again and again being emotional, blowing up at students, taking pleasure in intimating them, he is petty and can't hide it and then we hear that he is this master of controlling his very thoughts and emotions... No. He is not, we saw it all the time in the books. And then we hear he is this super spy, but we always saw how little people skills he has, he doesn't even understand the fundamental morals of his best friend, but now he is this spy who can play anyone... And he has this Mary Sue characteristic that narrative and behavior of other characters have to twist around this story where he is important. Voldemort and Dumbledore are both said to be very intelligent, but they both have to act dumb like a piece of toast regarding him. Dumbledore tells nobody anything, but the one person he does is Snape, the spy, who is literally the one person most at risk to be caught. And again he is a spy, and even in the Art of War, the chapter about spies say that you never ever tell them more than they need to know about anything... And I wouldn't even start about Voldemort...

In the end, Snape is not a real character for me, he is a walking/talking plot twist covered in a thick layer of edginess to hide those cracks.

And culturally, I hate how people romanticize him. How they act like he is good and redeemed and how there is anything romantic about his feeling for Lily. Most people that ship problematic or toxic ships are well aware of it. But I don't see that with people shipping Snape with Lily. And the thing is, our media is on one hand an expression of our culture, but it is a way of creating and teaching culture as well, so by repeating this toxic picture of Snape as something good, this toxic behavior and culture are propagated as well. And that is when I think it gets dangerous in the real world, because we don't think about it and risk teaching young people that toxic relationships and friendships are not that.

So yeah, that is my rant about how people portray Snape
