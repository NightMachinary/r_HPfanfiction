[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/aspects-hp-twig-worm-pact-au.724264/reader][Aspects]], a quadruple crossover between Harry Potter, Worm, Pact, and Twig, has updated. Familiarity with the other series is helpful, but not necessary (I only got a few chapters into Pact and haven't read Twig at all).

My pitch: The protagonists of each series are reincarnated as first-year in Wizarding Britain. But their nemeses followed, and the Wizarding World isn't ready for these new magical threats. The character's voices feel very distinct, so you can usually tell who's talking without even reading the chapter headings. It's a slow burn so far, but I'm very much enjoying this story. Harry isn't really a part of the group, but his chapters provide a very nice look into what's going on in the adult wizarding world.

Cursory knowledge of each series is preferable, but so far it's mostly been Harry Potter and Pact setting elements that are relevant (and the story explains them as they become relevant).

*Pact* is the only other magical world, but the Thorburn's magic is very different from the Wizarding World's. Everything has a price, and even the most basic of magic requires convincing the Spirits that govern magic to work with you. Acquiring the ability to use magic and becoming a Practitioner makes you a little bit less human and more Other. You lose the ability to lie freely, because everything you do is of greater consequence to the Spirits. In general, it's a much softer magic system than Harry Potter, and things like symbolism or sympathetic connections have tangible magical effects. The Thorburns are in deep, deep magical debt because their ancestors summoned demons.

*Twig* is an alternate history that's very biopunk in theme. Sylvester was treated with a drug cocktail that accelerated his rate of learning, intelligence, and capacity for social manipulation, but at the cost of his long term memory.

Spoilers for Worm follow:

*Worm* is a logical reconstruction of superhero tropes---there are revolving door prisons, and major characters don't tend to die during fights, but there are actual in-universe reasons for this. Powers actually come from a symbiosis with multidimensional alien entities, or Shards, and these Shards manipulate their users and communicate between themselves to ensure that the most useful hosts don't kill each other. Towards the end of the series, Taylor Hebert underwent brain surgery that blurred the line between her mind and her power's, so she's not too keen on trying to recover her old powers.


** I don't agree that the character's voices feel very distinct, but it's an attempt at improvement by the author.

Your description is quite complete. I know don't what I feel about the fic though. It has a more canon Taylor Hebert than the other ongoing HP/Worm crosses, which I think is good, but it feels a bit bleak and switches between perspectives in a way that makes it hard to 'get to know' the characters.

I suspect that sticking to one perspective is good for characterization.

It's a bit at a crossroads where it's not easy to see what will happen. There's no clear path forward at all. I imagine that the author has some kind of plan though.
