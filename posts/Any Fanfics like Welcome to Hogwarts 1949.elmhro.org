I was interested in knowing if anyone knew of anything similar. I liked the idea that Harry went back, met Tom, and helped with the understanding that it would not affect his time. While others in his time react to the changes. Like the newspapers Draco finds that show Harry with Tom and Draco's grandfather.

  You always get the stories where Harry goes back into Tom Riddle's time, then either stays or gets sent back. End of, unless he tries to make Voldemort good. But what if things went differently? What if, just once, someone followed a time traveller back?
