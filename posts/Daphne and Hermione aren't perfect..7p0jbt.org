Recently I've read a few fics that have that second main character perfect, with few to no flaws. Really it seems they're the focus of these stories even though Harry is the main character. It's bothersome. Give me some interesting characters please, and thank you.


** Growing Up Black linkffn(6518287) fits the bill nicely, pre Harry/Daphne, but Daphne isn't perfect, she avoids interaction with others, overreacts a bit occasionally, and hates muggles. Now, some might not count that last one, especially as tons of people in that fic hate muggles- but as a muggle I must object.

Also it's Ron/Hermione/Dumbledore bashfest, so of course Hermione isn't perfect in it. Though at least all characters in it have flaws- even the arguably nicest character in the actual fanfic itself- the couple that adopted Harry, didn't do it entirely selfishly.

Really, the characters are what make the fic- they feel like actual people.

***** Only Ron and Dumbledore, and very light Molly bashing are in it if I remember right.

In Rons case, he's at least trying to do the right thing since he genuinely seems to believe Harry's evil- and for decent reasons.

Dumbledore... Eh, seems like a tired old man, manipulative as fuck, but he is on the side of angels, even decides, upon seeing how happy he is, not to try to take him away from who he believes to be an evil family.

Molly... Eh, she forbids the twins to talk to Harry, but then again, that's largely because she's worried he's a bad influence on them. She comes off looking the worst of the bashing victims even though we see and hear of her the least.

** Linkffn(Good Days and Bad Days by swiggy3000) is a pretty alright on-going fic which has Daphne suffering from a combination of depression/social anxiety.

It -does- get a little tiresome to read at times, but it is one of the better depictions of mental health issues and its effects on people I've seen in fanfiction so far.

*** It's one of those fics that are not the best, the plot is not that original, the writing is just okay... but they depict something extremely well (mental health issues, racism, or even sometimes coming out) and that makes up for it. I don't like the way the story portrays pureblood culture for example, but I still appreciate it for how real the depression is portrayed.

** The Wizard of the Kaleidoscope: linkffn(6995114) .

Harry Potter with a bit of Fate/Stay Night and Naruto. One of the best fics I've ever read and has some amazing characterizations. Hermione and Daphne are his best friends. Eventually, the fic gets away from Lungs and he has to tie it up with a little hand-waving (minor minor handwaving).\\
Stations of canon are hit, but only in name as things are very different since Harry discovers his abilities.

Bit spoilery, but both Hermione and Daphne go a little bit insane dealing with forbidden magics. There's also some very morally questionable sexual behavior in the story (dont say i didnt warn you).

** linkffn(12125300). Just finished this, today actually and it was great. The story is still in progress though, just updated a week ago. Daphne and Hermione are secondary characters and are certainly not perfect. You really just want someone to punch Hermione in the face and make her see reason or get over her faith in authority figures in a few scenes. She is definitely not the good know it all from canon, but still her character is pretty much the same, just that Harry isn't as dumb.

**** Yup, that's right. I had over a dozen readers who laughed about the fact that they accidentally read my fic as "Dermatologist", and after a Reddit thread said, "OMG someone should write this!" I figured I may as well give it a shot myself. :) I wrote it pretty quickly, but I'm overall pretty happy with how it turned out. You'll find a little dedication in an author's note at the start of the fic. Now, here's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12614436/1/Hermione-Granger-Demonologist][Demonologist!]] Also, if the OP is still interested, might I also recommend my series "Perfectly Normal", starting with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11591125/1/The-Definition-of-Normal]["The Definition of Normal"]], which has a flawed (but not OOC/evil) Hermione as a prominent secondary character, and Daphne is also hanging around the friendship group.
