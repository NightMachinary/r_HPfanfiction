** For the life of me, I can't find the fic that matches all of what you're looking though I could've sworn I read a fic like this before but nothing is coming to mind.

Well in an effort to help, here are some HG/SS time travel fics that I know fit the various points you mentioned:

*Thirty-One Days* - Snape the student has a secret lab that he takes Hermione to but she doesn't live in the room.

[[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=19456][*In Time*]] - Hermione has to wait for her time-turner to cool to use it again and in the meantime, she takes a job as the DADA professor. She also moves through time (forward only) several times to get back to the present and she visits Snape during each jump.

Both *Fade to Grey* and *Time's Fool* have Hermione jumping around in Snape's timeline throughout different periods in his life. Time's Fool also mentions a secret lab.

  Hermione uses a Time Turner to go back and change Snape's past. But his future is her present and Time is a fickle thing. Not your average Time Turner fic I hope!

  In the midst of the Battle of Hogwarts Hermione is given the opportunity to help save Snape's life. Little did she know it would require visiting Hogwarts twenty years prior. She has thirty-one days to befriend the sullen Slytherin, and perhaps save his life. But, as always, things don't always go as planned. HG/SS, time-travel, EWE

  Unable to catch hold of anything in order to save herself, her mind clung to the one fact it knew to be unassailably true: something was terribly, terribly wrong.

**** Okay so while I was searching for the fic you were looking for, I ran into a fic that I started a while ago but stopped reading because it wasn't finished and I saw today that the fic has been completed. I believe this is the fic you're looking for!
