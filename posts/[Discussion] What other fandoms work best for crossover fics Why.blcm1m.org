Everybody likes a good crossover fic, which fandoms do you think work best in crossover? Marvel? Game of Thrones? Lord of the Rings? Alternatively, what fandoms would you like to see more crossovers with? Which fandoms do you think are overdone?


** Short and sweet but HP/Riordan's books (Percy Jackson etc) are interesting. The issue is that PJO has a rather young active fanbase and you have to hunt for the good fics.

The primary characters are around the same age and have gone through similar life experiences so it's cool to see how they interact with each other.

** Look, the best crossover settings are ones where you have several factors involved:

Connection friendliness; settings where crossing over doesn't present too many problems. Rwby is a good example here: seemingly homogenous language, culture, advanced tech and plenty of reasons your crossover protags has at their disposal to explain how they slid through the cracks as it were. In addition, the enemies have scaling threat levels attached to them where you can pick & choose which foes your protags face.

Easy for a character from virtually any setting to slip in, as it were.

Compare and contrast with Warhammer 40k, a setting where your protag's best guarantee of survival is to side with the Catholic Space Nazis, every single enemy is either OP or a master of manipulation, you expose your very soul to Hell every time you perform magic and everything's out to kill you, the vast majority of your new allies included.

I mean sure, if you can convincingly write a protags that's perfectly happy to sit in a trench and shoot at insects with a lasrifle for a decade or more, that's great. Protags like Harry Potter would probably top out at five minutes in terms of life expectancy in that world though.

Detailed settings, clear crossover points: Simply put, the more we know about how both sides of the cross work, the easier it is to integrate them. Also, periods where your protags can step into the crossover story without immediately dying is definitely a good idea.

Example: Familiar of Zero. Detailed setting, simple magic system, clear cut political and socio-economic trigger points. Easy , easy, easy.

Counter example: S.T.A.L.K.E.R. (the movie). Nebulous and surreal, actually writing something for that rather than the book or the game (of which I know of ONE crossover worth mentioning thanks to Theanna The White) is either and exercise in world-building, a waste of time or both.

Easily avoidable stations of canon: because nobody wants a rehash, having a story where you're able to just throw the script out of the window or just have your protags do something completely different while the plot happens elsewhere is key here. And it helps if said plot features clearly defined moments and places that can be entirely avoided by the protags without threatening to derail the whole storyline.

Example: Hogwarts. Bumming around the castle and having adventures while the plot happens to other people is easy; just avoid contact with the Golden Trio at all costs and you'll be okay for six out of the seven books.

Counter example: Star Wars: the clone wars. Bumming around a galaxy in the middle of a civil war without backup gets your protags ganked. Sticking to Jedi, Clones or the CIS for protection is the way to go to avoid messy dismemberment or being shot by a laser cannon.

Characters with loads of interactions with everything: the more we know about a person, the easier it is to figure out how they'd react to certain situations. Do I really need to explain why this is a good thing to have in a crossover character?

Example: Harry Dresden. The entire series is from his perspective. You can't get more into a character's head than that.

Counter example: Sherlock Holmes. Any Holmes. Jesus that man's hard to write.

And that's it folks.

** I don't want to see HP magic overpowered to the point where authors have to nerf it to create a challenge. Thus, I don't like the ASOIF world. Our own world sucks too because one person with a wand can take it over pretty quickly.

LOTR works because its magic is different and has power HP magic does not. One Ring is basically a Horcrux.

High powered Sci-fi universes such as Battlestar Galactica, Marvel, Mass Effect, Serenity, Star Gate, Star Wars, and Star Trek all work well as they have powers comparable or exceeding HP magic. Nevertheless, HP Magic is competitive and our characters can make a difference there.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7725354/1/][Gods Among Us]], linkffn(7725354), deserves special recommendation as it involves both Harry and Hermione, and changes canons in all affected universes.

As for what crossover could be interesting, Fallout is definitely one. The setting is post apocalyptic so the Wizards don't have to hide anymore and can be a very beneficial force. They do face formidable challenges as their magic may not work well on many of their new enemies (and monsters). Writers have lots of leeways here to develop their world and make necessary adjustments to the balance of power. Unfortunately, there is NOT a single finished crossover between HP and FO based on my knowledge.

*** I totally agree with you that there needs to be an even playing field when it comes to battles.

I suppose the reason I like ASOIF fics is because how an author explores the cultural intersections. I'm not a huge action person when it comes to fanfics, I'm one of those Chad's who likes political fics and ASOIF really lends to that. Marvel and LOTR tend to do the same. Honestly most fandoms have a misogynistic assholes so dick measuring contests tend to flow naturally.

** So this is my humble opinion, and almost certainly a biased one at that.

​

I think fandoms where magic or the fantastical exist already work best. Obviously my own bias includes Star Wars (like the you tube video about the death star design, Jedi are basically Space Wizards! ^_^). But whereas my fic has magic and the force as one and the same, just used different... a completely different and totally valid (and awesome) look is Tsu Doh Nimh's The Havoc Side of the Force ( [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8501689/1/The-Havoc-side-of-the-Force]] ) where his magic is completely different and is anathema to the Jedi.

​

Comics also have a basis in magic too. Marvel has Dr. Strange and co. DC has Zatanna, Dr. Fate, the greek gods etc. Image has Spawn and Darkness and such. Fantasy series such as LoTR and GoT work exceptionally well, though they can be a struggle to write in, at least in my head. ( At least LoTR, I don't actually know GoT. Not a fan of ASOIAF.

​

Places without magic per-se also work if Harry's trying to keep his magic a secret.

​

Places where Harry's form of magic doesn't work is also okay, if he has to learn to use something different. Or if his own magic has a unique interaction with that setting's magic. There was a Belgariad Crossover that had a ton of potential where Harry's magic worked but it drove everyone nuts so they trained him on his.

​

The only places I struggle to see it, are places where magic is so narrowly defined. Magic by it's nature is flexible and can fit in different arenas. A setting like D&D... probably wouldn't ever be one I wrote in since magic is so rigidly defined (by necessity) that it would be more about the mechanics than it would be about an actual story.

** Ideally you'd want a universe with a system of magic that's distinct from HP's, developed enough that you can discuss how the systems interact, but ambiguous enough that... well, you can discuss how the systems interact. Characters in the universe should either be compatible enough to make their reactions to Harry and vice versa entertaining or blank slates so that you can do the same.

Homestuck, the Nasuverse, Familiar of Zero, DMC, LotR, Madoka (and similar), Sentai, Code: Geass, most Disney films, comics, Avatar, TES, Riordenverse, Artemis Fowl, Buffy, Sabrina, etc.

Firefly/Serenity doesn't follow most of those rules, which is a great example of the fact that having a good writer is more important than having a compatible universe, as /Green Eyes, Brown Coat/ shows.

** LoTR can work extremely well, or extremely not. It really depends on how you approach it.

If you follow a lot of lore, and thus approach Tolkien's own great magic and inner power of Elves, dragons or things from the elder age you don't have to nerf Harry at all. Generally, I think a crossover works best if the power scales are somewhat comparable - but might operate on a very different scale.

Shadow of Angmar is one of the greatest crossovers I have read.linkffn(11115934)

Mass Effect and Warcraft can work. Surprisingly Twilight can be great, if it's not a horrifically bad shipping fic.

The Forks Massacre linkffn(9625517) is great, for example.

​

The one thing that I would REALLY want to read, is a solid, good HP/Disney crossover. Disney stories can easily be written as very mature, but it just doesn't happen. There was one(!) good frozen crossover, but I feel there's so much wasted potential. It could also help with the more whimsical tone of canon HP, instead of the grimmer tone many authors chase.

Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed.

** If I am being forced to give my opinion, the best crossovers right now are your Marvel/HP crossovers. This is mainly due to the attention that the MCU has given the fandoms.

The inheritance Cycle should translate beautifully towards Harry Potter, as long as the Ancient Language (the magic system of the series) is able to interact with HP Magic.

There are others as well; Mentioned by Kathrynd Star Wars has some wonderful additions to the fandom, one I am currently reading is linkffn(12497548). Now there is an issue with crossing over with Star Wars, Star Trek, battle star galactica, stargate, etc. That issue is the emphasis on technical advancement, which if we are staying true to canon HP, poses a major issue as any tech going into Hogwarts shouldn't be working, at least effectively.

There are a few fandoms I do not allow myself to read if they are crossed over with Harry Potter. The most obvious is Dragonball Z/ One Punchman/ etc where the emphasis is close combat that eventually grows to planet busting levels. This form of combat does not suit the Harry Potter Meta where conflict is rarely ever solved by power, but by knowledge of how to get the most bang for your buck. The other fandom I avoid is Naruto. This is primarily for the reason that Kakashi from Part 1 of Naruto should be more than enough to handle even Albus Dumbledore, due to how radically different the combat ideals are. In Harry Potter one of the most terrible things you can do is kill, torture or control others. In Naruto there is an entire branch of the damn military that does all of those. Not a good crossover.

One that I would like to see but havent seen done well at all would be an Avatar the Last AirBender cross over. The outputs of energy would be similar, with a good wizard being on par with most masters of each of the bending arts, at least in combative potential. Fire is still a very strong thing to fight against, and a wizard would be unable to shield forever. Apparation would be broken, but then again, that can easily be fixed in a decent fic.

Wanna take it very seriously ? You can. Want a joke world ? There are murder hobos, the "heroes" are retards that often cause the problems they must then solve (by killing things until it is solved) and the planet face annihilation every two years.

** Crossovers I've enjoyed:

Linkffn(Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider)

Well, canon Bill already raids tombs in Egypt. Adding in Petunia as badass squib archeologist works quite well.

Linkffn(Raptor by sakurademonalchemist)

Instead of Norbert, Hagrid's egg contains a velociraptor who got stolen from Isla Nublar. Jurassic Park works really well since it's also happening around 1993.

Linkffn(The Lightsaber)

Harry uses magic to make a lightsaber and learns to use the Force. Crossover with Star Wars without any actual characters or locations, just people trying to imitate it.

Linkffn(The Very Best by BrilliantLady)

Harry creates Pokémon. Like The Lightsaber, it's people trying to imitate something they saw in muggle fiction with magic, so it's not a true crossover. Still works.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Invincible TechnoMage)

Harry Stark, adopted son of Tony Stark. It works... Somewhat.

Linkao3(Mischief's Heir)

Harry adopted by MCU pre-Thor Loki. It also works as wizards are just one of many groups of people with strange abilities.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina)

Regulus has to work with the part of the MI6 that knows about magic to track down death eaters hiding in the muggle world. James Bond crossover.

Linkffn(One Punch Wizard)

Harry raised by One Punch Man. Not really balanced at all.

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Powerful!Harry, Super!Harry, magical theory, Harry/Luna. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun. Complete.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries.

** ASOIAF, Dragon Age, Mass Effect, Star Wars, Code Geass, Youjo Senki, Spice and Wolf, Percy Jackson, and the Marvel universe are all good crossovers that can work well with HP imo. All of them feature either magic, or technology that can fit well in a magical setting, and a great cast of characters that you can craft a story around.

** I'm biased, because it was what got me back into HP fanfiction, but I'd say My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. I'd say that it's a crossover that works mostly in one direction, though, as bringing HP characters into Equestria would not create as interesting situations as vice versa.

There's quite a few fics that have done this already (see [[https://www.fimfiction.net/group/197441/harry-potter-crossovers][this collection on fimfiction.net, for instance]]), but most are examples of what not to do in a HP fanfic. There's tons of extremely clichéd tropes in most of them: apartment trunks and too-friendly goblins and getting Sirius freed before Harry's first day at Hogwarts, to name a few examples.

What they tend to get right, though, is that just about any character from MLP would quickly nestle themselves into friendships with the people around them, and if that includes Harry, they would quickly become a source of affection and support that he needs.

It's also fairly easy to figure out how they would react to various events, as there's a lot of source material by now (on the 9th season at the moment, with a movie and a spin-off series, plus the comics and books), and the characters are mostly well-written, with multiple facets (though Flanderization set in early and has gotten worse over time).

A few other points why I consider the crossover to be a good match:

- There's canon or easy-to-rationalize crossover mechanics: The Crystal Mirror that transports and transforms ponies into a (more or less) human universe and closes after a few days; Discord, the Spirit of Chaos who would think it would be great enjoyment to see what would happen; the odd dimensional portal or magic accident that can trap someone in the other dimension.

- The magic systems are fairly comparable, though if you bring in the top tier casters from Equestria, expect them to quickly rise to power and trash the story as a result. As long as they're reasonably written, any other pony should be in the mid-range of the HP power scale, with the exception that they would likely become very skilled with spells related to their special talent.

- The fish-out-of-water theme from the first books would be easily applicable to a pony from a magical dimension where nature doesn't work, the technology level is 1950s at best, and danger is common but comes with kids gloves.

- MLP characters would consider the Wizarding world to be really irrational, but bring their own brand of craziness to the table.
