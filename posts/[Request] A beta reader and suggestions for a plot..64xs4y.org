Hi everyone, so basically I've been reading a lot of hp fanfictions for a while and I've sort of like been inspired to write a story. So before I start with my idea, I would just like to point out that I used to read Harry Potter years and years ago, so I don't really recall all the exact details.

The plot starts with a Harry that has been "raised" by the Dursleys and definitely hated them... a lot. The Harry I wish to write is a bit different from the cannon counterpart, like his personality is gonna be a bit darker (No voldermort level dark) and you know how forgiving and all he is in the actual story, nothing like that is gonna happen to my version of Harry.

Harry funnily enough befriends Draco Malfoy instead of Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger and I've been thinking of either throwing him in Slytherin or Gryffindor. From 1st to 4th year, things are gonna be the same except Harry may or may not avoid some things. Now from the starting of 1st book to the ending of 3rd book, Harry is going to start learning more things compared to the cannon counterpart, thanks to Draco.

The real plot twist comes when Goblet of Fire starts because an oc of mine comes into the play. This OC is the son of Bellatrix Black and (I'm thinking of Voldemort or another Death Eater, who is not a Lestrange) and basically that OC comes to Hogwarts from being home schooled by his parents and tutors and he is Draco's first cousin, so he is very close with him and also is the best friend of Daphne Greengrass. For names of the OC, I've been thinking of star names like Regulus or Castor. (Could really use some help with the names) So the OC is sent to Hogwarts in 4th year because of the plans which are taking place with the Triwizard cup, he is not a spy or a death eater during that time, just sent to Hogwarts for his own security. Now I am not gonna be make him like super OP wizard but hes pretty strong, just saying. A little bit of history of this OC, he was raised by Bellatrix Black along with his siblings and this Bellatrix wasn't sent to Azkaban nor did she marry into Lestrange line, so after the supposed death of Voldemort, Bellatrix took her children to France and raised them there but she is still very crazy because of dark arts and has tortured her children a lot, especially the oc due to several reasons and the siblings study in Beauxbatons, also the OC becomes really good friends with Harry Potter during the Triwizard tournament year.

So this is the basic plot that has been in my mind for a while now and I've been trying to polish any plotholes that I could come up with really. I would really appreciate it if you guys could point out mistakes and such, since English isn't my first language. Also I really need a Beta reader who could help me with smoothing out grammar and help with some details of HP verse since it has been ages since I saw and read Harry Potter.

makes me think you haven't actually written this yet? So it's much too soon to be looking for a beta. A beta will read through your work when you have made it as good as you can on your own.

It sounds as if you are still in the planning stage and I don't really think anyone can help you with that. Or are you looking for a co-author? That rarely works out very well from what I hear. My advice to you is to write the story first and then come back to look for help with polishing it.

*** I meant as in like writing down my idea in the post but yes I am still working out some details regarding the characters but I have the plot set in my mind, the main reason I want a beta is cause its been ages since I read the book, so I don't really remember some of the finer details. Should've been clearer with it, my bad.

** First of all it's really great that you're writing a fic, it really keeps the community alive. But I also completely agree with [[/u/booksandpots]].You need to think it through and begin writing a few pages to sound the idea out a bit.

The OC seems integral to your plot but people tend to hate OCs and for good reason, writers often see themselves in an OC . So the OC gets amazing powers( I read your post and I know you said that he wouldn't be too powerful but will you be able to maintain that?) and unusual connections (mother Bellatrix and father Voldemort). Is the OC really that important?

And I'd say you need to think about how the story progresses onwards and how long it will be. After you've set your goals for the fic and are ready to fo it, message me anytime if you haven't found a beta by then

*** Thank you so much and i'll definitely do that!

Regarding the OC, honestly I want Bellatrix as his mother because she is crazy asf and my basic idea is that she'll torture him a lot making him crazy and for father, I couldn't come up with a death eater and remembered reading a fic where Harry was son of Voldemort and Bellatrix and yes it is very hard to control the power of your OC since you want "yourself" to be op and all. Honestly... The OC is really not that important until 6th year - 7th year because this is when his work starts.

** I'm going to strongly disagree with [[/u/booksandpots]] and [[/u/Watashi_o_seiko]]: I think that posting an outline and asking for critique is a good thing.

More generally, most authors could use something more than a beta reader but less than a coauthor: someone who is privy to the overarching plans for the fic and can ask questions and point out problems /before/ they're written down in prose and there is a high degree of time and emotional investment in them. In other words, most authors need an /editor/.

I'd go even farther than that: find an editor who likes your idea well enough to donate their efforts but doesn't think like you do. For example, a writer writing a slow-burn romance that takes place over a backdrop of plot and action should find an editor who has little interest in romance but can point out where the plot or the action or the non-romantic attributes of a character don't make sense; and conversely for an author who wants to include romance in their action/adventure plot.
