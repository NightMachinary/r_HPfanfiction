:END:
What I remember of the fic is that baby harry some how during the confrontation with the dark lord when he was just a baby, he get transported back through time to I can only assume is the stone age and has to live day by day to reach his original time. and for some reason it is immortal in the fact that he doesn't die of old age.

  Voldemort intended to kill the whole Potter family, but something unexpected happened. Now, the Dark Lord must face the result of a severely twisted Prophecy as well as a very old... thing. What history can Harry have after this? What history can he make?
