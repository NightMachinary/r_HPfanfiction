I'm mainly looking for Harry and Cedric bonding over the trauma of the incident. Slash or just friendship is fine.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

** linkffn (*FINDING HIMSELF*)

I've not finished this one, but Cedric survives and bonds with Harry, although its much more a Hermione/Cedric story.

  ‘Have you tried everything?' Hermione asked insistently.‘Yes! Every time I get to the cup and Cedric doesn't take it with me I go immediately back to my bed in the morning. But all the times he is with me, he dies and after I fall asleep I return too.'‘I guess it is obvious then, isn't it?' Both Harry and Hermione turned to stare at Ron, who looked at them defensively and shrugged ‘You have to go with Diggory and make sure he survives.'Harry/Cedric - Groundhog day AU

** I read one a long time ago where Tom (I think it was the Diary Horcrux) and Harry are working together or friends can't really remember. What I do remember is that Harry begs Tom to save Cedric ( I think they knew what Voldemort was going to do and planned ahead) and Tom ends up making Cedric a Horcrux ( I think). And Cedric joins them or becomes and ally. I honestly cant' remember much but I'm going to see if I can find it and post a link.
