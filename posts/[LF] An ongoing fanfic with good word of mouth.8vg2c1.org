The last one I've read was Methods of Rationality, which was pretty cool and had some buzz and even anticipation by it's fans at the time. I'm looking for something similar, where romance is second to the story, but still part of it. I can't really find anything kinda like it or just as good as it.

Thanks in advance.


** If you want help finding a fic, generally you need to provide some kind of discriminating information. As it is, the only thing you said was "ongoing fic, good story with less romance," which is not all that helpful.

It sounds like you want to use a request flair, not a fic search flair instead.

*** Thanks for the answer.

Fanfics centered on the books (it can be a retelling of the books from another perspective or something similar) - so no crossover or whatever - , with no original characters included (or just a few), with an adventure flavor.

#+begin_quote
  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.

  Sequel to Child of the Storm. Harry's life has changed a lot over the past year, what with the return of his father, Thor, murder attempts by everything from HYDRA assassins to Elder Gods keeping him on his toes and making a few new friends. But while Chthon and HYDRA are gone, all sorts of dark things have been stirred up, things thought long gone. And guess who they're after...

  Post OotP - Sirius is cleared and finally gets to give Harry the home he had always wanted. But, the war is escalating outside and the Order of the Phoenix needs to rise to the challenge of defeating Voldemort and his Death Eaters once and for all. They just might have to make bigger sacrifices than they had imagined. Harry and Sirius bonding fic. No slash. Semi-canon compliant.
