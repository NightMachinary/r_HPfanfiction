I'm looking for stories where James and Lily were alive, maybe Sirius was their Secret Keeper, maybe they had another idea in store just in case something happened, et cetra; I don't care I just want them alive; somehow.

I don't want any bashing on James or Lily either (Some stories that have James and Lily alive; have bashing on one or both characters)

No Super Powerful Harry

No Seer Luna

Would rather have it be completed.

No Harem Harry

No Weasley bashing either; if you can.

No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione; any other pairing is okay.

Can have Het/Slash/Femslash

If there aren't that many feel free to write it.


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin)

They're alive in this one.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Try linkffn(The Substitute by BajaB). Dumbledore messed things up when he applied the blood wards.

There's also linkffn(A Different Halloween by robst).

I haven't read linkffn(Blood Binding by SphinxScribe) yet, so it may not meet your criteria. Also, Harry doesn't grow up with them.

** You're looking for the Everyone Lives AU by AidanChase. He's slowly going through the entire series and he's just finished OotP. There's a one-shot which explains how everyone lives (Peter saves everyone and dies from Voldemort in the same way Lily did). It's a really good series and not a word for word replay of the books because well... Harry has parental figures now. The craziness still happens because well Harry is still James' son.

  Nighttime was the worst part of Harry's summer. He'd fall asleep, prepared for nightmares. He'd find his nightmares, and when he was startled awake, he'd lie in bed, thinking his mother or father were downstairs, probably having similar nightmares. There was nothing about sleep anymore that held comfort for him.--- --- ---  How different would the world of Harry Potter be if James and Lily had lived?  Ships not listed because I am unsure if they will deviate from canon. Character tags added as they appear.
