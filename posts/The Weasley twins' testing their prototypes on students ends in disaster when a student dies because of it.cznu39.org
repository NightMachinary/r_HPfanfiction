In OotP, Fred and George are testing consumable prank items on First Years. While they may be good at what they do, they aren't qualified professionals.

So, one fine day, a first year student has a bad reaction to a Puking Pastille because he had taken a potion prior to the testing (Hospital Wing, Potions class) which the twins did not account for in their product. The complications result in the student's death.

The twins are expelled and sentenced to Azkaban.

I wonder how canon would change. McGonagall and/or the Gryffindor prefects would face consequences and so would Dumbledore, especially with the Fudge administration in power. Mundungus would also be in trouble since he supplied them with illegal raw materials.

What backlash would Harry face when it comes out that he had initially funded the twins?


** ...Why would they be sent to Azkaban? At no point is it even implied that any of the items they make have any illegal components. If anything, Snape or Pomfrey would be held accountable for not informing them of potential side-effects or substances to stay away from, or the Potions manufacturer if it had been an interaction of which they were not aware or chose not to inform their consumers.

*** I disagree. Look at Hagrid. He had a freaking Acromantula and he got expelled.

I do think that it would be used to attack Harry though.

**** Keeping an Acromantula was illegal.

***** I mean if a student died due to testing that they wouldn't be sent to Azkaban. It was very heavily implied they weren't exactly ethical in their testing.
