So mobile decided it wouldn't start today. Had to factory reset it. Lost about 7k fics. But I still have fav and follows from ffn.

Probably not the most relevant topic here but what do you use? How do you read... I was using an app which isnt to blame for this. I didnt have back up.


** I think its time I went back to reading novels, I have been reading too many fanfics.

** Use calibre on desktop with FanFicFare plug in to download and updated fics. Output is in epub and can be converted into different formats for kindle, mobile etc. It's a great tool if you follow a lot of fics across different sites.

*** Seconded. Also if you keep the files on Dropbox or some other cloud service, you can download them onto your phones and read on your preferred service. I download all my fics as .mobi so I can read them on the Kindle App on my phone.

Personally I download them as HTML into their own folders that I backup to Dropbox. My reading device is my Kindle Paperwhite.

** I use moon+ reader pro for Android if has a auto sync and backup support for Google Drive and Dropbox it automatically syncs your position bookmarks notes and the book it's self. It supports a majority of all the formats and can even backup settings for you. So I hope this helps

** If you use some of the conversion services which send to Kindle, they'll be in your Kindle cloud forever. And there's a Kindle app for everything.

** My sympathies, pal. That really sucks, I mean it. There are few things more infuriating than having to reset a device.

Since I tend to work on my computer seven days a week, that's where I generally read fics. Years ago, for reasons that still piss me off, I learned to backup anything and everything on at least three different formats.

When not working (lel), I use an e-reader for fic reading. Phones are too cramped for me.

Hey, try it; you might find some new stuff that you like. Posting fic searches here might also be a good way to get back what you lost from your original library.

** Besides my computer/Kindle bookmarks, I also tend to email the ones I'd be most... /displeased/ to lose to myself or occasionally make a list of links and post them to Facebook with the Only Me setting to get back to when I can.

I also download my favourites of the favourites for my Kindle Fire and those are automatically stored on a Cloud that Amazon has for such things, so I don't worry about those.

** I convert to .mobi and read them on a Kindle. My problem is that I have no system of keeping track of what I've already read. Sometimes I find myself well into a fic before I realize I've already read years before.

*** I send to kindle too. Sometimes I search my kindle docs to see if I've sent a fic before (I don't delete unread ones). Saved myself some frustration a few times.

** I download them to my computer manually in mobi format. So they are saved on my computer. Then i email them to my kindle, or my phone via the kindle app.

So technically I can have them in 3 places, and I use kindle to read them. The only downside is they are not as easy to "sort" or "find by ___" in Kindle.
