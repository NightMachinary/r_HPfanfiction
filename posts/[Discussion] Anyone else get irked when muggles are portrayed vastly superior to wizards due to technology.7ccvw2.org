I always cringe in fics where I see muggles teaching wizards about movies and showing them how much better muggle culture is and how advanced muggle technology is.

Has anyone ever stopped to consider that maybe wizards are much more advanced than we think. What if wizards can choose a different era to live in every hundred years? When Harry is in Hogwarts its Victorian-era but they could also switch to Renaissance Era or switch to a future era that is very advanced.

I also hate it when people try to make magic understandable by science. Magic breaks all the laws of nature. On that note I'm pretty sure a wizard of Dumbledore's talent could easy take out 10,000 people with a flick of his wand (Not that he would want to). Muggle armies would be completely annihilated by FiendFyre.

Anyway I could go on an on about how magic is really powerful or that wizards have stronger bodies than muggles but I'm going to stop here. Take it away guys.


** I think the issue is best illustrated by the thought experiment of what you would or could do IRL if you had the same powers as a competent HP wizard. You could easily become a billionaire at the very least. Likely you could take over every world government without anyone knowing about it, if you so wished.

That's *one* person.

Another useful comparison is to compare wizarding capabilities with sci-fi universes. Consider Star Trek: teleportation, shields, rearrangement of matter, "energy" weapons, cloaking... wizards have all of these, and moreover they can use them without relying on any industrial infrastructure or power source. On top of that wizards have all sorts of mental manipulation powers.

So saying contemporary Muggles can beat wizards is like saying they could beat the Federation from Star Trek.

The main thing Muggles have going for them is that there are lots of them. But I'm not sure if this is really all that relevant. It's not like there are going to be any pitched battles.

This is the point at which people usually bring up wizards fighting for the Muggle side. But that's not Muggles beating wizards, that's wizards beating wizards.

I've actually wondered about this. Sure, you could easily get the heads of all of the G20 under imperius... but at the end of the day, that's just 20 people, all of whom are responsible to constituencies in their own countries you /can't/ easily imperius.

So controlling the leader is enough, because their constituency can't get rid of them for another, say, 4 years. And if in the next election they do get rid of them, you just put the imperius on the next leader instead.

** Any technological gap Muggles achieve is completely useless unless they develop a technological method for nullifying or blocking magic. Since magic canonically supersedes natural laws (iirc) that is effectively impossible, and the only effective counter to a wizard is either another wizard, or catching him with his pants down/wand snapped/asleep and unprotected.

The whole of Muggle society could be brought down in maybe a few weeks tops by a very small group of dedicated wizards, through clever use of Apparition, the Imperius Curse, Muggle-Repelling Charms, Legilimency, and if necessary Fiendfyre. No matter how antiquated the trappings of wizarding society might be, they have the capacity to read minds, turn any Muggle into an unwilling drone, systematically deny areas to Muggle access, teleport to circumvent any defenses, and unleash self-propagating all-destroying animate fire without counter.

Voldemort didn't need to take over Britain for anything but his own self-aggrandizement. With his Death Eaters alone, properly used, he could have thrown the Muggle world into complete chaos and brought superpowers to their knees. He subverted and overthrew a /wizarding/ government that knew the identity of its foe and that foe's predilection for the Imperius. The Muggle governments would never even know what hit them.

Well, the wizarding government appears to protect the Muggle government - see Kingsley Shacklebolt protecting the PM. Any wizard could easily manipulate the Muggle government. The problem is that other wizards take a dim view of it, and so will stop you.

So if you want to take over the Muggle government, taking over the wizarding government is a prerequisite.

All that said, I'm not sure that Voldemort had any aims regarding the Muggle world beyond the occasional use of Muggles as sport. His focus seems to be more on keeping the wizarding world pure and free from Muggle influence.

So send five Death Eaters instead of one, I guess. Honestly, if Kingsley's the only protection the Ministry sent, the Ministry either doesn't care or doesn't understand how to protect them.

I really don't think there's enough Aurors around to both police the wizarding population /and/ prevent the majority of Parliament from being placed under the Imperius.

Alternately, if the existing Muggle government /is/ well-protected by wizards, use the Imperius to stir up a revolution. Mind-control a suitable figurehead and elite, have them do their recruiting, ram them into the government until one snaps. If your fifth column wins, you've circumvented the Ministry for the most part.

Wasn't he going for Muggle genocide or something? The wiki says the Death Eaters' goals include a global dictatorship under a magical regime. Either way, given canonical abilities of magic, Voldemort could genocide the Muggles first through puppets and front organizations cobbled together by mind control, and then even if he dies on the way to Nazi Wizardtopia the Muggles aren't coming back anytime soon.

That's true. Statistically, you have more chances to survive being shot than being stabbed with a knife. And canonically, wizards are tougher.

Another thing against this 'wizards can be shot with guns', yes they can. The question is how many will go down this way before countermeasures are devised. I'd hazard a guess and say very few.\\
Also, as already pointed out, if the wizards find themselves in a position where they can be shot by muggles, they're doing something wrong.

They can travel with broom, portkey, and apparition, which is much faster than a car and doesn't pollute. They can communicate at long distance with mirrors or floo talk, without having phones sending wave to their brain like mobile phone. They can heal everything that muggle science couldn't dream of, like growing a effing bone back.

Wizards are protected from nukes to the same extent and for the same reason than their muggle counterparts. They happen to live in a country that's sanctuarized and attacking it that way simply equates to suicide for the attacker.

It isn't obvious that they need to know how it works to ward it. It's completely possible that the simple, usual wards they're already using already stops nukes, as magic seems to trump completely the mundane world. The amount of destructive power doesn't really matter in this case, it's about the nature of what you throw at it. You need magic to defeat magic.\\

Actually no, almost all magic feats described in the Books are possible under quantum mechanics/theories. Still, wizards are insanely powerful since they can tap those fundamental forces of the universe with their mere willpower. Muggles are still dabbling in electronic-magnetic forces, and they have no way controlling gravity, nuclear forces, and other quantum level effects.

I think there are very good reasons why so many fics bash wizards:

- HP series was written as children's literature and it's common to dumb down adults. Many people HATE dumb characters. Ministry, Dumbledore, and the Order were depicted as especially incompetent. This kind of characterizations gives up an impression that wizards are idiots.
- JKR actually described the magical world as a horrible dystopia, once readers got past the 'fantastic' facade of the magic. Many readers HATE this world.

Check out [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-point_energy][Zero Point Energy]]. It's very interesting, and there is this quote:

#+begin_quote
  Given the equivalence of mass and energy expressed by Einstein's E = mc2, any point in space that contains energy can be thought of as having mass to create particles. Virtual particles spontaneously flash into existence at every point in space due to the energy of quantum fluctuations caused by the uncertainty principle.
#+end_quote

Furthermore, there is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_particle][Virtual Particle]], and its difference to 'real' particle is basically their lifetime:

#+begin_quote
  As a consequence of quantum mechanical uncertainty, any object or process that exists for a limited time or in a limited volume cannot have a precisely defined energy or momentum. This is the reason that virtual particles -- which exist only temporarily as they are exchanged between ordinary particles -- do not necessarily obey the mass-shell relation. However, the longer a virtual particle exists, the more closely it adheres to the mass-shell relation, so a "virtual" particle that exists for an arbitrarily long time is simply an ordinary or "real" particle. In that sense, electromagnetic waves consist of real photons rather than virtual ones. For example, a typical 700 W microwave oven emits photons with wavelength roughly λ = 3 cm, and produces about 10+26 real photons every second.

  However, all particles were created at some point and will eventually be destroyed in some processes. Since all particles have a finite lifetime, there is no absolute distinction between "real" and "virtual" particles. In practice, in particle physics processes, the lifetime of real particles is vastly longer than the lifetime of the virtual particles and as such the distinction is useful to make.
#+end_quote

Conjured objects in HPverse do not last very long either, compared to 'real' objects (such as protons that live longer than 10^{31} years), but far longer than natural occurring virtual objects that generally exist for less than 10^{-20} seconds.

Nevertheless, this ability alone shows how insanely powerful Wizards are in the HPverse.

***** That's just not how it works. Most notably, magic violates conservation of energy. When conjuring objects, you also get problems with conservation of baryon and lepton number, which implies that conjuring an object would also generate antimatter.

Regarding zero-point energy, it's impossible to extract that energy because the energy at the ground state of a system is already the lowest amount of energy a system can possess. That's not to be confused with the idea of generating energy using the Casimir effect, which is caused by fluctuations resulting from the uncertainty principle.

Sorry that I can't go more into detail, I know the basics of quantum mechanics, but I'm by no means an expert on quantum field theory.

The crucial advantage that technology has over magic is its scalability. Yes, a wizard with a wand can do amazing things. Good for them. But, the rest of humanity doesn't have that option. However, they still can and have benefited from technological progress. Sure, it's more challenging, posing issues of availability, distribution, and education, but as it happens, magic has almost all the same issues.

Technology also requires infrastructure, yes, but it requires it to do something that magic can't do in the first place: reach people (and other beings) who were not endowed with magic by the genetic lottery.

** In just about any kind of conflict, magic would win over technology. But muggle technology is superior in many ways, even if ultimately beaten by magic.

Floo communication is 3-D image + instant transfer of small items, like [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Toast][toast]]. But muggles have mobile, knee-friendly, instant communication to anywhere in the world.

Floo, portkeys, apparition and the Knight Bus is near-instant travel to just about anywhere (at least relatively short distance), or at least very fast travel. Muggle travel is comfortable.

Wizards have pensieves, muggles have movies.

Television and Moon travel is cliché, but still fair points IMO. But the wizarding world might just be too small to support variety or large projects. They have at best a handful of radio channels, and sports and games seems very [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Magical_games][limited]]. They might not need more, but then, do muggles really /need/ Settlers of Catan?

I'd say muggles beat the wizards in imagination and innovation. There's not much in the wizarding world that isn't based on muggle technology. Are there any examples of non-muggle-based stuff?

*** The thing is that Floo communication predates mobile phones, social media, and the internet by several centuries. Brooms predates airplanes and other aerial transport by over a millennium at a bare minimum. Pensieves predates movies by over a millennium at the absolute bare minimum. And this isn't even getting into the various charms and Potions that can cure every single non-magical illness in existence. Health-wise, only magically inflicted damage (i.e. cruciatus-induced insanity) or diseases (i.e. Lycanthropy) would actually affect wizards. But stuff like broken bones and major blood loss can be with very little difficulty, and same would apply for all non-magical diseases (e.g. cancer, STDs, etc)

So stuff like flight, instant communication, and various media was done by wizards long, long before muggles got the idea. The only things that the wizarding world actually really borrowed from the muggle world was the Knight Bus and the Hogwarts Express, and even then the creation of both was influenced by the Statute of Secrecy more than any desperation for it.

What most who like muggle-wank stuff forget is that the wizarding world was far ahead of the muggle world when it came to social issues. Sexism, racism (based on skin color), and homophobia were all non-existent in the wizarding world. To put it into historical context: in the same era of America that the KKK would have been prevalent and when sexism was rife, Magical America had a female non-white president.

Socially speaking, wizards only care about whether someone is a fully-human wizard. Stuff like race and gender and sexuality mean nothing to wizards, not even to pure-blood supremacists. As per Word of God, even someone like Lucius Malfoy wouldn't care about that stuff. Not even Voldemort shows the prejudices that muggles display like racism or sexism, even though he grew up in the muggle world in the 1930s.

If a black wizard like Kingsley wanted to join the Death Eaters, Voldemort would let them so long as they aren't a muggle-born. Even then, Voldemort did try to recruit Lily, and Wormtail is heavily implied to be a muggle-born based on Word of God and Voldemort's treatment of Wormtail in-universe, so Voldemort would certainly allow a black muggleborn wizard into the Death Eater if they are useful enough. Yet neither the KKK nor the Nazis would actually let an non-white and/or Jewish "undesirable" into their group, let alone get a high-ranked position (e.g. being in the SS as a Nazi). Which shows how much more progressive Voldemort is when compared to groups that most compare to the Death Eaters.

*Besides, technology is NOT exclusive to muggles. Wizards can use technology AND use magic. Muggles can only use technology, meaning wizards can literally achieve everything that muggles could achieve and more.* Wizards, objectively speaking, completely outclass muggles in every single aspect. Wizards basically are a master race compared to muggles, since there is no downsides to being a wizard instead of a muggle. Wizards get access to anything a muggle could use, but also can use magic.

*** I read once I think yes it was on Pottermore that magicians DID have a TV channel and TV's at one point but they got afraid and paranoid that any muggles might watch it so they reverted back to the radios! :) SO YES they COULD easily make TV's in the magical world again if they WANTED TO!

**** Yep. People are quick to assume wizards don't have some stuff because they can't when they very well simply might not need it.

Look at computers, for example, wizards don't seem to have them, but if you can make McGonagall's chess set or virtual personalities (such as the animated mirrors), you're probably able to make computers as well.
