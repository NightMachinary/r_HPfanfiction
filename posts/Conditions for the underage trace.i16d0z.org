Is it a magical contract outside of ministry's hands or is it something initiated by the ministry itself, but difficult to undo? Harry was almost a day older because of the events at the end of his Third Year, which seems to have not affected the removal of the trace , a few months following the death of Dumbledore.


** They went back only 3 hours or something like that

**** Hermione used her time turner to attend two additional classes, that would be at most 10 additional hours a week, with a school year being 40 weeks, she would only be about two weeks older.

***** Well yes but if you had a time machine would you use it only for the two classes?

***** I think you also have to allow for extra study time for those classes, but more importantly, Hermione became proficient enough with Ministry Law in regards to the handling of dangerous creatures to give Hagrid extensive notes for Buckbeak's defense, even if he never got the chance to use them.

Which is why I said 10 hours instead of 6.

I assume she did that in her own free time.

** My take on it is that the trace is a nation-wide ward that registers cases of underage magic (defined by the MoM archives, so the real or mental/soul age isn't important, what counts is the date of birth defined on the birth-certificate and the seventeen years age gap) the ministry workers have the job of finding this occurrences, cross-referencing with the know underage wizards in place and sending the letters, the trace also have a “ignoring” function set for when there is an of-age magical in the area, so as to not give false-positives when there is a tutor teaching during summer or when the child is at Hogwarts learning in class/library/wherever. The trace also must have an alert to give more importance for cases where there are muggles around.

The reason the trace can't be set to monitor someone after their seventeenth birthday is actually because it would be forced to monitor everyone who did magic over the said age, thus it would simply give too many alerts to be reasonably investigated to find out who did what spell and where, even more so as it would have to turn off the function to ignore the alert when there is an of-age magical around, thus creating even more alerts to be investigated. In the end it would just not be worthy the effort.

** I've always thought of it as a charm that was created by the ministry, and it's so difficult to undo that even Dumbledore couldn't manage it if he tried. The charm basically attaches itself onto every witch or wizard in Britain when they're born. It knows a certain date (their 17th birthday) as the date to dissipate, so it doesn't really matter what the wizard's physical age is. If the underage wizards takes a permanent aging potion or something (lol idk if that exists) they still wouldn't be able to get rid of it.

** The Trace is a charm that (by like of better terms) attach itself to the underage witches and wizards, and undo itself at their 17th birthday, when they become adult by Wizard standards.

According to the informations given by Dumbledore in HBP, the Trace can only detect if a spell is used in proximity of a minor, and what spell is used, but not who used a spell. Because of this, each Muggleborn get assigned a "territory" inside which he is considered responsible for any spell used (unless an adult wizard take the responsability for it, like Arthur Weasley probably did when he went to get Harry in GoF). Magically raised children are ignored by the Trace, since the Trace would also pick any spell used by their parents (and the main objective of the Trace is to maintain the Statute of Secrecy anyways).

Because of all these factors, we don't know how the Trace undo itself. Does the spell has a countdown which is set to reach 0 at the kid 17th birthday? Is the spell linked to some administrative document and undo itself at the 17th birthday? Or is there some change into a wizard's magic when he becomes an adult?The only thing we can guess with some certainty is that the spell is not linked with the "physical" age, because it would then mean that it would only take an aging potion to cheat the Trace. If anything, it probably use the same mechanism than the one used by Dumbledore for his Age Line in GoF.

As for Harry, we don't know when the Trace failed, since he spent his birthday at the Burrow (a magical household where the Trace is ignored), and in near proximity of Ginny who was still a minor and under the Trace. All what we know is that he didn't have the Trace on him anymore when he started camping with Ron and Hermione.
