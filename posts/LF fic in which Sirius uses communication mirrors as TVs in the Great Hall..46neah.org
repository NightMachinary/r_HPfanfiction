I believe I read this fic after a recommendation from this sub. There was something in it about Sirius and maybe Remus expanding the capabilities of the mirrors and using them as TVs. I think Sirius was raising Harry also. I've tried googling and looking through all the fics I bookmarked, but no luck.


** I've read this one, I'm fairly certain, and it ended up being a business venture, right? Making Muggle products the wizarding way?

  Could a chance meeting change history? What would a different Halloween in 1981 mean for wizarding Britain?

** I'm sure I've read this one. The one where the Marauders are said to make the second task, and Malfoy is Hogwarts champion, right? I have it somewhere in my read list, but I can't remember which it is.

It might be linkffn(The Lie I've Lived by jbern) which, I remember, was one of my favorite Triwizard fics. Maybe not the one you're looking for... I'll look for it later, if you can't find it

Edit: nope, that ain't it. I'll look later
