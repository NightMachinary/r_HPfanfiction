*** You know, I absolutely hated CC when it came out. And I am still not sure if I like the whole idea of it still. But seeing the actual play is truly an INCREDIBLE experience. I went in hoping I wouldn't hate it, because I hated reading it, but man...the experience of the actual play is completely different.

**** The thing is that stage plays and musicals can get away with having incredibly poor writing because of the wonder of live spectacle. I mean look at Cats. Its story is so bad that it doesn't even have one and yet it set records for longest running show in the West End and on Broadway.

**** This is, I think, the biggest disconnect with CC. It's a deeply questionable story with amazing production values. A movie where the script is weak, but the direction and cast are absolutely on point. For some, the experience of seeing it is enough to ignore or justify the flaws. Others can only experience the weakest part, and judge the whole off that.

** Loose Cannon for me. Was supposed to be a cute romcomish story about finding one's self. However the plot got way too ridiculous, Harry got just, increasingly more unlikable and it does that thing some post war fics do where Harry complains about inequality a lot but never seems to do much to fix it even though he could.

**** Yeah, [[/u/Full-Paragon][u/Full-Paragon]] is kind of predisposed to crack.

I mean, Hermione and Luna are drafted into the Weasley family and start answering to the surname "Weasley" and get their hair dyed and it's fully embraced by the narrative.

Sensibility is kind of a lost cause there.

It had a great beginning, but then we find out that Mr. & Mrs. Evans are alive and Lily obliviated them so they don't remember her at all. Then we meet Petunia and her daughter. The woman that raised Harry is not the real Petunia and Dudley is not his cousin. I stopped reading before I found out if they were real people or just creatures that Dumbledore made.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter found a loving home after escaping his relatives, but the wizarding world he's dragged into turned out to be anything but magical. Power, fame, and glory may not bring happiness, but they might just be enough to right the wrongs inflicted upon him. The sequel, Wrath and Remorse, is published on this site.

i cant recommend AD enough tho. it's so good you'll probably still want to read the riddle coins even after this warning. (and you should it's really well written, it... it just goes places...)
