Its is an AU fic with an OC as the main character. I plan to go through all seven years of his schooling and afterwards. It is rated M for lemons and torture that will be in later chapters. The pairing is OC/Lily Luna.

If you are interested the chapter is here: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13376762/1/Aaron-Black-and-Magic-Unknown]]


** It seems good. Only the whole community hates the Cursed Child, and by default all the children. I dont.

I helped my cousin write a time travelling James Siruis Potter fic. Its uncomplete due to personal reasons but from what he told me it barely got any response which was surprising.

I think this fandom should be more geared towards the children, as by now Harry centric stories are getting stale.

So cheers for Aaron Black! Hope you complete it

*** I tend to read a lot of post war stories with adult characters nowadays since I kinda grew up with HP but find it hard to relate to 11yo kids any more. Cant be the only one?

*** I intend to complete it with all seven years, a bit of an adult life and an epilogue, thanks for the encouragement!
