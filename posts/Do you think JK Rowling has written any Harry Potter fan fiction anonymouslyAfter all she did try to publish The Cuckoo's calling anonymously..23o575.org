**** If you haven't read Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness, it's a classic.

Delicate by padfoot4ever is my favorite Scorpius/Rose story of all time.

I adore Harry Potter and the Summer After the War for a great post-war Harry/Ginny.

Consequences by Pandora Jones is an awesome Tonks/Remus fic.

I'll try to come up with more if you like.

***** I've read the first, it was truly excellent.

I've looked up all of them except for the Remus/Tonks fic because I'm one of those defiant Remus/Sirius shippers :P

Thank you for the suggestions!

***** DaYD is written by a sociopath/scam-artist/cult-leader with a huge reputation around the LoTR and HP community. Look up Victoria Bitters (not the beer) on Fanlore

Also, The Werewolf Who Stole Christmas makes up my head canon of Remus/Tonk, and so far no fics has been able to replace it

I don't think it makes the story especially unique, but she does get pregnant in a Delicate and Scorpius is the father. Drunken party in the Gryffindor common room, yadda, yadda, yadda...

******* Well there was a one that I refused to read where Rose gets pregnant. It was one of the top rated fics on ff.net. I think Wizards should have perfect or pretty close to perfect prophylactics and I think of Rose as someone too smart to not be on birth control if she's planning to have sex, then she'd use some type of plan B Wizarding thing too if necessary. So it breaks my suspension of disbelief and isn't attractive in any way really. Not to mention she'd have to decide to throw away her future and not have an abortion as well

** I wish! But I haven't come across anything that even seems like it's written by her. None of the stories I've read have her signature style. Even with cannon compliant stories I enjoyed (Northumbrian, little0bird, DAYD, etc) you can tell that the characters and writing aren't exactly hers. Plus, any new content goes right to Pottermore or would have been set aside her for her encyclopedia.

** I doubt she's writes fanfiction, but I do love seeing stories that are written well enough to possibly be her. I actually know of an author that started out as a Harry Potter fanfiction writer, so there is that wonderful idea that she inadvertently helped spawn other books. I think if JKR were to write more Harry Potter stuff, she would write under her own name. She has a certain style to her writing (I saw it immediately with Casual Vacancy and the like 3 pages I've read of Cuckoo's Calling), and I like to think I would immediately catch on if she ever tried to sneak one past us.

My question is does she ever read fanfiction? Like is there a chance she's read mine? Even that very slim possibility makes me light-headed.

Also, I've had someone tell me that I write a little bit like her. I think I write more like Phillip Pullman, but it was still a nice review. Made me feel all happy inside :)

**** Aww, thank you! I've been writing fanfiction since I was twelve, but only like a quarter of what I've written has ever made it to the Internet. I also stopped during high school because I was too cool for that nonsense, but picked it back up when I was bored in college. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10162339/1/One-Summer][One Summer]] is the story that I'm currently writing. I have a chapter that should be up in a day or two. There are three other documents open on my computer with half a plot penned down, so I'm itching to get this one finished soon. I have so many headcanons, and my goal is create my own universe like little0bird and Northumbrian...except I also want to write about other characters (like the Marauders and Dumbledore).

[[http://fanfiction.mugglenet.com/viewstory.php?sid=18545&chapter=1][Innocent Until Proven Guilt]] was my first ever fanfiction. I lost this one for years, so it's funny to look back. I remember I had it saved in a plastic folder with a cover sheet.

And [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=33027][this]] is my page of mostly abandoned fics from over the years. The one furthest back says 2009, but it's more like 2006. Shades of Gray (/sigh/ published before 50 Shades of Gray, so no relation) is by far my best, and I'm hoping to rewrite that one for my new page.

*** There is like a 2% chance she's never read at least one. Or a friend or editor hasn't sent one they've somehow come across. There's video of DanRad and Fiennes reading slash on Bravo, I would think she's seen SOMETHING in all these years! It could be any of ours! There's one fic of mine I would love for her to have read. The rest? Not so much :P

*** There was a (rather) famous cartoonist for a young-teen comic strip that went on for years in a certain country. One of the running gags was a pair with a girl who was proudly a virgin and her boyfriend's continuous failed attempts to get in her pants.

He drew a comic strip where they finally have sex for an underground comic magazine... and it jokes about how years of sexual frustration (though technically, the comic strip had a simpsonsesque "no time passage" thing going on) were released.

The point of this is that sometimes, an author has to keep to some themes in "proper" publication. HP books have no sexual content, the violence is toned down, and the writing style is purposefully restrained to keep it to a teenage-friendly format. Only in book seven do depictions of violence get gruesome, and even then some facts are glossed over (Lavender died a slow and painful death from Greyback's assault, for instance). There are so many things that JKR hints at and later told in interviews that are quite fascinating for a more mature audience, and the temptation to put it out there for people to read may very well exist.

**** I think the worst hinted-at-but-not-told is Umbrigde taken away in the forest by the centaurs... Well everyone knows what happens to women kidnapped by centaurs (in mythology).

It makes it that much more horrible and cruel that they laugh at her shudders when they mimic the sound of horse hooves.

Your explanation on why she would publish fanfics is interesting however. I'd believe that reason over wanting feedback on her writing.

*** For shits and gigs, I suppose. Maybe she's written something that wouldn't be entirely appropriate for the young HP audience and maybe it only took her am hour to come up with it? She knows she can't publish it but wants to stick it out there and see what happens. We already know she is interested in what the world thinks of her writing outside of her JKR penname.

I wonder if she gets ideas for new parts of the books, missing moments and whatnot. I'm sure she does, like we all do - maybe she's put them online secretly. I would kill to have a peek at her head canon/missing moments.
