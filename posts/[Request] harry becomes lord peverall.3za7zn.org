There probably isn't but thats why I'm here. But I'm looking for a fic where harry finds out he's lord peverall and when he goes to visit the vault all three hallows appear in front of him or some spell or something like that.


** I'm sorry to be pedantic, but it's +Pervell+ Peverell. Well shit. I thought it was Pervell. Are we sure it's not Pervell? I've been reading it as Pervell.

Goddamn my brain.

Anyway, I don't know what fic you're talking about. Sorry.

**** [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Ignotus_Peverell][It's Peverell.]] This actually blows my mind a bit. Every time I read this name my brain read it as Pervell. Literally every time for the past year and a half, canon, fanfiction, /everything/. This is freaking me out, man.

***** I read somewhere that that happens because the words are stored in our brains as images of the whole, so as long as we associate a specific collection of letters with an image, we pull up the image of that word in our mind without actually reading the full word, if that makes sense. So if you misspelled it or saw it misspelled the first time you read it, you might have trouble writing it down. This is especially true with names. That sort of thing is why this works for most people (specifically excluding dyslexics mostly):

** You're going to need a bit more description than that.

Harry as Lord Peverell means literally nothing. That idea was used so many times it [[http://www.adamheine.com/2011/06/tropes-vs-cliches.html][bypassed "trope" and dove head first into "cliche"]]. Literally thousands of stories.

That second part is a little more specific. There's not always a vault, and almost never randomly appearing hallows, but since Lord Peverell is such an obnoxious cliche, many of us have probably skipped over the story you're looking for, so can you tell us a little more about it:

Where was it posted?\\
When did you read it?\\
How many words/chapters?\\
Was it complete?\\
How old was Harry?\\
How much of canon did it have?\\
Any other plot points you might have?\\
Or perhaps a line from the summary (makes it easier to search with [[http://scryer.darklordpotter.net][the scryer]])?
