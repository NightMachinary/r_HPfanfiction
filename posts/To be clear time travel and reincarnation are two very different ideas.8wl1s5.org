I keep seeing fics being recommended as "time travel" fics when they are reincarnation fics.

A reincarnation fic is when a character who has already lived a life or more than one life is brought back to life in either his or her original body or someone else's body in the past (or the future).

Time travel is when someone retains their body as they seamlessly go from one time period to another---future or present. Time travel may result in two of the same people existing at the same moment of time but having different ages.


** theres no reason to not call going back reliving your life as your younger self a form of time travel

this distinction is just your personal preference.

** So by your definition of reincarnation, it's having someone's soul get put into someone's body in a different time? As in, their soul /travels/ through /time/ and enters another body. That sounds like time travel to me.

** I see it as Reincarnation = being born again as a baby.

Transmigration = Soul travels to another body with all its memories. (Not like a newborn child)

Transported = Body travels to another world or place with its body intact.

Time travel = Consciousness travels to your same body whether past or future, or your body travels to its past duplicating itself.

I have to say that the stories where the MC duplicates itself traveling to the past I do not like, I see them more as a plot of transported + time travel than a story only of time travel.

*** There are two types of time travel: Mental and Physical. Mental is the former example you showed, physical is the latter. Time Turners are Physical TT devices, while many fics use the Veil/Obscure Ritual #42 for Mental. Physical has a higher risk of creating a paradox.

** Well to me time travel can either be sending your body in time or send your consciousness/soul in your past (or future even if rarely seen) body. To me reincarnation is being reborn (and often after death) without any memories (or maybe just glimpse of if as dreams or dunno what) of your past life. Even if you're reborn but maintain your memories (as in "Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is") I would treat it as time travel (even if it's somewhat of a ambiguous situation) as you moved what makes the most important part of you in time (your "consciousness").

Sending your body with a total memory loss could be seen as a sort of time travelling but your personality is made from experiences and losing your memory (without any recovery... like ever) and starting anew as a blank slate would clearly change what you are (like a doppelg√§nger or a twin maybe) so it's not really clear cut.

Sending only your soul/"consciousness", reseting the time after the period of your arrival (if sent in the past) is in my opinion the best time travel possible (a bit like saving in a video game and going back to the last save state). Sending the body often create paradox except in the case of some sort of predestination (like JKR time turner (not Curse Child !!!) or the creation of an alternate reality (which is maybe more of a reality travel).

I've seen one fanfic ("Altered Destinies") where the body travel in the past and the timeline is altered and when the birth of the original person occurs well it doesn't till the body pop back in the future (to avoid dual existence) and even if it's really counter intuitive if kinda works. Thanks magic for that

If we were to nitpick we could argue that just living is time travelling forward in time one second at a time.

** Mental time travel IS still time travel! Just like in X Men Days of Future Past, just like in 12 Monkeys, just like in Steins Gate. It's time travel, just another method of it. Reincarnation involves being reborn in the future body of a future person - like a newborn who was born after you died. That's not at all time travel clearly.
