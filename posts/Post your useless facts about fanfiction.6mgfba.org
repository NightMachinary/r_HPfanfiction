** Bellatrix Black and Rita Skeeter were in the same year of Hogwarts (Rosmerta could have been in the year one up from them), but no fanfic that I've seen has ever taken advantage of this fact. There's totally room for a time travelling [Harry, Bellatrix, Rita, Rosmerta] harem fic.

Even just an interesting time travelling [Harry, Rita] fic could be awesome. I can just imagine a 17 year old Rita Skeeta, complete with quick quotes quill, desperately trying to figure out what's going on with this mysterious boy who's turned up out of nowhere.

*** I would read the fuck out of a good Harry/Rita. Harry/Rita/Bella/Rosmerta is like god-tier level crack and I need it now.

*** Holy crap. Would love to see Rita v. Bellatrix as spiteful teenage enemies/frenemies/friends.

Maybe they hate each others' guts and fight over Harry.

Maybe they're BFFs and all the Slytherin boys fear them.

#+begin_quote
  AU, 3-shot, begins during GoF. Harry Potter is feeling down after the reactions after his name is chosen by the Goblet, and he seeks a refuge at the Three Broomsticks one night. See how this seemingly small encounter shapes his aspirations and life.

** Pretty sure it would happen at some point in Harry Potter and the Witches Secret series which is almost toxically bad but has Harry sticking his dick in pretty much every female from the HP universe and more.

** Though there's plenty of Harry Potter/Legend of Zelda crossover fanfic, and a little bit of Harry Potter/Okami crossover fanfic, I haven't yet seen a scene where Sirius Black as Padfoot hangs out with Wolf Link or Amaterasu.
