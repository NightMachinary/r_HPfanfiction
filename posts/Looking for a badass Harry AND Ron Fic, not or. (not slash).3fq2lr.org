Hi

Currently I am looking for any well written fic, which has these basic points in it:

- No bashing (limited bashing if it must be included) of any character without any just reason.

- No slash. (I have nothing against the slash community but everyone have their own preferences)

- Harry and Ron have a very close brotherly bond.

- Both are mature or they become later on.

- Please also list any tight knit Trio fics, in which there is no betrayal and minimum arguments within that circle.

- Ron is powerful in his own right, stands by Harry equally or as much as he can.

- You must have noticed that there is no mention of Hermione, she is optional to be honest.

- Regarding the pairing, I actually prefer exotic ones but normal or canon ones are good too if they are done right.

Thank you!

Edit: About the length of the Fic, I LOVE HUGE Fics but it could be any length if written well.

**** The random unforgivable on Umbridge that goes completely unpunished is also bizarre.

I was disappointed when the author edited the story to remove the story of the gay (Ravenclaw/Hufflepuff) who comes out to Harry and who Harry defends the privacy of. It was a huge character-building moment for a Harry who doesn't seem to care about anyone's feelings.

I was also disappointed that the "Confessions in the Hut" scene was so drastically changed.

***** Oh god, I can understand why he removed the scene. It just came out of nowhere and it was the writer pretty much praising himself for being such a good person. It didn't fit the story at all.

But I agree with the rest of people that that's not even the third worst part about the story. The only remarkable thing about it is the portrayal of Ron...but it kinda explains why Ron isn't portrayed well often.

****** Tbh it kinda bashes and praises Ron at the same time.... In exactly the same way it praises and bashes Harry, Fred, George, Seamus and Dean. Like all of the stuff they do... It's all stuff that normal people wouldn't do.

Don't get me wrong, I loved reading a fic where Ron and Harry were badass and on great terms with each other, but I felt kinda let down by the reasons why they were badass and on great terms with each other.

It also told me that the author is very much pro-capital punishment.

I agree actually. Especially when there are witnesses... Like the entire Order of the Phoenix and the entire population of Hogwarts just standing there watching them and doing nothing. Even more so when it says in the next paragraph that some of the students were traumatised by the events that had transpired.

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Cannon to Epilogue, then not so much...

** There's "Hermione Granger and the Boy who Lived" by DianeCastle ([[http://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=30822]]). It's an AU where Hogwarts is not a magic school, but a school for spies like James Bond. Ron Weasley is Ron Wellesley, blue-blooded spy in training. Best friend of Harry and Hermione, who has a crush on him since first year, but keeps telling herself she has no chance against all the noble girls after Ron. Ron's a master Martial Artist, excellent shot, and James Bond material.
