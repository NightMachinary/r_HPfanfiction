He could be a Professor, he could be a trainer for Aurors, he could be a Quidditch player, or just whatever else. Just looking for stories where he isn't an Auror.

I know that's what he said he wanted to be, but after killing Voldemort, after defeating other Death Eaters after the war, I'd just assume that Harry would be tired of fighting, with the way he was portrayed by canon. He'd probably want some other job.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual (Doesn't have to be focused on a pairing).

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can have any warnings.

NO OP Harry, no Lord Potter, no Harem Harry. Harry slightly more powerful or slightly smarter then in canon is perfectly fine, but I'd like for it to be somewhat believable.

No Weasley bashing.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.


** This is a good Professor Potter story with Harry/Ginny and I find all the characters to act true to character. It isn't finished but has been updated within the last year so I've been assuming it isn't abandoned.

  At twenty-five, Harry Potter is at a crossroads in his life. He's achieved his dream of being an Auror, but it's not all it's cracked up to be, and with one child and another on the way, he's missing out on precious time with his family. But being an Auror is all he knows how to do - right? So he's in for a surprise when Professor McGonagall, Headmistress of Hogwarts, offers him a job as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher ...

** I got a couple for you my good friend.

First linkffn(Loose Cannon by manatee-vs-walrus)

It's a solid story about Harry who, during a conversation with George W. after the war, realises that he doesn't want to be an auror, and just wants to enjoy his life. So he quits, starts playing Quidditch and lives his life.

It is well written, and good fun. Last updated on the 3rd of May.

Second linkffn(Novocaine by StardustWarrior2991)

This is a story on which Harry also quits being an auror, however, and I know you said you didn't want lord Potter, but this is honestly brilliant. He gets a massive inheritance and uses his power to clean up the wizarding world. He is not oppressive as a Lord, and the is not too much Lord drivel.

It is brilliant, last updated in February and I am doing for the next update

  He survived the war---now it's time to grow up. Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. OCs galore. NO MORTAL PERIL.

I suppose that's okay, something I could see canon Harry try to do, if he was richer or slightly more powerful or whatever.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".

** Turn, by Saras_Girl: Starts the day of canon's epilogue and undoes all of that garbage. He's head auror, but after spending a little time in an alt universe to see how much better his life would have turned out had he made other decisions, he quits and becomes an artistan on Diagon Alley. Eventual slash, Drarry. Complete. No bashing. My favorite fanfiction.
