I know there are fics that are about the Dursley's time with Hestia/Dedelous, but I read one a while ago in which the Dursleys were attacked 6 years after the war ended and were temporarily staying with Harry because he was capable of protecting them. Unfortunatley i think the fic was abandoned and had like two chapters.

Are there any other fics with a similar premise? Basically the Dursleys kind of living in Harry's environment, even if it' just for a short amount of time.
