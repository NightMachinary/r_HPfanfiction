See title.

I have a long break coming up and I am looking for the longest fics that will keep me busy for a while.

Thanks!


** You can search this sub for similar threads, but the two I always recommend are "Hermione Granger and the Boy who Lived a nonmagic, superscience, MI6 AU and the Dangerverse which is a series that begins with linkffn(Living With Danger). The first you can google as it is not on any of the bot supported sites and I can't look up the link right now sorry! With the second some people have mentioned that the writing in the first fic is not as good as the rest of the series, but it is still quality wise better than average fic in my opinion. The first book was the authors first fic, so it is understandable. It's probably the nostalgia talking a bit, but the first book is still my favorite.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6765496/chapters/15463549][Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach]] linkao3(6765496) is over a million words long. If I recall correctly, it gets really mugglewanky, but I still enjoyed reading the whole thing.

  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?

** The "Innocent" series is over a million words, active, and has only reached year four thus far. The first book is nearly half a million all by itself and takes place before Hogwarts.

linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7)

It doesn't drag, though; it uses all that space to flesh out a lot of characters who don't get much screen time in canon, and to show a lot of things that canon only tells us about (like Ginny's year with the diary). It's great writing.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

** Most of the really long ones I can think of have one think in common: Snape is Harry's Dad in some way or other.

- Like none other series by Aspeninthesunlight, 1.5 million words and growing, Snape adopts Harry

  [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/aspeninthesunlight/pseuds/aspeninthesunlight]]

​

- Leo Inter Serpentes Series by Aeternum Ao3

[[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Aeternum/pseuds/Aeternum]]

​

- A Very Slytherin Harry by geoffaree\\

[[https://archiveofourown.org/users/geoffaree/pseuds/geoffaree]]

​

- Blood Magic by GatewayGirl on Ao3

​

- A New Place to Stay by DebsTheSlytherinSnapeFan, another Snape adopts Harry story, the same author also wrote "Willing" (HP/SS) which is half a million words plus a lot of other stuff, [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/DebsTheSlytherinSnapeFan/pseuds/DebsTheSlytherinSnapeFan]]

​

If you are more into Gen, check out the Draco Triology by Cassandra Claire

[[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Draco_Trilogy]]

My fav part is the alternative universe thingie where Lily survived and had 3 more children, making Harry the oldest of 4.

​

And two of the best longer fics that I have read in a while would be

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6701647][Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood]] by cambangst and

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4267422][Fate Is A Four Letter Word]] by Philo. Yes, the pairing is of "Fate" weird, but it is really really good. Scroll past the smut and treat it as a "who dun it" if you aren't into it.
