would like to know Fics that have a MC that has a thing for older Women. This attraction can happen during the (later) school years, but also post-hogwarts. It doesnt matter who the MC is. AU Fics are also ok. What i had in mind would be Fics with erotic or teasing moments. So the MC shows more or less visible interest in the Women. Lets say Harry is ensnared by Narcissa or Bella. They can reciprocrate those attraction because they also find him good looking or they are using his attraction for their own good.

Romance can happen aswell, but i would like if it would happen rather late. Most of the Time, the MC would be driven by his Lust/Love/Hormones for his Lady. Sex scenes can be detailed or hinted. It doesnt matter if it has (consensual) infidelity...so the Spouse knows about his Wifes affair but ignores it for the advantages that they would gain. But the whole attraction stuff doesnt have to be on a manipulating thing, its just an option.

Teddy/Hermione. Pretty wholesome, haven't read the entire fic. The author is good on the technical side of things, but I can't vouch for the plot.

  When Hermione gives in to temptation and kisses a much younger man, she has no idea how her life is going to change. As Hermione and Teddy navigate a new relationship, they also have to deal with her misgivings regarding their age, his insecurities, her children, his godfather, her ex-husband, and a case at work that keeps them busy.

** linkffn(11669575) : This fic is very well written and Harry has multiple relationships with older women. However IMO the author made this thing more unreadable the more he included his version of Luna. And sadly 1/3 through the story she becomes a main character...
