I read a couple Harry/fem!Harry stories recently, with Harry crossing dimensions, meeting and helping his female counter part but I was wondering if there are any fics out there where a possibly older fem!Harry crosses dimensions to come help canon harry instead. They don't have to be paired together but doesn't matter to me. Just curious. Let me know. Thanks.


** linkffn(Potter vs Paradox by Belial666) mostly fits this.

  The Girl-Who-Lived won; Magical Britain never recovered. As their world grows closer to another war, the surviving DA members concoct an elaborate plan that will see Iris Potter back in time to guide her younger self and prevent the war from ever happening. Fate however has other plans. GWL BWL, dark!Harry, timetravel, canon magic.

  Pre-5th year, Harry is visited by a woman claiming to be his magical Aunt Holly, except that she can't cast spells... or keep her hands off of him... or stay out of trouble. Holly/Harry/we're not sure what'll happen. Not just naughty- it's knotty (as in subject to entanglement).

*** I'll 2nd this one with the caveat that the porn in it is really hard to read at points. You'll do a lot of skimming if you have any kind of standard.
