I have many works in progress that I write at the same time the current one that I'm really focusing on has a summary of this so far.

Deirdre Tremlett is the beloved younger sister of future wizard rock star Donaghan Tremlett. That's the not the only thing she has on her plate. She has a loving boyfriend but nagging feelings for a certain ginger prefect and Quidditch star . After finishing Hogwarts in 1991, her relationship with her boyfriend is in shambles and her friendship with Charlie is more strained than usual.

The story starts in 1990 (the beginning of their seventh year) and probably ends sometime in 1999.

I have about 26 pages written in google docs.


** Sounds a bit stiff to me. Using 'beloved' and 'loving' sounds kinda repetitive, as is the repetition of the last name 'Tremlett'. You could cut out Dierdre's last name, so it reads like: 'Deirdre is the beloved younger sister of ...' It would sound better, imo, less repetitive, and readers will still be able to infer that her last name is Tremlett.

I'm also not a fan of 'finishing Hogwarts in 1991'. The year she finished Hogwarts in is unnecessary information, and makes it sound very factual, like a history fact or something.

Another thing is that the flow from sentence to sentence seems unrelated. You first stated that she is the younger sister of future wizard rock star, but I don't see the relevance of this in the larger story. If, for example, you tied in this fact with the rest of your summary, e.g., 'Deiredre Tremlett is the ... Donaghan Tremlett. She has a lot on her plate--telling her brother's crazy fans that /no, she does not give out his autographs/, or /no, she won't introduce them/ and even /no, she does not fantasize about snogging her brother, what is wrong with you people/. Luckily, she's got a loving boyfriend to support her through it all. Well, it'd be lucky if she didn't have these persistent feelings for a certain ginger prefect and Quidditch star who is certainly /not/ her boyfriend.'

Sorry, I kind of went overboard on that example, but I was having fun coming up with the weird shit fans might ask Deirdre. Anyway, the point is, it would flow better if you provided a specific reason why readers should care that Deirdre is some rock star's sister. There's also a bit of a time skip between those last two sentences that have me wondering: wait, how did it go from a loving boyfriend to a relationship in shambles? I think you should leave out the last sentence entirely, as the story is beginning in 1990. Maybe imply that her relationship is going down the drains, but don't outright skip to post-graduation if you're starting during their seventh year? Because the last sentence is also giving me the impression that you're fic is starting after she graduates, and I wouldn't have known otherwise if not for the additional information you provided.

This turned out to be a bit +rambling+ long, and I might have been a bit nit-picky, but I'll just finish with this: this is all just a matter of my opinion. As with all writing advice, take it or leave it; the most important thing is that /you/ are happy with the final result.

*** I will skip to post graduation maybe after Christmas since I have no other ideas for what can happen in the her last six/seven months of Hogwarts. I actually liked all the advice. I written up until Christmas of 1990.

It's explained how her relation with her boyfriend goes from long to in shambles in the story.

***** It makes senses why it would come across that way in the summary. I was originally going to go through all seven years but I just wrote a flashback to their first year in 1984.

** Perhaps make it clearer that /Charlie/ is the one she has feelings for? When I read the phrase “certain ginger prefect and Quidditch star” I actually wasn't certain which ginger prefect you were referring to. The Weasleys produced four, three of whom were Quidditch stars, which didn't help the confusion at all. (That's not even getting into the twins, who were non-prefect Quidditch stars.) Also maybe I'm just dense (I am), but the phrasing kind of made me think there might have been /three/ guys in the picture: BF, prefect /and/ Quidditch star. Maybe something like: “Charlie, the Quidditch star-prefect” instead?

Also, it would sound more engaging if it was clearer why the brother's career is important to Deirdre's story. Does she feel overshadowed? Does she have a hand in managing his career? Fend off his crazy fans who are dead certain that she's not actually his sister but a girlfriend with a cover story? A good summary distills the story down to its essence, so if it is not crucial to the setup and plot,it could be cut altogether. Since he's a /future/ rock star you could use it to describe Deirdre further. Such as “Deirdre Tremlett's brother Donaghan knows exactly what he wants: to be a rock star. Deirdre wishes her own dreams and desires were so clear cut.”

Also the skip forward in the summary kind of makes it sound boring. Sure, its your story and you do what you want. But if you plan to set any of the story at the start of 7th year, telling us what happens after graduation kind of spoils the story for the reader because not only do they know what happens, it seems like that part of the story is unimportant. Nobody likes it when even the author brushes off part of the story is too boring.

Every story needs conflict. Not necessarily action movie conflict, but readers like to know what challenges the characters will overcome, so we know what sets this story apart from others and what the reader can expect (if there's an epic plot involving dragons or anything, that should be mentioned) Perhaps emphasize the love triangle conflict. For example: “Deirdre knows her boyfriend loves her and she loves him back. So where's the perfect bliss she's supposed feel? Why does her friendship with Charlie fill her with happiness and excitement that her boyfriend doesn't? All she knows, is that she'd definitely be happy if she could sort this out without ruining both her friendship and her relationship. She finds that highly unlikely”

Sorry if that doesn't quite match up with what you had in mind for her character. :) But you get what I mean, right? But honestly, my best advice is to write a more so you can have a better idea of your plot structure, and what is really important to tell your reader.

Good luck with your story! :)

*** I've written up to Christmas of their seventh year. Most of the band members besides Donaghan (he finished Hogwarts after her sixth year) and one or two others have finished Hogwarts. She connects the youngest band member (Merton Graves) with her brother and she has a relatively good voice. Every now and then she sings with her brother's band but she rather be in the background.

This is the summary from someone else. Deirdre is the beloved little sister of the bassist of The Weird Sisters Donaghan Tremlett. She has a lot on her plate--telling her brother's crazy fans that no, she does not give out his autographs, or no, she won't introduce them and even no, she does not fantasize about snogging her brother, what is wrong with you people. Luckily, she's got a loving boyfriend to support her through it all. Well, it'd be lucky if she didn't have these persistent feelings for a certain ginger prefect and Quidditch star named Charlie Weasley who is certainly not her boyfriend.

** Maybe something like this? I took out the second sentence and added a bit.

Deirdre Tremlett is the beloved younger sister of future wizard rock star Donaghan Tremlett. She also has a loving boyfriend but nagging feelings for a certain redhead prefect and Quidditch star is starting to affect her relationship with her boyfriend. After finishing Hogwarts in 1991, her relationship with her boyfriend is in shambles and her friendship with Charlie is more strained than usual.

I'm assuming that the plot is primarily a story about Deirdre/Charlie/boyfriend love triangle? If it's not then you should note that in the description. Also note if the main "Harry Potter" story will affect this story in any serious way.

*** It is very much a love triangle especially in their seventh year though neither Charlie or Deirdre notice it. Though maybe their respective best friends Cheryl and Dora might.

In 1991, Deirdre and her boyfriend Adam end their relationship right before Charlie tells Deirdre he's going to study dragons. She takes Charlie's departure much harder than Charlie sees.

While in Romaina he realizes how much he cares about her and that he's been denying his feelings for her for possibly years. Though, he thinks she's still in a relationship with her boyfriend.

**** Is the story centered on Deirdre or Charlie? Whose perspective dominates the storytelling? Also, is it told in 3rd-person or 1st?
