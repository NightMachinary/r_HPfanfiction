So, I've been rereading Arabian Nights recently - great story, btw, I highly recommend it if you're into older books - and the idea got me thinking. What kind of Frame Story would work/would people like to see for a Harry Potter fanfiction?

For those who don't know, a 'Frame Story' is one where a lot of shorter stories are bound together by a secondary narrative that introduces, interlinks, and bookends the stories themselves. They're essentially used to comment on, or tell, another story within the story.

In the case of Arabian Nights, the Framing Story is that Scheherazade is telling stories to her husband so he doesn't execute her (he's a ruler of a kingdom well known for marrying someone one day, then executing them the next) - she tells a story each night, then leaves it on a cliff-hanger so he won't execute her and therefore never hear the end of the story. In some versions, she tells a thousand and one stories until she eventually runs out.

For those who've seen The Princess Bride, the Grampy-Grandpa telling the story to his sick Grandson is another example, but with only one story being told throughout the frame of him and the boy talking about what's happening.

So yes, how would you write that kind of 'story within a story' in Harry Potter fanfiction? I'm curious if people have any thoughts on the notion. :)

(Also, if you have any examples where it does happen, please do feel free to link! No criteria whatsoever, post what you want, any tropes, any sexuality, any pairing - just let me know if it's smutty and whether I can skip the smut without losing character/plot development).

** A parent reading some story to his child before bed, you could probably have the "real world" part continue for a bit even after the child is asleep to show how the world is changing (muggleborn in hiding during the blood wars, Death Eater parent, or just a normal family in a post canon setting . . .).

As for the tales read to the child, "The Tales of Beedle the Bard" is the first thing that comes to mind, but belongs to Rowling. Fanon invented the "Adventures of Harry Potter" books, and I could easily see Arthur Weasley read them to Ginny. I could also see Hermione talking about the history of Hogwarts to her children, and illustrating each trivia about the school with a little story she wrote herself.

*** Heh. I really like all of those ideas - though I'm definitely enamoured of Hermione's edition of 'Hogwarts, A History'. That'd be such a fun thing, especially with her own marginalia commentary and life stories added in. Might work as a melancholy thing too, if they took it in a similar direction to that one-shot of Colin Creevey creating photographs of the Post-War. Might even work as a Time-Travelling Hermione story too, if someone wanted to do a version like that. Definitely a lot of potential there.

In all honesty, I'd also be really curious as to the bedtime stories a Death Eater would tell their kids. Like, what kind of propaganda would those stories try to convey? Like the Harry Potter stories in reverse with more racism? "Lord Voldemort and the Mudblood Purge"?

And hell, the idea of a Muggleborn Anne-Frank-type being told stories while in hiding would be interesting as well.

I say again - I really like all of those ideas. Kudos on that creativity, fellow online person. Might be worth putting them out as a prompt to see if anyone bites. :)

** reading to children is best based on the tone of the books but there is also telling a spouse about it or a therapist.

it allows one to use the narrator to kind of give meta comments on it as they discuss actions they might have glossed over with an equal.

id imagine discussing harrys second year with his wife would be more illuminating on the ridiculous trauma and danger he was in as opposed to children listening without truly understanding.

*** I do like the idea of Harry finally talking about his life experiences with someone, be it a therapist or a partner. That'd be a really interesting retuning of the series, I think. It's often said that the tone changes considerably and it's all really inconsistent, so Harry going back as an adult without the naivete of youth could be a really interesting spin on the same events. Same stations of canon, but through a different lens.

** I've seen the Marauders hanging out, trying to scare each other with stories. Don't remember the name of the fic, sorry.
