I know it's a cliche trope but I love it.

Would prefer canon pairings and post hogwarts/voldemort. It could be for any reason, he simply grew apart from everyone, moved to another country, moved to the muggle world... anything! Can be full of angst, jealously, drama... the more the merrier. I prefer no character bashing though.

​

I can't seem to think of any examples that I've read besides Restless Heart Syndrome by notadryeeye, if anymore come to mind I'll update this.

​

Thanks guys!

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.
