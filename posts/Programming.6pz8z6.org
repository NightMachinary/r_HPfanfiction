** The closest thing I can think of is [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]. It's a non-magical AU, though, but a fantastic read!

***** It's not an official sequel. There's a lot of fanfiction of hpmor that picks up where the story left off.

#+begin_quote
  The Dursley family, who valued normalcy above all else, would of course never dream of keeping their orphan nephew in a cupboard, or of making a spectacle of him. That isn't to say they wanted to spend all of their time and money on him, however. From the salvage of broken toys and unwanted junk, left alone to his own devices, Harry built dreams.
