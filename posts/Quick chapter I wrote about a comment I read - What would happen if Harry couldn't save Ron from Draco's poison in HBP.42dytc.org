** I'm curious about the consequences. Will we see Draco killed for this? And the Malfoys killed for his failure? Snape punished for helping Draco? Will Dumbledore finally realize just how evil it was to protect Draco instead of the innocent students?

****** If Dumbledore still protects Snape and Draco, then I think he just lost the war unless he can cover up just who did this. Even if he comes clean I think the rift between him and Harry (and Hermione, and all of the Weasleys) won't ever be healed.

That's why I hate that book. It turned Dumbledore into an evil idiot.

******** Didn't Harry suspect Draco was up to something? Wouldn't he suspect Draco now even more so? And wouldn't Hermione support him now? (Not that her stupidity with regards to Draco ever made sense in the first place.) I'd say that without Dumbledore pulling strings, they'll find out Draco did it.

** It's generally well written, but I thought it had a lot of extraneous divergences. It's not an exploration of what happens if Harry can't save Ron. It's an exploration of what happens if Harry can't save Ron /and/ the poison poisons a bunch of other random people /and/ Harry himself almost dies /and/ Harry is Very Powerful. There's tragedy, and there's grimderp with a side-order of edginess, and this fic seems to be veering into the latter territory.

Also, it's been a while, but is Slughorn really that inept?

Some bits of fanon crept in --- like the Potions Master thing: in a traditional British school system, it's a position, not a skill rating, with an "/X/ Master" being the teacher in charge of teaching of subject /X/, whose duties include organizing and supervising other teachers of /X/.

  For the Potions Master thingy, I took reference of this article from Harry Potter Wikia, which says that the title of Potions Master is another title of the current Potions professor of the school.
#+end_quote

Ah, that makes sense. May I suggest changing "a Potions Master" to "the Potions Master"?

#+begin_quote
  I don't think Harry being powerful is fanon.
#+end_quote

I didn't mean to refer to that as fanon. It's a perennial topic of debate with the fandom (though some models for "magical power" like magical cores are, explicitly, fanon). I was going off the fanfic tag, more than anything.

#+begin_quote
  And I haven't displayed Harry as being Very Powerful, he is emotional, and emotion drives his most powerful feats of magic, as seen in canon. It's definitely canon that he is extremely capable, but magical power isn't what the canon series is about, it's a hodge podge of different genres and life lessons.
#+end_quote

The effect with things shaking as he cast the Summoning Charm wasn't bad, though I do think that the general sense of /nothing/ happening would have worked better.

#+begin_quote
  Being fanfiction, I don't need to introduce things as canon did, I'm aware the reader already knows a lot about the world of HP already so I don't need to go back to basics for a lot of stuff. I can explore other avenues as I wish (i.e. magical power) so long as the underlying world remains unchanged (i.e. Horcruxes exist, Voldemort is unhinged.).
#+end_quote

I guess if wizards get more powerful with angst (a la linkffn(11633666)), Harry, Hermione, and all the Weasleys are about to get a huge powerup. Voldemort better beware. :D

*Harry:* OK, I am three dead friends worth of angst away from being powerful enough to defeat Voldemort...

*Voldemort:* Young fool! I have used my mastery of Occlumency to make myself */suffer constantly/* all these years! If it weren't pointless due to horcurxes, I would have */killed myself/* years ago! You cannot catch up with me!

#+begin_quote
  The additional deaths from the poison are a worst-case scenario sort of thing.
#+end_quote

I understand; and my opinion is that it's extraneous and distracts from the main premise of the story. Between Slughorn's death (before he reveals what he knows), the a large-scale intervention by the ministry, Harry being the only survivor, and Harry (and possible Hermione, given the tag) getting what sounds like a power upgrade, whatever that means... Ron's death is just another change, perhaps not the most important one.

Anyway, it's your fic. I'm just the peanut gallery.

** I see that yet another author has fallen victim to the stupidity of referring to Hermione as 'Mione. Seriously, don't do that.

Apart from that and a couple of spelling errors, that was pretty good. It actually made me think that if Ron had died at that moment, it would be arguably be worse for Hermione, simply because at that point in HBP, she and Ron weren't speaking to each other and they would have ended on a bad note.

Fair enough, but I consider it to be basically the same based on how they happened.

I just don't get that scene at all though. How were there still that many kids anywhere close enough in the infirmary while poppy and the other healers are trying to work and dumbledore is there? there's no logic behind it. The crowd is so bunched in that harry is able to projectile vomit on them from his bed, yet doesn't get Dumbledore or the healers at all? At least have it make some sense like one healer was killed and other injured or whatever.

#+begin_quote
  Four students are thoughtless enough to touch the blood.
#+end_quote

so they reached out and touched it... why? would they not be turning and running instead of poking at blood of all things?
