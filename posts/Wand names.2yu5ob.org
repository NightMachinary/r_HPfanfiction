It struck me as weird that wizards don't name their wands. I mean, many people name their cars, and the bond between a wizard (or witch) and their wand has to be stronger than the bond between a person and their car.

Any thoughts about this? Any stories where a character named their wand?


** While they exhibit a personality, I don't believe that wands would recognize their own name, at least one given to them by another. Then again, if they did they might insist that you always say their name first before casting a spell, so they knew you meant them to do it. Also, it's a rare wizard who can get their wand to act when they're not already in contact with the wand (Harry Potter being a rare wizard). Yet, if they were more likely to respond to verbal instruction, how dangerous would it be if someone else could incant a spell out of your wand just because they knew you had named it 'spikey'?

Harry kneeled next to his friend and said, "Hold still while I repair this bone--"

"Hey spikey! INFLAMARE!" Fred interjected.

Ron leapt up and ran around the room, waving his broken arm around trying to get the fire on his sleeve to go out.

"Are you /sure/ you're on our side?"

Fred answered, "I'm on /your/ side."

*** I can so see Fred doing that.

I hadn't thought that wands would recognize their own name, nor even require being addressed in order to be used.

More just the same as people naming their cars. The bond being personal, it seems odd to simply think of a wand impersonally, such as "where's my wand?" But rather, "Where's Betsy?"

**** Somebody naming their wand Betsy is the funniest fucking thing I've read in days. That needs to be a fic yesterday.

** The reason is because while olivander may push the fact that wands are sentient and they must be but in everyday life a wand is just a tool but not like a hammer more like your own hand. You dont name your hand until youre very lonely.

** I think that they don't name their wands because they aren't very sturdy. I mean they are made out of /wood/ . A sword or a car can last a lifetime but I think a wizard, even if he cares for his wand especially, will break it accidentaly after a few years.

*** It does seem like wands would be rather breakable, doesn't it.

But the only two times that I can think of wands breaking, one was due to the Whomping Willow (Ron's wand, 2nd year), and the other due to a blasting curse (Harry's wand, 7th year).

If they were so easily breakable, I would have imagined that plenty of wands wouldn't have been broken, in the normal course of action. E.g. leaving a wand on a couch and someone accidentally sitting on it. That we would have heard about it happening more often. I mean, expelliarmus throws the wand across the room. Don't tell me that easily breakable wands are always going to survive hitting the ground or wall. (Not everyone is a seeker that catch a wand out of the air.)

As far as I can tell, most wizards and witches keep their wands for a fair number of years.

Regardless, we are also told that the bond between a wizard/witch and a wand is rather personal. That /this/ is my wand, and woe be unto anyone who takes it away. It seems like the type of bond that lends itself to being named, regardless of how long such a bond may or may not last.

**** I mean, Neville inherited Frank's wand. So clearly it's long lasting.

The Elder Wand lasted for centuries. Even as Harry just snapped it with his bare hands without ceremony (canon question: is that just movie-verse?)

****** I think it's more keeping it a legend than preventing anyone else from being its master ever again. You gotta figure after years of auror training (that surely includes dueling/sparring) that it'd be damn near impossible to figure out who was the wand's master by the time Harry graduated.

**** Well I don't know, the wands have a pretty wide girth to them, if I remember correctly you can't even get your fingers completely around the bottom half of the wand correctly, but I might be wrong. My point is, that a wooden stick, even if it is slightly hollowed out, isn't that easy to break, so I don't think just by sitting on it would break it. On the other hand, the prisoners are sometimes punished with their wands being snapped, which if done by hand, supports my theory.

** I think it would be something more as a joke. Like the name would be something really silly, and the owner would only really refer to it as that when they were trying to be funny. Not everyone names their car, but when they do it's usually something ridiculous. My brother has a jeep he calls "The Sloppy Hoe"...so it'd probably be along the same lines.

** I don't know about you and the people you hang out with, but I don't know anyone at all who gives his car a name. And I would consider someone who did a freaking weirdo.

*** Never claimed to myself. Dont even have a car, actually. People name their boat, is it really that far of a stretch that they name their car? A quick google search showes that it isnt that unusual.
