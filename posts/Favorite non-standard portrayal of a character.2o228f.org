I usually see Daphne the ice queen, Tracey the cheering charm personified, Ginny the love potioneer, luna the seer, and more often than Nott if Theo is in the story he's the product of an abusive DE father, and then there's Blaise and his mum's ever expanding list of former husbands... but whats the your favorite incarnation of a character that /ISN'T/ the usual setup?

Example: I recall a dimension hopping story where Harry met a Hermione that had taken to sports instead of books and I think responded to +Malfoy+ (apparently it was Neville) by hitting him with a field hockey stick.

Edit: [[/u/rozn]] pointed out that I forgot to link to the story with Sports!Hermione so: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6451035/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Second-Life][Harry Potter and the Second Life]]


** The Gilderoy Lockhart in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Oh God Not Again]] is my favorite version.

Still a thief, but a mentor to Harry on how to monetize his fame.

*** Yeah, I felt like that Lockhart is one of the more... self aware?... incarnations I've seen. Which is interesting in a way, that in a fic that's tends towards the somewhat ridiculous, Lockhart of all people is made a touch more serious and played straight whereas in a lot of fics that are trying to take themselves more seriously Lockhart is a series of one-off gags.

** Cormac McLaggen gets the full frat-boy treatment in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5445767/1/Whatever-Happened-to-Bromance][Whatever Happened to Bromance?]], and it is glorious. Utterly sophomoric, but glorious.

** I've just reread [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2750775/1/The-Code][The Code]] trilogy and I like how they wrote both Bill and Draco. Bill is an awesome dude who you wish was your older brother and Draco is a prickly genius. It's a pity it's incomplete.

*** Agree. The first one was a bit shaky (seriously, I get it, Dracos a genius) but they got better. But I love Bill and Draco as characters so maybe bias.

*** I like when Draco is portrayed as smart. In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9720829/1/That-Missing-Something][That Missing Something]] he's written as quite intelligent and I love it. And it's fun when he strikes up a friendship with Hermione because both of them run on the same genius wavelength.

** I love this sort-of-sympathetic Cormac and Lavender oneshot, [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=289998][It's Only Love]]. They're quite canon, but it's rare to find good portrayals of them in fanon. It's droll and bleak and pretty much how I can imagine their relationship going.

Also [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=308522][The Satellite Heart]], which has a Harry who suddenly begins to have dreams of an alternate universe where Voldemort doesn't exist and he's with Draco, and it covers a lot more ground than one would first expect. Harry actually struggling to accept this world and relationship, his meeting with alt-world parents is heartbreaking, and the other character cameos don't really follow fanon either.

*** Is Lavender the stereotypical "buxom blonde" that so many authors write her as?

**** I've never read a Lavender like that, probably because if I did I'd nope out of there after reading that paragraph :P

My favorite Lavender Brown story is [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=322079][A Lightness]]; it's an amazing short story whirlwind through her Hogwarts years, a really sensible take on her, too. I've also got a short oneshot [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=314682][730 Whispers]] that defines my headcanon for her.

** Most anything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/940359/jbern][jbern]] involves nonstandard interpretation of characters. In particular, essentially every character in his story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2686464/1/To-Fight-The-Coming-Darkness][To Fight the Coming Darkness]] is a reimagining of canon. The Sorting Hat in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]] is another notable character.

*** The Sorting Hat in The Lie I've Lived is one of my all time favorite characters. Not sure if there is a "standard" portrayal of the sorting hat tho... Unless 'sits on a shelf writing songs' is a portrayal.

**** Personally, I like the version of the Weasley Twins in that fic. Their standard fanon portrayal is Benevolent Trickster Gods, so it was refreshing to see a version that emphasized their more negative canon traits.

** Very dark Lupin (and Snape) in [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/105062?view_adult=true][Traitors and Allies]], completely different from the usual characterization of Lupin and yet just on the side of believable, and oh so strangely compelling.

** [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600021832][This certainly isn't Luna the seer]]. Luna is a /far/ different character, with a different and understandable background.

Be warned, this is an NC-17 fic with some serious BDSM content that may disturb you. There are some serious rape overtones as well.

If you don't mind the above, it's a really great fic, though sadly unfinished.

** The main character is an OC. But his interactions with the original characters shows how different they are. Harry comes off like Ron usually does.
