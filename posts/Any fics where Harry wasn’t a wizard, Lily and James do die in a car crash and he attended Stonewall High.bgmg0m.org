** Harry's a wizard in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12424344/chapters/28275021][Grey Space]], but he attended Stonewall High for 3 years because Hogwarts Education started at 14. It's sweet and not (really) depressing; he skip a year at Stonewall High, found a new friend, and his life at the Dursleys improved as he's practically ignored there. I really hope the Author create a sequel, it will be a really interesting indy!Harry.

#+begin_quote
  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.

** Well... it might exist as a one-shot more or less funny (or depressing) AU but... it wouldn't really be Harry Potter without the magic? What would be the story?

Still I'm interested at what people will find.

*** It might not be depressing, though. Harry goes to a new school without Dudley, he seemed quite excited about it.

It's just something I was curious about though.

** There was one fic I read a while back. I can't remember the name though. In the fic, the magic world couldn't find him until 4th year when his name was called out of the Goblet of Fire. Harry decided to represent Stonewall High in the Tournament (since that was where he went before Hogwarts).
