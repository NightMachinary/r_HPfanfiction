Post-war or during HBP, doesn't matter so long as they don't get back together. Gen or romance is okay. No slash or H/Hr.

Thanks in advance!


** Novocaine is one that was recently published and is updating regularly. The break-up was kind of rushed, but there's no hard feelings. Set post-DH.

** There was an HP/DG fiveshot fic that had Harry and Ginny being friendly. They had a daughter together, but grew apart. The fic by itself is quite lacklustre as there's really nothing particularly interesting about anyone's lives in the fic - they all felt boring and bland to me.

*** I'm pretty sure you're referring to Linkffn(Playing Defense by MuggleBeene).

Then yeah. It's pretty laclustre/bland/boring but I think that was kind of the point? Maybe? Just a slice-of-life with a Harry that's content with life.

  Athena Potter, daughter of Harry and Ginny, wants nothing more than her parents to be happy. With Ginny marrying Oliver Wood, her father needs a date. Luckily for her Teddy Lupin is glad to help. Now to find the impossible; a date for her father, Professor Potter. An EWE story, not part of the Professor Muggle series.

** A lot of Drarry fics feature an amicable relationship between the two. But that's slash so I can't help you...
