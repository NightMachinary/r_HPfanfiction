** I know only one: linkffn(The Videus Charm by OfPensandSwords), where fem!Harry learns how busk in the streets of Little Whinging to make some money for life necessities not provided by Dursleys (it is the fem!Harry story, so Dudley's clothes really don't work very well for her). But it is not the focal point of the story.

Generally, I am really disappointed how little music there is in the HP universe. And I don't mean silly songfics, but their incorporation in the normal world. When I remember my teenage years (yes, it is many years ago) music was absolutely essential part of it. So, it is sad how little music there is at Hogwarts.

One of few good exceptions to this is linkffn(3912184;4236594) (also, really great Daphne Greengrass story as you have never read it) and linkao3(Raindrops on Roses by backinyourbox), where the main hero ends up as a professional musician.

  Beginning immediately after the Epilogue, this story follows Scorpius, Rose and Albus through their Hogwarts years and beyond. Childish fears and desires soon turn to more serious dilemmas as some members of the Ravenclaw trio are forced to grow up too soon. Albus wants to be remembered for being something other than Harry Potter's son. Scorpius knows his father expects him to follow in his footsteps, but how long can he keep his friends, his music and his OWL in Muggle Studies a secret? And Rose has yet to decide what she wants...

  Some may consider him useless, but Ludo Bagman has been absolutely inspired by muggle sports channels. As a result, a camera charm has been created. It is ready to catch all the action of the Triwizard Tournament and broadcast it into every home over Wizarding Europe. Now Harriet is on the big screen, and the crowd is going to see a lot more than they bargained for. FEM/Harry.

*** I forgot one more, which is explicitly music related: linkao3(2146464). It is not anything important, just a little sweet story, but worthy of reading.

  “I can't tell anyone”, he repeated over and over again.Hermione helplessly stroked his back a couple of times.“Then don't”, she said.He stared at her with a bewildered expression.“Don't say anything”, she repeated. “Just play. I will stay and listen, if you want me to.”This is a bit of an AU. I was always a bit disappointed by the almost complete lack of music in the Harry Potter books. In my world, music is such an important thing... so I decided I would deviate from canon and make this a possible thing. I'm trying to stay as close to the original as possible though. It's mostly set in the sixth year and it's going to be pretty short. I'm planning on about 6 chapters total.
