I've seen a few with Neville as the BWL, and of course there are the 'brother is BWL' fics, but I have only ever seen one where a non-Harry/Neville/unnamed brother is the Chosen One. It was a dimension-travel fic where Katie was the GWL, and I lost it too. So why aren't there more of these fics, and what is the fic I lost?


** I don't know what the fic is, but I think the quick answer is *the Prophecy*. Harry and Neville are the most likely candidates. Anyone else will more than likely require creating an entirely new character, creating an entirely new prophecy, and considering the ramifications of that on the world.

This is not something most authors want to really get into, at least from what I have seen. So normally, if Harry is not BWL/GWL in a story Neville is the child of prophecy, there is no prophecy, or Voldemort was not...well.../Voldemort/.

  AU. On that night, Neville Longbottom was the child that You-Know-Who marked as his equal. Surprisingly, Longbottom lived through He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's Killing curse. Fourteen years later, the Boy-Who-Lived and Harry confront their destinies.
