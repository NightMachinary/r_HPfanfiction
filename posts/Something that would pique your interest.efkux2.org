I had this idea the other day and I've started to write it, but I'd like some feedback: originally I was planning on writing it as an original content novel, but lately I've been getting back into HP fic so I was considering adapting it to the HP world.

Would you read a fic where the main character is not immediately identifiable as someone you know? The idea is that over the course of the narrative (mystery/suspense/action), it becomes more clear that this character is someone important, who has history with the past drama that led to this point. In the context of the HP world, this would of course be the second wizarding war.

I know that's not a lot to go off of; I'm being cagey with details to preserve the vibe of the story, but also I'm at work right now so I haven't completely fleshed it out yet. TIA!


** Does sound like a good read if it is well written, but it could also be the opposite if written badly

So go ahead and I'll read the good fic when you're done

** I would have the main character interact with (identified or easy recognisable) side characters from canon early on tbh, but not reveal the main character's connection to them until later (i.e. the main character shops at George's shop, or takes the Knight Bus, or gets a drink with Blaide Zabini).

** Love it!!!

Honestly we need more focus that are not Harry based, or have a similar idea like yours, Harry with a different name from birth, or an identification number.

** I'd be open to it, but really, whether I would read it is based on my tastes for stories in general. Also, to be clear, would this be a story set at Hogwarts or not?

*** Oh, of course. I definitely don't expect anyone to read it if it's not to their taste! I'm going to take it in the mystery/action direction, with the main character being drawn back into their old life after they've tried to escape it. It was born mostly out of my desire to write a pseudo-noir with an exploration of the wider magical world, haha.

It will take place about 10 years after canon, following a character in Harry's year, so Hogwarts will not be a star setting.

** That's a bit vague. Is the story set before, during or after the books? OCs or canon characters?

*** That's fair. I'm being very vague since, frankly, I don't have a lot of it detailed right now - just the concept and general direction.

Canon characters, but since a lot of characters are very two-dimensionally written in the books it would be my take on them. And without spoiling who I believe it would be at this undeveloped point in time, not very prominently featured characters, although Harry and co. will eventually make an appearance. It will take place about ten years after the books, so Harry would be about 27/28.

** For some reason, I'm reminded of Kingdom Hearts II, with the intro covering Roxas, the strange turns in his life, and the eventual reveal that he's Sora's Nobody.

I think that in a fic where the main character isn't immediately identifiable, it might be better to introduce the 'mystery character' a little way into the fic, after introducing the original and whatever key elements are in the fic's universe so that your readers have a good idea of what to look for.\\
You know, introduce Harry Potter as a character and have him show off a bit before he disappears and 'Gaul Callahan' is introduced to the plot.
