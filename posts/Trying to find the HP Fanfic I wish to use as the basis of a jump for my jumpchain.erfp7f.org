Thinking of one where Dumbledore is evil but suffers from the lack of common sense most wizards in the series does. He has stolen much from the Potters but it is all rather easily retrieved. I do believe this was either a Time Travel fic or that Harry managed to gain information from the soul fragment in his scar fic.


** tbh you're gonna need more than that, that sounds like the beginning of any independent/ fix it harry fics

** Okay umm Dumbledore is at best only slightly evil/immoral. Still Incompetent. He at most has a single horcux that would be his portrait. (This bit may or may not be part of the story) I honestly don't need an exact story just one that would let me retrieve the Invisibility cloak easily as Dumbles in the jump will not give it up due to me taking the Master of Death scenario.
