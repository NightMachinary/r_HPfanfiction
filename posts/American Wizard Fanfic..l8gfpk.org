So I created this fan written story in a Expanded Universe of Harry Potter. It is called the American Wizard and it takes place between OOTP and DHPt2. This story is about an ex MUSCA Soldier that was apart of the American Version of Dumbledore's army and him building up the same company he had during the American War. The majority of the characters are all original until the England scenes and I try my best giving my own take on what happen in America during the years between the end of the first Wizarding war and OOTP. This is a dark take and there would be scenes that might haunt you.

Here is the first chapter. Please comment on these stories and give me feed back.
