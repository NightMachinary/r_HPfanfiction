I love Dark Harry Stories - but I hate that most of them just turn the tables and make Dumbledore, the Weasleys and most of the time Hermione suddenly the bad guys and are apologising the actions of the Death Eaters. Death Eaters are literally the magical equivalent of the Nazis, I don't want them to get apologised. There are very few Dark Harry Stories I really can enjoy because of that. For example I really loved [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][Sum of their Parts]] (exept for the abrupt ending).

Are there any other stories that make Harry believable Dark/ a believable Dark Lord without throwing all of his character (and the character of every other one) away?

  Canon Divergence from HBP. When Harry fails to save Ron's life in Slughorn's office, he and Hermione are thrust into a search for answers. But the path is thornier than either of them could have possibly imagined.

*** Thx. I know that one. The idea is good but I don't like the authors style. Can't pinpoint what exactly it is (it's not badly written!) but I never got into his storys - nether that one nor the Downward Spiral Saga.
