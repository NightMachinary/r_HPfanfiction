Are there any adventure stories where Dumbledore just says "screw it" in the middle of the school year (or during the summer whatever) and just heads off to a resort to relax? Maybe he gets in some drunken hijinks, causes some trouble, gets arrested, etc.,.

  Harry was feeling pretty good after his third year. True, it hasn't been going perfectly, but nothing ever does. Still, his godfather was free-ish and alive, and both their souls were where they belong. And then he got a visit from his mother's mother. There's no ownership by me involved with this.
