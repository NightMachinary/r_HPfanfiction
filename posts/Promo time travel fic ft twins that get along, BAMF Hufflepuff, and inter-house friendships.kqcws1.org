Hi! This is my first fic and this community has really helped me a lot, both in terms of recommendations and broadening my horizons. I've learned a lot from you guys, and I've tried to apply that learning in my work. I'd be much obliged if you'd read it and let me know what you think!

I know fem!Harry isn't exactly the most popular trope, but as a girl I have no idea how to write from a male perspective since acting adorable and other looks-based manipulation is a pretty big thing in my fic. I can assure you that there won't be any romance until fourth year - I'm on the asexual spectrum so physical romance is icky for me to write anyways. Instead, I focus on friendship and family, because I really wish Harry had had non-Gryffindor (or even just more than 2 close) friends.

I've only posted around 36k words so far but I have a fairly quick update schedule (1 week max, once every few days if I get impatient) - I have 125k words on my laptop, so my updates are going to be consistent for the next few months or so.

** Thanks for writing! Good people like you keep this community going strong, and I really appreciate it.

I've added your fic to my list, so I'll get to it as soon as I abandon whatever garbage I'm currently reading. I wish there was more fem!Harry, tbh, so I'm pretty stoked. I even did a super long post a while back about what I think the best names for fem!Harry are.

Thanks again!

** ok, I read and enjoyed the 11chapters that make up year1...

for myself I hope that Voldemort does not actually end up doing anything surprising, as I enjoy it more when he is semi incompetent and a predictable challenge. (rather than 'surprise! everything goes to hell'-type scenario)

I would prefer for the challenge coming from entrenched beliefs of Dark Magic is /baad'/, which seems to exist... and even that not becoming a main focus.

--------------

but even if you end up writing something that makes me drop it, I still appreciated and enjoyed what I've read so far.
