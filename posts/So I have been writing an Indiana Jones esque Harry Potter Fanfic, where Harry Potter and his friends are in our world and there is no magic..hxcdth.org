I just want to know if it is a good story or not.

You can check it out on my profile or through this link

** Read a couple of chaps. Yout OCs are okay, I can see them working with the premise. And the vase hitting things is the kind of muggle action for a story like this.

However, you do need some work. Dialogue is not bad if you look at it line by line, but it kind of feels forced and rushed in the context. You hurry the plot to much. Like in need these bunch of people to just do what I tell them without reacting in any way or saying anything, okay, they do it. In like 3 words. Chaps are small so you can really improve this by putting more meat around this. Focus a bit more in characters not just the plot.

Characters are not OOC so far, in the 2 chaps I read , but that is because you haven't really showed much of any of them aside from your OCs.

You can do well with some environment descriptions.

You can do well clearing if they can use magic or not. The reparo thing confused me.

Everyone seems too informed and accepting of everything so far. And at some point you made your OC ask like 5 questions in a go to get to exposition. Show, not tell, that's a good one.

You can do well looking for the correct spelling for Lucius as well.

*** Ok, thanks.

I do understand how it feels rush in the beginning, I was rereading a while ago. The thing with the magic is that it is draining out of them, the bigger the spell. I have been trying to move away from more of a script feel to a storytelling feel. That is why there is not as many reactions. I will start trying to use the show don't tell, but I understand how it feels force with the exposition. Also with rushing the plot a bit, the issue I am facing is showing when time has passed. The chapter with the introduction of Voldemort has this and the chapter I am writing have this as well. If it is possible if you can give me advice on how to pass time in a story, it is very appreciative. The other characters, like the Weasleys and the girlfriend, I am planning to do something with them. I don't know if you read the last chapter so far, but there is someone, that Donny finds and he asked the Weasleys if they can look after her. I am also planning to introduce the father of Donny. I was thinking that he is the only person who knows what is going on and everybody thought he was crazy. This is only an idea though, so let me know if you like it. Also if you notice, in the later chapters, I used the correct spellings for Lucius, so in the chapters that I didn't, I will have to change it to the correct spelling.

​

Thank you for your feedback and I hope you enjoy the rest of the story.

**** "The thing with the magic is that it is draining out of them"

YOu don't explain this in the first chaps and Hermione seems to know it already. It would be better for Hermione and co to find this out, and not to "just know it".

"If it is possible if you can give me advice on how to pass time in a story, it is very appreciative. "

​

Like how much time? What passes in that meantime? WHere are the characters at?

​

" I don't know if you read the last chapter so far, but there is someone, that Donny finds and he asked the Weasleys if they can look after her."

​

Big advice here, but story changing. Take it or leave it. DO you really need ALL of the Weasleys? Story economy. If they are just along for the ride and they are not doing anything, why are they here? The story could work just with the trio. If you really need them to babysit someone... wouldn't a single Weasley (Molly/Ginny) be enough?

***** It is somewhat explained through the first two chapters, the bit where Donny mentions that there is no such thing as magic. Meaning that for the magic to work, there has to be magical in the air for it two work.

​

When I mean time passing, I mean time passing in between in each setting. Like when the characters are in point an in part of the story, the point b in another part. Like a time jump, or if you are into film, like a jump cut.

​

I do agree with your third point and I regretted writing them in. In the beginning, there were going to be some jokes about how Arthur is amazed at all the muggle stuff and The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, but as the story progresses, I felt like that is not good for the story. And yes I do agree how a single Weasley will be enough. The problem for me, I don't know how to write them out. If I do write them out in the middle of the story, I feel like the audience will be confused. The problem with my writing is my brain works like a film. I always think of it continuity wise. Again I agree with the last paragraph you wrote, it just I don't know how to write them out. So what I am probably planning to do is to find a way to make them more involved in the story. This story is still in production, so there might be ways of getting the Weasley family involved.

****** Donny mentioning that there's no magic is not the best way to do that. Since he is an unreliable narrator in terms of magic. How does he know there's no magic? Is he ever knowing? In a expository fashion a knowledgeable wizard should have told them this info. In a show no tell, they should be capable of doing magic at the beginning and then it keeps getting weaker until it vanishes in some chap.

I know what you meant by time jump. Was asking about the specifics for the time jump you want to pull. It's not the same pulling a 5 min jump than a 5 years.

I guess best way would be rewriting story. But you might not want to go there. So, if you really don't need them, you could find a way to send them back through some portal... Or just stay behind in some muggle house and not take part in the action.

You could have pulled the Arthur stuff without Arthur there. Just with "My dad would totally freak out with this!"

******* Ok I understand, thank you. With the time jump, I was asking because in this upcoming chapter, The beginning is at the diner, then the next setting is near a forest. With the magic draining idea, I was trying to do a slow build of it, using Malfoy first, then the heroes, then the rest of the villains. But yeah, with having rest of the family staying behind in the muggle house and not take part in the action is a great idea. This can help with looking over the little girl.

Thanks for the advice.

******** So. If its a short time in comparison to the story and not much happens before it. You can just jump into it. Like, your story details a lot of what happened one eventful day, but then you want to skip a few hours, you can do something like:

"Okay, see you then" (this is in the morning)

That afternoon they drove into the Gangster-Pirate Cave... (This is later )

As you can see you dice right into it. Maybe you can put an extra line break to separate scenes.

If it is a bit longer, like days later you can start the paragraph with "The following days were not very eventful..." Or "Next Thursday..." Or "Two weeks later .."

In bigger time jumps other tactics are used. Especially if there are things that happen during the jump
