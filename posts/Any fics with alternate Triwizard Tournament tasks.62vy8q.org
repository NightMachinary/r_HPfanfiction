I'm looking for fics that have COMPLETELY different tasks then those in canon. Fun and imaginative tasks. I read a fic once where the tasks were a duel, a Scavenger Hunt, and another maze... all boring. Harry doesn't have to be the main character, and it doesn't have to be about just the Triwizard Tournament.

Any ideas? I can read it as long as it has no harems and no bashing. Also, good grammar, please for the love of god.

Also, don't recommend linkffn(The Lie I've Lived by jbern) I've tried it.


** linkffn(6517567)

This fic has a broom race through a canyon, multiple sets of duels, including a wandless one, a potion brewing task and hide and seek kind of event.

It's a Harry/Hermione time loop fic, in case that isn't your bag.

The Accidental Animagus also has some interesting tasks. linkffn(9863146)

#+begin_quote
  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

  COMPLETE LV/HP: Raised in a Muggle orphanage, Harry arrives at Hogwarts a bitter boy. Unusually intelligent, he's recruited by the Unspeakables and the Death Eaters at a young age. As he grows older, he constantly has to struggle to keep his footing around a manipulative and bored Dark Lord, who fancies mind games and intellectual entertainment.

** In my story "Patron", the tournament has four tasks - all with an elemental theme. Between the tasks are competitions for those students who were not chosen as champions - a duelling tournament, a Curse-Breaker competition and a Quidditch competition. All tasks are (or should be) as safe as a professional Quidditch match, and held in magical arenas, with spells allowing the spectators to follow the action easily.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
