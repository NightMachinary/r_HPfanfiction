** The Phoenix and the Serpent. In its category probably one of the best stories of all time, period.

** Harry Potter and the Society of Orpheus and Bacchus, for well-written, luxurious fun. Sadly, it never finished. Written by A.L. de Sauveterre.

Interwoven, or The Seamstress and the Lovable Stray, by Katinka. Super sweet Sirius/OFC with some nice worldbuilding.

The top prize though does have to go to After the End, by Arabella and Zsenya. Sheer gold on every level, including redemption arcs, love stories, magical innovation, and wonderfully in-character characters. The only thing I can say against it is, there's no Luna Lovegood (and that's no fault of A&Z's).
