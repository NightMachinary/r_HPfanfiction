I'm looking for interesting stories with the Harry/Ginny pairing. Preferably ones with adventure and other plots, not just pure fluff. It doesn't have to be the main focus but it should be there. I've already read Backwards with Purpose. Soul Bond fics are fine as they are a guilty pleasure but I think I've probably read all the good ones by now.


** I cannot recommend enough Jeconais's hysterical [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/This_Means_War][This Means War]]. While not a soul bond, it's cute Ginny/Harry and is worth a read. My wife looked at me with great concern when I was laughing so hard I had tears streaming down my face.

** If you're looking for a fast-paced action/adventure romp, I would rec [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?action=printable&textsize=0&sid=12686&chapter=all][I Need a Hero]]. Ginny-centric story where she works as a vampire hunter. [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=12260&chapter=1&textsize=2][Curse Breakers: The Maya]] is similar, with Ginny as a curse-breaker, but somewhat slower paced.

If you want a true /epic/, with brilliant characterizations, action, wordbuilding, lore, mystery and romance, there is no better fic than [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/637123/1/The-Phoenix-and-the-Serpent][The Phoenix and the Serpent]]. It a /long/ story though, and only two of the three story arcs are complete.

If you want a dark, high adrenaline story, read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6256154/1/The-Unforgiving-Minute][The Unforgiving Minute]]. Time travel fic where Harry has to destroy all the horcruxes /and/ kill Voldemort, all in twelve hours. Ginny is just a subplot though.

If you want a good, regularly updated WiP story, try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11815544/1/The-Aurors][The Aurors]] by [[/u/FloreatCastellum]]. It is an auror!Harry story where he and his trainee have to fight against both the remnants of the Death Eaters and muggleborn extremists. Fun stuff.

If you want a brilliant coming-of-age drama without much action, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling]] is one of the best there is. Great writing and characterizations, but no romance yet. The author just announced on her [[https://twitter.com/annerbhp/status/720330604424732673][twitter]] that she finished the rough draft of the next chapter (98 pages!!!), so it should be up soon. /bites nails/.

** Since Bot is down again, I will just provide links to stories:

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/favorites/story.php?sort=title&categoryid=0&userid=0][Abraxas]]*: the Horcrux in Harry was sentient and it made a deal with Harry. As a result, Harry became really really powerful, and Voldemort was hardly his worst enemy. [[/spoiler][I like this story a lot because it doesn't paint Muggles in a positive light, as it is commonly done in the fandom]] My complaint though is that the last part of the story was too short.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6989327/1/Children-s-Crusade][Children's Crusade]]*: this fic is actually epilogue compliant. After finally rounding up the last Death Eaters, the Trio and Ginny were called by Hermione from a different dimension to defeat Voldemort one more time. The writing is great, and the story is very emotional.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4740107/1/Ginny-Returns][Ginny Returns]]*: Ginny lone time travel, had it easy with the bad guys, but ran into trouble with her own love life.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince]]* and *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]]*: best year 6 and year 7 fics from Ginny's POV, imho

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/Hail-Odysseus][Hail Odysseus]]*: another one from Brennus. Slytherin Harry/Ginny fought hard against Voldemort, [[/spoiler][only to be betrayed by the Weasleys and the Ministry.]]

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5270746/1/Harry-Potter-and-Godric-s-Legacy][Harry Potter and Godric's Legacy]]*: the story has a pretty good, if not more horrible, alternative to horcruxes. The story contains a few cliches, but is otherwise very good.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9104885/1/It-s-OK-Not-To-Be-OK-But-I-Promise-I-m-Trying][It's OK Not To Be OK Series]]*: I read it once through. Not the best stories in my opinion, but this 4-part series is kind entertaining.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]]*: extremely well written, canon compliant story of Harry and Ginny's work/life in year 2010.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6473434/1/Unspeakable-Things][Unspeakable Things]]*: Lockhart as DoM agent, trained Harry/Ginny as assassins/soldiers from early on, decent story if you exclude the epilogue. Very different characterization of Luna.

Finally, there is the *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4545504/1/Aspirations][Aspirations]]* by megamatt. The plot is pretty fun to read, but the fic contains too many grammar errors and typos, and I don't like its extreme Hermione bashing.

** The best romance fic in the fandom according to me is linkffn(Seeking Ginny). It has the single most emotional story climax of anything I've read, and I have read a lot. Features a PRE-HBP characterized Ginny, which is awesome.

** Well, if you have any patience, I have a Harry/Ginny epic ready to be released (after my new beta has corrected it). I posted a promotion thread on it a couple of days ago, but I took it down again becaues there were a little too many mistakes.

The premise is that Harry and Ginny are spotted in the company of Sirius black. Harry is outcast and the Wizarding World thinks Ginny is kidnapped. Takes place mainly outside of Hogwarts.

**** As I said to someone who PMed me and said "You're never updating BoTIII, are you?":

  Never say never. It has a horribly permanent meaning to it.

No plans at this moment in time. But that isn't to say I won't have something in the future. Everytime I look at the WIP chapter, the creative part of my brain shuts off. That's writer's block, lads and ladies. It is real. And it sucks.

** I'm quite fond of linkffn(The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond).

Not a normal soul bond fic. They actually hate each other's guts for the first portion of the story, but I found the back and forth dialogue one of the highlights of the fic. Still a WIP.
