I like fics where Harry is raised by someone other than the Dursleys and this having sweeping repercussions. So bonus points if the canon story line isn't followed. Crossovers are also totally fine. I'd prefer no "Harry's dad is actually BLANK" fics but adoptive parents are fine.

Please no pottercest, genderbending or romance driven plot. Slash and bashing are fine. Thank you!


** I liked linkffn(11617421), sadly it's not finished.

  When Harry was left on the Dursley's doorstep, Petunia quickly realised he couldn't stay. Where else to leave him but with the very person who'd first lured her sister into the magical world all those years ago? With a very different upbringing on Diagon Alley, it's not exactly the same Harry that arrives at Hogwarts ten years later.

**** It is, I rather liked it. Not the usual cliche story. No evil!Dumbledore or manipulative!Dumbledore as far as I remember, but Dumbledore is close to canon. No Ron- Hermione- or anyone-bashing. No Lord Potter-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Ravenclaw-Pevrell. No Super!Harry, but also no Sick!Harry.

I don't recall even a single character being much OOC, except Harry obviously isn't the same.

  A chance remark on the night of Halloween 1981 could have changed everything. Fate throws baby Harry into the custody of Kingsley Shacklebolt, assisted by a certain Mad-Eye Moody. And oh boy, heads will roll and history will change when this gets out. Dear Wizarding Britain: Your saviour has arrived.

**** I actually never finished Harry McGonagall or The Accidental Animagus so I don't know for sure. It seemed like they were different enough from canon. The Innocent series does get a little rehashy once Harry starts at Hogwarts but I think it's getting pretty different now in third year since several of the key bad-guy players are not where they were at this time in canon.

** In linkffn(The Wise One: Book One: Becoming by FarenMaddox) and its two sequels Harry is raised by Sirius while they travel abroad. There's a lot of OCs and plot elements outside of canon, even though some canon stations starting from Year 5 are actually followed in the 2nd and 3rd parts of the trilogy. It is generally very well written, but somewhat slow-paced. My greatest point of annoyance while reading it was Harry's canon-ish behaviour during the Umbridge debacle, despite his majorly different background.
