As it's around a year since Alan Rickman died +of a snakebite+, I thought it was a good idea to reread Snape Chronicles. The story chronicles his life, from his bird in a small Lancashire town to his death by the hands of Voldemort. It's really excellent and really long (my Kindle estimates it to be almost 42 hours long).

If you'd like to read it, you can find it at linkffn(Snape Chronicles)

Snape Chronicles isn't the full title so the bot probably couldn't find it

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.
