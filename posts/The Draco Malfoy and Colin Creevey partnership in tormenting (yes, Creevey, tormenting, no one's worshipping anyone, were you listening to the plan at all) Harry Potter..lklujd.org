It's annoying when people begin to mature, and Draco Malfoy is infuriated when Potter's reactions to his masterfully witty insults don't seem to get the same reaction as they used to. But Draco is nothing if not ambitious, and he begins to ponder alternative ways at getting under Potter's skin. Perhaps a new approach, or, better yet, a new perspective is what he needs to revitalize the hateful bond he and his nemesis share.

Now, if his new perspective could control his fawning and tears of joy around the subject of their tormenting, that would be grand.

/(Could not tell you how this popped into my head, but I think the idea of Draco recruiting the only other person at Hogwarts that well and truly irritates Harry to be his "partner-in-Potter-tormenting" is hilarious. Also their shared obsession with him of course.)/


** Oh my god.

“Harry Harry Harry, can I get a picture of you and my new friend Draco together to show my dad?”
