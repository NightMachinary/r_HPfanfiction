** Harry as Nagini felt Arthur's “ribs spinster between his jaws” so apparently the bite was somewhere on his torso. Snape was bitten in his neck. I can see how a neck wound might kill a person faster.

** Another possibility is that Arthur got help and treatment. Snape didn't.

** Snape was bit in the neck. You die way faster from a neck wound.

** I'd say because antidote... But we all know know you mean how he survived for so long. The answer is simple: Rowling is inconsistent.

** From how fast he died the bite probably hit a vein, and without help you ain't getting back up from that.

** Because JK Rowling didn't want the Weasleys to go through anymore heartbreak, while Snape was just an exposition piece who needed to die for the plot to continue. Imagine if the Golden Trio wasn't there though. Do you think Harry would still die somehow, or if they would kill Voldemort and he would return later?

** Well. There are several theories so TL:DR because J.K wrote it like that

The first is Snape accepted his Death, he knew he was going to die and he didn't fight Arthur fought the snake probably making it harder to hit important arteries.

The second is voldermort was in hiding theres a good chance that Voldemort didnt want arthur dead because that would. Bring more risk of him being discovered.

The third is. Nagini feels emotions from Voldemort(harry is a horcrux and he does) so. The need to kill Snape for Voldemort was stronger than arthur and nagini reacted accordingly
