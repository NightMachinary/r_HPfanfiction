Any stories where he's opposed to voldemort and has to be ruthless to achieve his goals


** Ruthlessness and "light" do not mix well. A ruthless Harry would not be above sacrificing the DA to grind down the Death Eaters in a war of attrition, but a "light" Harry wouldn't even approve of lethal force (like in canon). A ruthless Harry would also consider mobster tactics (abduct the Death Eater children, deliver Draco's head and a new threat to Voldemort), guerrilla warfare, blackmail, assassinations (and so on) as valid tools to get the job done. Nothing of that would fit the "light side" or even Harry's personality.

*** I think what OP seeks is a story where Harry doesn't spare Death Eater but at the same time will try to avoid deaths on his side as most as possible. He won't bargain and shit. For example if there are hostages he will plan to rescue them the best he can even if it kills all the DE but he will try to save all the hostages even if risking himself. I think it's possible but maybe it should be more qualified as grey Harry? Well light in a war situation is plain useless. Killing DE clearly is the best idea to be quick and efficient (some would argue that you can hide them in a secret prison under Fidelius or something but fighting while trying not to kill is just bothersome and asking to lose).

It doesn't even mean this, though it could. Someone can feel compassion, but put it aside for their goal.

Think of Thanos in the recent movie - he was most definitely a villain, but he had his own version of genuine feelings for Gamora. Didn't stop him from executing her to achieve his goals, even as he wept. What he was trying to achieve was more important to him than both a person he loved and his own feelings.

That's the sort of general attitude I'd expect a ruthless good guy Harry to have. He might /hate/ himself, but stopping Voldemort is too important.

*** You talk like there are only the extremes "never use deathly force" and "sacrifice all allies to kill the enemy". Harry could very well be ruthless in his dealings with DEs, killing them whenever he has the chance, maybe even sacrificing innocent bystanders if he can justify it (e.g. they would die anyways) and at the same time protect his friends and not sacrifice them. Or he could imperio some muggle generals and have conduct an air raid on Voldemorts hideout.

There are many ways Harry could be somewhat ruthless and thus more efficient without sacrificing his friends. And whether killing people who obviously plan to kill you is "light" or not can be defined by the author, since there is no canonical definition of "light".

I'm not sure why you keep insisting that a ruthless person would just go around single-mindedly killing people he doesn't like and everyone around them. Some degree of ruthlessness is a fairly common human trait.

******* ...

Let me correct you.

If you allow pity or compassion to get in the way of achieving your goals you are not ruthless.

Ruthless people in wars are more likely to kill than not-ruthless folks. Doesn't mean ruthless people will kill if it is more beneficial not to. While in wars generally killing your enemies is indeed beneficial, it doesn't mean a ruthless person has to be a raging murderhobo like hellstrike seemed to be suggesting.

Soldiers for example are trained to kill their enemies without hesitation or pity and thus be ruthless, once the enemy surrenders they are no longer allowed to kill him. A particularly ruthless soldier is very unlikely to kill someone who surrendered because it will have negative consequences for him (he will be punished).

Soldiers are also not allowed to shoot unless fired upon if there is potential for collateral damage. A ruthless soldier is very unlikely to fire into a civilian crowd just because one of them has a gun, because punishment form his own side is going to likely be worse than the threat posed by the gunman.

Would a ruthless Harry kill his enemies, if doing so would get him thrown into Azkaban? Only if the risks of leaving his enemies alive outweighed the risk and severity of punishment. Ruthlessness doesn't give you a compulsion to kill people. It doesn't make you a serial killer, nor evil (although 'evil' people tend to be ruthless).

******** You make a good point about ruthless people in public situations not wanting to look bad in front of others.

In pretty much every death eater war fic I've read Harry is almost always dueling a death eater one on one or stealthily infiltrating places away from public view. Why would he accept a surrendering death eater under such circumstances.

I cannot imagine a ruthless capable Harry not getting his hands bloodied.

But you are correct saying Hellstrike was taking it a little to far saying Ruthless Harry would intentionally sacrifice people for a better shot at killing DE's

#+end_quote

He wouldn't. Probably. Unless it's more useful to his goals to interrogate the death eater. Although interrogating a member of a terrorist organisation whose members seem to rely on anonymity is a very good idea.

My whole point is that being ruthless means you would be /willing/ to do whatever it takes. It is a very limited view to think that this only applies to killing.

Imagine there is a death eater that likes to rape muggles. He offers to make a unbreakable vow that if you let him leave the country he will owl you vital information that would allow you to win the war. He has also taken precautions against other forms of interrogation by some sort of a suicide switch (he knows that if you get the information and still had him in your power you would kill him, so he figures he might aswell deny you the info unless you let him go.).

If you let him go you would get an owl soon with said information, that would allow you to win the war and save many lives, but you also know that the death eater is now in a random country raping and killing (discreetly) and you probably can't find him. A ruthless person would prolly choose this.

Alternatively you being a goody two shoes, arrest him. Perhaps you will try to interrogate him and he kills himself, or you send him to prison. The war would go on and many of your friends and schoolmates would die, but the death eater in question couldn't hurt strangers anymore. Canon Harry.

But of course if killing people is what it takes to win, then a ruthless person would kill. I'm just trying to say that most fanfic authors don't actually understand killing all your enemies is rarely the best way to win a war. Especially the kind of war described in Harry Potter.

Giving leniency at the end of the first war was beneficial because while it allowed murderers and scum to get away with their crimes, it did stop the fighting and it did stop further deaths. Canon characters actually didn't have the capability to hunt down all the death eaters and kill them without major casualties on both sides. The likes of Lucius Malfoy im pretty sure they turned themselves in after they knew that they could get away with the imperius plea. If they had not had those assurances they would have fought to the end in the hopes of winning even without Voldemort and these kinds of last stands are always bloody, especially since they would have kept to the hit and run tactics instead of an actual last stand.

Of course if an author makes his Harry so OP that he could extermnate the death eaters without excess damage to his own side then of course it stops making sense to just send them back to Voldemort with a few bruises, but keep in mind that if one side escalates so does the other, and Voldemort was in fact holding back, because he didn't want to rule over ashes.

Not killing your enemies can require far more ruthlessness from the person in charge because they decide that their goals are better achieved by allowing murderers, rapist and other scum to escape justice and possibly keep doing horrible things.

Of course in Canon, Harry was a goody two shoes and was merciful to a death eater in the coffee shop who later went on to kill Remus Lupin and probably other nameless characters. I think the belief that killing DE-s is always best idea comes from that, but people don't realise that the DE-s would escalate even further and unless you have plot armor you probably wouldn't actually succeed in killing enough of them before they can retaliate against your family/friends/acquintances.

And i just noticed that i seem to have written an essay :O

#+end_quote

He would be very likely to get his hands bloody indeed. Especially since being the BWL hes in the middle of the fight. It's not a requirement tho.

Edit. Ruthlessness can come in many actions. Not all of them obvious to others. It's an informed decision to do something immoral for what you think is best for you or your country or whatever it is you care about.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.
