I need to feel some real terror from the characters, or as a reader, or both!

The only idea that comes to mind is emphasizing that Voldemort really is the DARK Lord. He's powerful, yes, but wizards are too terrified of him to even say his name! Yes, he's done some nasty things, but where do we get that sense of terror?

Canon has certain moments that are terrifying when you think about them (Hermione tortured by Bellatrix, dementors used as prison guards), but I don't come across that or anything more overt than that in much fanfiction, though the treatment of dementors in Methods of Rationality and Following the Phoenix definitely falls in this category.

Any recommendations? What scared you?


** Well, if you want to feel terror as a reader, there's always “My Immortal”.

But such silliness aside, I heard that “Elizium for the Sleepless Souls” (linkffn(7713063) is good in that regard. I can't confirm it because it's still on my to-read list (I'm not one for horror stories so I just put it there instead for the time being because there were other things I'd been reading at the time), but the reviews on forums seem to be fairly positive so you might want to give it a try.

  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.

  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.

** A lot of nice ones that have been linked here, but I've found that long format fics tend to ease up on the horror of things to allow for there to be an actual plot. I've found some very good short ones, but they're much more difficult to search for among my favorites.

One that I *really* loved, however is the following: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7864670/1/Mandragora]])
