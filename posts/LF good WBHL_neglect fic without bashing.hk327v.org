I really like reading about the family conflict that's always present in WBHL/neglect fics. Unfortunately, many of the stories based on this are full of bashing and just general bad writing, so I'm always a bit reluctant to start a new one.

I'm hoping for a relatively long fic where Harry's parents and Dumbledore are not objectively evil. I'm fine with them being unlikable, just you know, not full on bashing. Now I realize this is a bit difficult to do, but I'm willing to suspend disbelief on the events that led to the neglect. Maybe Lilly and James had their hands full with one child and war restoration efforts, maybe Dumbledore had some convoluted plan that resulted in Harry getting less attention than a child needs, maybe [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt][someone cast a mind spell]], I really don't care. I just want to read about a somewhat bitter child in conflict with somewhat regretful parents.

I'd prefer the fic to avoid the Ancient and Noble houses trope since all the the fics I've read recently were over-saturated with it. I'd also like the fic to have no parings. These are not requirements, so if you think the story is really good please link it (I'm fine with slash).

I've read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12021325/1/Antithesis][Antithesis]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/136/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][HP and the Prince of Slytherin]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die][Too Young to Die]] and the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][Saving Connor Saga]] (though not all of it, mostly because of Dumbledore and Lily)


** Three Black Birds was a kind of interesting example. Bit of a Cliche Misanthropic Haphne fic, but the actual relationship between Harry and his disinterested parents develops quite nicely.

** If you liked Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin, then you'd probably enjoy [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13507192/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Ashes-of-Chaos][Harry Potter and The Ashes of Chaos]] too.

Its pretty new so it doesn't have that much chapters overall, but the author does release a new chapter every week, so you won't have to wait long for new chapters.

  Fourth year. Living with the Dursleys taught Harry three all important rules. These rules cause an emotionally repressed 11 year old to attend Hogwarts and discover his so called dead family aren't as dead as he believed.

  When the car went careening off the bridge it did more than send the sisters into the river. It sent them into an ocean a whole world away. Now, armed with future knowledge and a few new friends, they set out on a quest to reunite their family, and maybe take down a few dragons along the way.

  A prophecy left unfulfilled, a family torn apart by repercussions of war and one child left to a life of neglect. But there were those not content to allow this to pass. Harry Potter may have been abandoned at the end of the war but he will rise to be more than any could have imagined. Minimal bashing, rated M for violence etc. Harry/Tonks, James/Lily Main plot begins GOF
