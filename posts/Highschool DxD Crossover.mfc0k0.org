I'm looking for a fic I read a few years ago. All I remember is Harry telling I think it was Greyfia to send a message, that he was Ophis's equal and opposite


** might it be Linkffn(Filfy teacher) ?

Werewolf Harry got divorced after the war and got away from Britain with his only daughter, Lily.

  A Harry Potter who has tried to take control of his destiny from second year on finds himself in need of a fresh start due to his marital status changing abruptly. Armed with some abilities beyond the norm, a Mastery of Defense and a muggle-style teacher's license, Harry takes his daughter Lily Luna and takes a job offer at Kuoh Academy. Pairings undecided save Harry/Rias/many?
