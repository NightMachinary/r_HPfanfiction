  It would make things more nuanced for starters. Nobody could just point a finger so easily at a color and group people together. We really would have to look at the characters actions and ideology that they display.

  It actual takes a lot away from the other houses, by outsourcing the 'bad people' in one house. We don't get to see how Hufflepuff's loyalty made them loyal to the wrong kind of people. We don't gt to see a Ravenclaw that in his or her search for knowledge became so ruthless that they didn't care how they got it. We didn't see a Gryffindor fight bravely and recklessly for Voldemort and his ideals (and Peter doesn't count here, because when he is with Voldemort he imbodies everything Gryffindor is not).

These are the same point. There's no reason we need to remove Slytherin to do this. Any house that a Dark Lord comes from will be tainted as long as that Dark Lord is in living memory.

  Slyhterin is missing a primary action attribute compared to the other houses. Ambition and cunning are more secondary attributes. Let me explain, you confront different people with a problem or the wish to succeed. How would the typical Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff go at that? The Gryffindor would start to work on the problem and try to solve it directly. If something isn'T working they are changing it at the go. They are ready to take risks for it and to put themselves in harms way if necessary. Ravenclaws would do their research first. They would try to think up every possible scenario and how to react to it. They don't want to be surprised. Hufflepuff have more of a group thing going for them. They would discuss and then veto how to deal with thins and would do it together, having each others back. They are the meting pot at the school were everybody has the same voice among them, they have to relay on democracy a lot more than the other houses. And Slytherin is missing this kind of first action trait.
#+end_quote

Cunning is a primary trait, though. Got a problem? Manipulate someone else into solving it for you. Slytherin Harry goes after the Sorcerer's Stone and tricks Hermione and Ron into solving the puzzles for him. Slytherin Harry gets someone else to interrogate Malfoy and report back. Slytherin Harry doesn't need to go back in time to save Sirius because he played to Snape's vindictive nature and convinced the man that it might be amusing the hear the frenzied ramblings of a madman just before his execution. Cunning is essentially applied cleverness. And trust me, ambition can be a primary trait. I would argue it's Percy Weasley's primary trait through most of the books. The issue with the books isn't that cunning and ambition aren't primary traits. It's that JKR didn't show them at all.

  The prominent Slytherin characters all would from the way they act fit quiet well in other houses. Slughorn is someone that thinks about connecting people and this interpersonal relationships are his thing. That sounds like a Hufflepuff. Draco, Crabbe and Goyle are into this group mentality as well. They seek strength in numbers and having each others back (for most of the series) they are loyal to Voldemort, because their parents were loyal to him as well. Snape is a kid that search for new knowledge as we see with his potion book and his dark curses- that sounds like Ravenclaw. Voldemore himself acts like a Ravenclaw as well. Then you have people like Bellatrix and Crouch Jr. who are very direct and aggressive or brave and reckless in their fight for Voldemort and his ideals, like a Gryffindor.

"You know, I sometimes think we sort too soon!" -- Dumbledore. The traits that put someone in a house are not the only traits we ever see. Hermione is clever, Ron is loyal, Harry is cunning, Percy and the twins are ambitious, Cho is loyal, Draco is hard working, Luna is brave. We could just as easily remove one of the other houses.

Removing Slytherin doesn't automatically make the story better. Humanizing the Slytherins and rounding out their characters would.

*** But the character traits we are first given are like you read a symptom list for a psychopath. The books started with making one house evil and I just think it would work better without it, especially because you round up everything else with the other three houses.

And cunning is not cleverness. It works best when you are both cunning and clever, but it is not the same. Cleverness is a Ravenclaw thing and if you claim cunning just as a part of cleverness that is just a point for my theory, because than it would something that was taken from Ravenclaw to make them a full rounded house with good and bad sides

**** Cunning is applied cleverness. It's not just a subset, the application actually makes it different. Cleverness is the ability to work out a puzzle, solve a riddle. Cunning is the ability to manipulate people (which isn't always a bad thing), so actually take the the abstract and use it in real life. For instance, in poker: Cleverness would allow a person to work out the possible hands they might get based off what they have and the likelihood of each, and whether or not they'll have to bluff. Cunning would allow a person to use just the right movements and tone of voice that they can manipulate their opponent into folding or increasing the pot or whatever they need.

I'm a bit confused as how you think cunning and ambition are traits for psychopaths. You may as well say that bravery and nobility are traits of idiots, or that loyalty and hard work are traits of the dull. Yes, the books started making one house evil, but that's not the house's fault. That's on JKR entirely. It doesn't help that the first wizard we meet is biased against Slytherin, the first Slytherin we meet is a snobbish little kid, the Gryffindors who tell us about Slytherin are biased against it, the head of Slytherin is a petty man who can't let go of a grudge. If we're judging a house by the way it's set up at the start, why does Hufflepuff get a pass? They may as well not exist in book 1 and in book 2 they universally hate Harry. Book 3 they're conspicuously absent again, and book 4 they again hate Harry. Yet somehow they're okay?

I'm not going to say that Slytherin is all a bunch of woobies who were mis-characterized and should be loved and cherished. There were some really bad eggs there. But the house itself isn't the problem, and removing it isn't the answer. Curse Rowling for being a mediocre author (which she really is...her worldbuilding is crap and so many characters never get any real characterization) but don't blame Slytherin for existing.

**** I don't see how you can say that being "ambitious and cunning" is a symptom list for a psychopath. Just like everything else you said in your first post someone can be ambitious in terrible ways, but if someone decided they wanted to cure all forms of cancer that'd be pretty damn ambitious, and a good thing.

I googled "cunning" and it says "having or showing skill in achieving one's ends by deceit or evasion", which is exactly what the post above you is arguing. If you want to say this is just some kind of intelligence applied (which it is), we can basically say that all of the qualities of the 4 houses are either emotional intelligence (Gryfs and Puffs) or rational intelligence applied (Claws vs Snakes), so we should only have 2 houses.

Don't do this shit. Not only is it incredibly aggravating to read, but it's a self-fulfilling prophecy, because a lot of people (myself included) automatically downvote anything like this. You aren't martyring yourself over internet points.

As for the topic, there's nothing wrong with House Slytherin as a concept (aside from pigeon-holing kids for 7 years because of one trait, but that's the entire house system being garbage). Rowling just pulled it off badly, to the point where it's basically the house of evuuuuls. Executionally flawed, not conceptually. No need to nuke Slytherin from orbit when you can just write it better.

*** I think the important thing to keep in mind is that the House System isn't something explicitly invented for Harry Potter, but something that actually exists in British boarding schools to organize kids for classes and give younger kids access to older kids for membership.

** The fact that Slytherin isn't executed well doesn't mean we should take them out. If we were going by that rational, we should take away every house, since none of them serve any purpose anyway (besides being way to communicate to a small child what each house is).

Hufflepuff? The loser house. Sure Cedric was from this house, but would his death have been any different if he had just been a random 7th year (since we've taken out houses entirely in this scenario). The fact that he only becomes important in fourth year when the series started to get more YA is important. Can't have someone from the loser house doing cool stuff, that's Gryffindors thing. Hopefully by the time you read this book you realize that not everyone is a cardboard cut out (he isn't even particularly loyal either, Harry straight up tells him that they have to fight Dragons, and Cedric tells Harry "hmmm try taking a bath" instead of telling him to stick the egg in water).

Ravenclaw? The nerd house. There's a reason people thought Hermione should have been a Ravenclaw in the first books, it's pretty easy to just say she's the school nerd. Luna's from this house, I guess, but she doesn't show any particular desire to learn things save for being willing to test/believe anything. Cho is from here as well, but I don't remember her ever having a moment of particular wit or desire for learning. The fact that at no point do Harry and Co. say "we need someone smart, let's get a Ravenclaw" also shows how useless this division is.

Slytherin? The evil/bully house. They only exist to make Harry hate Voldemort (since he was a Slytherin) even more, contrast the two, and to give Harry an "enemy" during the school year. I've already said that the house in concept isn't well executed no one does anything remotely cunning or is even really ambitious in the books. Draco's 6th year plan was cunning I guess, maybe even ambitious (though he really didn't want to do it), but are you honestly going to tell me that you think that Crabbe/Goyle are in any way ambitious OR cunning?

Gryffindor? The cool house. You should like Harry and want to be him even more because he's in the cool house with the lion. That's what Gryffindor is for. If Harry and Ron had just happened to get be roommates, and had a class schedule that overlapped with Hermione's most of the time, the fact that they're Gryffindors could be completely removed and their relationship would probably have developed the same way. No one in Gryffindor is important SOLELY because they are brave (some people like Percy and Peter are important because they aren't, Percy not being able to forgive his family for being right, and Peter for being a coward).

So to finish, I guess the story could be better if you took out Slytherin since it was so poorly done, though all houses were poorly done but it could be even better if you just took away the houses and had all these kids going to a school without houses. Of course that doesn't tell the dumb 7 year old me which kid he has to hate, which is why Slytherin is the bad house, not because the characteristics Slytherin supposedly embodies are evil/not enough to be the primary characteristics of a character.

** Removing the snakes doesn't make the story a better one. Fleshing out the House system and demonstrate why the students were placed in the respective houses would. And let's be honest, while Draco was a git for the entire series, he definitely made HBP more interesting.

** I agree with the basic premise of this post. Slyterhin and how it has been handled is one of the bigger failures of the Series.

I'm not entirely sure that Slytherin has to be removed entirely, but it would have to be transformed so substantially that there'd be merit in saying "You just removed Slytherin and added an entirely different House with the same name". Certainly it wouldn't be allowed to contain all the bad people.

The thoughts about primary/secondary attributes are interesting. I think "ambition" is a pretty bad action trait, because all high-achievers in all houses should have it. But cunning works pretty well I think and is a very different approach to those described to be typical for Gryffindor, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff. A different Slytherin (that doesn't revolve around being evil) would be styled around cunning/intelligence&information gathering/stealth. I think that's a markedly different approach than what the other Houses would do.

#+begin_quote
  You could still have the chamber of secrets and all that, but as a kind of lost house thing. That the other three founders kind of sorted Slytherin's students between them after he left and the house was closed down after that. Imagine in the second book the hunt for that lost house first in the books and actual trying to find clues about what kind of guy Slytherin was, why the he left in the first place and all that. Not just in a little story time, but because the trio worked for that kind of things.
#+end_quote

I don't think removing Slytherin should lead to having a plot revolving around rediscovering Slytherin. Sounds like a bad idea.

** This topic reminds me of some fanfics that examine the idea of removing Slytherin. Logically, if Slytherin is truly the house of psychopaths and bullies as portrayed in canon, then why wouldn't the 'good' people in authority take action against it?

Personally, I never appreciated Slytherin until I started reading fanfiction. Many heroes throughout history have been cunning and/or ambitious. These traits can be a great power for good in the right hands.

--------------

A few fics that examine the problem of Slytherin:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4269983/1/][Anything But Slytherin]] - Only bad people get put in Slytherin? That makes a excelent early warning system so we can stamp out young Dark wizards before they become a problem!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][HPMOR]] - A few characters speculate that Dumbledore made Snape the Head of House for Slytherin deliberately to decrease the house's prestige, to increase its reputation for bullying, and to make the smart and ambitious children not want to be sorted there.

#+begin_quote
  "Think of Dumbledore becoming increasingly sad over this Hogwarts House that seems the source of so much ill-doing. And then behold, Dumbledore puts in as Head of Slytherin the person of Snape. Snape! Severus Snape! A man who would teach his House neither cunning nor ambition, a man who would impose lax discipline and make its children weak! A man who would offend students of other Houses, who would ruin Slytherin's name among them! A man whose surname was unknown in magical Britain and certainly not noble, who went about half in rags! Do you think Dumbledore ignorant of the consequence? When Dumbledore was the one who brought it about, and had motive to bring it about? I expect Dumbledore told himself that more lives would be saved during the next Wizarding War if Voldemort's future Death Eaters were weakened."

  "Continue the process long enough, and no child would want to go to Slytherin. The House would be retired, and if the Hat kept calling the name, it would become a mark of ignominy among children who would afterward be distributed among the other three Houses. From that day on, Hogwarts would have three upstanding Houses of courage and scholarship and industry, with no House of Bad Children added to the mix; just as if the three Founders of Hogwarts had been wise enough in the beginning to refuse Salazar Slytherin their company. That, I expect, was Dumbledore's intended end-game; a short-term sacrifice for the greater good."
