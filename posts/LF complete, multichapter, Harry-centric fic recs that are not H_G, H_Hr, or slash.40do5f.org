So I've been around a while, not a writer, but a reader, and I've reread my favorite stories probably a dozen times but I'm wondering if I'm missing some great fanfics out there (and I'm getting somewhat tired of my favorite fics from reading them too much). Not to mention it's become a chore to sift through FF.net lately; their filtering is pretty good but I feel like I've combed dozens of pages without finding anything new to read.

I'm looking for pretty much any complete, multichapter Harry-centric fics. As for pairings, I'm not a fan of H/G, H/Hr, or slash. Any genre works for me, too, except pure romance.

Thanks for reading (and hopefully recommending).

Some of the favorites I referenced (though y'all have probably read most of them already): Firebird Trilogy by Darth Marrs, Delenda Est by Lord Silvere, Shezza's Denarian series, Renegade Cause by Silens Cursor, joe6691, jbern, Reign of Power by Fayr Warning, nonjon, An Old and New World by Lens of Sanity, Perspicacity, jeconias, chelseyb, The Matt Silver, and probably some I've forgotten.


** linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff by Bajab; A Black Comedy by nonjon)

Both are really funny.

*** Have read both, unfortunately (and the sequels to Harry the Hufflepuff, too). A Black Comedy is one of my all time favorites.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

  Most of you remember the day that Severus Snape went to Voldemort, begging for the lives of the Potters. What if Voldemort had actually considered this and decided that Harry could be useful to him? How would the Wizarding World react to Harry Potter after he was raised by a Dark Lord? Dark!Harry. Annoying!Dumbledore. Rated T just in case. Now complete!
