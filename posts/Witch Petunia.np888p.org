Are there any fics where Petunia is a witch?


** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14074770]]) Petunia/Sirius. Very good.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14580930]]) Petunia is a professional Quidditch player(!) and marries Peter Pettigrew.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8864658/1/By-Baker-Street-Station-I-Sat-Down-and-Wept]]) Petunia becomes a witch after Lily dies. Becomes crackish.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18209111]]) Not read this one.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9506432/1/]]) More focus on Lily/James but Petunia is a witch and Lily isn't.

  (I am the one who says 'fuck you') - Benjamin Garcia, 'Ode to the Corpse Flower'.Petunia drips magic the way she drips anger. Sparingly. Subtly. Nothing overt or obnoxious. Nothing that attracts the stares of other children or the suspicion of adults. Just things that help her. Her dolls line back up after the football Lily was kicking about ruins their perfect symmetry. Her bed makes itself while she brushes her teeth meticulously. Tea that is slightly too hot or too cold settles to the perfect temperature. Magic maintains the realm of order she has built around herself.(A witch!Petunia and muggle!Lily AU, covering the Marauders' years at Hogwarts and the First Wizarding War).

  It's never easy to be brilliant, friendly, pretty, wonderfully talented Lily Evans' sister. Even when you're also a witch yourself. But Petunia Evans isn't one to just let herself fade in the background and be forgotten, not if she has anything to say about it (and she has plenty to say, even if she doesn't voice it out loud). Someday, she'll shine on her own, just wait and see! However, shining in a war-torn era isn't that easy when you're Muggleborn, and even more so when no matter what, Lily always seems to do everything better...

  Even after seven years in Slytherin, Petunia still believed that ultimately, there was justice in the world. Lily had her charm, and she had her magic. If they worked hard and preserved, everything would turn out according to plan. Lately though, she isn't so sure.

  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.
