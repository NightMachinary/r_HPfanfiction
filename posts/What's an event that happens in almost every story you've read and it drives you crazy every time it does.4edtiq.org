Personally, I'll never understand why almost every author kills Sirius. Drives me bloody insane it does.

I get it, he dies in canon and it's a big deal for Harry, but he doesn't have to die every time! ^{^{^{^{Please?}}}}

Stop killing my Sirius!


** Ron being non-existent through all the story. It's always Harry and Hermione, or Harry and [Insert Harry's love interest] who do everything, Ron is just there to cheer or worse, get jealous and ruin everything. I'm not saying he should be a mastermind and pwn all the wannabe dark lords noobs, but I think Ron, being Harry's best friend, get the shortest end of the stick in fanfiction.

** Harry meeting with the goblins and discovers he's the heir of all the founders/multi-biillionaire/Dumbledore is stealing from him etc. because the goblins are so friendly and nice. No. Just stop. I don't want to read about a single goblin again in my life.

Harry telling everyone about the Dursleys and bawwws about how they abused him, practically begging for pity. That is very different from the Harry in canon, who hated to be pitied, and preferred to keep embarrassing parts of his life to himself.

Similarly, Harry getting all angsty with tears in his eyes. I don't want to read Rita Skeeter articles. I have no idea where authors draw this portrayal from. Part of the reason I like Harry is that he isn't a bitch who cries at every little thing, and can actually keep his cool most of the time. And don't get me started on getting beat up by the fucking Dursleys, because if he allows that, he's never going to defeat even a flobberworm, not to mention Voldemort.

Since they are the first names of Harry's and Hermione's actors, they are also often used in stories who pair those two up - though certainly not exclusively, as some Claim. "Dan Granger" for example is a Story where the names are used and Harry is not paired with Hermione.

** - Sending Harry to the library which is a not-so-subtle move on the author's part so that they can info-dump a ton of their theories on magic in the form of Harry reading textbooks. Usually there's a couple long paragraphs in italics and it's just incredibly dry and Harry will just learn it to do some showy magic work in practice and then never do it again.

- If the story is a divergence from canon, usually post POA, then Harry will tell in great detail everything that's happened to him up until that point. It's usually an entire chapter of Harry rehashing PS, COS and POA and the other character (Sirius, Daphne, whoever) reacting to it.

Unless that technical detail becomes essential to the plotline, it'd make more sense to take tauntingly incomplete passages of this theory and have a professor spouting it while the characters are worried about something much more important- like who's going to the Yule ball with whom.

Unfortunately, post Hogwarts fics are even in worse shape, as they are generally angst/fluff/romance/smut stories without compelling or credible plot.

A theme I still haven't gotten enough is the situation where the Ministry continued to cater to the interests of pureblood extremists, and Harry and Co were upset enough to openly fight them, such as in *The Sum of Their Parts*, linkffn(11858167) and *Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution*, linkffn(10595005).

*Emperor* and *The Dark Lord Never Died*, linkffn(11773877;5904185), are still about fighting Voldemort, but at least the stories picked up after their Hogwarts years.

*** It was Lavender that had to leave the rabbit behind. But then Percy and Ron took a rat for a total of seven school years between them and no one says a thing. If JKR says the school rules only apply unless it's a plot point, then it's no wonder FF writers do it too.

But I do agree that unless the pet is going to be relevant in some way then there's no reason not to go with a standard cat/owl/toad. ^{^{She}} ^{^{says}} ^{^{while}} ^{^{writing}} ^{^{a}} ^{^{story}} ^{^{with}} ^{^{a}} ^{^{totally}} ^{^{pointless}} ^{^{pet}} ^{^{dog...}}

** Honestly, every story that has Dumbledore portrayed as a manipulative mastermind for no other reason than "for the Greater Good." It's done so often and (usually) so poorly that when I run into stories following this trope I seriously consider just not reading them unless there are some pretty big redeeming qualities.

The only other thing that annoys me more then the "manipulative Dumbledore" trope is when an author keeps manipulative Dumbledore around in the story for no other reason then to keep bashing him. It seems to be becoming a growing trend in stories where the author will fabricate excuses to keep Dumbledore in the story that don't fit with how the story has progressed. The most annoying justification in a lot of stories is the one that despite Dumbledore refuses to allow the deaths of Death Eaters and Voldemort, Harry needs to keep him around at Hogwarts because Dumbledore is the only one they ever feared. Except the biggest thing that Voldemort fears is death, so with the story presented in that context, there's no rational reason to keep Dumbledore around. The author just wants to keep hanging him up as a figurative punching bag so they can keep bashing the character.

Never mind that it's Halloween night, probably cold out and that there are literally drunk people celebration all over England, like we heard on the news all day." And don't even tell me he put a warming charm on Harry because those aren't canon.

I mean, I like Dumbledore and I hate all the terrible "for the greater good he'll do everything" crap but you have to admit he doesn't make the best first impression.

**** Halloween night? It was one or two days into November when they dropped Harry off. Also lol at drunk people celebrating all over England, it's a little bit bigger than a street you know.

Not to mention wizarding children aren't Muggle children. There are problems with Dumbledore leaving Harry with the Dursleys, but hardly any of the ones you mentioned.

***** You do not see the problem with leaving a toddler on a doorstep, at night, in November? Appart from the danger of Harry dying from exposure (I asure you even wizarding childen can do that) anyone cold have come by and picked him up. The milkman could have (no, wait. /should have/) called child services. You don't leave 15-month-old children alone in the streets at night with no protection. The blood protection wasn't at work yet as Petunia hadn't yet taken Harry into her home. There were still desperate and unorganized Death Eaters running around (as we know from what happened to Neville's parents). Would it have been such a terrible inconvenience to at least conjure a baby bed or something? Or better yet drop the child of in the morning?

***** Generally, people are expected to treat babies with more care than UPS packages. How hard would it have been to talk to the Dursleys? Then again, if he had discussed it with them Petunia would have likely refused, and that would have been inconvenient.
