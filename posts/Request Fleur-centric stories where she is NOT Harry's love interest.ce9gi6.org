I just realized something... if Fleur plays a large role in a story, it's always because it's a Harry/Fleur fic. If Fleur is in a story and NOT angled as Harry's love interest, she's usually a very minor character, who mainly exists to be French in the background.

So... are there any stories STARRING Fleur? Where she actually gets to be the main character, I mean? Or at least stories where she plays a large part (I'm talking playing a substantial role in the majority of the chapters) WITHOUT being paired with Harry? I think I'd like to see that.


** Order of Mercy. Great plotline and characters but fair warning:Fleur gets a bit kinky with Bill sometimes

*** Kinky with Bill is fine, so long as she's not kinky with Harry. :)

***** Yeah, but that's really the only way she gets a decent-sized role most of the time. Which is pretty silly...

***** ...the hell? What's a Doctor Who story doing here? And that first one... is a Harry-centric story with a Harry/Fleur pairing. Which was exactly what I said I DIDN'T want. What's up with this?

*** The problem is that Fleur is incredibly hot, hence people who want to use her in a fic tend to want to put her as a love interest because... well, because she's incredibly hot. I was mostly hoping that there were SOME people out there who actually bothered to use her for something more.

I think Fleur has a lot of potential as a character... potential that very few authors seem interested in letting her fulfill cause they're too busy having her be the incredibly hot girlfriend/prize for their protagonist (which is usually Harry).
