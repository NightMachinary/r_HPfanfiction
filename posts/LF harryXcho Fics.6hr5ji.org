Anything where Harry and cho are the main focus as long as there's no sex in it and it's complete is fine by me


** I liked "The Headman's hostage". While it had some short sex scenes at the end they are only a small part of the story and it also has one of the best depictions of Sirius Black.

  What if Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts had begun not with a dementor attack and a trumped-up charge but with a birthday party and a ransom note? In this AU, the Order's decision to pull Harry out of Privet Drive on July 31 has far-reaching consequences.
