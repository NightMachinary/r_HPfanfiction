I just read World War Z and want more. Know of any HP/WWZ crossovers or zombie apocalypse AUs?


** linkffn(7539141) might fit your description. I can't remember enjoying it but I think that was because I found the whole thing too depressing. You might like it though.

  A year has passed since the dead started returning to life. The fate of those hoping to survive and rebuild rests on the best and the worst of humanity, both wizards and Muggles, with their political ideologies and the ravenous undead in between, and it's up to Healer Harry Potter to save as many as he can in the crossfire. A Harry Potter Zombie Apocalypse Fanfiction. HP/AG.

** linkao3(The Breach by TheDivineComedian) is both short and not truly a crossover (the zombies are inferi), but still good.

  Hermione kept calling it the zombie apocalypse. Harry, whose introduction to muggle horror films had started and ended with fighting Dudley over the TV remote, wasn't sure if they should be called zombies, but thought "apocalypse" was an apt description. 6th year AU, in which Lord Voldemort actually got around to raising his army of Inferi.

  The end of the world has come. Millions dead, magic waning, Hermione Granger and Charlie Weasley are the last people left in Britain---left to pick up the pieces of their once great civilization. Why were they spared? Who is responsible for the death of a nation? These are the mysteries left as a legacy for two lost and lonely people.

#+begin_quote
  The war between humans and zombies rages even after five years. Military efforts to repel the hordes of undead prove less than entirely effective. A team of military medical specialists are brought together to try and find a solution. They are joined, however, by some unexpected participants. The survival of humanity rests in what emerges from the meetings. (First Tale)
