I need them for learning it. I've learnt English this way, it's the best way.

I like gen fics much more, but I would still welcome any recs you have


** ... Wow I am German and I am flabbergasted at how wrong it feels to me that there are fanfics in german... Like how it feels wrong to have a Harry potter story told from a first person perspective.

*** I can relate to that, I feel the same for my own language.

Could you perhaps recommend interesting fantasy books in german?

**** You could read "Tintenherz" or "Reckless" by Cornelia Funke. Also "Die Unendliche Geschichte" or "Momo" by Michael Ende are really good they actually are classical german children books but still awesome to read as an adult! Another great book would be "Das Parfüm" allthough it's not fantasy and sometimes quite gruesome.

Hope you like something :) And good look with learning german!!

**** Yes, so first of all there are numerous very good translations out there. So I would recommend first reading one you already know. I personally just love! Name of the wind or Der Name des Windes in German, though it is quite difficult. Something easier to start with would be the inheritance circle or in German Der Eragon Zyklus. Something original German would be the Tintenherz Trilogie: Tintenherz, Tintenblut, Tintentot. Quite fascinating worldbuilding though geared towards an older teen audience. Another original German work is: Instabil, Die Vergangenheit ist noch nicht Geschehen. That last one is more in the direction of sci-fi and/or urban fantasy. I could probably think of a few more but not at the Moment. Have fun and stay safe!

**** How proficient are you?

Do you think you can read a really long, complicated book or would you need something shorter and easier for now?

** For any German works I would recommend that you check out fanfiction.de

It ist just like ffn but with German works of many fandoms and even Indipendent works

*** Good advice! Checking it out right now

Though the lack of sorting by kudos is quite disappointing

** Look for "Wege eines Slytherins" by Sersi. One of the best German fics out there imo.

** I haven't read a fanfic in German in years, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5179143/1/Der-ohnm%C3%A4chtige-Diktator][this]] is one of my favourites:

linkffn(5179143)

The premise would probably be /what if all bad fanfictions suddenly came to exist in the Harry Potter universe simultaneously and Voldemort was the only one left who is unaffected/. It's crack, but quite well written.
