So I read dark repercussions ages ago and I was wondering if anyone has any other similar fics? Where the dark wins or Harry decides to just let loose. Preferences are over 40k words doesn't have to be completed. Thanks :)


** There was a similar [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/arqd0p/lf_fics_where_the_bad_guys_win_andor_voldemort/][request thread]] recently; maybe some of the fics that were recced there are interesting?
