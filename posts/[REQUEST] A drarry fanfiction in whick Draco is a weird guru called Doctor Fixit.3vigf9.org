Edit: *wich Sorry, I'm new here. How do I put a tag to my post title?

I'm looking for a post war story where Harry has broken up with Ginny and his life is going all wrong. He decides to do something and try to help poor people, then discover a guru that names himself Doctor Fixit, that lives frugally and cure people of their problems in public demonstrations. It happens thar Dr. Fixit is Draco Malfoy, totally changed, actually quite OOC. He can't stand living Draco living at the streets and take him home, where he turns Harry's live upside down. It's really weird and full of slang, I remember Fixit always saying "I don't believe in bedframes". Have anyone seen it? I can't find it in google nor rec lists.
