Hello! I'm currently working on a story that'll mainly deal with Mahoutokoro School of Magic and Magical Japan. Since my MC will also have an interest in duelling, I'm probably gonna have to at least use a few spells.

Now, the question is, should I create new spells with roots in Japan, Korea, China etc instead of Europe? Because all spells we've seen in HP are either based in Latin, Greek or weird English.

But I also don't want to confuse my readers! Using existing spells that are easily recognizable is less complicated, and in the end, they're just words, right?

(But I also don't want to have Latin-based spells in /Japan/ of all places...)

The decision is a hard one! The more realistic approach, or the one a casual reader has an easier time with?


** I think Sanskrit would make sense for all of Asia, since it is used in old Hindu and Buddist texts and presumably all of Europe uses Latin so a national language can't be the magical one. You can't just make it drawing kanji because muggleborns would be accidentally making faulty ofuda's all the time and blowing themselves up.

*** Sanskrit sounds really interesting! I know even less about that than the few things I know about the other languages I mentioned, but I'll definitely look into it. Maybe for the older spells? A mix of language-bases should be the best to use anyway. Latin is pretty unique in its use throughout Europe (language of Religion, language of science, but also at one point a very dead language, plus the language of the empire that at one point had almost all of Europe conquered). So I think in Japan, most 'newer' spells are either brought in from abroad or made with Chinese/Japanese languages.

** *#1:* Avoid incantations. Effect descriptions will work just as well for most situations. For those that won't, the group will be rather small. Especially if you're keeping the "Hero Analysis for the Future" as a thing, 'Zuku would be able to provide an in-story explanation why a given character would use a given spell, and be motivated to learn non-verbal casting.

*#2:* Spell mechanics. Do you treat spells like in DnD or as executables, where a spell is a fixed structure that gives a set effect in exchange for spell components, be they verbal, somatic or material? Are they merely focusing patterns, where a spell exists in a given form because a given word is culturally significant and subconsciously associated with effect (and thus helping actualize it)?

*#3:* Spell exchanges. Spells taught at a school are unlikely to be super-secret Family Lore ones. If "Name a Wizarding Polity" invented a particularly good spell and didn't keep it secret, chances are it would be adopted by others. A line or two in the story explaining that ie. {"Stupefy" might sound strange, but is actually pretty good for something a Brit made. }

*Extra:* If it's a MHA cross, you'd need to know how your world evolved since 2000's, things like international cooperation and SoS. How did quirks affect that? Did the wizards come out in the open, are they disguising magic as quirks? This doesn't have to be a big plot point, but it is an important piece of background that you need to keep in mind while writing events that diverge from the initial premise of either setting. As long as you place your Chekhovs well,you can get away with anything.

That means, the explanations do not have to be too detailed if the story is more about characters interacting, as long as it stays non-contradictory.

â€‹

TLDR: You can take any approach, as long as there is an in-story reason for it. Isolationism would tip the scales towards native spells, a more open and connected society would lean more towards "Any spell might be used if it sounds cool enough, including OS".

TLDR extra: If an thing is different from canon, it's up to you to engineer a chain of events providing an explanation. Be it a character, trait, or the whole setting.

*** Thanks so much for your help! This is like an additional little Christmas gift for me, you're awesome!

*#1* That is an excellent idea. The HAFs are pretty essential to Izuku, and it makes so much sense that he'd do something similar for his spells, especially with him going into duelling.

*#2* I'm leaning hard towards "Focusing Patterns", although in canon, the whole premise doesn't make much sense (Book 6, Harry can cast two spells without knowing the effect). I've talked a bit about it with my HP group, though, in which practised association plays a huge (but not the only) part in it. It's probably not going to be very important for this fic, though. But with many theories floating around in fandom, it's good to settle with one, I guess? Wand patterns and the history of magical languages and the impression of hundreds and thousands of years of use play a role, too, but I really need to not nerd out here...

*#3-4* Oh yeah, that's definitely happening! I want something organic, if that makes sense? From old spells that are well-known throughout East Asia, to more modern spells and imported spells... and Japan was always a bit more isolated from the rest of the world until fairly recently (in rl). So I can see there being 'trends' about what kind of spells the kids are learning these days. It's basically the same as languages - neighbouring places borrow a lot out of each other's languages and it shows in language families etc. Only that with spells, modern communication makes sharing so much easier!

** Is your MC an OC or a canon character? I find the idea interesting.
