The next update for my fic features a Voldemort vs Dumbledore duel and I want to make it good, something befitting two greatest wizards in the series.

I'm looking for inspiration and examples to help me out. My resources include the canon OotP duel and a bunch of fanfics, but I will welcome recommendations, even if they overlap with the fics I already know.

If you could link directly to the chapter featuring the duel, or indicate it in your posts, it would make things easier for me.


** I always thought that Dumbledore's duel with Voldemort in OOtP was special because it introduced new, unnamed spells with unique effects to the canon repertoire. I haven't read any fanfics that come close to recapturing the sense of Dumbledore's calm reassurance and Voldemort's arrogance.

- Voldemort conjures a 'shining silver shield out of thin air' to deflect Dumbledore's unnamed spell (which is so powerful that causes the hairs on the back of Harry's neck to stand on end as it passes).

- Dumbledore's flame whip spell and Voldemort's transfiguration of fire to a serpent.

- Dumbledore's transformation (not likely a transfiguration) of the of the water in the Ministry atrium fountain into 'a cocoon of molten glass' that is capable of suffocating Voldemort

- Dumbledore binds the remaining Death Eaters with 'invisible ropes,' not the conjured ropes that appear in nearly every fanfic.

In addition to the above unique spells, look at the language JKR uses throughout the scene.

- 'Harry's scar burst open' This is figurative, but painted with hyperbolic (and inaccurate) language. Blood doesn't flow into his eyes, he's simply overwhelmed with the pain accompanying Voldemort's attempted possession.

- The stark differences in the two combatants' speech patterns and dialogue tags throughout the scene: Voldemort 'snarls, calls, spat' while Albus is described as 'calm, speaking as lightly as though they were discussing the matter over drinks, walk[ing ...] as though he had not a fear in the world'

- Wand movements: Dumbledore 'flicks, waves, etc' but Voldemort's are never described. TMR's speech patterns and surrounding narration make it clear to the reader, though, that he's probably not /half/ as calm as Albus throughout the scene and his fighting style probably reflects that mental state.

If I had a fic to rec, I'd be happy to share it. Unfortunately, IMO there aren't any scenes in fanfic that come close to distilling their individual characteristics so well. Most fics:

- Don't take chances introducing new magic, choosing instead to regurgitate fanon spells

- Last too long. Dumbledore's fight with TMR is around 600 words by my estimate.

- Use identical narration to describe both combatants.

Avoid these pitfalls and I think your scene will stand out from the others. Sorry if this isn't very helpful.

**** No problem. I think the key is making up new spells, but not giving discrete Properly Capitalised Latin names to them, thus preserving an air of mystery. Even if your protagonist is a /very/ capable Harry Potter, the AD/TMR fight should blow him away with their /casual/ inventiveness.

***** Actually, I'm writing it from Voldemort's POV, so that's an additional challenge. I have an idea for an awesome spell, Dumbledore's ultimate move. It's not just about spells, though. I have to make sure to convey their characters through their actions.

*** I'd say that length isn't really that important of a factor. If a duel between them is long, the writing and description can still be high quality. It can still be epic, creative, and stick with the two character's characterization.

Also, in OotP, Voldemort's not supposed to be there, in the ministry. That wasn't the plan, he's supposed to not be seen by the ministry. So he has an interest in keeping it short. But once the minister and the aurors come, he should leave. He's now facing Dumbledore /and/ others who, while not at his level, could still help out. He'd likely lose. But what if that wasn't a concern? If Dumbledore and Voldemort met in open battle or in some situation where they had an interest in duking it out, it could potentially be an extremely long battle. Basically, I'm saying that their battle being short isn't due to the fact that it's a battle between Voldemort and Dumbledore, but other factors.

Absolutely! It's just that authors often have their Battle of the Ages last two thousand words while strictly adhering to the stations of canon for that chapter of OOtP. Unnecessary filler doesn't make a scene more interesting.

** I have Dumbledore and Voldemort facing off twice in "Uncle Quentin's Spy". [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11102515/15/Uncle-Quentin-s-Spy][Chapter 15]] should fit your question. It also hits at least some of MacsenWledig's criteria (new spells, new tactics) - though there's not much dialogue during the actual duel.

**** Yes, though this is the one that - in my opinion - comes closest to a the kind of duel the OP wanted. The duel in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/22/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][chapters 22 and 23]] of "The Dark Lord Never Died" was not quite that detailed.

The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/58/Patron][fight in chapters 58]] of "Patron" involved others as well, and the final fight in chapters 59 and 60 doesn't fit the request.

** iirc there is a pretty good duel between a time-travelling Harry and Dumbledore in The Unforgiving Minute linkffn(6256154). Usually when Harry is strong enough to fight Dumbledore the fic is full of tropes and is pretty bad but this one is an exception imo. Don't remember which chapter the dual is in so you may have to skim through to find it, but I'm pretty sure they fight outside of the Gaunt house when Harry goes to get rid of the ring Horcrux.

** I remember reading this fic, where Voldemort and Dumbledore have an absolutely insane duel in a muggle neighborhood. Both Dumbledore and Voldemort get shot by muggle guns in the chaos.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6413108/23/To-Shape-and-Change]]

I don't believe it introduces lots of new, obscure spells, but it's still a very good duel which I actually re-read a few times before moving on.
