** Back when I was a kid on the Internet in 2002/2003, there existed a parody of Redwall fanfiction I found endlessly funny. It featured a character named [[http://redlea.net/pslagar/view.php?page=fanfic][Superstripe the Unrealistic]], and this is the first time in years I've had cause to think of it:

#+begin_quote
  Superstripe scrached his head with his enormos hands. "Hmm... I better travel lightly. Ill pack only the basics: my elastic silk sling, studded leather glove, super sharp, two handed, double bladed sword, hatchet, throwing axes, axe of brocktree, war mallet, blow gun ,axe of badgers, leviathan death blade, badger warhammer, fire pebbles, and my serrated hatchet. Oh, also my shield of death, shoulder spikes, war helmet, badger plaitmail, my chain neck protector, flint, a smoke bomb and a flask Grumm's finest magic ale. And a turban... for disguise"
