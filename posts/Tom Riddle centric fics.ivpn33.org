I want to start reading fics that are (if you couldn't guess from the title) Tom Riddle centric! I've read lots that maybe feature him a bit more than usual, but none that make him a/the main character.

As for requirements, go wild! I don't mind what ship it is, if there's character bashing, or the rating. I just want to read as many as I can. Preferably long fics or completed stories, but if there's a really good one shot that you'd recommend, or a story that regularly updates I would totally be down to read it!!


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13103526/1/Birds-of-a-Feather][Birds of a Feather]] is one of my favourites because of its very high quality and character development. The main idea is quite odd: Hermione is born in the 1920s and attends Hogwarts together with Tom, but unlike many stories with odd main ideas, this one actually works. Unfortunately, the story appears to be on a long hiatus, if not abandoned. linkffn(13103526)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13275002/1/The-Imposter-Complex][The Imposter Complex]] has been quite popular ever since the first chapter was published last year. It is work in progress, but appears to be nearing the finale. It follows Tom Riddle's diary who becomes an independent agent after the events of CoS. Some people may dislike the use of first person point of view, but this story does not have the flaws usual for such stories (power fantasy etc.) linkffn(13275002)

  In 1935, Hermione Granger meets a boy who despises fairy stories, liars, and mediocrity. He offers her a deal of mutual convenience, and soon a tentative friendship forms---if Tom would ever lower himself to call anyone a "friend". But whatever they have, it's something special, and if there's anyone who can appreciate Specialness, it's Tom Riddle. (1930's Childhood Friends AU)

  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.

Thought it might admittedly be a little bit too much of a crackfic for some people's tastes.

  When Tom Riddle walked through a doorway one fall afternoon everything changed and he found himself in a world wholly unprepared for him. "Something about you makes my brain itch," Hermione Granger said. "As if an earthquake had shifted everything sharply two feet to the left and then back again and it didn't all fit back quite right." Tomione. AU. COMPLETE.

  The war is over, the good guys have won, and Hermione Granger goes to sleep in her lovely flat only to wake up in 1953 in the bed of someone she'd really much rather were dead. "I'm working on the 'kill Lord Voldemort now, work out the temporal paradox issues later' plan," she tells him. He laughs. Tomione. COMPLETE

Stuck in the past due to a broken time turner, Lord Voldemort again decides the only person he needs to depend on is himself.

Basically he adopts his younger self.

  Brilliant, indifferent, thunderous Tom Riddle who was like an explosion happening inside a steel cage. Enigmatic and haunting and probably not worth her time but Florence couldn't look away...It's 1944 and Florence Allman is set to debut to the Wizarding Society of the Southeastern United States in less than a year, which means in less than a year she will be eligible for marriage. Except that she's not ready for that, at least not yet. When her father, a wealthy businessman and plantation owner is offered a deal by the British Ministry of Magic to help fight Gellert Grindelwald, Florence accompanies him from Georgia to England where she is to complete her seventh year of magical education at Hogwarts and experience some of life before it's taken away from her forever. Except that she's woefully behind in her studies, and even worse, there's this boy.
