Hey guys,

haven't had much time to read fanfiction in a while, but now I want to kind of make up for lost time and I have a request:

I'd like your best stories where Harry is like TMR (without the sadism if possible), so he's good at magic, willing to learn, interested in obscure and dangerous magics etc.

Bonus points if he puts together a group of friends (and followers, because lets face it: He would probably never fully agree with Draco's bias against muggleborns, but he would cultivate the guy as an ally (networking and all that))

NOTE: No Slash please :)

So, the stage is yours - GO WILD :)

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.
