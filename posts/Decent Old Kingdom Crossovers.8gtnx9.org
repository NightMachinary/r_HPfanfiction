I think I've exhaustively checked FFN at this point and been unimpressed. Does anyone know of good ones from other places that I'm terrible at searching, like AO3?

For clarification, I mean the Old Kingdom setting as created by Garth Nix, with necromancy and Charter Magic.


** I've been looking for the same thing, not that it's any help, but I haven't found anything yet. I'm really hoping someone writes something of the sort soon. I'd love to see say a young Dumbledore enter the Old Kingdom or something of the sort.

*** If I wasn't working on another fic, I'd be looking into this. I'm having enough trouble with the one, though, so I'm not sure I should start on a second. I did consider it for a bit but wasn't sure how to meld the two worlds together (I'm not sure I'd want to just throw Harry into the Old Kingdom unless there was a plot device that actually made good sense).

**** Plot devices are difficult, however, we have the Great Rift at the north of the Old Kingdom which is implied to open onto other worlds. If combined with His Dark Materials like experiments in the Harry Potter world it might offer a reason of sorts for someone to come through. I personally favour youngish Dumbledore because of the obvious comparisons between Ancelstierre and 1920s England, and the fact that a young Dumbledore could easily be regarded as a dedicated researcher: the sort of person who /would/ go through such a breach just to find out more.

***** The mention of His Dark Materials made me think of the witches and Dumbledore talking about the sanctity of the soul and... Fawkes is a daemon, right? :p

But yes I was having trouble reconciling the time periods of each setting, and that works out really well. I was vaguely thinking about the viability of a fusion setting where The Old Kingdom is Scotland, and magic escaped into the world after the Wall was breached... but that raises the problems with tech levels even more.

****** You know I hadn't thought it through fully, but that would be fantastic. I would doubly read a fic like that. Please in the name of everything holy write this when you have the time!

** I'm fairly certain linkffn(Circular Reasoning by SwimDraconian) features the bell necromancy from the Old Kingdom series. Been a while since I read it though

  Torn from a desolate future, Harry awakens in his teenage body with a hefty debt on his soul. Entangled in his lies and unable to trust even his own fraying sanity, he struggles to stay ahead of his enemies. Desperation is the new anthem of violence.

*** It lightly touches on it, but it feels more like a cameo than a crossover. Thanks though, I do like this fic :)
