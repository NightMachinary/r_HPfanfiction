i personally think it would be a dementor tbh


** Personally I think it would be a snake, but I also think he'd be fundamentally incapable of producing one.

**** I don't think it's a particularly happy memory considering Dumbledore, and he acted like he already knew he was special. Maybe when he first arrived at Hogwarts and saw the magnificent castle he could now associate with home could be something to make him genuinely happy.

** The basilisk from the Chamber of Secrets would make sense. I also think he may have even been able to cast it... up until he created a horcrux. He would've wanted to master such advanced magic, but then gave it up for the sake of his greater goals.

** Dark wizards aren't capable of light magic, and the patronus charm is very much light magic. Voldy wouldn't be able to do one.

But, if he could, it would probably be Nagini

*** Amazing, everything of what you just said is wrong!

Okay not really I just had to use that quote, I agree with you a bit

1. Yes the Patronus is light magic, if that's even a thing, we only know that dark magic is a thing, but as far as I can remember, "light magic" was never mentioned

2. Yeah I'd almost agree to it being Nagini, except that it would likely be another more agressive snake breed

Now here you are wrong, dark wizards were mentioned, but it was never said that they couldn't cast light magic.

look at Snape, he fits rather well into the category of dark wizard (uses and knows dark magic, has even created some,a follower of a dark lord) yet he can cast the patronus, a spell that is light magic (derives from happy memories --> thus good/light)

Tom would most definitely be able to cast it, it's powerful magic so he would have wanted to learn it, even Voldy probably could cast it, the spell is from /happy/ memories, and Voldy does still have happy memories, even if the memories are now from death and destruction rather than something like finding out he's the heir of Slytherin, finding out he's a wizard or coming to Hogwarts.

Ok now sorry for this damn rant, god I need to re-order my brain

Evitative is an amazing fic (on ao3 if you haven't read it) and it reflects your beliefs rather well
