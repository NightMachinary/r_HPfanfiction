:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for good fics where Harry gets a different but unique wand.

The one that I am looking for specifically is one where Ollivander gives him a multi core wand that is apparently one of his most ridiculous creations and has 3 wand cores (I may be off on the number here). Apparently it is a very volatile thing and he even goes in to explain that the magical backlash could have taken out half the Alley if it had gone wrong. Also, he mentions that Grindelwald also had a multi core wand.

Any clue which fic this is?

Also, leads on any fic that you remember with unique wands/foci that Harry uses would be grateful..


** Well, you've only narrowed it down to every fic written between 2007 and 2011

** Sorry I don't know of such a fic but the question made me lol, imagining wands being like computers, so there's an Intel vs AMD thing going on with 8 core and 16 core wands. There are even NVidia wands whose centers are like fiber optic bundles with 1000s of cores, but they all have to cast the same spell at the same time. The Intel and AMD wands let you cast 8 or 16 different spells simultaneously. Heh.

** Rocking the Boat linkffn(5721324) isn't the fic you're thinking of, but it does have a wand with 4 cores in it. In it, harry gets a custom wand because regular wands would burn out from the amount of power he can shove through them so he needs a really thick, many core, pistol wand to handle it

** I'm pretty sure its an important part of every super!harry fic ever.

Oh you have Yggdrasil and wood from the tree of death and hair from the foot of the first giant and fecal matter from the royal phoenix etc. etc. And then ollivander is like oh this will be the most powerful wand ever and i will give it to you for free becoz tis' a weapon of the gods.
