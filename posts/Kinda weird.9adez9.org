So my roommate wants to see a snippet collection about Harry bringing his GF home to the Dursley' s for whatever reason and every time it's a strange magical creature


** Not sure how much I'll write or how often, but it's a good enough idea to me, got one snippet up now, and a couple ideas for more.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13046741/1/Meeting-The-Family][Meeting The Family]], linkffn(13046741)

No guarantees that it will /always/ be a magical creature however, I'm thinking aliens have potential as well.

Edit: Second chapter up.

Edit 2: This fics proving easy to write, got a third chapter up- though it's not showing quite yet, my favorite so far.

  Harry Potter as much as he tried was never normal, so why should his love be any different? A snippet and one-shot selection of tales that will horrify, disgust and hopefully amuse you.

** I'm picturing Aunt Petunia agonizing over what kind of salad to offer Harry's centaur girlfriend.

** Am I your roommate? Because now I want to see that too.

The closest I can think of (Harry having a close female friend who's a magical creature) is in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5585493/1/Enter-the-Dragon][Enter the Dragon]]; I don't quite think it's a romantic entanglement, but Suze the centaur is Harry's friend and starts playing a significant supporting role halfway through the chapter.

Maybe there's also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9279255/1/On-An-Island-In-The-Sun][On An Island In The Sun]]? Magical creatures happen a fair bit in that one, including in the omake chapter.
