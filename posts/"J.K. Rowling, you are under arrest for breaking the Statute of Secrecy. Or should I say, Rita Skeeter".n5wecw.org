** "Do you realize how hard it is to convince Muggleborns we're not a total incompetent backward society as depicted in your books? At least three of Durmstrang's Muggle-born prospective students begged their parents to move to France when they realize they're magical, thinking Durmstrang to be a 'dark-art' teaching school and full of pureblood supremacist.", Auror Oddpick looked at Skeeter exasperatedly. He wondered if Skeeter is planning to claim her writings to be a work of fiction so the statue doesn't apply. Indeed, he himself had only managed to find three facts in her entire series.

** I never like the 'JKR is Skeeter' theory, but another witch who actually hates Rita Skeeter? Definitely!

Here is my version/prompt:

The Harry Potter series is a disinformation campaign and propaganda piece initiated by Hermione Granger, but ultimately approved by Harry Potter. Its main purpose was to test Muggles' reaction to the concept of magic. Needless to say, the results vastly exceeded their most optimistic expectation. Not only did most Muggles like the story, but many of them would even flash wands in the public, and things got a lot safer for real wizards. Furthermore, they made billions of Pounds off those gullible Muggles.

In the real version however, the line between good and evil was far more murky. The real Voldemort was nothing like described in the Books. He neither looked like a snake nor did he mutilate his own soul (although he did perform several dark rituals to increase his magical power). The winners of war simply bashed him into oblivion.

Although he fought for a cause that might appear archaic to the modern Muggle world, it nevertheless made some sense in the Magical World. Their key conflict was how Wizarding Britain should be governed. Voldemort favored the traditional oligarchy in which 'Old Families' called the shots, while Dumbledore wanted to turn the Ministry into a centralized modern government. The boiling point was reached when Dumbledore tried to pass a law that slapped enormous inheritance tax as a mean to weaken the 'Old Families'.

Tom Riddle had been teaching DADA from 1957 to 1968 when he resigned the post in protest. The war began in earnest when MoM tried to arrest him for his almost militant opposition to the Inheritance Tax in 1971. From then on, he adopted the mantle 'Lord Voldemort' as he completed a very important power boosting ritual.

Voldemort inspired loyalty not through wantonly torturing his followers, as the Books so fondly depicted, but through persuasion, protection, and true leadership. He was also very protective of his loyal members, and went to great length to extract retributions for their sufferings.

His tactics were brutal and ruthless, but so were his enemies that were supposed to be on the 'right side on history'. Both sides did commit their shares of atrocities, as was generally the case in a civil war. His chief lieutenant Bellatrix Lestrange was indeed a fanatic and sadistic warrior, but on the other hand, Frank Longbottom was the Order's chief henchmen who had killed and tortured many Death Eaters.

But in the end, despite defeating his arch rival Albus Dumbledore in a decisive engagement, Voldemort underestimated the cunning and ruthlessness of the young Trio, walked into their traps, and was killed.

After his death, the winners instituted systematic purges in Wizard Britain, silenced most critics, and used propaganda heavily to legitimize their cause. To their credits, the overall living standard and opportunities for the masses have significantly improved under their rule, and they did eventually earn their legitimacy.

**** I think that for the purpose of the prompt it was important to highlight the atrocities Dumbledore's side was committing and the justification of Voldemort's actions. That's not to say that Dumbledore or Harry have to be otherwise very different from their canon counterparts... it's just the lengths they are willing to go that are embellished. Also, Voldemort may be a good leader to his followers, but he can be with non-Death Eaters just as cruel as in the series. There's still a very high chance you won't survive an encounter with him if you're not on his side.

** "Dammit Skeeter" said Harry. "what is it with you and pairing me off with my friends?" "Are you trying to get Mrs. Weasley mad at me for dating Ginny on the side? Everyone Knows I married Luna." "Also where the Bloody hell did you get this abused child who grew up under the stairs thing??" I was very skinny as a kid. But that because my Uncle died when I was 7 from heart problems due to ignoring his weight." Me and my aunt became vegans afterwards."

Now onto Hermione Granger.. Who the Hell is she? I'm positve I never met a girl by with her name? Did you seriously make up her just to Make me look lazy? You do know that I spend hours in the library. Costing by on luck and fame? Get real.

Vegans don't eat meat products..Yes Skeeter That is a real thing.

Also why are you telling people I was a horcurx? Are you trying to start a panic? For your information there were 17 other people who spoke Parseltounge in school with me. Its only rare because Riddle killed everyone who could speak it. He did not like the idea that he was not special and unique.

And Why would I ever become an Auror? I spent my whole life fighting dark wizards. Let someone else deal with them for a change. I chose to become a Researcher.

Also why did you come up with those silly names for my kids? Albus Severus Potter? The bravest men I knew? I hated both of them. Also Snape was not a spy for the light. He was playing both sides just to the point where he could join the winning side at the end. And Albus was someone I barely knew. He left hogwarts in my second year. He was 135 after all.

**** I don't find it being hard to believe that voldemort would do that. We have seen many instances both subtle and not of tom riddle being vain and egocentric. He takes pride in his heritage, not because he cares about history and the idea of a legacy, but because it puts him above others. His hatred of muggles is partially because he refuses to be compared to 'lesser beings'.

His whole deal it that 'I am better than anyone else'. And any who could pose a threat to that would be killed.

Its something that came to me due to the whole parselmouths 'being evil' concept. I find it hard to believe that due to the lack of evidence. Voldemort was evil. Salazar was perhaps evil. We really never got an answer besides the whole rumor's from 2000 years ago. And we have seen history being incorrect before in regards to HP cannon.

I wonder how much the parselmouths being evil concept was influenced by the cathlic religion.

Makes me wonder. Because depending on your religion snakes are anything from evil to sacred.

***** 'heavily jawed face', 'mannish hands', 'a surprisingly strong grip'

As far as I know, many women, especially those that do not live quaint little lives in the middle of a city, have some of those characteristics. Saying it's "proof that she's trans because someone somewhere wrote a biased bad trans character that was somewhat like that and whose purpose was to bas trans characters" is pulling so hard at straws that they end up flying in the sky.

Must I remind you when the books were written? June 2000. In this date, nobody talked about the trans condition. And sure, it existed, blablabla, but still. It was basically nonexistent in the medias. So why would she write a trans character in her book?

Listen, I get that you want J.K. Rowling to be the biggest piece of shit this side of the Earth, it makes you feel all tingly inside. You get a rush of dopamine by finding every little things that could be interpreted wrong. But you have to remember, this is just you, and people like you, that can see it. Because *there's nothing to see*. Rita Skeeter isn't J.K. Rowling's long lasting plan to break eggs on trans people 20 years ago, to make them feel awful about writing an horrible character that, if you look at it a certain way, may look trans.

Rita Skeeter just suffer from the "bad guy syndrome" in Harry Potter. What's the "bad guy syndrome"? It's simple, if you're a good guy, then you're good looking, full of energy, colorful, your face looks kind, etc; and if you're a bad guy, you're ugly, have health problems, everyone compares you to a disgusting thing. Umbridge is a toad-like woman, fat, and nauseatingly pink. Voldemort is snake-faced, pale, long, thin and sinister. Severus Snape has greasy hair, a crooked nose, and bat-like features.

********* You're quoting the part where I say that good guys are good lookings and bad guys bad looking, and then using this as evidence that somehow, that part right here is proof of her transphobia.

So, that either means that all bad guys, who are ugly, are trans, or all trans, who are ugly, are bad guys. Since there's no confirmed trans in Harry Potter, and the closest to that we've got is book 7's "7 Harrys" chapter, and maybe Tonks, then that means it's the first one, aka all bad guys are trans.

I just applied your lack of logic in a logical continuation. Not my fault it doesn't suit you. Maybe you should learn how to write and the value of words, before criticizing my reading comprehension.

********** No, no. You don't get to distract from the actual point at hand. Why do you give J.K. Rowling, notorious transphobe, the benefit of the doubt in this instance? When her words echo a famously transphobic passage, why do you insist that there's nothing there, that we're just making it all up?

*********** And WHAT is this notorious, famous, transphobic passage? I always hear it mentionned, yet never by name! It's always "oooh, there was this once transphobic passage that was uttered once, and Rita Skeeter is kinda like that, if you squint your eyes and look at it sideways".

So, as long as nobody ever gives this "notorious famous transphobic message" to me, I'll continue to act as if it didn't exist. Then, once I get it, I'll do some basic research to determine if there is a possibility that yes or no J.K.Rowling did indeed create Rita Skeeter, a cliche mean journalist, to poke at trans people.

  You have excellent reading comprehension. Absolutely superb. It's stunning how well you grasped the point.
#+end_quote

I rest my case.

First, the Silkworm. Released in 2014, 14 years after GoF. Mentalities can change, /people/ can change. If you deny that, then you deny the fact that people are not born evil and that they can become better, that they can learn. Because if one can change for the better, they can become worse.

So, apart from the 15 years gap, aka *half a generation*, let's compare the two characters. I'll always do it this way : Rita Skeeter / Pippa Midgley

For the face:

#+begin_quote
  "Skeeter was described as having blonde hair set in elaborate curls that contrasted oddly with her heavy-jawed face" " Her blonde curls were curiously rigid, suggesting it was styled with the magical equivalent of hairspray. In addition, she had pencilled-on eyebrows and three gold teeth "
#+end_quote

‚Äã

#+begin_quote
  "with a long pale face with large brown eyes and thick dark wavy hair that fell to her shoulders."
#+end_quote

‚Äã

For the overall appearance:

#+begin_quote
  "large, masculine hands" "thick fingers ending in two-inch nails, painted crimson"
#+end_quote

‚Äã

#+begin_quote
  "She is described as being tall and thin" "Her fingers terminated in pointed crimson nails"
#+end_quote

‚Äã

My oh my, a similarity! You are right, it seems Rita Skeeter was written to be a representation of Rowling's transphobia! That or this article talking about the most popular nail color ([[https://www.whowhatwear.co.uk/popular-nail-colors-2021]]) is lying about red being the "next in for 2021", and this video is lying about the 2000's most popular nail color being red. What is red? Closer to crimson than green, that's for sure.

‚Äã

Personality wise, I can't say much. The silkworm is so unknown, I have difficulties with the limited time I have left for today to find anything of substance. What I got was that she's undergoing therapy, which is actually not that uncommon for trans people, and she took a creative writing course. Which is not personality, but at this point i'll take whatever. But she seems to be somewhat open, kind - not a nasty, horrible woman. The only bad part of her, at least as written in the book by Rowling, is her being trans.

Compared to Skeeter, a nasty, old prune, hated by everyone and anyone not for what she is but for what she does. Nosy, uncaring, willing to do anything for a good story. She lies, and bends the truth, for no other reasons than personal gains. She spy on people by using her illegal animagus form, making her a criminal, which Pippa is not.

So, personality wise, even knowing as little about Pippa as I do, I can tell that they are totally different.

‚Äã

So far, the only similarity appearance wise was that they had crimson nails, and personality wise, they write different kind of fiction. At least, I think so; Pippa may have not written anything after her creative writing course.

‚Äã

So yeah, I'll end here. As far as I'm concerned, I was right. This is only some vague coincidence, that blew out of proportion.

Also it's hilarious that you would think that people who have gained a new understanding of an author wouldn't look at that author's work with a new lens.
