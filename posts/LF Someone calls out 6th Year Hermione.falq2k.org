Puberty did. Yeah, it's boring to read about puberty, but it makes sense, I guess.

Or did we forget the cringy, stupid stuff we did back then?

** "Hey Hermione," said Harry, "Like seriously, what the fuck? Why are you being so /lame/ and /bitchy/ this year? Last year you were cool and all, but, like, helping Ron out and breaking the rules? Not okay, man! Rules are important when it comes to quidditch! Not blindly believing in my suspicions about Malfoy? Totally not okay. Having a crush like a normal teen girl? Geez, Hermione, what's gotten into you? And calling me out for basically cheating with a book that I'm not really sharing with you and Ron? Hermione, I'm so disappointed. You were so awesome last year, but look at you now! This just isn't on."

"Harry," said Hermione. "Nobody actually talks to their friends like that in real life, you know? This isn't how a heart to heart works; it's called bashing. Are you going to become Lord Potter-Peverell-Black next?

"Also, I don't remember you having a problem with rule breaking when /you/ were doing it. When you do it, actually, because it happens all the time. Remember the last time you obsessed about a guy in Slytherin, and it turned out that big bad /Snape/ was saving you, and /Quirrell/ was actually evil? I don't see you avoiding crushes either, Harry, or should I go break poor Ginny's heart? And yes, Harry, I wonder why I'm against you cheating, considering that I'm a hardworking bookworm? I'll give you three guesses, and the first one doesn't count."

edit: unpopular opinion, I see. Sorry, it might be hard to accept, but as it turns out, writing down most of what's in the OP actually does result in *bashing*. Pretty hypocritical bashing for anyone in the trio, too, considering they've all done a lot of rule-breaking and assholery together and to each other. It'd be nice if people were just honest about wanting Hermione-bashing fics instead of going through all this runaround.

*** First one, actually using a Confundus Charm for a Sports Tryout is just OOC, it's not even breaking rules, it's just dumb, even if McLaggen is a prick, he would have won because Ron had shit tier confidence, it would have made more sense if she cast a confidence boosting spell on Ron. It's entirely out of character for Hermione to Confund McLaggen over Quidditch Tryouts for her Crush, Yet, she flipped her shit when Harry pretended to put Felix Felicis in Ron's drink to give him a confidence boost (and didn't even ask that he might have faked it. Harry isn't some god tier Sleight of Hand Magician)

Second one: Malfoy Sr was a Death Eater, Malfoy Jr was a Wizarding Neo-Nazi and Harry saw Malfoy threaten someone with his arm, and with Greyback. It's PIS that Hermione didn't believe Harry, because if she did, they'd have gotten into the Room where Malfoy was fixing the Vanishing Cabinet and stopped him, and the Death Eaters in Hogwarts bit wouldn't happen.

Fourth: Harry offered to Share. Using an annotated Textbook isn't cheating. The only retard move Harry did in regards to the book was not trying the spells out in the Room of Requirement beforehand (Sectumsempra - For Enemies. It has the word Cut in the name (In latin but still) People learn from their parents or friends notes all the time. A Super annotated book, Hermione would have acted logically and gone through them all to make sure they were actually legit improvements for Harry's own safety rather than whined about it

**** Hermione having questionable spellcasting and magical morals is hardly anything new. See: Rita Skeeter and the bug jar, stolen polyjuice potion ingredients and illegal brewing and basically assaulting Crabbe & Goyle, Hermione in general. Edit: also, once again, romance! Inexperienced 16 year olds with a crush are stupid about it, who would have thought?

Snape was also a death eater, you realise? And the crimes of the father shouldn't necessarily transfer to the son. There's a difference between a regular bigot and someone who actually goes out with a gun. Both are bad, but not comparable. Sure, Draco's dad is a Death Eater. Draco himself is a sixteen year old kid that's also a bigot due to his environment, but most 16 year old bigots aren't going to /kill/ for their bigotry, even if they do talk a lot of shit, and signing up for the Death Eaters obviously entails actual murder. If everyone who talked shit actually acted on it, the world would be much more unpleasant. It's reasonable to doubt Harry's strange obsessions and paranoia.

I see you haven't mentioned the teenage crushes that are normal for teenagers again?

And finally, no, he really wasn't that forthcoming. Also, calling it an annotated textbook is a riot. Stop kidding yourself. The prince's book is as much a simple annotated potions text as a full game walkthrough with mods is an instruction manual. There's a difference between learning from your friend's normal notes with a couple of clarifications (and actually trying to /learn/) and following a genius's hacked, modded, utterly changed potions recipes (without trying to learn and simply copying for the mark, because we don't see Harry ever trying to learn the theory behind the modifications, which really renders your point about him learning null and void) and trying to pass it off as legitimate.

****** Yes, and Hermione traps her in a bug jar for a couple of days without really considering food or drink. Rita's got a poison pen and is a sensationalist writer, and Hermione inadvertently commits torture. Is there a need to compare who's worse than the other? Two actions can /both be bad/. Good people can do bad things to bad people, and it can still be /bad/.

Interesting how you justify the theft and the assault like that. Once again, good people can do bad things, and even if they're generally kind or upright or not bigots, it's still theft and assault. "He bragged about it, so I went and beat up his friends and spied on him!!" is hardly a defense, which readers should be able to see, not being 11-year-olds like the trio is in that story.

Yes, she liked Ron and he was losing. Sure, it's not sensible. They're 16, hormonal, going through their first relationships (1.5 at best if you count Krum, for Hermione), and in possession of magical deathsticks of power. Hermione also had a toilet breakdown after Ron spoke mean words to her in 1st year, is basically the odd one out of her dorm mates, and is shown absconding in tears/upset (like the bird incident you mentioned) a couple of times in the series, so she's hardly as confident as you make her out to be. Hell, why would she have reason to be confident? Ron tried to ask her out as a /last resort/ date for the Yule Ball, thinking "Right, Hermione's a /girl/! And there's /no way/ SHE has a date!"

Anyone can say that they're turning and becoming a spy, but do you think Harry and his friends trusted "Snape the spy" when they were on the run and Snape was headmaster? Do you think any of the students resisting the Death Eaters at Hogwarts believed him? No, they really didn't. Harry's had a feud with Draco ever since he refused that handshake, and Harry also acts rashly and paranoidly (which is the /entire climax of book 5/, btw; if he stopped to think and use the mirror instead of being paranoid and jumping to action, Sirius would still be alive). Sometimes Harry's right about things, and sometimes he's very very wrong, and believing all his random inclinations is madness.

The book itself is a cheat, not cheat/ing/, but the way Harry uses it makes it cheating, and the issue you mentioned was Hermione getting on Harry's case for /using it/. Neville is painted as an absolute idiot in potions, so comparing Harry (pretty average) to the bottom of the barrel is hardly fair.

#+begin_quote
  If say, Harry had taken the book, and found out WHY these instructions are better, and then followed them, no one could have complained and been in the right.
#+end_quote

Ah, but he didn't bother to learn, so that's an irrelevant if statement. Also, Harry's still using someone else's old property and custom recipes without their permission.

******* A good bit of Death Eaters had to became such when they were 16 and 17. So, no, it's not reasonable that she didn't believe Malfoy could be one.

Yes, because Harry opened the package that Sirius was being all mysterious about and at no point did Sirius act like an arrogant idiot while dueling his Bellatrix. Their two deaths aren't paralleled at all.

If he doesn't open it, it's his fault. That's just another oversight to add to the list. I don't see how this proves me wrong?

That i was saying was Harry's failing. Harry offered to share it with Hermione, who could have at least told him to learn from it, rather than get on his case about it. As for the old property, it was left in the spare books in the classroom and given to him by a teacher. Sure it was a little dodgy when he swapped covers for the book and then it became dodgy, but better writing would have had him copy out all the notes into the book.

Harry was dumb as fuck in book 5 sure between the end of it and not finding a way to deal with umbridge and instead pointlessly getting tortured, but Book 6 where the world knows Voldemort is back, and has someone that is a known bigot with known Death Eater family who were recently in raids and had previously threatened someone with a Werewolf threaten someone with a bare forearm (again, fear of forearms is not a real thing) Malfoy might as well have been wearing a shirt that said "So I'm a Death Eater? What are you going to do about it?" and to be fair no one else in book 5 said "Harry you have a fucking communications mirror USE IT YOU DUMBASS" so it's not JUST Harry's fault.

******** Yes, but since he didn't actually learn from it, I think it's fair to consider it a cheat. Learning lets you do it yourself and understand it all, but take away the book, and Harry's back to being average at potions. He's not shown trying to understand squat. In any case, the Prince's book is like bringing as much of an answer key as you can get into a practical exam. It's more than just a little dodgy.

Harry could have taken his concerns to a reasonable adult. Frankly, I can't recall if he did because it's been a while, sorry, but either way, the end result was that they didn't care. He's got private lessons with Dumbledore /about/ Tom Riddle and his whole cause. And if Dumbledore doesn't think it's worth caring about...well, why should Hermione assume that Harry knows better?

**** You really seem to mistake my point. I'm not saying Hermione did none of that -- rulebreaking, fearmongering, etc., because she /did/ -- but I'm saying that other characters (her friends) /also/ did it all, and so they would be hypocrites to call her out as just being "/so lame this year!!!/" for it, like the OP wants.

#+begin_quote
  He was an asshole to Parvati, but he didn't attack Cedric, Dean, Cho, or Ginny with birds.
#+end_quote

OP's point was actually about Hermione "pining like a lovesick puppy", which you seem to have missed. Cedric, Dean, Cho, and Ginny also never tried to take Harry as a last minute date to the Yule Ball like "hey, Harry, I've realised you're actually a man, so go with me, won't you? There's no way you've got a date, after all!"

Edit: also, wasn't the bird attack with Crookshanks in 3rd year, unless I'm mistaken? That was really before any romance; they were /13/.
