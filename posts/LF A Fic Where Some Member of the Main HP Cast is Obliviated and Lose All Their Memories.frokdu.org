***** Posted another one too. At my main comment there's an AO3 link and then this one in ffn. These are the best ones so far.

Edit: Well... about the eyes.... idk. Started to get over some stuff like this and ignore a few minor ones cuz of the necessity to read more fanfics.

****** Ah thanks.

I read the entire fic, and although the first few episodes were bad, it improves a lot near the end.

******* Yeah. Sometimes the first few chapters are shitty in some fics but thats probably cuz it takes a while for some people to get a hang on the story. Totally worth it in the end.

** Not sure where to find it now cause I think the author removed it from ffn due to someone plagiarizing her work but it was called Daphne's Surprise. Daphne is obliviated of her memories of her relationship with harry. Later in the story someone obliviates harry and leaves him in an alley. He still thinks hes an 11year old and is hiding from the dursleys

** Not what was requested but there was a Stargate crossover where Sirius is hit with a memory destroying curse that wiped his mind of all information including his history, his skills, basically everything except motor skills and language.

** It's unfinished, and I suspect may remain so, but I really like [[http://ishtar.fanficauthors.net/The_Case_of_the_Missing_Wizard/index/][The Case of the Missing Wizard]].

Linkffn(Confusion by Natascope) is a fairly cute one-shot, but doesn't involve a heavy memory loss.

I'm not that fond of linkffn(Fate's Mistake by kb0), but it fits the criterion.

I don't know if you'd consider them members of the "main" cast, but linkffn(Blank Slate by tresmaraudeur) has Harry's parents still living, but more-or-less totally obliviated.

linkffn(One Misfired Spell Later by losthpfanficwriter) has both Harry and Hermione obliviated a number of times. Dumbledore is bashed.

** The Dust of Water has Auror!Harry lose all memories since the Battle of Hogwarts and has to figure out who he is and who he wants to be. Warning, its not a particularly... happy... fic. Also slash if that's an issue for you.

There was another one I read that I can't remember the name of. It was about Hermione losing her memory and waking up to realize she was in a poly relationship with Draco and Blaise and learning how and why she fell in love with them.

  HPDM slash, also HPGW and RWHG. Harry thinks he woke from a deep sleep the day after the Battle of Hogwarts. His friends are the ones who tell him that it's ten years later, that he got cursed while chasing a Dark wizard- and that his memories aren't coming back. COMPLETE.
