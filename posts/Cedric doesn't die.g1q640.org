Hi!

I would like to request for recommendations for a fic where Cedric Diggory doesn't die.

Plus points if you have a Fem! Harry but I don't mind a bit of Harry/Cedric action.

Plot wise, I'm not too picky. As long as someone likes it enough to recommend it, I'm willing to risk it.

Thank you very much in advance.


** Harry Potter and the Blazin Goblet. Cedric becomes one of Harrys best bros, although not a fem harry story and also is just a pure crack fic. Exists only to make the fandom more high. Not the best writing but it doesn't matter because it is bloody hilarious.

Also how to you link fics?

*** On reddit look at [[/u/fanfictionBot][u/fanfictionBot]] it will have a link to instructions for how to use the Bot to link stories (it helps to know which fanfiction site the story exists on).

For those stories that are on "unsupported" sites just click on the "two ring" symbol at the bottom left side of your comment window and enter the url for the story.

  ‘Have you tried everything?' Hermione asked insistently.‘Yes! Every time I get to the cup and Cedric doesn't take it with me I go immediately back to my bed in the morning. But all the times he is with me, he dies and after I fall asleep I return too.'‘I guess it is obvious then, isn't it?' Both Harry and Hermione turned to stare at Ron, who looked at them defensively and shrugged ‘You have to go with Diggory and make sure he survives.'Harry/Cedric - Groundhog day AU

  It didn't matter that Harry fell asleep thinking about a busy Saturday in Diagon Alley, or digging through the attic with his father, Sirius, and Uncle Remus. It didn't matter that he went to bed with a stomach full of warm food, or that his mother tucked him into bed even though he was fourteen and he didn't need it, but she still did it because she loved him and he loved her.None of that mattered; the nightmares still came.--- --- ---How different would the world of Harry Potter be if James and Lily had lived?  Ships not listed because I am uncertain if they will deviate from canon. Characters added as they appear.
