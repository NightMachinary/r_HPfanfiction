So, Let's take the throwback comments that Harry heard about Slytherin, plus his dislike of Draco Malfoy and up it to the eleventh power while having him grow big on his expectations of going to Gryffindor then have him be instantly sorted in Slytherin... only to then insist on believing he is in Gryffindor and completely ignore anyone who says otherwise.

As a result through his entire Hogwarts career he elaborates progressively more intrinsic and complex ways of getting into class by his ‘correct' class-schedule, sidestepping the teachers exasperated insistences on the lie that he may somehow not be in Gryffindor and the most important, getting to play Quidditch for his actual house.

The professors, including Dumbledore grow more exasperated and bewildered by the day, except for Snape who boarded the same ‘Deny Reality until it goes away' train-wagon as Harry.


** That's hilarious. Snape and Harry teaming up to prove Harry belongs in Gryffindor only to realize they actually get along quite well over the 7 years would be a fecking amazing crack fic.

** “Severus please-”

“No Albus, it's too late, There is nothing to be done.” The potion's master barked as he stormed out of the headmasters office. Said headmaster becoming suddenly spry as he sprinted down the steps to catch up to the resident potions master.

“My dear boy you have spent the entirety of the last war acting as a spy, you saw the horror's that went on with those who served Tom-surely you of all people can see-”

“One act can change a lifetime Albus, and what has transpired within the last twenty minutes makes the dark lord's choices seem like child's play-”

“For goodness sake Severus!” The headmaster spoke with rare exasperation before jumping in front of the black clad man and poking him in the chest.

“/Liking the same dessert as Harry Potter/ is not an excuse to /change sides!/”

** So, I started writing about how this premise would work better with Ron, what with his pent-up ambition that we see in the Mirror of Erised. Then, I realised that the most Slytherin of Weaselys is /Percy/.

The story could be told in a flashback: around OotP, someone---one of the twins, say---ask him how he managed to get sorted into Gryffindor. The story is his answer.

*** That could actually be funny as hell. Percy is in a very Percy-like way being unwittingly obtuse about his sorting while the teachers try their hardest to make him understand that ‘no, you were /not/ sorted in Gryffindor mister Weasley' all the while his parents are confused since he is swearing that he is in Gryffindor while the teachers say otherwise (I think they would be inclined to at least seriously consider Percy's story since he isn't the lying sort) and Snape is absolutely /not/ helping since he keeps behaving as of Percy was in Gryffindor from the beginning. I can see things coming to a head right before Harry's first year when the teachers just collectively throw their arms up in frustration and officially change Percy's house... only for the new first years to take it as a precedent and tacitly permission to change house any time they want driving the professors crazy by changing houses for ‘a better view',, ‘get away from memories of a failed relationship', ‘keep an eye on a student who owns me money'... Hell, it could even drive then to scrap the house system altogether.
