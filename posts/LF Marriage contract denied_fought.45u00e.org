Hey guys,

I am looking for some fanfiction to read again, this time denied/not accepted/fought marriage contracts caught my fancy!

I'd like it best if it's Harry centric, not Harry/Ginny (sorry, don't like that pairing because I don't exactly like her!), no (main character) slash (no problem with minor-/background-chracter slash!)

So, constraints in place, the stage is yours, guys!


** *Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution*, linkffn(10595005), is the poster fic for fighting marriage laws.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

****** In our society it is (though: Policies change...I mean let's say that 90% of a countries population is whipped out, can't you see politicians making laws like that and maybe making abortion illegal (even after rape) because society might collapse if there's no next generation?), but not necessary in a magical one that seems medieval/victorian at times!

******* The wizarding world does have it's archaic aspects, but forcing people to marry and produce children is just asking for mass deflection or an uprising.

On the population dying out, do know how many dystopian books are out there with similar scenarios? One would hope by such a time, that forcing marriage and giving birth to as many children as possible would go in and out of our thoughts as not going to happen. Perhaps we would learn that having such a huge population was actually a bad thing. It would depend on those in charge.

Hypothetical issues aside, what I was getting at in the first place, was that I found fault with your logic about Harry not wanting children due to his past abuse and what studies have shown us. Harry basically defies what we know. With the Harry we know, settling down to have kids is exactly what his heart has yearned for, which for a time, he didn't think he would live past 17.

******** I agree that our population should be smaller - not only in developing countries, but also in western countries (but politicians don't agree, they didn't plan for this, so they need people to pay taxes otherwise the system will collapse - particularly in Germany where the current working population pays the retirement benefits of those who've left the workforce (either because of age or because they can't work anymore for various reasons)) - I think half the current population would be ideal (with more and more automation and - in the future! - robots the world would turn into a paradise of sorts)

Sure he defies the norm - but then again: Fanfiction produces A LOT of OC-Harrys (from gay ones to Harrys who join Voldemort to Harrys who don't want to fight to Harrys who tell Dumbledore where to stick it etc. etc. etc.), so why not a Harry who does not want children (or is infertile - maybe because of having Voldemort's soul-piece in him for so long or because of the killing-curse etc. etc. - or has an infertile GF (Harry doesn't strike me as a person who'd leave someone for so petty a reason...he might look into adoption, sure, but he'd not leave his GF just because of something she probably had no control over))

*** Very good and it's a very Hermione-Solution (I mean I always thought of her as a "Feminist" (not a radical one, but one agreeing with first and second wave Feminism) or a humanist. I always thought she'd rather do research etc. than be a broodmare (much less married to Ron "I am a fucking slacker" Weasley...sorry, I just don't like him!) - note: That's not a dig against parents in general, I just thought that not having children (or doing so in her 30's - much like muggles in academia!) would fit her really well!) as I think she would never compromise her own freedom (she's quite principled and would probably not compromise them if she could help it...it's one of the reasons why she's got a hard time going against authority, as one of her principles is adherence to books and authority figures!) and ideals just because somebody else told her to!
