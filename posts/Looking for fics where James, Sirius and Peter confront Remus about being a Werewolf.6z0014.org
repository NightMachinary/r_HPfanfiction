Remus' reaction to them finding out and if possible their reaction to finding out that Remus is a Werewolf.

(Doesn't have to have Peter in it, but it's okay if Peter's in it). If any pairings in it slash is fine. Doesn't have to have slash in it. Would love multi chapter dealing with the Marauders learning about Remus being a Werewolf, but if oneshot that's fine.


** I just read against the moon on ffn. Outstanding. Its 800k worss long and still going, and it's remus centered. They are only in 3rd year at this point. Its so good.
