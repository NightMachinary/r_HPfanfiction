** I'll save you time. There aren't many stories of note in that fandom. At least not many that I can think of. Anything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4111486/Anaklusmos14][Anaklusmos14]] is pretty good. Otherwise, the only fic I can recommend is a Gamer fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697391/1/Percy-Jackson-and-the-Game][Percy Jackson and the Game]].

** If you end up liking the Percy Jackson gamer fic you should give his Harry Potter crossover a try. Its not mind blowing but its pretty interesting.\\
Edit: by his I mean the author of the gamer fic.

  Percy looked her over and nodded. She seemed to be about his age, a hair shorter than him, but way more confident. He finally put the skateboard down. “I'm Percy.” He said. “Annabeth,” She sighed, “It's great to see a face that isn't dead and trying to eat me.” Percy managed a weak laugh, “Yeah it is.”

  At seventeen, Percy never assumed that his life would be consumed of anything other than swimming and late night study sessions locked in his room. However, his entire view changes once the world seems to turn against the human race and disease, famine, and chaos engulf the country. But Percy's not one to give up so easily, and apparently neither is the blonde girl he teams up with. So when the opportunity survive announces itself to Percy and Annabeth, they don't hesitate to take it.
