Did order of the pheonix did anything worth in the canon against Voldemort during 5th and 6th year under Dumbledore? If it did, what are they, I mean other than guarding Harry and the Prophecy.


** Unfortunately, not much aside from acting as living punching bags.

Their information gathering capabilities isn't all that successful. Remus doesn't rally the werewolves against Voldemort, and they don't seem to gain any additional allies.

As a fighting force they're meh at best. Kingsley takes out two Death Eaters in the Battle of the DOM and a handful of DE during Harry's extraction, but thats the bulk of their success. The Order fared worse than the DA, with Tonks, Moody and Kingsley all going down, Sirius dying and only Remus escaping unharmed, and the Order are all overage witches and wizards too.

Aberforth outright concedes defeat at one point in time in DH by saying the Order of the Phoenix is finished. So yeah, walking heavy bags for the Death Eaters seems to be accurate unfortunately.

This. Characters like Dumbledore, Snape, McGonagall, and Kingsley color our perspectives. Fan fiction further hypes up characters like Bill, Tonks, Remus, and Mad Eye, who was probably better than who I lumped him with but still a retired, disabled wizard with extreme paranoia.

The Order is really just a group of witches and wizards willing to stand up and fight. And the best of the group died/were incapacitated before '82 or were picked off before DH got started. Most of them anyway.

**** Moody is an interesting case. He's the first to go down during the battle in the DOM to Dolohov, yet Voldemort still targeted him first believing him to be the biggest threat.

The Order not putting up much of a fight is one of my pet peeves with the series. Even after Voldemort died the Death Eaters still have a co-opted Ministry and the Order suffered tremendous casualties. With Harry outright saying that he holds the allegiance to the Elder Wand any surviving Death Eater can simply grab Ginny/Ron/Hermione as leverage to force him to give it up or just kill off any Order members due to having a co-opted Ministry on their side.

Order/Ministry casualties in second war.

- Snape, Sirius, Tonks, Dumbledore, Remus, Scrimgeour, Fred, Emmeline Vance, Amelia Bones

- Unknown number of Aurors, leading to Kingsley allowing Ron, Neville and Harry join the Aurors

The Death Eaters have three total casualties that's confirmed. Voldemort, Bellatrix and Peter. The Carrows are captured, but the bulk of Voldemort's forces are still unaccounted for. Rabastan, Rodolphus, Dolohov, Travers, Avery, Selwyn, Jugson, the Notts, Goyle and Crabbe Sr, MacNair aren't confirmed dead or incarcerated, and while some like Dolohov were present in the battle of Hogwarts and taken down, the remnants of the Order still have the Death Eater Ministry to fight even after Voldemort's death, and they're even more shorthanded.

I have to disagree with this. Pius Thicknesse was the Minister and Yaxley was Head of the DMLE. They were both present at the battle and captured/dead. I find it hard to believe they would be there and Nott, Lestrange bros, Crabbe, and Goyle would miss it. There's also mention of those under the Imperius Curse waking up across the country.

I think you're also overestimating the Death Eaters left. Only a few of the best of the 2nd war were unaccounted for and with Voldemort, Bella, and Dolohov out of the way they wouldn't be too much for a group of Order members/Aurors to handle.

He still has his fortunes, and no reason not to slide right back into wizarding politics, because even the 'good' parts of the wizengamot are hopelessly conservative and he never changed his views on blood supremeacy.

Hell, if you go by Cursed Child he spent most of the time after the fall of Voldemort buying up dark artefacts from the other Death Eaters' estates at firesale prices after throwing them under the bus and testifying against them.

***** There is a bit of an observer bias here. Harry knows and cares about every single Order member, but he only knows a small fraction of of Death Eaters and isn't going to keep track of what happens to them, so of course the casualty list will be lopsided.

We know that, for example, Neville and Sprout threw screaming mandrakes---a deadly weapon with an area of effect---off the Hogwarts walls. How many did they get? Harry didn't see, and so neither did we.

Similarly, almost all Ministry officials who were actual true believers were at the Battle of Hogwarts. The rest were just going along with the prevailing regime. Once the news would reach them that Voldemort was dead and that the Order had prevailed, they would pretend that they were on the side of the angels all along.

And, while Harry telling everyone that he was the master of the Elder Wand may not have been the smartest thing, taking a hostage won't guarantee a victory. Heck, maybe Harry /will/ pull the trigger. Maybe someone else will pull the trigger. And, since said hostage-taker is probably a Slytherin, he or she is probably not that eager to die for a hopeless cause---that's more of a Gryffindor thing.

I mean, it wasn't the entirely successful, but in the end the operation did alright, I'd say. Voldemort didn't hear the prophecy, a bunch of death eaters were captured, and Voldemort was exposed. Perhaps not quite what they were aiming at, but still.

Negatives were of course Sirius dying, Arthur getting hurt, and probably more that I don't remember.

I think it's also likely that most of the Order's activities, like recruiting, counter intelligence etc were unknown to Harry, and thus the reader.

***** I feel like Dumbledore's real plan there was always to force Voldemort to go after it in person, providing the perfect opportunity to reveal his existence, the guards were to try and stop death eaters, unfortunately Harry decided to believe the visions from Voldemort rather than use the magic mirror he'd been given and messed it all up.

****** I never understood this plot line.

Dumbledore's plan is to lure Voldemort himself into showing up? Ok, fine. The prophesy is enchanted so only Harry and Voldemort can pick it up. Do nothing, Voldemort will show up eventually.

The guards were to stop death eaters? They can't do anything with it. They can walk up to the shelf and not pick it up, what's the point?

Yes, Harry fucked things up, but shouldn't have been an issue anyway. What's the prophesy tell Voldemort? That Harry is his nemesis. He knows this already.

The entire plot of OOTP exist to make the Order and the Ministry look incompetent and give Voldemort a full year to gather strength before open warfare.

** We have to remember that the books are from Harry's POV. And for the vast majority of the series, the Order isn't talking to Harry. Any successes they have, Harry doesn't hear about. Harry notices when bad things happen.

You kinda have to read between the lines of Deathly Hollows. Potterwatch interviews Fred, Remus and Kingsley, openly proclaiming them to be Order members. They give news and survival tips. When the Order arrives at Hogwarts just before the battle, everyone seems to know who they are and Kingsley takes charges. This implies there's activity Harry doesn't know about. Even Aberforth, someone that proclaimed the Order dead and the war a lost cause, has been active helping Neville and the rest of the DA.

The Order is unfortunately made up of about a dozen people fighting a terrorist organization that the government refuses to acknowledge even exist.

He did land himself a vacation in Chateau Azkaban, though, and for six months! How did the Death Eaters know they were even there, and then they /still/ stuck to the older plan and then Arthur was almost murdered by a mad snake. That just reeks of incompetence. Oh, Remus and Tonks were spying on a Death Eater's house, how much do you wanna bet he already knew they were there? The first order seemed much more competent than the second order.

Fred and George are very creative and could make exciting products for Order's aid, but nothing of the sort ever happens.

Their plan to convince giants failed because the Death Eaters were pro-active and didn't care about morality and just decided to kill the Leader and elected a new Leader who believes them. Werewolfs were already aligned with Greyback - did the Order just decided to kill a very well known criminal and disgusting human being? Nah, even if it would've been very legitimate to send a squad of wizards to kill or permanently incapacitate Greyback, they do nothing.

At the end of the day, their loss was inevitable. They were far too passive and inactive while the Death Eaters kept picking them one by one.

** Hard to say as we only saw the order through Harry's eyes, of whom the order was deliberately trying to keep away.

We know that at OOTP the order was playing at least three roles in to prepare for the war besides having set a safe-house (Grimald Palace), namely trying to form alliances (thus Hagrid and Remus negotiating with the giants and werewolves -from which we can infer that there was at least some effort in the front of recruiting other wizards, and I think Bill said something about negotiating with Goblins), guarding Harry/the Prophecy and spying on the DE's (thus they knowing what Voldemort was doing, and getting some use out of Snape beyond needless antagonism).

Other than it, considering the political climate and the members we can speculate on some other things they may have done, but we just don't know for sure. They had at least three Aurors being two of them active and one retired, Arthur Weasley (in a position high enough to have a reason to be told things while still being mostly overlooked), both of them imply a certain amount of spying on the ministry and even influencing it from inside (Moody almost certainly had old-friends still in the force who he could talk to get more restricted information while Kingsley and Tonks would be apar of the day-to-day goings of the department and Arthur would be in a position good to cover the civilian side of the proceedings with the official information given to him, the inevitable gossiping going around and even peeks at documents not made public, to say nothing of the influence they could exert by misfiled or lost forms, ‘finding' documents that no one knew about, convincing some coworkers to not try so hard in this or that investigation/document...).

We also have Bill as a curse breaker and (probably) warder (Yeah, I know the term is not cannon, but he was capable of using the fidelius and possibly other defensive enchantments, so this is still usable), Severus Snape that was a potioner and knowledgeable on the Dark arts (and even healing to an extent) plus Dumbledore who was said to know a lot about all things magic. Just with them we also have a quick response team to find, acquire and safely remove the curse on cursed objects (like the locket which almost killed Katie Bell) and cure those affected by them, plus a possible team capable of invading DE's houses (we know that Voldemort did murder some people in that year by using dangerous plants, cursed items wouldn't be much of a stretch), and even possible creating more safe-houses for order members (though admittedly it would open the plot-hole of why these safe-houses weren't used later on).

And this are just the members I know the name and jobs from the top of my head, the order had the potential to make a great deal behind the scenes, they could for example work on getting refugees out of the country (werewolves that didn't want to be involved for example).
