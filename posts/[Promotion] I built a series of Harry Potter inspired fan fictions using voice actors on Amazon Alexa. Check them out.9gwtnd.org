Hey everyone, I built a series of Harry Potter inspired fan fictions for kids using voice actors and sound effects on Amazon Alexa.

I've received great feedback for them so far but I would love it if I could hear what you all think!

The story is called "Wizard Quest", so after starting, just say "Alexa, Wizard Quest" and you'll be on your way :).

If you do not have an Amazon Echo, you can still try it out on your phone if you are in the United States and download the Amazon Alexa app.

If you are a parent, I think your kids will love it!

Excited to hear what you all think!
