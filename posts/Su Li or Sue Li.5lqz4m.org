I'm writing a Ravenclaw Harry fic with her as a secondary character, and I'm wondering what name I should use. I remember her as Su from older fanfics, but she must have become a Sue at some point because that's what HP Wikia says now.

** According to this shot of Rowling's Notes, it is Su

** HP Wikia is unreliable. Not only are there numerous mistakes but they mix and match book canon, film canon and game canon.

The only reliable English-language secondary source is HP Lexicon.

** Oriental naming doesn't use an e after u, so I believe it's Su Li

** I think you could go both ways. Su Li is a more oriental name, but as history has shown, at times parents alter their child's names upon immigration or if having them in a new country to better fit the environment.

Think of an immigrant coming to America and then having a child and giving them a more American sounding or looking variation of their culturally influenced name (just an example.. i realize HP is Britain)

So Su... becomes Sue. That said, I am fairly sure Rowling intended it to be Su Li.

** I've always thought her name was akin to Michelle Yeoh's character in "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon." Yu Shu Lien

** Just googled it and while the English Wikipedia just mentioned that Sue was a shorthand of Susan, Susanna and various variation thereof. The Norwegian one was slightly more helpful. Sue is a western form of various Asian names with similar pronunciation.

So, both are technically correct. It depends on whether you're including the Magical Orient Express in your story or not I suppose.

*** But that's like saying Steven and Stephen are both correct. When it comes to a specific person's name, there is a "right" way to spell their name, regardless of how many alternate versions there may be. JKR wrote the name as Su Li and so that's the correct spelling.

**** I said technical, not actual. And Steven vs Stephen is different as they're both western names.

And, Rowling's been doing some extensive overhaul of HP canon with Pottermore. Wouldn't surprise me if she did change a characters name too, to be honest.
