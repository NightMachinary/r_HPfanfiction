** In Linkffn(Oh God, Not Again!) Harry understands Dumbledore, but still trolls him with his refuge in audacity.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

*** Oh god, not again may be the redo fic with a believable reaction on Harry's part. He gets mad, gets over it. He asks for help. And he's crazy. All good things.

I think it went haywire only when the space stuff got involved.

** linkffn(13010260) The Second String is great. Harry travels back to the mid 70s. Dumbledore isn't evil in it, he's just a man who's in charge of a war and doesn't necessarily have the time or ability to think of every individual under him when he has to think about the greater costs at stake. When I read it, I found that it neither justified nor vilified him, but tried to make his position and actions understandable. (Not completed, but recently updated.)

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in the past, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. A new perspective on the 1970s time travel genre. Updates weekly on Saturdays. Some slash much later.

*** I like that one two. It only lost me with the gay pirate stuff and the fact that the story barely ties in with canon at all.

**** I mean, I had fun with that. I've seen enough canon rehash time travel that something in a completely different period with characters who aren't explored as much is interesting to me.

***** Alright then... Personally I do not see what the sense in time travel is if you cannot prevent the terrible tragedies of your loved ones. Might be that I'm just frustrated because I've never read a good time travel fic in this fandom.

****** I mean, in a sense, Harry's loved ones haven't been born yet (and the ones who have act very differently because it's 20+ years before he knew them in canon and also he's not the Chosen One to them). He also knows nothing about horcruxes or even the prophecy because he time travels before his fifth year. He doesn't know why his family was targeted or why he survived the killing curse, so there's not really a sense of urgency in that for him yet. I have a gut feeling that's going to change soon, after Ab's death and with whatever consequences there are of him coming out as a wizard.

But yeah, I understand the feeling. I think I'm more interested in exploring areas of the world/history of HP that we don't see in canon.

  AU. Harry, Ron, and Ginny send themselves back in time to avoid the destruction of everything they hold dear, and the deaths of everyone they love.

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.

author summary:

“(aka 'how to survive endless rebirth with your so-called soulmate')

Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth.

At some point, they stopped caring and just started fucking with people.

(cracky humor with a hint of seriousness and plot, my specialty)”
