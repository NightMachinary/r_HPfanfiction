I only remember the last chapter, in which Susan Bones is the MoM and is in a meeting with Harry and Daphne. Harry had widespread the Elixir of life wchich made wizards live much longer but muggles who consumed it all died.


** Was Harry's brother there too? In that case it'd be linkffn(Yes, I am Harry's Brother)

*** How prominent is Tonks in this fic? She's listed as the only other character in the summary, but OP mentions that it is Harry/Daphne.

**** The MC is Harry's brother(impersonated by voldemort) who is dating Tonks, so she is one of the main cast. Harry ends up with DG but has different relationships throughout the book. Harry is written as prominently as the protagonist, so no sorry about him being on the sidelanes.
