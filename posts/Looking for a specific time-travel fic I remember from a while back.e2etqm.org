:END:
I think it was about time travel- with Harry traveling back in time to his first year to re-do everything.

I remember a very specific scene in which Harry was ice-skating somewhere near the Burrow and I think Ginny or someone else fell through the ice, so Harry had to use his advanced magical abilities (which he'd been hiding from everyone) to save them. . .

Anyone know what story I'm talking about? Thanks :)
