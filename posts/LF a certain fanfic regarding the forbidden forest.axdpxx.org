I don't remember much, but I do remember something about the Forbidden Forest being dangerous- the trees were alive, and an old headmaster had been killed by them, and his portrait was insane. Harry thought he wasn't human or something like that.

  DH disregarded. Damaged by the war, Harry flees everything that used to be familiar to him and instead roams the night, haunted by unsolvable questions -- what truly killed Voldemort? And what lurks in the Forbidden Forest, where the trees seem alive?
