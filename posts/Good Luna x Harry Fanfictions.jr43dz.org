Luna Lovegood is one of my favourite characters, and after reading The Peculiar Life of Luna Lovegood, I'm curious as to what other Luna x Harry ships are out there. Any suggestions?

P.S. Please avoid unnecessary bashing. Unless it serves to ultimately better a character and develop their arc, it can be extremely uncomfortable to read. Just because Harry isn't with Ginny doesn't mean she's a deranged, money-hungry hooker.


** - “Protection From Nargles“ and “Harry and Luna Against the High Inquisitor” by Arpad_Hrunta linkao3(567400;568303)

- “The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel” linkao3(14078862) and its sequels

- I actually liked even “Help of a Seer by Aealket” linkffn(7548963), even though Luna is a seer there. It is well written.

  Harry and Luna meet in the Room of Requirement. Mistletoe appears. Will Nargles be a problem? Takes place in during Harry's fifth year, as he and Luna get closer. Basically pure fluff, largely consisting of conversations.

Together, they fight bigotry and corruption, while Luna learns what it means to Feel, and Love. Luna sets out to fulfill her mothers work and change the world as we know it forever...that is if she can live long enough!

  For his 21st birthday, Luna has a surprise gift. And it's nothing Harry could have ever expected or predicted. Then again, nothing about living with beautiful weirdo Luna Lovegood is ever predictable, is it? Post-war Harry. "Be a freak like me too," Luna whispers. Story about PTSD, abusive childhood, and letting go of the past. COMPLETE!

#+begin_quote
  Harry knew Luna well...didn't he. This is a little oneshot, featuring what could have been on the night of Horace Slughorn's Christmas Party. There are no lemons, but there is a rather intense discussion of more mature themes. Just a little lighthearted snippet, with spades of fluff, along with a bit of humour (I hope?). Harry x Luna This is not stolen, read the Author's Note.

#+begin_quote
  Harry doesn't expect to enjoy his fifth year back at Hogwarts, and would just as soon be alone on the train... but a few hours with a certain blonde Ravenclaw may have an unexpected effect. A "what-if" variant, grounded in canon, but also inviting you to explore the possibilities. For anybody who appreciates H/L as friends and/or a potential couple.
