I'm familiar with some of it, but it's from a long time ago and I no longer remember the titles. If it's not too much, I'd rather not have straight pairings relevant to the story.. I don't mind slash.

Thank you in advance


** - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance][Resonance trilogy]] (W: 1,713,423; Abandoned) --- has its Idiot Balls and develops slowly at times, but generally isn't bad, [[/s][potential spoiler]];
- [[http://reddit-hpff.wikia.com/wiki/The_Sacrifices_Arc][The Sacrifices Arc]] (W: 3,075,741; Complete) --- has well-developed characters, contains Harry/Draco slash in the later books, has several major Idiot Ball moments, [[/s][potential spoiler]];

This story has its silly moments but it fits your request and isn't too bad to scratch out of recommendations.

*** Great writing. I'm starting the second story in the Sacrifices Arc but I have to ask - am I supposed to like Connor or their parents for that matter?

I love that Harry is infallible in this story. It's rare to have a Harry that makes mistakes, recognizes that fact, doesn't whine and just moves on.

The narrative is the biased reflection of Harry's perspective on things. So if, for instance, the narrator describes how pure and divine phoenixes are, I'd say it means that /Harry/ has this evaluation about phoenixes.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3736151/1/Better-Be-Slytherin][Better Be Slytherin!]] is one of my favourites. Snape doesn't immediately warm up to Harry, and it has things I've never seen in any other fanfic, which is rare outside of straight-up AUs.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6730432/1/World-in-Pieces][World in Pieces]]: AU after the last chapter of DH. Harry gets pulled into another universe to deal with the problem of Voldemort there. But that is not the worst thing that could happen. Mostly gen, with Snape mentoring Harry. COMPLETE.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3389525/1/Stronger-Than-Hope][Stronger than Hope]]: AU after OoTP, a few HBP details. An obsessed, grieving Harry has decided on a dangerous way to defeat Voldemort. Snape is paying closer attention than before, but his contempt for Harry blinds him. Eventual Snape as Harry's guardian story. COMPLETE

Both interesting and well written stories, from what I remember.
