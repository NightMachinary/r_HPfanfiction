Obviously criticism will always be a part of writing no matter how good your story actually is. And that's okay because everyone has different tastes and the point is to actually improve. Despite that logic though, criticism can hurt or at least sting whether it's constructive or inflammatory.

So as a writer of fanfiction, how do you deal with it? How do you let it not demotivate you? It's not like any of us are getting paid here. So what keeps you going? I admire people who can just brush it off, but for those of us who are more sensitive, I'm sure some advice would he helpful!


** I may be a minority opinion, but I love harsh constructive criticism. My favorite type of reviews are those that tell me how much I need to improve in my writing. I especially think harsh reviews are needed sometimes to deflate the ego I get from FFN reviews. I think what's important is realizing that when people give concrit, they actually cared about your story. They've spent enough time and effort to come up with a review when they could have easily ignored it and moved on. I think realizing that was what made me truly thankful for those who are giving harsh feedback. Worst case, they were invested enough in your story to feel disappointed.

As for inflammatory/trolling reviews, I generally don't care. I mean, I've probably heard worse things in the internet. Besides, it helps if you think that it increases your review count at the end XD

*** In posting poetry online, I find that harsh and very critical (but constructive) comments motivate me just as much as really positive reviews, sometimes even more so.

Especially those comments that are really good at pointing out exactly what they think could be improved. It just makes me so excited, because I'll be able to use those tips for all the new stuff that I write. It helps so much.

** As someone working in the creative industry I'm somewhat "battle-hardened", I'd say. Its one thing to receive criticism, its another thing if that criticism could cost you your monthly paycheck.

I think its important to understand something crucial before you read criticism. /Nobody/ is objective and there are as many opinions out there as there are humans. With that realization another comes right around the corner: You cannot please everybody. Period. As a matter of fact, if you please everybody, you please no one, least of all yourself. And for a last point: You share much of your taste with others. Use your own sense of whats good and whats bad to build something /you/ like. Others will like it as well, I promise. But if you don't like what you do, why should others?

When it comes to dealing with criticism, I always try to remain professional and pragmatic. I don't do it for my fics, but for my other work I make it a point to ask for the Ws. Why didn't you like this development? What would you've done? Where would you place this? and so on and so on. Dealing with criticism is a lot like dealing with fear (Depending on whom you ask it may even be the same thing). Understanding it is the crucial part of using it for your own gain.

Then of course, try to read criticism while giving the critics the benefit of the doubt. Especially online you have people from all around the world. Often enough, many of them and a lot of native speakers do not find the right words. What they end up writing may sound insulting, but key here is to remind yourself that very few actually want to do that. Use their input, evaluate it and take from it what you can.

The only thing you'll just have to weather for yourself is the demotivation. Making Art is a brutal business. Creative processes bring forth something from deep within us. You have a love for the HP universe, so you use it to tell a story. That speaks of a passion for this source material. Publishing it... that takes courage. You're offering the world something that started within you and that came not just from your mind, but from your heart and soul. People not liking it hurts - a lot. Dealing with it is not something people on here can help you a great deal with. But heed this advice: Remind yourself of your passion, your drive. And maybe print out some good criticism - that helps too.

** I had my first proper criticism recently, and it hurt. It wasn't something I could fix, it was just someone not liking my new story as much as my old one. I had a little cry (my reaction to anything, unfortunately), reminded myself that I'm writing for me, not anyone else, and moved on. Of course I was demotivated at first, and I can be sensitive.

But, you said it yourself, we're not being paid here. We don't owe anyone anything. If it's something you can fix, or work on (i.e, if the criticism is constructive), then great! Definitely try to take it on board because it's satisfying watching your writing improve. But if you can't, or don't want to... At the end of the day, it's fanfic, and we do this because we love the source material. So if you feel like you've lost your motivation, go back to where you got it in the first place, and read the books again!

** It depends.

Is someone objectively pointing out plot holes and weak characterizations? Then I welcome it with open arms, no matter how harshly the feedback is worded.

Is the reviewer simply butthurt that I'm not catering to their subjective personal tastes? Even if it's respectfully rendered, I do my best to tear the reviewer to shreds.

** I've had my share of pretty harsh criticism. I hated it at first, I wondered what the point of writing even was. I would get petty--I'd check out stories by whoever it was that had criticised me, and think to myself that they weren't any better.

It's only when you start trying to use the criticism that I think it starts to make sense. I analyzed it, I asked myself how I would write a story that would not be subject to that criticism, while still being the story I wanted to tell. I'm still far from great, but I've improved.

Ultimately, as you said, we're not getting paid. We (or at least I) write for our own enjoyment, and there's some strange sense of joy in things that are just done really well. I could write out a hundred thousand words in a month, but I would much rather write half of that and make sure that it's done well, that I can read it back and go: "I want to know what happens next."

Of course, it's my story. I do know what happens next: I keep writing.

Edit: of course, this refers to /constructive/ criticsm. The one I got was: "cut out at least half your adjectives. Nothing happens in this chapter, it's just useless description." If someone reviews your story and they go: "This story is stupid, you're stupid and you look stupid," they're not worth your time.

** If a stranger on the internet offers valid complaints about my work, most of the time, I already know about the problem and agree. (And I publish anyway because what else can I do? I'm not going to rewrite it over and over until it's good; I have to get things finished eventually.)

I don't trust positive reviews, and I rather expect reviews to be targeted toward other potential readers, not me.

** I don't think there /is/ much useful advice. In the end, it boils down to 'be a different person'. Be rational, not emotional, and be self-assured, not self-concious.

If you are, you realise words on the internet can't hurt you, and you can take criticism of whatever form, filter out the useful parts, apply it to you, and improve. The last part goes for criticism anywhere in life.

So the question then is, probably, how to improve confidence and how to act rationally, and eh ... I don't think there's a one-size-fits-all solution.

The funny thing is that the less you'd mind really harsh criticisms, the less you seem to get, at least in my experience. Possibly because confidence is based on competence, so there simply /is/ less to criticise.

** To me, criticism is a big bonus of fanfiction. At this point, only friends and family read my original stuff, fanfiction allows me to test my writing and storytelling skills on a bigger audience than I could ever reach otherwise. Reviews that offer constructive criticism are by far my favourites, and sometimes even lead to interesting conversations and new insights into characters, or the HP world in general. Sometimes they also inspire ideas I wouldn't have thought of otherwise.

Negative criticism can be a downer for a short while, especially if I put a lot of work into the chapter in question, but in the end I either agree and try to do better, or it turns out I prefer my version of things anyway. Especially in the beginning, contradictory criticism was quite confusing. I have a scene in my story from Hermione's POV, and some people like it, some say I didn't do her justice, and others simply despise her character and dislike the scene on principal. So with time I've learned to take criticism concerning certain canon characters with a grain of salt.

About really rude reviews... somebody once told me I'm a loser (and a mudblood :D ) because my characterisation of Harry didn't fulfil their expectations. It was more entertaining than anything else. Not worth getting angry about, in any way, especially as it was written by an anonymous reviewer.

So my advice would be to concentrate on the opportunities the review function offers to you as a writer. There are actually people out there reading your story, who are invested enough to give you feedback for free. They might point out weaknesses, but that gives you the chance to work on that. Someone criticises your grammar and spelling? - You know to double check that before you post the next chapter. Someone doesn't understand why a character is acting a certain way? - Go back and take a look at what motivated your character, written down, things can look quite different than they did in your mind.

Of course that's easier said than done, and not every reviewer should be taken seriously, but I think a positive and open attitude on the writers side can help.

** I wish I'd get more real criticism. I'm quite a perfectionist, and I don't think any of my stories (all one-shots so far except from an Albus/Gellert multichapter about their summer together) so far are up to the standard I'd have as a reader, but I was posting them anyway hoping for some real criticism.

Instead, I've often received praise even in review tag games, but I always think people who praise my stories are either too polite or not looking hard enough. My stories don't really get that many views, so I guess those reviewers are just too polite...

I don't need people telling me something is perfect if I'm well aware it isn't. Many fanfiction.net readers are too easily pleased. I really love constructive criticism, especially on my writing style. I don't like reviewers demanding to change the plot though, like "please make this Dumbledore bashing" or "just send Ariana to St. Mungo's".

*** Hey I took a look at your story. I read the first chapter. I liked the friendship between Elphias and Albus. There were a few typos in the chapter which distracted me a bit. Typos sometimes cause me to stop reading a fic. If you want specifics of all the typos I caught, send me a PM and I can go into more detail. Overall, I did like the opening and it set up the story well.

***** Ah, I have come across this before on fanfiction.net. You should punctuate your dialogue correctly. I generally close the tab if I see full stops instead of commas before the dialogue tag. Now I see that you've corrected it later on, so I'll give it a shot.

** There's been times I've wanted to delete everything, especially after a nasty anon review, but then I tell myself that I was having fun before and why let another person ruin my fun? 9 times out of 10, they're either anon or from a throwaway account with no bio or stories on it so they're probably a troll or bully. At least I have the guts to post my work and review under my penname.

As for concrit reviews, I've learned to accept them more gracefully. I've also learned to stand by my work. The thing is, not all concrit is good advice. I receive a lot through review games / review trades, and some of it can be very contradictory to each other. One person might thing a scene is very emotional and well-done, another might call it over-dramatic. It's one thing to correct grammar or plot holes or weak characterization, but then there comes a point where it's very subjective and sometimes you're going to disagree.

** I've gotten a bit of good criticism in my time, which mainly amounted to, "add more description to your scenes." I can agree with that, too. When I read my own work, most of the time it feels really dry and sparse, but the problem is that adding good description is /really/ hard. And when one of my friends tried to give me advice on this topic, I disagreed with her advice. I don't think adding dialogue tags like, "the green-eyed Gryffindor retorted" is good writing. It's redundant and unnecessarily hard to follow.

Any advice on this? I think it would really help me write faster if I knew how to tackle descriptions.

** I'd rather have one comment outlining exactly why the reader thinks my story is terrible and needs extensive reworking than 100 "love it please write more"s, not going to lie.

If someone's taken the time out to write those things down, think about them. You don't even necessarily have to agree with what the person's said, but if they've actually given criticism, they're trying to help you improve.

Be driven to improve - even if it hurts, what that person has said is extremely valuable, and they've handed you a tool to improve your writing, your characterization, your worldbuilding. Try and ignore any sarcastic tone to it, just break the comment down to the bones and see how you can approach using them constructively.

Sure, it hurts. If it really hurts, go have a cup of tea or a yoghurt, have a nice long shower, read for a bit, distance yourself a little, and then go back and read it again. Try and view the comment and your work objectively if it helps.

And if you have a cry, don't worry about it. I have had many a cry over things that don't matter, and writing is a pretty sensitive hobby. You have to put yourself in your characters' shoes, and a criticism can feel like a personal attack sometimes - but just remember, it's not. You're you, and it's all cool.

If the criticism is insulting, or mocking, then I ignore it. Those people don't want to offer constructive criticism, they are posting for their own audience.

If the criticism boils down to "I don't like this story, write a story I like", or "this is not canon, write canon!" then I ignore it.
