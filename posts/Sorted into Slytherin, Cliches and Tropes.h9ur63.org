So, uh, the tropes I know are...

∆The whole Slytherin solidarity thing.

∆Snape or a Prefect hosts a meeting either after the Welcoming Feast or before breakfast during the first day to lecture the firsties on how they ought to behave.

∆Prefects advice on dealing with inner house conflict is that whatever happens within or among Slytherins stays within Slytherin. There's no trouble so long as they aren't caught.

What are some you've encountered? Do you find them feasible?


** That respect needs to be beaten out of the people around you. Like oh we don't like Harry as slytherin but suddenly beats Draco in a duel and he's won respect!!!

No. They're 11. Draco is going to go cry to his father and continue to pick on Harry and everyone else isn't going to care that two 11 year olds were going at it.

I can see respect being gained through repeated attempts and actual growth later in life though.

*** Makes sense. I always found that concept odd.

** The entire house turns on the MC immediately and, no, I don't find it feasible. It's pretty ridiculous, tbh.

(Your first trope is canon)

*** I think if characters were to turn on the mc, it would be their year mates and those a year above. Other year groups would be indifferent.

** I think you covered the big ones, and no I don't they make sense. Slytherin is a house like any other. It's made up of children who happen to be a bit more ambitious than others. I don't think this would necessitate written rules for how they would conduct themselves while at school. Honestly, anytime a story goes out of its way to say this or that house is way different because Ravenclaws are all super geniuses and Slytherin are child politicians or whatever, it takes me out of the story. They're all just kids, relax about it.

** Larger common room or less people in the dorm or even individual rooms because it's located in the dungeons and not a tower, so there is more space.

The rule for Slytherins to go in groups or pairs to avoid disadvantage in confrontation.

You have to climb up the social ladder and there are actual King and Queen of the house.
