Borgin & Burkes seems like the kind of place where they'd take advantage of the occasional lost child suddenly appearing.

(In the movie, they had him say "Diagonally" instead of "Diagon Alley." In the book, he merely stuttered. I wonder how many people missed the pun before the movie came out.)


** The confused child dropped to the ground as green blast of light hit. Mr. Borgin rubbed his hands together gleefully, "Excellent, I was running a bit low on potion ingredients. DRUSTY!" A terrified house elf popped into the store, took a look at the child and gulped, "Yes, m-master?" Borgin gestured, "Take it away for processing."

*** That would imply that it's either an open conspiracy, in the "everyone knows, but nobody will admit it," since the people in the Floo Control office have to deal with the registrations, or there are a few bad apples in the office who handle a separate "off the books" set of registrations.

**** Erring on the side of simplicity, I would think the Floo office handles the hook-ups but doesn't control the index beyond investigating when complaints come in about subverted destinations. Floo registrars may be able to control their 'Floo address' with a spell which basically answers when someone calls a name into the Floo fire. Perhaps all those other fireplaces a person sees while passing through the Floo are similarly-named and it shows them in case a traveler mumbled.

***** I always thought that the whole "you see other fire places" was either an effect of magical superposition, the physical travel, or of other floo traffic.

Superposition in the sense that when you step into a chimney and use the powder, the magic of the network essentially takes your body and turns it into some magically charged ash, or the green flame. The moment the flame dies down in the entry fireplace, you basically exist inside of the entire floo network at once, before its magic causes the flame that is you to appear at your destination and reconstitute you.

The travel itself in the sense that when you are consumed by the flame, you essentially travel along a network of "nodes" - with every connected fireplace being such a node. As you whirl by, you see the fireplace for a brief moment as it recieves your flame, grabs your destination, and routes you along one of its many connections. In this way, the network is modular and won't break down when some central hub is destroyed, is easily expanded and no fireplace has to know the entire map and therefore be updated every time a new fireplace is added.

And other floo traffic in the sense that there is only one "line" floo runs through - some sort of artifical sub-realm that can channel the floo naturally. In this way, during your travel, you would see other fireplaces activating all over the country, because the network is so widely used.

All three are mutually exclusive, though.

****** I've never seen the "body converted" type of floo used in a story. I've read a number of them where leaving a floo without problems is a matter of practice, and a couple where there's a "trick" involved in not stumbling (that nobody ever bothers to tell Harry).

I've seen stories with disabling of individual floos being done, and one or two where there's a central device (runic crystal or something) that can be used to shutdown the entire system.

The problem with a mesh network that doesn't require local updating is knowing which node connection to use when leaving. If you take random connections out of each fireplace that you pass by/through, travel times would be indeterminate. Perhaps the flames expand through all connections until the correct one is found, at which point everything collapses down into a single chain of connections.

******* Maybe it uses some variety of the point me charm? So it casts the charm while you're in there and then sends you along the line that is closest to where you're travelling?

The phrasing could even be universal, such as "Point Me Current Floo Traveller's Destination".
