I feel like I'm going to die if I don't read any stories

​

Do you have any recommendations for Harry Potter dark fanfiction, with slash?

​

I've read some that he has a brother and is neglected, that he runs away from the Dursleys,kills everyone who sees, goes crazy ...

​

And I was looking for some Tomarry with dark Harry, but most that I find are a little bad or all the same


** I think there's a tomarry subreddit - you might try that or [[/r/HPSlashFic]] I can't really recommend any other than October as it's not my cup of tea. October is... very unique, I'd say, but not really dark.

For a dark/apathetic Harry, you might try Shadow Magic: Harry/Theo.

  AU. Harry was born with a power the Dark Lord knows not: the magic to see into shadows, to walk the shadows, and to send the shadows everywhere. This changes his life rather dramatically.

  It is not paradox to rewrite history, in the breath of a single moment a universe blooms into existence as another path fades from view, Tom Riddle meets an aberration on the train to Hogwarts and the rest is in flux.

*** Thanks! I'm going to read October, since I saw many recommendations like this, but I never felt like reading. Thanks for the recommendations

*** I love October so much. What a wild ride!!! But possibly the best “Tom redeems himself” fic and how they portray blood supremacy.
