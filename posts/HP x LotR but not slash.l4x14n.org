Yo why tf is like every HPxLotR crossover slash? I mean it isn't like there are no women in Tolkien's works right? If anyone knows of a somewhat readable het fic with Harry as the main pairing I'd greatly appreciate it if you could link it.

No fem!Harry pls

P.S. I know of that one Eowyn story by the dude that also wrote shadow of angmar


** Nvm found a Harry/Tauriel one which was overlooked before due to me being an idiot and not realizing that LotR and Hobbit are two separate franchises on ffn (Go ao3 for simply categorizing them both as Tolkien's Works!)

Edit: Aaaaand it's shit

*** Tell me about it. I'm not even getting into nigh on every Harry Potter and Twilight crossover either as trust me, they tend to be slash

** The only good one I can see right now is "the shadow of angmar" but it has no pairing if that's what you're looking for.

*** Shadow of angmar is good enough to never ever need a pairing as far as I care. holy hell does it feel like tolkien's writing.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.
