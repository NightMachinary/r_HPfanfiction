I'm trying to find the story where Harry owns a casino and Ron racks up a lot of debt so Hermione goes to work for Harry to pay it off. there were others that work for him but that's as much as I can remember.

**** I tried to warn you lol. I'll give it to you so you don't have to join a secret society like I did to get it. It's been scrubbed clean from the rest of the internet. [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EaJZJ3XEhunXsm2ZnKaPTo9smGTtgx9z/view?usp=drivesdk]]

******** I thought I was getting the story you were looking for basically. When I had to join the Eunuch Archive to get it, I knew something was wrong. I went for it anyway though because I was already invested. Classic cost fallacy principle at work.

************ Yeah, but weird is better than copy cat fics. I was thinking of making a new email and seeing what would happen if I posted the fic on FF.net (with credit to the author). I bet I would be banned in 1 hr.
