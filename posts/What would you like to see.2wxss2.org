** I'd concentrate on what you'd like to write, rather than what people want to read. It's hard enough self-motivating when you're writing something you're actually interested in - I imagine the difficulty only goes up when it's something you're only lukewarm about.

That being said...

I'd like to see more fics about Hogwarts being a magical boarding school. That is, the ins and outs of everyday life with the Voldemort overarching conflict as a backdrop, not as a major set piece. Bonus points if Harry's romantic life gets tangled in amusing ways, and the fic is actually funny.

** Alchemy and the Philosopher's Stone. Safe and moral immortality as well as unlimited gold and it seems like no one gives a shit after the 1991 school year. Why wouldn't the entire plot revolve around this? Voldemort is supposed to be an amazing wizard, why doesn't he try to make his own?

Also, I'd love to see more about the Deathly Hallows and the Peverells. Are the Hallows really just extraordinary inventions or is the Tale partially true and they were actually created by Death himself? Or are they something else entirely? Does something amazing really happen when all three are united?

Basically, what I guess I'm trying to say is that I'd like to see authors use plot devices other than the horcruxes. The same old horcrux hunt gets old.

*** You should check out Aspirations by Megamatt09. It has a long arc with a vigilante just like you were talking about. Good fic overall: ambiguous morality, H/G ship that isn't so sugary sweet you want to puke, some good fights. The author can't spell to save his life though.

**** Personally, I find that the best stories are the ones that start out 5th year, touch on that year and move forward to 6th & 7th year while still keeping a nice flow going. To me, as a reader, it is important to have a continuous story that isn't feeling rushed or choppy. It is really cute to see the relationship progress and then to see the year they have with Harry, even though we know what is to come. That's just my two cents! :)

I was working on that idea and had something like this in the works

  Story Title: Divergence\\
  The divergence occurs when a seer had a vision of the future back before the Statute of Secrecy, instead of hiding the decide to overthrow the muggles and rule over them.

  Present time: England is ruled by twelve pure blood families who where part of council during the muggle/wizard war. Harry grew up believing he was a muggle, Living with the Dursleys in the lands Owned by the Weasleys (One of the Twelve families) until his fourteen birthday when Aurors come to his home to tell him he is the Ilegitme son of Lord James Potter and that he has fallen ill.

  Turns out that the marriage between muggleborns and purebloods is highly frowned upon, Tom Riddle and his Inquisition-esque group hunted Harry's mom and dad when they tried to elope and killed her and only spared's James life at the request of his Family. In exchange of that he had to marry Bellatrix Black to further both of their families ambitions of power. before this Lily had left baby harry in the care of her muggle sister. In the years between this and the present Dumbledore is kicked out of hogwarts for his radical ideas and Tom Riddle takes his place.

  When harry is called back to Potter's state he finds his father terminally ill; Acutally Bellatrix is slowly poisoning him and tells harry that if he doesn't want to end up like that he will become her puppet-heir. this because she can have babies so they pass Harry as James and Bellatrix Son.

  Bellatrix assigns Harry his personal Maid (Hermione) so she can prepare him for his fifth year to hogwarts,

  Hermione only chance to learn magic as a muggle born is to become a servant of a pureblood family, according to rules if she serves certain amount of time she would be gives an honorary halfblood status to her and all her descendants. also being the maid of a heir of a noble house allows her to attend to hogwarts classes with him.

  Hermione motivations are mostly to find a better life for her and her parents

  There is a small resistance of muggle/muggle borns/half bloods led by Albus who are trying to overthrow the class system and hide in a muggle city under fidelius charm

***** Damn i can give only one thumbs up.

Would definetly read 100 times over. I'm searching good quality fic of anti-tiranny!political!Harry . Expecially the ones where harry is fairly powerfull but the challenges he faces are ballanced with his power (he's not a peggy sue).

To give an example there's one where Regulus survives stealing the horcrux and he's a vigilante : Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina Regulus-Centric it's Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina

** A fic that does a good job of exploring Dumbledore in his younger days, particularly how he deals with the guilt of you know who's death (is it still a spoiler nearly eight years on?) and how he eventually beats Grindelwald. I don't think I've ever found one that's good.

** Personally, I'd love to see a good Harry Potter/Dead Like Me crossover. Maybe involving Fred becoming a reaper? His interactions with that cast of ridiculous characters would be amusing, and Fred getting over leaving his twin would be bittersweet. I'm not sure how you get Fred over to the US after death, though. That's probably why it hasn't, and will never, happen.

** I've thought of something else I wouldn't mind seeing in a story. In nearly every one I can remember where Harry or most any other character goes on a clothes shopping trip in the non-magical world, they go to Harrod's. I know it's a recognizable name, but I'd like to see a little variety in there.

** I enjoy harry/draco stories, you have to diverge from the timeline at some point for this to work and sometimes it's very AU. Other things I like but not necessarily all in the same story: - harry is more proactive in learning about magic and defense & just less reliant on Hermione. - harry is less trusting or has more scares from his abusive upbringing. Kids raised in abusive homes don't come out all trusting and well adjusted. - harry more interested in learning magic, he finds out magic is real & that's awesome why wouldn't he be more interested.

Harry with Luna and or Neville. I thought the books were going to go harry/Luna and I still enjoy this pairing, though Luna is hard to do right. I also like Neville to be more involved. Friend, member of the trio, lover?!? I dunno but Neville seems underused.
