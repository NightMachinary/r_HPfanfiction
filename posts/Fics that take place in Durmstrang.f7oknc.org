** Hmmm although it's not a total fit for your request I doubt you'll find one anywhere.

Here's: 'Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum' --> Harry goes to Durmstrang with Draco and is buddies with Viktor Krum. It works towarda a Harry/Fleur pairing and the teachers are bad ass. No sexy uniforms or underage drinking though.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

**** I didn't want this to come off as aggressive, but I didn't succeed, I guess. This is to people in general, not just you. Here are all the canon arguments that come to mind:

Have you read about Tonks? She's /awesome/ and definitely won't stand there and take it.

Ernie Macmillan turned the entire Hufflepuff house against Harry. One could argue he turned the entire school against him. (Basically, don't mess with a Hufflepuff.)

Cedric Diggory is no pushover. He is described more like a leader, in fact.

Pomona Sprout and many other Hufflepuffs fought in the Battle of Hogwarts.

Amelia Bones is said to have been a Hufflepuff. The head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. Not a position for someone who backs down in situations.
