** Leo Inter Serpentes by Aeternum A long series with fluffier take and a better behaved Draco, but enjoyable nonetheless. [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/53590]]

** Have you read the sacrifices arc, it is very long, spans all 7 years. It goes into the differences between pureblood society and the muggleborns. In some places too much in depth, but all the side plots are weaved together pretty well.

** You might enjoy linkao3(malfoy flavor by vorabiza). it's 6th year, and Harry is only in Slytherin rather than Gryffindor because he's pretending to be an entirely different person. There are circumstances that make this work. But, he did spend his first 5 years in Gryffindor, so it might not be quite what you were thinking of.

  Harry's ready to banish the Golden Boy image and take charge of his life. Unfortunately for him, or fortunately, there are surprises in store for him.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/9065263][Written on the Heart]] has a slytherin Harry after an 8th year re-sorting. It was really good but the resorting didn't make much sense.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1875756][Tempus]] also has a slytherin Harry and a really unique and interesting time travel plot. I really recommend it. linkao3(1875756; 9065263)

  Harry doesn't mind that so many Slytherins from his year have returned to finish their NEWTs, really he doesn't. It's just -- do they have to be so friendly? He's not prejudiced, really he's not. It's just -- they've got to be up to something, right? Unnerved by the attention he's attracting from everyone -- the Slytherins are the least of it, to be fair -- and struggling with a raft of changes to Hogwarts itself, Harry wishes he could be happy that one constant remains: Draco Malfoy really fucking hates him.When he's hit by an illegal love-spell though, Harry finds he has more to worry about than whether or not Blaise Zabini actually wants to be his friend. For if everyone affected has been blessed -- or cursed, by the look on Malfoy's face -- with a magical tattoo revealing the name of their soulmate, what does it mean that Harry's skin remains completely bare?

  Did you ever wonder where the Hogwarts disappearing corridors go--or when? When Harry Potter finds himself at Hogwarts in 1927 he never expected that the first person he would run into would be... Draco Malfoy?? 85,000 words. Written for the "hp_cliche" challenge in 2006, run by ReganV. Beta-read by Miraba. Harry is magically transported back to Hogwarts in 1926, and until they find a way to return him to 1997, he is enrolled as a student. The very first student he meets is a blond Slytherin named Draco Malfoy. A time without Voldemort gives Harry the chance to learn things about magic and himself, but that era is not without certain evils. Mixes mystery, romance, action/adventure, and first-time smut. Nominated for a Multi-faceted Award. Additional warnings: Corporal punishment, teacher/student, consensual BDSM as well as dubious consent, torture, alcohol consumption.
