It was set during the summer at the Dursley's house. Draco comes to the house asking for help and gives Harry a baby saying that he will explain everything later. Basically it ends up being his daughter that he saved from a death eater attack. Draco, his daughter, and his mother move into Harry's bedroom at the dursleys. Petunia knows and helps a little bit. I don't remember much else. This was a awesome fan fic, long and well written, but I can't remember who wrote it or it's name. If you know which it is or even think you know let me know the title and I'll see if I can find it. Thank you in advanced!

***** So I just finished homework and went to read the fanfic, but the sites not loading, I'm assuming (and praying) that it's just down for maintenance. Is it down for you as well?

****** It is down for me. I have seen the site go down temporarily before and hopefully it will come back again. It was up yesterday when I linked the fic. I did find the fic over at Skyehawke and you can read it there if you don't want to wait for The Hex Files to come back.
