In the original series, magical theory is approached in a very haphazard way. Its like JK Rowling didn't originally know what the 'total' set of spells existing in her universe, and so just made them up as she went along. For instance, the shield charm is only introduced in the 4th book (and no defensive spells exist beyond that), there are only single (highly illegal) spells to torture/kill someone, and whole aspects of wizardry like inventing spells or potions are never at all explored.

I read HPMOR, and although it mixed technology and magic a little more than it needed to, it still had a lot of interesting stuff like setting up personal wards to protect yourself and innovative uses of the environment to attack people.

Sorry for the crappy explanations, but are there any fics that explores magic in a well developed, theoretical, systematic way like I tried to describe?


** Try fics by [[/u/Taure]]. His current story is linkffn(Victoria Potter by Taure).

Taure tends to dive deeply into magic, while still preserving the original feel of the world.

*** Another good fic for this is linkffn(The One He Feared). It's short and incomplete, but it features many types of magic. As usual, the writing is amazing.

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances.

** The Akren School Of Magic series by Miranda Flairgold is exactly what you're looking for:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/100447/Miranda-Flairgold]]

The third book is abandoned, but the first two are right in your wheelhouse.
