*** I didn't see anyone being downvoted for rec'ing that Lucius/Hermione rapey story a while back... Can't recall what it was called, but I think Lucius 'saved' her from Dolohov or something.

But this is not the first time that someone has complained about this story (I could swear that it was on FFNet before?). Funny how double standards work, isn't it?

**** And that's were all the abusive Ron stories come from. Now, don't get me wrong, I like Weasley bashing but the whole "Maybe I can make him a better person" thing while he is abusing said female (be it Hermione, Luna or whoever else) is simply ridiculous. There are far better ways to bash Ron without going that far from canon.

***** I'm really not sure how I should react to this comment. Bashing is awful writing. Full Stop. There is no good way of bashing. Bashfics are the sewage of writing and it baffles me time and time again that people would like them.

What I meant with "rough diamond" is that Ron is about as socially refined as your stereotypical country kid, but he's generally a good guy and in any good fic that may define his charm.

****** It really depends on the execution (no pun intended). If I depict the flaws of a character with a critical eye many people call that bashing.

For example, like I said, I don't like the Weasleys. The only one I like is Charly. Percy is somewhat alright. He went against his family and Dumbledore but by doing so he sided with the ministry, which is not better. But I can really relate to his need of getting away from Dumbledore because Dumbledore is at least guilty of endangerment in several hundred cases as well as accessory of child abuse and torture (sending Harry to the Dursleys). You really should not blindly follow that guy.

Now, if I were to ever publish a story they would not be depicted kindly but I wouldn't make stuff up either. Molly is admitting to and joking about using rape drugs. Arthur is completely incompetent in his profession. Ron ditched Harry more than once. The twins tested their products on kids. While harmless to themselves they did not take into account that the kids could have anything from an allergy to taking medicine which could lead to strange and lethal results.

No adult Weasley reported the abuse Harry went through. They kept sending him food and broke him out from behind barred windows. They saw the rags. They knew.

And if Molly is ok with using rape drugs on Arthur and is joking about that to her children who is to say that she did not dose Harry? The monster in the chest sounds awfully like the effects of a love and/or jealousy potion. All Harry needs in a nudge in the right direction (sounds familiar?) That can be part of the story without turning her into "evil potion queen Molly" who doses everyone with everything under the sun.

Tl;dr: You can write good Weasley Bashing while still having them be their canon selves.

******* How about how Harry is so emotionally volatile that he shoves everyone away? Or how his shortsighted thinking gets people hurt or, in some cases, killed? How about his naivety? His lack of skill and know how? His self-righteous Messiah complex? His insensitivity to those who don't pander to him? Why don't you see these traits in fanfiction?

Joke. I doubt she's been slipping Arthur a love potion every day for the past twenty-some years. Arthur is very skilled at his job but as Percy says, he has no ambition. Ron didn't ditch Harry. Harry told him to go both times. He told Ron to leave during the horcrux hunt, and he pushed Ron away during fourth year. It wasn't Ron's responsibility to apologize, yet he did anyway. Wizards don't take medicine and Fred and George aren't incompetent enough to use something deadly on people. They try their own things out on themselves and reimburse those they have test their products.

******* sigh... You know, I had a 10 paragraph argument typed out, but I'll just not gonna bother. Its just not a good argument to use real life standards on a universe with its own standards, including that the universe is specifically designed to tell a story. If everybody in HP would have reacted like responsible humans, guess what? There would be no Harry Potter. The story would have never been printed.

******* I agree with most of what you said about the Weasley's, and there's definitely a lot of truth there (can't speak on the issue of Molly and love potions, it's been too long since I read the books) but I disagree on what you said about Ron. The only times he ever ditched Harry in times of need where during the triwizard cup, which was admittedly a dick move, and during the horcrux hunt, while he was being influenced by an evil artifact that had been consistently shown to bring out the worst in people, and as soon as he was out of its influence he tried to get back but couldn't because of various events.

I still think they're important things to remember about a family that's usually either vilified or put on a pedastal (can you name any other characters that the fandom does that to?), even though they have flaws and strengths just as everyone else.
