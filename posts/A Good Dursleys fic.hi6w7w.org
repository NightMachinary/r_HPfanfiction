:END:
P.s. this is all the pre-Hogwarts arc of the story. So what I remember is that Petunia lost Dudley in childbirth which had a chain effect on how they acted. Vernon lost a lot of weight due to depression and Petunia was constantly (?) crying a lot. They agreed to take Harry in if the magicals restored Petunia's fertility. They treated Harry like a son and had another son who I think was named Jason(?). Anyways Vernon's job made him travel a lot overseas so they moved at least twice ending up in China where Harry and Jason joined a Shaolin Temple. At one point before Harry was being chased by some Chinese gangsters for being white and he used accidental magic to make himself look Chinese. The last thing I remember was at the graduation tournament he fought a Chinese looking kid with platinum blonde hair who turned out to be Malfoy who beat Harry using a pair of magical gauntlets.
