** One of my many projects in the initial stages is one that fits this:

Working Title: Self Insert.

After rinsing my dishes, I store them in the dishwasher until there are enough dishes in it to make running the beast worthwhile.

My 'have to's' of the day are done. I finished the hotfix for the transaction code mistranslation issue, and deployed it to the affected servers, so as far as work is concerned, life is good. I dropped my wife off at the airport this morning at 6 am for a three-week vacation in Scotland with her best friend, visiting family and taking care of a few issues left over from her Uncle's death two years before. I wished I could have gone along as it's been 30 years since I've been to Dunoon, but too many major projects are deploying over the next two months, so, I can't.

Next time, I promised. Just like I had the last 5 times.

Anyway, the lawn is mowed and the flowerbeds watered. Someday I'm going to pave the entire thing so I don't have to mow it anymore. I went over my mental checklist one last time. Everything I had to do, is done. Time for what I want to do.

I write fan fiction, most of it bad, but I've got a following. Little I do is in any way original, rather it draws on fifty-plus years of reading, watching television and movies, and enthusiastically stealing ideas from other writers, but it seems to please some people. I enter my office with a glass of diet Pepsi, sit down at my desk, and turn on my computer. With the SSD I installed about a year ago, my desktop boots in 12 seconds. Logging in takes longer, but not much. I start my word processor and purposefully don't start any of the other programs the machine holds. I've learned the hard way that I am far too susceptible to falling into the time pit that is Youtube, email, or the worst of the worst of time eaters, Kerbal Space Program.

Harry Stark needs me. A new friend just died and while he doesn't know it, his lawyers in the UK have been heading off the Ministry's efforts to slime his reputation. He's going to have his hands full for his 5th year, and that's even before he has to deal with the changes in his romantic relationships. Chapter 26 is nearly outlined, pushing through to the Christmas holidays. I still haven't decided just how Harry is going to deal with Umbridge, though I'm leaning toward his just ignoring her... Maybe doing a bit of Calculus during her class, that should do it.

I turn on the television and thumb 762 on the remote so that Cartoon Network comes on. They're running a One Punch Man marathon, that will give me an entertaining background to work with.

*---=== SI ===---*

I'm suddenly somewhere else, submerged in a scalding liquid inhaling whatever it is. I rise from the liquid, finding myself standing waist-deep in a scalding, yet somehow tolerable milky fluid. I blinked my eyes, trying to clear them of the acidic fluid and struggling to clear my airway.

What the fuck is going on? I hear a sobbing noise behind me, and turn to face the source. A balding man, on his knees holding the stump of his right forearm. Blood still pumped from the stump despite the pressure the stranger was putting on his wound. Beyond the maimed man was a young boy, maybe 12 or so, tied to a tombstone... A tombstone? I looked around in surprise, yes, I was in a cemetery, and the boy was the very image of what I had imagined Harry Potter to look like. Not Radcliffe's athletic (if short), well-fed, 16-year-old frame from the Goblet of Fire, but a small child who looked younger than his age, hinting at a life of something less than optimal care.

Harry Potter? I blinked before returning my attention to the kneeling man. The kneeling man with rat-like features... Pettigrew? I looked down and saw that I was standing waist-deep in a round metal... cauldron. My exposed flesh was almost alabaster white, my fingers elongated, much longer than those on my own normal hands. I raised my hands to grasp my face and then ran them over my bald skull.

Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Am I Lord Voldemort?

*---=== SI ===---*

The only possible explanation is that I'm in a Self-Insert. How am I in a Self-Insert? I hate Self-Inserts. There are rare exceptions in that genre that turn out to be quite entertaining, Like Zoat's 'With This Ring', but by and large, they are nothing more than pointless wankery based on wish fulfillment. But if this is a Self-Insert, I would be writing it. How could I be writing it? How...

I've had a stroke. That's the only thing that makes sense. I've stroked out in front of my computer and I'm imagining all this. Damn. No one is home, my wife is gone for three weeks, my daughter, typically won't stop by to check on me, under the pretense of taking me out to dinner until the end of the week. I'm going to die sitting in front of my computer. I'm never going to finish Technomage or Distaff side. Damn it.

Lacking any real options, I decided that I might as well play out my last story as best I can. Why would I make myself the villain? Questions for later.

I concentrate and my mind is flooded with knowledge of magic and how to use it. With a thought, I rise from the cauldron and settle on a bare patch of ground.

“Robe me,” I say in a disturbingly high pitched voice, and Pettigrew rose from his knees, still sobbing and moaning and cradling his mutilated arm. He scrambled to pick up the black robes from the ground, reached up, and pulled the garment onehanded over my head. All the while I was wondering just how far I was going to take this. "Your arm," I said as imperiously as I could manage considering what I sounded like. "And my wand."

Despite never having held an actual wand, it was as if my new body knew how to use it. I knew that I needed to fix Pettigrew's arm before he bled out. Lacking any other ideas, I found how to make his silver arm from Goblet of Fire, and created the appendage, which was disturbingly like the T-1000's arm from Terminator 2. Pettigrew was so enamored by his new arm, he never noticed when the stunning spell hit him.

Leaving the sycophant where he lay, I made my way to the boy still bound to the tombstone. The terror in his eyes clear even from a distance, I gestured and the ropes fall away, releasing Harry. Despite his fear, the boy stood massaging his wrists staring at me. I summoned his wand and placed it in his hand. "Take your friend's body and use the cup. It will take you back to Hogwarts."

"What?" he asked. This was not what he had expected to hear when he witnessed the rebirth of his greatest enemy.

"Go home," I instructed him. "Go back to the school, and don't trust Moody. He's one of my followers using Polyjuice. Go to Dumbledore and tell him. Stay close to the old man and you'll be all right."

Harry nodded, clearly not trusting me not to hex him in the back. The boy backed away from me and made his way to the fallen Cedric Diggory, and then summoned the cup and vanished.

I nodded to myself after the boy disappeared and returned to Pettigrew. I hit him with a rennervate and kicked him a couple of times for good measure. "Wake up, Peter," I said, "we have plans to make."

** I believe the fic you are looking is called "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19275442][A reluctant rebirth]]" by Slytherinlife on ao3.

When someone dies, they lose their memory and are reborn as someone else. That's how it should be.

"Should" is the key word.

No one wants to be reborn as Harry Potter. No one wants to keep their memories while being reborn as Harry Potter. I repeat: NO ONE WANTS TO BE HARRY- Oh forget it, I'm going into Slytherin.

** Eh, doesn't really make sense.

Sure, the first thought is "Oh Shit, I'm Dead", but the second one is "Oh Sweet, Death isn't the end" followed by "Even Sweeter, i'm a wizard now!".

Even if you're Harry and everyone wants to kill you it wouldn't be that jarring since, y'know, been there, done that.

  "Fix it" said the Fates. "Fix what? With what tools and skills?" I asked. Being dead was only the first of the obstacles. And then I found myself in an understairs cupboard listening to a little boy quietly sobbing. Oh. Fix THAT. In which a sarcastic old git is dropped into the awful childhood of Harry Potter. SI, no ships. Rated M for foul language and canon-level abuse.
