Surely there are a lot of Fics that have Harry being popular and Famous, because of his title and the Females are eager to date or have fun with him.

​

But i got curious now, if there are basically the same Fics but with Ron. Lets say, he got in a way famous after Hogwarts, when he took a good career in Quidditch (maybe he has fun with his teammates) or some over Profession, that might have use in his tactical thinking. He wont need to look for Women, they are finding him and want some fun with him. He wouldnt refuse, because now he gets the positive attention, that Harry always had and he isn in a relationship currently...and maybe other possible Reasons.

I dont Mind if one if his Dates would be Hermione, but she would know, that he has a rather active Sex life and changing partners.

I can imagine it would result in a kind of OoC Ron, but i would accept it, as long as he would still be close to his Canon self.

The Story can end with Ron in a Solid Relationship, but i would like if that happens rather late.


** linkao3(Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis by Starfox5)

Harry, Ron, and Hermione are all tomb raiders, Harry and Hermione are an established couple, Ron is kind of a Captain Kirk character banging exotic women wherever they go, although they've brought one with them and Ron seems to be mostly monogamous at the time of the story. I haven't read it for a long time so I could be misremembering/ quite a bit has been written since I left off so conditions may have changed towards the end.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to “Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider”.
