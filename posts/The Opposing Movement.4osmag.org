Hello! I would like to promote my fanfic here. I promoted the first chapter here a while back, but there were too many errors (both grammatical and plot-wise) at the time, so I took it down, took on a beta, reread and revised it, and now it's back!

The premise is that Harry and Ginny were seen in the company of Sirius Black, and have to flee Hogwarts. The Ministry for Magic is always on their heels, Voldemort is looming in the shadows and there are many other factions intent on capturing the three.

I have written 63.000 words, divided into 11 chapters already, and these will be published regularly in the coming weeks. The remainder of the story is sketched out and ready to be written.

Thank you in advance for reading it! Feedback, however critical you like, is always welcome!

Thanks to Ham for beta'ing!

** My only advice would be: Minor characters matter.

Take Fudge for instance, the man's a bit bumbling, and not afraid to do bad for his political career, but you've got him written as the stereotypical "Must hold power even if I have to kill babies" minister at the moment. Some of the word choices have him portrayed as a fan on stereotype. Calling Harry a "brat" when I assume he's both never met him and in the books is portrayed as only getting nasty once Harry has actively opposed him. "precious reign" is another bit which portrays him as extremely power hungry.

I suppose my point is that writing these characters as irrational stereotypes can put people off. When a character makes decisions and has traits or lines of thought which are utterly absurd and irrational on any level it's just poor writing choices. So make sure if you are going to have an evil is Fudge, let him have reasons and reservations that normal humans would still have. For instance is it rational for any normal human being to want to send a thirteen year old to prison? House arrest maybe, but Azkaban?

*** Thank you for the critique, and that's a very good point you make.

As a counter-argument, I would say that it becomes clear from all the news articles that Harry isn't loved in this story, and he's a handful for the Ministry. He's being portrayed as a dangerous child, even a murderer, who constantly gets away with it, despite protests. That explains Fudge's attitude towards Harry.

But you do make a good point that he's being mindlessly evil, at least partly. Luckily, he won't be prominent in this story, and there are more villains to come who have more backstory and motivation.

But I'll keep this in mind for future writing. Thank you for pointing it out to me!

**** So, I read your story. I like it. There were a few phrases here and there where your tenses were a bit odd, but nothing major that bothered me. The opening character- the one reading the newspapers- he was kinda necessary for explaining Slytherin Harry, but with only 5k words, having a complete unknown that does nothing but info-dump on us is a bit of a turn-off. I get the impression that he will be a significant, if not main character, so it's not so bad, but without any more words to read, it lowers the overall feel/score by half a point or so.

***** Yes, Melchior will be an important character in the story. But you're right that it's a bit off-putting to throw an OC at the reader, especially in fanfiction. Some like it, some don't. A lot of people don't want OCs in fanfiction at all, and I understand that.

About the info-dump: when I started writing this, I wanted to write about Harry's time at Hogwarts as well. But I got stuck there and I felt like I was just writing the millionth Hogwarts story. So I decided to skip forward a lot, but in doing so, you miss a lot of backstory. I used an info-dump to paint an image of what we missed, but the downside of that is indeed that it could be off-putting.

Thank you very much for the critique!
