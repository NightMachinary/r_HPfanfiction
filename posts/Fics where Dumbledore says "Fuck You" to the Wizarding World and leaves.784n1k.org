Just saw one of those umpteenth Dumbledore bashing posts. I'd like to read a fic which starts off like your typical bashing fic, Dumbledore's intentions are questioned every single time, every bad thing that happened is obviously his fault, everyone blames him for being manipulative etc.

But then Dumbledore decides he's had enough, that he has nothing to gain helming the war for a bunch of assholes and basically says "Fuck it. I got rid of one Dark Lord for you. You take care of this one.", and just leaves to chill with Fawkes, maybe with a follow-up on how the war is going without him. Is there a fic like this? Obviously nothing that takes itself too seriously.


** Lol, perfect set up is during his peace out moment in the office. "Well it's just that you seem to be labouring under the delusion that I am going to -- come quietly. I am afraid I am not going to come quietly at all, Cornelius. I have absolutely no intention of being sent to Azkaban. I could break out, of course -- but what a waste of time, and frankly, I can think of a whole host of things I would rather be doing." And then Dumbledore takes Fawkes away to Disney world.

I prefer to believe this is exactly what he did in canon.

** Oh yes! Bonus points if Dark Independent Badass Harry who's been ranting about Dumbledore manipulating and controlling his life, suddenly discovers that he doesn't last five minutes without him! :)

** Turns out Dumbledore was God-emperor of man-kind in secret. Of course, this was before the time where he opened up to the public. So, he had to be seen as a powerful but mortal man in the end. Harry was his first attempt at Astartes...
