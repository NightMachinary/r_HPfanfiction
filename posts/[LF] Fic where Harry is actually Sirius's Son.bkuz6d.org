By son I mean like biological son

I'd read something similar in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4947538/chapters/11357134][The Best Mistake]] recently and I wanted to see if there was anything similar to it out there


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10727911/1][Black Sky]]

has this as an excuse to have the Blacks take female!Harry in...

I love the fic, but feel like the explanation (given in first chapter or so) is a bit meh. James Sterile due to prank, Sirius asked to help, kid then Blood-adopted into Potter line but it ain't really discussed after that chapter.
