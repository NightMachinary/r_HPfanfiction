I imagined a fic that contained Harry and Draco in some sort of "physical" relationship. Draco is attracted to harry and possibly has even feelings for him. But Harry doesnt feel the same. He enjoys the pleasures that Draco gives him, but he isnt "that" fixated for the other Gender.

I thought that Harry would allow draco to give him a blowjob and maybe penetrate his ass, but he wouldnt suck Dracos cock.....atleast not, if he is not homo- or bisexual.

â€‹

I thought about a scenario that might have Draco and Harry sitting on a Sofa with Harry reading something and Draco asks "Harry, may i suck your cock?" and Harrys response being positive.

Harry, though, is in their "Relationship" the rather dominant type, but i would appreciate no dirty talk.
