I've seen a grand total of one fic in which this is the case, and want to see more. Any recommendations?

Preferably complete and with no slash, but I'll settle for incomplete

*** I'm looking for specifically Snape dying via Remus/James not saving him in time, and the rest of the fic focusing on the ramifications of this. And no, I wasn't referring to that, I found a fic in which this happened, and then Snape became a ghost amd Evil!DumbledoreTM trapped him in the Shack so he couldn't tell anyone how he died...It wasn't particularly good, and had slash, but was thankfully short and fairly unique. I can't remember the title right now, but if you want me to I could probably find it.

Thanks for the recommendation, I'll definitely be checking this out!

** That's a pretty specific request. Mind sharing the one that you've already read?

*** Sure, I'll find the link, and to elaborate on my response to samsungfutanari69 (What a username) I'm not looking for one where SPECIFICALLY Snape comes back as a ghost, although it could involve that, just one where James doesn't successfully save him and he dies. The first chapter of the story samsungfutanari69 linked does this (though after reading chapter 1 of that story, it doesn't seem particularly good :/)

Anyway, here's the link: linkffn(1691900)

Keep in mind what I said about the story in my response to samsungfutanari69 (repeatedly typing that is starting to get annoying).

  COMPLETE The Shrieking Shack was rumoured to be haunted. Then, after a prank went awry, that was no longer a rumour. HPSS Slash

73 Aberdeen is slash (SB/RL) but it fits your other requirements so thought I'd recommend it anyway.

  There are some things ungoverned by fate. If Sirius Black had gone the path of every Black before him, if he had been in Slytherin, he would have been a very different boy. It would have been a very different war.
