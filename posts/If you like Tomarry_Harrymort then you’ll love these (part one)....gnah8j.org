1) “Surrender” by Piampont

“Harry writes a letter of surrender to Voldemort. The dark lord is intrigued.”

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7241394/1/Surrender]]

2) “Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux” by Imaginizer

“In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest of places... even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds comfort and solace in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord.”

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11762850/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Accidental-Horcrux]]

3) “The Rise of a Dark Lord” by Little.Miss.Xanda

“Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later, Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that, he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.”

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/517540]]

4) “Necromancer's Anonymous” by The Iza

“Harry Potter was a normal child, aside from the whole raising the undead thing, but what are you gonna do?”

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3899261/1/Necromancers-Anonymous]]

5) “50 Heartbeats Away From Romance” by RenderedReversed

“Harry finds an oddly cuddly pet in the Dark Lord, and Voldemort finds a sanctuary for his heart in his old nemesis. Fate had never been so strange.”

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1591592/chapters/3383591]]

6) “Fate's Favourite” by The Fictionist

“You always get stories where Harry goes back into Tom Riddle's time, then either stays or gets sent back. End of, unless he tries to make Voldemort good. But what if things went differently? What if, just once, someone followed the time-traveller back?”

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5725656/1/Fate-s-Favourite]]

7) “Seventeen Years” by RenderedReversed

“Voldemort is a day old when he realizes those blasted muggles named him ‘Tom'. And he's a day old when it fully sinks in that being reborn, legitimately, instead of from an experimental ritual sucked. Because he has no idea where he is, what time he's in, who these people are... and he can't control who he's born with. Namely, some other brat who would take the title of his twin... his brother.

He is a year old when it sinks in who his twin could possibly be.

Because his twin might possibly, probably, be Harry Potter.”

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1810903]]

8) “Full Circle” by Tetsurashian

“(aka. ‘how to survive endless rebirth with your so-called soulmate')

Harry and Tom's souls are tied together, which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth.

At some point they just stopped caring and started fking with people.”

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6614155]]

9) “Young Princes” by Little.Miss.Xanda

“Harry had no idea how it was even possible, however it didn't really matter. What matters is that they were there and he would do anything to protect them. Even if that meant siding with Voldemort. Even so, he was sure he had been suffering with temporary insanity, how else could he explain how they came to be? Yes, temporary insanity was the only explanation.”

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1852684]]

10) “In Somno Veritas” by Ansketil and Lilacs

“‘Are you often in my dreams, Harry? I have not touched your mind since our little encounter at the Department of Mysteries... and yet here you are... saving me in my nightmares.'”
