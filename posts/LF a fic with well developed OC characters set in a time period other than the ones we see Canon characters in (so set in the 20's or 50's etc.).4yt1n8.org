I've been looking for OC centric stories set in the HP universe that have little or no Canon character involvement. The few ffs that I've found centered on an OC usually involve them being added to the trio or dating Draco or yadda yadda. It's to the point where I'm getting ready to just write my own.

I suppose some Canon is ok, such as a character attending school in '45 as Dumbledore would be the Transfiguration professor (I think that's about right, I didn't look it up sooo). Additionally, it doesn't have to be set at Hogwarts or be about English wizards.

Anything related to this or places I might be able to find it myself would be awesome. Thanks!

  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.

***** It isn't the main point of the fic, but Artemsia is becoming an auror very soon. So, yes, there's quite a bit of magic in the coming chapters.
