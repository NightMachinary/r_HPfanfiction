Hi, i just finished 105 chapters of HP and the prince of slytherin by the sinsiter man. I found it very entertaining. The AU is very immersive. But i cannot wait 2 months for a chapter update. I need to feed my addiction.

So if you know Similar HP Fanfic, with really good story & writing (AU - read too many cannon type stories) please could you suggest them to me.

  Power is a fickle mistress. You court her for centuries, nourish her, shelter her from those who are unworthy, and everything is as it should be. But then, she laughs, stabbing you in the back with cold daggers of reckoning. Still, the Blacks aren't overly discouraged. They've been at this dance longer than anyone else, they know one thing for certain: an old flame never dies. AU

**** Nope. There's some weird overtones happening between Harry and Voldie, but it's not really sexual.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

*** Was going to mention this one. It's basically a straight up copy of Prince of Slytherin, especially in year one. However, instead of trying to subvert, improve, and justify the tropes like Prince does, it just has all the tropes as is, in all their horrible glory. It's still a decent read despite this, and it's better written than most fics with those tropes, but a lot of characters are basically one dimensional caricatures. And the Slytherin wanking is unreal. I've only read the first three books, but I would be surprised if these things changed.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
