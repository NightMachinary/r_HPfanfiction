Hi, I was wondering if there are any fanfics where Harry has a real service dog (meaning I really don't want to read one where Sirius becomes his SD). It could be for anything really, blindness, PTSD, etc. It can be the main point of the fanfic or it could just be apart of it, either is fine. Thank you!

Again, please no Sirius being his service dog.


** I don't know about SD, but in Basilisk Eyes, Harry is blind.

  As Harry Potter slays the Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets, blood and venom get in his eyes, mostly blinding him. While Harry learns to adapt, he makes some new friends. But this is more than a story of adaptation and friendship as there are threats... and Harry isn't the only one with a past that haunts him.
