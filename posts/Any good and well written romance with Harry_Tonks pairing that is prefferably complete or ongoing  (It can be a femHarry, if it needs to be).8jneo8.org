**** Basically, imagine if after the dementor's attack in book 5, Harry instead of waiting like a good boy, and the ministry sent 2 hit-wizards to arrest him, made him flee on his broom, causing a massive chase that ended up changing the future. Tonks is going to be his "sidekick/lover/sisterInArms" all in one, and Sirius, James and Lily have a darker past than canon, with a more proactive role in the war, following a impressive dude that doesn't bow to Dumbledore and is as scary as Voldemort to his enemies.

Not to mention a time-dilatation over Hogwarts that is making everything so bloody confusing.

that's Pretty much it without giving too many spoilers, and by that, i mean that the twists in this story are worth not reading any spoilers. At least IMO.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

***** I generally don't like fem!Harry, but this one I thought was good. That may have been because I understood a lot of the references about Myskatonic University, and things like the vorpal bunny (still makes me laugh!). Others may not have understood and didn't want to Google while reading, the Umbridge family being an offshoot of the whatever's for instance.

For me, my biggest problem was Harry calmly accepting his change in gender. For most people their sexuality plays a large part of their self identification. Even complete social outcasts have some sexual self-identity. I would have been much happier with a transparent & plot convenient line about how dimension hopping into Jamie magically altered Harry somehow, over the reason we did get, "I didn't have time to make social connections so I don't care."

Otherwise this is among my favorite stories.
