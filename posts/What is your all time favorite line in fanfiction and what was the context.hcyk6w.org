  Ron followed his gaze to land on their sleeping friend. "You ever find it amusing that everyone's convinced Hermione's just a nice, polite, girl we drag along on our crazy adventures while she tries to restrain us?"

  Harry raised an eyebrow. "As opposed to an enthusiastic enabler always willing to help us in our search, and who set fire to a professor in her first year here? And started a brawl with another girl in her second, just to create an opportunity to snatch a hair from her for illegal polyjuice use?"

*** Another good passage from that story, not quite a quote, but fuck it, have some Dumbledore.

#+begin_quote
  From beyond his bent head, he listened as Dumbledore spoke, "A grave story, Harry, and a tragic one, though through no fault of your own." Harry winced. "What I can't help but wonder, however, is how Miss Weasley acquired the diary in the first place. When we consider whose diary it was, I fear the answer may be of grave importance. I know you are grieving, Molly, Arthur, but I have to ask if you have any ideas."

  The conversation continued haltingly and broken, as Mrs. Weasley tried to muffle tears at the thought that their laxed vigilance might have allowed harm to come to their daughter. Sensing the attention had shifted away from him, Harry raised his head slightly to observe the room.

  He, too, wished to know how Ginny had gotten the diary.

  Watching the others as the discussion continued, Dobby's strange behavior caught his eye. The house elf deliberately locked gazes with him, then slid his eyes to his master, then followed this by hitting himself hard on the head. Then kept repeating the entire cycle. Granted, Dobby had always been weird, but this was a further step into the bizarre. /What on Earth is he-?/

  His eyes widened, remembering a seemingly harmless past action which suddenly acquired horrifying significance. He looked at Mr. Malfoy, then looked back at Dobby. The elf nodded vigorously, then hit himself again.

  Anger curled through him, and in some ways it was a welcome relief. He stood abruptly, interrupting the discussion and Mr. Weasley's grief filled reply. "Mr. Malfoy knows where she got it, doesn't he?" He stared at the man. The grey eyes flickered briefly, and Harry knew he was right. Rage ticked higher in his blood. "You put the diary in Ginny's textbooks while we were buying school supplies at the beginning of the year." And then, softly, certainly, accusation as heavy as the weight of Hogwarts itself: "You killed her."

  He was furious. The kind of fury he might have felt toward Riddle, if fear and horror and the need to /act/ had not crushed all beneath it. The kind of fury he would have felt afterwards, if grief had left space for any other emotion. But now, now there was no one left to attack him, for they were dead. And there was no one left to save, for she was dead too. He'd slayed the Basilisk, who'd only been following a parselmouth's orders. He'd stabbed Riddle, and felt nothing but satisfaction for his death. But Mr. Malfoy had started this, was responsible for this, and right now he wanted nothing more than to see Malfoy /bleed/.

  Papers began to shuffle slightly, as if an unseen hand passed over them. The faint flicker of light only distantly registered. When Dumbledore's ceramic candy dish cracked clean through, he didn't even twitch. And the gasps as, behind him, the sword he'd killed the Basilisk with rose slowly off the desk and turned to point towards Malfoy, were distant, important, mere sound without significance.

  "/You/," he repeated, "killed Ginny."

  And the sword shot towards Malfoy as though banished at him.

  His lunge to the side came in time to save his skin, but not his cloak.

  The man kept his balance, though, and had managed to both unfasten his cloak's throat clasp and draw his wand, so that when he whirled to face Harry it was pointed at him. "No one tries to kill me, Potter."

  Mr. and Mrs. Weasley both had their wands out, and so did Professor McGonagall, though she appeared to be trying her best to restrain them. Harry was going for his own wand when Dumbledore thundered, "/Enough!/" and a shimmering white curtain appeared between Malfoy, and the rest of the room.

  Broken from his single-minded fury, Harry blinked, then shifted his gaze to see the sword still pinning Malfoy's cloak, embedded halfway into the solid stone wall where Malfoy had been standing.

  That /had/ to have been him.

  But how?

  Somehow, shrinking a sweater or turning his teacher's hair blue just didn't seem to be on this magnitude. Although vanishing the glass at the zoo just might have been something close.

  /Too bad it doesn't seem to work on living things./

  Then he thought about the likelihood that he would have vanished Dudley by now, and was forced to -- reluctantly -- revise.

  "Dumbledore." Malfoy looked somewhat ruffled, but he retained the entitled arrogance that made Harry's hands curl into fists. "That boy attacked a governor of Hogwarts. I /demand/ he be expelled at once."

  The bottom of his stomach dropped out. /No,/ he thought, /he can't do that./ But the curling uncertainty fluttering through him belied that thought. /Can he?/ Panicked, he looked at Dumbledore.

  But Dumbledore seemed utterly unconcerned.

  "Come now, Lucius," the Headmaster began, speaking lightly, cajolingly. "I understand you are upset. But as a school governor, you know we've never held the mishaps of accidental magic against the children who perform them." His easy, nonchalant tone turned Harry's actions into a minor bit of accidental mischief, and reframed Malfoy's demand for expulsion into a hysterical overreaction. "It's not fair to punish a young witch or wizard for something they have no control over."

  "A /mishap/?" Malfoy almost choked, voice rising in furious indignation. "Harry Potter tried to kill me!"

  "Indeed." Despite everything, Harry almost laughed at that serene acknowledgment. Malfoy's haughty, indifferent mask was well and truly shattered. The man seemed squarely caught between impotent rage and utter disbelief. "But he used no wand, as we can attest. And I'm sure Harry didn't banish the sword on purpose, did you my boy?"

  He glared at Malfoy, "Not /knowingly/..."

  Ignoring the dark menace in his student's tone, Dumbledore smiled. "Very good." He clapped his hands together. "In that case, I'm afraid it must be ruled accidental magic. As an esteemed governor of our fine institution, you know all about the unavoidable difficulties young witches and wizards encounter while struggling to train their magic." Dumbledore peered at the man from over his half-moon glasses. "Though you may wish to avoid Harry in the future." It was said offhandedly, almost an afterthought. "His powers do seem somewhat volatile around you."

  Harry had never before realized that the headmaster's slightly absent-minded, grandfatherly calmness could be used as a weapon. It was... unexpectedly awesome.

  But Malfoy recouped his poise quickly. "Headmaster, if you'll not expel him for attempted murder, I'm afraid I'm forced to take this to the Ministry. He is clearly a danger to others." The man didn't even bother with faking a tone of civic concern. "We'll hear what they have to say about the matter."

  Dumbledore's face remained calm. "That's a serious accusation, Lucius. One I don't believe you wish to pursue. Undoubtedly, a major inquisition would ask /why/ Mr. Potter was so upset that he hurled a sword at you with accidental magic. And his story would have interesting consequences for your reputation."

  Grey eyes narrowed. "You have no proof of any wrongdoing on my part."

  The barest breath of silence, as everyone in the room absorbed those words. Still walled away from Malfoy by the headmaster's shimmering barrier of magic, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were holding their wands at ready, a killing rage in their eyes.

  "If I had," the Headmaster said, every word precise, "you would no longer retain possession of your wand. Or your faculties."

  Harry shivered, although he didn't know why. Dumbledore's voice had been even, and perfectly calm. But for a second-

  /It felt like a shadow passed in front of the sun./

  Malfoy was pale.

  Unruffled, Dumbledore continued. "Yet we don't need a conviction to topple your reputation, and I find myself almost hoping you pursue this. Now, /leave/." Harry couldn't think of anyone who would disobey a command in that tone of voice. Malfoy was no exception.

** From "That Terrifying Momentum," an AU in which Harry learns that the war against Voldemort can go even more pear shaped.......

​

You mean..." Scott said slowly, "...what if Voldemort builds an army and actually goes to war with the rest of the world?"

That was Harry's worst fears realised in summary, for if things reached that point he doubted that either he or his friends would survive to see it. "Yeah. Worst case scenario, I guess. What happens then?"

Scott grinned, teeth flashing in the dark. "Then the game changes. The old rules no longer apply. The war machine steps up, and puts Riddle down."

"No, that's what I'm saying. What if all those Muggle armies weren't enough?"

"/My/ war machine, Harry. Me. Us. The Kharadjai. The game changes -- the rules /no longer apply/. Voldemort steps outside of destiny. He wrecks the future. The Prophecy becomes irrelevant, /you/, I'm sorry to say, become irrelevant and there's nothing left but to do things the hard way."

Harry's eyes widened. "You would kill him?"

"Not just me. Imagine this: divisions of Kharadjai infantry dropping from the sky, the Fifth Fleet in orbit around your planet, and squads of Primares, guys and gals just like me, at the forefront."

"You couldn't hide that. There's no way, everyone in the world would know you were here," Harry protested.

"That's right. You think it would be the first time? There are any number of places out there where they know who we are. We've occupied planets before, Harry, and we'll do it again."

** Damn it all, but now he was good and curious. Someone Draco thought was weirder than Art? Preposterous. As Draco wandered off to round up his usual crew of miscreants, Art peered over the top of his book and studied the girl from across the room. Daphne was her name, apparently. Black hair elegantly done up, her uniform tidy, and her posture picturesque as she read her book.

She looked regal enough, but there had to be something more at play here.

Against his better judgement, Art stood and crossed the room towards her. She looked up from her book, raising an eyebrow at him as only truly pretentious people could pull off convincingly.

"Hey there. Daphne, right?"

Daphne tilted her head at him slightly, her face otherwise blank. "I hardly think the two of us are on a first name basis, Crouch. From a family as esteemed as your own, that's quite the breach of etiquette."

"What?" Art said, blinking as he interpreted that. "Uh... Sorry, I guess."

She scoffed, but stopped frowning at him in disapproval like an angry school matron. "You guess. Subpar, as apologies go. Nevertheless, you may consider yourself forgiven. With that out of the way, what business do you have with the ancient and noble house of Greengrass?"

Art slowly looked around, expecting Draco to jump out and let him know it was just a social experiment.

This was what he had been talking about? This hoity-toity high society speak? A bit more than strange, that was for sure. Try-hard, more like.

"Well?" She said, clearly starting to get impatient. "I do hope you haven't approached me with nothing of value to say. That would bode poorly for our future dealings."

Bode poorly for their future dealings, would it? What a load of bollocks.

Art knew he shouldn't have listened to Draco.

Still, this warranted a response of proportionate snark. Suppressing a grimace, he crossed his arms, puffed out his chest, and summoned his most flowery and meaningless arsenal of vocabulary.

"Indubiously, young madame Greengrass. 'Twas quite boorish of myself, to be so utterly forthrite with an acquaintance of such high regard and coming from such old and venerable stock. Prithee forgive mine own lapse in judgement, that we might leave this most inopportune of errors behind."

There was a small silence. Daphne squinted at him, her rigid posture forgotten for a brief moment as she mouthed a few of the dumbass words he had used.

Finally, she made an attempt to collect herself.

"Quite right, good sir... On this occasion, we... er," she said, mumbling and fidgeting slightly. "That is... Irregardless, we oughtn't... Forsooth? Shit."

She froze. Then she clapped a hand to her mouth, her face going pink.

Art allowed himself a grin of triumph. "Forsooth, indeed."

Still blushing, Daphne glared at him and quickly stormed off, making for the girls dormitory. No doubt she would return to him one day. With a heart full of vengeance and an even bigger vocabulary, she would challenge him once more.

Art nodded solemnly. He would have to be ready.

Looking down, he realized that she had left her book. Not a big shock. Blowing her mind with his dazzling array of words had left her pretty flustered, if he did say so himself. Had she really said irregardless? Honestly.

Still, best to be polite and return the book. That way she may only harbor part of a grudge.

With a sigh, he picked it up and glanced at the spine.

  This is a Self Insert. He's a bit of a grouch and doesn't like people, but he also hasn't had any friends for a while so he might be willing to give it another go. He's never seen Harry Potter or read the books. But it's a children's series, so it'll probably be fine. His name is Art. Artorius Caecilius Crouch, to be exact. But don't call him that or he'll get sort of annoyed.

  "Will Hogwarts be safe without Dumbledore? Will you be safe?

#+end_quote

Taken from Chapter 27 of [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6635374/27/][Regards, Harry]] the 2nd book/AU HBP version of Moment of Impact story series by Suite Sambo. It is my all time favourite fanfic by a mile and there are times where I dearly wish it was canon.

Basically context here is Harry and Severus Snape forges a mentor/mentee relationship (which goes into father-son by halfway in Regards) and here Harry just found out that Voldie was the person who cursed the DADA position. While Canon Harry hoped for another death, over here death of the DADA professor is pretty much Harry's nightmare scenario. Also, over here Harry and Minerva knows Dumbledore is near death. He had just written a letter to Severus asking the above and Severus was wondering how to reply/reassure him without mentioning this was likely his last year at Hogwarts (or maybe last year of life)

** My favorite lines come from the ending of [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18LfF7F3kBx7FpHUIa_FMGTDvnChrEaN9][Faith and Understanding]] by Lethe Laguz

This is the chronicle of Ginny's friendship with Luna, with Ginny's musings therein.

It's funny, it's heartfelt, it's goofy, it's sweet. Ginny and Luna argue and tease and confide in one another.

This is my favorite one-shot Harry Potter fanfic ever.

The closings lines are absolutely beautiful:

#+begin_quote
  Ginny often got her guessing games wrong. Who could really predict someone like Luna? She seemed above earthly things as much as she seemed to understand them better than anyone.

  It didn't matter, though. When Harry asked Luna to Slughorn's party, Luna's smiles were brighter than ever as she bounced around wondering whether she should wear her butter beer cork necklace while Ginny assured her that there wouldn't be any Nargles at the party. Ginny couldn't have been happier for Luna, and so it was all right if she didn't understand the Quibbler's latest theory about the Rotfang Conspiracy.

  As they laid in the grass one day in a rare moment of luxurious laziness, Ginny decided to play one last guessing game. Just one last question. And a rather personal one, at that.

  "Luna, who's your favorite person?"

  She felt the grass tickling her bare feet as the obvious answer entered her mind almost immediately. Luna's father, her most talked about person, the person she believed without question, no matter what he said. They surely had a wonderful family relationship.

  But Luna smiled her brightest smile and twitched her nose in that rabbit-like way of hers.

  "You are."

  Ginny leaned her head back and smiled. She was shocked once again, but that was fine. She didn't think she would ever understand Luna completely--nobody would. The girl was an enigma, bright and mysterious as the moon. But that was okay.

  Because Luna was Ginny's favorite person too.
