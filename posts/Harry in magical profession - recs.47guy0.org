I'd love to read more fics featuring Harry in a magical profession, with that being central to the story. And by magical profession, I mean one that doesn't really have a non-magical analog. The ones I can think of wound be cursebreaker, enchanter, wandmaker, spell designer. Maybe Unspeakable. Not auror, that's just magical policeman/soldier. Not teacher, even of a magical subject. You get the idea.

And while this would obviously be post-Hogwarts, I'd prefer post-war as well. I generally find defeating Voldemort to be the least interesting aspect of any fic.


** I have a great recommendation but, it is very much slash. In case that's an interest of yours: linkffn(4109630)

*** Actually, I've read that one before, I have it bookmarked! It was great.

And yeah, I meant to include I have no problem with slash. Or het, or a story with no pairing.

** Harry is a magical glassblower in linkffn([[https://fanfiction.net/s/6435092/1/Turn]])

Fem!Harry is an apprentice potion maker in linkffn([[https://fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense]]) but there's a lot more going on than new magic/potions discoveries. She does discover a new method of brewing in the second book but it does feel like chemistry a lot of the time otherwise.

  One good turn always deserves another. Apparently. Epilogue compliant/AU. HPDM slash but some canon het along the way. Please trust me - I promise the epilogue will not bite you.
