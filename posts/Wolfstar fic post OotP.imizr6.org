Does anyone know of any fics where Sirius either dies and comes back or doesn't die at the end of OotP and that's the trigger for them getting together? I can barely find any


** There was a "Bring Back Black" challenge back in the day, and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works?utf8=%E2%9C%93&commit=Sort+and+Filter&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=kudos_count&work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=Bring+Back+Black+%7C+Sirius+Black+Returns+From+Beyond+the+Veil&tag_id=Sirius+Black*s*Remus+Lupin][the tag for it on AO3]] is a pretty good place to start.

  Summer, 1999. Harry comes home with news. Quite a lot of news. Harry takes a deep breath.“I'm quitting the Aurors,” he starts with, which is followed by a moment of stunned silence.“What?” Sirius says.“All right," Remus says. “Do you know what else you want to do? Did you think about it?”Harry blushes, the way James used to---a rosy glow lighting up his brown skin---and says, “I wanted to---that is, I thought I might be a teacher.”Remus, quite suddenly, seems to have something in his eye. "Oh."“What?” Sirius says.“And uh---there's more. I was thinking I might like to. That is. I want to become an Animagus.”
