It's a Triwizard fic, and he doesn't go to Hogwarts, instead staying with the Dursleys. At some point he gets a job that involves woodworking, some kind of workshop.

#+begin_quote
  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.
