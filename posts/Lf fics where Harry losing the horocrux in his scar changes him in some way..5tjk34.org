  After the defeat of Voldmort didn't turn out quite like he envisioned, Harry stared into the Abyss preparing to prove something to himself, instead he tumbles into an experience he never expected, and he doesn't go alone.

I found this story to be very unordinary and I loved the premise. It's an avengers/Harry potter crossover with Bruce Banner as the main character and an insane/broken Harry due to the loss of the horcrux if I remember correctly.
