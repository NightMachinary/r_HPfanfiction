Anyone got any Ron Weasley centric stories with little to no romance? I enjoy dark theme, comedy, and hurt and comfort. But really just want some good Ron Centric stories to read that decently long like 20k and up.

And that's why! That's almost 3x what Rowling wrote in all 7 books, and close to 2x ASOIAF(so far).

While I'm super impressed at the word count, period? I'm in awe at meeting it in two years of writing. I'm just not at all interested in reading it. That's ~4k words a day. Fuck, the story should be told by now. But it's only moved 3 years since the story started.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.

  How would the wizarding world be different if Charlie had let his adventurous side take over a little early? A story where Charlie meets some muggles, Ron gets a work ethic, and all of the changes that happen as a result. I only have one pairing cemented, the rest will be up to how the story progresses.

  An unsung hero haunted by the loss of his brother's love. An overshadowed youth abandoned by everyone he ever loved. Why the enigmatic Lady of the Lake chose these two as her new champions against the growing threat of the Dark Lord--or why she chose now, of all times, to do so--is beyond anyone's rhyme and reason.But the Lady does what she wants. All Ron Weasley and Regulus Black can do is hold on for the ride.AO3 Exclusive. Canon Divergence starting from GOF's Parting of Ways.

  Ron Weasley was a sidekick. He knew what everyone said, despite many believing him to be stupid. He was Harry Potter's best mate, a part of the supposed Golden Trio. So nothing too bad would happen to him, right, being a sidekick and all? He'd always be there, ready for the next round. Wrong. Ron is unprepared when he is attacked by a vampire just a few weeks before sixth year.

** The Red Knight is one of the more popular ones. Ron travels back in time, but to an AU that wasn't his. Incomplete, but has comedy, action, and a bit of mystery.

#+begin_quote
  When Ron Weasley realized he was reborn to the world with his memories mostly intact, he felt it was a second chance to do better. However, he slowly realizes that this world was different from his own. Making new friends and earning new enemies, he has to use his experience from his previous life not only to reach his goals, but also to survive. AU

  Ron maybe accidentally-on-purpose becomes a dark wizard, and everything changes. (a canon rewrite, with a bit of a twist)(also this is not a 'Ron is Evil, actually' fic so if that's what you're expecting, maybe give this a skip)

  ‚ÄúThese children that you spit on, as they try to change their worlds, are immune to your consultations. They're quite aware of what they're going through.‚Äù --- David Bowie. . .Ron Weasley pockets the diary in the dungeon, because he has no idea what it is, or what it does(he never did get a glimpse of it, beforehand.) Tom Riddle inhabits the 13yr olds mind and sees something far more extraordinary than whatever the Potter boy or Granger mudblood could ever hand to him, no matter on a silver platter as nice as this one. . . .

  Wizarding Britain had long since vanquished Voldemort's darkness and had been born anew. But all it takes is a butchered unicorn in Leicester Square to set the past and present aflame. For what happens when Harry Potter can't save the day? --- Ron-centric Auror mystery, Harry-Ron friendship, and canon ships.
