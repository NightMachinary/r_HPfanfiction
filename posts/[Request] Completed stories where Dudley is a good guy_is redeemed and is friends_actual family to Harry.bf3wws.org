It can be during Hogwarts or post Hogwarts. I'm just looking for complete stories where Dudley realizes he's a massive douche nozzle and gets his act together so he helps Harry.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10493620/1/Ruthless]]

It's a tiny side thing with Dudley, but it's a short fic and VERY much worth the read.

James Potter places a spell on Harry to always make good decisions, but what magic itself thinks is "good" doesn't always align with human values.

Along the way, Harry puts a stop to the bullying and even helps Dudley bury a body.

** I asked this question several months back, here's what I found:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11456392/1/Proud][Proud]], Petunia died before she tells Vernon about magic. He's not suddenly become a good father figure or something, but Dudley and Harry is really close here.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]], Harry is blind and Dudley became protective of him.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4113087/1/A-Different-Fate][A Different Fate]], Harry becomes mentally challenged after the killing curse, Dudley became protective.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3446796/1/][Magical Relation]], Dudley is a wizard and goes to Hogwarts. Dudley's a jerk earlier in the series but he and Vernon becomes better later on.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9969014/1/Seasons-of-change][Seasons of change]], Harry sent Dudley a christmas gift on his first year, that started to fix his relationship with Dudley. Very Heartwarming.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3073562][the family evans]], Petunia raises Harry like a son.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10566861][the family potter]], The Dursleys died on Halloween, Dudley is raised by Lily and James.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13189407/1/Very-Big-Dursley-Family][Very Big Dursley Family]], Lily's protection makes every household on Privet Drive a big loving family.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6142629/1/Dudley-s-Memories][Dudley's Memories]], Dudley has a witch daugther, Harry goes to visit him. This is also a prologue of the best Snape Redemption series I've read, I suggest you also read it.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11923249/1/Cousin-Harry][Cousin Harry]] and the sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11958198/1/Uncle-Harry][Uncle Harry]], shorter but similiar concept with the above.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird][little0bird]] creates a massive next-gen slice-of-life series where Dudley has a witch daughter.

There's many other fic with the concept '/Dudley has a magical kid/' but I find the other too long, boring, and repetitive after a while.

  What if, when Petunia Dursley found a little boy on her front doorstep, she took him in? Not into the cupboard under the stairs, not into a twisted childhood of tarnished worth and neglect---what if she took him in?Petunia was jealous, selfish and vicious. We will not pretend she wasn't. She looked at that boy on her doorstep and thought about her Dudders, barely a month older than this boy. She looked at his eyes and her stomach turned over and over. (Severus Snape saved Harry's life for his eyes. Let's have Petunia save it despite them).Let's tell a story where Petunia Dursley found a baby boy on her doorstep and hated his eyes---she hated them. She took him in and fed him and changed him and got him his shots, and she hated his eyes up until the day she looked at the boy and saw her nephew, not her sister's shadow. When Harry was two and Vernon Dursley bought Dudley a toy car and Harry a fast food meal with a toy with parts he could choke on Petunia packed her things and got a divorce.

  Lily remembered her sister, how there had been a time she was curious and delighted about magic, before it slowly sank in that she could look and not touch.The last thing Petunia had said to Lily before she died was a chilly goodbye, ending a holiday dinner where they'd had a shrieking row in the entryway. Petunia had said 'freak' and Lily had hissed 'better than this, better than this being my whole fucking world, Tune, do you even see yourself, are you happy--'And now here was Dudley Vernon Dursley fussing himself to sleep as Lily walked the halls of the Godric's Hollow house. His tiny soft hands with their tiny soft fingernails curled under her chin, the same way Harry's always had.She passed James, who was gently bouncing his way up the hall the opposite way. "I think he's asleep," James mouthed over Harry's tousled head. His hair was the same mess, his head bent down as he peered at his sleeping son.Lily stopped where she stood, her nephew heavy on her chest, her husband smiling, her sister buried. "James," she said. "How are we going to do this?"

  Instead of letting Vernon in on her sister's little secret, Petunia worked diligently to keep magic as nothing more than a fairytale. However, when she dies unexpectedly, leaving her husband a widower shortly before that fateful Halloween night, Vernon doesn't know what he's getting himself into when he takes Harry into his home. AU. COMPLETE with epilogue!

** - Holly Wycliff series by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Forest_of_Holly/pseuds/Forest_of_Holly][Forrest of Holly]] (starting with linkao3(1048010)).
