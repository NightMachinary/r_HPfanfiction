Are there fanfics that are generally considered the best and true to canon/a continuation of the series? I find myself really sad when thinking about Harry Potter, I think partly because of how they're basically trapped in time in my head. I think reading fanfic that basically is a continuation (even far in the future) would help if it feels accurate.

Thank you, I hope you have a good day ðŸ’™

** Northumbrian's [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Nineteen Years and Beyond]] series is canon-compliant and will keep you busy for a while. You can read the stories in any order.

All the Young Dudes, mentioned earlier, is a beautiful, heart-wrenching story, but departs from canon in giving Remus a different backstory, and also making werewolves sensitive to silver, so it might not fit your request.

*** One more vote for Northumbrian as generally very faithful to the canon.

** linkao3(All The Young Dudes by MissKingBean89)

I know it's a cultfic at this point but it is canon to me now and nothing will change that.

It's a Marauders era that follows Remus from 1st year to OoTP. It's just the right amount of funny and tense and heartbreaking and warming all at once. It has some of the best character development I've read. I was completely absorbed by it. It's really marvellous.

And slots perfectly into Canon ðŸ˜Š

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise!
