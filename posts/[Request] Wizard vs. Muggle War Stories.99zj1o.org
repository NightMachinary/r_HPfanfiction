Has anyone read any good stories where the statute has been broken & the Muggles have not only become aware of the wizarding world, but actively try to destroy it, leading the various factions in wizarding Britain to band together to fight back against the muggles?


** Rise of the Wizards by Teufel1987. It has Muggle VS Wizard War after chp40. Savior Of Magic by Colt01. It also has Muggle VS Wizard War after the defeat of Voldemort.

*** That's what I always assumed. However, one would think that with muggle world leaders needing to be made aware of the existence of magic, they would have developed safeguards against the imperius of their heads of states.

**** World leaders don't all know. If the Prime Minister example is the norm, they're only told when magic is involved in national security issues. And even then, Snape implies (indirectly) that you need to be magical to resist Imperius. He says that Occlumency is the "magical defense of the mind" and that it requires similar powers as throwing off the Imperius.

***** Also, even if the world leaders were guarded against the Imperius it wouldn't help much since you can mind-control their staff and successors and replace them.

****** Yep. And when Imperiused the controller can order them to act normally, that's why it was so terrifying in the First Wizarding War.
