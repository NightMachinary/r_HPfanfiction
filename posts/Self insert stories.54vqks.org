Any good Self- or OC-insert stories? Bonus points if the inserted character keeps interaction with the 'golden trio' to a minimum.


** I really liked [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9399640/1/In-Bad-Faith][In Bad Faith]]. Insert as Draco's little sister.\\
linkffn(9399640)\\
Unfortunately it's abandoned and never even gets to Hogwarts.

Here's another which is an insert as Luna's older brother.\\

Hasn't been updated in awhile though. And I don't think it's a true SI but I honestly can't remember.

  I never pretended to know what I was doing in my last life. Why should I pretend to know anything about this one? Well, the other option is a horrific and bloody death, so...I better start learning how to be a witch. OC Self-Insert/Draco's Younger Sister. [DEAD]

I don't know that I've ever seen an SI successfully avoid them.

That said... [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-perks-of-survival-hp-si.311621/][Perks of Survival]] manages to have the SI be too wrapped up in his/her own issues to really work on the trio's stuff.

The SI wakes up as Sally Anne Perks, and since the only thing they know about that character is that she's MIA by the time OWLS roll around... panic ensues.

  Most self-inserts are exercises in vanity, and nothing says 'vanity' quite like Gilderoy Lockhart. But with a new personality and knowledge of the future, who knows? Maybe Lockhart will turn out to be a useful DADA teacher after all.

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.

  It was eleven AM on a Saturday and I was sitting at the desk, spreading a disappointing Vegemite substitute across an equally disappointing piece of gluten free toast. The only thing that wasn't innately disappointing was that I'd made a very good cup of tea. It was still steaming in my giant, garish mug and I was counting on it to make this breakfast worth getting up for.Less than an hour later, Lucius Malfoy would be trying to convince me I was his long lost daughter.

*** How is this an Insert story? Not saying your story is bad, just that it doesn't seem to fit the topic. OC insert doesn't just mean there is an original character in the story, it specifically refers to some character being reincarnated in the HP(or other fandom) universe with memories of their past life, typically said past life taking place in our universe where they have read harry potter and thus have knowledge of the plot.

Its basically a plot device to have a character with knowledge of the story that doesn't involve time travel.

***** Yeah if you aren't familiar with the trope its not necessarily obvious from the title.

So a self insert is inserting yourself in the story, as many people like to imagine what they would do if they were characters in the story. And that term was coined first I imagine. However many people probably wouldn't actually be a good fit or do anything particularly interesting if inserted. So some authors that liked the idea of writing a self insert, but didn't want the character to actually be themselves, wrote similar stories, just with an original character with whatever traits they wanted the character to have. This was named OC-insert.
