A sad, yet common occurrence within HP fanfiction is that authors, as well as readers alike tend to view muggles as superior to wizards; this is mostly do to the fact that Muggles outnumber wizards, or Science and I could go on for a few paragraphs disproving this, but that's not the point.

Anyone who has read Wolfwalkerron's fics, or The Marriage Stone will have some concept of this, and the type of fics I'm looking for. I'd like fics (Preferably Harry-centric) where Harry learns that Wizards Are superior. This doesn't mean that he has to be Dark, or side with Voldemort (Though, those are certainly acceptable).

Slash is preferred, but I will read Het as long as its not H/G or H/Hr.

Thanks for any help


** Rise of the Wizards, one of the best fic I ever read.

*** LOL thank you very much, but I've read that one twice. Plus, in all honesty I'm not a huge fan of fics that move dates around for the sole purpose of making things easier.

Don't misunderstand, I've fudged a few dates myself, but never outright changed them
