I recently read "Harry Potter and the Forced Hero" and I was wondering if anyone knew any similar fan fics?

A fic where harry is abandoned and grows up on the streets of London, only to be found by some part of the Wizarding World when he is older, be it Dumbledore or Voldemort, but is very against having anything to do with them?


** maybe this might suit your fancy? definitely not as hardcore as the one you read but the concept is relatively the same and its one of my favourite fanfictions of all time

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5411398/1/A-Lonely-Path][A Lonely Path]] features a Harry who is found at age 14 and is resistant to the idea of magic (though, after skimming the summary of Forced Hero, this Harry's not so hardcore!). It's so far focused mostly on the relationship between Harry and Remus. linkffn(5411398)

  At age ten, Harry disappeared. Four years later, a suspiciously familiar boy is found. Remus accepts the task of reintroducing him to the wizarding world, Harry resisting all the while.
