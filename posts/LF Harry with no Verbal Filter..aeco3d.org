A Harry that, if he thinks Malfoy is a Cunt, he calls Malfoy a Cunt. Actively says what he thinks of someone, regardless of how anyone in earshot might take it.

*** There was supposed to be more swearing in the later books - especially from Ron - but JKR's publisher nixed it and said she needed to keep the language in all seven books at the same level of kid-friendliness. That publisher, of course, was a wanking nutsack.

******* Wow...strange that she didn't stand her ground...seriously, swearing is ok - unless you do nothing but swear, but IMHO that is only teenagers who have just discovered that there are bad words and who use them to provoke adults!

As long as you do it only when you are reacting to a bad situation (or if your emotions bubble to the forefront of your mind and - temporarily - shut down your filter)? Yeah, ok!

ps: Trying to protect your kids from bad words is ridiculous!
