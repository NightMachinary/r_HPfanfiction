As the title says.

I've just finished reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10150152/1/Through-the-Veil-Strangely][Through The Veil]] by littlewhitecat, and I love fics where Harry goes off on his own adventure (usually off-screen) (through his own decisions or involuntarily) and when he finally arrives at Hogwarts, either as a firstie or later, he has some expert-level knowledge in something unknown to what's taught at Hogwarts or has incredible power in something other than wand-waving. And everyone is consistently, repeatedly perplexed at this version of Harry and his antics (except for Luna, usually).

Crossover fics have a lot of this, but unless it was published in the last two years, I've likely already read it or just had no knowledge of the other fandom to be able to even understand it (I can't make heads or tails of Game of Thrones). Overpowered Harry is probably a given on this. I don't have many hang-ups on character-bashing or if he's dark or what-have-you.

Bonus points if it's not Harry, but Ginny, Hermione, Draco, /or/ Snape who arrives at Hogwarts with this new power/knowledge. Or a whole little gang of them.

I know this request might cover a lot of genre ground in this fandom (I've read plenty of them!), but I absolutely love these kinds of fics and would love to hear everyone's recommendations.


** linkffn(The Tinkerer by wickwynn), kinda.

Vernon recognizes that computers are going to become big in the future. He gets Dudley one. Dudley is not interested. Harry is, and he proceeds to spend every spare moment of the next couple years playing around with it, culminating into some kind of program.

They try to sell it to IBM but get rejected. They happen to run into Bill Gates in an elevator on their way out (he was there for a meeting or something, idk.). He is interested. A deal is made, Harry is a child millionaire, and the sensationalism of a small kid coming up with this makes him world famous. For some unfathomable reason, the Dursley's are more appreciative of this Harry. So while they don't love each other, they get along. Harry goes to Hogwarts as a kid accustomed to fame and fortune, and all the muggleborn kids recognize him.

Harry is kinda OP in that he seems overly adulty and socially savvy, but the fic was pretty good from what I remember.

#+begin_quote
  The Dursley family, who valued normalcy above all else, would of course never dream of keeping their orphan nephew in a cupboard, or of making a spectacle of him. That isn't to say they wanted to spend all of their time and money on him, however. From the salvage of broken toys and unwanted junk, left alone to his own devices, Harry built dreams.

*** Read a couple chapters. Seems kind of meh after a while, honestly. But absolutely kept me entertained for a few hours yesterday.

It feels a lot like Methods of Rationality, but Harry isn't as arrogant and is actively doing his best to fit in. There's more worldbuilding with the wizarding side of things and a lot of depth there, but when the fic talks about wizarding history, it gets textbook-like at times, and those blocks of text can turn me off from a story.

The dialogue feels a little stilted at times, but I'd guess that most people could get used to it and accept that as being just how Harry talks. It got a little annoying later on. For some reason, some aspect of the dialogue made some scenes fall flat in my opinion.

The 'power' in this fic is written in to be rather subtle, like slight tweaks to what wizards already have, but it is notably different, with Harry being hailed as a sort of genius (and his anxiety at that kind of burden). I love what they did with Hufflepuff. Not sure about the secret parties and secret quidditch, but okay.

** There's one where Petunia marries a less shitty guy and Harry does a bunch of stuff before Hogwarts mostly off screen and then he arrives at Hogwarts with unknown knowledge and everything goes crazy. Hermione has some of the power too and they team up to figure out how to use it and Draco wants it too and Harry teaches him in secret while also trying to teach him how to be less bigoted. Then later on it turns out that Voldemort had the power too and it's really scary because it makes him powerful way beyond Dumbledore.
