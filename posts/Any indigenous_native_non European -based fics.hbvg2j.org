Like the title says, any fics of any length that explores the magical systems of places that aren't based on the predominant magical cultures that we got a glimpse of in the European schools of magic? In particular, native and indigenous systems would be awesome, but I'm down for any other cultures and systems we didn't see much or any of in canon.


** FILFY teacher by Vimesenthusiast this is a crossover with high school DxD that has many different types of magic mixed (sometimes with explosive results) though it has harry x multi, dad harry, and werewolf harry
