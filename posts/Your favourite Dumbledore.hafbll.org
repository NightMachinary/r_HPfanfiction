Fanon has given us so many different versions of dumbledore and I just wanted to find out everyone's favourites Mine has to be alcoholic dumbledore from magicks of the arcane


** Well, I once read a crack fic where Dumbledore was posing as Gandalf so that he could use Frodo as a drug mule.

It's been /years/, probably over 10, since I read that fic. I don't remember its name or even what it was about but that one scene has stuck in my head after all these years simply because how ridiculous it was.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

** Well so far i enjoyed the Dumbledore seen in 'Brilliant, But Scary' and his scene at the end of year one especially. Still wip though so my thoughts might change as the story develops.

*** I think the Greater Good Dumbledore thing is interesting.

Because almost everyone would go along with the greater good philosophy - as long as they don't get the bad hand.

If you /have/ to choose between ten innocent people and one thousand innocent people dying, then the vast majority would choose ten people dying. Now, if you have to make them kill the people personally, then the willingness to answer changes. And if you have to choose between your ten closest friends and one thousand innocent strangers dying, those numbers drop even further. Not to mention if you combine the two...

Anyways, Greater Good Dumbledore is someone the vast majority of people would agree with except that we relate to Harry, so the idea of Harry being used as a sacrifice is very much a "would you kill your best friend to save a country of strangers?" and my answer to that is uwu

** It has nothing to do with canon, nor does the fic feel like it has actual stakes, but the Dumbledore of "Core Threads" has a special place in my heart. He's basically suffering from a magical form of dementia (everyone knows and acknowledges it) and despite that, does his level best to fight the good fight. However, "fighting the good fight" with magical dementia makes you look not so much as a clown, as a three-ring circus, it turns out.

My absolute favourites have to be the following:

- Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay: linkffn(13230340)
- The Amplitude, Frequency, And Resistance of the Soul Bond: linkffn(9818387)\\
- Albus and Harry's World Trip: linkffn(13388022)

All three have Dumbledore as a goldmine of comedy, while still being entirely competent.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** Or short notice without haveing to Think about it much the Dumbledore from Linkffn(What's a Little Death between friends?) comes to mind. I am sure there has been other that I like more. But I cant remeber them at this time.

#+begin_quote
  After the defeat of Voldmort didn't turn out quite like he envisioned, Harry stared into the Abyss preparing to prove something to himself, instead he tumbles into an experience he never expected, and he doesn't go alone.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13517055/1/Tracey-Davis-and-the-Boy-Wonder][Tracey Davis and the Boy Wonder]] Dumbledore is fully willing to confund someone for a laugh. More specifically, he confunds Hermione to bring Harry to Luna instead of Tracey and watches the drama that unfolds.

** I have two. The first is the one from Hermione's Furry Little Problem where he realizes that he was in the wrong when it came to Harry and does what ever he can to make it up to Harry.

The second is from a fic I can't remember. I remember that the first in the series has Harry get tossed through the Veil after Voldemort wins and lands in a parallel universe where Harry is Rose, Bellatrix is her God mother and not insane, and Sirius is Fem!Riddle's Bellatrix. This universe's Dumbledore is simply old and denial. His important meetings are just watching his stories with Figg.

** There's a fic I enjoyed where a parallel version of Dumbledore took over for the canon one and the canon Dumbledore was forced to watch and accept his own incompetence.

The competent alternate Dumbledore is my favourite.
