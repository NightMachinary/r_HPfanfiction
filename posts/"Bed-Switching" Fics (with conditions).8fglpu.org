This has unintentional bed switching between Harry and Hermione, mildly funny and sweet.

** You could make a case that the smut in the first chapter of this story is rape (it is definitely non-con, initially), but, to be fair to the MC, its definitely unintentional and this request kind of makes it hard to avoid.

** There's no such thing as "as non rapey as possible." There's no in between, between not rape and rape. It either is or it isn't, and when it is, it's horrible and wrong. Please don't try to justify or excuse your erotic interest in rape situations. What you want to read, and be excited over, is rape.

*** To be completely fair, rape fantasies are common in both men and women about equally. So long as it never leaves the realm of fiction, I don't personally see anything wrong with it.

But, to clarify, what OP is asking for is two people mistaking each other for someone else, likely their respective partners. In such a situation, who would you call the raper? They both made the mistake.
