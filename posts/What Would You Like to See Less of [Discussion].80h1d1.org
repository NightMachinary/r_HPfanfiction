So I've read about 200 HP fanfics now (discounting those I dropped quickly), and at some point you begin noticing a lot of common plots, story/world elements, themes, goofs and turns of phrase that have become popular to use. So as the title says, what of these would you like to see less of?

At this point, I can summarize some of the things that disinterest me (sometimes enough to drop the fanfic) in just a few words.

-"Lord Potter" if I see these two words that's virtually guaranteed to make drop immediately. It sounds ridiculous, and it can get even worse occassionally, when I see "Lord Potter-Black"; nope nope nope.

-"Gingrotts knows the truth!" Nearly always paired with the above. It's a banking system, why is it involved directly in these political power transfers???

-"Dumbledore was secretly being a douche all along" Again, often paired with these he above two, to the point where sometimes stories have Dumbledore siphoning funds from the Potter vault just so he can live well. Dumbledore was annoying in canon, but this has become unbearable for me, at least when done just because we're told Dumbledore is greedy or something.

-"Magical guardian" Why why why is this a thing? And sorry to sound like a broken record, it's common for it to be mixed with the Dumbledore thing above to explain why he could access someone else's vault. Why would a school headmaster be allowed to be the legal guardian of arbitrary students at his school? Guardians have to take care of their charges. If one is going to do this sort of thing, how on earth is Dumbledore getting away with not running afoul of a wizarding CPS with regards to Harry?

And to be fair, since my interest in HP fanfics is overwhelmingly with H/Hr shipping, it perhaps causes me to see these related story elements a lot more often. But that said, I'm sure those with a broader interest in HP fanfics have noticed other irksome (or at least overdone) commonalities they'd like to see less of.

** Anything including OP!Harry, LordPotterBlack!Harry, Independent!Harry, Superrich!Harry, Grey!Harry, InTouchWithHisInnerSlytherin!Harry.... Basically if Harry is super-powered and "better than canon" in every way. These sort of fics are a large part of why I hardly ever read Harry-centric fics anymore.

I'm so sick of authors treating Harry as their wish-fulfilment borderline Gary Stu character. It never leads anywhere interesting; usually it's boils down to Harry acting like a huge unlikeable douchebag, and I'm supposed to cheer for him and think he's SO COOL because he talks like a thirtysomething American action hero and treats the author's least favourite characters like garbage.

Oh, and double points if the fic has him adopt a "never forgive, never forget, never show mercy" policy and slaughters, cripples or permanently disfigures anyone who even /thought/ about not supporting him 100% of the time, and the author justifies this by using the word "nazis."

Hiring a would be murderer (Lockhart was trying to wipe Harry and Ron's minds in order to get away), because you want to play 'expose the fraud' instead of doing your job as a Headmaster is pretty shitty. It's not my fault that Dumbledore's other failures are even worse.

is it that unlikely? As far as I can recall, there's no canon method of writing checks, and their society is purely cash-based. When their largest denomination of coin (the galleon) is worth Five Pounds per Rowling, that makes paying for anything such as a house, jewelry, or any expensive item completely unwieldy. The only sensible solution we can extrapolate with the knowledge at hand is that the goblins are involved in brokerage, which gives them a /hell/ of a lot of political clout.

**** There are at least two professional works that do quantify it. "Naruto" and "The Inheritance Cycle"

In Naruto we're given the relative magical reserves of three people rather early on. The first one have sub-par reserves but above-par control. The second one have above-par reserves and average control. The third one have huge reserves and sub-par control. Here your control can limit how much magical energy is expended as we see a bit later on as the first person uses the right amount of energies to do something, while the second one wastes a bit of energy and the third one uses almost three times as much. Magical energy here is basically compromised off of Physical and Mental energies.

In "The Inheritance Cycle" It is as simple as you expend as much energy doing something with magic as you'd have to expend to do it without it. Meaning that more theoretical things, such as creating light or pinching nerves, are easier and more enduring than throwing boulders around. A workaround with this in a combat situation is to extract energy from enemy soldiers.
