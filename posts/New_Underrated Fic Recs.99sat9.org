I'm in the hospital for a long stay and have exhausted pretty much every HP fanfic commonly recommended (and just about all the decent ones that have more than 1K favs) on [[https://FF.net][FF.net]]. I want to support new and unappreciated gems, but am having trouble finding interesting fics that fit this category. I found one with great potential recently, but it took me reading hundreds of horrible first chapters to come upon it.

Are there any stories you love or are currently following that are languishing in obscurity? I'm happy with any type except crossovers and Girl Harry (I just can't). Slash/het/whatever doesn't matter so long as it's an interesting story with generally correct grammar and real plot. I really appreciate any of your suggestions.

** The series [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12241647/chapters/27814206][The New Skin]] by Mottsnave

It's gen fic, first-person POV about Snape surviving the war and leaving Britain without anyone knowing he's still alive, save for a few people like Aberforth Dumbledore and Kingsley Shacklebolt. It took me only a couple of paragraphs to adjust to the first-person voice, and I was pretty impressed by the 128K-word opening to the series. It's intelligent, carefully thought out, attentive to details, makes great use of Snape's potions skills and general experience as an undercover agent, and spins an inventive plot.

It's also a fascinating, complex portrait of a stoic, paranoid, abrasive, brilliant, guilt-ridden character obsessed with potions research and with avoiding detection. This isn't a version I'd call recognizably "Snape," and the story does read more as original fiction to me than as HP, partly because it's more realistic and not very whimsical, but it's so well extrapolated that my doubts just feel like personal bias.

It's different from any other Snape fic I've read, and the prose is quite good. If you're not put off by first-person POV or by being in Snape's head for thousands of words, I'd highly recommend it.

**** How closely does he resemble canon Snape's voice? Hm, not that close. Of course, the book version is through Harry's eyes and ears, and I do think there's room to expand on Snape's interior language and thought processes, but that's why I mentioned it's not recognizably Snape. All the pieces fit, but the voice is several degrees more competent, self-aware, and mature than canon Snape. The flaws still exist in abundance, but the character voice and narrative intelligence are very different. I'd say this Snape is 'inspired by' canon, but not perfectly voiced, no. I decided after the first chapter that I was perfectly happy to go along for the ride, though.

** It's not new but I don't see it recommended on here often. linkffn(Dudley Dursley and the Quest for Truth) if you can suspend some disbelief it can be potentially Canon compliant (don't know if that's important to you or not). Overall it's a solid story about the Dursleys living in a safehouse during the war and how Dudley learns to appreciate and even like magic while making friends with the muggleborns that are hiding there too. My biggest complaints with it are that it really stretches the extent of magic in canon and it throws in minor characters like they're candy.

Edit: so i just looked through the story and now I'm really confused. I completely thought that the story ended differently. I distinctly remember the group, including Dudley, going to Hogwarts after the battle was over and explicitly remember a scene about him realising Colin Creevey died and Dennis being told. But that's not in this story apparently so now I need to figure out if I'm thinking of another story's ending or if something was deleted

** Linkffn(Old Blood): a dark Harry, still in 1st year. Fairly AU story still.

Linkffn(Antithesis): another dark Harry story, this one with a WBWL trope

Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes): basically this is PoS but with the tropes played straight and not as a subversion.

Linkffn(Realignment): not really /new/, but it is definitely under-recommended in my view. Harry goes back to assassinate Tom in '43, and the only one who can stop him is Dumbledore himself.

Linkffn(The many deaths of Harry Potter): Harry Potter, groundhog day style.

Linkffn(Days to Come): a more believable post-canon story than I usually have encountered with a non-canon romance.

Linkffn(Like a Red-Headed Stepchild): Harry has red hair, mostly crack but well-done. Check the authors other works as well.

Linkffn(The Changeling): finally completed, and two sequels have already been put out in the last year. The first was a bit underwhelming, though the second was a definite step up.

Linkffn(Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary): Luna got the diary instead, sort of crack/sort of not.

Linkffn(Perfectly Normal Thank You Very Much): one of the most enjoyable iterations of Dudley has a magical child that I have yet to encounter.

Linkffn(Heart of a Lion): a decent Founders era fic, book 1 of a trilogy, and the author recently published the first chapter of another story.

  The Battle of Camlann never happened, thus the legacy of Arthur lives on. The blood of the founders still walk the halls of Hogwarts, while ancient enemies clash to this day. Years later, Harry Potter wakes up a stranger in a strange world. Between over competitive house relations and never ending mysterious plots, he must struggle to find the truth about that fated Halloween. AU

** linkffn(Bad Oracle by we-built-the-shadows-her) This is a new fic that has been quite good so far. It's a story involving Delphini (from cursed child) who has been using a time turner to go back to Harry Potter's time to influence events to her liking. It's mostly from the perspective of Dumbledore, Snape and Harry Potter as they have to deal with this random girl who appears out of knowhere. She claims to be a squib and seems to know just about everything about them but isn't very cooperative with them or their plans. Things get quite interesting once she resurrects Lily Potter.

I haven't read the cursed child so I can't say how true she is to her character, but she is entertaining in her own very meta ish way and her interactactions with the main characters.
