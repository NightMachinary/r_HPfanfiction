**** Yea, not sure what that story is doing in a thread called "*Best* Harry/Susan". I mean it is Harry/Susan, but it is also pretty bad overall. Plot holes, OOC'ness galore and the writing is subpar too. At least it was for the first 10-15 chapters, after which I gave up.

***** This argument (shouldn't be here because its bad) works for pretty much 99% of all 30k+ words Harry/Susan. There's like 2 fics are actually good with this pairing, the rest are either Ok, or really bad.

IMO, the only good ones are Worth of a Soul and Final Protocol.

****** Well, there is good, ok'ish, bad and then there is this fic... I am not saying that it should not be here because it does not count to the best 20 Harry/Susan fics. I am saying that megamatts works are Shakespeare level compared to this.

Also in addition to the two fics you mention, where I am in agreement, they are pretty good, I would also mention "The Forgotten Contract" by James Spookie. He is usually known for his believable Harry/Daphne fics, but I enjoyed this Harry/Susan fic a lot too. At least I did a few years ago when I read it and my memory is not playing tricks on me.

I thought the same, when I read, it was so nice. I went out of internet for a couple weeks this year, and this was one of the fics I had downloaded on my phone. And let me just say that while still being better than 95% of Harry/Susan, its so bland, Harry is that kind of Harry where he's clueless and then turns into McLovin because he "lacked" confidence. Kinda like all fics with Neville as best friend of Harry with Ron Bashing, you know?

The plot is generic, Susan is completely interchangeable with any other character and only serves as a gateway for Amelia, the concept of the Power Of Love in here is really cheesy, Harry is a Gary Stu and Voldemort is as bad vilain as in canon . I will say that it has great battle scenes, Dumbledore is nice (which is rare) and Amelia is by far the best character in the fic. Overal, top 5 Harry/Susan by w/o. All of this, ofc, is my opinion.

  What if Harry Potter was sent to Azkaban for killing Cedric Diggory? What if a Hufflepuff questioned his conviction?
