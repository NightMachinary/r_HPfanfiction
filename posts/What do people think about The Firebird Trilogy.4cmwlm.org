**** Yeah that whole 'punishment' thing against Hermione during a Christmas break seemed /way/ too brutal. And it seemed out of character for Hermione to lay down and take it - she's supposed to be fiercely independent and competitive (that's why she's Gryffindor, not Ravenclaw), but maybe that was just the impact of her bond. And it made the ending even sadder when the punishment became the impetus for Hermione's departure - especially when it was established throughout the story that H/Hr was a closer, more friendly pairing than the exotic H/L (H was close friends with Hr for years, the first time they met & touched magic, etc., while H/L was forced by necessity/politics and they didn't truly meet until book 2).

** It reads like a pureblood writing allegorical propaganda about mudbloods stealing our magic, but using gender rather than blood purity. It does as good a job as you'd expect from, say, Draco Malfoy: no nuance, not well thought through. The worldbuilding is pretty awful: a handful of ideas tacked onto the HP universe like gluing a horn to a dog's rump and calling it a bull.

Like, women are supposed to be the top dogs in society, but men determine when to create clans. Who decided that?

Men are rare, precious commodities, and they take marriage bonds until they can hardly use magic. They're tasked with defending their wives. Who can use magic at full strength, which means they can defend themselves against hordes of men. This is stupid and inconsistent.

Men are allowed to do dangerous things. But maintaining a population is a concern, and men are in short supply.

Even low-status women don't consider marrying men who can't use magic.

It's implied that the birthrate by sex problem is relatively recent, but there are a ton of traditions surrounding it. How does that work?

I seem to recall there was a problem with schoolchildren getting bonded. Why not teach and house them in separate locations? That would ensure that no proscribed pairings occur.

Men are taught to use magic, but they'll just get pushed into marriage bonds until they can't cast a spell. This despite Voldemort's rebellion. Why not have a different school just for boys?

Men using wands have a reduction in magical power. This reduces the number of marriage bonds they can support. If you didn't teach them to use magic, they wouldn't use wands, and there would be more available marriage bonds to distribute.

Artificial insemination is never proposed. Not even the modern medical procedure -- nobody thinks to take a person's semen in their hand and insert it into their vagina in order to have a child outside a bond.

Two-mother pregnancy is not proposed. I know that's a very recent development in muggle science, but magic tends to solve a wide variety of problems with a lot less research or effort necessary.

I don't think sex-selective abortion or any sort of spell to influence a child's sex is proposed. That would allow people to spend less time on pregnancies that produce daughters -- even with just sex-selective abortion, if the sex of the foetus is random, that means another chance to have a son a couple months after conception rather than 1.5 years.

It's as if nobody in that society bothered to give the slightest pretence of being concerned over major societal problems. Not enough to try to solve any of them, even in an idle and blas√© fashion, or /something/ would have been done. Since this is a work of fiction, only the author is to blame. Bring in the obvious agenda and it all falls flatter than unleavened bread.

#+end_quote

You are aware that roughly half the human population doesn't have a Y chromosome, right?

If you're referring to the process of creating sperm cells, let's look at one of the early examples of producing a mammal from all-female parents:

#+begin_quote
  [[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v428/n6985/full/nature02402.html][Here we show the development of a viable parthenogenetic mouse individual from a reconstructed oocyte containing two haploid sets of maternal genome, derived from non-growing and fully grown oocytes.]]
#+end_quote

That is, they took two or more mouse eggs and produced a living mouse from them. It's implied that they produced a viable diploid cell directly from eggs rather than trying to generate sperm as an intermediate step. -- Actually, based on that wording, I think they took a follicle and a mature egg. Close enough for a lay audience, right?

#+begin_quote
  remove all of the female mtDNA and replace it with male mtDNA.
#+end_quote

Humans do not have sex-linked mitochondria variation. (Bivalves do, but you're not a mollusc, are you?) If humans did have sex-linked mitochondria, that would still only make it harder to produce male offspring from female genetic donors. Given one or more healthy female genetic donors, you have all the mitochondrial variation you need to produce a functional female offspring.

You might object that this doesn't solve the population problem because it's only producing women. But there's no logistical problem with having an all-female population. /Aspidoscelis uniparens/, for instance, is a species with only female members. Our hypothetical human population is in better shape than theirs because /Aspidoscelis/ is using parthenogenesis and we're using a form of reproduction with two genetic donors.

I understand not wanting to do any research yourself. It takes effort, and we all have things to do. In the future, though, if you can be more specific and clear with your objections, that would speed things up. I have no idea why you'd need to "artificially recreate a Y gene" in order to produce a daughter from two mothers, and if you had explained that, it would have been less work for me.

#+end_quote

Okay, looks like it's time for a basic biology lesson.

The X gene is something that gives you superpowers and a scholarship to Professor Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters. It does not exist. It would be awesome if the people at the Tokyo University of Agriculture had invented a way to produce the X gene, but sadly we're stuck in reality.

Chromosomes are long strands of genetic material and are the common unit of genetic inheritance. They usually come in pairs, where each member of a pair of chromosome has all the same genes as the other member, just different variants sometimes. Humans have 23 pairs.

In mammals, there are two chromosomes that are a bit different: X and Y. They can pair together, or an X chromosome can pair with another X chromosome. Most of the time, when someone has one X and one Y chromosome, we call them male, and when someone has no Y chromosomes and two X chromosomes, we call them female.

With people who have normal, functioning ovaries, these ovaries contain a lot of little "follicles". These follicles are immature egg cells. They have one copy of one chromosome from each pair that humans have -- 23 in all. We call these "haploid" cells because they have half the chromosomes of the source organism.

Since people with functioning ovaries have two X chromosomes and no Y chromosomes (barring certain chromosomal anomalies), each follicle has one X chromosome.

A similar process happens with the production of sperm. Sperm cells also have one copy of one chromosome from each pair. But since people who produce sperm typically have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome, a sperm cell can have one X chromosome or one Y chromosome.

If you successfully combine two haploid cells, you will end up with a diploid cell. A fertilized egg. It develops into an embryo.

In nature, this happens when a sperm cell meets an egg cell.

In the process invented by the Tokyo University of Agriculture, it happens when a specially prepared follicle is combined with a mature egg cell.

There was no need for an artificial X chromosome. They had one from the mature egg cell and one from the follicle.

#+begin_quote
  That study shows only haploid cells.
#+end_quote

Tokyo University started with two haploid cells and combined them into one. They used an immature egg cell, a follicle, in place of a sperm cell. The follicle provided genetic material in the same manner that a sperm cell provides genetic material.

They created a mouse using the process, as you would have realized if you had read the twenty word excerpt I quoted for you, or if you had read the abstract.

[[http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2004/04/mouse-two-mothers][Here]] is an article with a photo of the mouse they created, if pictures are more your thing than words.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

You need to provide a source for this.

That should be obvious to you. You've been asking me to provide sources. It should not be astoundingly unthinkable that you have to provide sources for your claims too. It's basic fairness, which is taught in kindergarten.

Every source I've found says that paternal mitochondria die off fast after fertilization ([[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21998252][source discussing method]]), that there are a thousand mitochondria from the egg cell for every mitochondrion from the sperm cell ([[http://www.pnas.org/content/93/24/13859.full.pdf][source]]), that paternal inheritance of mitochondrial DNA via sperm [[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2716-mitochondria-can-be-inherited-from-both-parents/][is rare]]. That implies that most sperm cells contain mitochondria with DNA sourced from a woman.

Even if your claim turns out to be true, it represents an engineering challenge to be overcome, not an insuperable barrier.
