Cue daytime soap opera music.

Will also accept fic recommendations with this premise.


** This reminds me, sickeningly, of that one fic I read where Ron was with this beautiful chick in these graphic sex scenes, totally in love with her, only for it to be revealed at the very end that it was FREAKING GINNY all along! I have never wanted to leave the internet so much.

*** Well, as long as they both consent and they don't have children, I don't see a problem.

I mean how could it be worse than Harry/Lily Evans? People on this sub will often upvote requests for this.

** I remember reading a fic years ago that Lily was actually Molly's daughter as Molly had been raped by Dumbledore(?) while she was still in school. I don't remember how they handled the age differences but as I said it was years ago.
