I'm guessing that if someone asked Rowling, she'd say "no", but its never exactly addressed in canon. We just know that it kills without causing visible injury, and that no one but Harry has ever survived it.

On the other hand, modern resuscitation techniques are recent (presumably No-Maj) inventions, so its possible that relatively few wizards know them. They also aren't guaranteed to succeed (especially CPR alone, without additional medical treatment which wouldn't exist in the magical world), which means if they were tried once or twice on a killing curse victim and failed, it would just reinforce the belief that no one can survive the killing curse. After all, no magic can bring back the dead, and most wizards probably take the view that if something can't be done with magic, it either can't be done or isn't worth doing.

I just like the idea of their being at least a few things that the non-magical world can do but magic can't, and this could be one of them, since there's just enough wiggle room in canon to leave it up to author's interpretation. And of course, there's a fine tradition of non-magical loopholes to "inescapable" mystical fates, such as:

-Shakespeare's Macbeth- No man of woman born can harm Macbeth. He's killed by Macduff, who was delivered by Caesarian. Similarily, Macbeth will not be defeated until the forest marches against him- then his enemies carry tree branches to conceal their strength.

-Tolkien's version of the "no man of woman born" prophecy- The Witch King is prophesied not to die at the hand of man. He dies to a woman and a hobbit.

-Buffy the Vampire Slayer- Buffy is prophesied to die, she drowns and Xander brings her back with CPR.

-Buffy again- the Judge is a demon that can't be destroyed by any weapon. But that was hundreds of years ago, and Buffy blows him up with a rocket launcher.

Of course, it depends on how the killing curse works. If it does it by causing instant brain death or something, then that's that. If it just does it by, say, magically stopping someone's heart (which in the old days was considered synonymous with death), then it might be reversible.

Incoming silly theory.

All the Unforgivables are variations on the same spell. Imperious attacks the brain with subtlety, allowing control, but it's defeatable as a result. Cruciatus attacks the brain with power, causing extreme pain. Killing curse attacks the brain with precision, causing instant brain death.

** I always thought it caused soul detachment, to pass onto the afterlife as a literay foil of dementors who destroy the soul, but not the body. Simply because of JKRs writing about afterlife.

With more though on the topic, it would make sense for an AU to say the killing curse kills the body, but dementors affect the soul.

** Well in my mind, the effect of the curse was to turn you from alive to not-alive no matter how it's done from a scientific point of view. However since no clear canonical explanations are given of how it works, you may have a bit of room to play with the concept in your fic.

*** One option that has occurred to me is a variation on Buffy's prophesied death- Harry dies, which is magically irreversable damage and therefore destroys the Horcrux. But someone (most likely Hermione, because she's a well-informed Muggle-born) revives him with CPR, leaving one Horcrux-free Harry.

** Given what we've seen of it in canon, I wouldn't have thought there would be enough time - it seems fairly instant. What I always think though is that it should be possible for people to protect themselves against an AK by conjuring up a big animal of some kind, and putting it in front of them so that the killing curse hits the animal instead.

In canon, the magic system is a conceptual one, it doesn't follow the laws of science but its own set of rules. This difference is very important in /how/ the magic works :

- In the manga/ anime FMA, Roy Mustang create flames by adjusting the oxygen level in the Atmosphere, and then igniting it with a spark created by his special gloves. The "Alchemy" of the manga follows the rules of science, and Roy Mustang is unable to control flames if he is unable to create a spark (because he is wet as an example), just like he would be unable to create a fire in a vacuum.
- In Harry Potter, a wizard just as to use "Incendio" (or any other fire spell) to create a flame. It doesn't matter if the wizard is under water, or if the material is fire proof, if you use "Incendio" on something, it's on fire.

With that in mind, the Killing Curse doesn't "kill" someone by some cause, but just "make him dead". Which is why there are no known counter. It's not just a matter of having his heart stopped or something like that, but being dead by every sense of the term.

I also want to point out that, while the Killing Curse" kills without cause any physical injury, it doesn't mean it kills without a trace. As Dumbledore said, "/Magic leaves traces/" and the victim of the Killing Curse may be very easy to identify thanks to the magic traces left in them. The fact that an injury caused by Dark Magic can't be healed (like George's ear) and that the Killing Curse is one of the Darkes Magic probably means that someone killed by it can't be saved at all.

*** As I understand it, the thing with curses in Harry Potter is that the spell damage can't be easily repaired (ie George's ear couldn't be regrown because it was cursed off). Unless you happen to know the specific counter curse, and there obviously is no counter curse for Avada Kedavra.

So, the question is, are curses irreversable by any means without the counter-curse, or just by magical means. Like, if a George had gone to a Muggle hospital, could a doctor have sewn his ear back on, or would the curse somehow have prevented that?

In OotP, Arthur Weasley tries a "Muggle way" to treat his injury (stitches). This method fail because the poison left in his body melted the thread, and while Curse are not poison, I like to think a similar thing would have happened to George. Maybe his ear would not have reconected to his body despite a "succesfull" procedure, or maybe the thread used to sew his ear back would have rot. The point is that, because he was hurt by Dark Magic, he can't be healed.

For a time, I wondered if injuries caused by Dark Magic could not be healed by removing the injured part before healing it. As an example, Dumbledore has a curse on his hand? Amputate his whole arm and then grow it back. In the end, I decided that such method should not work (in my opinion), because it just feels cheap. An easy trick for the heros to heal from an "unhealable" injury that was somehow never discovered by generations of healer (including Muggleborns and Muggle enthousiasts) but easily found by a teenager.

Honestly, it just because I don't like the trope of Harry healing himself with a Muggle trick, but if I absolutely had to find an explanation, I guess I could say that Dark Magic also let a trace on the soul of its victims. Magic is used to "return people to normal", but because of this magic, the injured state is now their "normal" state, which is why it can't be healed.

***** Eh, I'm fond of magical dooms having non-magical loopholes. I did think of the snake thing, but that was due to the venom as you said, and the fact that they even thought to try it suggests that the idea of using Muggle medicine isn't obviously doomed to fail.

Speaking of "removing the injured part", I've wondered if a Death Eater defector could try that as an admittedly drastic way to remove the Dark Mark.

** We know there is a concept of souls in HP verse, with this in mind I see two possible options:

Killing Curse expels the soul from the body, once that happens, there is no way back. Like Dementor's Kiss. There is a cheat - if soul is somehow tethered to mortal realm either via Horcrux or Sacrifice (Harry's mum).

The other option is if the curse causes instant, severe damage (though unnoticeable on the surface) to the body (and Fake Moody mentions that underpowered wizard could cause a nosebleed) - then question is more interesting, could you repair the body and retain the soul inside? Again, it would seem that Lily's sacrifice, when Harry chose to return either "fixed" his body, or delayed the damage.

However, since there is no definitive answer it is up to individual fanfic writers. Though I would caution against making it too cheap. Would rob the curse of its horror if you could undo it easily.

*** I tend to discount the "remove soul" option, because as you said, there's something that does that-Dementors. And it doesn't kill the person's body, even if it could be argued that the person is dead for all intents and purposes.
