Hello!

I would like to know if there is any fic where a Dark Harry has a child or adopts one and is seen raising him.

I doesn't have to be the main focus of the fic, just that it happens. Also I don't want a "light" family, it has to be a Dark one, for example, voldemort raising a kid. Or if not a Dark one, at least one that allows both dark and light magic, a grey one.

I don't want Harry to be that kid, he has to be the one that raises the kid, or at least is his godfather.

A example of something like that is "The Nightmare Man"

Thanks!

  At 30 years old, divorced, and headmaster of Hogwarts, Harry Potter doesn't have the life he'd always dreamed would come after defeating Voldemort. A chance discovery in the Chamber of Secrets allows him an opportunity to go back in time and change some things. Wherein Harry---now Hadrian---raises his younger self, dances the political dance with Death Eaters and a resurrected Tom Marvolo Riddle, and searches for a way to stop the destruction of the magical world.

  Harry and his friends ingested love potions; great - he could deal with that. But knowing that he found this out before and the people he trusted sent him back in time without his memory, to relive his past, again and again? Not this time if he had anything to say!

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  Dumbledore thinks he will rescue Harry from his terrible family, setting himself up as Harry's mentor. Unfortunately for him, somebody else got there first. BAMF!Harry, M for violence, language, child abuse/prostitution, drug use, and all around criminal goings on.

  Iris Potter-Black never thought that she would find herself literally tripping through time. Not one to let an opportunity go to waste, she decides to meddle, and meddle big time. Adopting Tom Riddle was not supposed to create a young Voldemort completely obsessed with and extremely possessive of her. Her presence definitely wasn't supposed to attract Gellert... (rest inside)
