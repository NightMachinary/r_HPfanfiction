So, I'm looking for a stereotypical American, or just an American in general. It can be an oc, or any other character, I don't care

Like they bring all 13 guns they own or asking where the weight room is, getting McDonald's at the great hall, bring a pit bull or something.

No bashing Please no bashing

Any pairing


** Probably not what you're requesting, but Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle by Inverarity is a wizarding-in-America story. Actually, it's a series. It takes place a decade after the British wizarding war and triumph of Harry Potter over Voldemort, but has almost nithing to do with Harry Potter, apart from taking place in the same world with the same rules.

â€‹

I love it and its pretty long, too. 5 books of 7 are completed so far, with the fifth being released in bi-weekly installment on FFN.

  This started as a short story about how nerd weaponizes light. Now it is 'how quickly can we cover the entire Harry Potter series while adding progressively more technology and research into the mix.' Still a stupid story for the sake of stupid stories, though. Enjoy

  Ever dream of ending up in your favorite book? Think that sounds pretty awesome? Well you're wrong. Time travel sucks, alternate dimensions suck, and trying to raise young wizards without getting yourself killed and accidentally letting the bad guys win really sucks. But getting to give a kid the childhood he needs? Well, that just might make it worth it.
