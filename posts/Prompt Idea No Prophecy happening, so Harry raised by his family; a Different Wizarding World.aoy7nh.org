The prophecy is self fulfilling. Let's say that Snape hadn't of heard part of the prophecy right then and there, and so Voldemort would have no reason to go after Harry or Neville and their family.

Harry wouldn't be a Horcrux.

But it wouldn't be simple, Voldemort wouldn't have disappeared for years; there'd be a different version of the Wizarding World; or at least UK, by the time Harry is 11.

Would Harry be allowed to go to Hogwarts? Would Hogwarts even be there at that point? Maybe Voldemort was able to take over Hogwarts a lot sooner?

Maybe James, Lily, Harry and maybe even other families from the light side were forced to go into hiding?

There could be a bunch of different ways that the no prophecy could bring.

No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione, any other pairing is fine.

If more than one person wants to write this idea, go ahead! Like I said a bunch of different ideas could be taken from this.


** Technically the prophecy then could still refer to Harry or Neville as neither one would be marked yet.

*** It could even refer to someone else entirely. The prophecy doesn't unambiguously say it's about a newborn baby, it's just Voldemort interpreted it that way.

*** True, but if Snape or another Death Eater hadn't of heard that at that exact moment, Voldemort wouldn't have tried to attack the Potters at that exact moment, leading to Harry becoming a Horcrux, and his "defeat" for several odd years.

If he hadn't of been "defeated" who knows, he could be a lot further along with the control at this point in a different timeline.

Like I said, the prophecy is self fulfilling, if Voldemort had ignored it, or hadn't of even heard about it; things could have turned out very differently indeed.

**** Oh yeah completely agree, not arguing that point at all, just who the prophecy would mean. Because realistically it only gets triggered once he marks someone (even unknowingly). Would be interesting to see what would make him actually see someone so young as a threat without knowing the prophecy though.

Do you think the power he knows not is still Love though? Or luck? Perhaps family? Or actually something properly magical?

***** Mhm; the power he knows not would be interesting if it was still love... though perhaps done differently than in canon? Or family would be good as well.

It'd be interesting if it was something actually magical; but for someone like Voldemort, who has never known love or family, it'd be nice to keep that part close to canon (imo).

** That's kind of what happens in Prince of the Dark Kingdom. Harry's parents fled with him to Germany before he could find them. Fast forward ten years and we see what Voldemort has built.

** Yes Snarky this sounds like such an interesting idea for an AU magical world!!! :) Especially if Harry's parents stay alive. :o

*** I just think that there's so much you can do with this idea!

Like is Dumbledore still alive? If so how involved is he with the war? Is he still Headmaster at Hogwarts? Is there even a Hogwarts anymore?

How far has Voldemort gotten? Are no Muggleborns allowed in the UK? So no Muggleborns allowed in Hogwarts?

Would other states get involved and try to help? Et cetra. Harry wouldn't be a Horcrux, and he'd have the love of his parents on his side; but there'd still be so many things that you could do with this idea.

And what's great is, you can have like three people write it, and they'd all come up with different ideas for it.
