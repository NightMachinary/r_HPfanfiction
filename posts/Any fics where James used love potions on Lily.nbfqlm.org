#+begin_quote
  Lily hated that toerag James Potter until suddenly she didn't and they were madly in love. What if it was a love potion?What if she was set free the moment James died?What if that was enough to make her switch sides?(Starts angsty, then gets a bit cracky)

** Need me this fic, but in the manner of Lily has a /giant/ kink about it, and James is at once happy that she gets so randy and mortified/sad at the idea that he married for love and still needs a love potion to get laid.
