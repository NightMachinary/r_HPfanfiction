So far from what we've seen the magical world doesn't change much over time but they do adopt muggle inventions like the wireless that are useful.

So by the 2020s I'd expect there to be some magic phone and internet equivalent. Online shopping might force some shops in Diagon to close. Brooms would be even better than what we know of. Apart from that mostly the same. Hermione's super memory becomes useless as everyone can now access Wizardpedia.

What changes do you think could happen by 2050? By 2100?

Genetic engineering in the muggle world causing another wave of blood purism?

Wizarding communities around the world being impacted by climate change?

A group of goblins causing international political trouble by saying screw wizards and establishing a new cave city on Eros?


** Well, seeing as wizards are quite a few decades behind muggles on adopting things, like in the series, wizard radio is a thing but not television. I think that by 2020 wizards would be using a wizarding form of TV, but not many would be using the internet. However, the Ministry would have to be much more well versed with muggle stuff, as it would be very easy to break the statute of secrecy using the internet, so they would have to have a charm or something for that.

*** Early 2000s maybe, but imo the internet is way too useful and versatile for it not to be a thing in the magical world by 2020. There's going to be hundreds of wizards who use muggle technology trying to create a wizard version, and whoever first figures out how to make a phone work around magic or create an enchanted object that works like a phone (maybe magic mirror as basic component, protean for communication, logic and text processing off the Marauders's Map, omniocular video storage system as memory) is going to be hugely successful.

** I think they'd be exposed and struggling to integrate with humans. Everything is on connected databases, and there's only so many times where you can miss one asshole with a camera phone before people start believing. Plus all the cctv and surveilance tech locals control now.

*** Yeah, I always figured it was just a matter of time before someone stumbled into a magical fight while their live streaming. Or someone looks through all the photos they have in the cloud that they have no memory of taking that clearly show someone using magic.

******* The first book is a pretty good take on the story. The second, I didn't think much of the actual plot, but the exploration of what magic might be able to achieve was interesting. The third is pretty short, wrapping up loose ends.

** Elon Musk is actually a wizard, and Hermione works with him on interplanetary colonization. Their goal is to have a world for wizards themselves and any Muggles who follow them.

Daphne Greengrass marries Jeff Bezos and they are working on their own pet projects. There is a very good reason why [[https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass/][AWS Greengrass]] exists.

*** You know, if SpaceX had a few wizards they could totally have probes and people all across the solar system without anyone noticing. And that doesn't even require anything except for a magical equivalent of Kerbal's "infinite fuel" cheat. One self refilling spell on the fuel tank and a Crew Dragon can go to Mars and back in a few days. SpaceX already has all the other technology needed, except for a huge rocket cause in reality they don't have infinite fuel.

***** Obviously the ideal cover for a top secret magic space program is a muggle space program. Perfect excuse to hire tons of engineers, and the best get to know about magic and work on the real program.

I'm planning a fic which involves a magic space program. I can't figure out how to give it a good antagonist though.
