I'm looking for a fan fiction about what happened at Hogwarts during their 7th year when Harry, Ron and Hermione are out hunting Horcruxes. If one exists. Thanks!

linkffn(11419408)

Both are excellent.

** If you are interested in alternative year 7 fics, here are some:

*Harry Potter & Death's Ultimatum*, linkffn(8286141): Both Ron and Hermione left Harry in the tent, and things actually turned out a lot better?

*The Seventh Horcrux*, linkffn(2818538): This fic was written BEFORE Book 7 came out, and it got lots of things right.

*What If?*, linkffn(7671626): Another re-write with Ginny joining the Trio.

*** Can't recommend. Characterisation is awful and the story is very over the top often. The above mentioned Not From Others and A Call To Arms are much better.

**** I always drop this warning when this fic gets recommended so here we go:

The author of this fic is manipulative, abusive, and known for taking vulnerable members of his fan communities and starting cults. There's a LOT of information on him out there if you're curious.

So, if you enjoy the fic that's one thing, but PLEASE don't engage with him on the internet (tumblr especially). He wants a large fan following and actively cultivates one and uses it to find vulnerable women to manipulate and I just don't want more people getting hurt because of him.
