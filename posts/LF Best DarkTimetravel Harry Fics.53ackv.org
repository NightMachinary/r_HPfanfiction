I'm in the mood for fics where Harry, for whatever reason, goes back in time and either joins Voldemort or becomes some sort of dark lord/killer/not a good person. I don't want any fics where Harry is dark but sides with the light, please. Thank you.


** When you say 'dark lord/killer/not a good person' how graphic are we talking about? I mean Harry isn't exactly good in [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1161859][House of Snakes]], but he also doesn't do anything that is /that/ bad either. But in something like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10182397/1/The-Nightmare-Man][The Nightmare Man]] Harry tortures Lily to insanity, kills lots of people, and raises a zombie army.

So I'm just going to suggest a bunch of stuff with not-light Harry joining LV. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/Again-and-Again][Again and Again]] comes to mind. In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6985795/1/Xerosis][Xerosis]] Harry time travels and joins LV and basically takes over everything. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3999286][FeS2]] was inspired by Xerosis and has a similar storyline. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10724291/1/Stand-Against-the-Moon][Stand Against the Moon]] by the author of Xerosis came about from FeS2, and has Harry as the leader of the non-human magicals in which they rebel. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9214710/1/The-Vitruvian-Man][The Vitruvian Man]] is an old favorite of mine with a nice developing relationship. Does it have to have time travel? Or can it be like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8704528/1/][Enveloped in the Darkness]] which Harry joins the darkside.

The Fictionist ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2227840/The-Fictionist][FFN link]], [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/The_Fictionist/works][AO3 link]]) has a number of HP/LV|TMRJ fics which fit without the time travel, like [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/934466][Solace in Shadows]] but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5725656/1/Fate-s-Favourite][Fate's Favourite]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5736901/1/Past-s-Player][Past's Player]] do have Harry time traveling (PP) or Tom and Co (FF) and are particularly excellent in my opinion.

  At 30 years old, divorced, and headmaster of Hogwarts, Harry Potter doesn't have the life he'd always dreamed would come after defeating Voldemort. A chance discovery in the Chamber of Secrets allows him an opportunity to go back in time and change some things. Wherein Harry---now Hadrian---raises his younger self, dances the political dance with Death Eaters and a resurrected Tom Marvolo Riddle, and searches for a way to stop the destruction of the magical world.

  Harry was left at an orphanage after his parents met their demise. There, he finds nothing but suffering until he rejoins the Wizarding World. Dumbledore may hope for Harry to be a kind soul, but he's made mistakes. And what he gets is a future Death Eater. Harry is Dark, Harry is ruthless, and he is siding with Voldemort.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. Story is high on Political intrigue.

  Getting stuck in 1942 was bad. Getting put into Slytherin was even worse. Having Tom Riddle practically stalk him? Harry hated his life. Prequel to Fate's Favourite. [ABANDONED.]

  You always get the stories where Harry goes back into Tom Riddle's time, then either stays or gets sent back. End of, unless he tries to make Voldemort good. But what if things went differently? What if, just once, someone followed a time traveller back?

  When Harry is kidnapped by a seemingly sixteen year old Tom Riddle at the end of his second year, he's convinced that he would do absolutely anything to escape -- but "anything" can be a dangerous conviction to have, and even heroes can grow tired of fighting without hope. Sometimes, survival means making a home in the dark...
