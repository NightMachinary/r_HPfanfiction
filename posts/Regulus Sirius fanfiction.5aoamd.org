Does anyone know any good fanfics where there is a positive relationship between Regulus and Sirius? Not slash just as brothers. Preferably if it's also a Regulus lives story but it's fine even if it's not.


** Highly flawed, but still interesting - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8895954][Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina]] is, despite what title may suggest, Regulus' story and features quite a lot of postive Regulus - Sirius interaction (and starts with Regulus surviving).

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

  It is Christmas of the year 1977, and Sirius Black is teetering on the edge of madness. When one careless deed brings his world crashing down around him, with far-reaching consequences, Regulus Black has to step in and help his brother piece together the fragments of his life -- if he can stop himself from being sucked into the terrifying vortex alongside Sirius.

  Regulus intended to stop the Dark Lord himself, but for some reason he's driven to share his discovery with his brother - a choice that saves his life. He'll have to live with the consequences of that decision and the knowledge that Sirius' problems have now become his own. What he didn't expect was being stuck raising his brother's godson. Rated T for swearing. AU.

  Companion fic to Seirios Aster's "Some Nights" Sirius Black did not take his brother's passing well; it happened a few months ago, and he's barely holding it together. And then, he sees something he thought he'd never see again ... But Regulus is dead, right..? Set three years after the Marauders graduate, roughly follows the timeline of Seirios Aster's fic, Light of a Fading Star.

  Sirius and Remus are in the library, and Sirius happens to notice that Regulus is sitting next to a girl. A little too close to a girl for big brother's comfort. So big brother proceeds to make a fool of himself.

  It's June, 1981, and Regulus Black certainly hadn't expected to survive betraying Voldemort. He knew he should avoid his former life, but he'd never been very wise, especially considering family.
