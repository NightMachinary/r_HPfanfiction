** "Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we'll find the perfect match here somewhere -- I wonder, now - - yes, why not -- unusual combination -- holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple."

Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls.

Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, "Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well... how curious... how very curious... "

"What's curious, you pompous old stork?" said Harry --- but he didn't really mean to say it, the words had just come out of his mouth under his ntoice. Somehow.

"I'm sorry," Harry quickly apologized, "I don't know why I said that."

"Oh! Oh! /You/ didn't say that, my boy," chuckled Ollivander. "You really haven't told him anything, have you, Hagrid? That is your wand speaking, Mr Potter. I did say wands shared a close bond with their chosen, didn't I?"

"Oh --- oh dear! I didn't think it was so literal." said Harry.

And the wand replied:

"You don't /think/ much, do you? Still, you seem nice enough for an owner. Yes, yes, I think we might do some good work together, you and I."

"Oh," Harry said, not knowing whether to be offended or honored by the wand's flip-flopping. "Thank you... I think?... What do I call you?"

"The Wand of Holly with a Core of Phoenix Feather." the wand answered. "But Holly would do."

"Alright, Holly. And, er, Mr Ollivander, what was /curious/?"

"Mostly, I did not think little Holly would ever pick an owner, after half a century. I had half a mind to take her appart and reuse the core elsewhere."

"/You wouldn't dare!/" Holly seethed through Harry's mouth.

"But then, it is also interesting, to say the least, that she would pick /you/. You see, the Phoenix whose is irising this wand gave one another feather... just /one/."

"Oh, /please/!" said Holly. "I don't want to talk about /Yew/!"

"Er... Weren't we just talking about me?" asked Harry.

"Not you, Yew!" said Ollivander. "The Wand of Yew with a Phoenix Feather Core. Holly's twin brother, if you will."

"Bah!" Holly huffed. "I refuse to be associated with that... that pretentious /git/ who went and bonded with the Littlest Dark Lord! I saw that kid's mind, you know, when he tried me, and it wasn't /pretty/!"

"When you say Lil'st Dark Lord..." said Hagrid.

"I mean that Tom 'Look I'm Good With Anagrams' Riddle nuisance, yes."

"Wait, you can read my thoughts?" Harry asked with concern, grasping on to another aspect of his wand's last statement.

"Of course!" said Holly. "Of course your wand can get inside your head! How else am I supposed to know if I want to bond with you? Or talk through you, for that matter!?"

"Er... your name is Holly..." Harry said, hesitating. "Are you... a /girl/...?!"

"I consider myself a female, yes," she said.

"*ICK!*"

"I'm quite sorry," said a highly educated voice in Queen's English, "but I must be the voice of reason and remind all participants that we are getting behind on our schedule."

"Hagrid!" Harry said in surprise. "Did you just say that?"

"Who? Me?" Hagrid said in confusion.

"Pfah!" the giant's lips mouthed, once again in their educated tone. "The idea. No, of course not. I am obviously the Umbrella. Do keep up, my boy."

** Harry was exhausted by the time he came home from Diagon Alley that he didn't hear it the first few times.

"HEY KID!" suddenly something in his pants shrieked at him, looking nervously at the door, he didn't /hear/ anything from the Dursley's... Were they out?

"Hey Brat! Down here?"

Harry found the source of the sound was indeed his pants... Was it... "First the snake from the zoo, and now my trouser snake? This can't be happening"

"No, you utter incompetent, I'm your bloody wand, when is the last time you washed these pants?"

"Oh."

The fire blazed merrily, the multicolor sparks adding something special to it. Harry only flinched a little when Mr. Dursley put a fat hand on his shoulder. "Glad to see you've come to your senses about all this rubbish boy."

** Harry woke from slumber, bleary eyed, and, upon remembering he had double Defense Against the Dark Arts today, already utterly done with the day. Resisting the urge to throw himself out of the window, and cursing the prophecy for apparently making that option pointless, he slid his legs from under the curtains and got out of bed.

After his blind search for his glasses, and upon putting them on, he reached for his wand, which he put on the desk beside his bed every single night.

Instead of meeting holly wood, his fingers met something slightly slimy and squishy. Harry withdrew his hand instantly and looked down.

It was Trevor, Neville's frog.

More peculiarly, it was Trevor lying on the spot he had always placed his wand. But his wand was nowhere to be seen. Assuming Trevor had kicked it behind the desk, he took a look behind the desk --- and under his bed --- and in his drawers --- and on his bed --- but it was nowhere to be found.

"What the...?" Harry murmured. "Trevor?"

Trevor's large eyes stared back at him, and then after a moment of a staring contest, he moved from his spot.

Harry blinked.

In the spot Trevor was sitting, where he placed his wand nearly every single night --- and definitely last night --- was a small, dark brown snake. He almost mistook it for his wand, and would have if not for the yellow eyes of the serpent now stretching itself out on the wood of Harry's desk.

Harry stared at the snake, bewildered, and backed away a step.

The snake hissed something, but Harry's mind was too all over the place to hear it.

"Er --- h-hello?" he said quietly, hoping not to wake the other boys in the dormitory with what he hoped was hissing.

The snake continued to look up at him with those disturbingly familiar yellow eyes. "Holly," it --- /she/ --- said. It had a distinctive feminine voice.

"Sorry?" Harry asked.

"I said /Holly,/" the snake replied, and Harry could have sworn she rolled her eyes, "not /Hello./ Honestly, it's not /that/ difficult. If I was able to Petrify at this age, I would seriously consider it. My owner or not."

"What?" Harry said dumbly.

"I figure that's the best name for me, is it not?" the snake said. "I suppose it's your decision at the end of the day, but Phoenix would be kind of a dumb name to give a serpent, would it not? Don't want to make yourself appear as stupid as you sound. And if you name me Eleven Inches, everybody's just going to assume you're trying to compensate for something."

***** I actually thought about including a bit where Harry barges into Ollivander's shop to ask about that.

** *Ollivander's wand shop, Diagon Alley...*

"Who said that?" Harry blurted all of a sudden, his first wand clutched in his hand.

Ollivander raised his eyebrow, "Who said what, Mr. Potter?"

Harry looked around, "I heard a voice...it was a girl, I think."

Hagrid turned and looked out the window to Diagon Alley, but there was nobody there pressing their snout against the window, much less being audibly heard through the thick glass.

Ollivander, however, looked thoughtful, "Hmm...Mr. Potter, how much do you know about how magic works? Have you ever seen a spell?"

Harry blinked, "Um, no sir. Just Hagrid pointing his umbrella at things."

Hagrid blushed; Ollivander, however, was paying no attention to him, "I see...well, Mr. Potter, do you wonder why you should need a wand in order to cast magic? To be precise, when you've proven perfectly capable of causing magical effects without one before?"

Harry thought back; to when he vanished the glass in the zoo, to when he had ended up on a roof, to when he had regrown his hair in one night, "Now you mention it...why do I need a wand, sir?"

Ollivander slowly started to pace around, "Well, as you may have realised, there are many different magical creatures in our world, like the goblins you no doubt met at Gringotts, and our remarkably intelligent post owls, up to dragons and unicorns and down to the humble puffskein. All of these beings and creatures, and some humans too, possess magic within their bodies, not their minds but their bodies, which responds to their desires to change them and the world around them."

Harry nodded slowly.

"While it is possible to train your body to respond to your conscious will, to be able to control these...happenings, it is very difficult and the benefits are very limited. Thus, near the dawn of civilization, before ancient Egypt, mankind discovered how to speak to spirits, who could reach out and change the world for them."

"And I need to learn magic words and wave my wand in just the right way because that's the language of the spirits?" Harry interjected.

Ollivander looked surprised at that. Harry blushed slightly, "Um, the voice spoke again, it said that...yeah."

That just made Ollivander look even more surprised, "That is correct, Mr. Potter. In the past, speaking to spirits to get them to grant man's wishes was a difficult process, requiring lengthy rituals filled with symbolism and oftentimes material offerings. Nowadays, however, we have managed to discover many forms of communication that these spirits use; what you will learn at Hogwarts is one such language, words, gestures and all, used by the culture that the spirit in your wand is from."

Harry and Hagrid looked down at their wands in wonder, causing the old wandmaker to chuckle, "Yes, I'm afraid the wands I create are not mere machines. Rather, they are akin to...I would say fishbowls. They house a companion spirit, one drawn to the wand like you would be drawn to a house furnished in a particular matter, and your time at Hogwarts will be spent learning how to understand each other."

"Blimey, I never knew!" Hagrid breathed.

"Not many people do. I do not bring it up often, most muggle-raised witches and wizards, and for that matter, pure-blooded persons don't seem particularly comfortable with the idea that they are consorting with spirits to cast their magic." Ollivander answered.

"But...mine is speaking to me." Harry said slowly, "She says she can understand what we're saying."

Ollivander nodded, "And that is truly remarkable, to have a spirit who understands humans so well. Listen well, and try to understand her as well as she understands you, and you will become a truly great wizard."
