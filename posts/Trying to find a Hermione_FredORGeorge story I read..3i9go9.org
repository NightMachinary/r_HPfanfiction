I can't remember if it was Fred or George but it's a romance with Hermione.

It's set during OoTP. Tired of Hermione's nagging Fred and George cast a spell on her to make her more relaxed but the spell creates a bond between her and F or G (it's only one of them). They have to be in constant contact.

Does anyone know this story?
