- Hello Tom.
- I am Lord [REDACTED]! ...


** For the same reason, it's pretty amusing for an outsider to hear two Unspeakables talk to each other. It sounds somewhat like this:

#+begin_quote
  "Hello, Dr. *‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà*!"

  "Ah, good evening, Dr. *‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà*. How was your day?"

  "Pretty good, we've been working on [REDACTED] and made some real progress. Although [REDACTED] keeps [REDACTED], so we had to [DATA EXPUNGED] for three hours straight... well, that's what Class-D is for."

  "I see. Well, I have to go now. I have to report to Director *‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà* on Project [DATA REDACTED]."

  "See you at ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà 's, then."

  "See you."

** Linkffn(the Arithmancer)

Hermione invents a reversible ritual in this fic that does this for an individual person. It makes it so the person gets their tongue stuck to the top of their mouth if they try to say a specific word at the cost of another word they might want to say.

But it can be reversed.

It can only be done for one person, but it would be funny to it to the whole population of Wizarding Britain.
