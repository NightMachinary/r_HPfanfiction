#+begin_quote
  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

** Narcissa Malfoy penned /A Case for Amnesty/ after the second wizarding war. Not many people were swayed, but it still sold enough to help with the legal fees. She tried to reach out to Andromeda after Bellatrix was gone, but Andromeda rebuffed her.

Rita Skeeter's photographer f---king hates her, but can't deny she makes him money.

Aberforth Dumbledore's “improper goat charms” were the result of a mental breakdown, during which his control slipped in dangerous and unpredictable ways---not unlike Ariana's. Albus had him committed to St Mungo's for a while, and didn't visit him during the stay.

Charlie Weasley has a handsome, personable Romanian boyfriend with a wicked sense of humor. They're gym bros together but also sweet and romantic. The Weasleys love him.

Monsieur Delacour must be one hell of a man, to have charmed a half-Veela into marrying him and staying by his side for so long.

** Demelza Robins is the daughter of Bellatrix Lestrange and was placed into the foster system after the Lestranges were arrested and Muggles searched their abandoned safehouse. In the system, she found a loving family and is completely unaware of her biological parents.

After the war, Harry adopted Delphi Riddle and raised her as Teddy's sister with only her, Teddy, Hermione, Andromeda and Ginny knowing the truth. Being called daddy by Voldemort's daughter turned out to be the ultimate revenge.

Susan Bones hates the Ministry and never got along with her Aunt Amelia.

** Charlie Weasley ended up with Rowan from /Hogwarts Mystery/. She (Rowan) and Harry became good friends. In the same vein,Cedric ended up with Merula and (a surviving) Regulus ended up with Penny.

Michael Corner comes of a long line of Parseltongues,but isn't one himself. His grandfather owns Terror Tours and served once in the Muggle government of the UK as a low level bureaucrat.

Tracey Davis' cousin accidentally bred the first (and so far only) kitsune.

Eloise Midgen married Oliver Wood and took up Ginny's reportage slack whenever Ginny was out of work.

Robert Scamander (my version of Rolf) loves Baroque music.

And you,the reader,were gay all along. /s :)

More stuff:

House Vane (Romilda's family) are technically the heir of Hufflepuff. They live in the old Hufflepuff family manse.

** Colin Creevey and Jimmy Peakes were a couple.

Daphne Greengrass deliberately remains in the background.

Lavender Brown survived Fenrir Greyback's attack, but was so ashamed of her scars that she retreated to the Muggle world.

Cho Chang married Dudley Dursley and they two daughters. Both girls are Squibbs, to Cho's relief and Dudley's minor disappointment. Petunia and Vernon never find out that Cho's a witch.

** I don't really have very many BLEEP BLOOPS! :) The only one is like about Leanne and Katie being gay girlfriends, and Cedric being bi and liking to write in his spare time. Like poetry or even stories. :) I have him do that in one of my fanfics, anyway. We did not ever get to see him outside of Quidditch and Triwizard stuff!
