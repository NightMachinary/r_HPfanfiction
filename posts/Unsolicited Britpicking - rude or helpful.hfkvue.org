I've been reading a lot of really great fics that I've had to abandon because of rampant americanisms. I always want to leave a mostly positive review, with a couple of notes on various inaccuracies (like "diaper" "fall (autumn)" "potluck", Petunia having a baby shower/wedding planner (given the time period, she would definitely consider them to be crass & American), "Gradeschool", Vernon & Petunia going to a "downtown steakhouse"...

I've always resisted the urge, because it feels really rude, and it's really my problem - I just can't stand being taken out of the story like that. But it's really frustrating as just a few small changes would make it bearable. Especially in a story where otherwise the author has made a bit of an effort.

So, how would you feel if someone offered some unsolicited britpicking?

(Side note, a lot of fics have "Mastery" of Potions/Herbology being a kind of career goal, I really think the "Potions Master" is just a riff on how British Public schools used to call teachers - there would be a History Master, Geography Master etc. Perhaps JKR has talked more about this & has clarified, but that's yet another thing that makes me roll my eyes. Google "The History Master is" in quotes and you will see examples of what I mean.)

** Well you need to remember that any fanfic author from outside of the UK may have read a version of the books that had a lot of the "Britisms" removed. I mean the US version even changed the title of the first book from Philosopher's Stone to Sorcerer's Stone. So they might not see anything wrong with what they wrote.

And I think any criticism would be welcome as long as it is constructive and polite.

**** I believe so. Which makes it even odder that the Canadian versions of the books are identical to the British ones: our spelling might be an unholy mixture of the two, but our vocabulary is nearly identical to American English.

(And honestly, nobody even bats an eye here about American vs British spelling - we just go 'sure, you can write it that way' and carry on.)

***** That... is weird, yeah. Could just be that an American translated it for the Canadian Audience and really took that whole 'The English Queen is still a thing in Canada' thing far more seriously than they ought. :)

That's quite relaxed of you. I know a lot of folks here get really irritated when the American instead of the British spelling is used. You are Canadian, though. You're all far too nice to be grammar nazis. :D

I have to admit, regardless of certain reticent elements of the population, we're getting far more American here as well - with our lit fams and our asses instead of arses and such. Hollywood is a pervasive thing. Eventually, all our people will be listening to their pop music and buying their blue jeans and Australia will be the true English-speakers in the world. :)

** It depends (and I am the European non-Brit). As a writer I am eager to get any comments I get including but not limited to grammar errors and Britpicking, as reader I don't care that much about Mum/Mom (or “Ginny sitting in the room just in T-shirt and pants” ... Harry had to get eyeful!), because I see at least some effort. However, Harry getting to the second base with Ginny is just wrong. Or everybody having always breakfast of pancakes and drinking coffee all the time. On the third hand, I guess we non-Brits imagine Britain to be too much quaint Victorian Dickensian country, and I guess after the war and with TV it is a way more Americanized than we would be believe (so, yes, Star Wars and Superman references could be perfectly appropriate at least for Muggleborns or Muggle-raised).

** Yes and no. In general, unsolicited advice is going to be met with defensiveness, or rudeness in some cases. Basically, read the room.

- Does the author reply to feedback messages either in the notes for the subsequent chapters, or in the reviews section itself? There's a sign that the author is actively engaging with their audience, and will want to respond to a thing you post.

- Does the author put stuff like “if you don't like this, please move on” in their notes for the story, or a subsequent chapter's author notes? Do you see a lot of “I'm just doing this for fun, in the very limited time I have. Chill out.” Here's a sign that they just want everyone to tell them how great they are. Keep it moving.

- Does the author actually say, “Hey, if you spot any errors, let me know and I'll do my best to fix it,” or do they have a request on their story that they're looking for someone to Brit pick? Ding ding ding ding ding! Here's where you know it'll be not only welcomed, but also an effective use of your time.

Finally, if the author has just now posted, and there is no other context, and this is their first story or something, you can put out feelers. “Hey, I'm enjoying the story, but noticed a couple of spots where Americanisms are taking me out of the story. If you want, I can give this a once over, and Brit pick for you.” First, you acknowledge that the reason you're saying anything at all is because you like the story. Then you're making it about you, and not the author---that is, the Americanisms are taking you out of the fantasy world of the story. Then, you're offering to help do something about it, rather than telling the author they need to magically deduce it on their own.

You'll get some who will be grateful, and others who will pass. Either way, you avoid falling into the “well who fucking asked you” trap.

I love it when people point out things that I could do better... I'm working on becoming a better writer and one of the things I love about fanfiction is the immediate response from readers... but I get it that not everyone who is writing fanfiction wants to hear criticisms.

The thing about speaking American English is that there are a lot of terms that we don't even realize are different... we speak the same language, right? What? Why would you put that in the boot? I don't think it'll fit and besides that doesn't make any sense.

**** Britpicking has to be done very carefully lest it appear to be gatekeeping. I think authors should at least make some effort to have British characters talk and act British, but that can be difficult for people who have never even been to the UK and I don't think it should necessarily prevent them from writing HP fanfics.

** I'd apply the same etiquette as correcting typos, grammatical errors, et cetera:

- If the author asks something along the lines of "if you notice a mistake, feel free to tell me!" then they're obviously welcoming it.
- If the author routinely responds to reviews in their authors' notes and/or says things along the lines of "I've taken your advice and edited such-and-such", bring it up in a friendly way just for safety's sake - the author wants to engage and build up a community.
- If in doubt, ask nicely - "Hey, I like your story but I noticed this-and-this taking me out of it - would you like me to go over your story so you can improve it?". Preferably say stuff like this in private, if you have a way to direct-message them.
- Messages like "if you don't like, don't review", or "I'm just doing this for fun, chill out" mean your energy is best wasted elsewhere.
- If the author has a Discord, 9 times out of 10 said Discord will have an editorial channel for this exact purpose.

I try to check things, and joined some writing groups to help me. A writer will ask about a word, and the various brits in the group will argue about whether that word's British or not. Some will say it sounds very American, while others will say that in their part of Britain, they use it all the time. Don't be overconfident in your corrections.

** As with all criticism, I don't think it matters whether it is welcomed or not by the creator of the criticised work. EA Games doesn't get to tell video game reviewers that they can only say positive things about EA's games; fanfic writers don't get to tell fanfic reviewers that they can't criticise their works.

Sure, fanfic is free whereas you (generally) pay for video games, but I don't think that's a relevant distinguishing feature except where criticism relates to "value for money" - most criticism relates to content, not monetary value.

If canon held references to people addressing the other professors as "Charms Master Flitwick" or "Transfiguration Mistress McGonagall," I think I'd have seen at least one such reference in fanfiction by now. Apart from Snape, the only times I can recall someone being addressed as "Master" in a fanfiction, it was as part of an apprenticeship arrangement, and "Master" was not paired with a subject of study.

I have seen a lot of references to people achieving a mastery in charms, potions, or other subject, as though it indicates a particular level of accomplishment. I haven't claimed that anyone who says "Master" refers to a teacher is wrong, I just pointed out an inconsistency in usage.

This. I'm not even British, but reading Roald Dahl as a kid was enough for me to realize that. I'll put up with it if the fic is good, but it gets on my nerves, as do a lot of other blatant Americanisms.

Personally I'd be appreciative if someone britpicked my fic. I did my best, but I'm sure my fic is laden with accidental Americanisms. I don't speak for others, though. Some might take it as a personally attack on their writing abilities, so it's hard to say.

But I do think everyone benefits from some research. I've read some fics where they miss the mark quite a bit on the British terminology and Asian culture. But I've never mentioned this to the authors.

** I dislike most unsolicited criticism (complaints about characterization, plot, trope choice, etc.) I'm the sort of writer who'll suggest in my author's note that you should move on if you don't like my story. Then I'll block you if you continue to hate-read.

That said, I love Britpicking and will always make the correction right away. I consider it, like catching a typo, that rarest of things-- criticism that's actually constructive! There's an objective standard; either I'm right about saying jumper instead of sweater or I'm wrong, as opposed to "Character X would never do ABC," which is more subjective. And when you tell me the correct word, you've offered a solution, which less constructive criticism does not.

**** Agreed that most people don't leave a complaint and then hate-read, but the one in a thousand who do are quite memorable. This is not me randomly attributing a motive to reviewers by the way. If a reviewer leaves 10 reviews on 10 chapters, each starting with "this is why I hate this fic..." I pretty much know what the reviewer is doing.

My issue with more normal complaints is that "better" is often completely subjective. One person tells me my fic would be better if only there were more romance; another person tells me to get rid of the romance entirely. One person tells me my fic would be better if characters were more appreciative of the hard choices Dumbledore made to defeat Voldemort; another person tells me my fic would be better if those same characters took revenge on Dumbledore for the choices he made to defeat Voldemort. All the complaining gets exhausting. I don't ban readers or tell them off for it, though.

** I honestly don't know why anyone cares. I and many others write stories for fun, and weird british phrasings aren't really all that important. I don't live in britain, I don't really engage with brits all that often. It's an unfortunate coincidence that the book is set in britain.

That said, a lot of brits have an unhealthy amount of patriotism or an obsession with their weird culture (I don't even like the culture of my own country, germany) which really turns me off reviews. It just isn't important or interesting, and I don't care what phrases or words you deem acceptable because in the end I'm the writer, and I do it because I want to, not to satisfy the literary purity of some islander. If you want briticisms, then write your own story, but don't flood my reviews with

"Um ackshually that's not called pot it's a kettle, that's crisps and not chips, that's chips and not fries, that's..."

"Excuuuse me, that's not a mastery, that's called a diploma, and also you made a bunch of typos, it's called "colour" and "armour", you fucking yank"

"The story is basically jesus' second coming, but you called that stone brick a brick and not a bricky-dicky like they did in 1876 and bla bla bla so now I'm dropping this story hope you die in a fire"

Because I don't care.

I've gotten enough of these comments over the years.

*** I just find it really, really irritating and I think it's a mark of bad, lazy writing. If you can't be respectful to another culture, don't write stories set in that culture. Britain has a different culture to America and it's annoying to constantly have American culture transplanted over here. I know you're German, but Americans are the worst offenders.

If you were writing a fic set in Japan, say, you would do the basics of research to make sure that you won't make any embarrassing mistakes. It's the same thing. The fact that you're the writer doesn't absolve you of criticism when you get stuff wrong.

** Not particularly helpful imo. I don't see why authors can't throw a few americanisms in especially when most fanfics cause much bigger and more significant changes to canon. When so many fics have a female Harry Potter or a good-hearted Draco Malfoy, I couldn't care less about whether the author is referring to a season as Autumn or Fall.

Most of the time, authors don't even realize they aren't sticking to British words. It doesn't bother me personally, grammar is what I look at.

I don't mind any criticism so if someone did tell me to change my stuff, I wouldn't be offended. On the flip side, I've received a couple of compliments for avoiding americanisms in my current story and I didn't care for them either.

*** I really don't think deliberate character changes like fem!Harry or good!Draco are an apt basis to relate Americanisms to.

An Americanism in a Harry Potter fic is like a typo - unintentional, /factually wrong/ (it's superimposing American speech patterns and/or culture onto a different real-life country), and usually entirely unrelated to the plot (unless the plot revolves around a Muggle uprising and the story full-on assumes the First Amendment of the US Constitution to be in place in Britain).

I see Britpicking as being on the same level as correcting typos, for that reason. Same etiquette applies - test the waters first, see if the author welcomes your offer (or that of others who offered the same thing). If an author gets defensive, back away - not worth it.

*** Yeah, I think it quite a personal problem, even most british people don't care as much as I do! Even more than explicit canon changes, it completely takes me out of the story. I think it's because I can envisage a universe where Malfoy eventually grows up, I can't envisage a universe where Harry talks about looking forward to "fall"

**** I mentioned it in a comment a few weeks ago (a thread about fanfic bugbears) and quite a few agreed - it is jarring because they are British characters who would never say "fall", "mom" etc. In a book with American characters it would be fine as it would be in character, it's not about what we're used to per se, but the mischaracterisation.

**** Also British, and I find Americanisms one of the worst things for pulling me out of a story. It's even more jarring if the fic is otherwise really well written and probably why it's so frustrating.

I wouldn't care if it was an American-based fandom and American characters, but I'd bet I'd be picked up on for using Britishisms in that instance too, so I do think it's fair.

** I see this happening every once in a while on our subreddit here. In all honesty, I find it irritating every single time.

Look, if you write an actual book set in UK, then you should obviously do as much research as you can to create an immersive atmosphere. But for a fic that mostly takes place in a de facto foreign nation anyway (Magical Britain)? Please, just stop. Absolutely nobody cares what kind of slang term was used in a specific part of London in the 90s. Or that it's mom instead of mum. Or kiss instead of snog. Or subway instead of tube.

I can understand when it's something really major, about different laws and such. But freaking different words, or some pop culture reference? Bruh, you're just being cringe stop.

**** I think a useful comparison is to imagine that it wasn't American but rather Italian or Turkish or Chinese words and cultural references entering the narrative. Would that be a problem? I think almost everyone would say yes - these cultural references would be clearly out of place in a story set in Britain. An indeed there was a period of time where a lot of Japanese influences entered HP fanfic and Harry would go around saying shit like "Snape-san". It was almost universally decried.

The only reason why /American/ cultural influences are given a break is the reach of American cultural and linguistic imperialism. But in principle there's no difference between "Snape-san" and the Dursleys eating pancakes for breakfast.
