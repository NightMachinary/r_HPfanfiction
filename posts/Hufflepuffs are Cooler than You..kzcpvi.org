Everyone makes fun of Hufflepuffs because they're all about /loyalty/ and /hard work/. The thing is, there's one other place you can find those values front and center. The military.

Essentially, Hufflepuff is Basic Training. Hufflepuffs are in charge of taking care of their own dormitories and are punished severely in house for failing to complete their work properly. Everyone makes fun of them, but they turn out the most Aurors of all the houses due to the PT sessions that they do daily and combat training. Once they get to the upper years, their training becomes more serious.


** Fair point, but military does not automatically equal cool.

I thought it was a discussion on the houses.

** That actually would fit well with the dichotomy you see between Gryffindor and Hufflepuff sometimes in fics.

Gryffindors are warriors. They can fight well. Hufflepuff are soldiers. They fight well TOGETHER and are disciplined.

**** I don't want to say it like this, as I'm really not fond of the 'hrrdrr, Gryffindors are idiots' thing you see in a lot of anti-Gryffindor fics.

I'd say more that, to use Percy Jackson terms, Gryffindors are Greeks and Hufflepuffs Romans. ;)

***** The Gryffindors are the crazy badasses, it's just the Hufflepuffs are good at war.

If you need a suicide mission completed more comparable to a movie plot than an actual fight, send a single Gryffindor. They'll come back after having killed that eldritch abomination. Gryffindors are the Richard O'Connells of the group.

Hufflepuffs are the Band of Brothers.

***** I prefer to see Gryffindors as Aragorns from LotR, lonely rangers/super-warriors.

***** No no no no. Wizards don't have tactics. They stand around in broad view, and don't cover their backs. Hufflepuffs know better
