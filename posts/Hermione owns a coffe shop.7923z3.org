So i get to the last chapter of the story and my app crashes, loosing the fic, and now I can't find it.

Its a H/Hr, Hermione runs away after the Battle of Hogwarts and eventually opens a bakery/coffe shop/cafe type place. 10 years later Harry walks in.

I think it was something like Broken Mirror or Cracked Mirror, but google is being less than helpful. Perhaps one of you lovlies would be better? Please and thank you.


** Check out [[/r/HPharmony]]. Someone asked for the same fic there. It's *A Crack in the Glass, Shatters the Past* by CelticPagan-3. linkffn(7509302)

  After the final battle Hermione turns away from the wizarding world, why? After years hiding in the muggle world Harry tracks her down and tries to convince her to return, will he succeed? H/Hr pairing, EWE, drama, romance & a little bit of fluff.
