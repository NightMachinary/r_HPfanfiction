I'm looking for /harry potter/ *naruto* crossovers. Good ones. Doesn't matter if Harry is Jashin, after becoming MoD. Or he is the shinigami sealing kurama in naruto.


** One I just recently discovered is /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11634921/1/Itachi-Is-That-A-Baby][Itachi, Is That A Baby?]]/, which is still young but looks promising. It's a crack-fic with a super-powered, +borderline+ sociopathic Harry, but it's mainly about other characters' reactions to his actions rather than him curb-stomping everything. Snape is especially enjoyable.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.
