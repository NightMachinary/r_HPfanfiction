Idea here is that I write a 10K chapter every week on topics that the community picks based on this thread. I'll do the story in the style of a crime drama, or Doctor Who/ Stargate where each 'episode' is a different murder/magical mystery that Harry and his as yet undisclosed (Read I haven't figured out who yet) Auror partner would have to solve. There will be an overarching plot that I'll weave into it but the majority of the chapters would be inspired by community suggestions.


** I am 100% down with this. Double bonus points if you call it /Law and Auror/.

** OOO more serious or more whimsical? I like the idea of a HP crime drama from the range of Castle-ish to Broadchurch-ish.

** I would absolutely read this! 10k a week is a /lot/ though, and it would be cool if it could have both monster-of-the-week stuff and monster-of-the-week resolving into a larger plot arc, you know?

** I'm sort of iffy on a "community input" part, can lead to too predictable stuff (because it was based on what someone proposed) and delays (because you have to wait on feedback). But the idea itself of having more episodic post-war HP story is solid.

*** Delays can be mitigated by OP collecting a batch of ideas at once but I do think community ideas wouldn't add much to an already decent idea.

** OH. MY. GOD. YES.

I mean... that would be lovely. Thanks for offering to do this.

I've actually been dying for a good auror-fic with Harry as the main character. You can bet your bottom dollar I would contribute and read it eagerly!

** Yes. Though try to have some overarching arcs, those things tend to become anoying when they don't really seem to go anywhere.

This fandom doesn't have nearly enough crime and mystery.
