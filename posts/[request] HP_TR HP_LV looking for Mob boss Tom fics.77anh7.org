I am looking for some fics where Tom or Voldemort is a mob boss, head of the mafia or similar. I have read Aware and a couple of others, but I am loving this theme. I would prefer it to be HP/TR or HP/LV too please


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/754716][The Dancer series]] by Earth_Phoenix is a non-magic AU in which Tom is a mob boss. 1st story is finished. 2nd hasn't been updated since early August.

**** Ah, well that's all I've come across for that particular take on that pairing. You should try asking in [[/r/HPSlashFic]] if you don't get many recs here. I've gotten a bunch of HP/TMR and HP/LV recs when I've asked there.
