I just found this recently and found it really nice. It's Daphne helping Harry dealing with his Dark Lord problem during 6th year.

Happy holidays all.

** Seconded.

The story is really great and the author is staying away from overused tropes or bashing. It is honestly very refreshing to read.

** just read it, very nice. Not finished yet but updated as recently as a few hours ago. Very natural dialogue, believable characterization and not OOC.

** Not a huge fan. The opening commits one of the Deadly Sins of fanfiction, that of elevating a side character/OC into someone more important than the protagonists we are familiar with. Also known as "American transfer student holds the key to defeating Voldemort" syndrome.

In the space of a few short paragraphs, the reader is /told/ that this is a character to rival Hermione Granger in capabilities (and, by implication, leave Harry in the dust). We're also told she was instrumental to Voldemort's defeat. So in the space of a few paragraphs a character has gone from being no one to being more important than two of the most consequential characters in the series.

She hasn't earned that status, it's simply declared to the reader. And that naturally leads to the reader disliking her. It is this which is at the core of the dislike towards Mary Sues.

*** Ignore the first chapter, it is much much worse than the rest of the story which is interesting and unusual in its approach to Slytherin/Gryffindor dating and other stuff.

** I also just found this story from a recommendation from another fic. I really like it because I think it characterizes Daphne very well. I like stories written from a non-Harry perspective when done well.
