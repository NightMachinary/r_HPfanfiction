Summary:

Hermione's mother Helen Wasn't always a Granger .Her maiden name happened to be Winchester. That's enough to explain why Hermione's parents never freaked out and pulled her out of school. They expected Apocalyptic levels of crazy to follow their kid around. It's a family tradition after all.


** Thank you for taking my suggestion and reposting with a summary. However, it seems odd that you would repost and not edit your title. After all, you could have directly edited your post with the summary.

As always, I will provide an edit to your post that I suggest you copy over (if you don't want to repost, you can just copy over the edited summary). And my offer to edit your posts for you remains standing. Feel free to PM me.

*** Okay, thank you for trying to help but there is nothing wrong with my post. The title is intentionally lower case because that is the title of my fic. I am on mobile and quite frankly it rather rude of you to hound people like this.. If you dont like something that is fine but you don't need to be insulting about it. The title of the work is lower case for a reason. Its a crack fic, a summary is included in my original post.

**** I apologize if it comes over rude, but I do consider it a common courtesy to edit a repost. I have edited my proposed edits to reflect your fic's title. Your summary still contains a few major errors that I have corrected and I suggest that you copy it over. Using a phone does not preclude you from editing.

There was no summary in the original post. [[https://www.removeddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/iq9ucj/the_family_business_has_been_updated_chapter_9_is/]]
