Basically as the title says I'm looking for suggestions to well written Crossovers with Fairy Tail. Preferably Harry centric. I did try and look and it seemed a lot of it was slash (which is fine but not my preference). There doesn't need to be a pairing but it would be nice to see Harry with a girl from the Fairy Tail universe instead of from HP universe. Anyway, let me know. Thanks.
