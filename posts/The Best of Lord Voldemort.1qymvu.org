This is a list of stories that feature Lord Voldemort/Tom Riddle as an actual or central character without being a crazy cartoon villain or submitting to any whitewashing. I'm always looking for more, so please feel free to contribute. AUs are fine, but stories where Lord Voldemort becomes a good guy and abandons his wicked ways through the power of love, sex or romance (slash or otherwise) are not acceptable.
