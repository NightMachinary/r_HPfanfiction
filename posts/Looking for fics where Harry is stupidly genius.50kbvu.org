Looking for a fic where Harry has a brother/sister that is the Boy/Girl who lived, making people underestimate Harry, while he is actually a genius that can obliterate them all.

I know there probably isnt much that meet these requirements, but whatever.

I'll also accept fics where Harry is just a genius without the boy/girl who lived stuff.

70k+ words.


** closest I know of is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived)

Harry's brother is the boy who lived and they get along great, but Harry is much more studious and makes some large changes when everyone keeps underestimating him at Hogwarts. Probably not exactly what you're looking for and it's more of an over-powered 'darkish' Harry after the first act but it fits your basic description.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** linkffn(In The Mind of a Scientist by Zenonokyuubi) The first two of the series are amusing to me. The first is all Hogwarts, the second is Stargate SG1, and the third is Mass Effect.

No twin/sibling crap though.

linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches by LordVonE) This one does have twin and Time-Travel stuff, and a harem. It's a recent, currently updating (new chapter today!) fic that is only just through first year and will probably go to at least fourth year.

  Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches
#+end_quote

When I first read that title i just closed my browser and moved on but this fic is surprisingly decent. It's obviously still full of cliches and Harry is overpowered as fuck but the writing is pretty good and while it's not something that I take too seriously it's a fun read overall.

  If Harry's baby brother, Daniel, is the Boy-Who-lived, then what of Harry? What is his role? Is he destined for greater? Or, is he to play a much bigger role in the future? Follow Canon's plot, with much bigger AU's plot as the story progresses.

***** Like you, I don't don't really like Harry/Fleur story. This story has aspects what the OP asked. Also to say Harry is 3 years older than canon in this story.

Some things in the story is good indeed. But Harry/Fleur is just silly as of the most stories. Fortunately it's not a major focus of the story.
