What if somewhere in the 3rd year - or more interesting (since Voldemort has already returned at that point in time) - after his encounter in Privet drive at the beginning of his 5th year, Harry gets kissed by a Dementor and the Horcrux takes over his body. And at first not really knowing what to do since years have passed since it had an actual consciousness, the Horcrux impersonates Harry and gets taken to the Order pf the Phoenix who don't know that a certain Dark Lord has infiltrated them.


** It's always seemed quite possible to me that /that/ is the real reason the Dementors always seemed to focus on Harry so much (the "great suffering in his life making him an easy prey" idea in canon is just an educated guess, not a certainty). After all, the Dementors have it pretty swell under Voldemort, and much less so under the Ministry.

*** I like the idea that the screaming Harry hears isn't /his/ worst memory, but Voldemort's.

** Well if Harrymort joins with the original Voldemort, it's pretty much curtains for the Order. Maybe if Harrymort decides that the original Voldemort isn't all that and decides to oppose him too, kinda like what diarymort did in [[/u/Slightly_Too_Heavy][u/Slightly_Too_Heavy]]'s fantastic work The Imposter Complex linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13275002/1/]]) then there would be a chance for the Order to make progress by pitting the two Dark Lords against each other.

That said, it could be an interesting horror/mystery if the readers are only given the perspective of the Order members and the readers are unaware of Harry being Harrymort for a long while.

*** Imagine poor Ron and Hermione...

He has to be in there somewhere, they try to think. Harry still has to be fighting, he still has to exist... But what can you do when the monster wears the face of your best friend?

**** Cool, thanks. I'm a very new writer so it is going to +suck ass+ be quite poorly written, but I'll be sure to link it.
