:END:
Hey all,

I'm trying to find a fanfic that I read a little while ago, I think it was AO3, but I'm not sure. Severus is given by voldemort to Harry Potter as a messenger. Severus ask Draco to help him in getting Potter to agree so that there are no side effects. He doesn't want fumbling his way through the acceptance. When Potter accepts Severus as a messenger/servant there is a download of memories on each side (I think) and Severus declares that Harry is never going back to his relatives ever. Draco gets in contact with his parents and I can't remember what happens next...

I don't think it was complete, but I can't remember.


** OMG, I saved that as a bit of pureblood culture that I liked ( "I need you to walk Potter through the ritual to receive a messenger and acceptance of a message from an enemy house with gift.")

So, because of my "data packrat" tendencies, I can tell you that this is Family Contract by Genuka. linkao3(12713307)

  What if Voldemort discovered that there was a marriage contract between him and the Potters? What if Dumbledore was trying to nullify it in favor of a new contract between Harry and Ginny? What if he decided that the contract was strange for even existing and potentially valid? What lengths do you think he would go to to know the truth?~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~http://archiveofourown.org/works/9694889/chapters/28724588Adopted prompt from Elvirakitties, Plot Bunnies Ch 57Prompt in opening notes.

*** Thanks so much, I had a feeling it was by Genuka, but I just couldn't pick it out from the list.
