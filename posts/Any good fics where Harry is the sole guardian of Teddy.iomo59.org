I just read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14403330/chapters/33262935][Chained]] and I thought Harry and Teddy's relationship was really cute. So, any non-canon compliant fics where Harry doesn't have kids of his own and Andromeda isn't Teddy's guardian? I'd like if there weren't pairings but I'm fine with anything as long as it isn't the main focus.


** I love chained! I think JacobApples fic called Disorder of the Phoenix linkffn(13668247) has a good Harry and Teddy bond, but Andromeda coparents. Also, it's nowhere near as good as chained. The quailty of writing is worse.

Jenorama has some great stories where Harry and Ginny raise Teddy, though it's mostly Ginny POV, but her Ginny is super fun. Here's one I found that's a Teddy and Harry fic and it's pretty good linkao3(12132915)

  It's Teddy's senior year and his ideas about his future clash with Harry's ideas for him. A visit from a past acquaintance complicates matters.

**** There's also a fic where Harry and Teddy time travel to Harry's third year to root out a future Dark Lord, and Teddy gets to know Remus better. It's also not as well written as Chained but it has some fun moments too if you're interested linkffn(7073162)

  Darkness is about to rise, but they aren't ready to fight. A plan was set into place; to stop it from ever rising in the first place. Harry & Teddy must time travel to 1993. They must find the boy who would grow up to become the new Dark Lord, without getting tangled in the whole Sirius Black issue. Would they be able to keep their identities secret from everyone?
