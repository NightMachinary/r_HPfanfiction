And by smart I don't mean 11-year-old Harry acting like an adult, politician, manipulator, and magic god that puts everyone to shame with his awesomness kind of smart.

I'm talking about being him being more reserved and maybe cynical due to his time with the Dursleys, and definitely more interested in magic rather than getting into trouble every chance he gets.

** How about a 4 part series? The first is: Harry Potter in the Claw of the Raven

If you can work past the Merry Meet / Merry Part thing 700 million times, it is enjoyable.
