I just read Betrayed by kateydidnt and really enjoyed the premise of it and I want more now. Doesnt necessarily have to be Harry leaves wizarding world like Betrayed though.

And I have read Grow Young With Me. Several times


** Just dropping in to say sorry for the long wait between chapters...Hopefully I'll get you some new reading material soon ;)

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

  HPxOC. Runs along with the original storyline. Adele Polkiss is the younger sister of Piers Polkiss, a close friend of Dudley Dursley. This way she meets Harry Potter, a curious boy with a mysterious past, and a wonderful secret... Magic! COMPLETE

** I'm not a fan of /Behind Blue Eyes/, but it does prominently feature a muggle girl as partner for Harry. I thought it was a fic that actually had something almost like an original idea, and I liked that the girl was definitely not idealized, but Harry did a lot of seriously stupid stuff I couldn't get past, and I thought the girl's messed up life was just /too/ messed up to play like the author wanted it to. (I think there were other issues as well, but it's been several years since I read it.).\\
Not a Harry leaves the wizarding world so much as a "Harry gets pissed and runs away with a girl" story.\\

*** I suppose it's all opinions, but I enjoyed the way that the characters in behind blue eyes did make mistakes, and had seriously messed up lives. It reminded me of the series 'skins'. Seriously angsty, emotional and cute story.

Sorry, really felt the need to defend this one a bit

**** No, I totally get that. I don't know, perhaps it was how I was when I read it, but I felt like their mistakes just kept compounding for more and more drama, rather than because all the mistakes made sense. I do see the resemblance to skins. I think this one might be the sort to either rub you a bit the wrong way or to hit you in just the right way.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.
