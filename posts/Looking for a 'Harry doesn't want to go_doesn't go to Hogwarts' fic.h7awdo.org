:END:
Harry got into a private school but he still had to return to the Dursley house at the end of the day. He didn't want to attend Hogwarts, as it was not in his plan, told McGonagall that, and someone (Dumbledore, probably) memory-charmed the school's Headmaster, to tell Harry he couldn't stay. Petunia was manipulated as well. The last chapter ended with Harry convincing the Headmaster to keep him on the roll, but he'd send his homework in through a messenger service.


** Found it!

** I thought I knew this one, but this story has only half of what you asked for. Harry studies hard to get into an exclusive secondary school, and Dumbledore goes behind his back and memory charms the Headmaster with a transfer to "Hogwarts School for the Gifted." Harry is much than amused. Maybe it can tide you over until somebody finds the story you asked for.
