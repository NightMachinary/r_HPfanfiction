*** Well, I'm mostly interested in exploring her psyche when she herself thinks she's going to die. I don't really care about her actually dying or not, but some kind of deus ex machina that saves her would make the whole thing feel cheap. So I think she has to die. Or the story can end before that moment and leave it ambiguous.

Something like the end of Tale of Two Cities would be good.

** If you can find At Sunrise (it's no longer on FFN), it has Hermione with a terminal illness.

  James Potter would never forget the first time he met Hermione Granger. Nor would he forget just how much he owed her for all she had done for him, his family, his world, and his future. HHr, through the evolving eyes of James Potter. HHr/JPLE
