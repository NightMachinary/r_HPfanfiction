** Professor sinistra?? I'm not sure if she has been sorted, but I think it might be Ravenclaw?

*** [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Professor#Hogwarts]]

I have seen her to be both Slytherin and Gryffindor (but many people, me included, have tendency confuse her with Septima Vector, who is in the same situation). If you think she was Ravenclaw, we have three fourths covered.

The same goes for Professor Burbage, we don't know what house she was, most likely not Slytherin (improbable house for the Professor of Muggle Studies).

We actually don't know what house Dolores Umbridge was. Making her Slytherin only because she was nasty, is not a good enough proof.

We also don't know anything about the house of Professor Binns, while he was still alive.

We don't know anything about the houses of Professors Hooch or Vector.

**** It says on Pottermore that Umbridge was a Slytherin.

***** Which could very well be one of those retcons one could choose to ignore.

I have actually seen her somewhere to be in Hufflepuff, and it was refreshing. In the same manner as the world needs non-evil Slytherins to be in the balance, it needs evil Hufflepuffs.
