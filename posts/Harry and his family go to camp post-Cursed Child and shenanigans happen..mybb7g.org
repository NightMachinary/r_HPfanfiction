:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Here's what I remember:

-It had Scorpius and Scorbus.

-I'm pretty sure James was dating Seamus and Dean's daughter (who I think was named Nora?)

-The Granger-Weasley's were also there with the rest of the Weasley family.

-They placed a bet on something (I think it was how long until Albus and Scorpius got together).

-The kids tried to become Animagi because of Teddy's shapeshifting, it backfires and they get severely reprimanded.

-It was at least 25,000 words.

-It was on Ao3.

-There was a sequel over 100,000 words about the next year at Hogwarts.

Any help is appreciated!
