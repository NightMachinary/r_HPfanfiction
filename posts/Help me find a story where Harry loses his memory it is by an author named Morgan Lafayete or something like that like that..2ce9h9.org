This particular story was one of the first fanfictions that I read, like 10 years ago or so and was totally in love with it. The story takes place after Hogwarts, Harry marries Ginny and they have a child together but somewhere along the fight against Voldemort Harry looses his memory and is nowhere to be found. A couple of years past by and Harry is found living, i think, among muggles, and the Weasley's bring him back, he and ginny come together again and try and find out what happened to him.

One of the last chapters is about them having sex and how he didn't mind the stretch marks and afterwards he covered them both with a blanket just like he used to. I believe the chapter has the words, chocolate, frog, and/or green eyes. I don't know why this particular scene has stuck with me after all these years but hopefully it helps.

Its an incomplete fiction but is really well written and a good story. The author's name is something like MorganLafayette or MorganaLafayete or something along those lines. I have tried google to no avail maybe somebody here remembers it or was able to save it from her livejournal or siye account.

Please help me if you can. I would very much appreciate it.
