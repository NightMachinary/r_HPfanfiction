** I recently read a harry potter being Moriarty Expy on wizarding world one shot but can't find it in my browser history. He opens the wizarding world's first brothel, first casino, and the first organized crime operation with him at the top. Also, there is no Sherlock equivalent to stop him. It finishes at the ending of the triwizard tournament.

*** I've read that one. It's pretty good. But I was thinking more along the lines of Doctor Doom or Doctor Loveless style villainy.

Doesn't all of that already apply to Voldemort? Costume? Check! Supervillain name+Amusing theme? Check!

How are traditional comic book supervillains not also terrorists?

***** It depends but would you really consider [[https://imgur.com/a/2keVU]] a terrorist?and yeah. Doc ock is a terrorist incontemporary era comics but in the old days, not so much.

Voldemort is a terrorist as he uses his crimes to advance a political agenda whereas most Villains in comics are about the money.

****** A lot of what the Joker does seems to fall perfectly under the umbrella of terrorism, in particular when he tries to spread anarchy. But there are many different renditions of that character and it probably doesn't apply to all.

In any case, most of the Dark Lord Harry stories I've seen only lack the "silly name" to fall under the supervillain umbrella. But that's probably because I don't see your distinction. Super-villain = A villain with some kind of super powers. Any Dark Lord is a supervillain by default.
