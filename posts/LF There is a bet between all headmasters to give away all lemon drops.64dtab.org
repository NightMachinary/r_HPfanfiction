I remember this story as being a bit of a laugh, and fancy rereading it in my hungover Sunday state... can anyone help?

All headmaster have a standing bet to give away all the lemon drops, but there are punishments involving the lemon drops multiplying if one tries to cheat? I can't remember many other specifics though.. sorry :(


** There's a story, History of the lemon drop, or something, in which each successive headmaster strives to outdo the other wrt to the potency and creativity of the drug they can lace the lemon drop with.

Riddle happened due to a particularly badly produced drug by Dippet, as evidenced by the fact that he was obviously high as fuck when he decided to make an anagram of his name for use as a dark lord.

**** Don't forget all of them are also likely victims of the same thing. In fact Dumbledore samples his own wares.

** I remember it. The drops multiplied whenever someone tried to vanish them. They solved it by compacting large numbers of drops into big blocks which they then fed to Grawp. I have no idea which fic it is.
