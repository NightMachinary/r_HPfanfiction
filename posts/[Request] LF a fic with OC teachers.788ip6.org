I want to read a fanfiction that has a professor who is an original character, or explores a subject that isn't mentioned in the novels (eg: Harry learning stuff about ritual magic, soul magic). I really like fics that expands upon the magical system and goes into detail about magical theories too.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125300][Black Luminary]] - Non-BWL (at least it seems so) Harry adopted by Blacks in the world where some of the old pureblood families (Bones, Prewetts, etc.) made a power move after Grindelwald's defeat to get other old pureblood families (Blacks, Lestranges, Malfoys, etc.) out of the politics using protecting muggleborns' and half-bloods' rights as an excuse. Strong wordbuilding, slow pacing. Just finished the first year.

New Defence teacher.

 

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12417372][Old Blood]] - Harry Potter mixed with Arthurian legends. Pretty interesting so far, especially in terms of Harry's relationship with (female) Quirrel. Updated recently after short hiatus.

The female Quirrel is an entirely new character with different first name, character and background.

 

[[http://tinyurl.com/jkc2qeu][Alexandra Potter]] - The first year of Girl-Who-Lived in a more magical Hogwarts. It focuses on school life and author's variation on magic system. Only the first year is complete, but it stands on its own and theoretically, there is a new version planned. With theoretically being the key word here.

A few new teachers, because Hogwarts is bigger.

 

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725][Forging the Sword]] - "For a want of a nail" type fic that diverges from the end of CoS. Great take on the magic system, that's creative and stays close to canon at the same time. Rather slow paced, with the whole third year being focused mostly on the character- and worldbuilding. Sadly died just when plot was started getting really interesting. Though considering author's earlier hiatuses I still have hope for more updates. In this case the change is in mechanics of the diary - killing Tom would also kill Ginny. But not killing Tom would also mean that Ginny will die. And so Harry is forced to do a hard thing and kill his friend's sister. And things spiral out of there.

New Defence teacher.

*** +1 for Black Luminary. One pf my favorites at the moment. The update rate has slowed down a little and the larger plot is still very much a mystery but i enjoy it a lot.

  8/24/16-STORY UNDER CONSTRUCTION. REWRITTEN CHAPTERS SOON- Professor Snape makes an unlikely friend in spite of himself, or maybe because of Albus. She may be a Muggle, but he slowly realizes what an amazing Muggle she is. It's such a shame that people need to think of Severus Snape as the greasy, grumpy, bat of the dungeons. (Orig story/Snape's POV/OC worked in w/o changing canon)

  In J.K. Rowling's first draft it wasn't Hagrid that found Harry Potter in Godric's Hollow, but a lowly dentist named Granger. What if he had? Harry Potter is brought before the muggle authorities, an apparent orphan. With Daniel Granger named the child's temporary guardian, he disappears into the muggle world. LittleBro!Harry, BigSis!Hermione. Not a HP/HG Ship. Canon Pairings.
