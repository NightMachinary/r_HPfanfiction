I would like to preface this by stating that the fic that I'm looking for is probably not a very "good" fic, lol. But it was one of the first FanFics I read, and I remember thinking the concept was interesting, and now that I've got a few (ha few ha) more Fics under my belt, I'd kind of like to see how it stand up, I guess.

Anyways, the only part I remember clearly is the very end. In the fic, Dumbledore is evil, like Dark Lord evil. Tom Riddle is actually a good guy that Dumbledore is using as a scapegoat or something. Riddle was married, and his wife had supposedly been killed. (I think Riddle may have been Harry's father or grandfather, but that bit's fuzzy). Anyways, there's a battle at Hogwarts, Harry is on Riddle's side, Dumbledore is going completely crazy, and ends up summoning Riddle's wife, who wasn't dead, just a prisoner. That's the part I specifically remember.

Ok, I'm literally laughing at myself right now, because if I saw a Fic summary like what I just described, I would almost definitely skip it. But call me sentimental. Anyone every read it? Oh, It was definitely complete, and probably longer than 30k, since I didn't read a lot of shorter Fics when I started.


** I am also looking for this story. I loved it and I'm dying to read it again. It was around 80-100k IIRC, though I may not be remembering correctly.

Severus/Bellatrix was also a pairing in the story.

  Harry walks the halls of Hogwarts seriously injured and is confronted by the Slytherins. They take him to Snape, who uses Legilimency to make a startling discovery. Is Dumbledore really who he says he is? Is Harry really on the right side of the war? Goodish!Voldemort, No Slash, Powerful Harry, Mentor Snape, Good Malfoys, super bad Dumbles, very abused Harry, AU Goblet of Fire
