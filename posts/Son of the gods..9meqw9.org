Looking for long decent fics involving Harry as the child of one of the gods, doesn't need to be just the Olympian gods as I'm sure there have been others. Have been very into these fics and would like to read more of them.

Thanks.

  Harry was born cursed, but didn't know until he fell through a portal to another world. There people have wings and hate him for his curse, but it gives him power: power to change this new world as well as his own. AU after 5th year.

*** I saw it mentioned quite a few time but never tried because the idea of James being Thor seemed too far fetched to me. Unfortunately I'm coming to the end of my "to read" list so I'll have to try some I first discarded.

**** I can definitely understand how it's not everyone's cup of tea, but it's also not awful. The sheer number of additional characters to keep track of can be a bit overwhelming, especially if you don't actually know about them already.

The biggest "criticism" I have is that it reads more like a Marvel fic that incorporates Harry Potter and a few other fandoms, as opposed to a Harry Potter fic that incorporates Marvel and the rest. Which is actually a matter of taste, hence the quotes around "criticism." I also remember feeling like the crossover cast was overtaking the Harry Potter cast in terms of both screen time and importance, but that might just be due to all the extra names I had to remember.

**** It is good, it has really good world building and the sequel is being in the works. It draws from both the marvel and the Harry Potter universes and combines them in a unique and interesting way.

It has Carol Danvers, Jean-Paul, and a few other comic characters as good secondary characters and it builds in a way such that Lucius Malfoy takes over Hydra in a believable way.

  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.

  In his several millennia of existence Loki Odinson, God of Mischief and Lies, had been many things; he had been a liar, a warrior, and a trickster, just to name a few, but never before had he been a loving father, he'd never been given the chance. However, the moment the tiny creature was in his arms, he knew he would do anything necessary to keep hold of what was his.

  When Lily and James Potter asked a goddess to grant them a child, they had no idea that their simple wish would have so many consequences, especially when that child is raised by a legendary witch long thought dead.

** Avengers crossovers have a common trope where for one reason or another Harry is Loki or Thor's child. On AO3 there is a tag for the Loki fic. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Btitle%5D=&work_search%5Bcreators%5D=&work_search%5Brevised_at%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=&work_search%5Bcrossover%5D=&work_search%5Bsingle_chapter%5D=0&work_search%5Bword_count%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&work_search%5Bfandom_names%5D=&work_search%5Brating_ids%5D=&work_search%5Bcharacter_names%5D=&work_search%5Brelationship_names%5D=&work_search%5Bfreeform_names%5D=Harry+Potter+is+Loki+%28Marvel%29%27s+Child&work_search%5Bhits%5D=&work_search%5Bkudos_count%5D=&work_search%5Bcomments_count%5D=&work_search%5Bbookmarks_count%5D=&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=_score&work_search%5Bsort_direction%5D=desc&commit=Search][Harry Potter is Loki (Marvel)'s Child]] that you can use to pull a good number of them up.

​

And in my favorite crossover series ever Mischeif's Heir by mad_fairy Harry and another character Tom Riddle are adopted by Loki. So they aren't gods themselves but it is a major element. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/309447]]

​

I am currently writing my own story where a female Harry is Loki's child. Loki isn't a part of it yet as he only shows up when the events of Avengers happens and Harriet is currently in 5th year but Harriet is the Goddess of Fates and has powers which she comes into over time. It is going to be long story and explores elements of magic and Harriet's powers/heritage as a witch, a god, and a Jotunn as well. Once Loki and Thor come around Asgard and the gods will have a bigger role.

​

If you have any questions I'd be happy to answer them.

​

I post on a regular schedule of Tuesday/Friday on [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]] and post immediately after finishing a chapter on AO3
