Hey Guys!

I am currently looking for some new fanfictions

One of the things I would really like to see in these fanfics is some exotic magics like in linkffn(The Life he Leads) or linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13438181/1/The-Arcanist-Unspeakable-Mysteries][The *Arcanist*: *Unspeakable* Mysteries]]) or even something like linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12824247/1/Harry-Potter-Lord-of-Darkness][*Harry* *Potter*: *Lord* of *Darkness*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5801151/AngelSlayer135][AngelSlayer135]])

Or another thing that would be nice for a fanfic is if it is not as hogwards centric as is the norm or at least not again all 7 years that just make what happens next too predictable. Examples for this would be fanfics like the arcanist mentioned above or linkffn(Make A Wish by Rorschach's Blot)

Then fic may or may not be a Crossover.

The fic CAN contain NSFW content but shouldnt be just that.

Anything 70k+ words length wise would be appreciated


** Have you read linkffn(Blindness)?

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
