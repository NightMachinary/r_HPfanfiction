*** Oh yeah. Dredd was good, but it felt too..dark, like this was Mega City One the way Dredd would prefer it if he had the choice.

***** Yeah, I suppose. I acutally came up with an idea for a crossover just now. Its where Dredd and Harry(Who is a Brit-Cit Judge in the future, as he is immortal), time travel back to the 1990s, to stop a time-related villian. The wizards of the period, both the Order and the Death Eaters are horrified at what teh world has become in the future. Harry promises to change things when he returns to teh future, while Dredd just gives his usual speech on order.
