I've read/seen a lot of manipulative/evil Dumbledore fics, are there any with manipulative/evil McGonagall? Thanks in advance:-)


** You know, I started writing a bunch of stuff about her canon actions that could be twisted into being perceived as manipulations, but I noticed something: most of them started by saying "she did nothing when..."

So there you have it: we don't have manipulative McGonagall because, most of the time, she just does nothing. She is a lousy head of house (you cannot be an advocate for your house when you have to be impartial as Deputy Head), and the most unlikely thing in canon is Harry losing his shit over one of the Carrows spitting on her.

*** I feel there is one exception. In book 1 when she catches Harry, Hermione and Neville having sent off the dragon. By taking 150 points off (when most points awarded in class were 1 or 2 at a time) the book explicitly described how the three were systematically ostracised by all their housemates, people who they are living and sleeping with, for weeks at least, if not months. Remember, they are 11-12 year olds at boarding school, and she is responsible for their wellbeing as a teacher and head of house. Given she had been head of house and a teacher for years she must have known that would happen. Presumably she also agreed to, if not decided on, sending them out with Hagrid, a man who cannot use magic to defend them, to find something willing and able to kill unicorns.

Given how she does absolutely nothing for Harry for the rest of the series, I think Harry would have been better off without her. It does irk me how in fanon she is always a victim of Dumbledore and was actually a kindly aunty all along, she is a legitimate arsehole in her own right.

**** Not only did she take 150 points for a first offense, she said she was "disgusted" and that she'd never heard of four students out after curfew at once before. (Wow, the Marauders must have never got caught at anything!) But I've already had the argument with somebody here, about whether being out after curfew is such an egregious violation. (I said it was not, they said it was.)

(Of course, this is after she made sure Harry had a broom---a clear violation---just because her house doing well at quidditch is more important than anything else.)

But to me, the most hypocritical thing about that whole episode was Hagrid. They got caught out after curfew because they were covering HIS ass---something he should NEVER have involved students in---and he tells them they have to do the detention if they don't want to be expelled, and that they DESERVE it. /'Yeh've done wrong an' now yeh've got ter pay for it.'/

***** There is a case for Manipulative!Hagrid; he's the one to first bias Harry against Slytherin (contrary to fanon, Hagrid is much more militant against Slytherins, and Ron is much more ambivalent in comparison). Not only that, he is the one to give the trio all the hints to catch on to the Stone and its location, as well as the one to bring them into the secret with the dragon, basically guaranteeing they'd be in some sort of trouble, which would lead to Harry meeting Voldemort in the forest.

Obviously it's a bit of a stretch in places, but I've seen flimsier evidence in most Manipulative!Dumbledore stories!

***** Eh, Hagrid says that to Malfoy, and he may not know exactly what they are being punished for, especially as it is weeks later.

*** I thinks that's why I'd like to see fics with manipulative McGonagall. If you're going to be manipulative, you're not going to want everyone to be able to see it.
