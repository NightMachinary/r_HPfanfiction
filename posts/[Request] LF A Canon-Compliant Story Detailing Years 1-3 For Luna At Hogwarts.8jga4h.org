Obviously Luna bonds with Harry and his friends in her 4th year, so I'm more interested in what her life was like pre-Harry. I'm very curious if a well-written story like this exists. I think it'd be a nice change because it would give insight into the lives of other Ravenclaw students as well. I don't care about pairings as long as the story is good. I'd prefer something Luna-centric, but I won't be picky if she's a background character since I figure it'll be hard enough finding a fic that matches the description.


** I guess linkffn(11923164) counts. It's got an equal, if not bigger focus on Snape, but the author writes Luna wonderfully.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.
