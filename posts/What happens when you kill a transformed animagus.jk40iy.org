I've been thinking recently of a fic idea that I may write, really simple skeeter is spying on Harry and hermione in the great hall and hermione see the insect and she either drops her textbook or purposely smashes the beetle. Now the advice I'm looking comes as to wether hermione lifts up her book and there's a poor crushed little beetle under it, or she's suddenly under investigation by the DMLE because everyone wants to know why the broken and battered body of rita skeeter appeared under her arithmancy textbook.


** The closest canon comes to addressing this is probably Mrs. Crouch's death. As I recall, she dies while polyjuiced as Barry, and kept his appearance after death. Canon is a bit vague on weather the transformation became permanent when she died or if she was buried before the potion wore off, but I think the former is more likely based on what we see.

So in your case, I would lean towards Rita staying as a dead beetle, but I also wouldn't have any problem with you going the other way. Do whatever bus better for your story.

*** In canon transfiguration seems to be permanent until it is either dispelled or another transfiguration is applied. See Dudley's tail having to be surgically removed.

One theory that I saw in a fic was that a magic users magic fights against transformation magics, and so polyjuice wears off because their magic fights it off. This is why Crouch's wife maintained Jr's body after she died, but Barty had to keep drinking polyjuice throughout the year. It also explains why transfiguring a body to a bone works.

So killing Rita in beetle form should leave a dead beetle, as it seems to require active magic to effect the transformation. Equally, this fact could also explain why Animagus' are required to register with the ministry without needing to be big brother about it. After all, if James got shot by a hunter as a stag there would be no way to identify the body without knowing the identifying marks.

*** There is also the fact that Crouch Jr transfigured Crouch Sr into a bone to hide his body.

**** As I recall, Senior was already dead when he was transfigured. That would probably make it an inanimate-to-inanimate transfiguration instead of an animate-to-inanimate transfiguration, so the rules/effects might be different. That's how it works in D&D, at least, which is probably affecting my opinion.

*** Well that's true and I agree with your assessment on the former but that was a potion one that only worked +as most potions do) while the subject was alive and I think it stuck because with the person dead and the potion could no longer turn her back. But it's also said and known that the animagus transformation has little to nothing to do with potions it's a branch of transfiguration isn't it?

**** Yes, the animagus transformation is a type of transfiguration. But polyjuice clearly produces or mimicks a transfiguration-like effect, so there must be some crossover. And according to Pottermore canon, a potion is part of the process of becoming an animagus, so there is some connection.

And as to your first point, if the potion couldn't wear off or turn her back because she was dead, why would the animagus transformation be reversed by death?

** I remember a fic from years ago, when Wormtail was trying to escape while on the Express, and ended up falling under the train. He was later found in his human form, as a completely mangled mess. I like that approach as I see it as the person reverting to their natural form once they die. You could argue against it by saying that Mrs Crouch stayed under the effects of Polyjuice after dying, but it probably would have taken longer than an hour to realise she's dead and bury her, that its more likely that the Dementors, who don't care what she looked like, were the ones who buried her.

*** If it's the same one I'd read, he didn't die after the train hit him. It happened after he woke up from his coma, and found out that that muggle titanium screws don't change size when you shift forms.

He barely managed to change back to human before he bled out, and the case was considered one of the more bizarre unsolved mysteries by muggles for years.

**** Definately not the same one I read, from what I recall he walks trying to cross from one carriage to another when I think Crookshank spooked him, making him fall under the wheels. A chapter or so later there was something about a mangled human corpse being found on the tracks.

** I've written it in the past where they transform back into human. Like, Rita accidentally getting smashed by a door and then reverting back to human in the middle of the great hall as a pile of gore.

**** Nothing new under the sun I'm afraid.

The most notable example I can think of is in HPMoR where Quirrelmort casually kills off Rita by crushing her beetle form when she starts trying to cause trouble for him.

As for your original question, either seems to make sense. Go with whatever results in a better story.

** Well when someone dies, they become non-living(yes ik, solid logic), since its easier to transfigure something non-living than living, I guess a dead animagus would stay in their animal form, stuck because they don't have any more magic to re-transfigure back .

** It's terribly dark humour, but I do enjoy the image of someone slapping a bug and then said bug exploding into a corpse. It's how it works in D&D with shapechange spells, you start with the damage that kills the taken-shape, then the rest of the damage carries over to the human form.

** There's no canon information so you have a bit of freedom with it. In the fics I've read, she either remains a bug or she turns in a bloody mess. Regardless, in all cases, the killer (or the protagonist because I've also read fics where the blame was placed on the protagonist by someone else who believed that the protagonist was revealing too much) was under investigation for being the last person to talk to Rita Skeeter or because she was writing uncomfortable stuff about them.
