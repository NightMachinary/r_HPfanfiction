Forgot the title of the story, so maybe you guys can help (was pretty long ~40 chapters)

- Snape doesn't kill Dumbledore, he just hex off his arm (the one that was in contact with the ring)
- Ron, Hermione, Harry live with Snape in Spinners End and hunt for Horcruxes.
- They get into gringotts via a secret passage, which is located in an old warehouse in London.
- to get nagini they team up with Lucius to get into Malfoy Manor.

The author was a 40ish woman from the UK, with two teenage boys, who has a degree in music?! or something like that. But she tried to focus on writing and was doing courses on that.

Maybe someone remembers this fanfic.

  AU, from Order of the Phoenix onwards. Hermione only wanted to learn Healing; she discovers that Professor Snape is a human being after all, and his actions dramatically shape the course of the war as events unfold. Complete.
