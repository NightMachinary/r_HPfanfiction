  What happens when a brain damaged Harry and a transgender Hermione both get sorted into Slytherin? Snape's not sure, but he thinks it's likely to be an interesting term. This story follows various first years through the trials of their first year.

  Complete. Sick!Harry. Voldemort was defeated in Harry's 6th year. Now in his 7th year, Harry struggles with PTSD. However, surviving the killing curse resulted in more damage to Harry's body than anyone could have suspected. He develops an incurable, unknown form of cancer that only very dark magic can cause. How will everyone deal with it? Deathfic. Trio-centric.

** Have you read Basilisk Eyes?? It's beautifully done, and explores so many physical and mental issues, I love, love it.

As he slays the Basilisk, Harry is doused in blood and venom... some gets in his eyes. Blind!Harry. Disabled OCs. Very slow-build. No pairings.
