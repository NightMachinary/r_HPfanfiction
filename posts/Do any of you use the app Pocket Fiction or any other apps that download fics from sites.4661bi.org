Been having speed issues and potentially looking for a new app on ios. But big up any other format as well for others.


** I've recently taken to just using the iPhone book app to read EPUBs. It's got the Iowan Old Style font as default, and the Sepia tint... /swoons/

Simple pleasures.

*** It's been chugging lately, debating backing up to pdf the stories i have that are no longer on ffn then finding something else.

I checked the store and couldn't find the app when i wanted to see if there was an update recently.

** I used to use [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.loktech.webreader&hl=en][Fanfiction Reader Premium]] . It's has good features like filtering the fics in their respective fandom and ability to backup/import fics

** If you have iOS, you could use iBooks. I used to use Dropbox and read only PDFs, but one day I accidentally downloaded an ePub, an I haven't gone back since.
