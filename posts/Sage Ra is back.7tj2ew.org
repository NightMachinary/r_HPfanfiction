So around 4 months ago Sage Ra deleted all his stories and renamed his account '[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1516835][I'm out of here. Cya]]'

Well apparently he's made [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/9922227/Sage-Ra][a new account]] and as of two weeks ago he reuploaded his stories, specifically [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12798308/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Elemental-s-Power][Harry Potter and the Elemental's Power]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12800980/1/Worthy-of-Magic][Worthy of Magic]], the latter of which has five new chapters.

I figure some of the people here would like to know.


** There's an interesting lesson here if only I knew what it was. The author (if indeed it is the original author) sounds like a bit of an attention seeker tbh. Deleting fics is one thing; just do it and move on like a grown-up. But deleting and then reposting on the same site? It seems to have backfired a bit. A lot of people are accusing him/her of plagiarism, and if he/she did indeed delete previously because of a spammer, looking at the reviews on one story it seems the spammer's back. Or they've found another one.

*** I'd say the lesson is that you need a thick skin if you post your work online.
