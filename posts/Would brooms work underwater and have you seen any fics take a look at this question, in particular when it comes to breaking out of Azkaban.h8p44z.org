** They can work in the rain, so water doesn't deactivate the magic or anything weird like that. That much we know from cannon. As for working entirely submerged in water I'm not sure. They're built with aerodynamics taken into account. I'm not sure how much “power” they'd get underwater, if that makes any sense. I'm sorry I couldn't be more helpful >.<

** While I haven't seen that particular strategy used to escape Azkaban, I have read a few fics where Harry uses his firebolt underwater for the second task.

For the matter of escaping Azkaban underwater on a broom, I would imagine it to be quite difficult as Azkaban is usually quite stormy(at least in most fanfics I've read) and thus the ride out would be extremely rough. There is also the issue that Azkaban will most probably have enchantments preventing broom usage nearby and these may extend underwater too.

Howsoever I don't expect escaping Azkaban to be very easy so this might actually be a viable strategy if one manages to sneak a broom in and escape their cells.

** Imo, the spells on a broom have to specify "in the air", or they'd try to drill themselves through trees and such. Also, they are probably enchanted with some variation of "flying", "levitation", "hovering" charms, none of which are words and spells applicable to water.

So I believe the broom's spell would be disabled as soon as it touches the water's surface. It would float, being made of wood, but it wouldn't work underwater.

However, there might be a way: using a very large bubblehead charm, you could perhaps encase the entire broom inside a large bubble of air, meaning it could dive while inside it.

** How much would being underwater affect the speed?

*** Based on other people's comments, if you could get the broom's motor charms to function underwater, then common sense should affect speed. The wood might be able to deal with a bit of velocity under higher pressure, but surely a human frame would fall apart if you accelerated too fast, even accounting for wizards' unusual constitution.

** If that were a reasonable strategy, we'd expect it to have at least been mentioned as a potential solution for the second task, given how long they spent brainstorming over that one.

If it worked, Accio would then become the new Expelliarmus:

- Accio Firebolt, to outfly the dragon
- Accio Firebolt, to get to the bottom of the lake and grab Ron so fast he wouldn't even need Gillyweed/Bubblehead charm (then he goes back for the others because he got bored)
- Accio Firebolt to fly over the maze
- He isn't holding on to the broom for whatever reason when he grabs the cup, but then he summons it /all the way from Hogwarts/ in the graveyard
- While waiting for it to arrive, during the duel, he summons Voldie's wand, causing Voldie's killing curse to go wide and hit Crabbe (who Lucius is using as a human shield)
- Accio Firebolt again after Umbridge locks it up
- Accio Sirius
- Accio Prophecy
- During lessons with Dumbles, Harry learns that the one spell Voldie failed to master was Accio, making it the true Power He Knows Not
- "Accio Horcrux" fails to summon the one in the cave (as it did in canon), but brings him the /real/ one... and all the others (even Nagini)
- Upon finding out he is the accidental horcrux, he extracts the soul piece from his own body without dying using Accio
- During the battle, from behind Voldie, he summons one of Voldie's own killing curses mid-flight, causing it to return and finish him off for good

*** Now I just want to see a crack fic based on this premise.

** I haven't read any fic that had the broom work underwater. I have read a few where the broom failed when it's completely submerged. Getting a broom wet from rain is completely different than being submerged. In rain the water is a very thin layer even under the heaviest downpour and the broom's own motion would expose different areas to air. Whereas being submerged the entire broom is surrounded by water and there is no exposure to any air.

Of course that raises the question of whether the broom could work underwater if you and the broom were completely enclosed in the bubble head charm.
