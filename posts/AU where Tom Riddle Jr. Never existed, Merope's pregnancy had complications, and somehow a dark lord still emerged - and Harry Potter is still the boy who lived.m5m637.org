** Shed cried enough, she decided. Wiping her eyes, she looked down at the small grave with its conjured headstone.

"They took you away from me," she whispered. The objective truth was that her young baby--Tom, she decided, in "honor" of his father--had very little chance of survival to start. A young woman living off scraps without access to proper care? She was lucky only he died during the birth.

But that didn't matter. If her father had sent her to Hogwarts, if Thomas hadn't jilted her, if, if, if. It was their fault. Her baby's blood was on their hands. They, and the whole world, owed her a debt that could never be repaid.

She'd be damned if she would at least try to collect on it, though.

*** Ok, I get how tom Sr could be blamed in Merope's mind, but why do people feel bad for her. The Voldemort memories in HBP seemed to be written in a way that meant she would be seen as the victim. She raped Riddle. It would take serious stockholm syndrome for tom to stay after that.

**** She was raised so badly that rape seemed like a normal thing to her. She's definitely pitiable.

I haven't seen anyone say that Tom should have stayed with her.

Edited to add: I just noticed that you said people see her as “the” victim. It's very common for people to be both criminals and victims. It's not either/or.

***** Ok yes, I get that point. Even then, how could she expect that he wouldn't dump her the second she stopped drugging him. That takes a lot of wishful thinking, especially since he literally was dating someone else before she enslaved him.

To your second point, I have read a few fics(normally dark edgy Harry) where Tom riddle Sr is portrayed in the same light as the Dursleys, despite literally doing nothing wrong. That's normally an apologist fic tho, so maybe I'm just reading the wrong fics

****** She wasn't raised to be a logical thinker.

Canon didn't tell us much about how Tom eventually escaped. (I don't think of escaping from a rapist as “dumping” someone.) Dumbledore had his ideas, but he didn't know for certain. I have my own ideas about this in my own fic, but there are various ways to extrapolate from the few hints we get in canon.

Ah. I'm happy to say I've never read a fic that bad.

******* Yeah thanks. I've always seen fics where its portrayed as big bad riddle sr dumps poor magical merope who gave up everything to be with him. It's all sorts of messed up, but that's why I said dumped.

Also, what's your fic? I kinda want to read it.

******** She gave up her dirty hovel and abusive family to marry the rich handsome guy? How self-sacrificing. You're making me extra glad I've never read those fics.

Here's Tom after his escape in my fic:

********* So, I saw the pairings on your fic. How does Hermione and Riddle Sr work? At the best, that's a 4 generation difference.

But yeah, you're right. These fics were pretty much the rung above my immortal, but they took themselves seriously.

Edit: Never mind, I understand now. I thought it would be like tom x harry, but this is fine.

#+begin_quote
  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

****** To your first point: self-delusion. She'd been living in a world where she felt she was loved and over time deluded herself into thinking it was real actual love that had nothing to do with the potions. The same thing happens in Weasley-bashing stories, where Ginny (if she's not cold and calculating) always seems to say something like "I knew you loved me deep down; you just needed help showing it!"

For the second, I don't know if the authors of those fics actually believe Riddle Sr. is the bad guy and Merope was just a poor girl who deserves his love (and if they do, ew, that is some massive gross Nice Guy nonsense), but something like that is probably necessary to transform Merope and Riddle Jr. into the good guys.
