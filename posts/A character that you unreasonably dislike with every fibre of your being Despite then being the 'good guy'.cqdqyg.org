For me, it's Lily and James. Ok, they were pretty great people but if I hear one more mention of 'he looks just like James BUT HE HAS LILY'S EYES' I'm going to lose it. Oh my God, 'he is just as smart as them BUT ALSO AS FUNNY AS JAMES'. Harry coughs: 'oh my God Harry I heard Lily cough that exact same way in the good old days, I met her on the train once, it was glorious'.

Not every single trait Harry possesses should be related to his parents. It makes me hate them, like they're perfect in every way. If Harry does something noteworthy then maybe you can adjust that to fit his mum or dad to evoke some sad feelings, but when it's done so much it's annoying. This has evolved into the book canon for me so every time I hear 'just like James, lily's eyes' in the book I get angry again, although Rowling doesn't worship them as much as fanon does. Now, I just roll my eyes at the mention of them.

Luna Lovegood. Unlike Lily and James there is no fanon influence over this one. I disliked her the first time I read OotP and she came on page. Every scene with her in unbearable for me, except the one where she has painted her friends because if was so sad.

I'll get crucified over this but Tonks. Remus doesn't want a relationship with you, stop bugging him please. Please.


** I definitely agree with you that's it's annoying when people attribute every one of Harry's traits to his parents. It's especially prevalent in authors that also write James/Lily or ‚Äúmarauder's era‚Äù fics. I think it's fine to mention some similarities, but I really prefer when Harry gets to be his own person.

It doesn't make me dislike James and Lily as characters though, just get annoyed with the authors.

Ginny. Honestly I'm not sure why, but she seems like she's built by JKR for nothing except being Harry's girlfriend. It makes her a kind of 2 dimensional character, when she could have been such an interesting character if the effect the diary had on her was explored more.

I don't think disliking Snape is unreasonable, but he is supposedly a good guy. However, his constant bullying of children probably did more harm than he ever did good.

I don't like Slughorn at all, he's openly racist (‚ÄúI was shocked a talented student was muggleborn‚Äù ü§Æ) and plays favorites with students. I also think his popularity in the fandom is just people desperate to prove #notallSlytherins and he is the only somewhat significant Slytherin character that is never a death eater or sympathizer at any point.

Molly Weasley: at least she's bashed a lot in the fandom, but among the mainstream fans, she's usually praised a great deal. This person always thinks she knows best, even though she's nowhere competent enough to make the right decision. She's my least favorite Weasley by a wide margin.

** Hermione Granger. She's overbearing in the books, but few called the SI out on her shit. Not once could she not crow about being right, but when she's wrong Harry doesn't gloat. She does it in other books, but HBP sets my teeth on edge. Harry mentions /wanting/ to say something to Ron and Hermione about Malfoy, but holds his tongue. 2-3 chapters later, Hermione is telling him how right she was about the potion's book.

Remus Lupin. Top 10 coward. My biggest gripe isn't even him trying to walk out on his wife and unborn kid. It was that time he was too big of a bitch to mention to Dumbledore that Sirius was an animagus. Imagine if Sirius was actually a mass murderer.

Molly Weasley. Pretty gullible for what a 40+ yr old? Her lack of support for Fred and George's dream always stuck with me. She's overbearing as well and my headcanon is that is why Bill and Charlie went to Egypt and Romania. Was almost the MIL from hell, too.

**** There are literally hundreds of joke shops, and thousands of shops that at least partially sell joke or prank products. Plus, the Wizarding World's economy functions very differently to ours.

First, pranks seem to be much more of a thing in JK's Wizarding Britain than IRL, where I've never seen them past a very young age. Possibly because magic allows for much better pranks, possibly for other cultural reasons.

Second, the Wizarding Economy is tiny and everyone knows everyone. With Fred and George's reputations, and the Weasley reputation more broadly, plus the fact that they can easily sell to literally every kid in Wizard Britain via one hub street and Hogwarts, they have a fairly good customer base and easy access to it.

Third, we already know of one other successful magical joke shop (Gambol and Japes), which indicates that the market is there and it's a viable business.

Fourth, the Weasley's products are extremely innovative and high quality, so much so that they accidentally end up creating genuinely useful military/law enforcement tools - extendable ears and shield hats most notably. This indicates they have good odds of capturing some or all of Gambol and Japes' existing market share by being the newcomers with new ideas - a tried and tested mechanism for a new business to disrupt a market.

Fifth, the small size of the Wizarding Economy, plus the ability of magic to replace money for a lot of purposes, ensures that the Weasleys don't need to become wealthy, just to support themselves, a much simpler task than one might assume.

Overall, it's a market we know is reasonably sized and interested in the product, with only one direct competitor who can't compete on anything but name recognition and established reputation (a benefit that is limited by the contrasting reputation of Fred, George, Fabian, Gideon and the Weasleys more generally). There are only two main avenues to sell via, Diagon Alley and Hogwarts via owl-order (maybe Hogsmeade too) and so not much money or effort needs to go into infrastructure or maintaining a presence - they can invest every penny into one single store.

While it may not be the easiest route to financial stability, I think that it is actually perfectly reasonable for Fred and George to view the shop as a legitimate and well thought out business venture, and that a sober market analysis and look at their business plan (which was solid - building a product collection and customer base via testing at Hogwarts, starting via owl-order to further build brand recognition and loyalty, aggressive marketing even in war time etc) would reveal that making a success of it was well within the ability and motivation of the Twins.

Admittedly, it's certainly more risky than Molly's preferred low level Ministry route, and she would be unlikely to look at the twins' plans with that sort of sober, neutral eye given their rebellious and unserious nature (made worse by the fact the Twins would be unlikely to bother explaining and demonstrating their maturity via a detailed economic analysis and presentation, instead preferring to make jokes and ignore their mum's worries).

Still, I don't think it's totally fair to say that Molly was 100% legitimate in her approach, given that not only did the Twins succeed, but that in my view it was reasonably likely that they would do so from the outset. I think she was too overbearing and confused controlling her kids for supporting them, not realising that sometimes good parenting involves allowing your kids to make mistakes or take risks, and supporting them in that rather than trying to warn them away from all dangers.

***** I mean lets ignore that we don't actually know how innovative etc their products are, we just know they sold a lot of shield hats to the ministry, or how successful the one other joke shop was.

They needed 1000 galleons that the Weasleys were never going to be able to afford to get even slightly off the ground, that they had no viable products before this, terrible grades, and the Weasleys do not have a good reputation (like Fabian and Gideon are mentioned once by Moody, anything else is fanon).

They were 16 when Harry gave them that money. 16 year olds do not get a sober market analysis.

****** We absolutely DO know their products are innovative, from the reactions of all the other characters. Don't be silly.

And we don't need to know anything other than that Gambol and Japes exists and does enough business to get by. Which we do.

They needed start up capital, and given their successful development of multiple products before receiving it, and intentions at that point to finish their schooling, I think it's unreasonable to claim they would never have had enough to open a shop or develop a stock to sell.

They had several viable products, the entire Skiving Snackbox line alongside Canary Creams. They also had Extendable Ears and their fireworks, and portable swamp, very soon after suggesting that at least the plans were already there when they received the start up funds.

Their grades are 100% irrelevant. They would be self employed, and in a field that is ungraded in traditional education and they are demonstrably good at.

The Weasleys have a perfectly fine reputation. They are known as decent, pureblood, and not tainted by any associations with the Death Eaters. The worst anyone says about their reputation is that they're poor, an irrelevance for the business. Fabian and Gideon, IIRC, are described either in the books or by word of god, as being pranksters themselves so I extrapolated from that to assume others around at the time would remember them much like Fred and George, but either way they're not a hugely important part of my argument.

16 year olds who have a deep and fervent passion for one thing and have had plans to do it for a career since a young age are absolutely capable of sober market analysis and a good business plan.

Your argument entirely hinges on your assuming that without Harry's money, Fred and George would have been totally unable to do anything. This is ridiculous, given that they had a good business plan and were at the time they received the money still planning on finishing their NEWTs and would thus have been easily able to save start-up capital given their talents, intelligence and drive.

Oh and here's the kicker: even after they HAD that start up money, Molly still didn't support them even though that was the only possible obstacle to their success.

Poor is irrelevant, and blood traitors only matters to the minority of pureblood bigots. They're still a recognisable, light aligned, pureblood family.

No, they absolutely ARE. If they were the useless wasters you describe them as, 1000 galleons wouldn't have done anything but give them money to piss away. 3 brand new inventions that work well and are genuinely viable products, invented by age 16? That's not the behaviour of someone without ability.

You assume they needed all 1000 galleons to start the business. I doubt that. Especially since they'd managed as students from a poor family to develop and test multiple products.

They clearly had ability and viability. The only thing Harry gave them was money, therefore the only way they could plausibly have failed was without his money, indicating that the money was the only obstacle.

****************** They were fucking 16 and they had invented multiple effective and high quality products, put them through testing and made them ready for sale, in their spare time, with next to no budget. How you can dismiss that is beyond me.

They don't need to sell to build a base. They built a reputation and developed a ready made base for when they started selling.

The method of getting the money is irrelevant - they had it, and that meant their plans were more legitimate

They had consistently put their brand name out there, and constantly demonstrated their products while advertising that they would be selling them, developing marketing language to talk about them etc.

It's absurdly myopic to dismiss their achievements and focus exclusively on the narrow arena of academic success which they explicitly didn't care about.

All of the seeds of the post school success were sown in school, and they could not have achieved it without a huge drive and talent even while they were only 15 or so.

Again: how many 16 year olds design, create and test multiple products, begin marketing them, and actually plan to start a business on graduation, while having sufficient start up capital to make that work? Not many. And the ones that do, usually have parents who at least respect that level of work.

I am suggesting that the fact they did stuff no normal 16 year old would do, and were successful as a result, indicates talent and that their mother should have maybe entertained the idea that they might have a chance. I'm not saying they should have sold the Burrow to buy Fred and George a lab, just that Molly should have understood by HBP that they had an actual, viable plan and the talent to carry it out because...they did.

Andromeda is a non-entity who looks like Bellatrix Lestrange. I like her as a good, ambitious healer. Anything more is meh.

Augusta is a bitch. Forcing a legacy wand on her grandson, despite Ollivander saying only a matched wand will work perfectly. The remembrall is unintentionally cruel too.

There's a sinyk fic where she's bashed, and it's probably the only worthwhile thing to read in it.

From what little we do get of her she seems pretty cool; she turned her back on her family's racist views to be with the person she loved, even though it meant she was disowned, was one of the only Blacks to be kind to Sirius, was good with healing spells, and raised her grandson after losing the rest of her family in a matter of months.

** Ron. I'm not sure is this place fell in love with him because of righteous indignation at how he was portrayed in the movies or what, but man god be with you if you say anything against him here. Dude is a jealous, disloyal, meanspirited prick. He drops Harry like it's nothing twice, once when they're literally fighting a goddamn war. He agrees to go on a date with Hermione, then turns around and sticks his tongue down Lavender's throat because his sister was a meanie pants to her. His bullying is the reason Hermione spent all day crying in the bathroom when she should have been killed by the troll. He's lazy, abuses power, has horrid table manners, only true interest is sports, and has a short fuse and a vicious temper. Seriously, book Ron is a couple roids away from being every meathead stereotype you could think of.

All that being said, I actually don't dislike Ron all that much. His negative are generally mitigated by his positives. But I hate the way how his many flaws are handwaved away here. And in the novel, honestly. Don't even get me started on how terrible the Ron/Hermione pairing is.

  what the hell did Ron really do wrong here. To the extent to get called a Bully?
#+end_quote

Yeah, nothing wrong /whatsoever/ with 'It's no wonder no one can stand her' and 'She must've noticed she's got no friends.' Something he says (even while being 'slightly uncomfortable' as you so helpfully pointed out) *right after he saw he just made a girl cry*.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione singled out a kid when the whole class was not performing well.
#+end_quote

The were directly sitting next to each other. She didn't yell across the room to some meek and struggling kid like you seem to want to portray this as. She corrected the person literally yelling next to her that he was doing it wrong.

I also absolutely adore the bold highlights on things that are pro-Ron as if that's all that you should be paying attention to here. Directly after Hermione 'snaps' at him, Ron /snarls/ back. Not to mention, if you want to make 'snapping' such a terrible thing, that's precisely what Ron does to Harry when he has the gall a short while later to say they have to find the girl Ron made cry since because of that she could be in mortal danger. And directly after Ron looks /slightly/ uncomfortable at, again, making a girl cry, he doubles down on be a complete tool. But yeah, it's definitely poor ickle Ronnikins that's the real victim here. It's not that he was causing a scene next to somebody with a mutual dislike, she corrects him, he says bullshit, she shows him she's right, he gets all pissy, then attacks her character in the middle of a crowded hallway and shows only the 'slightest' of remorse about deeply upsetting her before continuing to say nasty things about her. No, it's all excused because poor Ron was vulnerable.

This is /precisely/ what I'm talking about when I say criticizing Ron is a useless endeavor here. The amount of doublethink required to come out of a situation where one person comes out of it spending the entire day in the bathroom sobbing after saying one short sentence and somehow /they're/ the bad guy is so remarkably absurd I really don't have the words for it.

** I totally agree with you on disliking Luna. In the books I found her weird but didn't really care because she was a relatively minor character. But there are so many fics where she is made into a seer or they make her into a major character and it's just completely stupid. The prime example for that would be linkffn(For Love of Magic by Noodlehammer). I think that fics that want to be realistic should show Harry taking pity on her and sending her to a mind healer because she is clearly not right in the mind because of childhood trauma. Luna is very overrated.

I also can't read a fic where Hermione is praised to the heavens so I guess that means I unreasonably dislike her according to a far too great part of this community.

*** Luna could be a sweetheart of a character if someone just talked to her in a fic. You don't even need mind healers, just a person with a sympathetic ear.

Hermione is an intelligent, if tactless character in canon. She gets classified as borderline genius by Rowling, and in book 2 you see that with her solving the mystery of what the monster is (with a little help from Harry). She's not however smart to the degree you see in fanfics, as she never actually innovates anything.

Snape, the twins, the Marauders, Crouch Jr, Bellatrix (by extension of her defeat Molly), McGonagall, Dumbledore, Voldemort, and Grindelwald, among others are shown to have magical talent that blatantly surpasses her at the same age, through various forms of canon. She only got 10 OWLs compared to 12 quite a few other characters did. She's top of her class, but she's not even a once in a decade talent.

Mind her talent isn't why I dislike reading her in fanfics. Make her as talented as you want, although if you treat her like she's the next Dumbledore with no basis at all, well I'll have an issue. It's how she treats everyone else.

*** Regarding Luna, if you look at the things she says sideways, everything she says or is printed in the Quibbler is in fact true. The creatures she talks about might or might not exist, but JKR obviously had a lot of fun speaking truth encoded in gibberish via the Lovegoods.

I think she's very brave and kind, and grew up with a father who, while loving, is too much in his own head. People often deal with trauma by distancing themselves from the world, especially children, and being weird in a non-malicious fashion isn't actually a character flaw.

*** We're talking about a magical world here. Luna's 'insanity' could very well have some kind of rational reason. My favourite theory is that she's very good at reading emotions and mindsets and such, and it manifests in her mind as different creatures. For example, the wrackspurts are linked with confusion, and nargles are linked with stealing things, so that might be vindictiveness. Luna is a very interesting character who can play major roles in fanfiction.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

***** Dumbledore was so far in the closet even Skeeter doesn't bring it up in her book. Grindelwald literally just became gay like six months ago because JK simply will not shut up. Before that, especially during the Dumbledore gay reveal, it was /heavily/ implied Dumbledore just pined hard after Grindelwald. There's also no non-straight relationships in or around Harry's year, a majority of a century after the fact. They literally /all/ get married, pretty much right out of school, and have babies. There's also no mention of any other character being non-straight at any point in the series whatsoever. Really, if you're hard up on the idea of the death of the author, Dumbledore just didn't want to kill a good friend and there's /no/ mention of anybody not being straight.

There's also no mention of any kind of sex. None of the main characters to anything but make out, and the closet implications were Fleur and Davies at the Yule Ball (though considering they were only half concealed if they were fucking Harry and Ron had a rather blas√© react to seeing them). There /should/ have been sex happening, it's a bunch of teens living together. But there wasn't, and it wasn't really even implied.

It's really not a stretch to say they're behind modern times in relationship as well as everything else. I also have always had an issue with equating Krum to a ‚Äòcollege freshman' when he clearly goes to the same level of school as Hermione. Not that a senior dating a freshman is a great scenario, but it's a helluva lot better than a freshman dating a college student.

Just because they don't use technology correctly does not make them socially different, as they have had technological equivalents.

Skeeter wrote it and lied quite a bit in the book herself. She's not exactly the paragon for journalistic integrity or research.
