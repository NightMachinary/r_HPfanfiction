Oddball group mission as in unexpected team ups.Though not mandatory.

Anyone can be the MC/Any Site/Any Length/Old or New/Completed or Not

Absolutely NO bashing. Flawed characters are a YES, bashed characters are a NO.

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/etc. Does NOT have to focus on pairings.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not, that's fine.

  Harry Potter had won the war, married the most amazing witch of his time, had a beautiful baby and was a successful businessman, when he made a most generous decision towards his younger self. Completely AU, partly OOC, Time travel. Rating might still change!
