I just got done reading an entire Universe's worth of stories I very much enjoyed, in large part because all of the characters were 'real.' This is something I don't think I've ever thought about before - a story was either worth reading, or it wasn't (based purely on writing quality) but this is the first time I've gone deeper on what drives what I think of as 'quality' apart from the obvious spelling, punctuation, and grammar.

This series (which I won't name out of a desire to avoid turning this into a referendum on the stories/author instead of the topic) had great characters throughout, especially the original characters. More importantly, every character in the story was their own person, and was not perfect, or mindlessly following the author's plot notes. After all this reading, I came to realize how important that is to me.

If a character is going to feel real to me, they cannot be perfect. And that's not just in a major, story-driving personality feature way. Little stuff might be even more important in this case

Am I making sense? Am I the only one who thinks like this?

What is critical to you as a reader in order to feel like a character is real?


** Any character has to be included for a reason. They serve a purpose, to guide, to obstruct, to show an alternative option etc. You must have read characters that don't serve a purpose, they're shout outs to the authors friends or something but they're a shitty waste of words.

The difference between a deep character and a shallow one to me is that a deep character is a character that serves a purpose whereas a shallow one is the purpose. Ron isn't just Harry's best friend he's Ron. Oliver Wood isn't just Harry's quiditch captain, he's going to play for Puddlemere, he's Scottish and he's dedicated to quidditch, he's a person who happens to be Harry's captain. Alicia Spinnet is a shallow character. She's the third chaser. She's not a person. She doesn't have her own goals, own personality. She's just the chaser that isn't Angelina and isn't Katie.

*** I think you're mixing up background characters with shallow characters in your example. We don't know much about Alicia, but she's not there for author gratification and certainly doesn't exist to just be a chaser, we see her pop up through the books doing different things and being her own person.

*** I feel like this isn't true. Not everyone has a purpose. Some people just exist because they were born, and they make the best of it. This isn't to say that people should make themselves have a purpose.

In fics, I'm fine with someone just.. existing.

** There are quite a few qualities well written characters should have (and dozens of guides online on how to write them, I'm sure) but to me the most important three are individuality, consistency, and reactivity.

Individuality - Characters should be easily differentiated from others. They should have their own way of speaking, their own turn-of-phrase, their own vocabulary. Your 8 year old Harry and your 100+ year old Dumbledore should not sound the same! (as a corollary to this, the vocabulary should really match the age, I can't count the number of fics where children sound like adults)

Consistency - Characters should not change without a reason. If they have a history of acting a certain way, say...acting with anger/hatred towards a certain house, then they should not suddenly become friends (or more) with someone in that house unless something drastic has changed. If I have to sit there and ask "wait, why in the world would [character] do that?!" then something has been left out. I guess I would sum this up as "Don't be OOC with your own characters."

Reactivity - Or, more properly, how characters act and react. The worst characters are the flat characters. I see characters being written into what should be very emotional scenes: deaths of family/friends, new relationships, ending relationships, battles, etc... and somehow they react with the same tonelessness of sleeping through an alarm or greeting a stranger in a hallway. If your characters are people, let them act like people; with wants, needs, goals, desires. Even if it's not written in to the story (and in many cases it shouldn't be) you can still imagine the history of a character when writing them. A character with trauma in their past will react differently than a spoiled character who will react still differently than a character with a stable childhood. Walburga's Portrait should not have more character than your protagonist.

TLDR: Deep characters have Lives. Shallow characters have Lines.

I think that the inclusion of that little stuff is what makes a character feel deep. You can have an OC tag along every adventure and even influence things, but as long as we don't get to see them beyond what the plot reveals as obvious, they don't feel deep.

A good canon example would be Lavender Brown. She is there for the DA and the Battle of Hogwarts possibly even giving her life for the cause, but the two or three moments when she makes on-screen appearances, we don't get to see all too much about her other than being sold on Divination and overly affectionate. Her pet and whatever fears she might have had are glossed over due to an unreliable narrator and the same can be said about her romance arc in HBP.

At the same time, wasting 5 chapters on music tastes or similar feels like a waste of time and an author opinion insert. You have to find a balance to make a character unique but the uniqueness must not be overpowered (unless necessary for the plot). Give them an unusual but believable family background (eg father died before born, not "descendant of Wiliam the Conqueror") and include the resulting hardships. Make them like one of the less useful subjects. We have read thousands of "Rune-nuts" where the answer to everything is runes, but what if someone likes Astronomy because they like the night sky? What if someone likes the teashop in Hogsmeade because they have the best tea they know? What if, for example, Susan Bones does not get along with her aunt or never sees her due to long hours? Simply doing something new makes a character stand out as well.

Tl;dr: Small things which add to the story instead of just bloating it creates depth.

** Beyond the obvious, three things make characters real for me: change, imperfection, and variation.

1) People change. Stuff happens. It alters who we are, our personalities, our traits. It makes us change our opinions. A characters that goes through a transformation is all the more realistic to me.

2) Imperfection: this one is pretty straightforward. People aren't perfect. They make mistakes. They fuck up. A lot of the time, they are even able to rationalize doing bad things, because it makes sense in the context. Sometimes, that makes them assholes; sometimes not. I've just finished reading Worm, so this one is pretty fucking poignant to me right now.

3) Variation. So many -- /SO MANY/ -- stories become screwed up because the shades of gray aren't parsed. And by that, I mean bad people are portrayed as VERY bad, and good people are VERY good. Well, real people aren't like that. Even the evilest individuals often possess some surprisingly positive traits. A serial-killer rapist can love dogs, for example. Voldemort cared for Nagini. There are shades there. If you, as an author, detest Snape and want to make him an antagonist, that's fine. If, in the process of doing so, you make him dim-witted, arrogant, stupid, creepy, and, to top it all off, he talks like a 12-year-old, then you've just created a cookie-cutter cardboard villain that is not very interesting to read.

** A character being real is having them be somewhere in the middle of the scale between perfect and total waste of space. When one trait or a series of trait are the main drivers behind the character, that's unrealistic. Also, when the plot drives the character rather the character driving the plot.

Edit: mistake in wording.

** Basically the difference between a 2 dimensional character and a 3 dimensional character.

Before I plagiarize this [[http://changingminds.org/disciplines/storytelling/characters/2d-3d_characters.htm][website]], why don't you look at it yourself.

2D characters are simple and unexplained. They appear and they do things, but you don't really get to know them as people.

On the other hand, a 3D character is first of all believable. They appear as credible people you may know. Like humans, they have their own flaws and failings. They are individual and also seek to relate to others.

There is a good chart on that website specifying the differences between a 2D and 3D character.

** You're basically repeating what any novel editor would tell their client. A deep character is one with many layers and facettes, perks and quirks, skills and inabilities, qualities and flaws. Most importantly, any good character will have an agenda, morals, ideals, hopes, dreams and wishes that influence their decisions.

Its really just the delivery of all these things by text that makes it incredibly difficult. From such basics as their speech patterns, to truly small details.
