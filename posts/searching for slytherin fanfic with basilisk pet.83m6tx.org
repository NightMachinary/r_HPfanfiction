[[/spoiler][This Harry is actually Salazar, and the real one is living nicely with his parents in South America.]] He does have a basilisk pest we all know about. And no pairings, as far as I remember.

Can't say I like it as much as I used to. The first time reading was interesting, but I just can't get over the cliches now. It's been a while since I've read it, but I remember the writing was mostly good too.

  Salazar Slytherin has had enough of Dumbledore and Voldemort's stupidity, so on October 31, 1981 he decides to put a stop to the wizarding war. Things do not go according to plan. He loses his memories, but 10 years later he regains them when he gets a familiar letter. Bashing of some characters at first, but it gets better. A twist to the Harry is Salazar genre. More inside...

  ONE-SHOT: After Arthur Weasley nearly dies at the Ministry, Harry wonders why Voldemort's snake isn't something more exotic...really, no self-respecting Parseltongue should limit himself to something as mundane as a regular snake. In which Harry makes use of what he learned in Care of Magical Creatures, Kreacher is forced to cooperate, and the Chamber hides a new Secret..
