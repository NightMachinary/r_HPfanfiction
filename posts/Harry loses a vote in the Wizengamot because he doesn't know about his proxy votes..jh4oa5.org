About all I remember of the story is a scene in the Wizengamot, when Harry is supporting a vote on some measure, and he casts "the Potter and Black votes." The measure fails, because Harry wasn't aware that the Potter and Black families controlled about forty other votes.


** I'm fairly sure this is from The Granger Defence / Great Scott Potter, this is War. Aaran St Vines unfinished fic has a version for both H/H and H/G ships. [[https://aaran-st-vines.nsns.fanficauthors.net/The_Granger_Defense/index/]]

I don't know where to find them other than fanficauthors.net but i do have a PDF of the H/H version. I love it and consider it a loss that it hasn't been updated in so long.

*** That's the one. Thanks. It also had another scene I remembered, concerning the Umbridge family having usurped the Weasley's votes in the Wizengamot.

**** You're welcome! It's a very well written work with a wonderful exploration of politics, but also spellcrafting, traditions, and the kind of experimental magic and potions that i think lacks in many fics. And with so much background detail and weight behind it! I wish he was still writing.

** There is one where all the death eater children become servants to Harry via right of conquest when he defeated voldemort. He now owns all the property and wizengamot votes of all the death eaters. I think it was named 'right of conquest' and was a Haphne fic (WIP last I read)

But its most probably not the one you are looking for. It's similar though
