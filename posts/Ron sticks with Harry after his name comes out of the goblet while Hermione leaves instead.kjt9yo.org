considering how hermione tried her best to follow rules throughout the years (at least in the beginning) I feel like while it would be a little out of character, hermione's dependence on the rules is turned up while her loyalty to her friends is turned down a little resulting in her leaving Harry because she wouldn't want to be friends with someone who ‚Äúentered the tournament‚Äù despite dumbledore's rules. as for Ron, he was a lot closer to Harry in the first few books which could lead to him being able to tell that Harry did not do it at all? Overall this is just smth that my brain came up with (unless there are any fics like this and if so pls reply them üò≠)

** So blah, blah, blah, everything's the same from the get go. Harry is entered. Snape pissed. Karkaroff pissed. Maxime pissed. Dumbledore worried. Fleur's livid. Cedric's midly annoyed. Let's skip ahead to Harry seeing Ron in their dorm.

"Mate," Ron said seriously. "Did you put your name in the Goblet of Fire?"

"No," said Harry. "You know I didn't." The last hour was still ringing in Harry's ears. How was a 'little boy' supposed to compete against three advanced students?

"I know that," said Ron. He seemed anxious. "I knew the second it called your name you didn't. But..." It sounded like he was trying to find the right words.

"What?" Harry said.

"There's going to be a lot of people who think you did," said Ron finally. "We shouldn't care about the Slytherins. The Hufflepuffs will be thick enough to think you did but maybe Diggory will get them to turn around."

"Diggory thinks I entered," Harry groaned. Ron shrugged.

"He's a prat. He'll get over it. I don't know what the Ravenclaws will think. They're supposed to be clever but a lot of them are really superstitious. Most of Gryffindor thinks you did it but are happy about it. Let's just focus on keeping you alive."

"Fine with me," said Harry. He sat down on his bed and began to dig his pajamas out of his trunk. "By the way, what did Hermione say after I left? I didn't see her in the party"

Ron said nothing. He had suddenly become very fascinated by the fabric of Seamus's curtains.

"Ron?"

Ron sighed.

"Hermione said she doesn't think you entered but she's tired of having to make her year revolve around whatever trouble you get into. I don't know if she wants to talk to you right now."

Harry felt very hot behind his neck. One of the few people he was sure would be there for him wasn't.

**** Thanks! It's obvious Hermione wouldn't be jealous of Harry but her thinking "Oh bloody hell, not again." seems possible for a schism.

Her begging Harry for forgivenes later on would be fun to write....

** I feel like this would be a tough one to pull off because I think Hermione understands better than Ron that Harry is incapable of pulling that off. Also she doesn't really seem to struggle with Harry's fame. Also she's broken rules several times so there would have to be a good set up for it to work, but I'd love to read anything by an author who can make this a plausible plot.

*** It'd be tough to do, but it is possible without explicitly bashing any of the character involved. As I've mentioned before, in DH, Hermione is not very quick off the mark when it comes to why Harry is upset with Remus, it doesn't quite click how being an orphan affects Harry. We also know that Hermione is equally able to hold grudges, make tactless comments and be as morally zealous as the boys, so all you really have to do is have Hermione make a tactless comment possibly about Harry's parents in the heat of the moment or something and voila Harry's is too angry to listen, and unable to forgive for a while.

But why would she get angry at him in the first place? She's not jealous of his fame or money, is extremely aware of his abilities and limitations, and doesn't have much qualms about breaking the rules (she only chided Ron a bit when he wanted to get drunk in Hogsmeade). Also, Hermione is pretty tactful in later books and she could usually tell the correct thing to say. Having her make a comment about Harry being an orphan would be /extremely/ out of character and very contrived.

***** "Fine. I've just seen Voldemort murdering a woman. By now he's probably killed her whole family. And he didn't need to. It was Cedric all over again, they were just there ..."

"Harry, you aren't supposed to let this happen anymore!" Hermione cried, her voice echoing through the bathroom. "Dumbledore wanted you to use Occlumency! HE thought the connection was dangerous, Voldemort can use it, Harry! What good is it to watch him kill and torture, how can it help?"

"Because it means I know what he's doing," said Harry.

"So you're not even going to try to shut him out?"

"Hermione, I can't. You know I'm lousy at Occlumency. I never got the hang of it."

"You never really tried!" she said hotly. "I don't get it, Harry-- do you like having this special connection or relationship or what-- whatever--"

She faltered under the look he gave her as he stood up.

"Like it?" he said quietly. "Would you like it?"

"I-- no-- I'm sorry, Harry. I just didn't mean--"

"I hate it, I hate the fact that he can get inside me, that I have to watch him when he's most dangerous. But I'm going to use it."

"Dumbledore--"

"Forget Dumbledore. This is my choice, nobody else's. I want to know why he's after Gregorovitch."

From Deathly Hallows Chapter 12: Magic is Might

Hermione doesn't think before she speaks here. If we presume that she has indeed, matured with age, then it stands to reason that she could make other off-colour comments and possibly much worse. It's not that contrived at all. Equally her actions in POA are the actions of someone who is too sanctimonious for their own good. It doesn't have to be over the top, just enough to make them stop speaking for a while. It happened easily enough in POA.

****** There is a difference between the situations in DH and GoF. In the quote you used, she's trying to /help/ him and just goes about it the wrong way. Meanwhile in the hypothetical scenario you proposed, she's actively against him and makes a jab at his dead parents for no reason.

Also, you still never addressed why she would disbelieve him in the first place. The meaning of sanctimonious is "making a show of being morally superior to others", so she still needs a reason to abandon Harry in the first place, and you can say a lot of things about Hermione, but she isn't /stupid/. In canon, the morning after Harry's name out of the goblet, she literally even says that she knows Harry couldn't have done it since he couldn't have done such advanced magic and he looked horrified when his name came out of the goblet. Unless she's suddenly dumber or harboring a lot of negative feelings towards Harry, it's impossible.

*** I also think that Ron's tantrum wasn't pulled off very well in canon, so personally, I'm not too bothered by how well it's done. It could be something like she thinks the Cloak got him passed, and she reports that. For his own safety, like the Firebolt.
