The only one I know the origin of is Draco in leather pants, presumably becoming popular partly from The Draco Trilogy, though I imagine it would have become popular without those. I'd be pretty interested to know where others came from.


** A lot of blame for various tropes can be laid at Jeconais's feet.

**** Jeconais wrote a number of fics (the only one of which I've read is "this means war") and did a lot of work with OP!Harry. [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/This_Means_War/1__Surprise_Snog/]]

**** I've seen a one shot where this was true, but also Snape was harry's dad, due to Harry travelling back in time to bang Snape's mom. They argued over whether or not Snape was really the Half blood Prince, or some other fraction

#+begin_quote
  After Harry talks to Dumbledore in Deathly Hallows, he takes a little detour to Spinner's End, back before it was Snape's house, back when it belonged to a woman named Eileen Prince. Snape couldn't be angrier when he finds out Harry is his father.

** Spinning portkeys. First used as a central plot device in "The Power of the Press" by Bobmin.

Now it's everywhere, but never a necessary part of the plot.

"Yeah, this author has obviously read Bobmin."

If you want to deviate from the book canon, at least stay with the movieverse.

**** Nah, but theres the scenes where Ron is nothing but a useless lump. Where Hermione is incredible beautiful and perfect in every way. Where Snape and Draco are beautiful people. Where Dumbledore is a bumbling oaf.
