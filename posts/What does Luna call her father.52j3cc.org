*** I did quite a bit of reading to figure this out.

She tends to call him "Daddy" to his face and "Dad" when talking to others about him.

#+begin_quote
  Xenophilius, who was deep in conversation with an acquaintance, had missed the exchange between Luna and Harry. Biding the wizard farewell, he turned to his daughter, who held up her finger and said, “*Daddy, look*---one of the gnomes actually bit me.”

  “How wonderful! Gnome saliva is enormously beneficial,” said Mr. Lovegood, seizing Luna's outstretched fingers and examining the bleeding puncture marks. “*Luna, my love,* if you should feel any burgeoning talent today---perhaps an unexpected urge to sing opera or to declaims in Mermish---do not repress it! You may have been gifted by the Gernumblies!”
