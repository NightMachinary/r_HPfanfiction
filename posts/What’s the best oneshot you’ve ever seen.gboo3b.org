  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

** Really not an expert on Harry potter fanfiction because I read the books more than ten years ago and only started reading fanfiction last year, but I really like linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15695769]])

As an adult I don't see the Ministry changing. The way post-war period was managed in both wizarding wars make doubt about the magical world surviving an ever evolving muggle world either they get nuked into oblivion in a close future or turned into slave. They really need to change and adapt if they want to survive us, the mundane.

The old rotten institution being razed by a Dark Lord Harry Potter turned mad because of all the dreadful experiences he had during the whole series is a bonus. The thematic that a close death, or a true death followed a revival still make you feel like you lost a part of yourself is also interesting. Of course being the master of death also change him into something even him doesn't understand, it's not just the cheating God like Wizard that master of death tends to be described in Fanfiction.
