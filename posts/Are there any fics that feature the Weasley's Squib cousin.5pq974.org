"‘Are all your family wizards?' asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him. ‘Er -- yes, I think so,' said Ron. ‘I think Mum's got a second cousin who's an accountant, but we never talk about him.'"

I enjoy stories that explore squibs, but I haven't come across any about him. Why do they not talk about him? Is it because he is a squib, or is it because he's an accountant and they are terrible at managing money?

Corporal Prewitt overhears a muttered complaint about wizards and is drawn into a discussion of the Wizarding World. He's involved but not a featured character.

****** An editorial misspelling.

Probably. Both spellings are common enough, it's like someone not picking up on Rachel vs Rachael, or Mich(a)el, birth certificates and passports make these mistakes more often than you'd think. Because Prewitt is Welsh, it has plenty of different spellings. My boyfriend actually has distant cousins with a differently spelled surname, due to mistakes back before computers.

**** If you haven't read it already, I'll warn you, it's not very good in my opinion. It's interesting, but it's basic premise is "Muggles! Fuck Yeah!", and the Magical people being assholes about /anything/ to do with Muggles. I tried to read it, but it's just to bashy to both of them to be too good.

** I have used him ias a side character in a couple of stories but I don't think I ever explicitly state who he is - or perhaps very briefly, I forget.

I think the Weasleys don't mention him because he's a squib and they are ashamed or embarrassed. Being a squib is always presented in a negative light in canon as I recall. Bit unfair really.

edit spelling

Also edit because I don't see the Weasleys as being 'terrible at managing money', they just don't have enough of it coming in. Of course that does open up the whole can of worms about the complete illogicality of Rowlings economic system, but that's another matter.

*** Canonically, Hogwarts education is free

It's heavily implied that wizards are in a post-scarcity society. It's canon that as long as you have a little food, you can transfigure more from it.

Somehow, the Weasley's are poor.

  Why do they not talk about him?
#+end_quote

According to information about cut character Mafalda, it's his fault.

#+begin_quote
  Mafalda was the daughter of the 'second cousin who's a stockbroker' mentioned in 'Philosopher's Stone'. This stockbroker had been very rude to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley in the past

**** Huh, I think I've figured out who the cousin is. Cedrella, Arthur's mother, had a first cousin who was a squib, Marius Black - burned off the family tapistry and disowned. Given that his brother was Pollux, who raised Walburga and Cygnus, you can imagine what kind of a messed up kid he was. Raised as a Black, then kicked out to the Muggle world.

He would, in fact, be a first cousin once removed to Arthur, and probably a second cousin to Ron, or close enough that everyone would just use second cousin.

I'm not entirely sure how it works out, since Molly's uncle was married to Marius's first cousin once removed, and Molly wasn't actually blood related, but it's possibly that side of the family took him in.

**** Aunties are different to cousins. Molly probably grew up seeing her as much as she saw grandparents, but in large families, second cousins don't tend to be very close. Or, in any sized families, really. Teddy and Scorpius, for example, would be second cousins, and I don't see them being that close, except for Scorpius's friendship with Teddy's god-brother.

Cygnus and Walburga Black were second cousins to Arthur. Arthur's mother, was first cousin to their father, Pollux. This makes Arthur second cousin once removed from Bellatrix, etc, and I think Ron and Draco are third cousins once removed.

*** There's this one story where the twins basically forced ron to swear on his magic to never tell on them. Then, sometime later, ginny's hurt, I believe, and they basically force him to run and tell their mother which strips his magic. He ends up goong to live with his squib cousin who's actually james bond, not an accountant. It was pretty good if I recall correctly.

Edit: i remember, as much as I dislike Ron, I was really choked up at the end. Then the reveal made me so excited.

  An assortment of Harry Potter one shots. Though listed as "Humor/General," the collection also contains Drama, Horror, Family, and Tragedy, as well as a few experimental fiction stories as I work out my stylist chops. Contain crossovers with several fictional worlds, including the Cthulhu Mythos, Starship Troopers, Star Wars, and James Bond.

  It's been said that little things can change the world, and they can. But then, so can big things. This is the story of the big things that happen when Ron Weasley meets his mother's cousin, the Accountant they don't talk about. Ron learned that there is more to life than magic. Sometimes a skill gained by accident is all you really need to change the world.

*** Yes of course he is an OC to all intents and purposes, but it's tidy to be able to connect an OC to a canon character in some way. Plus a squib is a useful bridge between wizards and Muggles, and canon already hints at a story to be told. Which in my opinion is what fanfiction is all about,

*** I like stories that explore how Squibs are treated. There aren't many that write about Filch and most of the ones that mention Figg are more focused on Harry. The character may be a blank slate, but the connection to the Weasleys could potentially be interesting.
