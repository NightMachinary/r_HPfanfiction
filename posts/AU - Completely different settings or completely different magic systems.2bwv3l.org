Title says it all; I've recently become interested in completely different settings and/or magic systems. I probably would just read other books but I'm too attached to HP characters :p. Anyway, something complete is preferable, as well as something pretty long.


** The one I like best is the firebird trilogy. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy][book 1 here]]

It's a very different AU that has a much more mature view on magic. Don't let the seemingly juvenile premise of "more women than men, therefore everyone has a harem" fool you. This story is very dark and not at all a male fantasy world.

** Well, if you haven't read it already, I'd point to you the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374917/Inverarity][Alexandra Quick series by Inverarity]]. While I stopped reading the series because of personal tastes, I think it is really well written and has a completely fleshed out American magical society. I know a lot of people really love it and it gets recced here all the time.

** Incomplete but fantastic in very interesting ways:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8616362/1/Harry-Potter-The-Last-Avatar][Harry Potter: The Last Avatar]] by The Sorting Cat.

A crossover (you don't need to know much but the series is fantastic and what are you doing with your life if you haven't watched it?) with Avatar: The Last Airbender. Each house is a different element of bender. Read it. So good.

I'll also throw out one of Taure's (who I've been linking all over this subreddit) where the magic system will make you squee and wish it was complete. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5755130/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lords-of-Magic-I][Harry Potter and the Lords of Magic]].
