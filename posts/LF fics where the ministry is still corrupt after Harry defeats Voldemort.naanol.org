Harry's response to the continued corruption and bigotry doesn't matter (in terms of the request). Thanks!

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** The Sum of their Parts (above) is the best one that I know of.

Another one, not yet here, is /Made of Common Clay/ which lambasts the typical "Lord Harry" type fic. I suppose I liked this one well enough, though I thought it pulled out sudden, easy magical solutions invented by the author too often (especially the final deus ex machina solution). And I didn't really like this older Harry. His character (and some of the other characters, especially the OCs), fell flat for me. On the other hand, I really liked how the author explored the ways that bigotry and prejudice infect everyone--including the good guys--and make it hard for a society to truly stomach change. It's a genfic. linkao3(11699844).

  Harry has reached a very bitter and jaded thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the corruption or pure-blood bigotry one bit. That's when he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of before; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear the system down and salt the earth. And with a double Lordship, he just might have the power to do that.
