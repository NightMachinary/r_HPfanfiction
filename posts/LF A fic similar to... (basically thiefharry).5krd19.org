I know linkffn(5427182) is only 13k words and unfinished, but I'd really like to find something similar to it or at least having some of it's elements.

  -AU- Harry Potter's funds are dwindling. To correct that, he plans a daring heist: stealing the Philosopher's Stone. But with Dumbledore guarding it, the Girl-Who-Lived watching him, and someone else after it, he may have bitten more than he could chew.

** I liked linkffn(5199602) - this definitly fits your description, it's thief!Harry.

I is a lot of fun. While Harry may be a bit "overpowered" it's still a /lot/ of fun to read.
