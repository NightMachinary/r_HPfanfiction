******* Yeah, pretty much that. I don't have anything against the nickname in particular, but most authors who do use “Mione” do it without any care that it is just Hagrid-speak of someone who is eating and talking at the same time and that he really is saying “Hermione” but the “Her-” part, already less audible than the rest, is simply lost in transit. And this means that most authors who do use it do unspeakable things to canon, to the point where it often is cringe-worthy to read.

So yeah, nothing against the nickname as it is, it is a possibility, however low, for some character to start calling her that way. But it's a red flag, the same way “should of” is (which exists because some people took “should 'ave” which is also Hagrid-speak and then decided that clearly “'ave” is the same as “of” because eff research of something); seeing it is a really bad sign for the likelihood of the story being good.

While "Leader of the Light" is understandable, there are several instances in the books that would suggest that Light magic is, indeed, a branch of magic. With the presentation of "the Dark Arts", and the conflict of Harry and Dumbledore vs. Voldemort, that all also points to a "Dark vs. Light" scenario. Black is portrayed as evil, whereas white is portrayed as good.

Examples of probable light magic:

- Patronus Charm

- Lumos / Lumos Maxima

- Other DADA spells, counter-curses, counter-jinxes, etc.

**** I agree that if there were such a thing as Light Magic (which isn't my interpretation), the Patronus charm qualifies. However, it's the only spell we ever learn about that harms Dark creatures and requires positive emotion and for all we know it is unique in that regard. Even Dumbledore, surely a master of 'Light magic' if it exists, uses normal fire spells to fight Inferi, not a fancy 'Harm Undead' Light spell.

I don't see why a glorified lamp would be considered pure or good - just because it produces light doesn't make it Light. Most hexes, jinxes, and even curses that students learn the counters for probably aren't Dark magic; countering a Jelly-legs Jinx hardly seems like 'Light' magic. I don't think we ever see them learning how to counter Dark curses - how would they practice? They'd hardly be able to cast Dark spells on each other to learn the counters.

**** One can classify spells however one wants, but it's not a canon classification, and, except for the Patronus Charm [1], bad guys can use the so-called "Light Magic" just as easily as good guys. "Dark wizard" and "Dark witch" are used throughout; but "Light wizard" or "Light witch" not once. Having a separate category for it is like having a separate word with a separate root for "any object in the universe that is not an a fruit".

[1] There was some Word of God that Snape is the only Death Eater who can cast it. To me, stuff outside the books is optional, so I am inclined to reject that, since it implies that, say, Lucius loves Narcissa and Draco less than Snape "loves" Lily.

"In 1981, on Hallowe'en night, young Hadrian Potter's parents are killed... by Albus Dumbledore. He then is sent to live with the filth that share his blood. In 1991, on September first, Hadrian travels to Hogwarts after receiving his letter, but what Dumbledore wasn't expecting was for their "hero" born from the dark, to survive his childhood. Now, Albus Dumbledore has to deal with the monster of his own creation, Hadrian James Potter.

****** Low-capacity shotguns are the easiest guns to obtain legally in the UK, if I'm understanding this correctly. For anyone interested in details:

#+begin_quote
  Fully automatic (submachine-guns, etc.) are "prohibited weapons"[15] and require explicit permission from central government to permit ownership. Generally, such permits are not available to private citizens. Semi-Auto rifles over .22 in (5.6 mm) and pistols are similarly "prohibited", although there are exceptions for short barrelled breech-loading semi-auto and revolver pistols for use for the humane dispatch of animals (classed under section 5). There are also very limited exceptions for pistols both to preserve firearms of historic or technical interest (classed as section 7 firearms)[16] and to enable use by elite sports teams. Semi-auto shotguns are legal.[17] All other rifles and their ammunition are permitted with no limits as to magazine size, to include: target shooting, hunting, and historic and muzzle-loading weapons, as well as long barrelled breachloading pistols with a specific overall length, but not for self-defence; however if a home-owner is threatened they may be used in self-defence, so long as the force is reasonable.[18] Shotgun possession and use is controlled, and even low-power air rifles and pistols, while permitted, are controlled to some extent. A firearms certificate issued by the police is required for all weapons and ammunition except air weapons of modest power (of muzzle energy not over 12 ft·lbf (16 J) for rifles, and 6 ft·lbf (8.1 J) for pistols). Shotguns with a capacity of three rounds or less (up to guns with a magazine holding no more than two rounds, in addition to one in the chamber) are subject to less stringent licensing requirements than other firearms and require a shotgun certificate; shotguns with higher capacity require a Firearms Certificate.

#+begin_quote
  "So mote it be" is a ritual phrase used by Freemasons, in Rosicrucianism, and more recently by Neopagans. It means "so may it be",or "so must it be", and may be said at the end of a prayer in a similar way to "amen". The phrase appears in the Halliwell or Regius Manuscript, the earliest known document relating to a society of Masons in England dating from the first half of the 15th Century. "Amen! amen! so mot hyt be! Say we so all per charyté".

  The phrase has been taken up by neopagans and they use it in a similar way in their ceremonies and rituals.

Wizarding Britain celebrates Easter and Christmas and while we can probably assume Wizards of other cultures hold other beliefs, the canon characters can probably be safely assumed to be of a monotheistic background.

I'm heartily tired of reading about Snape "pinching the bridge of his nose", yes he has a big honk, but how did this become such a "thing"?

***** I don't want to presume, but based on my limited knowledge of emigrating to Canada, is it fair to assume that the British expats you know are fairly middle class? Because that will have a big influence. The more middle class you are the less likely you are to use both of those words. It's a fairly common joke over here that a really posh person will try to relate and get along with his builder or plumber by calling him mate a lot, because it always sounds unnaturally forced from the middle class.

Mate is definitely still in very common usage though, and snog did have a resurgence around HP-mania. But as more and more Americanisms have filtered into our language it seems to me that it's declined in use. I will say though that I don't think 'makeout' has quite made it over here properly though.

Though it's been a year or so since I watched it, so I dunno.

**** No, I'm not. I just hate the way the word "mate" appears in every single thing Ron says, in some fanfics. I mean, maybe some British people really do use the word that often.

"As Dumbledore would tell you," he added with pride, "I have uttered that sentiment once.

***** And "thongs" are shoes. If you're going to purposefully misunderstand words, why even discuss it? "Panties" or "bras" aren't exactly the sexiest of words either. But if you're writing Harry Potter fanfic, you're likely writing about 11-18 year olds in early 90s Britain in the equal shadows of past and future wars. Sexy words for clothing aren't really relevant. What do you think they're going to call them if it comes up?

Based on the there/they're/their confusion I read daily, a little knicker/nicker confusion isn't even notable. :-)

** “Okay”, “OK”, and other stuff of this sort.

I mean, sure, they are popular nowadays. But they weren't in the nineties, and especially not in a society as insular as the wizarding one. I can accept it when used occasionally in humorous stories because it's easy to ignore when you are laughing so hard that your neighbours can't sleep, but when it's a seemingly serious story and half the replies have slang words out of their time, sorry but just no.

Gets more annoying when you see older characters using this travesty of a reply. Because seeing Tom Riddle or Minerva McGonagall use that ... yeah, that's bad.

*** I agree that it's jarring to see certain characters use words like okay and other slang (I'd add Snape to that list, he is usually rather formal) because it doesn't match their speech patterns as Rowling has written them.

Having grown up in the eighties and nineties, though, I certainly don't agree that "okay" or "OK" were less prevalent then! OK is very old slang and, although it doesn't look quite right in Harry Potter, in my real-life experience 70-year-old people are just as likely to use it as younger. Maybe that's more of an American vs. British thing, though?

**** Yes, quite.

In the United States, the word existed and was in use in the 19th century, and might have even earlier than that.

In Europe however, including Great Britain, it is very much a 20th century thing, and more late 20th century than early 20th.

So that some people in the eighties and nineties would use it in Great Britain? Sure, I'm not saying nobody would. But characters in the Harry Potter series, who are either living in an insular society, are Dursleys with their own dursleyish approach to anything, or don't really interact with any youths who could have learned to use that word ... yeah, no way.
