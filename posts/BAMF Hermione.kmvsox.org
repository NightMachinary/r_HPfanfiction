Hello everyone! I'm looking for stories that featuring a very capable Hermione, extremely capable with dueling, mind magic, fighting, a spy etc. Fics along those lines! I always love Hermione's intelligence and that paired with some kick ass skills usually make for some really great fics! I feel like I've read everything! Thank you to anyone who drops a rec (:


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/][Divided and Entwined]]: Guerrilla Hermione takes on rank and file Death Eaters, Dumbledore manipulates the Ministry and prepares Harry for his direct confrontation with Voldemort. But the trouble does not end with Voldemort's defeat.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12614436/1/][Hermione Granger, Demonologist]]: Adorably dark Hermione makes friends with both Harry and Voldemort.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: Non magical sci-fi AU with an awesome Trio

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]]: Overthrowing the incorrigible establishment of Wizarding Britain is only the beginning, and there's a very good reason why Victor Krum is a main character here.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13270949/1/][Hermione Granger and the Power of Atom]]: Only an one shot, but very amusing

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/][Stages of Hope]]: This Hermione has suffered much, but she is also totally a bad ass.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][The Arithmancer Trilogy]]: Super Hermione carries the war pretty much by herself.

** Confectionary Chronicles has a BAMF, intelligent, and capable Hermione. She does go through some stuff to get there, so the BAMF isn't immediate, but it does definitely get there.

It is a Supernatural crossover, but you don't need to know anything about Supernatural to read it (I literally know nothing about it beyond that there are two brothers and a gay angel and they go to hell a few times - I haven't seen a single episode).

**** Enjoy. Oh, and a warning - it starts off with a vivid, but inexplicit suicide scene. If that's something that bothers you, skip to the paragraph after the first linebreak that starts with "After the funeral, Helen and Richard decide to move away from the area."

** Linkffn(Paradox by olivieblake) Fits your request perfectly.

Linkffn(New Blood) Has an actual Cunning!Hermione instead of everyone merely describing her as bright.

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means. ((Short chapters, done scene by scene))
