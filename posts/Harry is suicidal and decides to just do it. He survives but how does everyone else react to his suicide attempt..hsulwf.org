** linkffn(10216145) This one is /exactly/ what you are looking for.

linkffn(Recnac Transfaerso) : A slow one as Harry make the choice of taking on the cancer that was killing a muggle and the illness is slowly killing him. A lot of abuse thrown in there so don't go if it's not your thing.

  Harry is at the end of his rope; he's no saviour, he's just a frightened and hurting adolescent who has been asked to do too much. The prophecy was the last straw. Can McGonagall do something now? Or is it too late? Trigger Warnings on individual chapters although suicide is a strong theme.

  Katelyn Potter, the 'Girl Who Lived', is miserable at Hogwarts. She's ignored, or despised and looked down on - so she decides to leave it all behind and join the only two people who ever loved her. However, her attempt to take her own life fails, and she's left to pick up the pieces. TW: Suicide attempt in 1st chapter. Mentions of abuse. !femharry
