Any fics where a character changes some fundamental aspect of the wizarding world for the better, either with greater efficiency or more modernism. I'm especially looking for either fics where it follows a headmaster or teacher in hogwarts who is radical/awesome in the way he brings about change. completed fics or frequently updated.

Thanks!

It's by the same author. Harry becomes a Defense teacher at Hogwarts during the Marauder era and brings some changes. It's also updated pretty frequently. Have you looked through the rest of author's stuff? He has another fic that's about Snape when he becomes Slytherin's Head of House so maybe that might be what you're looking for as well. I haven't read it but it is completed.\\

  Severus Snape is confronted by the Lone Traveler on the Eve of his ascention to Slytherin Head of House. The visiting Harry teaches him to change the course of Slytherin and all of the Magical world. All he has to do is get them to open their eyes. The major portion is almost exclusively in the viewpoint of Severus Snape. Now with Lucius Malfoy thrown in.

  Young Harry liked numbers, he liked using numbers and working out the value of things. When he found out that he was a wizard and had a big pile of gold... well, he had something new to calculate. oneshot, complete, don't own.
