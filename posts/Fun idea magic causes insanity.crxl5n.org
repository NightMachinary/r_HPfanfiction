Barnaby the Barmy. Wendolyn the weird. Uric the oddball. Dumbledore.

An unusual number of famous wizards are bonkers.

What if magic makes you insane? Maybe wands slow it down. Maybe only certain spells do it. Maybe muggles are muggles because their magic is too busy holding onto their sanity.


** There's a One-Shot about Hufflepuff house and their induction process for first years and explaining that certain magics that all the other houses use all the time causes eventual insanity and it's the hufflepuffs responsibility to stay sane and avoid using those magics.

  It's 1991, and eight newly Sorted wizards and witches are about to start their first night in House Hufflepuff. There'll be singing and camaraderie and macaroons and only a little bit of screaming. Arguably AU.

** In the Call of Cthulhu roll playing game, doing magic by definition causes insanity. Although it's heavily implied you need to be insane just to want to do it.

Though that universe's spells are a but more.... balls to the wall. For example, the ritual for casting the equivalent of polyjuice requires the person to consume every single bit of the body of the person they're going to impersonate (though they can do it over several months and it's permanent so they can subsequently change appearance at will). Overall, the CoC grimoire makes making Horcrixes look a bit wimpy - I mean, you only need to kill /one/ person.

It'd be interesting if there's something similar in the HP universe, bured deep at the back of the most secure part of the restricted section. Spells that even Voldemort would just nope the hell away from.

**** /Consume likeness/, I think. It was from an old edition so they may have taken it out. I can't check as I gave the book to somebody.

** To me, it looks like magic itself actually keeps the madness at bay. /Using/ the magic, as in, directing the power away from where it is, causes madness. If the magic is left to stay without disturbing, it helps with mental wellbeing.

Though, madness as a word is too harsh on our examples.
