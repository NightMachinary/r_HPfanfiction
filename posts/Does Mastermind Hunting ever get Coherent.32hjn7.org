So, Mastermind Hunting has been recommended a few times here, and supposedly is worth the ending. Which I have been told is pretty bad. When I tried to read it though it just seems like an incoherent mess. It just kind of seems to be jumping around the place. I am currently on chapter 7 and was wondering if anyone could tell me if it ever gains some focus.

Besides that I do love kung-fu wizards, no matter how cheesy it is. Anyone have some good stories with kung-fu wizards (Preferably not just Harry), or even just an interesting form of combat?

** Yeah no it's really doesn't. But honestly, even the bad stories are worth reading to a certain extent. As a whole, most (probably 80%+) of the recommended stories just aren't good as a whole, but almost every single one has their own little Crowning Moment of Awesome that makes you go "holy shit this is so fucking cool!" Mastermind definitely ends on a sour note, but then so does Unsung Hero, and that's highly recommended too. My philosophy is "just read it". Except for pure smut, I will even "just read" those mpreg snarry and drarry fics I love to hate. Can't stand them as a whole, because of the rampant ignoring of all the nasty shit they did, and they're generally never written well, but I still have read a lot of them because there are often scenes that are interesting or inspiring (as a writer) to me.

*** I like this. Honestly I think I just have higher expectations for stories recommended here. Which isn't fair, I should hold them up to the same standards that I would hold to random ones I stumble upon.

**** No I think it's perfectly fair to a certain extent. You wouldn't expect someone to reccomend a non-self-aware My Immortal here on the sub because we know to filter out such garbage. On the other hand we have widely varying taste and we often disagree on recs between ourselves so a recipient of the recs should also understand that not only is there a chance they may not like a recommendation, they may vehemently despise it. I think it's most fair to say we won't recommend a story with major technical issues but as far as plot and pacing anything goes.

***** Taste is so subjective. I remember recently going through someones favorite lists and about 99 percent of it was spot on with my taste, and then there was one that was so far out of left field it left me stunned. But, you are right, I don't remember reading anything with technical problems here.
