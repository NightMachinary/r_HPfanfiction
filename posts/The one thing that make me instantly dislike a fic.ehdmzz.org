When they give harry The Talk. Like, I know, Dursley's would never do it, but the boy went to school dammit! He's at least knowledgeable of the technical aspect of it! If you absolutely /must/ have The Talk, at least fade to black? Except to show that Harry's thick in the head and innocent in the soul, it's got no reason to exist plot-wise. I know this makes me sound like an awkward 10yo, but seriously.


** Can you honestly say this isn't funny

  the boy went to school

Yeah, in the 80s. I went in the 90s and the two talks in school I got were infinitely different from each other. The primary/elementary school one was so basic it was barely useful at all. That was "Hey, this is puberty, tab A goes into Slot B. No means no. Wait for marriage." And then came middle school. That's where they taught mechanics, the diseases, pregnancy, etc. It was more in depth.

â€‹

Seriously, if you ever have to give the talk, you explain the mechanics of it. Everyone explains it differently. And a school teacher can sometimes be a prude, a religious zealot, or not even know themselves. The talk is something you don't want to infer that someone knows already. It's too important a topic to do that with.

And the /talk/ when it is given by a family member is usually explaining the mysteries of girls. And how they can't really be explained.

*** This. Harry left public school at 10, and I can't speak for 80s English primary education but the 90s US equivalent only grazed it in the 6th grade after a girl had her first period in class and my male teacher felt obligated. I was 11.

*** Yep. Harry's like 2 years older than me, and we didn't cover true sex ed until middle school (aka Hogwarts-age). Grade school only covered "if somebody touches you in the bad place, tell a trusted adult." My mother was the one who gave me the talk, complete with pictures she made on my Magna-Doodle.

Granted, this was in the US. I dunno if the UK was more progressive.

**** Not sure about the comparison between now and then, but US is generally fairly backwards in that regard so chances are it could be more progressive. It doesn't have to be, no, but it could potentially be.

** The best talk I've seen was Sirius saying to Harry infront of Dumbledore

"Harry, you know what sex is?"

"Yea?"

** He went to elementary school in the eighties. I don't know how England did it back then, but I only got the talk in seventh grade. Harry didn't have any friends before he went to Hogwarts and tbh that's where most kids hear about it, then they maybe ask parents or siblings about whatever garbled version they heard. It's highly likely Ron was the one who clued him in, because I very much doubt the Dursleys bothered, and, although I agree with you, OP, that reading about Harry getting the talk is not something I at all enjoy, it's very probable that Harry didn't know jack-shit until he was a lot older than most kids are when they learn the basics.

** The fact is, Harry's sexual knowledge is almost never portrayed somewhere in the middle.

It /should/ be, in my opnion, I think it makes it more realistic. It's always either Harry barely knows what a penis and vagina is, or it's SomehowSexGod!teenager!Harry, who can pleasure any woman just by looking at them.

** Really? A situation that would logically fit in the mythos and has great potential is your one turn off?

I mean, sure, most of them are bad. But 90% of fanfic is bad writing will a huge portion of that way below professional level. I don't see it as any worse than most of the flubs out there.

Maybe you find the hook interesting, so you read further than you do otherwise? I know some of my preferred situations/pairs will get me to read a lot further than I normally would.

I mean, this is one I can easily imagine being good. As opposed to a dozen of premises that are instant nope. Like teacher/12 year old antics. There is really no redeeming that.
