I've mostly read Hermione/Luna exclusively, but I'm seeking to branch out, so to speak.

To give more of an idea of what I'm looking for, here are some fics I enjoyed:

linkao3(25270; 305418; 2476235; 801068; 2573990; 1905703)

I know they're mostly fluffy romances, but I'm okay to read any genre or rating as long as they're written well.

Thanks!

**** It should be able to. It has the command printed in the sidebar.

What if I copy and paste the line from the OP?

**** Not exactly sure why this is happening. I won't be able to really look into this issue for another week or so due to an overwhelming quantity of /work/, so try sticking to names for now.

Sorry about this.
