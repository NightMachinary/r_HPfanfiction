I fee that this is an unappreciated pairing, and I'm in the mood to read a good fluffy (or any type of story with this ship really) fanfiction. So please link me to any you like and have read. Thank you for taking the time to do this!


** Currently following "Firebird's Son" by Darth Marrs. Very AU, and so far there's very minimal contact between Harry and Luna, but it promises to be extremely interesting. Very well written.

*** OP asks for a "fluffy" story about Harry/Luna and you give him "Firebird's son"?

Great story, don't get me wrong, but it's not at all what he asked for.

I know it's not fluffy. It is, however, extremely good so far, and Luna's made plenty of appearances, albeit in unconventional ways.

**** A couple of fair warnings:

A) They are currently 39 chapters in, at the end of the fourth year, and Luna did not make an appearance yet. This is not at all a Harry/Luna story by any conventional means. The only way we "know" that is because the author spoiled it himself in the description. In-universe it is Harry/Hermione more than anything else.

B) It is extremely, and I mean EXTREMELY, AU. This is basically set in a completely different world that only barely resembles the normal universe.

C) It's quite mature in content. It includes graphic descriptions of murder and rape and it's not at all "fluffy" like you asked.

** I'm surprised no one has mentioned [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7352166/1/Protection-From-Nargles][Protection from nargles]]

#+begin_quote
  Harry and Luna meet in the Room of Requirement. Mistletoe appears. Will Nargles be a problem? Takes place in during Harry's fifth year, as he and Luna get closer. Basically pure fluff, largely consisting of conversations. NOW COMPLETE.

**** You're welcome--glad to be of help.

It doesn't take that long, actually. I have a C2 with a bunch of stories I could imagine wanting to read again (or recommend to folks someday) and did a quick search through there.

Incidentally, nonjon's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4746187/2/What-a-Bunch-of-Nonjon][The Empire of Earth]] one-shot is also Harry/Luna.
