:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Harry walks into the Great Hall, asks what Dumbledore has been doing to fight Voldemort and doesn't like the answer (maybe, preceding is what I'm fuzzy on), and says something about holding DE kids hostage.

Malfoy objects, maybe draws his wand (not sure abt that either) and Harry responds with a blasting curse that takes out the back of his head before turning a wand to Snape.

I just really want to re-read, see Malfoy get what's coming to him.

Edit: found it, chapter 42 of Odd Ideas by Rorschach's Blot.

Turns out Snape is the one who gets his head blown off. It's pretty great.
