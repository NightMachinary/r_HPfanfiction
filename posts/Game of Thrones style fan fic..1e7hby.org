OK. Just been wondering if there's a Game of Thrones style Harry Potter fan fic out there? With different families, lots of blood, sex and politics. Not a Game of Thrones/Hp Crossover... but yeah.

If not... I'll see you in a bit. I'll have some work to do :P


** I haven't seen any that really reminded me of GRRM style. I think the general cutesy-ness of JK Rowlings world and the grittiness of GRRM's world don't necessarily attract the same audience.

By the way, if you haven't read the books themselves, I highly recommend them; even more blood, sex, and politics than they can get away with on HBO. Also, the writing is really good and he switches between characters /every/ chapter, something that is pretty unique in fantasy.

Really? If we took a poll, I'm willing to bet most fans of HP are fans of GoT. I also am willing to bet the main separator is age... HP fans grow to be GoT fans.

**** Well, /now/ that is true, since they've both made the leap to film/TV, where there are still relatively few fantasy options.

However, I read ASoIaF several years before I picked up the HP books (which I thought were 'for children', and as a 9th grader at the time, too immature for me). I had friends who were into epic fantasy like aSoIaF and Wheel of Time, and friends who were into Harry Potter, with very little overlap.

I was pretty turned off by the whimsical nature of magic in HP at first, but JK Rowling is an awesome writer and was thus able to win me over.

***** Have you looked at the fanfic from 10 years ago? I would definitely say that Potter fans were never the type to shy away from sex and blood and intrigue. Maybe the first 11 year-olds were, but the fanbase was never just children.

******* I'm a fan of powerful!Harry fic, so my recs are always skewed that way. There's some really good action and some violence in [[http://jbern.fanficauthors.net/To_Fight_the_Coming_Darkness/index/][To Fight the Coming Darkness]]. It's a story I've read several times and like quite well.

I would also love to read a more GoT sort of Potter fic if anyone here recs one!

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor]] Rated: M Summary: AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE.

The first one or two books probably aren't quite 'Game of Thrones-ish' but they're very good on their own and are necessary to understand the later books which assuredly contain blood, sex and politics (as well as death...) As far as families go, it features the Light and Dark pureblooded families (some new, some not). It's absolutely brilliant!

** Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness trilogy sort of follows this path but not so much in the families area, the sex comes up occaisionally and politics doesn't /really/ hit until the third book.

Be warned, while it's certainly a good read it is unfinished and there hasn't been any sign of the next book in some time.

** There are plenty, the main thing you are looking for is Dark or Grey Harry and possibly a Harry/Many shipping. Many Harem stories go down this path.

I can't think of any with both Violence AND Sex off the top of my head, but I'm certain they exist. Sorry for a non-helpful reply.

*** any of them actually good? I've only tried a few Harry/Many but their plot could be summaraized as "Hermione/Dumbledore/Inheritance Managing Goblins hand over half the world and majority of England's female population to Harry. Voldermort might have been seen once getting drunk in some pub once in between all the orgies.."

If there are any fics from that genre that actually seem like someone with a brain wrote them and even try for ASOIF's power struggles and intrigues I would very much like some recommendations.

*** Heh. Meanwhile, the ASoIaF series is projected to be completed around 2030 or so. Fantastic books, but he's the slowest author I've ever followed.

** Harry Potter and the nightmares of future past has some nice blood on the first few chapter, not so much sex since they are still kids, but some politics thrown here and there.
