I just started reading fanfictions, and I am just wondering if there are any "essentials" that I have to check out. I have Dumbledore's Army and The Year of Darkness marked to read, but are there any others that I have to make sure I read? Thank you so much for your help, and I look forward to seeing your suggestions!

Just about anything on ffn is gold, its a hand selected group of authors. My favorites are Kinsfire and Jaconais.

It really depends on what genre you are looking for as well. Are you looking for post-hogwarts epilogue compatible stuff? Canon Pairings? Year number? Harry/Hermione, Harry/Luna, Harry/Cho, Harry/Many?

If you do not know what you are looking for, and want exposure to a list of ideas I found lirasnape (lists of lists) very helpful when I was first started.

[[http://lira-snape.livejournal.com/5672.html]]

Unfortunately...I only have a few gems that stick in my head (though author names are more readily available), I've read...probably MOST of the het or non-pairing /good/ stuff on the net, so its hard for me to narrow down specifics without more info. I'd be happy to try and help, but I didn't keep a spreadsheet or anything (unfortunately).

*edit: so I've been told I should self plug, as many consider at least one of my stories a classic. But I don't like doing it. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/%7Eginnymylove][http://www.fanfiction.net/~ginnymylove]]*

*** I figured I would probably start with canon pairings, since they are the ones I am most used to at this point. I am not sure about year, anything well written, really. Sorry for not being more specific, I really just don't know. Thank you for your suggestions, though!

*** I second the FanficAuthors.net recommendation, and I suggest Harry Potter and the Last Horcrux by FP, and The Lie I've Lived and Bungle in the Jungle + sequel by JBern.

**** No idea, I'm not really a huge James and Lilly fan, mainly because after reading TLAT it's hard to imagine the two another way. TLAT is more than a Jilly fic, it's extremely broad and well done. An overall great fic by a great author.

*** AHHHHH so I'm halfway through this and it's amazing, and I JUST realized it's not finished...so disappointing! although the author has a tumblr and is active and seems to plan on continuing with the story, so that's a relief. Anyhow, thanks for the awesome rec :)

**** Crow is REALLY REALLY long pacing. But I am interested where it goes.

I am reading [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3655940/26/Harry-Potter-Dark-Memories]]

Harry Potter: Dark Memories is a pretty good book making a Draco friendship believable and a Good!Dumbledore which is hard to find in FanFic
