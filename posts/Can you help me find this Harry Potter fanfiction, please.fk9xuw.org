** I think I remember something like this, but can't remember title or author.

Harry and Tom had the same magical signature? Which is why Harry could impersonate Tom when confronting the witch. And she was behind a series of suspicious deaths from poisonings that stumped Aurors because they couldn't find the magical signature of the potion-maker - because she was a squib or lost her magic somehow. And she was connected to the dead woman Tom almost married. And Remus was married to Tom's adopted daughter, and Severus was also adopted?

I'm pretty sure it was a “through the Veil” story, and Sirius was held prisoner by Unspeakables who wanted to bring Tom down by using the knowledge of the alternate universe (canon) in which Tom was a Dark Lord.

Edit: so either I'm thinking of a different story than you or you're mixing two together, because the one I'm thinking of is longer than 5 chapters and Tom Riddle is a famous healer in need of a vacation, linkffn(a riddled universe)
