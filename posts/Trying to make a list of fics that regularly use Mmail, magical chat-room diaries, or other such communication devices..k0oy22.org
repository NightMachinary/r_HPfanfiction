It's not a very common trope as far as I'm aware, but there's a few stories that are driven partially by some form of magical e-mail or a magical "chat-room" type of thing.

I thought it might be fun to compile a bit of a list of those fics, there's probably more than just the 3 I know - so I'm asking here whether you guys know any of them. Any suggestions will get added to the list below.

- The Original Naked Quidditch Match ( linkffn(3689325) ) makes use of "Mmail" throughout the fic. It's exactly what you expect from the name - a magical equivalent of e-mail. This is the crackiest of crackfics, centering around a Quidditch match that the Gryffindor Team has to play stark naked.
- This Means War ([[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/This_Means_War/index/]]) sporks the same Mmail concept. Also pretty much a crackfic, setting the war against Voldemort in a much lighter tone.
- Becoming Alpha ( linkffn(6389117) ) has Harry and friends using diaries that effectively function as a chatroom.

CONTRIBUTIONS FROM OTHERS:

- Ashes of Chaos has 2-way communication journals come up in second year, one of which is the Diary Horcrux. Doesn't quite get to "chatroom" levels, but it's an honorable mention. linkffn(13507192).
- There's A Meme For That has the Wizarding World using cell phones, and somehow knowing about modern memes. Seems to be an unabashed crackfic, which isn't a Bad Thing™. Drarry pairing, for those who care. linkao3(14523726)
- Swiftly Falling Snow has two-way books, which later get interconnected to a rudimentary chat-room. Fem!Harry fic with a selective-mute protagonist, who gets adopted by Severus Snape. linkao3(25917352)
- The Professors' Point of View gives the Hogwarts professors communication-diaries, and uses them as a medium to show their point-of-view of Harry's six years at Hogwarts. linkffn(7031677)
- Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin has linked-parchment communication. On a personal note, I'm not a fan of the fic - but it counts. linkffn(11191235)
- The Game is about a game of Truth or Dare played between the seventh-year Gryffindors in the Marauders era, using communication parchment. linkffn(7144245)
- Mischief's Heir series. Under threat of breaking the Statute, Wizards (specifically Harry&Co) aspire to go to space. The invention of magical communication is part of the Wizarding Space Program efforts. linkao3(4629198) link to the first "book" in the series.


** The Ashes of Chaos series has glowly journal things, which can be used for remote communication between two participants.

*** Hmm. The only instance I've found in AoC of a "communication" diary/journal is the one that's a Horcrux in canon.

EDIT: Okay, just read further and there's more journals that work roughly the same way (2-way communication) - it's not to "chatroom" levels though.

** The Rachel Snow series has books that are connected to each other that function as a chat room. They only connect two characters in the first fic, but the second fic has five characters communicating regularly through them. They call them “two-way books”.

** This is one of my favorite fics- the world building in incredible, the idea is amazing, no one is too ooc, it's paced well, there a few to no errors, the entire series is FINISHED (wow, that's unusual), however the whole ‘chat' thing is more of a shared journey, though, and it takes a good few chapters to get there, but the journey is totally worth it- don't mind the odd ships in the later parts of the series (Harry stays stag though) they'll make sense in time. Also it's a marvel cross-over, though the ‘marvel' parts of it are somewhat small. It gets a little trop-ish and bad at some parts, but if you power through it, it gets better. The first chapter(s)? (It's been a bit sense I last read it) are rough but it does get better. It's called (Mischief's Heir by mad_fairy) on ao3. Basically, some wizards realize that with modern tech, they're going to get found out soon, and do their best to go to space and live out their lives doing magic as they please.

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.
