Now, after reading a bunch of bellatrix and voldemort fanfics, im starting to hate the main characters lmaoooo. voldemort's bias is brainwashing me and now im getting persuaded that pure blood is the best and dumbledore sucks. Is this only happening to me?


** if your getting brainwashed by shitty fanfics then welp best you avoid any study of history

** Lol what's the rationale behind their logic, anything different from the usual magic passes through blood and muggles suck cos they don't have magic?
