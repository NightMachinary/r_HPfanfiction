** Quite a few of MarauderLover7's stories fit this category (with a focus on James, and the other Marauders, and chapters from his or Sirius' POV). White Flags is longish (100k) while the other stories are 20k or shorter, but still worth a read. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/%7Emarauderlover7][http://www.fanfiction.net/~marauderlover7]]
