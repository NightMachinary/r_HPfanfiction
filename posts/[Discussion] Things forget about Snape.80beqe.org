“[Lily] might even have grown to love him romantically (she certainly loved him as a friend) if he had not loved Dark Magic so much, and been drawn to such loathsome people and acts.” In other words, Snape would have to not be Snape for Lily to love him romantically. Stop with all the Snily stories, people.

“He wanted Lily and he wanted Mulciber too. He never really understood Lily's aversion; he was so blinded by his attraction to the dark side he thought she would find him impressive if he became a real Death Eater.” That kind of thinking is the mark of a psychopath.

“A Patronus is used against things that the Death Eaters generally generate, or fight alongside. They would not need Patronuses.” Snape's capability to produce a Patronus doesn't mean he's a good man. It just means he's the only Death Eater who bothered to learn it.

I'm not denying he's a hero (even if he was blackmailed into it rather than choosing the path of goodness himself) but people need to stop worshiping him.

My own belief is that, as Albus' godfather, Neville would eventually sit him down and tell him what Snape was really like. After that point, Albus would change his middle name to Neville. (Further down the road, he would also go back to insisting people call him Al.)

(Also it was extremely cruel of Harry and Ginny to make Neville the godfather of a boy named Severus.)


** In other words, if Snape had met some obnoxious pureblood Slytherins on the train first, he might have followed Lily into Gryffindor and they could have very well become a couple.

Or if Snape was given a second chance after falling to Nagini, he would certainly do things very differently. Most of the popular Snape/Lily fics are actually of the time travel type, as these authors are aware that Lily would not want a Death Eater Snivellus.

Fanfics are all about exploring alternative scenarios. Where is the fun if everything sticks to canon?

No, that kind of thinking is the mark of a lower-class boy joining a gang; the gang represents acceptance, dignity, power and in some cases an income.

I'm not an apologist for Snape, but don't think that he was inhuman for the choices he made. They were very human choices.

My own belief is, that after Snape is resurrected from the Dead, he kidnaps Albus, changes his name to Tom Marvolo and raises him as a carbon copy of the Dark Lord.

Sorry, couldn't resist. I agree with your opinion on Snape, but if you just want to make stuff up (which is fine, I reject the epilogue entirely) why not imagine that he isn't called Albus Severus in the first place (because that's a stupid name). More believable than Albus insulting his parents and rejecting his given name.

*** Snape might have bailed Neville and Ginny out of multiple tight spots in Year 7, at considerable risk to himself.

If that were the case, then both Neville and Ginny would have very good reasons to forgive him.

I've been always saying that ignoring Hogwarts during Year 7 was one huge mistake by Rowling. Lots of what happened in Epilogue would suddenly make lot of sense.

**** Unfortunately, a lot of stuff was left out and so we only have conjecture. As it was left, though, Snape is irredeemable, which is why I (and many other people) will continue to say that Severus is a horrible name.

****** Snape is like ice cream with sprinkles. The sprinkles symbolize "good" and the ice cream is "bad". When you take a bite, you feel the crunch of the sprinkles, but quickly dismiss it because it's basically flavorless. All that's left is the ice cream, or "bad." His work was brave, yes, but it didn't redeem him.

Also I will never get over the significance of "Always." /shudders/

******* ...that analogy only applies relative to you, considering the actual narrative prioritises the taste of the sprinkles over the ice-cream, and the sprinkles are infinitely more significant than the ice cream. it's more like snape is an ice cream with caramel mixed in throughout, with a bed of caramel resting at the bottom. the caramel being the good, and the ice cream being the bad. while you're eating it, it's mostly plain ice cream, occasionally with bites of caramel, until eventually the caramel is the last thing you eat and then you name your child after it

******** Then the caramel, being too sweet, sickens you and you regret that last bite, just as you would later regret naming your son after a controlling/abusive/bullying/prejudiced/Nazi-type man. You take a swig of water to wash out the taste, or, to continue the analogy, seek therapy.

And who names their son Caramel? Only an idiot.

*** I don't think it'd be an insult to change his name. People do it all the time (whether because of a change in gender or they just don't like it).

Also I think this was intended to be after the events of CC, since it refers to him going back to Al, and thereby accepting canon (despite the atrocity it became).

It's DEFINITELY cruel of Harry and Ginny to do that to Neville though... That was what /really/ disgusted me.

Sure if your name is meaningless you do. If you're named after a War Hero that - for some inexplicable reason - your parents hold in high regard then it is certainly insulting. I'd feel insulted (though I wouldn't burden my child with that name anyway; I just imagine someone more deserving).

Imagine you named your kid after your dad and kid comes to you "Yo LoverofLogic, my friend XY talked to me and told me that your dad was a huge dick. So I'm going to change my name. Kthxbye!"

***** I think he keeps Albus though, just goes by Al and changes Severus. Dumbledore was highly respected but I doubt anybody but Harry liked Snape. Personally, if my child could explain their reasoning, I wouldn't feel insulted.

Alright, you seem to have edited your response... And it doesn't make sense. That wouldn't be the same situation at all if Albus changed his name from Severus.
