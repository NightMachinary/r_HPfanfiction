The plot is fine, the characterizations okay, and there are interesting bits that expound on the original and excite you. Sounds fun?

Except when it */isn't/*.

It used to be that most fics in this criteria would of decent quality, assuring you of satisfactory entertainment for a good weekend or so.

Now, you have stories that start off with a massive AU- /Harry Crow, I am looking at you/- which seem to be befitting of their high-ranking status and 25,086 reviews, vaguely pedophilic cover image or no. You get to read about charming goblin traditions and adorable reactions, and before the next chapter begins- you have Hermione Granger falling for somebody if quote, "Fitzwilliam Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet ever had a son". Then before you know it, Harry is summoning the Elder Wand from Dumbledore's hand.

But I'm not here to expound upon the qualities, or lack thereof, present in that fic. There is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3cgps9/how_is_the_hell_is_harry_crow_so_popular/][another discussion]] devoted to that topic, after all.

No, the type of derivative literature ranted about here today is far more insidious, causing irreparable damage to be wrought upon reader's psyches, imprinting certain mental images on their very souls...

Of course, I'm talking about [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1024910/12/Hinge-of-Fate][Hinge of Fate]] here. The woefully inadequate summary is as follows: /Hermione cannot remember, and Severus cannot forget./

Neither can I erase the horror that is this story from my memory.

For the more +adventurous+ suicide-inclined, I hereby sum up the plot. After all, most know that stories in which a certain greasy Potions Master is referred to by his given name have a highly limited appeal.

Basically, you have reviews like "Awww, rape is so ROMANTIC!111!"

A Death Eater whose loyalty is in question. A kidnapped uppity Muggleborn Head Girl. A chance to humiliate them both, not to mention support a certain pairing...

We all know where this is going, don't we.

I did enjoy reading it though, the way passengers riding in one of those ghost trains in amusement park enjoyed themselves. Screaming [internally] all the way, while clutching at the screen with a white-knuckled grip.

Read it, and rant.

Cheers!


** I got a real kick out of your post. May your mental scars fade. Even as a person who's read a fair amount of Hermione/Snape. What can I say, except different folks, different strokes.

That being said Hinge of Fate is atrocious. Oh my stars, I hate it. By some wonderful miracle of luck I thankfully did not read it as a teenager. Only very recently have I come back to the fanfiction scene, and then I found this motherfucker. I couldn't. I haven't gotten past chapter 4 or 5 it hurt so much to wrap my head around this fic. The inexplicable choice at the beginning, the casual conversation with your memory erased rapist about apparition lessons. The complete massacre of Dumbledore as a character in the first two chapters.

I take away from all this: You can't control what people write. You can only rant online and entertain kindred spirits.

But besides that, deciding on whether or not to have an abortion is a very personal choice, and it isn't just a rational one. Sometimes, even when a woman is pro choice, and she thinks it would be better, she still just can't do it.

** Honestly, I can almost a forgive a story for being complete shite if it clearly only exists for the sole reason of promoting the author's OTP. That happens a lot with fanfiction, authors and readers get so wrapped up in the cuteness and romance of the fic and then completely forget that everything else about it is complete crap.

I think we all know by now that Harmony shippers(at least a large portion of them) are the most infamous when it comes to stuff like this, but I always find the reviews to be much more interesting than the stories. I mean, when you have a story about Harry and Hermione being psychopaths who brain damage Ron into oblivion and come out on top, then see a review that claims how in character everyone is, you raise an eyebrow so hard, that it busts out of your head and into space.

I think the main reason behind it is people get so caught up in fanfiction that they forget all the details in canon, because you don't get a vibe that anyone knows what they are talking about, especially in fanfiction profiles. How many false Draco tropes do we have by now? Draco in leather pants, Draco the Slytherin sex God, Draco the extremely intelligent, Draco and the rough and abusive childhood, Draco who totes had feelings for Hermione throughout every book 4 realsies. Pretty much everything that keeps the Dramione express going.

I've come to realise that making sense out of it doesn't really work though. I once wrote a fic taking the piss out the awful portion of Harmony shippers, debunking every problem with their beliefs and still got a review or two that was basically a copy and paste of one of their fanfic profiles.

** I automatically dislike any Hermione pairing that's been justified using any iteration of the line 'they're intellectual equals'. (And btw, Voldemort/Riddle and Hermione aren't magical equals, he *far* outstrips her. Draco is closer, but I think there's more evidence that she's more intelligent. Severus is the closest, but I'd argue he's more creative/intellectually motivated whereas Hermione is more principle oriented.) I *loathe* professor/student and the general vibe of Sevmione.

** Something else that's always funny to me is that most Sevmione writers would obviously be fans of him. Which means, you likely think he has at least some moral dimension. But, like. How can you portray that by having him fuck his young female students. The skeeviest professor clich√© ever. Hasn't he done enough already?

** Bound to You is another super squicky Severus/Hermione. And I'm actually a fan of Severus/Hermione only not while Hermione's a student. Never ever ever while Hermione's a student. Bound to you is another one that's basically "rape is so romantic" except in this case it's "repeated rape is so romantic".

Also the number of unintended pregnancies in Severus/Hermione fanfiction drives me up the wall. Any fic where Hermione gets pregnant and after a short period of deciding what to do decides to keep it despite that screwing up all her life goals is a fic I immediately abandon. The exception is Sin & Vice, which is a Severus/Hermione that gets rid of pretty much all the elements that non-shippers seem to find squicky

*** I'm actually reading Sin & Vice right now and I'm finding it very well written considering a lot of what's out there for this ship. Pretty much all the major issues with this ship have been addressed, the characterization works given the plot events, my only issue is Snape's characterization. But I'm only at chapter 20 so we'll certainly see.

** I have never read reviews saying rape was romantic (thankfully). However, in stories with this theme, it is important to note the man didn't want to do it either but had no real choice. I don't think it's a healthy basis for a relationship, but the premise is that they're both traumatized by the same event.

I read stories with this theme more for the hurt/comfort aspect of it than the romance. Some of them don't even have a romance plot in there, just Angst/Hurt/Comfort.

** Wow, I didn't expect this kind of response to my first post, thanks guys! Having so many others echo the same sentiments does wonders for a battered morale.

That said, this is probably what the author thought after reading reviews for the infamous chapter 14: /"I aimed for the fandom's heart, and by accident I hit it in the libido."/

Honestly. The warning was as follows: /"The following chapter includes a graphic description of violence. It is not meant to be titillating in ANY way, or to romanticize this kind of violence. It is, however, meant to relay a sense of sacrifice and courage under fire."/

Indeed, I was overwhelmed with a sense of sacrificed honor and congratulated myself for courageously surviving the fic.

If you swapped a typical harem fic and this one, it would be mistaken for actual smut. Down to the capitalization of the word "nature" a la certain porn sites.

** I've been saving up a rant for something like this. Who the FUCK thinks that Hermione/Severus or Severus/Potter or any fucking student teacher shit is a good pairing?! Seriously, it's creepy as fuck in so many ways AND it's rape in at least 2. Even the Hogwarts x Giant Squid is more romantic than the bullshit those stories shovel AND it's more original in it's plot than the stories that seem to go about as far as "hey, I watched some porn with this plot, gimme a second to pull my pants and grab some tissues down before I start writing." I mean goddamn, the writers for that stuff either have as many issues as Perfect Lionheart or are laughing their asses off that the creepyass basement dwellers lurking around dropping reviews taking things too seriously.

Edut: And that's not even getting started on the writing, seriously, you read most of these fics and you'd think they were typing with their dick. Come to think of it, considering the content of the shit you're talking about they probably are. Oh, and If I see another fic that talks about fucking tongue wrestling I think I might end up killing someone.

Edit 2: AND FUCK MARY SUE BULLSHIT. I want a good story with an interesting narrator that brings two universes together, not one that has 11 year old Harry fucking Potter dueling Dumbledore to a standstill, resurrecting Tom's diary as an inferii thing to interrogate it, while eveyone's constantly harping on about how talented the conceited little fucker is. Seriously, I wanted a good crossover between the Fate universe and the Harry Potter one. I saw Fate's Gamble and I figured, Hey, It's got a lot of fans. It can't be that bad, right? WRONG MOTHER FUCKER! Looking on the bright side, I did end up finding a good crossover (phenominal acutally) in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9340220/1/Crosswinds-of-Fate][Crosswinds of Fate]], where nobody's pulling Bullshit out of their ass fast enough to solve world hunger.
