:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Pretty sure the Hocrux leaves Harrys body when he is turned causing him to keep his own soul. And for him to be a special type of vampire.

He also while a sleep visit James,Lily and Sirus in the afterlife and he and his girlfriend learn necromancy from a pair of twins that lived hundreds of years ago?

Pretty sure he also goes to a quiddich game while visiting he afterlife and Godric Gryffindor is on one of the teams.

Pretty sure the female vampire panics a bit when she finds out she turned Harry Potter.

Edit: pretty sure that she turns Harry over a few days with him willing meeting her at the park each night and inviting her into the house.

Also pretty sure it's a fic from before twilight was a thing.

Edit2: I though it was by The Santi but its not on their fanfiction.net page.

Edit3:found it, it was Harry Potter and the Vampire's Kiss by The Santi but its has been deleted from their current profile found it on wayback machine.
