It seems pretty intuitive to say that a wizard will get out of practice at casting spells if they go a long period of time without challenging themselves, or without using magic at all.

I'm just trying to remember if the series ever shows that to be definitively true. Dumbledore doesn't do great magic on a day to day basis, but he maintains his position as top dog. Voldemort was literally just a wraith for a decade, but when he came back nobody seemed to think that he was less powerful than he was before. The Death Eaters that had been in Azkaban seemed to still be highly threatening. Etc.

So yeah, are there any examples of someone's skill deteriorating due to disuse?


** Lockhart. He's only good at one or two spells; Obliviate, and presumably cosmetic charms. It's not that he's actually a total incompetent, it's that being essentially a celebrity journalist, he wasn't using many spells. Pottermore's tale has him fairly clever in school, and gifted enough that his teachers thought they had misjudged his character when they heard of his brave deeds. They didn't think "oh he was useless, he must be a fraud", they thought "oh he's braver and more daring than we thought, he must've matured a lot".

Granted, he was written in a very cartoonish, Roald-Dahl-villain-ish way in the second book, but if you account for that, he was a poser who was constantly trying to show of his skills, only to find he'd lost them. I think of him like a dad trying to show off his skateboarding skills to his kids only to find his knees don't work that way any more. I'm certain Gilderoy once /could/ mend a simple broken bone, or at least splint it magically. And he was certainly gifted in potions, given that he invented his own hair product.

** If you look at the escaped Death Eaters and Sirius after Azkaban, I'd say there's canon proof it /does not/. Bella remains Voldemort's most feared fighter, Dolohov an accomplished duellist, and Sirius we see conjure manacles from thin air with a wand that was not his own (likely his first magic in twelve years, and if not, then he was performing wandless magic and that's even more an argument skill doesn't deteriorate).

You can look at those same three as canon proof that magic can be altered by your mindset/mood, however (i.e. no magic possible in Azkaban because a wizard is "drained" of powers and Bellatrix's skill at Crucio).

** Even if there wasn't proof why would it not? You yourself say it seems pretty intuitive. Any skill, magical or mundane would deteriorate without consistent use or practice. If I learn a language, and then don't use it for years, the likelihood of me being as good as I was right after learning it is almost non-existent. Only those with perfect recall would likely be able to and even then it might take them a bit to brush off the cobwebs if you will.

That said, yes within canon there were several "possible" examples. Someone already mentioned Merope, but another is Sirius, who when he got out of Azkaban, is out of practice. As for Voldemort, keep in mind while he was powerful, he commands a lot of respect through simple fear and reputation. He may very well have been out of practice but how much practice do you really need when you have the dark mark, crucio, and fear/intimidation on your side.

*** Why not isn't good enough. Intuitive doesn't mean it's true, I want to see if it's actually proven.

Merope seemed to be more of a state of mind thing, IIRC. She basically immediately lost what little ability she had, she didn't get rusty over time.

Can you reference a particular moment for Sirius, or cite it?

For Voldemort, surely someone like Moody or Dumbledore or one of the more ambitious Death Eaters would think, hmm, this guy hasn't cast so much as a levitation spell in a decade. Then I'm pretty sure we actually see him doing crazy shit when he dueled Dumbledore. Voldemort was not treated as diminished by anybody.

***** Really? Magic must work the same way as mundane skills? C'mon.

  Otherwise kids would just be told and shown things once and boom, they are set for life.

I mean, that sort of seems to be the case, they just have to practice to reach an acceptable level of competency. They have to train it up. They learn how to cast as spell, but they suck at it. Practice, cast it faster, stronger, etc. Now that single spell is done, time to move on. Students go to Hogwarts, finish their education, then for most of them that's it for the rest of their lives.

 

Either way, I made this discussion looking for /proof/.

** I think the position is basically that it can happen but it does not always happen. Lockhart was an ok student who lost a lot of his skills. On the other hand, Voldemort spent 13 years without a body and he resumed using magic as if it had never happened.

Would an amateur musician really be able to tell the difference between "Mozart" and "slightly worse than Mozart"?

** There was some proof with Merope, Tom Riddle's mom. She basically lost hope after Riddle Snr left her, and could barely cast anything.
