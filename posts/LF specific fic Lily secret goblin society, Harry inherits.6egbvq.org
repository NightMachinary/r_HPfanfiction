Hi,

I had this particular fic open in my browser at one point, but I seem to have lost it it was a pretty interesting concept where Lily was part of some ancient society/alliance between wizards and goblins with the purpose of basically evacuating victimized muggleborns and stuff.

It was a fairly militaristic organization with a rank structure and formalized training. Harry basically inherits command of this society after Lily's death.

In the beginning of the story we learn that Lily only had a few options for men to marry: James potter, Arthur weasely, or possibly frank longbottom.

We find out that James was a total asshole and Lily hated him, but settled on marrying him in order to conceive a child. Upon Harry's birth, Lily immediately cuts James off, however they reconcile later and Lily learns to love James.

This is all the detail I can remember about this fic. If anyone knows what I'm talking about, I would greatly appreciate the title or a link.


** It sounds intriguing so I had a search on the Archive of Our Own. I came across this which vaguely fits your description: [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/10111904/chapters/22511639]]
