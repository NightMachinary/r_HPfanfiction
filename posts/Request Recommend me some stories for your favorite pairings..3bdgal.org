So I've run out of reading material, and finding good HP fanfiction is getting a bit difficult now that I've already read most of the obvious ones. So here I am, coming to request some stories from the good old HPfanfiction community.

So, I've always been a sucker for well written stories where the main character saves the day and gets the girl. I like feel-good stories, but sadly a lot of those that I come across seem pretty badly written. (I feel like good depressing/tragic stories are much easier to write than happy stories). I'd be down for any stories you want to suggest, but I'd like to see more of some less explored characters. It'd be a nice change of pace.

Here are some guidelines that I would like the stories to follow. Though really I'm just a fan of good writing. If something breaks one of the points on my list but is still really good, feel free to suggest it anyways.

- The story should be complete. I really, really, really hate reading a story that I enjoy and then discovering that there are no more chapters and the author has gone missing. I generally read my stories in one go, and even if the author is still active I will forget about the story and then not want to pick it up again later. So I'd really like them to be finished.
- There should be some sort of pairing. Though the story does not have to be totally romance. I like things to happen as well, and stories that are too focused on romance generally have the problem where they suffer from a lack of things happening.
- I'd like the story to be long. I'm not too big of a fan of one-shots. I like enough time for things to develop and for me to become invested in the story/characters.
- I'm not a fan of slash. Sorry.
- I generally don't like pairings featuring Draco/Snape. Stories that try to pair Draco up generally tend to suffer from massive "Draco in Leather Pants" syndrome, from what I've seen. And Snape's problem is that he's such a well written character in the regular books. I feel that most authors don't do him justice, and that pairing him off tends to diminish the impact that his character brings.
- I like my stories to have plot that actually takes time to develop, and is reasonably believable. Sure, I can accept a magical hairpin that causes people to time travel. I can suspend my disbelief and accept that Harry magically has a portion of his father's consciousness. But everything beyond that should develop somewhat naturally. I don't want to see "and suddenly Harry as all of these powers and shows everybody who is boss and is magical and awesome". (Examples taken from stories that I have read and more or less enjoyed.)
- I'm generally not a fan of OCs as main characters. Supporting OCs are generally perfectly acceptable. Especially if your story trails off into an alternate setting/time/whatever, where there are not already very many established characters and you have to make up your own. But most of the stories I've attempted to read where one of the main characters was an OC end up horrible. I can probably count the number of "OC is the main character" stories that I've read and enjoyed on one hand.


** Did you read DrizzleWizzle's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8666085/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Slytherin-Selection][series]]? Its ongoing, but it has a strict uploading schedule and there's a lot of it out there. The pairing isn't exactly set, but there's romance to go around. Very good Slytherin!Harry that avoids most of the common pitfalls. Like They Shook Hands, but better.

I'm sure you've already read HPMoR; the pairing fell rather flat either way. I'd also recommend Harry Potter and the Natural 20, but it isn't finished and updates have started to slow down. I also think the author forgot that Harry and co actually exists, so that is pretty meh.

Santi's Boy Who Lived is great, if you missed it. Certainly a bad ass main character and its starting to get into the pairing, but updates are slow and it isn't finished either. A recurring theme with good stories, isn't it?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense][This]] is really good, but its slow going, there isn't a pairing yet, and Harry is female. Doesn't fit your request very well, but its a bit of a hidden gem that's quite good that wouldn't do to let any others lurking the thread miss!

Harry Potter and the Halfblood Auror.. Right, I liked that one, and it fit pretty well, but.. I was going to say it's been half a year since its updated, but apparently its been two years. Time flies, I guess. So you can count that as abandoned, which is sad. Was a fun story, though.

Lopie's series is finished, rather long, Harry is quite bad-ass and gets the girl, but it hasn't really held up too well from 2006. If you are desperate, I suppose it will do. There's much better stuff floating around these days though, I just can't find any because I'm pants at remembering to favorite stories.

Make a Wish, Havoc Side of the Force, Circular Reasoning, Sitra Ahra, The Next Great Adventure, The One He Feared, Alexandra Potter and Alexandra Quick are all not fitting of the request, but I thought I'd just leave them here in case anyone is so dried out of fics to read they'll take anything and maybe discovers some new tastes. They are all pretty good.

Favorite pairing is rather hard. HHr and Harry/Tonks very often ends up rather.. shitty, for the lack of a better word.

Hogwarts Strike Team is pretty okay HHr, for what it is. Three To Backstep is a bit of a guilty pleasure, seeing as its soaking in cliches. Still rather fun. I mentioned some Harry/Tonks above, and there isn't too much else. Its a hard pairing and not a too popular one, but I like it. You could check out Halfblood Auror, if you wanted, if you don't mind an unfinished probably abandoned story. Lopie's Harry/Tonks series is a bit.. underwhelming, but its finished and gets the job done for passing time.

I suppose I enjoy Harry/Fleur a bit also, which has [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/3/][The Lie I've Lived]] which you've probably read already, and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][The Wasteland's of Time]] too.

*** A lot of those I've either read or checked out before. And I do have to agree that the biggest problem is that the most promising stories all seem to be unfinished.

Of the things that you've recommended, I definitely enjoyed the Alexandra Quick series the most. Natural 20 also started off really good, but the updates have definitely been slowing down drastically. (Lie I've Lived and Wastelands of Time were also both pretty good.)

I think I'll check out "The Pureblood Pretense" if there aren't any better recommendations for me to read first. Afterwards, I might take a look at Lopie's stuff.

*** Hey, just letting you know that I've finished the Pureblood Pretense and it was quite wonderful. Thank's for the suggestion, as I probably never would have found it otherwise.

I'm going to get started on the next one, though I suspect that I will have to wait a long time before the third is finished, which is kind of disappointing.

** linkffn(Time Heals All Wounds by brightsilverkitty). This turned me on to the Bellamione pairing, and there hasn't been another fic I've read that's able to do justice to that pairing. It's amazing.

linkffn(Shadow Walks) is a great Harmony fic. I don't /usually/ go in for Harmony, but this deals with it in such a fantastic way.

You said you don't like OCs. Have you read the Alexandra Quick series? It's probably the one OC-dominated series that is worth anyone's time.

** So my favorite pairing is Draco/Ginny, which is a bit of an acquired taste. But I love and still reread these stories, so I will share my love.

She's changing and no one seems to realize it. Pretty angsty, rated for seriousness of content. Some G/H more G/D.
