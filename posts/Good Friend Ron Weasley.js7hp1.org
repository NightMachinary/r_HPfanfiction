  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  No one can deny that the Senju brothers are very close. Madara never expected to find himself wondering just . . . how close. He'd really rather not be now, if only he could shut the thoughts out. (Series: Brothers, story #2)

** Powerful Magical Artifact by Kathryn518/Plums: dimensional travel. There's only one chapter, but it's absolutely brilliant. Don't remember any pairing. linkffn(13224282)

Who Dares Wins by OlegGunnarsson. Still in progress but latest update was last week so definitely not abandoned. Harry/Susan linkffn(13182638)

  The Goblet of Fire is a powerful magical artifact. Powerful enough to lock four powerful magicals to a binding magical contract even when one is unwilling. What else can it do to fulfill a contract? Pull someone to fulfill a contract from a distance? Reach across space and time? Summon the dead?

  A Harry Potter who grew up studying military tactics and strategy uses the attack on the Ministry as an opportunity to lay an ambush of his own - only to learn that his parents are still alive, as well as a twin brother whom Dumbledore calls the true boy-who-lived. And then, things get complicated. Military!Harry. A subversion of DZ2's Prodigal Son Challenge.
