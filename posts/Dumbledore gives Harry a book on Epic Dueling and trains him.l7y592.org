I remember reading a fic a while ago where like the title says, Dumbledore gives Harry a book on epic dueling (pretty sure it was literally called epic dueling) and trains him. I don't really remember the rest of the plot other than the fact that Albus takes him on as a protege.


** "Here Harry, start with this. We will need it in our next meeting." Said the headmaster as he handed him a yellow book.

Harry read the title, "Epic Dueling for Dummies?" He asked.

"A classic. You can't go wrong with that masterful approach to teaching."

"Err... okay"

** Yes! I've been looking for this fic for literal years! Iirc it has notes in it by Grindelwald. He also dresses like Dumbledore too.
