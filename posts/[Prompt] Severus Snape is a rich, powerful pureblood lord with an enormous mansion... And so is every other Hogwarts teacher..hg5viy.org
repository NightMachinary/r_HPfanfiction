This includes Rubeus Hagrid.


** Well that explains all the Bigfoot sightings in the Galloway Forest then. It was just Hagrid going home for the weekend

** But it's impossible for Hagrid to be a pureblood by definition.

Quite a few pre-HBP fics have Snape as a rich pureblood lord, from what I recall.

*** It's a parody of the 'rich pureblood Snape' fics. As for Hagrid - it's an AU. Maybe their definition of 'pureblood' includes people with non-human heritage, as long as they don't have muggles in their immediate family (Veela!Malfoy fanfics anyone?). Maybe it doesn't, but nobody dares to accuse someone as rich and influential and politically powerful as Lord Hagrid of faking his blood status. Or maybe this Hagrid just has really big bones and isn't half-giant at all. What matters is that Hagrid's hut is a fifty-bedroom mansion awkwardly towering over Hogwarts and Draco Malfoy has to adress him as Lord Hagrid while cleaning up after Blast-ended Skrewts for the CoMC lessons. Having literal nobility work at a public school doesn't make a lot of sense, but it's fun to imagine.

**** Imagine Hagrid having a higher rank than Lucius Malfoy and using it to bankrupt him after getting falsely sent to Azkaban
