I feel like I'm missing some fun fics because I just can't sort and filter. Any gems?

(Personally, I only read (Hermione + Neither Harry nor Ron) fics. I like a wide range of fics from heavy to crackish, as long as they are written with some care.)


** I know they didn't mean badly by doing it, but gosh darn everyone who posted a picture of gems feels just feels slightly dickish to me.

I know there's no rules against it on the subreddit, but it still pisses me off.

That said, I got you covered OP:

[[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600097534]] -Pansy/Hermione dom story.

[[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600022241]] -Harry/Heinrich Himmler, sort of?

[[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600017198]] -Non sexual, goofy story.

There are quite a few good fics for people with certain tastes, but I don't have those kinds of tastes, and I don't wish to be banned from Reddit for posting those fics.

**** Someone posted pictures of gems, other people thought it would be funny to do the same, and of course they all got downvoted as a result of not adding to the discussion. You ever hear of the "Tom Cruise" askreddit thread? Kind of similar, only that subreddit is very open to that kind of humor.

** [[http://grangerenchanted.com/enchant/viewstory.php?sid=1819][/Dangerous/ by Black Lotus]]: After ten years of self-imposed exile, Harry Potter heads home to a wizarding Britain once again embroiled in civil war. Except this time, the Ministry is claiming that the new Dark power is Hermione Granger.

- It /is/ Harry/Hermione, but not shippy about it. (Thank you, [[/u/Taure]], for introducing me to that term.)
- Is probably abandoned (last update 2010); what's there is interesting and well-writen.
- Powerful!Hermione; Harry too, but unclear to what extent.
