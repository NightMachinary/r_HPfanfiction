Of course, the fic has to be well-written.

I'm talking about a Daphne Greengrass, while still cunning, ambitious and resourceful, is the absolute life of the party and loves a laugh (whether from pranks or jokes). A Daphne who would eagerly - with anti-hangover and sobering potions ready for afterwards - accept a drinking challenge and probably win, followed by a belching contest. What about maybe a version of the character who sneaks to Muggle London in her spare time, either to breakdance on the streets or simply enjoys busking (or both)?

She is still cautious of individuals and always planning her next move, this Daphne does so with a smile/grin on her face and bubbly demeanour. How would you feel about this version (or versions) of Daphne Greengrass?


** I think it could be funny and interesting if well written. Hell I remember a fic where Daphne was trying her best to show a pureblood facade but had problem with swearing to the point her parents made spell at home that rang when she cursed. It's not something you would expect but I fond it quite funny.

** I'd like to read more purebloods who aren't either biggots or belittle them like Arthur Weasley. Hell, my headcanon for Bellatrix Lestrange is that she used to sneak out from Hogwarts to get pissed in some Muggle nightclub and smuggle a few bottles of Vodka back in without declaring her undying love for all things Muggle (at least before Andromeda eloped).

Now imagine that Daphne had a secret relationship with Hermione and most of Hermione's odd behavior came from her frustration that she couldn't just openly devour her girlfriend like Ron was doing. They began meeting in secrecy before the OWLS and then had a summer romance, with Hermione's parents shaking their heads about the whole thing because they didn't know about the whole pureblood supremacy but simply thought that the whole thing was utterly adorable.

** I direct you to my flair.

In more seriousness, I'm not a fan of "ice queen" Daphne, mainly because I think that characterisation does not fit with children well. Perhaps it could be a good characterisation for an adult Daphne, but I don't like the trope of super political teenagers or Slytherin house being some kind of cult.

The stance I take is that they're just normal children like the rest of Hogwarts, and behave as such. Of course, they are children with a certain upbringing, so will display certain unconscious biases, but there should be (at least in the first few years of Hogwarts) something quite innocent about it.

With this in mind, "ice Queen Slytherin girl" doesn't quite fit with my vision for Slytherin house, in so far as it refers to someone who constantly comports themselves according to correct etiquette, who conceals their feelings, behaves very formally, and has their entire life and behaviour oriented around some political stance.

Another thing I dislike about it is that it presents "correct pureblood behaviour" as quite one dimensional, with the "ice queen" being the extreme end of a linear scale - "maximum pureblood". I think this displays a lack of familiarity with real life upper class people.

In Victoria Potter, which features the Slytherin girls heavily (being a fem!Harry in Slytherin), I am attempting to use Pansy and Daphne as a kind of case study in how there can be multiple dimensions within "correct upper class behaviour".

Pansy represents the "metropolitan upper class". She's into fashion and carefully selects her outfits. She's not especially bright but she values academic performance and works hard because it's expected by her parents. She likes things neat and ordered and done according to rules, everything in its correct place (with her, naturally, at the top). She prefers controlled environments and dislikes the mess of the outdoors. She's aware of her privilege and enjoys it.

Daphne, meanwhile, represents the "rural upper class". She dresses well, but with a certain informal effortlessness rather than careful coordination. Practical, outdoor pursuits are valued as highly as academic success, and she enjoys adventures through bogs and forests. She has a happy-go-lucky approach to life and enjoys spontaneity. She considers herself "normal" and is unappreciative of the gilded life she leads.

(Note that I use the terms "urban/rural" as useful labels for their characteristics, not literal descriptions. In the literal sense, they're both rural upper class, in that they both live with a large amount of land, outside of urban areas.)

Each of these girls is based on girls I went to school with: on the one hand, the "fashion show" type who was big into music and drama, who tended to be the children of upper-middle class parents like lawyers and doctors; on the other hand, the "horse girl" type, more into sports and parties, who tended to be the children of genuine upper-class people (i.e. farmers).

** Pranks are overdone, in my opinion, and almost never pass the "would you find it funny if it happened to you?" test (and if they fail the test,m they aren't pranks in my opinion).

I'd prefer a Ditz Daphne to a cunning yet playful, party-loving ambitious and genius pranking Daphne. Or a Daphne that's the life of the party, and average otherwise. Maybe even shallow - leave some room for character growth in the story.

Or a Daphne with a secret fascination for muggle culture, and that's it - she focuses on acquiring muggle stuff and indulging in trips to muggle Britain, and that takes every bit of cunning and resources she can muster, meaning she's not the Slytherin queen and budding politician as well.

** I wish people would stop writing twin-speak.

I have stopped reading most fanfictions that feature twin speak.

Its annoying. Its out of character and the reference to that one time the twins completed each other sentences, is completely out of proportion.

Whats good about Daphne as a female character is, that she barely has any form in canon. You can develope her as you want her to be.

** I'm ambivalent about it. I guess I kind of enjoy the trope as it is now. You /could/ make her that way, but I feel like it's redundant because the niche is already filled by the Weasley twins. Shoot, if you really need slytherin pranksters, you could have symmetry with the Carrow twins.

It /could/ be good, but you'd need to flesh it out more before I'd be on board.

** This sub really punishes anyone who criticizes Weasley Twins but I will say anyway: I hate Weasley Twins. And I won't like a pranking Daphne. It will inevitably involve Weasley Twins and I will get triggered and close the tab.

It's not about hating fun loving people, it's more about people advocating bullying disguised in fun and pranks. Often Weasley loving author project their hate of 11-17 year old Hogwarts students (usually Draco) and use Weasely to 'prank' them viciously, laughing at misery, pain and embarrassment.

That's my personal opinion though, and I know it's quite unpopular here. People love those twins, and often downvote anyone who hints their hatred for 'pranks'.

Anyway, it's possible to write a fun loving but non-pranking Daphne without turning her into bully. I will love that kind of Daphne. In my mind Daphne isn't iceQueen anyway. No slytherin, in their right mind, will be so, without paying the price. Socially competent people don't go around with 'blank face, cold mask', and slytherin are masters of cunning and resourceful connections, if nothing else.

*** And that is absolutely fine! If I were to be honest, I don't like how a lot of people characterise the twins in fanfic.

Generally, writers take it too far with trying to write the Twins as "fun" and "quirky", like that one guy/prick who justified their bullying as "banter". In canon, the Twins are a lot less insufferable.

I don't necessarily mean a pranking Daphne that is a carbon copy of the Twins, but rather a version of the character who is the farthest thing from an Ice Queen.

**** There's a similar-ish Daphne to what you propose from one of the 8th year fics, where her "nickname" is "I don't date-Daphne" where she'll do a bunch of fun things with the group, drink, fool around with her friends, make out with someone if she wants, but just not have a serious relationship.

I don't remember the name of the fic, I just remember it being a 8th year, with a common room for them instead of their house, so there's a lot of interactions. I remember Ron being paired with a Ravenclaw, Dramione, Harry/Daph, I think Blaise and Ginny. I also remember Augusta Longbottom being killed post war and they begin to investigate.

*** My way with the Twins (and Marauders, if I need to make them likeable) is to have them only prank other pranksters. No malice in it; just an ongoing game between two sides who each love to prank the other but appreciate pranks directed /at/ them in good humor.
