Fics that make your brain come to a screeching halt as it realizes something that was there /all along/ but you never noticed, or just brain-twisting fics in general (like a fic-version of Inception).

These usually tend to be action/adventure/mystery, perhaps with some drama.


** For a brain-twisting mystery with large helping of slowly building horror read linkffn(Elizium for the Sleepless Souls by Voice of the Nephilim)

  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.

** Oh shit! Tusing, you're a DLPer, right? I started writing a story with a bit of mind twisting time-travel, but I haven't ever posted it anywhere since there isn't much of it.

The premise is that Harry, who lives in a bleak future without hope and needs to go back in time to change everything, realises that /changing things/ via time travel is impossible. And as such, the only way to alter the past is if the future never happened at all. The only way to do that? He just needs to /think/ that it happened all along.

As you can tell, it's certainly brain-twisting. It's been quite hard to write so far to keep it all consistent which is why there's not much of it. PM me if you're interested and I'll send you the documents?
