Looking for specific fanfics 1) Post war (already read The Last Day, Grave Days, Inner demons)

2)Lily and/or James come back (already read Blood Binding and Together Again)

3) Sirius doesn't die or comes back to life

4) Everyone who died from the war comes back

Please provide recommendations for all! I would really appreciate it Thanks

  "Lily, it's him! Take Harry and run!" It began the same way, but ended in a very different way. This change caused life instead of death for many. Life altering changes provide the Power The Dark Lord Knows Not. J/L, H/Hr
