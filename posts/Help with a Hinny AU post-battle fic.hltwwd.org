:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read a fic on FF where Harry and Ginny meet for the very first time during the final battle. They then spend some time at a beach house with Sirius as both himself and Padfoot. Molly is against them being together because of a prophecy. They then travel the world together. Any help would be appreciated.
