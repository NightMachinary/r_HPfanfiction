I've been reading through the Harry Potter Wikia and have found a ton of interesting stuff from long dead characters. For example, Phineas Nigellus Black's eldest son was disowned for being pro-Muggle. I think that'd be a fascinating story. Does anyone know any good ones involving the ancestors of the characters we know and love (or hate)?

I haven't read this one myself yet, but the author consistently writes high quality work (his most notable work being Unatoned, one of the most well-written and professional fanfics I've read until now).

  For the Ancient and Noble House of Black, the height of power marked the beginning of its decline. A game of politics, for personal gain, for the good of everyone... but using Voldemort's rise to prevent a war was a gamble.-- Winner of DLPs January Contest.
