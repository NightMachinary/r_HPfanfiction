** It's worse when they don't kill them, I think.

In the downward spiral saga, Harry does some horrible, /Horrible/ things to Ginny and one of the twins. Killing them would be a mercy, so they are kept alive.

Edit: oh, and Tonks. Poor, poor Tonks.

******** Out of curiosity, how would you do both of those things better? I personally tend to just avoid trying to do text for thoughts unless its a short fic where most of the conversations are in the main characters' head anyways. Differentiating languages though seems to be important in most cases.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord.

** Can't renember the fic, but Harry finds some flesheating moss, and puts a piece under Snapes toenail, and watch him slowly get eaten by it. (I think it was supposed to keep the host alive for as long as possible, taking over from the various organs and such, think it would take months for the host to die) bonus is that he keeps it hydrated by peeing on Snape. Its one of the best ways to kill off Snape i have read so far.

** *Faery Heroes*. A dimension/time traveling Harry breaks Snape's hands and legs, plonks him into an expanded cauldron filled with water and leaves him there to be boiled alive. Linkffn(8233288)

*Potters Against the World*. A time traveling Harry, Rose (Harry's twin sister) and Gabrielle gruesomely kill both Umbridge and Fudge. Umbridge's death isn't directly described but there is an entire tribe of mountain trolls and their cooking stake involved, and Umbridge lasted 32 minutes before dying. Fudge was placed under an enchantment that would keep him petrified, silent and /burning/ in stasis for a /decade/. This is one big revenge fic with a twincest warning. Other people who die include Skeeter, Snape and Draco Malfoy with the Dursleys forced into 30 years of hard labor with the goblins. Linkffn(12200475)

*Evil Be Thou My Good*. The Dursleys, Voldemort and his Death Eaters are tortured for eternity by the cenobites called by Harry using the Lament Configuration. Harry tricks Umbridge and Fudge to open the Configuration and they end up in the same situation. Harry Potter/Hellraiser crossover one-shot. Linkffn(2452681)
