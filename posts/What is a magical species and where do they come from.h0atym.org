What the title says. Where do you think magical palnts/animals/plant-animal hybrids come from? Did they just evolved from non magical species through natural selection or magical gama radiation mutations? Or were they created in cauldrons by mad wizard scientists or accident prone potioneers?

Furthermore, what counts as a magical creature? Does the creature needs to have explict magical ability or just magical origins? If the first asumption is correct, what makes things like a hippogriff magical? If the second assumption is corrrect, does a teacup transfigured into a flamingo count as a magical creature?

Further Furthermore do wizards and witches count as magical creatures? If not, why do Crups and Kneazles count as magical creatures(provided they are accepted as subspecies of cats and dogs.)?


** I like Noodlehammer idea of this subject

the ones that can be used in wand cores, was normal animals that used accidental magic and evolved to keep it, the oldest are more powerful like phoenix and youngest weaker, like Crup

and the rest, it was wizard experimentation like Hagrid with his fire-crab hybrid

*** I like this idea. Still, what defines the difference between the transfigured teacup flamingo and the hippogriff?

**** transfiguration is temporary unless is animagus

and hybrid animals are magic impregnated with another species and magic helped until birth

liked the Basilisk

***** Where does it say transfigurations are temporary? If my memory is correct Barty Crouch Jr. Turned his fathers corpse into a bone and left it in the forbidden forest. I think if transfiguration was a temporary thing, he wouldnt be so callous as to leave a corpse on a timer where Hagrid or Centaurs could discover easily.

****** We are given no canon indication that transfiguration is temporary. That is strictly fanon.

** Given that humanoid species (like Goblins or Giants) can have fertile offspring with humans, Id guess they are magical mutatilns of humans (or humans are mutations of one of them).

Otherwise, it seems like there can be be magical "background radiation". Muggle electronics don't work due to high magical interference, and powerful wizards like Dumbledore can identify strong magic just through their senses. We also know that some substances have apparently natural properties for magic, such as different types of wood resulting in different types of wands (which are basically magic conductors). There are also numbers with magical properties (arithmancy), and star constellations can have magical effects as well.

So my guess would be that magical creatures (and plants) had some ancestor that for some reason received a sufficiently high dose of background magic, possibly concentrated due to special circumstances, and received a form of magical mutation. A mutation that then was transmitted to their offspring after mating with a regular member of their species.

Though of course, intelligent design by wizards, if humans were the first magical species, would also be possible.

Edit: Now that I think about it, magical creatures might also be the result of human animagi mating with mundane animals. Resulting in a creature that's technically animal, but with magic.

** I just assumed they were like the wizard/muggle equivalents of other animals. But I think a lot of them are bred by wizards. I think there's a department in the ministry that deals with breading creatures.

** My headcanon says that there once was an advanced civilization back before the Toba super volcano went off, that was magical where our society is technological, but that over the course of their development they depleted certain magical natural resources, and made it impossible to follow in their footsteps. Like what would happen if we used up all the coal and oil in the world. Sure, we might find a way to not need it anymore, but if another civilization had to start over with no coal or oil, they'd have a problem with kicking off their own industrial revolution.

This civilization, we'll call them the Lantians, saw the Toba Cataclysm coming, or maybe they were just planing ahead, and like our own vaults, they set up sanctuaries, to ensure that they'd have enough left over to rebuild if need be. Maybe Toba was natural, or maybe it was the result of their own ‘Mutually Assured Destruction', just with volcanic fire and ashes, instead of nuclear. Either way, the Toba Cataclysm happened, and wiped the Lantians away, reshaping the world and beginning the little ice age that nearly wiped out humanity in our own history.

But, wonder of wonders, their planning payed off. Enough humans survived to begin rebuilding, with all knowledge of magic either internationally or accidentally lost. Maybe the Lantians were a previous branch of evolution, or maybe they were Homo Sapien Sapiens, just like us; but either way Our people were nearly wiped out. Maybe we were saved by them to rebuild what they could not, or maybe it was all chance. Either way, as time passed, the protections on the Lantian Sanctuaries failed, one after another; but they lasted long enough that the dust had settled and the world had healed. Somehow, a recessive gene showed up, either from a Sanctuary or random mutation, that would allow the plant or animal that had it access to the Lantian Magic. It was a good enough evolutionary advantage that it expanded quickly at first, until there was a full magical ecosystem again. But those magical natural resources were still missing, so technology would eventually come to rule the day.

Then, at some point in our own history, stories surfaced of a Lost City. Atlantis, the city that sank into the sea. The magical people looked, but the city was never found. Could there have been a survivor? Or had another Sanctuary fallen, so long after all the others? Either way, wand magic was developed soon after, and magic became just a little bit easier to use. Suddenly, it could be standardized; it would take the magical people hundreds of years more to do anything truly impressive with it, but that could be marked a point of some beginning. Were there more Sanctuaries? There would have to be. There was no way that this was all the Lantians had wanted saved. Or... did they not want us to follow their own footsteps, but instead carve our own future.

*** Of course, if you want to know the Truth, as it is in my headcanon, than it's that Lantians had Horcrux too; theirs just didn't drive you insane. I've got a whole sacrifice system for why that is. Also, every surviving Lantian is dissolutioned with their own people, having watched what they did to the world and had to wait out the 40,000 years since. But all the same, yes, there were survivors. Not maybe, but Peverell, Flannel and Ollivander are examples of families that interacted with atleast one of them.

That's also why the name ‘Lantian' is known. It was passed on by a noteworthy magical historian whose name has been lost to time. That was his Sacrifice. He would live to see and record history, but he would not be remembered for who he was, only for what he did. Every one of them was like that, having traded something of extreme value for something else equally wanted, the former just happening to include immortality. The Lantians were long lived people, but they weren't immortal to a man. In fact, they considered immorality to be part of the Sacrifice, part of the cost they'd pay for what they really wanted.

X---x---x----

And to answer your real question, now that I've covered all of that, A magical creature is a creature with access to the Lantian Ambient Mana Dynamos, or one that has a mana core of their own. The LAMD's actual name is lost to time, but they're the Ley Lines. The Lantians created them as a sort of magical terraforming project. Like if we could control the weather. Sapience is necessary for a mana core, given mana is the combination of Will and Intent. You have to have both, or you can't make your own mana. You can, however, still use ambient mana, either way.
