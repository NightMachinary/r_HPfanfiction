For those of you who read TvTropes, you'll probably be familiar with the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FandomSpecificPlot/HarryPotter][Fandom-Specific Plot]] as applied to Harry Potter, but what are some of the smaller-scale repeated patterns one often sees between stories? I'm just trying to find a way to "collect" as many as I can for future reference, and just for fun.


** "Harry is a wolf Animagus." One of my favourites if its well written. It is, however, overused enough to be a trope
