The following is a list of 124 fanfics in the hp fandom, they all have three things in common, none if them are less than 50k words (most over 100k), all of them focus roughly on Harry as the main character, and all of them are at least slightly au. Why? Because I've read the books so many times that when I go to fanfiction I tend to look for something new. Some of these are great, some are good, some are mediocre, some are bit cheesy and possibly a little bad. None are flat out horrible, (judged on mostly objective measures such as grammar, accuracy of info, writing structure (very different from plot), continuity, presence of plot holes, etc. NOT JUDGED ON STYLE, PAIRING, GENRE, PREMISE, OR GENERAL STORY (other than if the story is at least a little captivating) ).

I was planning on including the author names, but then I realized how ridiculously long that would take so I didn't. Most of the fic names are unique enough that it shouldn't be an issue, but there are some that it could be a problem.

NOTE: if you are looking for Harry/Ginny, you are in the wrong place. As I said, I look for things other than just more of the same stuff as the books when I look for fics so there are very few canon pairings in this list.

SECOND NOTE: the order of this list does not reflect quality in any way, they are simply numbered for organizational purposes, other than the numbering, the only organization is that if there is a lot of a certain pairing, they will all generally be near each other on the list.

THIRD NOTE: there is not very much fluff or angst in the majority of these fics, plenty of pairings, but not much fluff or angst. Just a heads up. Also very little Slash.

** You say the list is comprised of 124 titles yet there's only 121 mentioned. Anyway, the only ones I heard of was Blindness and the ones written by robst. Besides that, I most likely won't even attempt to read any other titles on this list of yours without a summary (yet that could take you a while to compile together). I guess I'm on the search for more specific-type stories with Charlie Weasley and Hermione Granger with no Ron bashing and a badass Ginny.
