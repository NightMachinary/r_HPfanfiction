Why do people like to give him square glasses or other such apparel? His glasses are iconic, and they kind of represent him, why do people like to change that?


** Personally, it's wish fulfilment.

I tend to fix Harry's eyes because my massively-near-sighted, practically blind self would /leap/ on a magical eye-sight fixing potion/spell/thing.

*** IMO the glasses are iconic... for the abuse he had to suffer. I think that he would get a different pair as soon as he could, as well as the wardrobe. Yet people here are not disturbed by Harry getting new clothes, but replacing the glasses is somehow a sacrilege.

And certainly, a new guardian would take care of those he had since they were held together with tape and repair charms. Anything else would be neglect.

***** Ignorance is no excuse. And anyone claiming to be Harry's adoptive parent must notice the clear signs of abuse. Which is why I cannot see Molly in that role.

Edit: Also, you realise that Harry is still growing, right? So a replacement wardrobe would be necessary every year or two, and at least one new pair of glasses along the way. If any guardian did not replace Harry's worn out clothing, then they should lose their status and face legal consequences. If they do not notice how abusive the Dursleys were, what does that say about their own parenting abilities?

It kinda is, a legitimate clash of cultures can easily confuse what is foreign with what is abuse.

Clear signs? Harry looked like and was pretty much raised like a poor person, not an abused one, its only clear its abuse if you find out how wealthy the Dursleys are.

******* Harry was clearly malnutritioned, he was mistrustful of adult and emotionally shunted. Not to mention that the UK has enough social security measures to prevent anyone from living a life like Harry does.

Also, the Dursleys were clearly abusive and anyone even remotely interested in Harry would find that out pretty quickly. Between Petunia trying to bash his skull in, Marge setting a dog on him and Dudley + gang beating him up as a pastime, it was not even subtle. You ought to ask some questions about Harry's past, and him getting cagey would be a major red flag.

******** Canon Harry wasn't particularly distrusting of adults compared to Ron and Hermione who both had loving parents. And he wasn't clearly malnourished, he was short and skinny, I dont believe for a second that you have never met a child that is short and skinny despite being well fed. Even James was described as skinny despite being loved and spoiled by his parents l.

Also I am not denying that the Dursleys were abusive, but rather this isn't something thats clear when meeting Harry. He isn't exactly somebody who acts like a victim people expect of abused children.

**** The wardrobe definitely needs to go but the glasses don't necessarily have to be changed. Idk if its canon or fanon but James Potter has the same kind of glasses, the round ones? So he could keep wearing the same kind of glasses as a sort of connection to his father.

***** Even if he wants to keep the style, new frames would be a must even if similarly shaped. Although I can certainly see Harry wanting something different to what the Dursleys forced upon him. And the connection to James seems too coincidental for me tbh.

******* There's one argument for each side. A connection to James vs distance from abuse. And given that Harry already looks like a carbon copy of James with Lily's eyes, I think that this connection would not be strengthened by glasses, making the abuse the stronger argument.

** The poor kid's been wearing the same falling-apart glasses for /years./

They're probably horribly uncomfortable, don't fit correctly, and if the prescription was ever the right one, it likely isn't anymore.

Even if the Dursleys got them through the NHS (in which case the only cost is the time it takes them to get them), once he's in Hogwarts - who's going to notice and complain if they don't take him for checkups and an updated pair?

Also, he's better off with contact lenses - with glasses, you don't have corrected peripheral vision. As such, for Quidditch and fighting, he is at a distinct disadvantage. That he is as good at Seeking as he is speaks volumes about how freaking talented he is.

[I am terribly nearsighted myself, without contacts my peripheral vision can tell if something relatively large is moving, but not much else, if I had to catch a foe, spell, or Snitch off to my side like that, I'd be kind of screwed]

** They are iconic to the fans of the series but not necessarily to Harry so I could see it being done to signal that he is going to be his own man, be more proactive, etc.

Having said that I would never do it myself.

** Well, there are a lot of people who wear glasses out there, and some aren't happy about it. For instance, going from wearing glasses to wearing contacts or getting LASIK can be a big confidence boost for some people.

A Harry that's a bit more proactive or independent might have different glasses or fixed eyesight to show that. Alternatively, the writer might know firsthand how annoying glasses can be and want their own gone - so Harry getting an opportunity to do so might be a form of just what they would do in his shoes.

Or, alternatively, there's another simple one - they don't see it as iconic to the story, and would rather see him with different glasses/no glasses.

** Well considering that the Dursleys didn't like harry and did the absolute bare minimum (and in most cases canon details and/or implies enough abuse to probably put the Dursleys in jail), it's unlikely that Harry had any choice in the appearance of the glasses. Hence a lot of Fics give harry the choice to get glasses/frames that he likes.

And being someone who has worn glasses my whole life I would've jumped at a potion that would correct my eyesight. Hence, the fics that do that. And when I finally got the chance to really pick my own frames (eg i was paying for them so completely ignored cost), the frames I chose looked nowhere near what I wore when I was younger.

I know folks who every time they needed glasses they looked completely different from their previous pair. So again I see no problem with fics that either change what Harry's glasses look like or completely gets rid of them.

** I could be wrong, but I think in one of her writings for pottermore, probably that Quidditch match, JKR gives Harry gold glasses. I always imagined adult Harry got rid of everything that represented life at the Dursleys.

** Glasses are a weakness, especially in a fighting situation. They are fragile (his are frequently broken by Dudley), can be lost or taken away leaving him blind, and make it nearly impossible for him to see when it's raining (refer to the quidditch game 3rd year). Anybody who's realistic about him having to fight for his life (again) would see them as a severe disadvantage and seek to fix it with either contacts or eyesight correcting spells/potions.
