It's embarrasing but I don't remember anything else besides Harry being in Slytherin, working hard to fit in and even survive, and there being a couch / sofa with embroidered (?) snakes on it in the common room. Harry spoke to those snakes using Parseltongue, and I think at some point he made them attack another student in anger.
