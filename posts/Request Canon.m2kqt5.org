I know that this might seem weird but what are the best canon compliant fics. Specifically from philosophers stone onwards in regards to time placement.


** I would recommend this one author who just writes canon-compliant fics (mostly one shots) my personal favorites series is "Missing Hogwarts Moments"

** I quite like canon compliant fics if they explore a different character's POV, or look at something which happened 'off screen' in the origonal story! I have written a few if you wan to take a look. I'm on A03 and Fanfiction.net as JamRolyPoly. Most are one-shots, one is a full length but covers a wider time frame than you are looking for. It follows Narcissa Malfoy. linkffn(Ophiuchus: The Serpent Bearer. The Story of Narcissa Malfoy) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13747780/1/Ophiuchus-The-Serpent-Bearer-The-Story-of-Narcissa-Malfoy]]

  A Death Eater's wife, Draco's mother, Bellatrix's sister and the witch who made an Unbreakable Vow with Severus - but who was Narcissa really? Canon-compatible, (books 1-7) following Narcissa from her seventh year at Hogwarts in 1972 through to the immediate aftermath of the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998. All chapter titles are named after constellations and their myths. Complete.

** I would say harshly, that the best canon are the books by JKR. Not only are they better written than 99.9 % of all fanfiction, but this question also involves basic tenets of the fanfiction effort. I think the only sensible canonical fanfiction stories are either pre- or post-canon-time (e.g., Marauders-time, post-war, next-generation fics; strangely there are very few Hogwarts Mystery-time Tonks/Charlie time stories) or what I have in my folders =elsewhere_at_hogwarts/= (e.g., “The Dream Diary by MandyinKC” linkao3(14894849) ... small one-shots with plot completely unrelated to the canonical story) and =non-Hogwarts/= (e.g., “Molly Weasley and the Second Cousin by ZebJeb” linkffn(13502309)), stories completely outside of the main canonical story (and yes, this is actually AU as well).

*** It's definitely harder to do well-done canon-compliant fics that take place during the HP books. I think someone could have fun writing short stories or one-shots for characters who aren't in Harry's year or house, but you're far more constrained for characters who regularly interact with Harry & co. Attempting to do a longfic would be a challenge, and your best bet would be for it to avoid Hogwarts while Harry's at it, focusing on adult characters of the series.

While there are characters and events established as occurring before the HP books that would need to still occur, there is a lot of room for flexible story-telling because we don't have it all laid out.

Cursed Child is just fanfiction written by two men that JKR allowed to be published, so I think that can be scrapped for a canon-compliant fic without issue. One thing I do wonder though is if a fic would be considered canon compliant only if it takes the DH epilogue into account. A lot of fics will say EWE? to say the fic is canon compliant except it ignores the epilogue.

#+end_quote

While I agree that Cursed Child was, at many points, truly horrifically bad (I recently re-read and the fact that anyone decided to go ahead and have Scorpius Malfoy say the line "my geekness is a-quiver" made me want to scream), its general concept has produced at least one really fantastic story: surrogate by 17734 on ao3.

Before reading this story I never bought into Bellatrix/Voldemort shipping, or a resulting child, but this story is written masterfully with incredible thought, detail, and characterization. It's canon compliant, focusing mainly on the events from Deathly Hallows from Voldemort's POV, but with flashbacks as well ranging back to Bellatrix and Andromeda's time together in school.

It's a WIP so hopefully that's not a deal breaker for you, but the author generally posts every 8 weeks or so and it's worth the wait for each new chapter. I've never read fanfic this good and literally cannot recommend it enough.

**** There are [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian stories]], [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?uid=143134][Mrs_Granger ones]], many other (obviously mostly Hinny) ones: linkao3(601124), linkao3(373224) and many others, which are quite good and more or less fully canon-compliant (minus the cursed Cursed Child and some JKR ramblings on Pottermore/Twitter).

  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)

  Beginning immediately after the Epilogue, this story follows Scorpius, Rose and Albus through their Hogwarts years and beyond. Childish fears and desires soon turn to more serious dilemmas as some members of the Ravenclaw trio are forced to grow up too soon. Albus wants to be remembered for being something other than Harry Potter's son. Scorpius knows his father expects him to follow in his footsteps, but how long can he keep his friends, his music and his OWL in Muggle Studies a secret? And Rose has yet to decide what she wants...

** It's really not a weird request. Liking canon and wanting moar Harry Potter is pretty normal here.

For making you rethink canon, I recommend linkffn(The Snape Chronicles). Harry's actions are really seen in a different light.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

** I personally prefer the ones that deal with the political turmoil following the second war. I mean Voldemort did a violent takeover but he mostly used people in the system already (either as his followers or under the Imperius) and the bias favoring the Purebloods was already in place (Voldemort just turned it up to 11). After Voldemort's fall, there is a great need for some cleaning in the ministry so the sudden transition turns the magical Britain into complete chaos because there are new inexperienced or unknown figures taking over the scene. In addition to that, the ministry has to deal with trying caught Death Eaters, as well as catching the escaped ones. Also the public sentiment is probably very anti-Dark Arts and dark wizards and witches or anyone who has an association with them.

My personal favorite story on this topic is linkffn(7374621).

Also I am a fan of canon compliant stories told from someone else's perspective or occurring at different times than the series.

Also Vekin87's Albus Potter series deals a lot with that with some of the bad guys being former vigilante organizations that sought to capture and do their own justice against Voldemort's supporters and many of the significant adults not having a formal education because the Death Eaters had destroyed a lot of records about Muggleborns.
