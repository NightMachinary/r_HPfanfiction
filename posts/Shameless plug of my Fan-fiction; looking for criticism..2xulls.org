Hello everyone,

I have written the beginning of a fan-fiction, and I would be very appreciative if you could tell me what a good, or bad, job I'm doing. Here is the link: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11070364/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Last-Enemy]]

Please be as brutal and honest as you possibly can. Thank you! I am more than willing to answer any questions, as well.


** Just some general thoughts....

First chapters are important. They're a hook. Reading this first chapter, I could tell you nothing about the story if there was no summary. Planning what classes to take shouldn't be the central point around which this chapter revolves. Of course, there's a lot of fics that just do a-day-in-the-life sort of thing, but it loses a lot of agency when there's not a true sense of purpose.

The writing is fine for the most part. A beta would always help, but I'm not one to get too nit-picky over it. The one thing I would say is that it is a lot like stage directions like [[/u/pinkerton_jones]] said. Most of the story is driven by dialogue, but the dialogue is always bracketed with lots of descriptions. It would help if you picked a more solid POV. Right now, it shifts between several people in one chapter and makes it difficult to really relate

** The writing is good even if the explanations are a tad over long. You need to decide where to pitch you characters; at one point they're war-hardened adults, the next they're losing their tempers over little things like children.

I'm sorry to say I can't read any more though, I struggle to read anything that involves Hermione in any positive way. If you end up having her killed off in a horrifically violent way after being bashed for a few chapters let me know! :-)

*** Thank you for taking the time to read, and for your feedback! I understand where you're coming from on pitching the characters; I am doing my best to pitch them as still adolescents, but that have gone through the horrors of war. The war wasn't long enough to sap all childishness from them, but enough to change them.

Thanks again, Hermione's not going to die, sorry!

** It reads like script directions and lines rather than a story. I can see what the characters are supposed to be doing but not what they are doing.

*** Ah, I don't disagree. I'm finding it hard to capture the essence of what Rowling created in her writing, if not in her story-telling. Thank you.

**** Than you probably should not have broken up the Golden Trio tbh. The relationship they have with each other is to ingrained into the overall story of Harry Potter that if you are going to try to write a canon-complaint story than you should keep the trio together. Sweeping Ron and an 8 year relationship under the rug and it not having a pretty lasting effect on Harry and Hermione just seem silly tbh. If you hate the R/Hr pairing then don't write it and just keep it about the Trio. Shipping has done more to ruin potentially good stories than it has to enhance them tbh. The Harry Potter series in general isn't very romance-oriented.
