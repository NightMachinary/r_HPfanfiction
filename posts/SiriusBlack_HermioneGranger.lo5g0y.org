I just read Promise to the Past on Wattpad and it was one of the best fics I've ever read!!

I was wondering does anyone have any good Sirius/Hermione time travel recommendations ?

  “Are you familiar with Time-Turners Miss Granger?” The question was the catalyst that sent Hermione back on a secret mission to stop Voldemort before October 31st, 1981. Her work with the original order was important, but clearly nobody relayed this to her partner. Young and not yet tainted by the pain of loss and Azkaban, Sirius Black was a lot harder to manage than Ron or Harry. When he wasn't making every situation the punchline to a long winded joke, he was making his salacious intentions well known.

  A mysteriously faulty time-turner lands Hermione in the year 1977---right as the Marauders are starting their 7th year. With the knowledge of the fate of the world and everyone around her, Hermione feels like quite a bit of responsibility has been thrust upon her. But of course, despite having the fate of the universe in her palms, Sirius Black still somehow manages to make himself Hermione's number one concern and priority---especially as Hermione accidentally let on that she knows entirely too much about Sirius and his friends.--here's a spotify playlist for this sin of a fic lol

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir.

  An accident sends Hermione to a time where the war is approaching and where she has a chance to change more than one fate. The story begins at Easter, after the snatchers have caught our golden trio (Deathly Hallows CH 23: Malfoy Manor), and it is an Alternate universe from there. Some Hermione/Sirius, but Hermione/Regulus is endgame.

  "Knockturn Alley," Hermione breathed, and a rush of relief flooded inside of her. At least she didn't end up amongst cavemen or dinosaurs. Time-turner fic. Sirius Black falls behind the veil, the time-turners are destroyed, and a Gryffindor is going to change history.

  When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner.

  Hermione hesitated, searching for the words as her throat went dry. "You asked how I knew your name...I know who you are because I've seen your picture in the Potter's cottage thousands of times. There was an explosion, you disappeared from your flat---this flat." She took a shaky breath. "You've been gone nearly twenty years, Sirius."
