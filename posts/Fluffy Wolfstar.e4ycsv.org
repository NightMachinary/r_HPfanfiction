Hey all,

I'm looking for some fluffy, cute, long wolfstar. I want shy Remus and pushy Sirius, preferably during their Hogwarts days. It can have smut, but it doesn't have to. Thank you


** Fluffy Wolfstar?

The first idea that came to my mind is Remus giving Padfoot a really good wash to make his fur coat nice and soft, and then for Sirius to do the same to (a Wolfsbaned) Moony.

Softest cuddly doggos.

Edit: Unfortunately, I haven't read enough Wolfstar to remember any fics to recommend.

  Sirius rides a flying motorbike, and snogs strangers in pubs, and strikes moody poses Remus finds irritatingly attractive. But for Remus, who drinks milky tea and wears flannel pyjamas, there's a chasm cracked right down the fault line between wanting and doing. How he wants, though. How he wants.

  Summer, 1977. With the full moon approaching, Sirius heads up to the Lupins' countryside cottage to make himself useful. Or to make a complete and utter arse out of himself, because really, that's all he can seem to do around Remus these days.

  "...he hadn't planned to jump Sirius' bones almost as soon as he walked through the door, had actually planned to fix him a square meal and then set about avoiding him for a few days -- or forever -- but he'd been marinating in whiskey for over an hour and Sirius had fucking smiled at him as he pushed the door closed behind him and that smile, it's always been Remus's undoing."

  Sirius talks, begs, and bribes Remus into a spontaneous trip to Brighton the summer of their graduation. Remus loses all sense of direction; Sirius loses his shirt; Remus kisses the last moth-eaten vestiges of his sanity a long, sloppy goodbye.

  Instead of going home, Sirius walked the darkened streets of central London, dragging from a cigarette and hugging his arms to his chest to fend off the cold, until he found another bar. This was it. This was Sirius' life. Until one day, it wasn't.

  James celebrates Christmas by drugging himself on powdered thestral-hoof (as a joke), Remus visits Madagascar (it's sunny and it brings out his freckles), Peter takes up smoking (and quits), and Sirius flat-out refuses to read Nature's Nobility ever again (he would also like to make it clear that he detests the Christmas decorations in Grimmauld Place).  This version of events takes place from December 1975 to April 1976. There were some animals hurt in the telling of this story, but the boys would like to ensure you that the Giant Squid isn't one of them.

  While war brews on the horizon beyond the walls of Hogwarts, the infamous Triwizard Tournament resurfaces just in time for the Marauders' seventh year. It's one more reason for Remus Lupin to pull out his hair and prematurely wrinkle. And another reason? It walks, talks (too much), and chews up Remus' belongings while in dog form.

  There are a few things Sirius really didn't count on for Christmas of 1979. The extreme sexual confusion is one of them; Remus Lupin is approximately seventy-eight of the rest.
