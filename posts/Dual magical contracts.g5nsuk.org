Both Dumbledore and Barry Crouch Jr(still as moody) put Harry's name into the goblet in secret. During the ceremony his name comes out twice, causing there to be two magical contracts for him, he needs to fulfill them both so he has to complete each task twice!

Tasks can be the same as canon or whatever you would like them to be.


** Lol, I couldn't do this fic justice but a couple scenes popped in my head that made me laugh. Most of my inspiration come from dreams so I see my fics before I write most of them.

I saw him offered (and taking the offer) of having both dragons in the areana at once. He thought out would gain him bonus points but instead he got first and forth because he got the eggs cleanly, as he was exiting he got blasted by one dragon causing him to drop an egg. Second task he has to rescue 2 people, but as in canon, he chooses to save the little veela girl. He ends up strapping all three to himself, but he's so impeded he takes longer it surface ship he doesn't get as many bonus points.

Going into the 3rd task, he's tied for first with Cedric and tied for 2nd or 3rd with another champion so a huge argument ensures of whenhe goes in. Some judges want to average the scores, some want him to use the lesser score, and some want him to use the higher. In the end the champions start discussing it, he tells them he doesn't care and since he wasn't meant to be in three tournament at all volunteers to go in 30 seconds after the 3rd place champ. However, they can't get the 'adults' attention so they proceed on their own. FakeMoody notices too late so while he helps Harry get to the cup before or with Cedric, it's in different ways so the other two champions don't get hurt by him. Those two get to the center of the maze at different times but there's nothing there so they decide they must have lost and fight their way back out of the maze together. The grown ups are STILL arguing. They force themselves into the middle of the argument and report their findings. Everyone goes silent at this news because the cup was meant to be a portkey all along, destination where Harry brings Cedrics body back to in canon. BCJ merely modified it to make a sidetrip so Riddle can choose if he wants to announce Harry's death by sending his body back by portkey or not. I picture the portkey returning with Harry and/or Cedric (living status left to possible author's discretion) during the silent confusion which brings an end to the tournament. Like it did in canon.

** This happened in a fic, I just can't remember the name. It was either twice, or twice as hard?
