I think it was a harem fic involving all three girls, but I can't remember for sure. I just remember the restaurant scene, but nothing else.


** linkffn(11766390) This has a restaurant meeting, but they recognize that they received their favorite foods, not a particular spice.

  On 2 May, 2013, three women have dinner at the hottest French restaurant in London, commemorating for the fourteenth time someone they can't forget. They have the meal of a lifetime and a revelation which will last all their days. Hurt/comfort. Amelia Bones/Harry Potter, Hermione Granger/Harry Potter, Susan Bones/Harry Potter. Osseous Harmony.
