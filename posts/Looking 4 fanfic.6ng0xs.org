What do I want?

A) Independent (dark) Hermione, not friends with Ron etc (can be Slytherin) - so far I know "Mudblood Mistress", "She Rises", "Cultural Anthropology" or something like that (don't remember the correct name)

B) A good OC (Muggleborn) discovering Hogwarts/ wizarding world

C) Strong Neville Longbottom, Independent Ginny Weasley

Preferred: frequent updates or finished

Thx a lot c: Nyx


** linkffn(Lisa Turpin Goes To Hogwarts) for B. It is now abandoned, but the author is rewriting it with a plot. The original is worth reading.

  ABANDONED. See re-write with actual plot structure! Lisa always knew she was magical. After all, her mother was a powerful witch and Lisa was already mastering the arcane secrets of witchcraft. Then, an owl appeared with a letter. What in the Goddess's name was Hogwarts? (The Adventures of a Wiccan trained witch attending Hogwarts)
