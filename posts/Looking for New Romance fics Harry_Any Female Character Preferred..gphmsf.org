I am a huge bitch for romance, I have hit a romance dry spell and need more but am having trouble finding anything good. Can you guys recommend me some good recent (within like the last year or so) Romance fics that you've read? I don't really care who Harry is pared with as long as they aren't a death eater/draco/snape/voldemort/tom riddle (since for some reason people try and make a distinction between voldemort and tom)

I'm fine with femslash and i'm warming up to slash (i'm a heterosexual male so it's still not my cup of tea but i've been reading more of it)

But yea, any recommendations?


** I'm also a huge fan of romance and here is a list of romance fanfics I have read and am reading. Could you send me some you have read?

Harry x Hermione - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13581651/1/How-to-get-engaged-to-Hermione-Granger]]

  Harry doesn't understand how he's supposed to learn the genteel art of pureblood etiquette from the rudest arsehole he's ever known. Written for the 2012 H/D Career Fair.

#+begin_quote
  A world where heroes defended and protected the weak has fallen. In a single day, the world's population was left quirkless. In it's wake the world was reborn in darkness and lawlessness and the heroes that survived the aftermath disappeared leaving everyone to fend for themselves. A decade later a new power has risen, an underground syndicate that calls the shots and keeps the peace, but on their terms. You (female reader) find yourself caught by the syndicate and charged of murder. About to be executed cruelly, an abrupt change of plans turns your world upside down. Gifted to the Boss who runs the show as a birthday gift, you find yourself part of his unique collection as his personal living doll. This bizarre world makes you question everything you ever thought about the once great heroes when you discover they are now the one's making all the rules. Quirkless but still deadly, you become a part of their world and soon find that all things considered, it may not be such a bad deal after all. That is, as long as you remember the Boss does not take well to sharing his toys. COMPLETE!
