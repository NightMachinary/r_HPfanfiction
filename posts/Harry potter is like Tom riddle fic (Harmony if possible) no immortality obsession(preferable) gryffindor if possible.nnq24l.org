I want harry like tom riddle with all the cunning and charm (but if possible and it's a big if I don't want him to be a dark wizard instead he uses his brilliance for the good) the situation in the bracket is preferable but not obligatory for fic suggestions. If possible I also want harry to remain in griffyndor because he asks for it or something but I know that's probably impossible if I want him like tom but if it is available link that fic. I also want the griffyndor trio to remain but this is optional even if it's not there I don't mind but I do want harmony (preferable if not there anything else works). That's it. Do not comment about harry being good, griffyndor and tomlike is impossible, this is fanfiction come-on. I want him like tom in almost every way when it comes to talent, charm, aptitude, etc except I don't want him to be obsessed about not dying(this is /very very/ preferable but still link a fic if he is obsessed about immortality). That's it.
