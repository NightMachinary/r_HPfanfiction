One's that don't make him ooc. Super nice or trying to murder people. I don't care if it's a ship pairing, him raising a kid, etc etc, just that it written by someone who hates him and actually shows him how he is in canon or his development is written well.


** I know you're looking for a full length fic probably, but this short missing scene on Snape - when he goes to plead for Lily's life from Voldemort - is an exceptional addition to the character! It's only a small read but I truly love how in-character it is, he's horrendous without meaning to be and the mental gymnastics - oof.

#+begin_quote
  Harry is accused of burglary. The Dursleys leave him to rot. Dumbledore sends Snape to remedy the situation. Harry finds himself in the care of an irate Snape. Not slash, gen-fic w/ focus on Sevitus relationship. Angst galore. Warnings: language, mentions of abuse/neglect. Un-betaed, un-Britpicked, unapologetic.

** Judging by your request, I think you would like this one the most out of Snape fics I like: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions)

Snape never truly becomes "nice" in it, but isn't the devil either. And he has a much better relationship with Harry, even if they're never actually /friendly/.

Eh? linkffn(7937889) is canon-compatible, and IMHO isn't OOC, but the writer definitely don't hate Snape.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

** For a fairly dark portrayal, I've read about half of linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6622580/]]), which is well crafted but I gather that it may not have a particularly happy ending. Severus intercepted Peter Pettigrew and learned what he'd done, then snatched Lily away before Voldemort arrived, and so Voldemort won. Lily has been Obliviated of the memories of James and Harry, and is Severus' servant whom he treats as kindly as he can get away with (but still keeps locked up).

For one where he has a dark past but more hope for the future, I'm a fan of linkffn(The Peace Not Promised). There are several stories where he goes back from his canon death to his teenage years to try again, but this one is my favourite. Bear in mind it's very long, and not yet complete but updating monthly.

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.
