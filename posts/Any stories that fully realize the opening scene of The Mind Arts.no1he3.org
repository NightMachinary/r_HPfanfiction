Linkffn(the mind arts)

Basically a strong Harry and Dumbledore working and fighting together to combat a Voldemort who could slaughter them both if they were alone.

Mind arts low key one of my biggest disappointments in fanfiction. That opening got me going for so long cuz the writing was competent and then it just totally went off the rails.


** Ugh I feel the exact same painful way about this story.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]
