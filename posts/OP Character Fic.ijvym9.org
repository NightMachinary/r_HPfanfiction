I need recommendations, hit me with the best fics you've got.

*Would prefer to not have:*

- Person x Harem.

- James and Lily abandoning Harry, WBWL fic.

- Pairings.

- Intense smut.

- Dating too young. (I guess 14 is okay, other than that is too young.)

- Weasley!Bashing.

*Would prefer to have:*

- Gamer Ability

- Philosophical Ramblings

- Mad Scientist

- Inventor

- Magic Theory

These are just my preferences, if the fic is good enough and doesn't fulfil one/more of those conditions, that's fine too.
