:END:
Hello my darlings,

Years ago I read a fic where Harry becomes proficient with warding and does either the O.W.L or N.E.W.T on it. I want to say it was one of the "Harry retakes all of his owls" type stories.

I've read so many fanfics that I may be mixing several together but I vaguely remember him having to ward a dollhouse for his tests.

Anyone know which story this is ? Or similar concept stories

*** A great fic but not the one i'm remembering. I want to say that after the exam he wards a house and Aurors try to break the wards.

Its been driving me nuts for years trying to find it to the point I feel it's my own imagination ðŸ¤£
