  Nick welcomes them and they take a look around, watching the ghosts dance and walk through the table of rotting food, trying to taste it. Hermione spies a ghost from the girls' bathroom, Moaning Myrtle, and quickly leads her friends away, hoping not to get into a conversation with her.

  Peeves approaches at this point, mentions having heard the three speaking of Myrtle, and calls Myrtle over. Hermione says hastily that they were just saying how nice she looked tonight, but Myrtle moans that they were making fun of her, and she proceeds to list all the attributes they might have mocked: fat, ugly, moping. Peeves notes that she had forgotten pimply, and Myrtle flees tearfully from the party.

Except we only know that because of the Death Day party itself. If I remember correctly, the Death Day party is what set the year setting for the entire book series. There was no mention of date in the first book. The party is specifically for Nick's 500th Death Day, and the icing on his cake states that he was executed in 1492. This was the first reference to a year in the series that let fans mark when the story took place.

Now, whether that's enough reason to justify the scene is a different question. There are other ways the date could have been relayed to readers without a mostly unnecessary scene.

Tbh I feel like Rowling wrote herself into a corner, because Hagrid also had /another/ offscreen trip for months and months that took him up with Madame Maxime - who then disappeared from the story forever iirc. In retrospect, maybe if Hagrid needed to not be available, that would be the perfect pretext, instead of him taking on essentially two longterm projects on top of two full-time jobs.

Fanon ruins werewolves that way, when they become a social justice issue rather than the manifestation of primal fear and something which wipes out entire villages and plunders graveyards to feast on the recently buried.

HP could use a bit more diversity when it comes to opponents, there's little variety between Voldemort, Death Eaters and dementors. Vampires could be inhumanly fast and, since they are undead, immune to the killing curse. It's easy to make them an actual challenge to a wizard, and IMO that's much better than a Twilight reskin.

****** To clarify, by nuanced I meant more like enriched in one way or another so the audience isn't reading the same thing over and over. She said she wanted to leave vampires out of the story because she didn't think she could add anything that hasn't been done before. Which I'm okay with because she did so much world building other than that.

I felt she had good diversity in opponents. Fluffy the three headed dog, the giant spiders, the basilisk, the literal ghost journal, merpeople, the riddle-giving Sphinx, boggarts, the Inferi, goblins, dragons, and sometimes even house elves.

On top of that, she gave us a million red herrings throughout the story that act like an opponent without actually being Voldemort.

Harry also faced social opposition, ie. Draco Malfoy, Rita Skeeter, and “Potter Stinks” badges.

I'd argue that the Ministry acted as an opponent as well, with their corruption and how often they were in opposition to Harry.

So could she have made vampires work? Probably. But she had so many other things going on that if she wasn't passionate about it then it's good she left them out. Vampires were just a random quirky thing she tossed in sometimes. As an effect, it felt like she was hinting at more than she ended up giving. This is why they stuck out to me.

It's also dangerous to use it, ie:splinching. You wouldn't want to apparate when you weren't feeling well, drunk, hung over, etc. It's also something you can only do if you are going somewhere you've been before, and you know you won't be seen just appearing out of nowhere. The knight bus is almost certainly charmed to be invisible to muggles, we can assume that because it goes through all kinds of muggles areas and is never noticed. The floo network will only take you to magical locations that are hooked up to a floo and have their grates open to travel. Floo powder is implied to be expensive. The knight bus makes perfect sense if you think of it like a muggle bus. It's there for the most vulnerable, yes kids, also the elderly, the poor, and people who don't have other options for whatever reason. It's one of the few ways wizard society seems to provide a service to the needy.

*** Wizards don't give a shit about the Statute of Secrecy. They care that they're not discovered by muggles, but individually, they're irresponsible. That's why Mr. Weasley's department exists, and why the wizards have to send Obliviators everywhere even when they're perfectly capable of being discrete enough to not be noticed in the first place. These are the people who partied in the streets in broad daylight wearing robes and hats when Harry defeated Voldemort, and held the Quidditch World Cup by squatting on some random field somewhere and Obliviating any muggle that came close.

** Not counting the Fantastic Beasts movies and Cursed Child, for which both answers would be "nearly all of it":

- Book 1: Quirrell trying to kill Harry during the Quidditch game sticks out as slightly out-of-character to me. Why did he do it? Why not just wait it out and stay beneath suspicion?
- Book 2: The Valentine. It's a short scene that serves no real purpose that I can think of.
- Book 3 and onwards: Any Divination classes past Trelawney's second prophecy.
- Book 4: The SPEW subplot. It does showcase one of Hermione's character flaws, but it never really gets the resolution it needs - and in my opinion it happens too late in the overall story. What I'd have liked to see is the SPEW thing happening in Year 2 as a subplot, with some form of resolution happening when Harry frees Dobby.
- Book 5: Agree with Grawp. Took up a lot of the book for not really having a long-term point.
- Book 6: Nothing really sticks out to me here.
- Book 7: There's a lot of them. Peter Pettigrew's death scene was an anti-climax for how much that life-debt was hyped up. Ron opening the Chamber of Secrets by imitating Parseltongue, which felt like an ass-pull in order to not need Harry for the basilisk-fang collecting. Half of the camping trip and loads of Dumbledore backstory that doesn't really have much bearing on the plot. Albus Severus Potter.

**** I don't like the hallows, and a good bit of it is because they reinterpret a lot of the nature of magical artifacts while not getting nearly enough explanation. They also seem like a huge retcon in many ways.

Horcruxes were explicitly introduced late, but the concepts and some of the rules governing them were implicitly introduced in Chamber of Secrets, which made their introduction in Half Blood Prince to be relatively smooth. The reader could easily feel, 'oh yeah that all makes perfect sense.'

Whereas with the Hallows, they weren't even implicitly introduced, so they were a huge smack upside the face to the reader when they were introduced almost halfway through the last book in the series. Especially because they ended up being a huge plot device that in many ways decided the end of the series.

The Hallows are not a terrible idea, and there are ways they can fit into canon, but the way they were handled felt like they were shoved-in last minute for plot reasons and the necessary changes they brought to the readers' understanding of magic never got a chance to settle before the series ended.

Also, I can't remember for sure, but I feel like it was mentioned somewhere in the books that the magic in an invisibility cloak tends to wear off after a while, whereas Harry's is literally an heirloom, which would have been a hint that there was something special about it.

The powers of the tool imho are very poorly expressed. Fanfiction gives the whole thing so much more credibility. Like I mentioned in an older post some time ago, it's quite sad that the powers of the cloak were not expanded upwards upon. Its said to be able to shield you from death, which could be interesting in practice. The only unique attributes of the cloak is that it can't be summoned and it doesn't fade, which seems very underwhelming for a famous, revered and powerful artifact :/
