JEE. ZUS. CHRIST! It'll have taken me a whole goddamn hour to figure how to make the link of one of my photos and an Imgur account later but I'm finally here. As you can figure, it has taken way too much time than I would have liked to admit to making this post. But here is [[https://imgur.com/gallery/ttoSCi7][ze map.]]

It's not good as it could be and a bit sketchy in the Polish/Germanic borders, but considering I was limited to modern states and didn't have access to historical ones, it's not that bad. Tell me what you guys and gals think about it.

*** That is indeed true. In my story, like some others, Krum didn't go to the Yugoslav one because it's trash since Grindelwald's War (semi genocide of the intellectual population who protest against tyrannical rule and lack of actual professionals in teaching positions does that) and his skills in Quidditch allowed him to be noticed by Karkaroff and he offered him a place. From Scandinavia to Bulgaria is too big of a students pool and just Scandinavia with Bulgaria seems oddly specific.

*** Rāuarcane, Anmutigerpönix and Òlympos are completely yours truly, Czarnokiesto is directly from linkffn(Animagus at War) by White Squirrel - I highly recommend it and its prequel -, and the one that shares Bulgaria and Yugoslavia I saw in multiple stories but was a concept I'd already thought of for a previous story with a similar background that I deleted. Turkey I put no information because the school where it's children go isn't European and wizarding Albania's dark wizard puppet government doesn't have the resources and the leeway in the ICW to have an officially recognized school of magic and it certainly doesn't want to send its children to study abroad, it could give them ideas.

That sounds very wrong as a German Speaker since it translates to Gracefulphoenix (it should have an H after the P either way) and not in a form which was correct at any time. If you want something with a phoenix reference, Phönixberg (Phoenix Hill) or Phönixburg (Phoenix Castle) sound a lot better in German. Phönixsburg (Phoenix's Castle) if you want to change the case. That being said, the Phoenix is not part of the "German mythology" if you want to call it that.

HOWEVER, I have a solution for that problem. Near Cologne, there is a hill called Drachenfels (Dragon's rock) with a castle ruin atop of it (a proper castle, not something which looks like a Disney palace), overlooking the Rhine. So Drachenfels would be a good option. Depending on where exactly you want that school to be, I can also dig up something there.

**** Does Rāuarcane come from Răuarcane by any chance? I thought that was a breve at first (curvy thing on the a) not a macron (straight line) but it still is weird since "rău" means evil and "arcane" could refer to arcane stuff, as in magic, so it would be translated as "evil magic." Is that what you were going for there? And yes, I am Romanian, so I know what I'm talking about :)

** The bits south of rump Poland should be with Austria and/or Hungary rather than Poland since there is not a lot of history linking them after the failed Crusade for Varna in 1444 (where the Polish/Hungarian/Bohemian Union died with their King on November 10th). A good chunk of Transylvania was culturally Saxon, German was more common as a language in Bohemia than Czech until Nationalism hit in the late 19th century.

Also, why is the historical core of Lithuania not in the Polish group? The Grand Duke of Lithuania was elected King of Poland for more than a century before their dynasty died out and both "countries" formed the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in the Treaty of Lublin, uniting them until the three partitions of Poland(-Lithuania). The Dnieper would be a more suitable boundary, with a Russian exclave around Kiev.

The Baltics are also a mess, culturally Courland is way closer to Germany or the PLC, you can make a case for Liefland (Estonia) being in the Swedish sphere. Karelia should definitely be Finnish, that border was only changed by Stalin's invasion in 1939/40 (Winter War).

Grouping the East and West Balkans is also quite messy, a division into Wallachia, Moldova and Bulgaria at one side and what was Yugoslavia (-Austrian lands) with Albania on the other side. Ragusa/Dubrovnik could be in the Italian sphere, Lombardy and Venetia only became Italian in the late 19/early 20th century after 3-4 centuries under the House Habsburg (and three decades of France in 1515 and under Napoleon).

*** First, I would like to thank you for correcting me, it is greatly appreciated. Second, Slovakia is something I can change easily in both my map and fanfic (since for the latter it is not mentionned yet). Thirdly I'm not sure I completely understand the first part of your last paragraph about the Balkan division; the Austrian lands go to the German school, the Hungarian lands go to the Transylvanian school (which is shared between Hungary, Transylvania and Romania), the Albanians go nowhere because of its political situation, the Greeks go to Òlympos, and the smaller Yugoslavia and Bulgaria go to their own South Slavic school. Since Yugoslavia and Bulgaria are countries I haven't changed yet in my political map following your comment I'm going to send you the newest version in DM. Fourthly, I can't give Scandinavia Karelia because historical Karelia isn't an available state on the site I made this.

**** Transylvania is a bit tricky because the official language was German, under both Hungarian and Austrain rule due to the large number of "Saxon" (Rhenish would be more accurate, but the historical term is saxon) settlers who came there from the 12th century onwards (and later it was used to resettle a lot of Protestants from all over the Habsburg lands (17th and 18th century mostly).

Hungary and Romania in one pot is asking for a lot of violence, especially after Trianon. They never got along well, but after that the relationship was poisoned, especially since Romania annexed all of Transylvania, not only the Romanian majority regions they were supposed to receive according to Wilson.

For the Balkans, I'd place Crotian with the Austrian school, the Dubrovnik area to Italy. Transylvania is historically Hungarian, but Hungary is closer to the West than to Romania/Bulgaria. Not that Bulgaria or Romania should exist in the first place based on 1692 borders, but Bulgaria is canon.

[[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Europe%2C_1700%E2%80%941714.png][This is a good basis for any magical division since the SoS went into effect in 1692 and further muggle conflicts should be of no consequence to wizards]] Within the next 20 years, the Spanish Netherlands and Naples got shuffled around to Austria as a result of the War of the Spanish succession from the Spanish branch of the Habsburgs to the Austrian one and around the same time Sweden lost its Baltic possessions to Russia, so that might have changed, but further wars are too far away to be transferred 1:1 to the magical world.

** I've got so many questions. If Beauxbatons draws srudents from three of the more populated countries in Europe, it's got to be massive. As in at least a hundred and fifty students per year. And say that it's a boarding school, I'm not sure France has the tradition for school houses as the UK, but you've got to split the years up a bit, right? You can't have common rooms for 150+ students or a potions class with 150+ students.

Also, I think it's so odd that JKR claims Durmstrang is in Scandinavia. It does not sound Scandinavian in the slightest, and wouldn't make sense if they draw on students from Bulgaria, and maybe Russia, as I think Poliakoff is Russian. If so, I would be surprised if the Sandinavian countries would agree on a school collaborative with Russia. The Scandinavian countries have never had a good relationship to Russia (or even the Soviet union).

The Nordic countries are similar and friendly between each other despite a complicated history, and have so much in common that I've made a headcanon for myself that Durmstrang is somewhere in central or eastern Europe, while a different school draws students from Sweden, Finland, Norway, Iceland, The Faroe Islands and Denmark (+ Greenland).

*** I personally imagine them being separated by languages in classes, which would make the French classes bigger since it would draw from France, Wallonia, Switzerland, Luxembourg and I imagine some others who speak French from other countries (I mean, is it really the true Beauxbâtons experience if you don't have it in French?). But more seriously, the classes would be separated by languages (but even then it's not all the French together, all the Spanish together, etc. that would be too big). I also don't really think Beauxbätons /has/ common rooms, just an area in the castle (maybe some corridor or wing) where the students have their rooms of 3/4 persons which are randomly selected.

**** If that was the case, what's the point in one school, if all the classes were done three times in three different languages? It just seems to me that it defeats the purpose of having a shared school across several countries. There are international boarding schools irl too, but they choose a language to teach in. Children can learn languages remarkably fast

Beauxbatons should at least have some shared area so they would have other places to go in their spare time.
