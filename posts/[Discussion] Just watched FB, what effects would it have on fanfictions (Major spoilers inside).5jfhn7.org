First of all, I think we are going to have all kinds of extravagant magical trunks. Newt's suitcase probably put every super trunk we have seen in the fandom to shame.

Next, Obscurials and overpowered reparos will be featured in many stories.

Finally, did I hear the term 'magical core' when they were discussing about Credence?

What do you think?

EDIT: another thing I noticed is that it's perfectly ok to side-along apparate no-majs. It also means they should be able to use portkeys and very likely floo travels.


** The trunk issue is one that people seem to have been massively unobservant about when they were watching. It's not that the trunk itself is that big. Rather the trunk contains a number of enclosures (each one maybe 10m x 10m maximum) separated by some kind of magical canvas. That magical canvas is 2 dimensional when you interact with it, acting like any other material, except when you close it up around you then it immerses you into a magical environment that you can move around in. So the size of the trunk is a combination of the large trunk space and the absolutely massive but potentially illusory canvas space.

Regarding obscurials, I'm not sure that there's much place to take them that's interesting. They essentially have one power and that's destruction. They also die before the age of 10, with Credence being the notable exception. And for all their supposed power, note that Grindelwald never seemed to be afraid of Credence.

I think the reparo charms only appear overpowered to people who have had a small-minded approach to HP magic - people who have sought to limit it rather than embrace it. In truth within the 7 original books we have had very little interaction with what qualified adult wizards are capable of, but there are certainly allusions to magic of much greater scale than you see everyday at Hogwarts and in the home.

And no, no mention of magical cores. Credence was said to be powerful, which plenty of wizards have been described as over the series - Dumbledore, Voldemort, Grindelwald, Barty Crouch Sr, Bellatrix, Harry himself. The fact that some wizards are more powerful than others has never been in dispute. What the fandom has discussed in depth rather is a) what does it mean to say a wizard is powerful and b) what factors determine a wizard's power. Specifically with respect to (b), the discussion has been oriented around the nature vs nurture debate and the extent to which it can change over time.

I don't think Credence really adds much to the debate, except that perhaps he is a further indication that enduring adversity is a factor which can lead to one becoming magically powerful.

*** Yeah, but to be fair, it wasn't hugely clear how the trunk worked when I saw it the first time around as you only see the canvas structure properly in a few very quick shots of the erumpet and in the obscurious scene, otherwise they seemed to be able to morph between the 'spaces' of the trunk with just a camera pan... The idea seems to be based on that of using painted backdrops to dioramas to make them seem bigger, which is a great source to draw from, but as it's based on an illusion and there were a whole load of camera tricks added, it's unsurprising there is confusion.

Magical canvas like you say and like the one in the old Discworld game where with the right magical paint you can enter the painted scenery or recursive enlargement charms would be my guess. Not certain how it works with Frank though, as his enclosure didn't look to have a ceiling, so he's still disappearing off somewhere

Given how many abused!Harry fics are out there, it's only logical for authors to assign Obscurial powers to Harry next.

**** It's largely the same as the other movies - I liked the sense of speed to the spells, I like the heavy use of non-verbal magic and blocking techniques, I like the use of apparition to manoeuvre as standard, but I dislike the lack of variety in terms of spell choice and tactics. On balance I am happy.

**** Perhaps. But then, I find it questionable what sort of harm Grindelwald would be prepared to accept in order to achieve this "Greater Good" and also what his conception of the "Greater Good" is to begin with. Those are some of the difficulties with consequentialism - when you weigh the alternatives and try to determine what produces the greatest net good, it is a) highly dependent on your value judgements and characterizations and b) can justify the most abhorrent conduct based on extremely small net good. In other words, there is no attempt at objectivity and no conduct that is off limits. Personally, I'm not a fan of such moral theories.

** Two thoughts. Obscurials seem to give a clear link to dementors. Also, grindlewald and dumbledore are both looking for powerful wizards at the same time. Dumbledore finds riddle and grindlewald credence. Gives motive as to why dumbledore was looking himself.

*** Dumbledore wasn't looking for a powerful wizard, he was simply acting in his duties as Deputy Headmaster to introduce a (seemingly) Muggleborn child to the wizarding world. It was only after Riddle turned out to be a manipulative, ambitious and powerful student that Dumbledore started keeping a closer eye on him, realising that one way or another, Riddle would likely be a big player later.

**** I don't think Credence was actually killed, mainly because the actor is supposed to come back for the next movie and there was a cut scene at the end where he was getting onto a boat.

This could be wild speculation, though.
