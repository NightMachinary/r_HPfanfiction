Hey folks! I'm looking for good alpha/omega stories that are complete and at least 40k words - any recs? I've gotten super hooked on these lately but I haven't been able to find a lot of great writers with longer stories. TIA!

(M/F, M/M, F/F, and Multi pairings all fine by me!)

** I absolutely love A/B/O fics. Unfortunately I am reading in a lot of other fandoms and it's been some time since I've been reading A/B/O fics in the HP fandom. I like to think that my taste in writing has improved over the years and thus my bookmarks in terms of A/B/O in the HP fandom are not the best. Nontheless. Here are the two fanfics which I think you might like.

One is 30k the other one 16k. Sorry that i couldn't find anything longer.

  Oliver Wood, natural born leader in red Gryffindor robes, couldn't be anything but an Alpha and Marcus knows that. His hormones, however, do not.(In which they both have family issues and communication issues and just a lot of issues in general.)

*** I found these two which aren't really A/B/O but good anyways.

This first story is very well written. I loved the characterization of Fenrir in that. Of course it was a bit ooc but very good. (Werewolves and Wizards don't mix) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8434153]])

The second fic is not to everyones liking but it's written well enough so I linked it too Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/899336]])

  Turned into a werewolf at fifteen, Harry, afraid of what he now is and the lack of control he has, runs from the wizarding world, right into the territory of unmated alpha werewolf Fenrir Greyback, who is overly eager to find the submissive wolf in the heart of his territory. Fenrir/Harry. Mpreg.
