Looking for a dark!Harry/ gray!Harry fics set in a more grim world. Like Blood Crest

I want to see more morally fucked up decisions. While I say dark Harry I am not interested in Lord Slytherin Potter peverell thing. I want to see necromancy, blood magic, soul magic and any kind of dark arts actually used. Shady ingredients for potions being collected and dealt

Any pairing is okay including slash. I just read a Harrymort where Voldemort dealt with a woodswoman with a feral elf who dealt in old magics fueled by blood and bones. Although the fic dealt with time travel mainly, those parts with the woodswoman I liked the most

I want hags of Knockturn Alley actually being terrible like hags, where Knockturn Alley residents will be shady.

Anything that will make Hagrid's blood boil and have potential to make people locked up in Azkaban

Harry getting in Slytherin and hissing snakes to attack someone he dislikes and suddenly being the next big dark thing is not what I am looking for. Some of the stories tagged with dark!Harry is just mild. It is just canon Draco honestly. He takes a shopping trip to Knockturn alley and curses someone in duel and that's it

Bonus points if he is not evil but just gets desensitized to it like Blood Crest. I don't want him to torture Hufflepuffs in for shits and giggles.


** Try antithesis by Oceanbreeze7, it's a WBWL son of Voldy story with the slow and sad descent of Harry into insanity and his transformation from Harry Potter to Hadrian Selwyn, son of Voldemort.

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.

** I recced this fic earlier; it's a darker HP setting. Harry is an adult. He uses a lot of insane magic, and a lot of it is DARK. He's fed up with the BS of the Wizarding world, and he's in destruction mode for most of the fic.

  Harry has reached a very bitter and jaded thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the corruption or pure-blood bigotry one bit. That's when he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of before; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear the system down and salt the earth. And with a double Lordship, he just might have the power to do that.
