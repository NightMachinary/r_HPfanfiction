I have read several fics where Harry gets a letter from the goblins that something is wrong with his account. Many of these letters look surprisingly similar to scam messages. Still all of them are genuine. So I was wondering if there are fics where the message is scam and the goblins just try to rob Harry blind. I don't care whether the goblins succeed or whether Harry picks up the deception. One-shots are okay. Especially interested in the goblin POV.


** Similarly, I wonder if there's a fic where Harry goes to the goblins to remove his horcrux, and he gets an axe to the face.

*** That /would/ be the most reasonable reaction by a Goblin (the guys aren't allowed /wands/, what makes fanfiction writers think they could do such advanced magic as Horcrux-removal when wizards themselves can't really do it?...), and you couldn't entirely blame them, either.

**** Guess I'll be writing it then.

Nice tag! I think you're the person I remember saying that.

  COMPLETE. When Harry is called to Gringotts Bank to meet with the goblin Boneclaw regarding financial matters, things go unexpectedly. Harry is furious. Will Boneclaw come to regret his actions? Goblin bashing. AU after OotP. Oneshot.
