The department of mysteries was, to me, the most intriguing parts of the original books(hence the name, I suppose) and I'd love to read what fans thought of to fill in the blanks of the lore.


** Linkffn(Concentric Wavelengths)

By the author of "The Unforgiving Minute" and "Elizium for Sleepless Souls" (both fantastix fics), Harry's trip to the DoM to rescue Sirius goes very wrong very fast.

It's probably the only fic I know with a non-linear story too, which is really neat.

*** Well, it is linear from Harry's perspective, just not to everyone else.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7860277/1/Chemistry-Timingi][Chemistry and Timing]] is a great Hermione time travel fic where she's an unspeakable. It has one of the best time travel world building I've read (and I've read a lot). Linkffn(7860277)

  She mustn't be seen. It was the oldest rule of time travel yet one of the hardest to follow. Hermione is thrown back to the start of her third year and the professor who'd always been there for her. Now with Sirius escaped from prison and Remus' entire past before him again, can she be there for him? And what happens once the year is over? NOW COMPLETE!
