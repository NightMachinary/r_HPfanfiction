I started listening to Nightvale and I have fallen in love. If there's any crossovers or fics with nightvale vibes, could y'all give them to me? Magic plus Nightvale's eldritch feel would be a wonderful read.


** I have a series of crossovers I am writing with Luna bouncing across realities, but I haven't done the Nightvale one yet. Basically, though, she'll be noping the F out of there.

*** Is it possible to link what you have if you've posted it yet? Luna is one of my favorites. Also happy cake day!!

** Only a Discworld, DCU and a Raven boys in it so far. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7533490]] is the 1st in the series
