Hey guys, I have a question for those people that like reading seven book long next gen fics. Fics like those by Vekin87 and NoahPhantom.

I've just started writing one after fully planning the plot but throughout this process I opted to make my main character a child of Neville Longbottom. There are reasons for this and the plot wouldn't really work with Albus Potter, although he is going to feature just as predominantly as part of the friendship group/classic trio.

My question is, would this turn you off reading the fic if it appeared as though the main character was an OC? I don't really consider them to be an OC because they're Neville's kid and would have grown up closely alongside the Potter-Weasley clan so a lot of their character has obviously been influenced by that. Tbh I actually thought they were a canon character.

I guess I'm just concerned that people will think I'm trying to write myself into the series or something? Idk.

Should I rework my entire plot to have Albus as the main character? If I'm putting in this much time and effort to write a fully planned seven book fanfic, I want people to enjoy reading it with as few barriers as possible! :)

(Also if there is anything you think these style of fanfics typically do wrong, please let me know!)


** Absolutely not. Stick with Neville's Kid as the protagonist.

First of all, the DH epilogue was hardly long or detailed enough to create canon personalities for Harry, Ron and Hermione's kids. We only get the names of the rest of the Weasley clan and Draco's kid, if I recall correctly. Effectively all next-gen kids are OC. While there are fanon characterizations of them, you needn't feel obligated to follow those.

Secondly, this is your story. Generally speaking, you as the fanfic author, are the primary audience for the work. You cannot be compensated for the work as it would violate copyright so you are doing this for your own enjoyment and entertainment. Please yourself with your work primarily and you'll probably find a like-minded audience.

*** Thank you for the advice, this makes me feel much better! So very true about the DH epilogue and about most of them being OCs, I hadn't thought of that before :)

And yes too true, it's definitely more about enjoyment and I think reworking the plot at this point to match the classic next-gen epic style would ruin a lot of the fun for me. Thanks again!!

** As someone who hasn't written jack but loved both Vekin and Noah's series, as well as anything next-gen:

If you're writing in a next-gen setting, you're definitely not writing to try to build up a massive readership, so I wouldn't really worry about the central character not being canon. Canon compliance seems to be pretty much irrelevant when you write next-gen. For me it would actually be refreshing to see a POV of Neville's kid. Would be nice to see an escape from the fanon Alice Longbottom too.

I don't think anyone is going to accuse you of a self-insert, nor do I think switching to Albus's POV is necessary. Albus is practically an OC with how little he appears in canon.

Slide fleshes out some OCs fantastically in the next-gen Stygian Trilogy, which I'd consider one of the really big epic next-gen series (along with Vekin, Noah, Lippert's James Potter series, and maybe the currently updating Fabula Post Bellum). Matt Doyle and Selena Rourke are complete OCs and yet become the series's most memorable characters by the end. It's doable.

Looking forward to reading it, one of my favorite subgenres of fanfic that has some really well-written stories but always seems to be underread. Always love a good next-gen epic!

*** Amazing thank you so much for this advice! Definitely makes me feel like I've made the right decision. I hoped it would be a bit different and unusual while still embodying a lot of the characteristics that we all seem to love in next-gen.

And yes the massive readership is definitely not the goal which is a good point. It's more about getting a story that I've been imagining for years out onto paper and if even a few people can garner some joy from it, then that's a positive!

I'm aiming to completely finish the first one before uploading anything, but I'll be sure to do a little self promotion post when I do so people can give it a read :)
