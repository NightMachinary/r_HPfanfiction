  After the defeat of Voldmort didn't turn out quite like he envisioned, Harry stared into the Abyss preparing to prove something to himself, instead he tumbles into an experience he never expected, and he doesn't go alone.

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1976, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1976

** I don't know the story but since you liked it so much that you are asking for similar ones, then that is a pretty strong recommendation in and of itself so maybe other people would like it too. so why wouldn't you describe the story you liked so much?

in addition maybe someone know a story like the one you you liked but just aren't familiar with it, so you miss out on more recs.
