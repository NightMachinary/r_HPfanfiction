I've got chapter 5 halfway written but I haven't posted anything in a year. I've read over my own story so much that I'm tired of it and not sure if I should even continue it.

  It only takes one strange finding in your mundane routine to change they way your life was headed. Join Harry and Hermione in the summer before 5th year as they hone their skill to battle the forces of Voldemort. AU. Harry fights for independence and political stance. Slow burn h/hr mild bashing of Weasley family. Helpful Sirius, and an original OC that might just have the answers.
