I remember quite a bit about it, I just can't find it again

James forces Lily to give Harry to the Dursley's because twin is boy who lived and possibly is a squib (I think he then obliviates her to forget about Harry), he decides he's going to be the best ever when he gets his letter and goes to hogwarts. A while in I think lily leaves james for what he did and goes by her clan name Soleil which Harry takes too (possible recollection of a sun scar on his chest).

Thanks
