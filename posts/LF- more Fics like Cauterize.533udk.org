Okay, I'm going to say this before continuing: Merlin's balls, that was intense and I loved every single word.. Draco Malfoy's portion.. its...so perfect.

I want more like it. I want intense. I want healing, demons being conquered. I want scars healing in unusual means. I want more like linkffn(4152700)


** You might like [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/dirgewithoutmusic/pseuds/dirgewithoutmusic][dirgewithoutmusic]]'s work. Lots of "what if?"s and character studies. Very poignant! This is my favourite excerpt, from [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2802287][this]] Luna story:

#+begin_quote
  In the spare bedroom at Shell Cottage, Ollivander made Luna a new wand. They hiked, slowly, through windswept bluffs until he found a tree he approved of.

  "Willow?" Dean asked. "Or reed? I mean, it's Luna, she's kinda bendy, isn't she?"

  Ollivander went on Transfiguring his toolset out of bits of driftwood and sea glass. Luna smiled back, wide.

  Bend and bend and never break. She could almost touch the tip of the wand to its hilt, when he was done. Ollivander gave her some oil to rub into it to keep it supple and one day, after the war, Luna curved it into a perfect circle. She held it up to her eye and thought about the last riddle she had ever used to open up Ravenclaw's tower. A circle has no end.

** First, check out all of the other fics by Lady Altair, as quick-hitting poignancy is kinda her shtick.

Next, you might try linkffn(A difference in the Family: the Snape Chronicles by Rannaro). It's Snape-centric, almost an apologist fic but has some keenly human moments particularly in the early stages, before Snape is made a Professor.

If that works for you, you might give a go at linkffn(Amends or Truth and Reconciliation by Vera Rozalsky), though it centers on Hermione and has some very adult themes. The writing style is really something special- moody and immersive, though it play loose with setting the time frame or scene within some passages. Don't think of it as a plot-driven story and you might enjoy it more.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

*** No offense, but reading this i had high hopes that it would be poignant like Cauterize.

It wasn't.

The writing was minimalistic and not very gripping. The decent few (eg. RAB to SOB: "I tried to do what you would have done, in the end") were definitely overshadowed by the disappointing bulk (eg. Bertha Jorkins to Rita Skeeter: "You'll never believe who I met in Albania, Rita!").

Overall it was choppy (each chapter a new one liner) and didn't flow, with unneeded and worthless filler breaking up the few decent lines. Don't expect an emotional ride here folks, as many of the things unsaid were better left that way.

  Every day since his brother has died, his heart has grown a little colder, a little more callous. Soon, he believes, it will be just as cold as the coals of the fire come morning. However, unlike the Gryffindor common room's fire, Dennis doesn't think there'll be someone who comes by once it dies to ignite it back to life. One-shot.
