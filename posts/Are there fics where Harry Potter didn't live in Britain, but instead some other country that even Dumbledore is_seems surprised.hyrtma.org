I mean, there's:

- ( [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-and-the-shipgirls-a-hp-kancolle-snippet-collection.413375/]] ) [ Harry and the Shipgirls ] where Harry lived in Japan because it's the Abyssal War happened, and the Dursleys were caught doing something illegal for the shipgirls to adopt Harry (A confusing moment for me)
- linkao3(15068012) [Child of Azkaban] where Harry grew up in Azkaban because Potters did a spell that transported Harry to Sirius Black (I wanted a Sirius raised Harry)
- linkffn(11567521) [Is Your Great-Aunt an AI? !] where GLaDOS was Harry's "guardian" (abandoned by Petunia) therefore he grew up in Aperture, which is located in USA (sorted through most favorites)
- linkao3(899084; 11083650) [ Chronicles of Valicadia ] where Harry was taken up by a more-hidden magic society due to a message from the future and was enrolled to Skyrim's College of Winterhold (dark Dumbledore ahead)
- linkffn(8724634) [ The Snow Queen ] where fem!Harry transported herself to Panem (I got this fanfic from this subreddit)
- linkffn(13360022) [ Prince of Hogwarts: Year One] where Harry was adopted to another magical family in a Pokemon world (without crossover)

Here's my actual request:

Are there any fics similar to this? More specifically the genre of "Dursleys were deemed unfit by an entity (magical or otherwise) and adopted/moved Harry to a safer place". I like them.

  Being in the middle of a dangerous war meant having to plan ahead for the worst case scenario, as both James and Lily Potter very well knew. And as such, they placed powerful safeguards to ensure their son Harry would grow up with proper guardians should anything happen to them. ...in their defence, neither of them would have ever expected what would happen to one Sirius Black after their deaths.

  Harry died. Voldemort won. The world burned. A foreign magical nation sends a message into the past to rewrite the future. However, meddling with time always has consequences. AU, multi-xover. Contains SLASH. Evil!Dumbledore! independent!powerful!dark!Harry! Eventual Harry x M!dragonborn. And of course, Harry raised very differently!

  Harry and Mazhe have both fulfilled their destinies, but they are about to find out, fate is far from done with them. A terrible ancient prophecy looms in the background, and dark forces threaten to bring about the end of the world... with both young mages caught in middle. Picks up where 'Orb of Magnus' left off. AU, multi-xover. Contains SLASH. This story is not for Dumbledore fans. independent!powerful!dark!Harry! Harry x M!dragonborn.

  Petunia sends a baby Harry to her aunt, living in America, Caroline Evans. Some years later, Caroline becomes GLaDOS, and only Harry stops her from her rampage. Now, Harry is eleven, and he's heading to Hogwarts. Of course, with an amoral scientist/computer for a great-aunt and a mute big sister, the question is not whether he is ready for Hogwarts. Is Hogwarts ready for him?

  Rose Potter disappeared at the age of six. In Hermione Granger's sixth year, the Goblet of Fire summons a girl trained to be the champion of a very different kind of game. They wanted a saviour. They got the Snow Queen.

  Harry Potter was taken from the Dursleys' doorstep as a baby by someone who could also handle children with accidental magic like wizarding families, but in a much different way. Raised and educated by people some call royalty and some call assassins, Harry takes to the world differently and is equipped with other ways and means to fight and knowledge of getting what he wants.
