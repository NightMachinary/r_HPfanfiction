** RIP Helen MCCroy.

I really loved how she played the role of Narcissa Malfoy. I loved how she lied to Voldemort's face in the forest, her choosing Draco over her husband (that's how it looked to me) and Dark Lord's followers and leaving Hogwarts during the last battle of Hogwarts was extremely impressive and awesome. She was someone not be messed with, especially as a mother.

** Oh, how sad! She was great as Narcissa. I didn't know she was married to Damian Lewis. The article says they have teenaged children, how sad for them to lose their mother.
