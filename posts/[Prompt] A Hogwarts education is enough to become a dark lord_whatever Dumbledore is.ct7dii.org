This is a joke prompt. No flaming please!

I'm not calling Dumbledore a dark lord in the prompt, just really skilled at magic.


** So a average student can be considered the best wizard of a generation... so an above average student... SHOUT IT FROM THE ROOFTOPS! JAKKY FINALLY ADMITTED WHAT WE ALL KNOW, HERMIONE IS SMARTER THAN DUMBLEDORE!!!.... *cough cough*

Ok, now that that nonsense is out of my system, it would be interesting to see the defense syllabus, "Ok class, I am going to show you (so you can "avoid" doing it) how to split your soul to acomplish immortality."

"Remember class, tomorrow we are going over the wand movements for the unforgivables so you know what not to do."

*** But seriously though, Voldemort found the book with instructions to make a Horcrux in the freaking Hogwarts library. This actually isn't too far off from canon.

**** We are never told exactly where Voldemort learnt how to make Horcrux's. The book Hermione takes from Dumbledore's office explicitly fails to mention how exactly to make them, doesn't it? Only mention what they are and the properties they have.

***** Secrets of the darkest arts had the information and was in the restricted section until Dumbledore removed it.

While it isn't explicitly stated that Voldemort learned to make Horcruxes from that book, it is speculated in book by various characters.

Plus it is the simplest explanation.

*** I'll only accept that joke because you're actually reasonable. (I still maintain I'd have no issues with book Hermione if the narrative treated more her like Ron and Harry.) Actually Hermione's character made me think of the prompt. Where did she learn how to confund people?

Seriously though, they have no stated post Hogwarts education. And Crouch-Moody totally demonstrated the curses/gave tips on how to cast them (unintentionally).

Honestly, It's Hermione, she found it in a book. The question is which book.

/17 Spells not for use on Broomriders/?

/Eight Spells for Advancing the Plot/?

/10 Spells to Dull Your Mind so Bad Romantic Subplots can Happen/?
