I'm looking for a specific fic and also just any good Harry/Ginny soul bond fics.

The fic that I'm looking for, I think Harry and Ginny were in a soul bond and Hermione gets suspicious and trys to use dark magic to win Harry over(?), that might not be in it, but she definitely gets pulled out of Hogwarts due to medical concerns from using Dark Magic.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4545504/1/Aspirations][Aspirations]]? - Harry and Ginny aren't in a soul bond but they're together, Hermione abuses dark magic but withdraws herself eventually. linkffn(4545504)

  AU. Harry is shunned not only Ron, but Hermione as well after the Goblet of Fire incident. Ginny befriends Harry and history changes. Future Dark!Harry Dark!Ginny pairing, extended summary inside. Note from 2012: I'm not a huge fan of this story now, but leaving it up for historical purposes for those who do enjoy it.

*** It might be, tbh, I don't remember ever reading this but it looks good. If it turns out it's not, thanks for the fic!

**** Can confirm that there isn't a soul bond, but yeah this is the only one I can think of that fits the Hermione part of your request perfectly.
