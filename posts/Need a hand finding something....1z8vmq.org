I read a fanfic a long time ago that starts out after Harry has defeated Voldemort, but pretty much everyone important to him died. He dyes his hair, gets some tattoos, and goes back to the Marauder era. Once there, he changes his name and befriends them. The story follows school and then after, there is a slash relationship between Harry and Sirius. Harry is very gray! in this one and it ends with Sirius having to kill him because he's about to become a dark lord. I read it on fanfiction.net, and I'm fairly sure it was rated M. Any help would be awsome, thanks.
