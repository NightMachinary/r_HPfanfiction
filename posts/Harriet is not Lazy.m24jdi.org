As the tittle says. I've seen many posts about how much they hate the name Harriet and what little thought the author put on the name but I don't think it's lack of effort at all.

Naming fem!Harry Harriet is not lazy, it's obviously an excuse to keep calling her Harry trhoug the fic and this is a choice that works for characterization. It's much easier to think that the character is still Harry if they share name than if it's something completely different.

Calling the ML Harry, of course, it's only useful when you are writing Harry and not a complete OC which is the case with a lot of fics that don't care about keeping in character

Whether you personally like that name or not I believe it's a perfectly good choice and I prefer my fem!Harry fics to be name Harriet and be called Harry.

I think it's a much better option than naming her something outrageous like Orchid Potter. That's just overthinking and obvious way too much effort.

Also the naming them like flowers is fine and all but there are no real indicators about this fanon tradition of the Evans family. And since I like Lily as her middle name having two flower names is a bit too much.

Also I would like to point out that the name is secondary to the story and I would read an Orchid Potter story so long as the story is good.

Edit: Merlin, people will downvote anything in this sub.


** Realistically, most people, when choosing baby names, won't say something like "Harry if it's a boy, and Harriet if it's a girl." Instead, they'll have completely different lists for boys and girls, even when a name has a common counterpart for the other gender. There are plenty of exceptions, of course, and there's always the possibility that someone messed up the gender-reveal charm and they didn't have time to think up a new name. But as a general rule, it's probably more likely that Lily and James wouldn't have named their daughter Harriet.

But with all that being said, I like Harriet as a name more than most of the flower names people throw around. She is still just a female version of Harry, so Harriet fits as a name.

*** I see what you mean about the baby names and I agree it's unrealistic in that scenario but the point is exactly that she is just a female version of Harry. So yeah Harriet.

** For me, the whole point of Harry being named 'Harry' was in its simplicity and commonality. He was "just Harry." So I transfer that over to "Harriet." It's not overly pretty or unique, a bit old-fashioned, a name for someone who is "just Harriet."

I don't mind some of the simpler flower names, but stuff like Ianthe or Celadine or Amaranth kind of defeat the purpose of Harry not having a special, "epic" name.

*** Yes, this is another good point.

"Just Orchid" doesn't sound right.

I haven't come across any Celandine or Amaranth but those names always make me think that the author is announcing: this is a super special OC not to be confused with just Harry.

** I agree. I've gotten into fem-Harry fics recently, but it only works for me if she's called Harry. Once I'm reading about "Jasmine" or "Rose" I can't convince my brain that it's the same character.

There's a bunch of fics I need to download to do a search and replace, because they look really promising but I can't get past the name thing.

Even in Prince of Slytherin, when he's doing "Hadrian" thing, I need to remind myself, "he's acting! This is a role!" Mercifully those bits tend to be short.

** My fem!harry is called Hannah üò§

I actually have a bit of fun with the picking a female name thing in one of my earlier chapters.

I don't think there's anything wrong with Harriet, either.

I guess it could be seen as lazier because you don't need to change your headspace as much or can borrow more from canon sources, but I don't think that's why most people choose it.

Sometimes people do run off with certain themes a bit to far for names.

Orchid for example is rarely ever used as a flower name, Petunia and Lily are actually flowers and names, Violet or Rose would be a better option imo.

But yeah, like you story > names

** Given that in vast, vast majority, she is has nothing in common with Harry Potter except maybe the circumstances of her birth, she might as well be named "Joanne".
