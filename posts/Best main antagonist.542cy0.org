What's the best main antagonist you've seen in a fanfic? It can be a canon one or OC.


** Draco Malfoy in [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?chapno=1&storyid=619][After the End]].

Very human motives. His father is killed by the defendants in the final battle, and he feels obligated to seek revenge for that. Yet he kinda loved and hated his father at the same time, and a part of him is relieved that Voldemort lost and his father's dead, and... it's complicated.

He has just the right amount of relatibility, cowardice, cunning and despicability to be the perfect antagonist.
