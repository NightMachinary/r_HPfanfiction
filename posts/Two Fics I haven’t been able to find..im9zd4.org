:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I have two fics that I've been trying to find for a couple weeks and having no luck. Both fit the whole, “trained by the founders” or “founder's heir“ category if that helps.

For one I remember that Harry revives after dying and is repeatedly pushed off of the rafters by a founds. I think he later showed Hermione flagstones or something like that to convince her he was the “Fith Founder”.

The other has a founder's heir school-like-thing where the founders somehow train all of their heirs through time travel. Harry and Dumbledore attend at the same age (I think) and the fic starts with Harry coming back during a feast and Dumbledore saying something like “it's not your time.

A preemptive thank you to any who help.
