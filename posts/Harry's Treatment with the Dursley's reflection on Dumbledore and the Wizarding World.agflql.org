  Regardless of all that: if the reasoning behind the hatred/dislike/disdain for Dumbledore is that Harry was treated poorly and he didn't do anything to stop it, then why do we not blame the Wizarding world as a whole for not intervening in the world's problems?
#+end_quote

That makes absolutely no sense. Dumbledore is directly responsible for Harry, he is basically kidnapping the kid and on his own perogative handing it to unvetted foster parents, without any government involvement.

No one is asking for Dumbledore to help protect random orphans from abuse all across England just because he could.

But yeah the wizarding world not providing magical help in situations where they easily could make a difference is a pretty bad looking situation.

*** So maybe the issue we should have with Dumbledore is that he got involved with Harry's life in the first place? I mean, he had no legal or moral obligation to involve himself, right? And if he has a moral obligation to step in and involve himself with one orphan, why not more?

**** Because:

A- He knew Harry and his parents personally.

B- He had a vested interest in Harry's life because of the prophecy

C- He was directly involved in Harry's situation, what with the war and having been the one to cast the Fidelius

So that is 3 reasons VERY OBVIOUS why Harry wasn't just some random orphan to him and your comparison doesn't work at all.

I don't think you gave this as much thought as you think you did, mate. This is not the moral connundrum that you are making it out to be.

  should we equally hate all of the Wizarding world for their allowance of atrocities that could be easily prevented by them?
#+end_quote

Well, there's the statute of secrecy to consider. But also,

Why are /you/ not volunteering all your spare income/time in helping others? You could easily prevent so much loss of life.

The truth is, humans are predisposed (perhaps genetically) to really care for a very limited number of people. Caring for more would be paralyzing and basically make an individual unable to cope with life.

*** For the sake of not being one of "those people" on Reddit, I won't go into why the "well why aren't you doing XYZ" argument doesn't apply to me (rather, it does, and my wife and I have done and given more than about 99% of people, but it's a discussion about fanfic, and really not the point.)

And for many reasons, I disagree with the argument we can only care for so many. I'd counter that the more we care for, the more enriched and worthwhile our lives become.

Regardless of real-world stuff, my argument would be that right and wrong in this situation is not relative. Either Dumbledore has an obligation to all random orphans, or he has an obligation to none. Same with society. I'd argue there's an obligation to all by the whole society, and the lack of help, or even interest, is rather condemning.

** I believe that in the first book Hagrid mentions that the reason reason magical's hide is that they don't want to to be bothered by muggles asking for magical solutions to problems.

This might be something wizards tell children to avoid more complex topics, sort of like how children are supposedly delivered by storks, but it does display a culture of entitlement. It also fits with the wizard ideal of being self sufficient having mastered sufficient, the first task and the Triwizard Tournament as a whole are perfect examples of that belief.

** The thing is that Muggles number into the billions, while wizards are a rather small population. I don't know if there's ever a mentioned general number of wizards, but I've seen one fic that described wizarding politics as "small town politics" and I'd say that's a good representation.

In order for wizards to actually help out the Muggle world with its problems, sickness, poverty, disease, whatever, they'd have to dedicate basically the entire lives of a majority of their population to solely that. Wizards would turn into public servants simply due to their birth. They'd have to abandon their own society's goals and ambitions to spend their time in hospitals or making potions or whatnot.

Wizards have their own lives, goals, and things to do. Sure they have the potential to help lots of people, but so does everyone. It's not fair to expect everyone to dedicate their lives to other people just because they have the capacity.

It isn't just this. There's also the number of shenanigans that Albus gets up to in Harry's years at Hogwarts, all of which paint a very bad picture.

Then, there's Albus' treatment of Sirius. For someone who claims to preach love, second chances, redemption and all that rot, Albus does not give Sirius even a chance to explain himself in 1981 and testifies against him, after which he cuts all contact. That's either incredibly OOC for Albus, or something considerably uglier. If you were to consider that Sirius was supposed to be Harry's guardian in the event of James and Lily's deaths, it is very convenient that Sirius gets imprisoned with a very speedy sentencing.

*** The bigger failure regarding Sirius is 1994, where he does instruct two teenagers to break countless laws because he is unwilling to save the innocent himself.

Sirius mutterings in 81 can be seen as a confession and while that doesn't make it right, it is at least a believable excuse. Dumbledore doesn't have the same excuse in 94.

  Sirius mutterings
#+end_quote

The mutterings about "He's at Hogwarts," happen in 1993, long after Sirius has been imprisoned and presumably after he sees Peter on the newspaper.

And yes, the instructing two teenagers to do a time travel instead of doing it himself do count as Albus' games.

****** I'm not sure he says anything. He stands at the scene and when the officials from the Ministry arrive, they find him laughing. I don't think there is a verbal admission of guilt to anyone at that moment.

Even so, "It's all my fault!" is not a line you'd expect the supposed second hand of Voldemort to be shrieking. Especially not the fault part.

******* The original case against Sirius is very cut and dry as both Remus and Dumbledore still thought he was the secret keeper. While there wasn't a trial, the books do mention an investigation and frankly, Sirius most likely would have been thrown in Azkaban even with a trial.

There is a thing called closure, and for someone who claims emotions like love and remorse are powerful things every now and then, the fact that he did not speak even once to Sirius after the 1981 is incredibly suspicious.

He decides to "forgive" Snape of his various crimes after one conversation (just one!) where Snape says he'd been lusting after Lily, but decides not to speak with Sirius at all, a man who he'd been working and fighting with for three years. He throws away three years of camaraderie and seven years of a student-teacher relationship like nothing.
