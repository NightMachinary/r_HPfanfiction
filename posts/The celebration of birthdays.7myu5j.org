Can you justify in canon that wizards do not celebrate birthdays (except as some consciously muggle import), or that maybe they only celebrate the highly significant birthdays, such as the 17th?

Bonus if you know any fics that explore this idea.


** Well for starters, Harry regularly receives birthday gifts from Hagrid, Ron, and Sirius, all of whom are wizards, with the latter two also being purebloods.

Harry is stated to be celebrating his 16th birthday at the Burrow when various people relay news of disappearances (Fortescue, Ollivander) and deaths (Karkaroff).

Nicholas Flamel was mentioned as having recently "celebrated his 665th birthday" in PS.

So no, I'd say you can't really justify that from canon.

*** Yes, and we have to keep in mind that we really are only going to hear about birthdays when pertained to Harry because of the limited POV we have in the series.

To add on: we also read about Ron eating the spiked love potion chocolate cake on his birthday AND receiving the golden watch from his parents (Half Blood Prince). So, yes, we can assume, based off canon, that birthdays are as important in the wizarding world as they are in the muggle world. Maybe we don't get to see parties and all because they're at a boarding school, so throwing a big shindig isn't possible, but we do know that they do the cake and gift thing.

That's the bit that seems like evidence, to me, that would take serious explanation if you wanted to go down this route. Although, isn't it Ron's 17th? That could be something wizards celebrate, without celebrating most other birthdays.

Presents to Harry from sympathetic muggle-loving wizards /could/ be explained as them knowing it's a muggle custom that he would be familiar with.
