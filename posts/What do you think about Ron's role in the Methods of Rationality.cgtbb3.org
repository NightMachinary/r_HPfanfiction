I have enjoyed reading the first book of the Methods of Rationality. It differs from the original book in some fundamental ways but I simply found many of the ideas very interesting. Talking about difference, in this book Ron seems to be a minor character. The 'smart' Harry Potter talks to him, somehow concludes Ron is not very bright and decides not to pay much attention to him. What do you think about this attitude? Does it change in the other books of the series?


** It does not really change; Ron comes back in a minor role in the "defence games" storyline, but Harry never really changes his opinion of him. There's some suggestion that he /was/, if not factually wrong, then at least unreasonably dismissive. But he doesn't actually change his mind himself.

I think it was a bit of a lazy shortcut by the author, but it is true that the difference in intelligence and preoccupations between the story's Harry and this canon-like Ron would have made their still becoming friends implausible. It is not indended, at any rate, as a knock on Ron's character, and AFAIR it doesn't come across as such; it's just that Ron is a very ordinary teenager with very ordinary teenage interests, and so irrelevant to /HPMoR/'s themes and appeals. It's not so much that Harry misjudges Ron's intelligence unfavorably as that he realizes that Ron's favorite thing is to talk about Quidditch, and realizes that he cannot possibly be friends with a person who takes Quidditch even remotely seriously.

** HPMOR isn't really a series. It's a single fic that covers the AU events of year one.

Harry's opinion of Ron stays mostly consistent, but later on in the fic Ron does get a moment to shine which proves that Harry's dismissive attitude was a big mistake. That's one of the important parts of the fic: Harry realizing that his own biases cause him to fail and lead to disaster.

** I've heard that Yudkowski intended HPMoR to be something of a commentary on the state of the fanfic community, hence the court scenes, the Ancient and Most Noble Houses, the idea that Dumbledore is responsible for Harry's finances, Silly!Luna, rage about the Snitch, Harry and Malfoy being friends, Harmony as a destined romance that everyone supports, Gryffindors being bullies, Houses being super important and people regularly referring to others as Lions or having Slytherin cunning, etc.

In that regard, Harry taking a moment to get to know Ron before dismissing him as a rude braggart with nothing to offer is a pretty accurate representation of the fandom at large.

It's also a fair estimation of Harry's character - Ron in canon is the binding emotional force between two very troubled, abrasive personalities. He is the one most grounded in having a normal life while enjoying normal adolescent things. HPEV (Those are the correct initials, right?) dismisses him because he has no interest in that, which is treated as a flaw on his part that Hermione alone can't fix, as she has only a limited interest in those things herself. She's not anchored enough in normality to keep Harry there, so he goes off the deep end. Hermione later feels overwhelming pressure when she realizes she's the only not-evil friend Harry has.

HPMoR Ron is also more talented than he first appears, as per canon, which Harry is pathologically unable to accept because he doesn't have 'I am super smart you guys' as his sole defining personality trait, the way Harry and all the people he considers friends do.

I am going off distant memory here, but didn't Yudkowski not actually read past the first book or two when writing HPMOR and base his understanding of Potterverse on fanfic with occasional Wiki lookup? Fanon contamination strikes me as more likely than some subtle deliberate satire.

**** Calling it fanon contamination would be inaccurate in this case, because that implies going against canon by accident. EY has said that he deliberately wrote the story to be set in the world of Harry Potter /fanfiction/. This is apparent in the fic if you look at all the in-jokes which poke fun at common fanfiction tropes.

**** Ah, yes, because if two people set out with goals that can be described in similar terms, then /obviously/ they must be similar people and have achieved similar results. Right?

Like, Harry fights Voldemort because he doesn't want to be killed, and Voldemort's whole shtick is not wanting to die, so obviously their character arcs are the same.

And Tom Riddle set out to collect a bunch of famous artefacts, while Slughorn made it his life's work to collect famous people, so clearly Slughorn is like Voldemort too, and canon ended with the Slug Club being depopulated before Slughorn himself was toppled.

And Dumbledore is the same as Voldemort because they both tried and failed to become the master of death, and Romilda Vane is like Voldemort because she has an unhealthy interest in Harry and harms the people around Harry when she targets him, and Ron is like Voldemort because he wants to stand out and make a name for himself, and Cedric Diggory is like Voldemort because he's good at everything, and basically everyone is Voldemort.

*** OP is misrepresenting quite what HPMOR says on the matter; it's not that Harry perceives Ron as stupid, but simply that he reckons him to be of average intelligence (as far as we know, true) and, more to the point, a very average /teenager/ in terms of his mindset and interest.

In practice, this means that Ron rants to him about Quidditch in /lieu/ of having a conversation, and Harry, who thinks Quidditch as a whole is stupid and so is taking it remotely seriously, concludes that there's very few chances of his and a devoted Quidditch fan becoming friends.

**** To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical reader's head. There's also Quirrell's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike HPMoR truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in HPJEV's existential catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Yudkowski's genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a HPMoR tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎
