** I'm now picturing Remus asking Kevin Costner if he is in heaven to which Kevin replies "no, this is Iowa."

Kevin then asks him if he wants to have a catch and Remus proceeds to tell him he isn't a big fan of Quidditch.

*** Nice. See I live in Iowa and I'm not sure people are aware but Midwesterners are typically very nice and helping. very different from where I lived before coming here. I can just imagine a makes Remus asking for help from a sweet lady feeding her cows and she just goes "Kids pranks these days. I swear!"
