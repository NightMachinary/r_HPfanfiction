** A side one to that would be Ron agrees with him in GoF whilst Hermione says he cheated.

*** I'm confused by this. When would this take place? Since they have the locket, this would have been after the Ministry, which means that they all know that the Ministry has been thoroughly taken over and is hunting Muggleborns.

Why is Hermione expecting the aurors to help? And, why is Harry's best counterargument Stan Shunpike, rather than the fact that Voldemort had taken over the Ministry?
