I love fan fiction and I love Harry Potter but for some reason, I can't get myself to read golden trio age fan fiction. I think I like the original books so much that I can't imagine things going differently for the golden trio. So the way I reconcile that is by shipping Rose/Scorpius. Does anyone have any recommendations? Either for REALLY good Golden Trio fanfiction that might change my mind or for Scorose. Thanks!


** I'm the opposite - I haven't read a single next-gen story, and only am interested in Harry-centric fics. That's what makes fanfiction so great, though - there's something for everyone.

*** Of course, theres DEFINITELY something for everyone! I'm definitely not saying GT-era fics and their readers are bad or anything haha. I'm actually bummed that I'm missing out on so much good writing. But I will say, I found a Ginny-centric fic recently via this sub where she was sorted into slytherin and its really good! So maybe that'll be my stepping stone to a broader range of fanfiction :)

** While I love the books, there are enough plot issues in canon for me to not enjoy next gen fiction, and Cursed Child just obliterated what little interest I had in it. A major down point is that Ginny was not developed well enough as a character for me to enjoy that pairing, but I also am not a fan of Harmony which is the most common alternative.

*** Fair enough. I've read and seen cursed child and I hate the story immensely. But Ive shipped rose/Scorpius since the day the last book was released, mostly because I like the idea of dramione but it's non canon enough that I feel like I can't suspend my disbelief enough to really get into it. Plus Rose and Scorpius was heavily hinted in book 7 which helps. Potentially dumb question but I've never heard of Harmony, can you give me a rundown?

**** Yeah, Cursed Child was a bit of a slap in the face. There are next-Gen fanfics out there that were a lot better written and fit in better with the HP canon. I never bothered to read it. I don't mind the DracoxHermione pairing, I just don't read a lot of Hermione centered fics.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4828161/1/][Our Little Secret by Kerichi]] Pretty good Rose/Scorpius fic that avoids /most/ of the annoying tropes of the pairing. Importantly, Draco and Lucius are fairly in character which is nice. A great author in general tbh. It's the beginning of a trilogy and has a ton of spin-off one-shots that are good, but stands entirely on its own. I'm a big fan of the one-shot [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11320678/1/][Mastermind vs LaVeela]], but it doesn't really make sense without the main story.

** I have zero emotional attachment to next-gen.

They are all OCs anyway, and writing decent OCs is very hard.

But I can understand people have different tastes.

As the OP wants good Trio centric fics, here are my recommendations:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), is IMHO the best by far in this category.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994): Harry and Ron are sticking with Hermione despite her committing some serious killings.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][Forging the Sword]], linkffn(3557725): Superb Trio fic that has been unfortunately abandoned.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Walked-on-Water][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water]], linkffn(12076771): They are actually in a romantic relationship, and hand to fend off attacks by zombie battleship BismarckMort.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: This fic is set in a non-magic sci-fi AU. If you can get past that, you will find it a great read. The Trio is freaking awesome here.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6807742/1/Just-The-Three-of-Them][Just The Three of Them]], linkffn(6807742): A cute one shot canon rehash with them in a real relationship.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4778694/1/To-End-In-Serenity][To End in Serenity]], linkffn(4778694): The Trio relationship is well written in this time travel, but Dumbledore and Snape bashing is way overdone.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7405516/1/We-are-the-Golden-Trio][We are the Golden Trio!]], linkffn(7405516): Great plot and Trio interaction, bad grammar and spelling.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** It's funny that you feel this way, because I'm the exact opposite. I've only read and enjoyed more general next generation stories (like Inter Arma and Hogwarts Houses Divided). There aren't too many quality fics that I've found so I tend to stay clear of them in general.

I tend to stray for more post-epilogue fics rather than next gen. Pretty much all of Northumbria's works (which I guess is technically next gen. but it's my head canon of post-DH) are brilliant. They give such a color to so many canon characters post-war in a very realistic way. And it completely ignores Cursed Child, because many of the stories were written pre-Cursed Child. God Cursed Child sucked.

But I also got into fan fiction through my interest in Dramione, so I started out reading fan fiction with very AU fics. If it's not something you're into, I don't necessarily think you're missing out on anything special. I'd say the best works are the general stories that do stray into canon territory but make their own world.
