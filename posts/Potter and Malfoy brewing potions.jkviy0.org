I remember reading some fic where Harry and Draco became friends after something and start brewing potions in Room of Requirement. I think they later sell those potions to others. There were also night classes, and quiet commonly people were part creatures, tho there was some discrimination against them. I think it was dropped and that it was on ao3 but I can't find it in my bookmarks (maybe I'm just blind)

I quiet liked it even tho it was dropped, so if someone can help find it, it would be great

Edit: so I found it while looking for something else [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4566726/chapters/10398528]] (11chapters)
