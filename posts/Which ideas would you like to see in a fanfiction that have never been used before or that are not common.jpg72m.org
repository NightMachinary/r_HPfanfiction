Well, the topic of my discussion is literally the title.

I have read so many fanfictions that sometimes I have the feeling that I'm reading the same fanfiction multiple times. You know what I mean? Like, there are so many tropes that have been used over and over again, that some times I think there's no innovation. And although I like some of them, I would like to see different ideas or, maybe (a huge maybe), even write about something.

Therefore, I'm asking you guys to give me ideas and suggestion about fanfiction ideas that are not so common and how they would affect cannon. For example: having a fanfiction in which Harry has a brother is relatively common (shout out to WBWL creators). However, I don't remember reading one in which he has a good relationship with his brother, or, in which they grew up together (like at the Dursleys). And I would really like to see an older brother Harry or a Harry that wasn't alone during his childhood (doesn't matter if it's a older/younger sibling or a twin). Oh, and yes, I have already read Harry Potter and The Boy Who Lived.

Another example: I have never seen a fanfiction in which Sirius, has a child (like his own child, not blood adopted Harry) and this child is friends with Harry since year one. I don't know, maybe there wouldn't be much of plot, but I like the idea of James' and Sirius' kids studying together and having the same sort of friendship their fathers had.

Either way, I really hope you guys could give me your ideas, suggestions, theories and whatever you want to share. Although I really beg for you guys to keep the ideas without crossover.

Thanks for reading this!

(Please ignore any grammar and English mistakes, as English is not my first language.)


** I've got a whole pile:

1. Trelawney is deliberately teaching Divination poorly, with the intent of lessening people's belief in Seers and thus helping protect those that truly have the Gift. She herself is a gifted Seer, but the constant influx of what-may-be is just too overwhelming, so she drinks to keep her inner eye closed.
2. After the Second Blood War, Harry and one or more friends/lovers decide that they need to take over Wizarding Britain themselves, not just to fix its incredibly broken government and society, but also to act of custodians for a population that is so supremely credulous and easily-led.
3. House-Elves are especially sensitive to chemicals (see Winky getting drunk on butterbeer). Dobby is already a hyper little guy. Fred and George give him espresso.
4. Phoenixes are born not of other phoenixes, but when a magical being of extraordinary character and purity of heart dies. The Order of the Phoenix is (unbeknownst to any but its founder) named not for Fawkes, but for Dumbledore, who has convinced himself that he'll become a phoenix. For decades, being reborn as a phoenix has been one of his main goals, though he also tries to encourage others to behavior that he believes would help them towards a phoenix rebirth. This is also why he has no fear of death - he honestly expects it to turn him into a phoenix - and why he seems so intent on reforming everyone: He both wants to give them a chance at phoenix rebirth, and considers redeeming evil people "light" and thus part of his journey to becoming a phoenix himself.
5. Harry gets access to the memories in his scarcrux, and development of Occlumency allows him to access his own early memories. He's aware of how things were at the end of the last war, and is uncertain about whether to even bother with Wizarding Britain. He decides to attend Hogwarts, at least for his first year, to get a feel for how Wizarding Britain responded to Voldemort's defeat, and whether it's worth fighting for when Voldemort returns.
6. Merope Gaunt's personal Hell is spending eternity fruitlessly trying to soothe the pain of the eight mutilated fragments of her beloved son's soul.
7. Pure gold can reflect the Killing Curse. This idea is based on the bit in canon where Voldemort's AK bounces off the piece of golden statue and wrecks the security desk. It also fits with the reason a Philosopher's Stone can both grant immortality and turn other metals into gold (too long to fit here).

That's just the few I had handy. A more exhaustive listing can be found [[https://www.fanfiction.net/topic/88470/161519235/1/A-Bunch-of-Prompts-and-some-random-plot-elements][here]].

*** So the reason Trelawny made a prophecy at her interview and when she did the exams in 3rd year is because those were both occasions she knew she had to sober up for, noone's hiring a drunk and there'd be a whole lot of outcry if she didn't run exams properly.

** Sci fi, with magic taken to it's logical conclusion.

Now, before you say "logical conclusion with magic, are you stupid?". What I'm looking for, is the setting to be taken to it's logical conclusion, not magic itself.

If you need a frame of reference. Something similar to "To the Stars" is what I want. I know Darth Marrs does sci fi stuff. It just doesn't scratch that exact itch.

So please, any decent author, throw me a bone!

** 1) A fic about professional Quidditch.

2) An OC magic-school fic set in a country that is not Britain or America. (There's Marissa and the Wizards, but that's been deleted).

3) A fic exploring the magical lower classes; e.g. a Harry who finds himself in a working-class wizarding family and cannot afford to attend Hogwarts. (Only works with the not-everyone-goes-to-Hogwarts model).

4) More fics like Slide's Anguis series, exploring the larger British Wizarding community's lives during either the first or second war.

*** As far as the lower classes idea, there's a story on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] called Self Made Man, by Hecateslover (I won't link because it's rated M for teen BDSM), in which Harry finds out he's spent too much from his trust vault, his father spent the family fortune on the war, and Sirius left him the remaining 17 galleons of the Black fortune, so he has to drop out of Hogwarts and find some way of making money.

There's also a series of chapters in someone's one-shots and ideas file (I don't remember whose, unfortunately), in which Harry, during his summer in Diagon Alley, becomes an assistant Ministry inspector (a ploy by a lazy inspector), and learns from the various businesses he inspects. One of them tells Harry that Hogwarts is where the upper classes go, and everyone else has to learn on their own, and it would be educational for Harry to learn about the people he might someday be making decisions about.

*** There's a fic called "Harry Potter, Rise from Dust", which is not exactly about professional Quidditch, but Harry does start to play professional Quidditch at some point and it shows the training, the games, etc.

Now, about the other ones, I've never seen anything like it. I'd like to see number 3 happening.

** Not sure if it fits, especially with the "no crossover" bit, but the whole Battle Royal genre missed the HP fandom. (There might have been some crossovers, but I'm not really a crossover guy either.)

I'm talking about ideas like Voldemort winning and instead of outright killing muggleborns, why not peg them against each other in a deadly battle, to entertain... And /maybe/ one of them can survive... Orphaned Harry can be easily tied into such a story... (Perfect for Harmony /s)

** I've got a couple of ideas which I have, at various times, tried to write and abandoned which are... more unusual.

1. Albus and Delphi really did have a thing and went all the way... Delphi gives birth in Azkaban and doesn't say who the father is before dying Merope style (i.e. she names the kids). Also,all the Potters have an identity crisis when they realise they probably communicate with each other in Parseltongue. There's also a whole teen pregnancy side plot with Rose for some reason.
2. Harry never went to Hogwarts or learnt magic at all so his relationship with the Dursleys improved after he turned 11. One day whilst Christmas shopping, Dudley buys Harry a statuette because it has red hair ("like his mum"). The statuette turns out to be Ginny... which Harry discovers when he touches it. Unfortunately, Dudley accidentally broke Ginny's hand off so she immediately starts bleeding all over the place... (Ginny was accidentally turned into a statue because this was the best way of defeating Voldemort without Harry's being around... sort of friendly fire type deal). [[https://medium.com/@Frameworkisdigimon/the-pied-man-great-whinging-police-station-a027d636774c][I've put part of this concept online.]]
3. Harry becomes obsessed with telling Ginny muggle fairy tales while they wait for James to be born. Unfortunately, Ron buys them a cursed muggle fairytale book so they get sucked into a fairytale world. Also, everyone believes they're dead because Ron inherits Kreacher. It's a one way trip.
4. Sirius really was the secret keeper. He got drunk and told a random muggle backpacker where the Potters lived but blew himself up when Voldemort came knocking ([[https://medium.com/@Frameworkisdigimon/secret-kept-secret-lost-410bcc2cb21f][this part I've actually written]]). The Potters have been stuck inside ever since. Also, there are now eight of them so there are more people to talk too... but Harry's turning eleven...

I should also mention the... [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/j93hx8/scabbers_isnt_peter_pettigrew_hes_james_potter/][Scabbers is James concept]]. Someone did a great workthrough of that in the comments.

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.
