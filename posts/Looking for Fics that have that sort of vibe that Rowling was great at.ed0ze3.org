I understand that fanfiction will be missing something, rather the way characters interact, plot points, or something, but I'm just looking for any stories that are very close to that Rowling vibe.

It can be as canon as possible or as AU as possible.

I'd rather NOT have Dumbledore and/or Weasley bashing

I'd rather NOT have Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione

Other then that, I'm okay with other pairings

It can be ANY Era.


** This is a great thread and I hope you get some recs. Good AUs and other twists on canon are always fun, but the magic of Harry Potter was always in Hogwarts itself so I love a good story that manages to capture that feel.

I think this is one of the best canon compliant stories out there. Shame the author never wrote much more.

Melindaleo is alright but her writing is a bit amateurish (not to mention sappy).

kb0 was popular among certain subsets and I like some of his stuff but he always tries to run with a certain "twist" so his stories are a bit hit or miss for me.

** Weasley Girl by Hyaroo for sure. It's a trilogy with side stories, with two of the books complete. It starts off with only one real change (Ron being a girl) and then ends up completely accelerating past the canon stations. It has great character development with no romance atm. Ronnie was revealed to be a lesbian and thinks Luna is pretty, but that's literally it.
