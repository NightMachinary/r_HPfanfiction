Considering that the Muggleborn question was the reason for Slytherin leaving, it stands to reason that the other three founders would not endorse his stance. And if the Sorting Hat reflects that, all children who adopted pureblood supremacy from their parent's knee would end up in Slytherin by being barred from the other three.

And of the Slytherin traits, most are quite difficult to find in children. Most have dreams (eg become an astronaut), but few have true ambition outside of the academic ones (which place you in Ravenclaw). Cunning likewise takes a bit of experience since most children are rather un-cunning, despite their belief of the contrary. Loyalty can be easily found amongst children, as can bravery (bordering on recklessness).

Basically, if a student is sorted to Slytherin, there's a good chance that it does not reflect positively on either them or their family. As demonstrated quite well by the Slytherin's in Harry's year.


** According to Dumbledore Slytherin also valued things like resourcefulness, determination, a certain disregard for rules in his Students, thats not necessarily bad and Hermione, Ron and Harry would easily also fit inside that. Like I am not gonna deny that a blood purist/dark wizard will most likely end up in Slytherin, but you can easily assume lots of normal students end up there as well.

*** Harry was pretty close, but I don't see the others fit Slytherin particularly well. Ron is good at chess, but that hardly makes him a tactician or great leader like fanon tries to. I am pretty good at strategy games, but I am sure as hell not qualified for battlefield command. And most modern strategy games are a lot more realistic than chess. And Hermione is honestly a Hufflepuff with her deep loyalty to Harry or a Ravenclaw for her learning abilities before she is a Slytherin. Most of her more devious actions are done for Harry.

  resourcefulness, determination
#+end_quote

But with most children, those traits usually related to their friends (Hufflepuff or Gryffindor) or academics (Ravenclaw). You will find ambitious, determined children, but those will be one in a thousand, if not rarer.

  a certain disregard for rules
#+end_quote

That describes all children. You might as well say "breathing air".

**** What does Ron not being a great leader have to do with anything, he sure as hell is very ambitious as a 11 year old, like the mirror of erised showed.

And Hermione honestly fits all houses, like you can pretty much find all the traits we find mentioned in the songs in her, except pure blood of course.

As to the disregard for rules, I am pretty sure scales matters here, like in that year alone Hermione stole a dark book from the restricted section brewed polyjuice potion and Harry and Ron impersonated their classmates to find out who the heir of Slytherin is.

For most kids disregard for rules is more about stuff that restricts their ability to have fun or when it takes too much effort to follow the rules.

This is a pretty common argument and role for him in fanon

But does he ever do much to follow up on it? Because the earliest thing I can think of is his Quidditch training.

But that was all done out of loyalty to Harry, by both of them as well as a sense of duty, not out of any personal desire.

His goal was to become Headboy and Quidditch Captain, either of these would likely have happened in seventh year since he got good grades, was a Prefect and very good at Quidditch.

Slytherin appreciates a "certain disregard for the rules".

Just because Hermione is motivated by loyalty to Harry doesnt mean she doesn't disregard the rules.

Disregard for rules doesn't mean breaking them for the hell of it whether it achieves something you want or not. It means deciding that X is more important to you than a particular rule, so ignoring that rule fo achieve X.

I buy the idea that Hermione (who is cunning resourceful and determined) could, in a more neutral world, have been right at home in Slytherin.

Ron less so, I think, as though he has /dreams/ of being great (as seen in the mirror of Erised), he doesn't actually have the determination to achieve any of those dreams.

Having said that, perhaps if he had found his way into Slytherin it would have cultivated in him a greater drive to realise those dreams?

**** I have a pet conspiracy theory that JKR had originally planned to put Harry (the hero) in Gryffindor, Ron (the friend) into Hufflepuff, Hermione (the brain) into Ravenclaw, and Draco (the adversary) into Slytherin. However, she then realised how much of a logistical nightmare it would be for the three to interact, so she stashed them all into Gryffindor.

Harry would make a better Hufflepuff than a Slytherin, I think. One could make a case either way based on the Mirror of Erised, since Slytherins appear to value familial loyalty, but the aspiration to be reunited with one's family with no connotations of wealth or power strikes me as more Hufflepuff than Slytherin.

Ron probably has a better case for Slytherin, since he actually has something to prove, even if he lacks the discipline to do so. A somewhat uncharitable but understandable interpretation of his character is that befriending the BWL satiated his ambition to be distinguished from his brothers at least somewhat. (Did I just make the case that /Harry/ held /Ron/ back from greatness? I think I did. O_O )

For Hermione, I don't think it's loyalty to Harry in particular as much as loyalty to the causes that Harry happens to play a key role in due to prophecy and other circumstances. When the two conflict, she generally chooses the cause over Harry, which makes her a Gryffindor through and through. She'd make a terrible Hufflepuff, because for all her good intentions, she isn't nice, she only barely tolerates others' flaws, and she certainly [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Rogers][doesn't love people just the way they are]]. I used to be a fan of Slytherin!Hermione, but I don't think she's selfish enough for that.

Hufflepuffs would make excellent minions due to their loyalty as long as you are not genocidal.

** To be honest, considering the time in which the Founders lived, and all that happened in history (Witches hunt and trials) I don't think Salazar dislike of Muggles was a bad thing at the time.

I honestly think that his dislike for muggles was for good reason, but that as time went on, that reason was lost, and just the fact that he didn't like them remained.

With that reasoning, the basilik wouldn't be to clean the castle of muggleborns, but to protect it and it's students from attackers, and the basilik would have instructions to listen to Salazar's heirs when it came to protecting the school.

*** THANK YOU. This has always been my head canon. I've never understood how Salazar could have possibly hated muggleborns. This is a thousand years ago. The population is tiny and there's no magic schools at this point. The only way your learning magic is self taught or taught by parents. You're also not going no know any wizards/witch's unless you become powerful enough to become a court mage. Your not gonna marry a wizard/witch 90% of the time your gonna marry local muggle boy/girl.

**** The foundation of Hogwarts and the exile of Slytherin preceded witch hunts by a few centuries though, with several secular and even Papal bans around the time Hogwarts was founded.

As for how Slytherin could have hated them? Well, he was a bigot. I mean, Hitler had a thing about Jews betraying Germany when they proportionately fought the hardest in WWI from all population groups within the German Empire. Bigots don't do normal logic.

*** Most witch hunts happened in early modern times though, 500 years after Hogwarts was founded. There was even a complete ban of them during the early middle ages by a council in the HRE because they were considered a joke (I can't find out whether that was considered binding for all Catholics or just within the empire).

**** Yeah, they happened around (and were the reason for if I'm not mistaken) the edification of the Statute of Secrecy. But what I really meant was that, at the time, there would have been I think a lot more legitimate reasons to dislike and feel superior to Muggles (lack of hygiene, education, rise of Christianity and wars they might have to get involved with because there was no separation back then).

And for witches hunt to be banned, they had to be a thing first, so just because they were banned, doesn't mean it wasn't a threat. After all, bigots and zealous hardly care about laws if they think they are in the right.
