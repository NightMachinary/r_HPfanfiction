:END:
In the fic Voldemort wants to make Harry Potter his equal, so he kidnaps him from either hogwarts or 4 privet drive. He then trains him, gives him access to his library, and makes him use the same rituals he did. Including one that gives him abilities that his familiar has, Harry ends up having the ability to find the location of people like a magical post owl.
