I would love to read more fics where Harry is on the dark side, has a traumatic childhood in an orphanage, joins death eaters and is insane like Bellatrix. Similar to HP and the Homecoming series. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12867536/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Homecoming]]


** ok so there was one that I read on AO3 but bailed out because it was too dark and depressing for me, and I can't remember what it was called. the same author wrote quite a good WBWL series called Sarcasm and Slytherin, I can't think of the name of the actual story or the author but I just went hunting and it looks like the author cut them loose. if someone can remember with those clues you might be able to find it? I don't know, sorry

Actually you might enjoy the series in the meantime. The first one is ao3(12608820)

** Going by the description you gave, the start-middle of Antithesis sounds sort of similar?
