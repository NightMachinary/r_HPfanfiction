Umbridge messes up and is too specific about Harry's quidditch ban, and states that he was banned from flying on a broom ever again. So next quidditch match, Harry shows up on Sirius's old motorbike.


** Thank you for the prompt. It's giving me an idea that's going into the new chapter I'm writing for a story. Just thank you .

  Harry Potter was not above doing whatever it took to get what he wanted. It often meant he'd have to go to extreme lengths to make people suffer for their stupidity, but the results were always worth it. This Harry Potter takes things too literally. ON PURPOSE. A/N: Slytherin-Harry.

** “So... really I think I will have to ban these two from riding on brooms ever again,” she said, looking from Harry to George and back again.

Her smile widened as she devoured the realization sinking into their faces and it remained in place as she discussed the confiscation of their brooms.

--------------

“It's unfair,” Harry moaned through his hands that evening to Hagrid. Hermione had spotted the light in his hut and three of them hurried through the cold to see their now-returned friend. “I'll never ride a broomstick again.”

“Ne'er seen someone with more natural talent than yeh ridin' a broom,” Hagrid agreed.

This hung in the air for a few moments, the only sound came from crackles of the fireplace and Fang's blubbering snores next to it.

Hagrid developed a wistful look in his eye and scratched at his beard. “I always wanted to know what it was like...,” he muttered.

“What was what like?” Ron asked.

Hermione rolled her eyes, “Flying on a broom.”

“Yeah,” Hagrid nodded sadly, “they're not quite strong enough ter carry people like me.”

“Oh.” Ron looked mortified, “I can't imagine never flying.”

Hermione grimaced, “There's other ways to fly, like flying carpets ---”

“--- motorbikes ---”

“--- enchanted objects ---”

“--- motorbikes?” Harry perked up. Hagrid was far away in his memories and hadn't realized he'd spoken out loud. “Hagrid, motorbikes are a Muggle way to travel on a road, on the ground.”

“Yer godfather bewitched one, real beauty she is --- an' fast too,” Hagrid said, the look in his eyes eerily reminiscent of how he talked about Norbert.

Harry felt a strong sense of pride rush into his chest at the mention of Sirius. A smile crossed his face for the first time since he'd left Umbridge's office, “Does he still have it?”

“Nah he left it with me the night --- er,” Hagrid had an uncomfortable look on his face, “well that night.”

“The night my parents died,” Harry acknowledged, his smile replaced by a taut frown.

“Yeh. I have it in a shed ou' back if you wan' ter see it sometime?” Hagrid offered. “I ‘spect it still flies if you're missin' yer broom.”

Harry glanced back up at that, “Yeah, I might.”

Across from him, Ron opened his mouth a few times, a thought sticking to his tongue, “You know, Harry, I don't think the official Quidditch rules say that players have to use a broom.”

Harry looked delighted at this idea. Hermione did not.

--------------

Despite Hermione's repeated insistence that he shouldn't go ahead with it, Harry lined up with the rest of the Gryffindor Quidditch team in the tunnel to the pitch. It had taken a late night, with Luna and Neville running interference, to get the motorbike into position. Now that Harry sat astride the glossy back, the realization of what he was about to do thumped in his chest. He didn't consider this long, when a split-second later sunlight blinded him as the cover to the entry tunnel opened. The crowd roared as his teammates mounted their brooms and took off. Harry took a fortifying breath, tapped his wand on the bike which started its engine, and launched himself forward.

The wind struck his face and rippled through his hair. This is where he was where he was happiest, in the air and away from realities below. The motorbike was nothing like the nimbler Firebolt but the power he could feel between his legs was a worthy replacement. It accelerated with surprising grace as he swept over the crowd and between the spectator turrets of the pitch.

“POTTER'S GOT A MUGGLE BIKE!” Lee Jordan's voice echoed out. “LOOK AT HIM MOVE!”

Harry kept his eyes ahead as the players assembled in the center for the start of the match. Madam Hooch made no indication that she noticed Harry's choice of ride and reached down to release the bludgers ---

“--- hem, hem.” A squat figure emerged from the stands and pointed a wand at her throat. Harry swallowed as she approached when he noticed her face had taken on an alarming puce color. “Mr. Potter, what do you think you are doing?”

“Playing Quidditch, Professor,” Harry replied.

“You are banned,” she sniffed. “Get off that horrid contraption this instant.”

He reached into his pocket to remove the slip of parchment Umbridge had given him which formalized the ban and offered it to her.

“You'll see professor, I was banned from riding broomsticks. This is not a broomstick.” Her face contorted as she digested what she held. Glinting beads of perspiration appeared at her hairline and she labored with each breath. The crowd stood silent, fascinated by the confrontation.

Umbridge looked up at him once with malevolent eyes, before primly folding the parchment into quarters and tucking it into a petite pocket in her cloak.

“Very well, Potter. Let's keep that temper of yours in check this afternoon, shall we? I would hate to see a repeat of your last match,” Umbridge chided. It was clear she very much wanted a reason to take the motorbike.

“Of course, Professor,” Harry replied, his voice echoing her syrup-filled tone.

** Not to be that guy, but the Muggle Act of 1992 created by Arthur Weasley makes this illegal as a motorbike is, undeniably, a Muggle object. This is just the thing Fudge and Umbridge need to put Harry in Azkaban until there is an unfortunate accident involving a Dementor. And even if it wasn't, Umbridge would just simply correct the ban. Probably even going as far as to give him detention for the rest of the year and banning him of all privileges given to him as an upperclassman. Umbridge literally held more power at Hogwarts than King Louis XIV held in France.
