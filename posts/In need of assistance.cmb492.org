Hello! I will be attempting to write my very own fanfiction. It will be Trio-centric with Harry, Hermione and Ron being the main characters naturally. A very very brief overview of my idea.\\
"Who could have known the effects of the diary? Who could have known that it bonded Ginny's life force with Tom Riddle's, and intertwined their fates forever. Not Harry Potter when he stabbed the diary with the Basilisk fang. Now with unimaginable consequences of that decision how will this shape Harry, his friends and the world around them?"

So there it is, and now my dilemma. It is an unfortunate truth but many fanfictions out there are just plain trash with horrible characterizations. Especially trio-centric ones that I managed to find. Many make Ron this senseless, cruel and uncaring asshole and completely overshadow him in "Harry's glory", while Hermione acts as some useless cheerleader and does nothing to mitigate the damage. So my biggest concern is nailing their characterization right. I want to create good, believable and lovable characters with their flaws and good qualities who stand out for what they are.

And the second problem is how you would go about their magical abilities. For my idea while I want them to be powerful wizards and witch I want them to have something that makes them stand out from the other two. What magical abilities, talents or interests have you seen in fanfiction which made them stood out and have you say "I can just imagine him/her doing that." (I personally find a legilimens!Ron to be an interesting concept)

That's that folks. If you can give advice feel free to do so, with your own ideas and tips, and better yet if you have a good fic you can recommend to all of us that would be marvelous!

P.S.\\
I'm sorry if I misplaced this post here or something, it wasn't intentional.

Play to their strengths and don't sugarcoat their weaknesses. Ron's strength is that he's genuinely fun to be around. Harry's fairly passive during his downtime and Hermione only cares about studying unless someone literally ropes her into having a good time. Ron should be making their lives worth living at every point they /aren't/ focused on the mystery of the year. In contrast, he feels overlooked and totally superfluous when Harry is getting into trouble without him. His only real gripe with Hermione is part of their canon romance, and the fact that she was irritating him before they were friends. Ron has also mastered the skill of being angry with someone while still remaining loyal to them. In every fight with his friends and even his family, there's something that he does that demonstrates loyalty. He checks on Harry during Goblet and refuses to wear a Potter Stinks badge, even though Harry's angry enough at him to throw one of the same badges at him. He stands up to Snape on Hermione's behalf when they're not even on speaking terms. He tracks the other two for weeks after he leaves the Horcrux hunt. The twins give him his crippling fear of spiders with a horrible prank, and he's perfectly cordial with them even while the fear obviously still motivates him. When Ron breaks the rules, he does it recklessly and with bravado, probably taking from the Twins' example.

Harry has a tendency to dwell on the bad things he sees waiting on the horizon. His thoughts go to dark places, and he feels that he has to be involved in everything, not trusting others to handle it for him. He tends to 'keep score' in his head of how others have behaved toward him, not letting them off the hook until they've actually apologized or done something to make up for it. It's not just Malfoy - he does the same thing with Ron during their fights, the Ministry of Magic as a whole, Dumbledore posthumously, Snape, Hermione during the Firebolt episode, and arguably every other student who didn't stand by him during the Heir of Slytherin, Triwizard Tournament, and year 5. His strength is determination and lack of hesitation in pursuing goals, as well as the ability to inspire the same in others. He has a block about Summoning Charms? He learns that shit in less than a week. Inability to cast the Patronus because of horrible trauma? It's his best spell within a couple months. He led schoolchildren against Death Eaters and technically won. His weakness is that he doesn't always pick the RIGHT goals to be determined about, and he's very passive about things otherwise, and can even dig his feet in and refuse to budge if he doesn't /want/ to pursue his current goal. Harry has the least respect for authority and the rules of the trio, and only holds to them when they aren't in his way.

Hermione has a motherly attitude. She genuinely wants to help, and the fact that she's so capable makes her forget that she's not actually an authority figure. This torpedoes any social acumen she might have otherwise. It's shown that people close to her can indeed get used to this - in the later books, she's on alright terms with the other girls in Gryffindor, and she pulled Krum and McLaggen somehow, both of whom were genuinely attached to her. On the other hand, when Harry is alone with her, he's often miserable, since she's /constantly/ studying. It's important to note that while you or I would love to study magic, in-universe it isn't interesting for the people doing it. Hermione studies everything that hard, not just magic. She does actually have to study things, too - don't make her just KNOW whatever McGuffin knowledge you have to have the kids find out. Have her comb the library in an obsessive binge. That's what she does in canon whenever there's a mystery - the Half-Blood Prince, the Heir, Nicholas Flamel, she regaled Harry with dangerous Tasks from past Triwizard Tournaments, etc. Her strength is her wide breadth of knowledge and her ability to focus in on an issue. Her weakness is that she doesn't understand how other people feel, and doesn't get that people find her 'instructing them' to be insulting unless they ask first or she's bailing them out of something (hi, Neville). Hermione only really consents to breaking the rules when she has a plan for it that she feels ameliorates any harm that the act of breaking the rules might cause.

Harry, as stated, will put in a Herculean effort in learning something if it accomplishes some other goal. The issue isn't whether or not some piece of magic would be suited for him - only that learning it would solve a problem he's facing. Personally, I think that something like Transfiguring animated statues would be a nice signature spell that could wind up OP pretty easily. Again, it's not what magic he learns, but the manner in which he learns it.

In canon, even during the first year, Hermione has a natural knack for spellwork. She's only read the books, but she can correct Ron's pronunciation of spells - that's either not taught in the books, or literally every other student missed it. She's very good at the underlying structure of magic. Maybe she's not a quick draw or good at making openings to strike like Harry and Ron, but her spells will be more cleanly done than theirs, and have better results because of that. I would imagine that finicky magic like Disillusionment, alarm spells, or something like enchanting winds would be up her alley.

Ron has arguably the best hand-eye coordination of the bunch. People like to say that his strategic acumen doesn't translate into canon, but they forget about Quidditch. Being a Keeper and having to defend three goals in THREE DIMENSIONS from FLYING OPPONENTS while DODGING BLUDGERS is pretty fucking stressful and challenging on every level. You have to contend with feints, passing, fake-outs for Bludgers, and stay on your broom the entire time. Harry sits on his broom for 90% of the match, then sees a golden ball and dives for it. Ron's on edge the entire match. A brief list of Ron's magical feats, taken from [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Ronald_Weasley#Magical_abilities_and_skills][this]] totally reliable source: He stuns a Death Eater while flying on a broom, which Tonks says was unbelievable. Tonks is a trained Auror. When you can land shots that have the Special Forces asking you how you did that, you're pretty slick. He's beaten Bellatrix and Greyback, disarming the former and... possibly killing the latter with the help of Neville. He also just physically beats his enemies sometimes - he recommends Harry punch Draco in the nose during the first year duel, grabs him by the robes during the first year, beats him up during Harry's Quidditch Match, wrestles with Wormtail, and punches Draco's lights out one more time in Deathly Hallows. He also gets an Exceeds Expectations in his Potions OWL, which, I mean... did literally anyone see that coming? Actually, his OWLS were really good by any standard. He's also naturally (though unintentionally and unknowingly) good at Divination. During second year, he's capable of nonverbal magic - the spell that he cast on Draco but backfired was done without speaking. Hermione notes that the spell was actually quite tricky, as well. He's good at imitation and voice mimicry, weirdly enough. He corrects Harry when they're Polyjuiced as Crabbe and Goyle, mimics Wormtail's voice, and recreates Parseltongue to get into the Chamber.

To sum up, Ron might be best with less graceful combat. A physical enhancement spell would do wonders, and if he could tap into that Divination mindset in combat or before, then he might dodge a spell or two or get an idea about what to do to advance their cause. He's the one who suggested using Felix Felicis to get Slughorn's memory and just brute-forcing the Chamber of Secrets to get a basilisk fang. Honestly, Divination as a whole seems overpowered, and Ron's canonically the most accurate outside of Trelawney.

** When it comes to making sure you're writing people in-character, there's no substitute for re-reading the books. You've got to re-read lots and lots of passages. And when you read from the perspective of a fanfic writer, you'll notice lots of things you didn't notice before (like the fact that Hermione "squeaks" all the time, and that most of Ron's jokes are this specific kind of fun sarcasm). These are the subtle details that will help your story feel "right." And re-reading will remind you why you fell in love with the series in the first place.

** One thing many overlook is that canon Hermione is the driven one of the trio. She is proactive, not reactive. She wants to do stuff, wants to help people, wants to change the world for the better. Be it solving a mystery or trying to save a hippogryff, abolish slavery or found an underground study club, it's usually Hermione pushing for it - and others into it. Harry and Ron tend to be far more reactive until they have no choice but to go and kick ass. Hermione also has never seen a rule that she wouldn't break the moment it gets in her way. Of the trio, she's the one with the strongest "the ends justify the means" leanings. Strength-wise, she's the brains.

** So I'm not completely sure from your summary if what you're saying is that Ginny dies in the Chamber with Tom Riddle, but either way, it sounds like you should at least be aware of linkffn(Forging the Sword by Myst Shadow), as it seems to start from a similar decision point.

Also this sounds like it could be a great read, so I'd love it if you'd PM me when you publish the first chapter.

** I agree with [[https://www.reddit.com/user/FitzDizzyspells/][FitzDizzyspells]] . The best way to nail the characterization right is to reread the original books. I would add to actually make a list of sentences they each say to have their real speech. They each have certain manners or level of language and nailing it is quite difficult and not often seen in fanfiction.

Being able to get right the "voice" of the characters as in the original books would be a great way toward perfect characterization, I think.

** About the Legilimens!Ron, while it is an interesting concept, it's rather unlike that Ron would be good at Legilimency. Like [[/u/ForwardDiscussion][u/ForwardDiscussion]] said, Ron is good at physical side of things. (Also he is good at tactics- chess) Legilimency requires subtlety and control of mind. Ron is the least subtle person out of the trio- and the trio isn't subtle at all..
