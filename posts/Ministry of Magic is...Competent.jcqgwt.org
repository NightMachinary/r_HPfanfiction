I know its part of the fun to have them be complete idiots but are there any fics where they aren't? Like i'm thinking maybe the last minister was and that why Sirius gets locked away. But like after Harry's first year and all the shit that happens, someone gets their shit together and starts caring? Maybe they even help get Harry away from his relatives? idk. But if you know any stories let me know.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

  What if adults acted like adults? If they take responsibility, don't get distracted by revenge, build capable governments, and don't try to hold three full time vitally important jobs at the same time: result? Shit gets done. Sirius raises Harry; Dumbledore is awesome; the Blacks are possibly awesomer; the Ministry is functional, and Lupin gets a very interesting job.

** I remember when Harry gets to the Leaky Cauldron in PoA and Fudge is already there, with Harry's books and Hedwig. This means he not only is keeping tabs on Harry completely separate from what Dumbledore is doing, but managed to quickly predict where he was heading, interrupt the Obliviator en route to Privet Drive to take care of Marge in order to get him to send the books, arrive at the Cauldron, and even bring some paperwork to do along the way.

Fudge is usually portrayed as being an incompetent muppet, completely subservient to Lucius Malfoy's bank account like the sweatiest simp, but if he was just that, he would never have become Minister. I think he actually /plotted his way into being known as a huge loser/, while still holding enough influence to make the corrupt parties notice him and decide to elect him over other puppets.

His actions in OotP then can be seen as him trying to both hold onto power and safety while also attempting to ensure Voldemort would be caught. He can't outright support Harry's claim or else he risks the ire of the Families; he can't, say, have Dumbledore declared as incapable and removed from Hogwarts, because he needs to protect the children. So, he begins a psychologically damaging yet practically harmless harassment campaign, letting Dumbledore operate as he pleases and reinstate the Order, while still maintaining power as long as he can.

  The Lone Traveler arrives on the even of Fudge's election. Instead of pelting Dumbledore for advice, the new Minister listens to a new viewpoint. Much is changed.
