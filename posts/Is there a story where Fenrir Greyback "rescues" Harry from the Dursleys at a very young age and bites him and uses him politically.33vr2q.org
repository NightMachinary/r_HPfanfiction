** I know a story that's sort of similar, in the political aspect, and replace Greyback with Voldemort. It's an enjoyable story, very long and still ongoing, but I think it's good. Werewolves play a part in it but maybe not as big as you might hope. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]] is the title. I wish I had something more specific to what you want, but maybe this can tide you over while you look, at the very least.
