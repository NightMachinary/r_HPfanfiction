Basically, any fic where Harry is not human, and I don't mean as an animagus or something, I mean he is completely and utterly non human. Not a werewolf. Not a vampire. ESPECIALLY NOT A VEELA. No human form or anything. The fic must also NOT involve ANY romance between Harry and anyone. NO SLASH, NO PAIRINGS, NO NOTHING. This is mainly because the majority of fics of this nature seem to contain that trope /CoughVeela!DracoCough/ and it's usually just a poor excuse for Drarry. I personally am not into that kind of fic, and so would like a good story where this is not the case.

The creature that Harry is could be anything, although bonus points if it's not bipedal, I.E is some sort of four legged creature, like, idk, a hydra or something. Also if Harry is transformed into this creature, and wasn't born it, the transformation MUST be permanent and he MUST NOT have a human form.

Thanks for any responses :)


** I've got a few stories on my hard drive like this. Goo monster Harry, demon (incubus) harry, animagus-gone-wrong Harry, eldritch abomination Harry, literal god Harry...

I also have a story called "James Potter is the Devil," which is a completely literal statement. It was a pseudo-crossover with Dante's inferno.

None of them are published, though.

Edit: And none of them have harems/(soul)mates. Incubus!Harry had copious amounts of off-screen sex, though.

**** Well, because you and [[/u/Cloudedguardian]] asked for it...

[[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BxQwY1pPMoFXY0RBdTM5TzdIWjA?usp=sharing][/The Monster from Privet Drive/]] - Goo Monster!Harry, starts during the summer of 2nd year. It's also technically not Harry, but a changeling/fae clone built using Tom's accidental horcrux and tied to Harry's destiny while the real Harry lives in the land of the fair folk as a fae. Rated T.

[[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxQwY1pPMoFXLXEwZW00d0ZQUzg][/Incubus Harry/]] - Sex demon!Harry. Pre cannon. Yeah, that means /exactly/ what you think it means. No lemons, but plenty of M-Rated squick. Reader discretion */strongly/* advised.

[[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxQwY1pPMoFXY3ZUVWdURW4xVHc][/An Outer God Named Potter/]] - Alien-God-Thing!Harry. An experiment in just how OP I could make someone. Not my finest work. Rated T.

[[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxQwY1pPMoFXLVplVXMxd2FKLW8][/James Potter is the Devil/]] - Devil!James, Demon!Harry, Alive!Lily and Free!Sirius. Not much in the way of plot; it was just a drabble. Rated K+.

[[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxQwY1pPMoFXQV9HOHZRU3pXRUE][/Harry The Blood Demon/]] - The unholy love child of AccidentalAnimagus!Harry, Metamorph!Harry, and BloodMage!Harry. Slight AU on how magic works. Rated M.

I think I deleted the one where Harry was an actual god. Some of the ideas for that one ended up in /Incubus Harry./

***** I would definitely follow your stories if you posted them on fanfiction of ao4. Do tell if you have plan on posting them. I really like your take on magic in general and how you've included all of the more common depictions of it in games and anime.

I feel like zerg Harry or maybe infected by something like the Blacklight virus from Prototype would fit right in with the your nonhuman!Harry collection.

*** /Before I read them, my thoughts on the ideas/

Goo Monster/Changeling Harry: Promising idea, definitely want to check out.

Incubus Harry: Does it have an actual plot or is it an excuse for sex scenes? Because if it is then I'm probably not going to check it out, not my cup of tea.

Eldritch Abomination Harry: I actually made a thread awhile ago asking for this, definitely checking this out!

MetamorphBloodAnimagusDemon(???) Harry: Yep. Most CERTAINLY checking this out.

Since you stated in a comment that James Potter Is The Devil doesn't have much of a plot, I'm probably not going to read it, I prefer plot.

Thanks for the many recommendations though! You've just given me a massive reading list!

There's Harry Mewter, where Harry turns into a Mew. Ron and Hermione also get poke-animagus forms, but Harry's the only one that stays transformed.

...He still masquerades as human a lot and does a lot of human things, so it might not necessarily be what you're after. Are you okay with fics where Creature!Harry masquerades as human? If not, someone recommended Enter The Dragon a little while back...

...okay, now that I've got that out of my system-- yeah, Harry Mewter is a good one. The big twist is that nobody has a clue what Mew (or Pokemon in general) /is,/ which poses many problems; it also makes the story much more accessible to anyone who doesn't pay attention to Pokemon, which is a big plus.

So-- yeah, seconding that recommendation.

**** Read that one fairly recently actually, and yeah I agree it is a very good example of what I'm looking for, with the exception that he pretends to be human 50% of the time. But other then that, I loved it! Thanks for the recommendation.

  Harry decides he wants to try Animagi, and persuades Hermione to help... this changes them... a lot. Crossover, of sorts, with Pokemon. Mew!Harry. Not as stupid as it sounds.
