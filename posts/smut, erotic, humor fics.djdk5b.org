I recently discovered "It could only happen to Harry" on AO3. It contained a Harry that is cursed with a constant erection. To "tame" it, his female classmates and the adult responsibles engage a plan to perform a Ritual sex, so that he doesnt have to suffer. Funny fic so far, although i havent finished it yet.

But i want to ask, if someone would know similar fics. The good thing about the Fic is that Harrys behavior/character stays in character or rather Canon. I want this for other fics aswell.

â€‹

As a subpoint i have to mention that in Parvatis Chapter she is performing an oiled erotic Massage on Harry and i really liked this Idea, so i additionally would like to know Fics that contain Harry is the client of such a Massage. It doesnt have to be Parvati or Padma who is the Masseuse, but i would be glad if she is.


** "It Could Only Happen To Harry" is a really good one, one of the best smut fics I'd even venture to say. In a similar vein is "Harry Potter and the Curse's Cure;" I also rather liked "Harry Potter and the Power of Seven" and "Harry Potter and the Rule of Three." All of them are on AO3, I believe.

I don't recall any oiled massages in these, though, apologies.

****** Well, if you mean "It Could Only Happen To Harry," I was just responding to [[/u/Atomstern]]'s post. If you mean "The Curse's Cure," then you're quite welcome. ðŸ˜…

  An ongoing series of one shot stories exploring how Slytherin!Harry would have handled key moments from the books. Events will appear out of order, so don't be surprised if it jumps around. Small but important edit made to Chapter Five

** linkffn(Larceny, Lechery and Luna Lovegood) is pure crack, so not quite canon-like, but has somewhat of a plot and is hilarious nonetheless
