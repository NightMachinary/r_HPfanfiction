I don't think she is - nothing in canon points to Harry having a godmother. I'm just saying it could be used as an AU plot point.

So many stories twist themselves into pretzels trying to justify Harry staying with the Dursleys even though he has living siblings that could maintain the bloodwards. Petunia being his godmother could be used as an explanation for why she specifically is needed. It would also help explain why she takes him in even though she really doesn't want to - she swore a magical oath or something.


** Just write good Dursleys, AU fics don't need to keep this formulaic abused childhood trope in children's literature. This will also make Dumbledore look a lot better.

Harry already has so much going against him that there's no need to add abused childhood to drum up more reader sympathy for him.

*** Yes I agree Inquisitor! :) Make good Dursleys and just let him have somewhere nice and loving to go back to in between the life and death crap and Voldemort murder attempts! :) He already has enough going on!!!!

**** Good Dursleys diminishes the isolation and longing Harry has for his parents, also the death of Sirius. Don't feel as gut wretching if he still has a family that loves him.

I am more of the idea of not bad Dursleys but not good Dursleys either. More like indifferent Dursleys. They fullfil his physical needs but not emotional. They take care of him and have empathy but still are wary of him and don't love him.

***** Well...in fanfics you don't HAVE to just mindlessly kill Sirius every single time, no matter how different every other aspect of life or course of events go...That shouldn't even be a problem!!! Also WHY does Harry have to long for his parents and be isolated? And why can't he still long for his DEAD PARENTS with caring relatives? Plenty of people do! Is it not LONGING ENOUGH, or what? This thinking is probably how people come up with all that severe Dursley abuse crap. Harry isn't suffering enough, he's not isolated enough!!! Why does he even have to be?!

****** Absolutely, and if Voldemort kills off the good Dursleys, Harry will get to suffer more from a different angle.

Another thing is that I'm getting tired of this overused abused childhood trope

******* Exactly! Now he can lose his loving family he REMEMBERS as a reason to fight instead of the two dead parents he doesn't even remember when he was a year old!

I hate it by now too. I make my Harry's get adopted a lot in my fics! And have good mentor relations with Dumbledore. :) Just because canon used a trope doesn't mean everyone else has to. I thought people here hated canon railroading stations!

******** Oh if I write this I would totally kills the Dursleys. Never makes sense why Voldemort didn't try something to Harry's surroundings. Can totally kill Hermione's parents too.

The Dursleys. Hermione's parents. Sirius. Dumbledore. And yes, Hedwig again.

****** I didn't say it erases the longing. I said it diminishes it. The clear point of the books was to isolate Harry. It is a common approach in many books. You keep putting your character in a corner.

His parents. His childhood. Cedric. Sirius. Dumbledore. Ron leaving. Every thing was meant to cut every stone Harry had relied on before and see him how he develops on that.

A good chunk of his personality is his losses. You can of course not have experience losses as that, but the logical thing would be to develop him into a different person or use different mechanisms to take him there.

Or you can have him as a completely different person.

******* Well I guess I just don't believe in that literary technique of piling more misery and bullcrap onto your characters. I think it just gets depressing and awful the more it happens. Hedwig was unnecessary in canon, and so were Remus and Tonks, and maybe even Fred. Sirius was the only fine one. But I hate fanfics who twist reality to make it happen the same way with that stupid DoM battle, always in fifth year.

******** The thing is Canon is not misery for misery sake (unlike some fanfics). All deaths have a point. I actually thiy JKR was always afraid of Killing characters. Never as misery enthusiastic as other authors.

Harry's parents have to go in order for the plot to kick.

Cedric has to go to put in motion Voldemort and the Ministry.

Sirius has to go so Harry is left without parent figure and relies more on Dumbledore.

Dumbledore has to go to take Harry and the wizarding world support and up the stakes to 100

Hedwig has to go not only because JKR doesn't need her. But on a thematic approach is the death of childhood who only her or Hagrid's death would have accomplished

Fred has to go because of odds. JKR has to show that the BoH was hard and people have to die. Too many Weasleys and one had to take it. She had already toyed with killing Arthur and she couldn't do it then (because she is no fan of misery for misery sake) so she had to even the scales now

Remus and Tonks' have to go because of two point. Again, raising the stakes in BoH. And from thematic point mirroring Harry's situation with Teddy.
