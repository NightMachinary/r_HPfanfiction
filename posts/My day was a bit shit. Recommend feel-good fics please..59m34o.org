If not...well, a while back, I went to a zoo, and the funny thing about this zoo was, in one of the parts of it, hens and deer (and a very big turkey) were allowed to roam free, and you could get a bag of feed so that you could hand-feed the deer.

The reason I'm bringing this up is, imagine James Potter at such a zoo, who, when nobody's looking, turns into his stag-animagus form, so that he can innocently nuzzle Lily and give her fingers a friendly nibbling.

Just a silly thought, you can imagine it and see if it makes you smile.

  Harry and Luna meet in the Room of Requirement. Mistletoe appears. Will Nargles be a problem? Takes place in during Harry's fifth year, as he and Luna get closer. Basically pure fluff, largely consisting of conversations. NOW COMPLETE.

** "Oh God, Not Again" has a few grammar errors, especially in later chapters, but it's hard not to laugh at it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again]]

"Dinner With The Weasleys" is one of the warmest fics I know. This is the fanfiction equivalent of going to your grandparents for Sunday Dinner after church.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7227719/1/Dinner-With-the-Weasleys]]

This is a collection of short poems. Some are rather sad, but there are others--"Brothers" is a good example--that are charming.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7487781/18/10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1]]

"The Wendell That Wasn't" is hilarious. Snape has to haunt Harry as a ghost after the Battle of Hogwarts. Neither one of them is the least bit happy about it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4396574/1/The_Wendell_That_Wasnt]]

"Promotion" features Ron teaching Hugo how to play chess.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4173777][The Girl in the Kneazle Nighty]] is one of my very favorite feel good fics. Even though this is slash, IIRC it's just a kiss at the end and not at all the main plot of the fic. This is a Harry/Draco fic told entirely from Luna's POV. Luna, Harry and Draco all volunteer at children's home which is so sweet and the kid OCs made me smile repeatedly while I was reading. The best part about this was how Luna was written - I did not have a strong head canon for Luna before this fic, but after reading this I feel like I GET canon Luna so much better. It is a wonderful character study of Luna and I really think you'll like it. Linkao3(4173777)

Also [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7737991][Put Your Guns Away Its Tea Time]] and the sequel are great slice of life post Cursed Child fics that have a wonderful family dynamic and a great Harry/Ginny relationship. Linkao3(7737991)
