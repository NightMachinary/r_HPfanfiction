A companion question to the "What if Harry was raised by a tiger mom" thread, I'd like some recommendations on stories where Harry is raised by genuinely nice people and is well-adjusted before he heads off to Hogwarts.

That said, his being raised by said nice people need to be a focal point in the story and not just brought up and then forgotten.


** The Accidental Animagus and its sequel Animagus at War where Harry is raised by the Grangers:

** I like the series "alternate living arrangements" by Triscribe that as it says is a series of stories (unconnected from each other) where Harry is raised by different people. My favorite is "The Extra Weasley"

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1040795]]

Unfortunately most of them if not all are incomplete, but still very entertaining. Another interesting story, by another author called AnyaYanko, is "The Phoenix burns brightest" where Dumbledore himself takes up on him to raise Harry, and I'm happy to tell you that one is currently being updated the last update being on 23th of January so i have hope to see it finished.

  When Petunia Dursley refused to take Harry in she forfeited his birthright protection, so Dumbledore took the baby to the safest place he knew: Hogwarts.The applicable staff (mostly just... not Snape) took Harry in on a rotating schedule as he grew from baby to toddler to child. They traded extra credit for babysitting among the older students, and Harry grew up knowing a few dozen different laps that were safe and warm to nap in.This was a Harry who grew up among books, among old transient walls and learned professors. They gave Binns night duty sometimes, and let him talk young Harry to sleep. This was a Harry whose world changed, on principle, daily. The stairs moved. The walls became doors. You had to keep your eyes open--you had to pay attention. So he did.He grew up in a school. Knowledge was power, but knowledge was also joy. This was his sanctuary. There was magic in his world from birth.

** The Dangerverse! [[https://whydoyouneedtoknow.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter/]]

It's an AU where Harry is raised by Remus and Sirius and a couple of OCs, one of whom is Hermione's twenty-year-older older sister raising her after their parents were killed by Death Eaters. It's got a few issues--for a series with quite a large number of minor relationships, for example, and which goes on to implement a reorganization of the basic family structure, it doesn't actually seem to remember that people who aren't straight might exist--but I'm still quite fond of it, and it's one of the fics I end up rereading every few years. Aletha and her and Sirius' daughter, Meghan, are still two of my favourite OCs.

--oh, and it's very long. The first book comes in at a little over 200k; I think the series as a whole is a little under two million. This is an advantage for me, but I appreciate that not everyone might feel the same way.
