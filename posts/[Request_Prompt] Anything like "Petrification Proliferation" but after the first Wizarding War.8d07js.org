This means: Competent/Clever adults who follow reasonable policies and do their jobs. The government is in a state of emergency after two of their most famous Aurors are crucio'd into insanity. Veritaserum and Unbreakable Vows are allowed to get to the bottom of this. Maybe there are other imaginative methods to investigate this (this is /MAGIC/, maybe a Seer can look into tea leaves or something).

- Questions are asked: What happened to Harry and Voldemort? Did he really just go /poof/?

- Dumbledore is a key witness. There's going to be an inquiry and Veritaserum.

- The prophecy comes to light (closed Wizengamot session or public knowledge) and the origins of Voldemort are revealed.

- Snape is basically screwed, but maybe gets offered a deal (depends on what he actually did during his time as a Death Eater)

- Sirius is immediately exonerated

- A manhunt for Peter Pettigrew, the illegal rat animagus, ensues

- Bellatrix, the Lestranges and Barty get filled up to the gills with Veritaserum and asked sensible questions: What are the things you want us to know the least? What are Voldemorts biggest secrets that you are aware of? List all the Death Eaters by name. List all the crimes that you committed or were a witness to.. etc.

- Lucius Malfoy gets the same deal. No-one is going to buy the ridiculous "I was imperiused" defense.

- Most other Death Eaters are exposed by this chain of Veritaserum questioning

- Financial assets and properties are seized and paid as reparations to victim's families or Muggleborn charities [I'm quite partial to turning Malfoy Manor into a Muggle orphanage]

- Corruption in the ministry is exposed. The ministry and Wizengamot is cleaned up "Swear an Unbreakable Vow of fealty or seek other employment"

- A cursed cup, which belonged to Helga Hufflepufff, is found in the Lestrange vault, which was given to Bellatrix by Voldemort. => Dumbledore or the Unspeakables quickly figure out what this is. The Horcrux hunt starts 15 years early. There's a big debate whether Harry Potter should be thrown through the veil.

- All convicted Death Eaters are thrown through the veil, because Voldemort might come back and Azkaban won't stop him.

I'm not the brightest lumos ever cast, so there's probably a bunch of other smart ideas that would be used to take advantage of the amazing miracle that is Voldemort's unexpected defeat.


** I have to object to the 'swear Unbreakable Vow of fealty' idea; it's disproportionate retribution if someone makes an honest mistake or has doubts enough about the Ministry's conduct to engage in civil disobedience, or if they end up imperiused, potioned or otherwise enchanted by someone outside the Ministry. I think a better solution would be a magical contract, DA-style rather than fanon-Goblet-style, so that anyone who ends up taking bribes or doubting the Ministry's stance or being controlled is only visibly marked.

I also have to question the 'kill every last convicted Death Eater and seize their assets' stance; if it's a double-check all the facts and test all the evidence, check all the appeals and such procedure, that's plenty of time for lots of Death Eaters (lots of whom come from rich old families) to win over the courts with their excuse. If it's a summary execution thing, there's a massive risk of false positives.

In either case, Veritaserum is fallible; if you'll remember, in canon Voldemort framed Morfin Gaunt and Hokey the elf for murders using False Memory Charms, and truth potion wouldn't reveal those. Even if someone did commit a crime, the Imperius /is/ a completely valid defence, as are love potions, the confundus charm, possession by a dark object...and inversely, someone who's truly guilty can use Occlumency, modify their own memory, use a neutraliser/antidote to Veritaserum...

It's also worth noting that at the time of Voldemort's first 'death', the Death Eaters were winning; Voldemort's disappearance threw them into chaos, but if the Ministry took a hardline retaliation stance, one of the Inner Circle (Malfoy, Rookwood, etc) could easily regroup the Death Eaters into continuing the war. They would still have the advantage, due to being able to hit-and-run on weak targets, use imperiused or otherwise controlled victims as proxies or meat shields, while the Ministry would be stuck with being highly visible and spreading its resources thin to guard everywhere.

And, Regulus knew that Slytherin's Locket was a horcrux, but he thought there was only one; how would the Ministry know that there were five horcruxes (at the time of Voldemort's 'death'), as opposed to say, two (3 is a lucky number, right?) or just the one or if they even belong to Voldemort or who-knows-what?

Obviously the Vow would be quite complex (like a contract), with lots of special clauses and loophole-protections. Things like "under your own will" (under the proviso that you're still culpable when you allowed yourself to be imperiused with the plan of commiting treason) or "mistakes are allowed" ( excepting gross negligence) are no brainers. If this weren't 1981-1982 Hermoine should do it, but since I asked for competent adults I expect someone at least as smart as her can come up with something fairly water tight.

#+end_quote

Well if it were true that these were impenetrable defenses in court then their legal system would be completely busted. You couldn't prosecute any crimes if any criminal has just to yell "I was imperiused" and everyone just sticks their head in the sand and accepts this.

Three things:

1. If spellcrafters and aurors are worth their salt they will come up with counter-spells and investigative methods that can defeat such criminals. JKR gives us very little details on stuff like this, but we know "Priori Icantato" (the spell that is cast on a wand) exists ("Who cast imperio on you and at which times did this occur?") and I'd expect it to be only one of many spells in the toolset of an auror. We know Dumbledore can recognize fake memories.

2. Conventional investigation can actually figure out whether something like this is plausible. Oh look, the suspected Death Eater Lucius Malfoy actually beliefs the same things as Voldemort, has a bunch of Muggle carcasses in his basement and eats babies for breakfast. We have a hard time believing in these "Imperius" claims Mr. Malfoy. Get memories from low-tier Death Eaters to check whether he ever cast the Imperius on his own DEs. Maybe establish that marked Death Eaters are always willing participants, because Voldemort wants *loyal* servants.

3. Again, Veritaserum: "Did you plan to memory charm and obliviate yourself of important evidence prior to your capture?". "What are your views on blood-purity?" "Are you in league with the Voldemort" "Please tell the truth, the whole imperius defense is just bs right?"

This whole thing really doesn't seem as insurmountable as everyone claims and I'm just a mere muggle who has to work with the 2-3 tools that canon has given me. If it is true that the "good guys" have such useless tools to prosecute crimes, then they are incompetent compared to the DEs and it was a condition of this post that they are smart and competent.

In any event the Imperius defense should be handled the same as "Insanity" in muggle court: I think the term is affirmative defense (?). You can't just claim that you had a bout of insanity, the onus is on you to actually proof that this was the case (expert psychological evaluations, etc).

** The thing is, I'm not sure the analogy holds. Half of /Petrification Proliferation/ was Rule of Funny, and it happened the way it did because twelve years of mistakes all came home to roost at once. It wouldn't happen like that immediately after the first war, and this outline, while interesting, sounds like a much darker sort of fic in /Divided and Entwined/ territory. But here are my thoughts on how a Competent Leadership fic set in 1981-2 could go.

On the night of 31 Oct-1 Nov, Dumbledore is scrambling to figure out what happened. He knows the Potters were attacked, and people are saying Voldemort must be dead because people are coming out of the Imperius Curse all at once (like at the end of Book 7), among other signs. However, Dumbledore is suspicious because there is no body, and he knows Voldemort got up to lots of dark magic that would allow him to survive an apparent death, of which horcruxes are only one possibility. He is playing things close to the vest first and foremost because he does not want knowledge of those magics to get out.

Dumbledore knows baby Harry has been marked as the subject of the prophecy and is also in imminent danger. He spends the "missing 24 hours" getting his scar checked out (to inconclusive results) and trying to figure out where to put him. Not knowing whom to trust (after all, a /Fidelius Charm/ just failed to protect him), he decides to send him to the muggle world under a powerful Protection of Blood charm where no hostile magicals can get to him. McGonagall calls him on the Dursleys being terrible people, but he explains his reasoning, and she agrees on the conditions that they tell the Dursleys what happened in person, and that they check up on Harry after one month.

Barty Crouch Sr. immediately suspects Dumbledore of knowing more than he's saying and investigates for himself. In the process he discovers the Dark Mark on the Death Eaters (which was implied not to be widely known until the second war in canon). The Dark Mark combined with the unrepentant Death Eaters' assertion that Voldemort will return makes him suspicious that Voldemort is not dead. He confronts Dumbledore, who is surprised, but is forced to share his then-limited knowledge.

Sirius is arrested by Fudge, but when the actual Aurors show up, they berate Fudge for shoddy work and are suspicious of how clean Pettigrew's death appears. Sirius is still held for several months, but not because his trial was suppressed or delayed, but because it takes that long to get around to it with all the chaos that is happening. Sirius's testimony is not automatically accepted, but the Aurors' investigate combined with his and Remus's testimony provides enough reasonable doubt to let him off.

It takes months to track down all the Death Eaters. During this time, the Longbottoms return to active duty before being attacked (in canon, it is implied that the attack on them happened months later). This is also when Moody lost his eye. The unrepentant Death Eaters are sent to Azkaban, but those who claim the Imperius Curse present a problem. Even having the Dark Mark is not absolute proof that they are lying (in canon, there is no murder-as-initiation or any explicitly stated invalidation of mind-altering magic). In practice, whether they are convicted comes down to selling each other out and whether they can afford a good barrister. After Rookwood is arrested, all Ministry employees are required to sign magical contracts of loyalty, DA-style, which roots out a few more true believers who thought they were in the clear.

Dumbledore visits the Dursleys after one month and discovers they are terrible guardians for Harry. He has not been idle, but has considered his options for the past month, and he assigns Arabella Figg to live in the house with them until it is safe for Harry to be moved. Once the dust settles, Harry is taken from the Dursleys and adopted by Emmeline Vance. Sirius sues for custody, but he is still under enough suspicion that he only gets visitation. High-ranking Ministry officials who know about the prophecy keep a close eye on Harry.

On 1 Sep 1987, Peter Pettigrew is found alive when he trips a ward Dumbledore set up when Percy Weasley brings him into Hogwarts as a pet. Sirius's file is closed, and he is awarded joint custody of Harry. Or maybe he just marries Emmeline. Who knows with him?

I do not understand. Did you forget about Veritaserum? They can't lie. "Were you actually under the imperius during all of your crimes?" "No." "So you're just making shit up to get off" "Yep!" Case closed.

Even if Veritaserum doesn't work, there's still the imperius and legilimency or water boarding (just kidding, but I'd expect the Unspeakables to have some tricks up their sleaves that aren't torture). I already responded to this in another post at length: I find it ridiculous that law enforcement would just shrug and stick its head in the sand when presented with the imperius defense. "Well, he claimed imperius, guess you're free to go now. Everyone knows it's the perfect legal defense. Azkaban will be closed, no more trials!!!"

What some people seem to fail to understand is that with proper investigative procedures and Veritaserum crime investigation would be almost infallible.

In your alternate solution Malfoy would continue the fight that his side was already winning by that point and the conflict would drag out for several more years of death and destruction.

Hell, with the fighting actively continuing chances are they find Voldemorts spirit a lot sooner than in canon and resurrect him before Harry even goes to Hogwarts.

Peace treaty isn't the right term for a civil war (unless it ends in two states). In any case nations usually deal harshly with traitors (the losers of the civil war), because you really can't afford repeat offenders... and in the case of the DEs these aren't just run-of-the-mill traitors, they are really really heinous and a stain on society even without the whole high treason bits.

Unless 1 side manages an overwhelming military victory (which isn't the case here) they do end in a treaty. And the first paragraph of that treaty will be an absolution for the leaders of the opposing side where all actions are written off as part of the war and not punishable by courts.

I mean, you have to. If you don't offer them a way out they will simply never stop fighting and you'll be stuck in a deadly guerrilla war for decades against people that have nothing to lose.

Sure, some individuals who are guilty of extreme cruelties will be offered as a sacrifice to appease the masses. (like the Lestranges) but the vast majority of "foot soldiers" or "generals" will be set free.

Of course, that's why you kill them all or imprison for life. War of the roses? French revolution? Boxer rebellion? Often there isn't even much left to kill, because the other side has already been genocided into oblivion before official end of hostilities.

That a civil war ends in such a precocious balance where you can't afford to deal harshly with the losers, like the U.S. civil war, is IMHO the absolute exception. But I readily admit that I'm no historian and would be happy to be proven wrong.

The U.S. is actually a decent example on why this isn't done. It certainly isn't as united as it could be and there seem to be a lot of confederacy sympathizers and racist sentiments in the south still around.

Sure, let's focus on minute details of medieval culture, because that was totally my main argument here... The main point is that there was no widespread genocide amongst the foot soldiers and that the end of the conflict was handled in relative peace. the war ended when Richard III died and that was considered the end of the fighting. They didn't go on a rampage killing every last citizen in York!

It's a "civil war" in the broad sense that it involves a "war" (more like an uprising really) inside a single country without outside interference. However apart from that it was a completely different beast and not at all comparable to what people think about when they hear civil war.

Negotiations began in September 2012, and mainly took place in Havana, Cuba. Negotiators announced a final agreement to end the conflict and build a lasting peace on August 24, 2016. However, a referendum to ratify the deal on October 2, 2016 was unsuccessful after 50.2% of voters voted against the agreement with 49.8% voting in favor.

  In canon Malfoy "bought" his freedom by offering an end to the war and the ministry took that deal knowing damn well what was up.

Do you have some evidence in the books or an interview from J.K. to corraborate that? I've never heard that theory before.

** Late to the party, but a question:

Given the relaxing of certain policies during the war (namely allowance of Auror usage of Unforgivables against Voldemort's forces), why not allow Imperius in questioning? To cut down on abuse by the court, the curse could be used to only compel the victim to answer a verbal question regarding if they had been previously Imperiused into joining Voldemort's cause (and done by a different court member each time). Once that is determined (the caster knows when the victim throws off the curse), the rest is more procedure to determine just what they did, where normal investigative methods would hold precedence.

Memory Charms aren't really a concern here. According to Hermione in DH, the charm is difficult and known to be dangerous. A Morphin Gaunt situation would be about as rare as needing to fear an Occlumens foiling the Veritaserum given a failed memory alteration would leave the victim pretty fucked up. It's just unreasonable to think Voldemort routinely Obliviated his own forces flawlessly.

*** Yeah, I think I mentioned this as a possibility somewhere else. The categorization about which spells are "Unforgivable" doesn't really make much sense to me anyway: The Imperius only makes you act differently (as far as I understand it), Obliviations and Memory Charms can literally change you into being a different person: Imagine removing a fundamental memory that is a foundation of your character core and replace it with something else. I think the implications of the Obliviation spell are horrific, but wizards and witches throw those around like candy.

This and most of this thread are large components of my belief that Magical Britain is completely retarded.
