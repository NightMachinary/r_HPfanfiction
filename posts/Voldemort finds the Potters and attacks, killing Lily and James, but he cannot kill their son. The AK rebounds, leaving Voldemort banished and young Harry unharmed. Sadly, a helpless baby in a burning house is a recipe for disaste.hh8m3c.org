TL;DR - Voldemort is banished as in canon, but Harry then dies anyway due to the condition of the house. Both Voldemort and Harry are off the board. How does wizarding society react and/or change?

Besides that, it wasn't really the point. 1 November is going to be a cold night, and the point of the prompt was Harry dying. Arguing about the reasons for which he actually wouldn't die in the invented scenario seems to me to be missing the thrust.

******** First day of winter is December 21st aka the winter solstice which is the day with the shortest period of daylight and longest night of the year. It's a thing, it's on many calendars. Of course depending on where you live the normal weather at that time of the year is goinf to be different for you. Also technically the there are 2 winter solstices one for each hemisphere ( northern and southern).

Also just to you know the Spring Equinox is March 20, the Autum equinox is September 23 and the summer solstice is the June 21st. All of these are not arbitrary dates they mark they mark the longest and shortest days of the years and for the (solstices) and the days of the year where there'd are exactly 12 hours of sunlight and night (equinox).

So long story short November is Fall. I don't know where you live and this maybe my American showing but thanksgiving takes place late November and it is seen as a fall holiday not a winter one.

And to your point arguing about Harry's possible death is all semantics that we should suspend our disbelief as readers of fan fiction.

Interestingly regarding HP fanon, those divisions also follow the pagan festivals that are inserted into several Pureblood fics - and possibly also Pureblood belief in canon, too. Thus making it likely in at least some ff AUs that November /is/ in fact winter in the wizarding world.

Actually Ginny's fate is completely open and it's really up to the author to decide whether or not she makes it. In canon Ginny threw away the diary and it was found by Harry and Ron in Myrtle's bathroom after visiting catgirl Hermione in the Hospital Wing. Later Ginny sees Harry with the diary and steals it back. Now this doesn't happen any more so Ginny might not get the diary back like she does in canon, if she doesn't she'll survive CoS.

Without Harry around, I don't think Malfoy bothers trying to take a shot at the Weasleys.

** Operating outside prophecy constraints, I think the mirror trap works and Dumbledore wins in book 1. Otherwise, it's hard to say - it all depends on tiny CoS events. The diary's motivations change entirely without Harry there and I feel like it would try to get back to Voldemort, but it's possible that it ends up in dumbledore's hands when Ginny tosses it the first time.

I think Dumbledore would be watching Neville closely, though, and also keeping an eye on other late July births. Voldemort might believe the prophecy fulfilled, but I feel like he would prioritize getting into the DoM earlier to make sure, and events would continue to change from there.
