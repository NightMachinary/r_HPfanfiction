Spelling and Grammar are one thing. The Human Eye, unless you're really particular, might miss a few mistakes. No Big deal, but I'm certain I've seen Hogwarts misspelled.

Answering every single Review, at the end of a Chapter, that sometimes takes up several thousand words (or sometimes even half of an actual chapter's perceived length) is quite bad.

Whole Chapter Discussions/Petitions/"SOPA Is bad, sign this" sort of petitions that could easily be posted separately or on your Author Page, or after the Epilogue. It means Chapter 20 could actually be Chapter 15.

Simple things, that can take away from a good fic. The second one can really get annoying. Checking the word count when a new chapter updates "Oh, a 6k word chapter" and then it's only 3k and the rest are reviews.


** On the review thing, that's why I both as a writer (Except I have neither posted or updated in a year... Cruisifying me won't help if any of the 200 people are here) and a reader prefer AO3. The ability to reply and in general have a discussion in the review section is fantastic. Plus AO3 also have a Preface, Story, and Ending section. Only the Story section will count towards your word count. If FF.net only added one of those that problem would go away.

** Some of the worst I've seen are:

- Change of point of view after a few chapters. In one story, the author began with the 3rd person ("Harry went to the door") and inexplicably changed to 1st person after 3 chapters ("I rubbed at my scar")
- Use of parenthesis to address the reader directly, either as the narrator (bad) or as the author (worse). Like "(although they did not know it, this would impact the future of the whole organization years later)" and "(Remember, Harry doesn't know X yet)"
- Repetition of the same scene from multiple point of view with very minor benefit. In one story I've read, a scene happened from the point of view of character A, with a few indications of their feelings about it, then it was repeated in the following chapter from the point of view of character B, with just some indication of their feelings and THEN in the same chapter, character B told character C about it, repeating the same events a third time with C asking questions or making comments about it. I don't need to tell you that by the end of these lengthy chapters, I noped out of the story because I had the urge to inflict a great amount of pain to someone.\\

The author stepping in can also work in a very non-serious or "crack" story, though I don't recommend it.

*** I would never actually do that. I update fortnightly on one site and ‘as-finished' on another. The latter can leave rather long breaks between chapters as my editor and I both work a lot, with very strange hours (living on opposite sides of the world isn't real helpful) but we do our best and most people understand. I'll always put an author note at the beginning of a chapter, but in bold, so it can be skipped, and I try to keep it short. I only really put translations at the end of the chapter, or maybe a ‘thank you', unless the beginning note contains something really important that I want to reinforce.

**** I don't mind author's notes in general, I definitely do them myself. I just don't like any that are more than a few sentences. It's usually unnecessary rambling or an author responding to every review in a note instead of directly to the reviewers. On ff.net it also buffs the word count so I have an inaccurate idea of the actual story length.

** You mention grammar but I'm going to give one specific example that always annoys me: misuse of reflexive pronouns.

For those who don't know, reflexive pronouns are words like "myself" or "herself" that are supposed to be used when the object and subject of a sentence are the same. For instance, "I cooked myself a delicious meal" or "Harry bought himself some chocolate frogs".

I see stories where they're massively overused. "Send an owl to myself" and things like that. Just "Send an owl to me" or "Send me an owl", please.

Minor thing but pretty much screams to me that the author is trying to show off English abilities he or she doesn't actually possess.

** Chapter notes that aren't clearly delineated from the body of the chapter, whether through the use of bolding or italics or at least a label.

This is mostly a problem in FFN, since as people have mentioned AO3 has those convenient notes sections. But even there every once in a while an author will feel the need to justify every single decision they made in the chapter and run out of space. And 99% of the time it's completely unnecessary. Like, we just read the chapter, we don't need a recap, and if your headcanon wasn't convincing in the context of the story, trying to explain it to us in the author's note is really not going to help.

I like to skip past all that crap, (like most people, I suspect), and it's usually not that big a deal except if I can't tell where the actual chapter is ending and the notes beginning. It can get really jarring, especially since a lot of the time you get massive changes in tone, and it just throw you out of the story. I only ever actually want to read the end notes on the most recent chapter.

** I can't stand when authors bookend a change in POV with explicit labels, i.e. "<Character name>'s POV" or if it's a flashback, they put the word "Flashback" before and after. I take that as the mark of an innexperienced author. There are more graceful ways to handle that kind of transition without breaking immersion.

A lot more feasible in Crossovers. It's more realistic to think Tony Stark could make Technology work around Magic than 90's real world can.

**** I mean, even the nineties were a time of rapid technological change. I don't think it's unrealistic to imagine that some of that new technology interacted with magic in a way wizards didn't anticipate.

***** The general fanfiction consensus seems to be that Magic lets out a fairly high EM Field (Don't know what the canon explanation is) and I don't think we had EM Shielded Electronics outside of Military bases in the 90s... Do we even have them widely available now? It'd probably take about half an hour for Stark to make his Suit EM Shielded, though.

****** They don't have to be widely available to exist for fic writing purposes. And if magic interacts with technology in such a scientifically consistent manner, that at least implies it would be fairly easily detectable, if somebody knew enough to really try. (Maybe the half-blood threat is real? ;b )

Anyway, that's just one explanation, whether it's a popular one or not. That doesn't mean some other fic author can't come up with a different explanation.

Personally I would be interested in a story where technology eventually evolves to the point where it starts to really cause problems for the magical world.

I totally agree with you about Tony Stark, though, especially since magic is already a thing in the Marvel Universe.

******* It's true. In one version of the Comics Tony is actually Sorcerer Supreme (Probably his strongest version)

I tend to like the Starcraft explanation. Making Technology work despite energy is a lot harder than making it work WITH energy. Ghost Stealthsuits are powered by their own Psionics. That, and EMP would (temporarily) render Magicals harmless ... but I've played a decade of Starcraft and it's my favourite game.

It's evidently possible, even though the Ford Anglia is a Gas Guzzler and not a Tesla with tons of Electric Parts, Arthur Weasley made it work with Magic in canon, so it can't be impossible at least.

** Something basically every fanfic in the history of forever does is put author notes on every chapter. This is so common that I've given up hope on ignoring them. Allthough, I don't really blame the authors here -- more the fanfic sites for lack of proper seperation to allow authors to put such notes somewhere that people who don't care for them can ignore them.

They're best when they're small, but if they have to be big for whatever reason, at least mark them very clearly so that it is obvious even if you don't see the "A/N" at first -- everything bold or whatever. Then you can happily skip it all.
