Looking for longer fics where Dudley dates/marries a witch, preferably 40k+ words. If the fic avoids the typical switch-to-and-then-follow nextGen which some fics do that would be nice.


** Try "Widdershins" by Didodikali linkao3(3504701) Dudley's dating Hermione in this extremely funny tour-de-crack.

  Watch in horror as I steal Rowling's Barbies, cut off their hair, and give them ball point pen tattoos. An alternate universe, OOC, illustrated fanfic in which Harry Potter grows a brain. Written way back in 2006.
