I am looking for fics that feature Neville as the main character, and which focus on his life. I am honestly surprised at the lack of them. Neville is the other prophecy child, is full of moral integrity and strength. Aside from some lack of self-confidence as a child, I honestly find him more bearable and palatable that a lot of canon Harry and fanon Harry for that matter.

Looking for fics 50k+, preferably well-written. Slash and romance is ok, as long as it isn't anyone who you need to question if they are evil(cough cough, Snape/Malfoy/Voldemort cough cough). Does anyone have any suggestions?


** I wouldn't call Neville "the other prophecy child" he's more of "the possible candidate that turned out not to be the one".

*** Only because Voldemort decided on one and not the other. I don't remember if canon provides an official reason for why Voldemort attempted to kill Harry, and not Neville, but I assumed it was because Pettigrew provided intel on the Potters.

**** I think Dumbledore theorized that Harry was deemed Voldemort's equal because he was half-blood like him.

**** Honestly I would recommend it! Very well written, focuses heavily on consent, has a very compelling underlying plot... the BDSM is pretty light too - spanking and bondage etc but not too many heavy things that I can remember (like, theres nothing with bodily fluids or extended/24/7 sessions or like, Neville wanting her to always call him "master"). It's much more... BDSM in ways that can be healthy and help people (who want it). Like, Neville makes some ""rules"" but they're things that are more about Hermione taking care of herself (not bringing work home, saying no to her boss). And even when she breaks them, she enjoys the punishments, so.

Anyways, I know it's not for everyone but it's an awesome story so if the above doesn't scare you off I'd definitely recommend it!

** I'm really enjoying this one, it's a Neville x Pansy romantic pairing, set in 7th year at Hogwarts while the trio is off horucrux hunting. Main POV is Pansy though, but I thought it's unusual enough for a mention: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11956114/1/]]

** Neville's a main character (not completely Neville centric) and it's Hannah/Neville. It's sort of a sweet romance that revolves around Neville/Hannah before commencing their Seventh Year. It's probably not quite what you're looking for-but it does have some nice Neville moments.

  Neville thinks his summer will be much like any other: working in his grandmother's garden and other lonely pursuits. After leaving Hogwarts many months before, Hannah Abbott believes she is trapped and isolated for good. They're both mistaken. PreTDH.

  The Firewhisky became a habit after that, though they would both insist that it was a friend, not a crutch. The kindly intermediary that moderated their visiting across the bar on busy nights, slow nights, work nights, weekends. It loosened their tongues. Post-Hogwarts, Epilogue-Compliant.
