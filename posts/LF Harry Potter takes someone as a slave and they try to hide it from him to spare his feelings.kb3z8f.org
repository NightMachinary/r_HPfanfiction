i can't remember the details, but i think it was hermione, that she wasn't the first one to be enslaved and that it was to save her, her life or from something else i also cannot remember, it has been well over a year.

edit 1: the thing they try to hide is the loyalty aspect, specifically the urge to call him master. she slips us and almost says it tho, and after that the gig is up.


** I vaguely remember something like this from years ago, but can't seem to come up with enough details to bring it to mind. The time I think I read it would have been around the time when Paladeus's challenge responses were hit, so is there a chance it was a challenge response?

*** if i had a couple of more, solid details, i might have been able to find it myself, but it is hazy in my mind in the same way something may be on the tip of your tongue.

**** It seems familiar too. Was it a story where Bella casts the spell to enslave Hermione, but it binds her to the strongest nearby magical core, aka Harry downstairs? Then Ron gets captured and Voldie does it to him, and Hermione has to kill Ron in a fight in the Chamber of Secrets? that was a sad scene.

I can't remember the name, far too long since I read it, sorry.

***** No, I don't think so, though that sounds interesting as well.
