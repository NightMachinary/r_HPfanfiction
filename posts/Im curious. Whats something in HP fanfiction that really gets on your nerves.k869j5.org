Mine is when Harry is friends with Draco or is in Slytherin and Draco calls someone a mudblood and he's like ‚Äùdid you forget my mother was mud blood‚Äù or something along that line. Like okay, what are you going to do Harry? You can't even turn a matchstick into a needle?


** Indy!Harry

OP!Harry

Dark!Anyone

Bashing (I really goddamn hate this one)

Perfect Princess!Hermione (no, you just flattened the most interesting character in the series - fuck off)

*** Yes yes YES! I HATE bashing and Perfect Princess!Hermione.

/Nobody/ is perfect, and sure you don't like this character but that doesn't mean you can bash them! Especially if you've only watched the movies and decide that Ron is officially the worst character in Harry Potter.

**** I hate the PerfectPrincess!Hermione thing so much because they always end up taking away her edge and agency, and it really goddamn sucks. Hermione is arguably one of the most complex characters in the series. She is good and kind but also scary and definitely not nice. She believes in justice, and will crush anyone with no mercy if they go against that. She keeps reminding Harry that he isn't alone, but dear god, she's fucking terrible in asking for help or receiving it.

Just, Hermione isn't some perfect princess who sits there, does everything right, and has to be rescued. Arguably, she does most of the rescuing in the series with the exception of Harry himself. Hermione's canon self is brilliant and I always get so pissed when authors make her personality smaller than it is to be someone's perfect arm candy.

** ‚ñ™Bashing in any form.

‚ñ™Hermione always ends up as Harry's friend but Ron is the jealous git you don't want to be friends with. Or post Hogwarts fics in which Ron isn't as important to Harry and Hermione as they are to each other. That especially gets on my nerves. Please no.

‚ñ™11 year olds that act like adults. Especially 11 year old Harry to Hermione "Miss Granger". Honestly, stop that shit please.

‚ñ™ Slytherin has special privileges

‚ñ™ Missunderstood Slytherins. They are not. In canon Draco and his group act like gits.

‚ñ™Snape and his dear Snakes.

‚ñ™Dumb Gryffindors, Adorable but stupid pet-like Hufflepuffs, and ok Ravenclaws (ties into Slytherin fics)

** If I hear one more mention of Dumbledore offering a lemon drop or that he has a twinkle in his eye I-

also, I think /most/ bashing is just an excuse for lazy writing and typically not realistically done. If you want you're readers to dislike some, work for it instead of falling on the easy way out

And the idea that he poisons his lemon drops with Veritaserum. Honestly, it's incredible expensive and he's not gonna waste it on 11 year olds.

** - Making Harry cry so easily or giggle a lot. Please learn to write male characters

- bashing Percy. He's my favorite

- Or forgetting that Percy likes quidditch. So many fics write him as disliking it

- No matter what, even ir Harry is the son/adopted son of a dark family or something, he's almost always friends with Hermione

** -Bashing of characters in general

-Misunderstood Slytherins. They can change of course but you can't just erase the fact that they were bullies and racists with ‚Äòmisunderstood' and ‚Äòdidn't know any better'

Gringotts as this super helpful bank where you can remove compulsions and love potions and with a drop of blood you can find all your titles and lands and lordships

Stereotypes for characters based on their houses. (Ex Loud, bullies, dumb and introverts)

Snape as this nice misunderstood guy. I do enjoy a good Snape fic but I can't stand those fics which make him as some poor bullied kid who only joined Voldemort because he was being bullied by James and Sirius

WBWL fics where Lily and James abandon Harry. Lily died for Harry, as if she'd give him to an orphanage or Petunia.

Perfect!Genius!Prodigy Hermione and Dumb!Stupid!Ron

Good Lucius Malfoy. He tried to kill Muggleborns and gave a Horcrux to a 11 year old girl

When 11 year old outsmart 40+ year old politicians.

False Prophecy fics or it was made up by Dumbledore as scheme

** Character Bashing, Overpowered Harry, Draco being perceived as good UNLESS there is an alternate timeline that works (there is a fanfic called Ignoring Destiny that does this so well), Non-Canon pairings (at least not with the main characters), and that is just a few

** -Sirius referring to Harry as cub, pup, or prongslet.

-when heads of houses refer to their house as their ‚Äòsnakes', ‚Äòlions', or ‚Äòbadgers'.

-Harry going to Gringotts, finds out he's the head of a lot of families, and then suddenly becoming the smartest and most powerful wizard known to man.

-Haphne

-Dumbledore and Weasley bashing

** Overpowered characters. You can make characters powerful just don't overdo it or make it out of nowhere.

Perfect Hermione

Muggle AUs. They're not bad themselves I just don't get the point in them since magic is literally the biggest part of the wizarding world. Though they're not awful they just annoy me a bit.

Slytherin muggle borns. I'm pretty sure muggleborns can't be in slytherin so there better be a good reason to have one in slytherin or it'll seem kinda Mary Sueish.

Almost like canon. Fanfics are supposed to be different from canon so it's annoying to see ones that are really close to canon with only a couple lines changed or whatever.

***** I think the hat does have a way of detecting blood status since it seems to be able to find enough information about the students (maybe from their memories or something idk how it works) to let it sort them but I dunno if that was ever said in canon it's just what I've always assumed.
