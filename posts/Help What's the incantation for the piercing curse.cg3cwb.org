I've seen that fanon curse a few times in various fanfictions (including [[/u/Starfox5][u/Starfox5]]'s) and presumably it causes a hole similar to a gunshot wound, but what could it's incantation be? I'm trying to use it in my fanfiction in a scene where it's demonstrated next to a few other curses like Reducto and Bombarda, but those have the defense professor saying the words and I want to be consistent.


** I generally use percutio
