** the thing about this prompt is I assume using legilimency on people unknowingly is illegal

so while Dumbledore has this information there is not much he can do with it considering he is on the outs with the ministry at this time.

We know he had trouble finding a defense against the dark arts teacher and the ministry stepped in and suggested one. -ordered-

I guess he could push his contacts harder or refuse the suggestion of delores umbridge Joining his staff.

*** But once you know it's her, it's easy to gather real evidence legitimately. If you know where to look and what to look for then getting proof is trivial. Especially with Aurors like Shacklebolt having a free pass to investigate.

** "Harry, be careful. Umbridge is the one who sent the dementors after you. I might be forced to take her as the DADA teacher."
