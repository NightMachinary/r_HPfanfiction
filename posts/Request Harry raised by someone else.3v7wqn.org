I'm looking for fics in which Harry is raised by someone else, and also turns out a bit darker than in canon.

I know of Out of the Dark and Into the Green linkffn(10901705) and one where Harry lives with a German necromancer (if someone has a link, that would be great. More details: [[/spoiler][Harry uses the murder of a unicorn to make a horcrux, and the Mafloys come by with one of Voldemort's horcruxes and task the necromancer to bring Voldemort back I think.]]

** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3rufy1/lf_fics_where_harry_is_raised_by_someone_else/][Here's]] a thread that some god among men submitted a while ago. It has a bunch of stories where Harry is raised by someone else. The one's in there that look like they might be what you're looking for are:

- The Snow Queen (raised in the Hugner Gamesverse

- Hail Odysseus (raised/kidnapped by Grindelwald)

- Princess of the Blacks (this one's got some /major/ issues)

- The Harveste series (Harry gets raised by the Addams family and murderizes most of the people who tick him off)

You'll have to Ctrl+F the titles though. I'm too lazy to link them.

*** I'll check them out, thanks! I tried Princess of the Blacks once I think - if it's the one that starts with a femHarry working in a brothel... Wasn't for me.

  The blood wards hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.

** "The Butterfly Effect" comes to mind. Long story short, Harry winds up being raised by Kingsley Shacklebolt and Mad-Eye Moody in Wizarding Uganda. Harry's a bit darker than he is in canon, because Moody is genre savvy enough to realize that Voldemort is likely due to return and is determined to make sure Harry can destroy him once and for all. Harry's more powerful too, but it actually has some decent justification. The entire culture in Uganda starts training at a much earlier age and focuses on harnessing accidental magic. So there's actually quite a bit of effort that takes away from the usual Harry Sue stuff.

*** Thanks, never read about a Harry raised in Uganda. At the very least it should be different from the usual fanfics.

** I've really enjoyed Darth Marrs' linkffn(The Katarn Side by Darth Marrs). So far, it doesn't have hints of being a harem and it's not dark right now, though that may change since Darth Marrs is typically known for having dark stories.

There's linkffn(Study of Magic by Books of Change). It gets darker at the end, and has a sequel but the author hasn't updated in a while.

  When Loki fell from the Bifrost he was expecting the cool embrace of oblivion, not to become a spirit and then be ripped apart and forced into the mind of a six year-old named Harry Potter. With no physical form, he must keep the boy alive if he seeks to keep existing, and everyone knows that the best way to ensure continued survival is to simply become greater than everyone else.
