Just what the title says, looking for stories where Gryffindor house give Harry the boot for whatever reason and he does it alone at school.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

** The currently active Cadmean Victory has a variation of this. It's not quite as absurd as some fics where there's a formal censure process, but it's still bad enough that it will likely suit your preference.

***** TLIL did have a censure process but I don't really mind how it happens, I just like the story after it does.

Also, already reading Cadmean Victory but that's more because I'm a fan of Harry/Fleur.

#+begin_quote
  The escape of Peter Pettigrew and Harry's inherent nobility leave a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature Harry bearing more effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance...

** I think it's often used as a way to get Harry closer to Slytherin, and either Draco or Snape.. Like in /Faith/ (HP/DM) where Weasleys and the "light" are convinced that Harry is dark and the entire Gryffindor turns against him.

I'd definitely be interested in fics like that but with slightly less obnoxiously romanticized Slytherin

  During his fourth year, Gryffindor house is not as accepting of Harry's participation in the TriWizard Tournament, and use an old tradition called exclusion to force him into complaisance. Harry finds out who his true friends are and uses cunning to get his own brand of revenge.
