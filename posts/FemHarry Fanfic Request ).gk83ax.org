  Harriet Potter has always been odd. Between having a shadow that moves on its own and chatting with snakes in the garden, learning she's a witch really isn't the strangest thing that's happened to the bespectacled girl with a lightning scar on her neck. [Fem!Harry, Slytherin!Harry, AU Retelling]

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

Now I have to go disinfect my eyes for recommending Fem!Harry/Snape. But you asked, and this is widely considered the best of that genre.

  AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, starting in Chamber of Secrets and continuing through Goblet of Fire. Future Snape/Harriet. (OotP - DH will continue in a separate story.)

  There was a more sinister reason for Hero's short temper in fifth year than adolescence and excess stress. When she has a seizure while gardening outside no. 4 Privet Drive, in full view of the neighbors, the Dursleys have no choice but to take her to a doctor. The devastating news will affect all that is to come.

  Hollis Potter walked into what she thinks is the final battle of the war that's been raging for the last six years, only to find, when it's over and she's officially lost everything, that she's not where she's supposed to be. Or, rather, she's not when she's supposed to be. She wouldn't have made it as far as she did without being stubborn, however, so she pushed past the surprise and the grief and decides to change it, no matter the cost. --Cross-posted on FanFic: Hollis Potter, with grim determination, walks into a battle that will make or break England - and affect the World War raging around them. The outcome is surprising, even for her, and she is left with nothing to do but adapt. [Slightly Edited/Reworked]

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** linkao3(4876630) ... I like the story even though it is hidden beneath a lot of smut (including kinky one), which needs to be skipped over. fem!Harry pairing is not with Severus Snape himself.

**** Well, I do, but that is not the point. What I mean is that this is one of those stories which are clearly neither apple nor banana. For porn readers, sex is too tame and there is too much story to make things steamy enough, for readers who care about the story, there is IMHO too much smut which needs to be skipped. Cameras gently moving away would work for the story much better IMHO (aside from some scenes which are actually necessary for the story).

The same goes for otherwise excellent story linkffn(12181042), but that has nothing to do with the topic of this thread.

  Harry gets a surprise on his seventeenth birthday when he discovers a secret Lily Potter took to her grave; a secret that will change his life forever.He must learn to interact with the wizarding world all over again, and discovers the darker sides of inequality and misogyny. Not HBP compliant.
