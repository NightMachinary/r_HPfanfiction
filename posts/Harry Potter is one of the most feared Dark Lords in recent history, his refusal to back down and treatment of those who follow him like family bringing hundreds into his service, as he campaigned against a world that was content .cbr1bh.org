** This is NOT the Harry Potter from the series, but a complete OC.

If you want a great dark lord Harry like you just depicted, but who is also the Harry Potter from the series, the continuation of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), is exactly that.

*** Good point, basically blanked on that, so, sorry about that. I've read The Sum of Their Parts, loved it. Thanks for addressing the OC thing though, I really wasn't thinking. Still not thinking, as my tired brain tells me.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
