So I am a bit unsure of how I am addressing characters in my fics, mostly confused if I should write the names as the POV character thinks of them or not. The most glaring example is a chap I'm writing right now from Rose's POV. This is third person.

I have for instance:

1. I write about Hugo as either "Rose's (her) brother" or Hugo.
2. However, I write about Molly or Arthur as "Rose's (her) grandmother" and "Rose's (her) grandfather" every time and never by their names. It made sense to me not to use Molly or Arthur to refer to them outside of dialogues. Still, I'm unsure if this is weird, especially since I struggle once in a while with sentences having more than one "Rose's grandmother" so close to one another, to avoid making a piece of text sound off.
3. I call Bill, Fleur and the twins "Uncle Bill / her uncle", "Aunt Fleur / her aunt", etc... every time as well, and never solely by their names.

What opinions do you have about this? Should one call characters always by how the POV character would think of them outside of dialogue and internal thoughts?

Edit: Also, are "Mum" and "Dad" as well as the "uncle" part in "Uncle Bill" always capitalized even when not at the start of a new sentence?


** For me, it depends on how the character is feeling about that relation at that particular time. When I write from Sirius's POV he nearly always refers to his parents by their first names, but when he's feeling particularly melancholic he'll refer to them as 'Mother' and 'Father'. Regulus is the other way around, they'll always be 'his mother' or 'his father' unless he's feeling distant from them or aggrieved by them.

As for capitalisation, the rule I use is to capitalise it if it's replacing a name. Eg,\\
'I told Mother to leave me alone' vs 'I told my mother to leave me alone'

*** Thanks for the input. I think I do have an issue here and it's more clear now that I write about it. I usually use "Uncle Bill" and only rarely "Rose's uncle" for instance, since that's how Rose would think of him, and feels almost like touching on first person. On the other hand, I always do "Rose's grandmother" and never "Grandma", unless it's inside a dialogue. I guess I need to be consistent, use "Grandma" outside of dialogue once in a while or never use "Uncle Bill" outside of dialogue. I think I'm just unsure of what's the best way to go from a third person POV, not sure if the "Grandma" thing feels too first-person and should leave it for thoughts and dialogues only.

** I write second generation too, from Scorpius's and Draco's perspectives, also third person limited. This is a really interesting question! Here's how I've been referring to the other characters:

There's no sibling to refer to but as someone with siblings, I think Rose's internal monologue would think of her brother as "Hugo" rather than just her brother.

Scorpius thinks of his parents as exclusively his dad or his mum, so Draco is only referred to as "Scorpius's dad." His grandparents vary based on why they're being referenced, so if he's thinking of Lucius as a person who played a role in history, he'd say "Lucius Malfoy," but if he's thinking of him in terms of the development of the Malfoy family, he'd say "his grandfather."

He refers to his aunts and uncles as either "aunt Daphne" or just "Daphne." This depends on the intimacy of the family; I think of my aunts and uncles as either "uncle X" or just "X." I also, like you, don't really like seeing the "aunt" or "uncle" in lowercase. It doesn't look right to me, although it is right. Mum, dad, aunt, and uncle would not be capitalized.

A lot of the adults that are peers of Draco are referred to by just their first name in the narration and their titles in his dialogue. Occasionally, he may think of Hermione as "Rose's mum" or "the Minister of Magic," and if Hermione and Ron show up together, he'd likely think of them as "Rose's parents." The only big exception is Harry who could be "Professor Potter," "Albus's dad," or "Harry Potter," because he has that fame that would make most children think of him in a first name-last name context. In general, Scorpius uses a lot of first name-last name because he was exposed to most of these people first through books.

In response to overusing names to refer to a character, I would not be concerned with that. It may look clunky to you as a writer, but unnecessary synonyms are usually disconcerting for the reader.

A way to remember it: if your character has two sets of grandparents, ask if they're in the same room as the four of them. If they are, use their names after grandma and grandpa. If not, you can get away with not writing their names.

If you're worried that people won't know who you're talking about, include their names in the beginning to show them.

It's all about knowing who's in the same room/house/building. One pair of grandparents and you say their names at some point in the chapter is fine. If it's both pairs of grandparents, use their names. Obviously, Uncles and Aunts will always be named, although not capitalizing Aunt and Uncle isn't the worst thing.
