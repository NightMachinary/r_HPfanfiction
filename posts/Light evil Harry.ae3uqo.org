So I know this sounds weird but is there fics where Harry is on the light side but does evil things to help his side. Like a greater good Harry but on steroids Basically every Dumbledore bashing fic ever

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12140398/1/The-Purge][The Purge]] Harry is on the side of the â€˜light' inasmuch as he is against the Death Eaters and criminals in general. It's a dark fic so if graphic depiction of torture is not your cup of tea don't read it.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. Now, if only everyone else would realise this...

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.
