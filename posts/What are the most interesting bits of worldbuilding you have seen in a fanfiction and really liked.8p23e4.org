** Plenty, but my favorite are:

- Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin linkffn(11191235) is /filled/ with things like this that I love, but one of my favorites is The Anathema Codex. Its a forbidden book secreted away by the original members of the Wizengamot, and contains twelve spells/magics/rituals that are so dangerous to the world that any one of them gives you a one way ticket through the Veil in the Ministry.
- The concept of the Battle Mages in Magicks of the Arcane linkffn(8303194). Also from that fic, the Black Arts, which involves transcending dimensions to summon demons and monsters.
- The Jiggan and Wadjet eyes from The Phoenix and the Serpent linkffn(637123). Moody stole the magical eye from his mortal enemy (Gallowbraid) in order to negate the power of the Jiggan eye, which is incredibly powerful.
- The idea of the four secret hidden rooms of the Founders in What You Leave Behind linkffn(10758358). Every founder had their own "secret chamber" like Slytherin, but for different purposes, that Harry wants/needs to find.
- The Ygddrassil tree in Realignment linkffn(12331839). This fic is filled with amazing magic depictions, but the Ygddrassil tree is kind of like an instant floo anywhere across the world, but its more like a tree of light that connects to places all across the world.
- The One He Feared linkffn(9778984) is one of my favorite fics from a magic/world-building perspective. In particular, their is a vault in the Ministry filled with objects, including an oak wand named (Excalibur?), the floo source, a statue that anchors the power to make or break contracts, and Arthur's Throne which seems to serve as a foci of sorts for the protective enchantments on the Ministry building.

I have tons of others, but these are the ones that came to mind immediately.

** Going specific first; I love in Northumbrian's post-DH verse that Harry keeps and learns to ride Sirius's motorbike as a way to stay connected to him and the muggle world too, and that Ginny ends up learning to ride it too as a natural extension of her job as a Quidditch player.

Less specifically, I can't remember the fic I first saw it in - I think it may have spread to a few now - but I /love/ the fanon concept that the reason so many of the Pureblood families in Harry's year have only one child is because inbreeding leads to a high percentage of Squibs, and Pureblood families do not tolerate Squib children, so kill or otherwise get rid of them as soon as they are identified. It's dark and horrible, but really reads as something characters of that type /would/ do, behind closed doors, and which would never be talked about but everyone would know the truth of. So, the 'only children' in Harry's year are actually not improbably the sole heirs of their families, but the only /surviving/ children who've made it to that age still within the family.

***** But we don't know that they are sole heirs. I'd be pretty surprised if Blaise, especially, was an only child. Don't we only know about Astoria because Draco married her? That's more the problem of Harry not socialising much. JK apparently intended Hermione to have a younger sibling, but left it too late to insert her. It's pretty conceivable that details like, say, Crabbe actually being the son of a younger son, and thus not the sole, or any kind of heir.

Lets put it this way. Few were more inbred than the Blacks, yet they, outside Weasleys, had the largest confirmed family. Bearing in mind it's canon that they don't live as long, too.

** There are two that come to mind, and they've both been updated very recently!

The first is Six Pomegranate Seeds. Not only is it a slightly different take on the whole Hermione goes back in time trope, with her becoming a new person and living her life in parallel to the original books (what I mean is she's not at all involved with the trio, has more important stuff to do), but it is /so/ deep. Part of it is a fantastic explanation of the lives of purebloods. It's not judgemental, but it goes into immense detail with traditions, rituals, and in a way glosses over them like it's normal at the same time. It's hard to describe, but it makes this society make so much more sense. And doesn't make too many excuses for Death Eaters, at least the older generation, which I always appreciate.

The depth of magic, the plots that are weaved, and simply the number of things Hermione-as-a-reincarenated-Rosier does is mind boggling. Just each time the author describes things, and the last year at Hogwarts... the way people are starting to realise what she's been doing this whole time... It's coming to the battle of hogwarts now and I genuinely have no idea how it's going to play out, especially afterwards. It's genius of the highest order, the worldbuilding is fantastic. linkffn(12132374)

The next one is Reign of the Serpent, a completely AU fic where everything has a different meaning. The author was very good at taking elements of the books, such as the houses, and completely reinventing them as a caste system for example. Sure, the kids aren't very childlike, but that can be overlooked by the sheer amount of shit they go through (especially muggleborns), and the fact that it's all very clever and well done. Slytherin is the emporor, Riddle is headmaster, the order of the phoenix is a rebel group, Grindelwald is THE enemy, so you have to be ready to take some serious changes but it is worth it. Fundamentally, the way magic works hasn't really been changed of fanon. Give it a chance! linkffn(9783012)

  At the end, something happened. Hermione clutches at one fraying thread, uncertain whether she is Arachne or Persephone. What she does know is that she will keep fighting to protect her friends even if she must walk a dark path. *time travel*

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

*** I really don't see the appeal of this fic, I got pretty far in and it was just straight wish fulfillment. Nothing bad every really happens to the main characters, they are all knowing and everything is perfect and it got boring long before the end with it's repetitive story arcs.

**** I remeber dropping it after reading 90% of the fic, because only then did I realize with certainty that absolutely nothing of significance or actual impact was going to happen. Now I just remeber it as that huge waste of time with some slightly uncomfortable rape-apolotics that are just glaring enough to make you doubt the author isn't just inserting his own opinion on the subject.

**** Oh I don't know, there's at least one bit in Harry Crow when most of the main characters come out looking like assholes.

Lavender and Parvati sneak out to meet some boys from the fair Harry's hosting. Those young men planned to drug them with alcohol and assault them. The would-be perpetrators are asked to leave and that appears to be the sum total of their punishment. The two fourteen year old girls whose only crime is being a bit overly romantic and falling for the lies of older predators are shouted at, threatened, blamed and humiliated.

Of course, nobody actually questions their actions in story.

  Having been treated as a servant his entire life, Harry is more sympathetic when Dobby arrives, avoiding Vernon's wrath and gaining a bit of freedom. That freedom changes his summer, his life, and the world forever. A very long character-driven story that likes to play with canon. (Now at Hogwarts)
