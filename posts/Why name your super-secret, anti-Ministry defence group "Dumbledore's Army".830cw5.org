So, you decide to organise a secret defence group, as a sort of underground rebellion against the Ministry. Nothing wrong with that; people need to learn how to defend themselves.

But why in the name of Merlin would you name it "Dumbledore's Army"?!

Did no-one consider the possibility of being caught as a member of "Dumbledore's Army"? If you get caught, they will derive a lot of nasty (for you) implications.

Yes, Harry; we know that you support Dumbledore, yet did you even think about the consequences of choosing such an obviously anti-Ministry-establishment name? What about the other members - did nobody point out that they should choose a different, maybe even confusing name? Also, what if you are caught waving your wands, did nobody have any emergency activists they could have ready in preparation?

E.g. "Oh, hello, Professor Umbridge! Welcome to our knitting group, Delores' Angels."

Seriously, though?


** They started by calling it Defense Association, shorthanded as DA. Then somebody went "You know what else can be shorthanded as DA, Dumbledore's Army" And somebody else replied "What a brilliant idea, that's exactly what the ministry fears so why not?"

*** I think Cho suggested DA and then Ginny wanted to one-up her and suggested Dumbledore's Army. Also, compared to some other stupid shit Harry, did, the name thing doesn't even make it to the top 10.

** They were meant to call it the DA in public. The "Dumbledore's Army" part was an in-joke more than anything else.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5911225/1/Dolores-Angels][Have you seen this fic, by any chance?]] It's exactly what you described.

...Well, not literally a knitting group, but Harry does pretend it's a fan club.

** It's hard to understand what exactly you're protesting here. Are you unsure on the reasoning behind the name, or do you not like the name in general?

If it's the former, the rationale is explained in /Order of the Phoenix/. If it's the latter, the name Dumbledore's Army helped more than hurt. They were fucked when they got caught, and it didn't matter whether they were named Dumbledore's Army or Dolores Umbridge fan club. In fact, it was because they were specifically named /Dumbledore's/ Army, rather than Potter's Army, is what made sure Harry didn't get expelled.

But if they just called it the Defence Association as was originally the plan, Dumbledore wouldn't have gotten the blame and wouldn't have had to go into hiding, and Umbridge wouldn't have had the chance to become Headmistress. No?

**** Well sure, but then Harry gets expelled. Dumbledore was of the opinion that was a worse outcome, so he got himself removed instead. Which is what the parent post was pointing out - the joke actually helped Dumbledore manipulate Fudge.

** They didn't expect to get caught. And on top of that the idea of the government fearing an army of self taught 15 year old is ludicrous, I can see how they would pretend to be that 'army' as an in-joke.
