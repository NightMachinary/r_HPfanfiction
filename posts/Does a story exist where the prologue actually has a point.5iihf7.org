So in published literature, the prologue sets the tone of the story, is usually substantially different than the rest of the book in characters featured, plot content, or even style, and is sometimes a way to provide a tantalizing glimpse of the action before taking a step back to introduce the story.

It's the literary equivalent of a cold open and when done well it can hook you into the story for pages to come.

In fanfiction, the prologue is chapter one. Without a single exception that I can remember. It exists to throw the ffn chapter numbering off, allow the author to misspell the word 'prologue', and, in time travel fics, to show a picture of the doomed world that Harry comes from despite that world not mattering at all.

It is long, rambling, boring, and has never mattered.

Wait, I lied, it was used to decent effect in Browncoat, Green Eyes linkffn(2857962) to skip the "Harry learning about the verse" sequence and jump forward to the plot. Any other examples?


** I laughed and then cried. Too accurate; there's far too many fics I've read that mess up their ffn chapter numbers for no reason.

** In linkffn(The Problem with Purity), the prologue served to introduce the main plot point of the fic.

I find prologues useful on rereads for books and fanfic because many times there's a nice detail that enhances a story.

Once in "The Dark Lord Never Died", detailing the events following Halloween 1981 which set up the Wizarding Britain of 1999 where Chapter 1 starts, and once in "Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water", where it's more of a teaser of the main villain's "birth".

** I generally don't bother reading prologues. I give them a chance, read the first few paragraphs to work out which of the stock 'prologues' it is, then skim the rest in a minute before heading on to the actual story.

Only one of the stories I have written has a prologue, and it is does actually have a somewhat distinct narrative from the rest of the story. That particular story is written entirely in third-person limited where Harry is the PoV character. The prologue is instead limited to a couple of characters native to the crossover world, and instead of filling the reader's brain with a bunch of superfluous information it really just serves to get the reader into the right mind-set for the rest of the story with a bare minimum of time given to exposition. At least, that's the intent. I didn't want to waste a chapter on the whole 'here's my contrived crossover explanation', so I just didn't bother. Instead the prologue is about placing Harry within the new world.

Of course I kinda ruined that by the spending some of the next chapter dumping exposition. But that was chapter 1's fault, not the prologue!
