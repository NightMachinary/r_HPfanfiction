*/THREAD CLOSED - Fic was identified by Ameyaathawale - "Harry Potter and the Last Chance" */

I'm trying to relocate a story I began reading earlier this year before the world got weird.

*OP Harry

*Harry strikes a deal with Rita for exclusives in exchange for her leaving certain people alone.

*Harry kills the Dragon in the first task and stumbles, leading to a picture where it looks like he's mourning over having to kill it.

- the twins dub him "The Knight of the Light" at one point in an attempt to prank/annoy him.

Thanks!
