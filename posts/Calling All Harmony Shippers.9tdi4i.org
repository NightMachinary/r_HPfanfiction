** The first thing I see when I click your link is a Harry Potter/Hermione Granger/Severus Snape ship. Take my downvote and go. /shudder/

*** That's the link to the stories for the competition. (Plus ones are allowed.) Don't like it, don't read it, but it's literally one story and you're missing out on several amazing Harmony stories that were written for the comp if you click out because of one story.

*** The downvote button isn't a disagree button. We get it, you don't like Snape pairings (I don't either) but that doesn't mean you have to go out of your way to try to hide it from the community and belittle others for liking it.

**** A downvote here is actually legit since OP is promising Harry/Hermione and delivers a Snape pairing. That's like claiming you wrote a completely original story with concepts never seen before and then link a literal copy of CoS on FFN.

******* What? No, I meant someone copy-pasting Chamber of Secrets into FFN and passing it off as their own.

***** Its a single harry/hermione/snape story, technically fits the theme of the group but not really. The rest of the group seems fine

****** Thank you! It's literally one story within hundreds of stories within the group that are just Harry/Hermione! Hope you enjoy the group!
