** Just family secrets does a lot. Like I saw one where the Malfoys kept a spell to resist the imperius locked down to the point even Narcissa didn't know about it, which gave them an edge.

The general concept of trying to preserve tradition by only elevating those who grew up steeped in it is sympathetic to some.

****** Merope was also subjected to horrific abuse and mistreatment by her family. She was so broken by their attitudes towards her that she never really become capable of the discipline, focus, determination nor /belief/ required to practice magic.

It wasn't until her father and brother were removed from the picture and she was freed of their verbal/mental/physical abuse that her talents could even have a chance to prosper.

Merope was not a very powerful nor skilled witch, but she was still a witch. Whatever talents she had, however, were smashed by the horrific way her father and brother treated her as a child, and even when they were gone, she was only mediocre... but when your goal is to bewitch a defenseless Muggle, that's all she needed.

I think a lot of people forget that "magical power" isn't dependant on some internal affinity or anything. People aren't born more powerful than others (excepting the Wizard/Witch vs the non-magical Muggle). All Wizards and Witches are born with the same level of power... it's all a matter of how well you can use that. What constitutes "a powerful wizard" isn't that said wizard has greater strength of innate magical ability but that their refinement of skill and will is higher than others, allowing them to exert the same amount of magic to far greater effect. Consequently, a "weak wizard" is one who is barely able to utilize their magic for even moderate effects. Both wizards have magic, and since one's innate magical gift is not quantizable, it should be treated as a binary value (either "you have it" or "you don't have it"), but the difference in their power is not a result of their blood nor their innate magical capabilities but instead a result of their attitudes, training, and understanding of magic which allows the great wizards to use magic in marvelous ways while the mediocre are unable to grasp magic so effectively.

***** There's also a theory about Tom not being able to feel love because his mom basically date-raped his dad with love potions, I think this is a simile to how conceiving while under the influence of drugs has an adverse effect on the child. Although I'm not too sure if JK said anything about this or not, it makes some form of sense but also he grew up in an orphanage during wartime, he wasn't treated kindly and he had to be ruthless even at a young age just so he wouldn't die so that might have contributed a lot to his sociopathic nature.

** In linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) series, the magic in old families is more /tamed/, easier to control, whereas first-generation magic is wilder and closer to nature. Special gifts might also be passed down in a family and jealously guarded, but the primary verified difference is the ease of control.

(Oh, and the tradeoff is that inbreeding is causing a magical ailment that makes infants after the first child unlikely to survive, thus putting the continuation of wizarding society in jeopardy. It can be averted by mixing in fresh blood every generation or two, even half-blood, but of course the old families aren't keen on that; /toujours pur/.)

*** Kinda, only inherited, magical abilities are fairly rare and much less powerful. They also seem to tend more towards passive effects rather than the active, often offensive nature of Naruto-style Kekkei Genkai.

For example, inherited magical talents like being a Seer, a Metamorphagus, Parseltongue, etc are all passive, difficult to control effects with limited utility in direct confrontation but which are exceedingly useful for esoteric applications. This is likely because most wizards/witches never needed anything more than their magic to fight with - ergo, none of them have direct combat applications.

Comparatively, Naruto's Kekkei Genkai appear to have been genetically breed towards their universe's predisposition towards leveraging unique capabilities in combat which must be activated in order to be utilized. Almost all bloodline-limits were bred specifically to strengthen their power and capabilities for deployment in the field with combat applications.

But, yeah, the whole pure-blood thing might just be a way for people to ensure that specialized, innate magical talents don't die out of the population by ensuring that at least someone's got the genes for it in their DNA, even if they remain recessive.

** My headcanon remains that it is all based on population dynamics: A mugglexmuggle couple produces a magical child a very low percentage of the time (ex: .00001%) of the time, a mugglexmagical couple a low percentage (ex. 25%), and a magicalxmagical a high percentage (ex. 98%).

Thus you have a sociological reason for the division, but there is no "magical power" difference in individuals. Wizarding isolationist culture works better against alternatives, but not because it produces stronger wizards, simply produces more and enough to fuel wizarding society.

I agree with the previous poster that making magic something you can breed better genes into detracts from the message of the series

**** I think you misunderstood. Note I didn't say "pureblood", I said "magical". No difference in squib production between muggleborns and purebloods.

​

I did this math before, although the logic was for a different reason (saying that magical schools don't exist because of magical society, magical society exists because of the magical schools. If you compare taking all the wizardlings and putting them together from 11-18, vs having adult wizards apprentice them, the first model is going to end up with a lot more magical couples, which could allow society to grow/survive). The same logic extends to so that any traditions that happen to promote magicalxmagical couples would have a positive feedback loop. As with real life, the stated reason/benefit doesn't necessarily have to be the reason it is actually working.

As for the math, if you say muggleborns are approximately one in a million, there would be only 66 muggleborns in the UK. Maybe a bit more, since wizards have a longer lifespan than muggles. (This is also roughly .75 per year, which is close to what we seem to see in cannon with a muggleborn per year I think? Maybe make it closer to 1 in 500,000).

Clearly that isn't enough to maintain a separate society. If they don't get with each other, there would be a certain level of half-bloods in society. (at 25% magical children and a generous 3 births per couple, you are talking about only .75 magical children per couple) Thus if all magicals married muggles, the population would still be quite low. (Since each couple consumes 1 magical, you would need a number above 1 for it to be positive).

The math on this one isn't hard, and all magicals marrying muggles, assuming everyone has kids and no-one dies before they do, after maximum population growth, you are looking at 3 magical kids a year (.75 muggleborns, ~2 halfbloods a year).

Clearly not enough to build a society. However, with a higher magical fertility out of magicalxmagical couples, it can overcome the fact you needs two magicals per couple (at 95%, and the same generous 3 births per couple, you get 2.85 magical children per couple. So halfbloods = 1 magical -> .75 magicals, while fullbloods = 2 magicals -> 2.85 magicals).

​

Just for Fun: With the above numbers, if (generation = 20 years):

100% Muggle/Magical Marriages = Maximum 60 magicals/generation, achieved after 33 generations. 30 Generations = 50.99 magicals/year

75% Muggle/Magical Marriages, 25% Magical/Magical Marriages = Maximum 185 magical/generation, achieved after over 100 generations. 30 Generations = 170.08 Magicals/Year

50% Muggle/Magical Marriages, 50% Magical/Magical Marriages = Unbounded Growth, 30 Generations = 1,951.6 Magicals/year

25% Muggle/Magical Marriages, 75% Magical/Magical Marriages = Unbounded Growth, 30 Generations = 54,858.8 Magicals/year

100% Magical/Magical Marriages = Unbounded Growth, 30 Generations = 1,452,572.1 Magicals/year

Of course, perfect fertility is unlikely, these numbers would go down based on how many people die before having kids / not having kids. Plus 3/couple is really high. But even so, it demonstrates how policies that encourage magical/magical couples would generate society that might not work without.

*** Yeah, that basically makes sense of how would the pureblood thing rise up in the first place (better than canon 'fear of muggles' lol).

I mean, given a choice, while being a wizard, would you rather your children be magical or squibs? It's a pretty clear choice.

Also that one gives a plausible explanaition (maybe with different percentages) as to why the world wasn't ovverun by wizards at this point (given how, you know, 8%? of modern population has Genghis Khan somewhere in their family tree), with magic being a natural evolutionary advantage. Bear in mind that witch burning and general aversion to magic IRL is a fairly modern concept stemming mostly from protestants, so if magic was to be real and genetic we'd get a world full of wizards a long time ago.

**** My percentages were based on a premise that magical society would not exist without the magical schools (I think the other thread was "Hogwarts doesn't actually teach things, it is just a way of getting magical couples together" heh), and the idea of, with the current UK population, getting about 1 muggleborn per year.

You almost need something like this to have a 'pureblood' dominated society, if MugglexMagical couples produced Magicals at a decent rate, then they would be MUCH more productive than MagicalxMagical couples (A Muggle/Magical couple only has to produce a single magical to replace its contribution. A Magical/Magical couple has to produce two). In order to do it the other way, you basically have to add non-Hogwarts magical schools or some other explanation on where the rest of the half blood children are.

*** I would actually qualify this math by stating that based on canonical descriptions, magic appears to be a genetically dominant trait. Magical x Muggle appears to always produce a Magical child, suggesting that the gene for magic is a dominant trait... one that sometimes goes recessive at random given the very, very rare occurrence of Squibs.

There is also the issue that magical ability has to be nurtured. If a child ignores their magic or chooses not to explore it, their magic might fade in prominence and strength as it withers from lack of attention or use. It's also possible that the uncontrollable magic of a child is dangerous to those around them, necessitating care and mindfulness when raising a magical child. Thus, the insular nature of the Wizarding World might also be to nurture magical children in an environment where magic is not seen as something strange or unatural, and where any mishaps can be easily mitigated or prevented by older, more experienced magical types. Especially since being raised around magic helps with the whole "not freaking out about doing uncontrollable magic" thing, and allows adult magicals to encourage young children to gain better control over their abilities.

**** I don't think there is too much hard evidence that Magical x Muggle prefers magical children. The viewpoint is a bit skewered (You only see the children who go to Hogwarts), but I suppose halfblood siblings (do we see any) would be evidence?

Regardless, canon has a lot of holes when it comes to doing the math (the economics has it all over), and this would be one of them: If MagicalxMuggle was as productive as MagicalxMagical, they would effectively have twice the magical fertility. (as two magicals can produce twice as many magical kids marrying muggles than each other). It means you have to have other systems for handling the culture difference. (If halfbloods were twice as populous as purebloods, you need some other reason, magical strength, economics, something, that explains the setup).

This just happens to be a nice little bow you can put on it explaining why the structure self-perpetuates.

***** It's possibly also a cultural thing. People might not be inclined to marry those who don't have a similar culture to them as it would cause conflicts when living together and raising a child. Especially since wizards and witches grew up going to the same school together, they're more predisposed to dating other witches and wizards as that's who they were used to being around and dating. Dating a muggle might be a little limiting for them, especially since magic needs to be kept a secret for the safety of magical-kind. So, beyond other factors, it might be more comfortable for some to have a relationship with someone who shares their magical gifts, giving them a commonality and shared history.

*** "Magical power" is not something that's innate to an individual. But everyone's got their own talents for different things: Harry's exceptional at Flying, Ron's got a knack for wizarding chess, Hermione's got a phenomenal memory, and Neville's got an amazing green thumb when it comes to wrangling magical plants.

They all have the same amount of magic as any other wizard or witch, regardless of blood status, because magic is a binary quality - you either have it or you don't. From there, it's all about development of one's magic, which is mainly a result of environment and personal determination to learn.

But specialization and talents for any given field of magic are variable - some subjects are easier to grasp for some people than others. Again, this is likely a question of attitude - if you're the sort of person who is exacting and disciplines and scientific in thought, Transfiguration would come easily to you, but not Divination. Contrastingly, if you're able to deal with abstract ways of looking at magic and extrapolating results from scant data, Divination would be easy for you.

In that sense, all magicals are born equal - blood status plays no role in your magical power and progression to master one's magic and refine one's understanding of the magical arts is a result of training and personal preferences to the various disciplines and subjects involved.

Blood-inherited gifts like Parseltongue or being a Seer, on the other hand, are just unique expressions of different kinds of magic that can't otherwise be learned. They're exceedingly rare, and most magical types will not have these gifts because they only appear in a few bloodlines. Imagine that they're like being innately tall or short - if you play certain sports, being innately tall is an advantage, but that doesn't mean you're better than everyone else - just that you're better at doing some stuff other people aren't. But those other people who aren't as tall or fast as you might be gifted at stuff you aren't.

** The whole point of these books was a very white message that went "racism BAD", while pointing at cartooneske nazi-like villains and the whole story about purebloods vs Muggleborns.

It is very entertaining fantasy, and that is the only reason I can stomach the whole unironic parable with the house elves "wanting to be enslaved", where work is "good for them" and the only deviant voices in this message are ridiculed by the elves (Hermione and Dobby) is because it went all straight over my head when I read the goblet of fire for the first time as a 10 year old European kid that wasn't raised with American civil war history.

This even led to the fanon mental gymnastics where there is something inherently different about house elf magic which needs to be symbiotic with a witch's or wizards magic.

The fanfics where you actually have someone know "the horrors the house elves had committed millennia ago" which made it alright to be horrid to them, or the fanfics where discriminating muggleborns is justified undermine the one core message of these books: "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you; don't be a discriminating piece of excrement."

Basically - to me - the fics where all layers of society abhor the muggleborns for something they can't help, where even the Weasley's are perfectly friendly with muggleborns but taught their children very well to never spawn with them feel wrong in a way that cannot be matched by even the fics where the Weasley's are the dark Lord's staunchest supporters.

Sure I have read them, but I never finished them, let alone put them in my favourites lists.

** i think it is important to note that muggle norms aren't necessarily from families that have had no magical ability. they can be descendants form magical families who had a squib who then had children and then they had muggle a children until the magic was found generations later. in that sense it would be perfectly reasonable in my opinion for them to have magical talents like being a seer or a metamorphmagus. although it really depends on how strong these genetics are and if magical genes work similarly to human genetics.
