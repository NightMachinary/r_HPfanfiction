Who doesn't love having a badass rhyming Demon in your head that talks in rhyme and needs poetry to be invoked. Etrigan is awesome.

Gives Harry a cool power, and the ability to make Voldemort not a chump who loses to a Deus Ex Machina, and actually a threat that requires an actual battle before he gets taken down... and the ability to make rhymes that would make Kirabi from Naruto jealous.


** The closest your going to get to this is linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) and its respective sequels. No rhymes, but a ton of fire.

  By the age of seven, Harry Potter hated his home, his relatives and his life. However, an ancient demonic artefact has granted him the powers of a Fallen and now he will let nothing stop him in his quest for power. AU: Slight Xover with Dresden Files

** I had a recent challenge where I went the opposite way where Voldemort was using demons to sow fear and chaos, ends up sending a one after Harry who while fighting and losing begs for a chance to beat it and becomes Angelic Shazam.
