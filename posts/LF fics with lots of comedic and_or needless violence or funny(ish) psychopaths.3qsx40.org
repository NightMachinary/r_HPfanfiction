Yes I am aware of the Seventh Horcrux. That story is amazing.

Other examples of the thing I'm looking for include [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9118123/1/To-Play-the-Devil][To Play the Devil]] which is Harry Potter and Voldemort in a semi-serious buddy cop storyline trying to solve some mysterious disappearances.

Also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8192853/1/Yes-I-am-Harry-s-Brother][Yes I am Harry's Brother]] where Voldemort grabs himself a body that looks like Harry Potter and pretends to be Harry's illegitamate American brother Vito. (the story is WAY better than it sounds and that's saying a lot considering the premise is already pretty amazing.)

  'Picking pockets is such a useful skill,' Harry thought to himself, 'it's like the gift that keeps on giving.'

I think I'm gonna like this story.

Edit:

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore frowned as he read the paper. 'Shame about the Dursley family, but so long as the boy's cousin survived then all would be well.'

  He smiled as he read that Dudley would be taken in by his Aunt Marge, no doubt the wards had prevented the paper from mentioning Harry. Dumbledore decided to reward himself with a lemon drop. 'Damn, I'm good.'

I'm definitely liking this story.

  When Loki fell from the Bifrost he was expecting the cool embrace of oblivion, not to become a spirit and then be ripped apart and forced into the mind of a six year-old named Harry Potter. With no physical form, he must keep the boy alive if he seeks to keep existing, and everyone knows that the best way to ensure continued survival is to simply become greater than everyone else.

  Sirius breaks out of Azkaban two years before schedule. He's pissed, half-mad and prepared to do anything to protect his Godson. He's going to make the Wizarding world pay for the hell it put him through- and have some fun along the way, of course! Super! Sirius, Dark Lord! Sirius, but not evil. No slash. May include ships later. Mainly from Sirius' (and Harry's) point of view. AU.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4605681/1/The-Real-Us][The Real Us]] is funny and all the main characters are basically psychopaths or sociopaths.

However, fair warning, there are bits that need to be skipped. I.e eleven year old Harry and Hermione going down on each other. Like wtf. Also really lazy Weasley bashing. The rest is still decently entertaining and humorous for a decent mindless read
