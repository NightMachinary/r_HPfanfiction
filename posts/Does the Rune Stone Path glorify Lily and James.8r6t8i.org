Rune Stone Path does a lot of stuff right. The mentor/adoptive mother relationship with Shiva was a joy to read and I would wish to see more like that. The whole resurrection of Lily and the resulting conflict/slow acceptance from Harry was also rather good. The story does not glorify James, if anything it throws some shade his way. Lily is shown as smart, but not flawless.

It is the best harem story around, but it would have been a lot better without the inclusion of Daphne Greengrass or the whole pureblood contract/consort thing. Fleur and Tonks make a decent couple on their own in the story, so it is not just Harry/arm candy, but having the two couples (Harry/Hermione and the aforementioned FD/NT) grow slowly together instead of centred around Harry would have been a huge improvement.

*** How smart are Lily and Harry though? Are they 'no one can match me drool because of my brains I have all outstanding and Dumbeldore hates me' level of smart? Or just intelligent in a select few subjects while being a bit average at others? I don't think I'll be reading it since James was described (along with Sirius) as the very top of their year and they're dragged down in this fic and it's a harem, so no.

**** More the second. Harry is smart at Runes, perhaps the best one in the entire universe. He tries to replace everything with Runes and succeeds more often than not. But it has its drawbacks. He gets cocky, he neglects other branches of magic, it makes him vulnerable at times.

Lily is interesting. In some ways, she is a broken person. She has been through some bad shit, her relationship with James was failed at the end. She is smart, but nowhere near as bad as your average OP!Harry.

How is she going to be a savant so early when Nicholas Flamel and Dumbledore literally took over a century for them to be that distinguished - Voldemort less than half. It's very common to make her their level when she was only that young. James, of course, is forgotten. Hell, I don't think she'd have even reached Snape's level had she or any of the Marauders lived!

Worse yet is Harry being at that level when he's only 17. Like I get being talented is nice but don't make him too overpowered. And /of course/ he's going to be more powerful and much more talented than Hermione because how can you make his love interest more than a trophy wife.

She was talented, but I don't think anyone reached Dumbledore/Riddle/Grindelwald type of talented. So I'd say she and James would be a bit like The Longbottoms had they lived - someone who was renowned but not mindblowingly talented to the point of making Voldemort seem like nothing or make Dumbledore stare in awe. After all, Riddle was supposed to be a very rare and puzzling case of a prodigy.

I think her grades would probably be 4 O's and 4 E's with two A's or 6 E's. That'd firmly be in the category of 'talented' and someone who could easily become a healer or auror.

******* Yeah, but if we want to make her a super talented person then so should Sirius, James and Snape. Because these three were the top. But then that makes Dumbledore and Voldemort something akin to a god in the eyes of people. Because if you want to raise someone to a higher level then the already more talented ones should be raised to higher levels as well. Because these were canoncially more talented and /if you want/ to be canon-compliant then they shouldn't be reduced to nothing compared to Lily, as they are the overwhelming majority of the time.

So I think she was talented but she should also have weaknesses, like everyone else!

***** Not to put too fine of a point on this, but its worth pointing out how incompetent the majority of the wizarding world actually is compared to savants like Voldemort and Dumbledore. Seriously, everyone thought an acromantula was petrifying people and maybe that Hagrid, a half-giant, was actually the heir of Slytherin.

Voldemort gets away with a lot of his activities because magical people don't really think to much about evidence or facts (for any number of reasons). This is one of the reasons only Dumbledore really figured out how Voldemort survived in 1981 (besides the fact that horcruxes are very obscure and dangerous dark magic with little apparent study material).

Anyway, the idea that Lily, or possibly Harry under different circumstances, could be fairly talented or even savants in a specific field isn't too far out of the realm of believability (if you ignore or stretch canon a fair amount of course). Canon seems to indicate that most wizards/witches have natural inclinations toward specific "sub-branches" of magic (ex. Ollivander's explanation of wands being better at certain magics). Like Harry in linkffn(The Art of Self-Fashioning), it is not impossible to see either of them focusing on a particular branch of magic at the expense of all other forms. Something similar to the Jedi Weaponmasters in the Star Wars EU.

I doubt this. Slughorn at the very least suggested Lily was Snape's equal in Potions and given her wand's aptitude at charms and her apparent ability to control her magic without a wand as a kid (something only Riddle is shown to have done), I have a hard time thinking she didn't (or would never) surpass the Marauders and Snape. Lupin, for instance, refers to her as a "singularly gifted witch" and Voldemort wanted to recruit her (before the Prophecy) despite being a Muggleborn, so her potential ceiling appears to have been very high.

***** I'm not convinced. For the fact we don't actually have concrete evidence. Is it actually stated anywhere in the books that having a wand good for something makes someone good at the subject themselves? Besides, charms is described as very light and fun compared to actually hard subjects like transfiguration.

I think by now control over underage magic isn't that unusual, it's how you /use/ it is what makes it unusual. For example, Riddle concerned Dumbledore because he was a little psycho child and was strangling bunnies before reaching ten years old, not because he had control over it! There are three Canon characters that have control of it (Lily, McGonagall and Riddle).

Besides, as I recall Hagrid says in book one that Voldemort didn't try to recruit her so very early.

She's nowhere described even as close as Snape. If she was that talented at such a young age I think Harry would have heard a lot more about his mother's talent because people wouldn't pass up an opportunity to talk about her.

As for Lupin, a lot of people don't consider the movies Canon. I know I don't.

Meanwhile, there's no reason to believe she was more talented than Emmeline Vance, Molly Weasley and Dorcas Meadowes. To me Lily, Molly and Emmeline all line up behind Dorcas and Amelia Bones. She's as skilled as Tonks, who was also 21/22 when the story started and an auror.

We have absolutely no evidence she would have surpassed Snape and The Marauders.

******* Not really, no. Only Hagrid and Slughorn describe her as smart and only McGonagall and Lupin describe James as such. You also need to take into account that they're talking, especially Hagrid (except McGonagall) about their orphaned son whom they died to save. They're famous and very young war heroes and of course they're going to be exaggerated in front of their son. Slughorn is also very fishy and will likely exaggerate his relationship with Lily because when she died she became famous for being the mother of Harry Potter.

I think he liked her but she didn't. He jumps at every opportunity to gain recognition and of course he's going to jump on the chance to be connected to Harry via Lily, who he liked.

It's only natural both she and James are going to be exaggerated and you have to take everything said by a grain of salt.

******** Hagrid, Slughorn and Lupin say such about her. There's no reason for them to exaggerate in a consistent manner, we even /see/ her controlling her magic before knowing what it is. Slughorn didn't exaggerate his relationship with her, he simply said she was one of the most brilliant students he ever taught. In fact, he suggests she was fond of being cheeky with him, so its not like he pretended of be a great friend or mentor of Lily's.

I never doubted her potions abilities - but if Slughorn said she could brew a potion that has to be brewed on a week in one day then that's exaggeration. Slughorn loved Lily. What if she was cheeky with him? He cried when her death was mentioned.

Even James's Quidditch skills have to be exaggerated. Controlling your magic at a young age has no bearing on anything used afterwards. Dumbledore can barely use wandless magic. Voldemort shocked everyone when he did and Lupin was the only one who could actually use it in the books.

As far as I'm concerned, her abilities in fanfiction are very overrated and way over the top.

This is not about a character's morality (which may well be bleached clean after death), it's about their talent.

Yes she can have a wandless talent as a child (we have no indication of her wandless talent as an adult, but since the ones we know like McGonagall and Riddle rarely used it, I'm going to say it went away as she bonded with her wand and grew used to it) but she had an idea it was magic, just like Riddle. After all if you can do all that aren't you going to go 'maybe it's magic?'?

Anyway when I say she's overrated this is what I mean. A long time ago in a fic I dropped immediately she can apparate at fourteen, use no wand at all, the thrice defied was only applied to her while James did nothing but stare as she dueled Voldemort and bested him while the Order gaped, got all 'O's without studying and was the real Half-Blood Prince and Snape only stole everything she wrote down while watching her like a hawk, she can fly before Voldemort can all while she's only 21. Bested everyone at their own games as well and dueled Dumbledore and made him go like 'oh my god'.

If that's not ridiculous I don't know what is. My point is that she'd be as skilled and talented as Tonks when she died. I think that's believable enough and fits with what we know about her.

Well, ok, fanfic authors do lots of silly things. I never said Lily could do all those things. :P But from what we saw and we're told, she was almost definitely above Tonks. Had she lived, my guess is she'd be around the level of maybe Bellatrix (who was supposed to be the strongest Death Eater)

I think you're underrating Tonks here - she's very smart and became an auror (just look at the requirements) but I think that's overshadowed by her light and bubbly personality but she's very deadly. So at the time of her death she's like Tonks (who was very talented and mentored by Moody himself) but I think if she and Tonks had lived they'd both be like Emmeline Vane - highly talented, takes a couple of Death Eaters to take them down and a heavy blow to the Order but they can carry on without her.

James, Sirius and Snape at the least were known to be near the top (if not the top, according to Lupin), so I doubt anyone else was above her.

You'd basically have to think she bombed her other classes, which is doubtful. Also, the point about the Patronus is simple. James's wand is known to be good for transfiguration. This hints at a natural talent for it, which is verified by how young he managed to become an animagus. Similarly, Lily's wand is good at charms, and all of Lily's controlled magic before Hogwarts were charms. Her casting a corporeal Patronus (which, btw, only a few in the DA managed, not most) is proof of that. Also, according to Rowling, a corporeal Patronus is an indicator of superior magic ability.

It's not impossible but it's implausible. As an example, Draco was a known blood purist and son of a Death , yet he was made Prefect strangely enough. Would he have been Head? No clue, but it's not a complete disqualification. Lily was stated and shown in numerous ways to be exceptional at magic and near the top of her class, so I don't see it as unreasonable to suggest what I have previously.

Funnily enough, becoming an Animagus requires more of a talent in potions than transfiguration. The only bit of actually transforming is the final achievement but you need to make the Animagus potion fit it. So Sirius and James might as well have been right behind Lily and Snape in potions class.

But Draco was made a prefect by Snape and Slughorn was the head at that time. Slughorn wasn't that biased. And Dumbledore would never put a blood purist on top.

Lily was repeatedly said to be one of the top in potions, not the top of the class. I'm sure, had she been, we would have known since no one passed an opportunity to tell Harry all about how awesome his parents were. I think it's plausible enough that she wasn't the very top.

All three together adds up to definite charms excellence.

Animagus transformation only require a single potion taken at the end. The process requires one to say an incantation everyday until a thunderstorm comes along. That's a lot more of a requirement for Transfiguration than Potions. James and Sirius were near or at the top in transfiguration, which again matches James's wand. Wands seem to do this, likely it's part of how they pick their initial owner.

Um, I'm pretty sure Dumbledore picked prefects. At the very least he suggested to Harry that he didn't get the prefect badge because he (Dumbledore) thought he had enough going on at the time.

What I'm saying is that if she was top in potions (from Slughorn, it's very unlikely anyone but Snape edged her out) and in Charms (from the above examples, not just her wand) then it's almost certain she was near or at the top. And I don't see why people would keep mentioning it. The only time it was mentioned for James was once by Lupin. She might not have been the very top, but there's nothing I've seen that suggests she was just incapable of or clearly below Snape and the Marauders.

I still don't see how that proves she's the top since Sirius and James both could also cast the patronus and were very skilled at charms as evidenced by the Map. They might as well be the top too if we're going to apply the same argument. We're taking her talent as an individual, not as a group of people.

No, Dumbledore says it's extremely unusual, to the point of being unsettling, to control one's magic so early and without a wand. Arianna Dumbledore is the perfect example. She couldn't show those muggles the magic she did by accident. McGonagall wasn't controlling her magic that early, we are just told of her accidental magic; Lily was doing it consciously.

Lily is almost definitely behind Amelia Bones, if only because Bones lived much longer and was shown to be near Voldemort's level from the evidence Fudge mentioned. But there's little chance Molly or Dorcas were, at 21, on Lily's level. Unless we're picking a lucky shot on Bellatrix as aptitude.

I've given ample evidence she was either above them or no lesser than them.

******* There's no evidence Dorcas or Molly weren't as skilled as Lily - or her being more skilled for that matter - at her age. Molly was a very talented witch and there's nothing to suggest that she wasn't more so than Lily. So you're suggesting Lily at 21 is better than Amelia Bones when she died? Voldemort personally went after both Dorcas and Amelia. Molly bested Bellatrix.

If she had lived, her as well as Tonks, that long I would say they would have become like Amelia. But I think she'd be like Tonks when she died.

McGonagall did use wandless magic on purpose, it's stated in her biography.

******** There's nothing to suggest Molly's aptitude at all one or or the other. Whereas with Lily we have half a dozen or more examples. And no, I literally just said Amelia Bones is much more talented than Lily. We know Bones could and did go toe to toe with Voldemort. Molly "bested" Bellatrix in much the way that Harry "bested" Voldemort as a baby: a lucky shot. Bellatrix is quite clearly shown to be laughing and thus not defending herself. That scene was quite clearly trying to parallel Sirius's death.

In her biography, it says she was inadvertently (i.e. not on purpose) controlling her cat and summoned books and such. Lily was purposefully slowing her fall and using telekinesis on flowers.

********* Rowling herself said she thinks Molly was very talented. No one can raise that family - especially Fred and George - with no talent at magic. She was also in the Order, although for what I'm not sure and was trusted on guard duty at the Ministry. She appeared to have an aptitude for potions since we see Harry hearing her tell a story about her brewing a love potion. And I think she'd have brewed a few potions in her time as a mother as well.

In the wiki, when you open the intentional category, McGonagall is listed there, controlling her magic as a baby, inadvertently, but she had a goal (like the toys) and summoned them. A baby isn't going to know what magic is, after all.

********** I didn't say she had no talent, just that her aptitude was never praised in the way many others were. Also, the love Potion isn't saying much. Romilda Vane did it as, like, a fourth or fifth year.

Look, you just quoted the word: inadvertently. That means she wasn't using the magic on purpose, it was the usual accidental magic. Lily, like Riddle, could and did use wandless magic on purpose as a kid.

So I guess she's as talented as Riddle now is she?

************ Ah, my mistake. Merope Gaunt seemed to get it down without issue though.

No, it's just an indicator she had a natural gift for magic. Riddle seemed to be able to do all sorts of things (controlling people, inflicting pain, etc.), while Lily seemed to mostly use movement charms (floating, making flowers move).

************* Merope was likely talented but as we see from the memories, had everything of interest shut down by her father and brother. She was the only one keeping the house running, so we gotta give her some credit. So she was likely good at potions. She had no support. With both gone I think she'd have space to brew a potion.

Oh my god, Riddle was a sicko even as a child. Ugh. Can't Rowling have made an eleven year old kid a bit more... human? Less of a psycho? A bit more of a, you know, child. As an adult yes but as a kid too.
