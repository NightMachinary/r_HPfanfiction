Hey guys!

Huge fan of the Marauders world within the HP world! I have read The Rise and Fall, The Bet, the Tears on the balcony series and the Life and Times.

Do you have any more long, Rated R, well written (possibly heavy on the Jily) more? Angsty... or not, would love some help in collecting some new ones!


** Here's a couple:

  James celebrates Christmas by drugging himself on powdered thestral-hoof (as a joke), Remus visits Madagascar (it's sunny and it brings out his freckles), Peter takes up smoking (and quits), and Sirius flat-out refuses to read Nature's Nobility ever again (he would also like to make it clear that he detests the Christmas decorations in Grimmauld Place).  This version of events takes place from December 1975 to April 1976. There were some animals hurt in the telling of this story, but the boys would like to ensure you that the Giant Squid isn't one of them.

  While war brews on the horizon beyond the walls of Hogwarts, the infamous Triwizard Tournament resurfaces just in time for the Marauders' seventh year. When the students of Beauxbatons Academy and Ilvermorny School arrive, the champions are in for three unprecedented challenges. Meanwhile, Remus still has feelings, James is still trying to get the (Head) girl, and Sirius has revelations.

Love, power, Marauders, and everything in between. Year 7 with opening Snily and eventual Jily. Prequel to "Clean" and "Marked," book III in "This World or Any Other" series. COMPLETE.

** linkffn(all the young dudes)

SERIOUSLY good. It's written from Remus' POV and has great characterization of him and the other marauders.

  Also published on AO3 (same author, same title): Wolfstar get together fic charting the Marauder's time at Hogwarts from Remus' POV. Obviously a Remus/Sirius fic, but loads of general marauders mischief and fun in the first few years. A few diversions from canon - working class/orphaned Remus.

#+begin_quote
  After her husband is unfaithful and her cookie-cutter perfect world is turned on its head, Petunia Evans Dursley finds herself in her old hometown, full of regrets and feeling that her life has been without purpose. Before she can quietly take her own life, she is given an impossible offer by a long-dead figure from the magical world: return to the past, and rewrite her own history. Seeing it as a chance to make up for her biggest regret, Petunia accepts and finds herself in the middle of a Wizarding war she knew little about, protecting the younger sister she tried to forget by seeking help from the one person in the magical world she knows how to find.A what-if story beginning in the latter years of the first war against Voldemort, where an unlikely alliance turns into an even more unlikely romance, and the bonds that bloom from it will change the course of Wizarding history.
