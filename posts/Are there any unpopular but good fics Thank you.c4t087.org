** Understand that these are fics I think are unpopular, but believe are written well enough that they deserve overall to be labeled as good. Others can and will disagree, as they should.

Linkffn(Black Luminary): a slooooow build, but the writer generally has built a unique AU and it's relatively entertaining, if occasionally over-the-top.

Linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle: A Harry Potter Adventure): this is an entertaining read, but lots of people can't deal with the 2nd person perspective.

Linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent): a great, if only 2/3 complete, AU from the post-gof days.

  The war against the Dark Lord was the last straw. The oppressed, fed up with oligarchy, corruption, and injustice, sharpened their knives, rallying behind those who promised change. They won. Today, Magical Britain is a changed country -- for the better. Hail and praise to our saviours! Finally, all is well. But listen! Can't you hear the grindstone turning still ...?

** I don't think I ever see these recommended here:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6563043/1/The-Real-Memory][The Real Memory]]. Harry died, goes to a different world where magic doesn't exist, died again, repeat a few times. What make this fanfiction great is how the author can make us wonder 'What the fuck is happening?' at the same time as Harry does.\\
  Most of the alternate world is Muggle!AU though, so YMMV.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13912332/chapters/32017587][sleeper]]. Harry goes to a different world when he sleeps. The characterization, the trio (plus Ginny) mechanics, and the (kinda) mystery in this fanfiction is amazing. Although the ending is a bit disappointing.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15687453/chapters/36450108][proof]]. The usual Harry takes over the Wizengamot fanfiction, but he also bakes Rhubarb Tart, Lemon and Almond Ricotta Biscuits, and a three other desserts. A fun and quick read.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7914675/1/Mother-s-Love][Mother's Love]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8512041/1/Normal][Normal]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9992638/1/Settling][Settling]]. AU where only James lived and Lily enters an abusive (well, for Harry) relationship with Snape.

These are the ones that doesn't get recommended enough:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12424344][Grey Space]]. AU where Harry goes to Stonewall High because Hogwarts start at 14.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3916129][you will bleed to death with the pain of it]]. Harry-Tom soulmarks. It's not what you thinks, trust me.

When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright.

  "He isn't my real father, but he's the only one I've got," Harry said miserably. "And he hates me." "He doesn't," she whispered, but then could say no more. Lily begins to see. Answer to Bratling's Survival Challenge.
