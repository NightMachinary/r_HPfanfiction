As you know, while he was a arrogant jerk, Sirius wasn't racist or anything like that, and openly despised his family for it's racism and being pricks.

I kinda want to see a SI in a similar situation, as well as with the interesting question of a kin who is a asshole but love you and so reject it is not easy, like in the story of Calista Snape (who is a great story btw).

Thought, not too much something like "my family is bad but actually good", i can imagine that and it's frankly meh at best.

Not a member of the Black/Malfoy/Lestrange family or something similar to this, it's too easy (if you want, someone who's family is from a other country than the united kingdom or Ireland).
