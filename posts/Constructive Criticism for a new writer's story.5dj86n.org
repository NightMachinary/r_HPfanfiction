I've been writing little bits for a while now, but this is the first I've published to ff.net.

#+begin_quote
  Thomas Riddle, more commonly known as Lord Voldemort, sat upon his throne at the head of a grand table in the manor's grand meeting hall.
#+end_quote

This makes him seem like he's stuffed full of himself. Ego over substance.

#+begin_quote
  He was waiting for his inner circle
#+end_quote

A Dark Lord does not wait for mere followers. Followers wait for the Dark Lord.

#+begin_quote
  His inner circle composed of Arcturus Sweeney, Albus Sweeney, Andromeda Sweeney, Arcturus Black, Orion Black, Cygnus Black, Rolf Lestrange, Alberich Lestrange, Rolf Lestrange II, Rolondo Lestrange, Roduslev Lestrange, Baruslev Lestrange, Futhark Lestrange, Herakles Jude, Abraxas Malfoy, Eileen Prince, Plato Pritchard, Antonin Dolohov, Lech Dolohov, Evan Rosier I, Lucian Nott, Martom Mulciber, Harlan Granger, and Iacomus Avery.
#+end_quote

Giant list of characters I don't have a reason to care about.

#+begin_quote
  Everyone except Arcturus, Abraxas, Rolf, and Lech cheered. the group then apparated away.
#+end_quote

The Dark Lord waited on his followers for six sentences of generic exhortation. It's too short for a campaign speech, and it's targeting his current loyal followers anyway. What's the point of the meeting? Boosting Tom's ego a little more?

There was no signal to end the meeting.

The transition is a bit unclear.

#+end_quote

What exactly constitutes a rock venue?

#+begin_quote
  Eleven thousand, two hundred sixty three muggles would die.
#+end_quote

In a town of six thousand.

#+begin_quote
  The last dying from her injuries nearly forty years later.
#+end_quote

Forty years?

He is. Voldemort's ego is bigger than all of Hogwarts.

** I feel like there is too much unnecessary description. There are lots of names, dates and random facts with very little action or anything really going on making it really hard to read and understand. I would go through and cut down on the background information that is not directly relevant to what you are describing. For example, the first few paragraphs on the Riddle home/family, death eater names and descriptions could easily be cut out and not change the story at all at this point. You could always add the background later in the story as needed.

** I'd agree with the comments about lists of characters, it simply isn't necessary. If we need to know who they are, their motivations etc. then this should be revealed through the narrative. Good luck with your writing.

*** As I recall, Slughorn asks Hermione is she's related to some wizard whose last name is Dagworth-Granger, so the name apparently exists in the wizarding world.
