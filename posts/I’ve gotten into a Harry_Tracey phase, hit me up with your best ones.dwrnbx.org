  AU. The Dursley's abuse takes it's toll on a young Harry. On the train to Hogwarts, he meets another damaged and abused soul; high society waif Tracey Davis. Two injured souls fall in young love and conspire to escape their painful existence - even if it means framing their guardians and fleeing their homeland.

Doesn't seem to be on FFN anymore, but I think it was once upon a time.
