I'm really on the vibe of Harry and Draco as good friends, but also kind of their more canon-selves. Gryffindor Harry and Slytherin Draco, more post war friends or partners but not slash. I've read The Elite and the 8th Year, and I'd love something similar if anyone can recommend something for me!

Pretty heavy romance (Harry/Daphne) focus from memory, but Draco is his Auror partner
