I imagen that Magic causes his traps to work the way he thinks they are supposed to work instead of being leathal. With his traps almost being basic rituals that he imbues magic into as he set them up. harry and marv could also be Squibs or weak wizards , it would explain their superhuman durability. considering how they could walk away from stuff like a brick to the face from multiple stories up and others that would kill any muggle.


** I could easily believe it of Harry and Marv.

**** Could be like a thrill thing. He has money and power from his name, and he got addicted to the adrenaline. Now hes retired he got antsy and by coincidence ran into one of Dudley's old Harry Hunting gang who's down in his luck. So he decides to help him rob muggle homes.

Only needs a tiny bit of retconning the most dangerous trap to hit harry and have marv only get some minor ones.
