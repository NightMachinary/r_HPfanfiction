  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!

** I am going off the US legal system---and UK and wizards might have it differently---but I don't think the burden of proof regarding the Dementors would have been on the Ministry. All they needed to prove was that the spell had been cast, which was something that Harry and his team never contested. It was up to Harry and his team to provide an /affirmative defence/ by proving that there were Dementors present.
