Looking for ideas for my new and first fic, linkffn(Worth It) (btw, please drop a review if you get the chance, either here or on ffnet).

I've read all of the fics in my profile page/favs (I would link them here but there are too many) and most of them have great magic.

But just for a quick idea, off of the top of my head - things like Emperor, Wit of the Raven, /all/ of Joe's stuff, Magics of the Arcane, and Shezza's Denarian trilogy.

Hard-hitting, enthralling, and visceral magic scenes. Give me your best!


** I care more for strong characters more than magic, but linkffn(Ectomancer) has some unique elements of magic that I absolutely love. It is my favorite DLP fic, and I highly recommend it.

Also, linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent) has a well defined magic system that forms a major part of the story, and ties it in with canon-ish themes of love and forgiveness. Any stories that keep to canon themes get an automatic +1 from me.

*** Thanks for the recs. I certainly do care for strong characters, but reading really well-written magic adds a /lot/ to a fic for me, and more often than not is the mark of a good story.

**** I don't quite like how Harry comes across as "Super" later on, but they way the magic is dealt with is just beautiful and awe-inspiring and I can kind of see how it got there so I don't have as much of an issue with it.

***** I liked /Blindness/, but I really think that linkffn(With Strength of Steel Wings), AngelaStarCat's other long fic is superior, particularily in this aspect. The magic is just as visceral (if not more so) but the particulars of Harry's path to power mean that there are inherent weaknesses that accompany his strength so he's never entirely OP. The first part does drag a bit, but once it picks up it becomes one of my all-time favorite fics.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
