No bashing. I want to read some fics where Ron feels like he overshadowed by Harry and Hermione and decides to go on his own adventure, career, etc but still remains friends/keeps in contact with them until the end.


** Positive views of Ron? You're the best <3 take an upvote!

I don't /mind/ a bit of Ron bashing now and then (especially in crack) but I think it's such a waste of potential for his character.

** Have you read HP and the New Day Dawning?

It has a brilliant Ron. He doesn't leave Harry or Hermione's sphere of influence as such but he has overcome the fear of being overshadowed. I'm just about to reread it now because all I could remember is that Ron played the accordion. Which turned out to be wrong he plays the concertina...so time for a re-read.

** I feel like you'll get the stories you're looking for in the post-canon/pre-NextGen window. Considering that in canon, there weren't adventures as much as Harry's fight for survival and the multitude of Ron-bashing, I would be surprised to see good Ron works.

But with post-canon, you get a Ron that's maturing and looking to find his own path through life, and may have his own adventures.

I don't really know of any fics like what you're looking for, but I hope this helps you narrow down your search if you can!

*** I've actually only know one post canon fic with this premise that i read was "Stay Standing." Really enjoyed that one. Thanks for shortening the search but i was kinda hoping for some fics during canon.

**** Any good canon Ron fics tend to be slice of life. Ron's biggest influence is his family, specifically that he had a wizarding one, and ron fics reflect that.

If you can't find any, write one! Maybe Ron goes on a summer adventure with Bill before 3rd year?
