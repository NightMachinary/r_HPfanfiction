What I'm looking for are lots of fics where the main character is a lesbian but with that not being the sum total of the plot. Basically the fact that they are a lesbian has to be a smaller part of a larger fic.

Clarifying the the rest of the title it's in case, I would prefer a character other then a female version of Harry to be centric from a good oc/si to a redone character from the original.

Finally, one good example of what I'm looking for is Uchiha of Ravenclaw which is basically a crossover with a female oc replacement of Sasuke in an au where they (her and Itachi) both worked together to get most of their clan executed for treason instead of massacred and saved a few who where not involved.


** Well there was that one fic that had Hermione go to Harry with "Harry I think I like girls" and he responds with "Good, I do too".

I know it was a subpoint and I remember liking the scene, but since that is the only thing I can remember about the fic, it probably wasn't that good...

*** Sound pretty nice and I've read something similar before but with Hermione going to the past and Bella before she was a death eater so this should be a nice alternative of that.

** Black Ink Red Rose qualifies. Ginny's romantic relationships really aren't the focus of this fic. The author did a plug for it awhile back (below) and just recently finished the whole thing. Really, really dark. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/byzws2/looking_for_a_dark_ginny_shameless_selfrec/]]

** Also I just found a fic that was so close to what I wanted but did a last minute sideways jump that I felt I should post it here for those looking for similar rec's

  Try as she might, Ginny can't make herself stop loving Tom. The knowledge of his true identity doesn't prevent the memories of how wonderful he was from consuming her thoughts. Even though it makes her a monster, she can't stop thinking about him. And if the opportunity to help him came up, well. She was always told to listen to her heart. Eventual Ginny/Bellatrix

** Also I'm quite fond of lesbian ‘players' as characters where they are in several different relationships over the course of the fic (though not cheating on anyone) or in open relationship, as I believe in free love and jazz .
