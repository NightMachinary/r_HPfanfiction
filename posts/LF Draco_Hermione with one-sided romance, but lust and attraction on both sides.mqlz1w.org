I want to know fics that have both are attracted to each other and maybe even lusting. They have some sex sessions, but while over time Draco feels more than lust and begins to develop romantic feelings, Hermione just wants to have sex/fun with him.

It doesnt even have to be that Draco has romantic feelings, but in any case, they sleep with each other. So smut should definetely be included. It would be good, if she is the dominant or the one who initiates it.
