Basically the title. Looking for a fic where Harry successfully runs away from the Dursleys for at least a decent chunk of his childhood (a few years) before he goes to Hogwarts. Preferably H/Hr once schooling starts and decent in length.

Edit: Forgot to mention. It's a rather specific request, but there was another fanfic I read the other day where we are told Harry had run away and during that time he had begun to work out how to use accidental magic... well on purpose magic I guess... wandless magic, whatever. Sadly it was just mentioned as having happened in the past (he was later Obliviated), but it seemed like a fun idea for a fic. Not exactly a Riddle-esque Harry (no need to go dark), but using magic to survive on the streets before going to Hogwarts sounds like a fun premise to shake up what happens once he enters the wizarding world. Maybe I ought write it myself someday, lol.


** Not H/Hr but they are the main characters

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

  Harry decided growing up “on the street” was better than at the Dursleys and ran away as a child, becoming lost to the Wizarding world. He was very happy with his life until accidentally found by Albus Dumbledore... No real pairing

  Harry Potter would never regret running away as a child, but two years living on the hard streets of London had taken its toll. Now almost thirteen, Harry is still struggling to survive when a split-second decision gives him a chance at happiness. But will he take that chance, or will his past haunt him forever? AU story.

  What if instead of locking Harry in his cupboard whenever they didn't want to look at him, the Dursley's had locked him out of the house instead? Maybe this. Self-Sufficient, Independent!Harry.

  Tiboldt's Family Circus brings together two birds of a feather. The world tries to tear them apart. (Rated M for some foul language later on in the story. No ship - or I suppose, any ship you want to see.)
