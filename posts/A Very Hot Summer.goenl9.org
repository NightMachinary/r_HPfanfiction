With summer approaching, I've been itching to read one of my all-time favorite fics, A Very Hot Summer by jrb2009. Unfortunately I discovered that this author had deleted all works off of their fanfiction.net account. I've pmed them on ff.net, but I don't know if they're still active. Does anyone know if there's a website with another copy or has someone downloaded it? It's a Hermione/Cormac fic based at a muggle summer camp called Camp Craig Much Love and Happy Reading H <3


** Tried to find his stories too, but he seems to have done a very good job of erasing all traces of his work from the internet.

He removed them from all sites and they even got removed from fictionhunt, at his request I guess. And the waybackmachine doesn't have them either for some reason. So I fear your only chance would be if someone has an offline copy saved.
