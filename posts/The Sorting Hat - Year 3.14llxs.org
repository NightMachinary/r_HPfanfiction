** A note on the story: I had a lot of suggestions to deviate more from the canon. I agree that as the story progresses for SlytherinHarry increasing deviation would become inevitable. But I think it is more interesting to follow the book's plotlines rather than simply make things up. It is especially satisfying to make different occurrences come to the same ends. For example, by changing the Buckbeak incident I was able to still have the Quidditch Dementor event happen - where otherwise it would have been impossible.

For the author, definitely. And the reader can participate a little bit through appreciation (and potentially pleasant surprise) at how well new circumstances things tie back in with the familiar. But just as a way of explanation... You probably had a lot of suggestions to deviate from canon because fanfic readers know the story; plus, we've already read many stories that don't deviate from canon. We like something new (which the rest of the plot does provide). (: Just offered as a way of explanation, not of criticism.

I still vote for you expanding your synopses/stories into chaptered fanfic, but if you don't have the time or inclination to do so, please continue with self posts! Also, if you expanded the stories, you would be able to build more tension, possibly making the reader's participation in "different occurrences with the same ends" more enjoyable.
