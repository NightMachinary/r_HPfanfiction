I'm getting a little stuck when it comes to Occlumency in my fic.

When someone is Occluding, what is it that the Legilimens will see in their mind? What do you like to emphasize when writing Occlumency? What do you like to read about it as a reader?

I'm also up for any fic recs about Occlumency if you have ‚Äòem! :) Thanks!


** Quoting my previous post on the topic:

#+begin_quote
  What do you think a good system of legilimency/occlumency is? I find the "mindscape" system to be the worst and making no sense whatsoever. Of course nothing is going to make perfect sense in a story about magic, but I find that "mindscapes are too much". People create a world in their mind that they have perfect control over and place traps. Legilimency users use legilimency to enter this world and fight these traps while the occlumency user defends. What? Why on earth would you bother creating more traps when you can literally change the world around the legilimency user to force them out? Why on earth would you even place memories out in the open as opposed to a vault? This is only the tip of the iceberg as well.

  For me, I think the best system of mind magic is similar to that in canon with a few changes. Legilimency views memories (and only episodic ones to boot) at the same rate as real time, so one can't simply view another's entire life in 2 minutes. It also provides a good explanation as to why people don't learn via legilimency. Why bother learning from someone else's tainted (via their emotions, separate way of thinking, etc) memories when you can learn yourself? Occulumency is about clearing your mind and mastering your emotions. Why? Legilimency works by having the caster (wandless, nonverbal legilimency works by casting the spell) use emotions to bring up memories. If Snape wanted to view memories of Harry's childhood, he'd likely bring up feelings of happiness, security, and of home in Harry only to fail because it would bring up nothing. A trained occlumency user would spend the time clearing their mind or focusing on different emotions/memories and if they get a good enough control over their emotions, they force the legilimency user out.

** Dude the fic I'm working on is going to have a lot of mind magic, so I've been thinking SO MUCH about it and developed a whole system for how I want Legilimency and Occlumency to work. I think that's probably a good idea---figuring out the system and distinctions beforehand so you have a framework to work in.

The way I imagine it (if you're interested---this is going to get long) there are two types of Occlumency, but first I distinguish between two types of thoughts. You have your top layer thoughts, which is your stream of consciousness, and then you have your memories.

In terms of Occlumency, the easier, basic option is that by clearing your mind of emotions you're essentially erecting like, a bubble or a clay wall around your brain? That includes around your stream of consciousness.

Of course, if the person is good at Legilimency, or if you're not very good at Occlumency, they'll be able to find cracks in the bubble (I.e., cracks in your emotional composure) and burrow into your brain from there. Memories especially are connected with strong emotion, so the more emotions the Legilimens can access, the easier it is for them to see memories. Also, if you're relaxed, the bubble is more flexible and has more give, and so it's harder to get in.

You could also erect this bubble over specific memories, or just your memories as a whole, leaving your stream of consciousness visible. This is all depending on who is reading your mind and whether or not you're submitting voluntarily.

The second level of Occlumency is the addition of fake/inane content on top of the bubble shield. This is useful in the Snape/Voldemort situation. I don't doubt Voldemort constantly wanted to read his followers' minds, and Snape would have to make it seem like he was voluntarily showing Voldemort His thoughts while hiding his true ones.

This basically involves either creating a fake thought/memory or bringing up an existing boring/unrelated memory, and pasting it on to the Occlumency shield in a way that makes it appear natural to the Legilimens. This of course takes practice, preferably with a person capable of reading your mind.

Once a person is in your brain rummaging through your memories, it's much harder to get them out than it was to keep them out in the first place. You literally have to set up this bubble wall thing right in front of the memories they're trying to get at, and slowly squeeze them out through emotional detachment. Like squeezing toothpaste.

I have a whole thing about how Legilimency works as well. I know some of this isn't canon, but this just works best for my fic.

Now, shameless self promotion here: i included a whole thing about my Legilimency theory in the Author's Note at the end of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13648964/3/Lacuna][this chapter of]] my own fic. Obviously I'd love it if you could read the fic (again, shameless, sorry) but either way you might find my Legilimency schpeel interesting.

** There was a thread on this about a week ago: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/hxuv8v/whats_the_most_interesting_interpretation_of/]] .

*My headcanon* (copied from that thread):

More generally, I think that the best interpretations of Occlumency are the ones that treat it as a /dynamic/ process rather than a /static/ defence: not a suit of armour but a parrying dagger. The following is a repost with edits of something I had written up a while ago.

My model for Legilimency is basically an interrogation with an element of torture. However, it's conducted not with words and physical actions but with qualia (thoughts, feelings, mental images, etc.). Occlumency is then training in resisting this type of interrogation and torture.

The Legilimens spell, cast with a wand, creates a magical channel between the caster and the target, one that's mostly, though not completely, under the control of the caster. Through this channel, the Legilimens can inject qualia into the target's mind and read the reaction qualia. That's only the beginning, however, because the Legilimens then needs to correctly interpret what they are reading and follow-up with whatever is needed. Most people have enough trouble consciously considering what's going on in their own heads, and interpreting what's going on in other people's heads, and influencing it with any level of accuracy and predictability, requires prodigious levels of general intelligence and working memory, not to mention a lot of practice.

Occlumency is the skill of identifying, dissociating from, and ignoring the injected qualia (i.e., closing one's mind) so that the Legilimens gets nothing. More advanced Occlumency involves forging responses, perhaps through a form of controlled schizophrenia or dissociative identity disorder. (This can be dangerous, to the point of the Occlumens forgetting which of their thoughts are real and which are forgeries. To quote /A Scarlet Letter/, "No man, for any considerable period, can wear one face to himself and another to the multitude, without finally getting bewildered as to which may be the true.")

A hostile Legilimens trying to break through---assuming that they don't care about being noticed and the target doesn't have a way of breaking the connection---will be looking to find qualia that the Occlumens can't dissociate from or ignore. Once the Legilimens finds one that elicits an uncontrolled response (as far as the Legilimens can tell), they can push on that, keeping the Occlumens off-balance and sending qualia that get the wanted information and other results. The difficulty of learning Occlumency then stems from the fact that the qualia that can be injected are limited only by the imagination, the experience, and the personal squeamishness of the Legilimens. (It's worth keeping in mind that the Legilimens has to, in some sense, experience everything they are sending, and so, say, sending the notion of extreme pain hurts both sides about equally.)

Now, that means that unlike the Levitation Charm or riding a bike, Occlumency is not discrete skill that one learns and moves on. Rather, it is something that one /becomes/. To successfully resist an all-out attack by a skilled Legilimens, one must /be/ the sort of person who can, say, experience seeing, touching, and smelling a mutilated corpse of one's own best friend, sibling, or child (or worse) and shrug.

That, in turn, means that Occlumency training is inherently a painful and dangerous process. The instructor must necessarily expose the student to painful, disgusting, and disturbing qualia, because any attack that the student hasn't already experienced and learned to shrug off is one that may surprise them in the future. In other words, if it doesn't hurt, you're doing it wrong, and it may well be the case that the best Occlumency instructor is a sadist or a psychopath who is on your side. Becoming an Occlumens is therefore inherently traumatic and can cause personality changes, often for the worse.

One aspect of Legilimency that favours defence is that Legilimency requires a functioning mind to interrogate, and drugs, sleep deprivation, and other things that might reduce an Occlumens's ability to resist will also tend to reduce the usefulness and the accuracy of the reading. (For a simple example, physically torturing an Occlumens would make it harder for them to maintain the presence of mind needed for Occlumency, but if all the Legilimens can get in response is "Ow, it hurts!", it's not a very useful thing to do.)

Lastly, eye contact creates a weaker, noisier channel, one which only someone who is highly skilled in both Legilimency and Occlumency could read and interpret: Occlumency is necessary to distinguish the weak "signal" of the incoming foreign thoughts from the "noise" of one's own mind, while skill in Legilimency is needed to make sense of the very noisy "signal". That would be the "wandless" version of Legilimency, which isn't a discrete spell at all, as much as it is the ability to receive and interpret stray foreign thoughts. A mind artist of sufficient skill (e.g., Voldemort) might be able to sense and "denoise" thoughts and feelings even without eye contact.

The Memory Charm interacts with Occlumency in an interesting way. I imagine that it has two targeting modes: recent memories (e.g., "last 10 minutes") and specific memories. The first one is pretty easy, and it's what's used most of the time, though perhaps beyond half an hour or so, memories become increasingly integrated, and trying to target anything older than that risks hitting unrelated memories. The second targeting mode requires the target memory to be brought up using Legilimency. This makes it very difficult to Obliviate a skilled Occlumens without them noticing.

These mechanics have broader consequences, which I think are pretty consistent with HP canon. Since Legilimency is *hard*, there are usually much easier ways to extract information. Therefore, even people who could make use of it don't bother to learn it. This rarity of good Legilimences means that even people with secrets to keep are fine without Occlumency; and this, combined with the price of learning it means that few people learn Occlumency as well, even if they have the opportunity to.

*What Occlumency feels like to the Legilimens* (if the Occlumency is successful):

/Basic Occlumency:/ The Legilimens gets nothing. No matter what they probe, they just get placidity, neutrality, emptiness back. They might try to push some painful, scary, or disturbing qualia until they get some reaction, and then work from there. Still nothing.

/Mid-level Occlumency:/ The Legilimens is happily interrogating away, sending the stimuli to (they think) guide the Occlumens to the information they want, and getting back responses that they would expect, then once they have what they need, they terminate the spell and act on the information, discovering too late that they'd been terribly deceived about that last bit of information.

/Advanced Occlumency:/ The Legilimens is happily interrogating away, but hits a roadblock, and gets an idea to make the Occlumens think that they are no longer being interrogated so that they would let their guard down. They project a perception of them ending the spell in frustration and turning away. They then project the perception of the Occlumens slipping their bonds and somehow overcoming the Full Body Bind they are under. Then the perception of the Occlumens "ambushing" them, knocking them out and stealing their wand (in some order)...

When the Legilimens later wakes up (if they wake up) they will probably be able to reconstruct (if they hadn't been Obliviated) that the idea of making the target thinking that they had escaped had probably been injected by the Occlumens in the first place. Then as they were busy confabulating the perception they were sending to the Occlumens about the Occlumens escaping, the Occlumens had somehow disrupted the mental separation between the Legilimens's imagination and their actions, and they never realised that they were actually untying the Legilimens, ending the Full Body Bind, handing them their wand, and turning their back.

** People tend to bring up "logic" here. Mindscapes dont make sense as occlumency is supposed to "occlude" or hide information. Having a defensible mindscape makes it a battle of wills, where the legimencer has to get through the defenses and find the memories.

What would make sense is learning to show false memories, or think of something random and not being influenced by the legimencer. Thereby "hiding" the important memories.

(Would Voldemort ever alow Snape to keep up mindshield/defenses when he wants to read his mind?)

This however doesn't make mindmagic interesting in itself, -and as seen in canon from Snape it does not supress emotions.

But mindscapes can be interresting to explore, cool defenses, interresting memory sorting etc.

(You can ofc do both, false memories outside the "shield") But in the end it depends on what YOU want occlumency to do.

Should your Mc hide he knows occlumency and hide important memories? Or should he block all access to his mind?

** So as a reader I'm actually a big fan of mind magic, I think it's awesome and I love the idea of mastering your own mind with occulomency. I always imagined it a little like pinball. The legimmens has only minimal control over what they see and are affected by the obstacles. The better a legimmens is, the more control they have. Think stream of consciousness, a legimmens suggests the thought of my sister and that has associations and off we go. Meanwhile, being an occulumens allows you to set up the "obstacles". The first step would be to clear the board of the natural associations you have so that a legimmens doesn't have those associations to follow, they kinda just get stuck. But true masters (like Snape would need to be to fool Voldemort) are able to set up fake associations to display false or misleading memories. Like associating Harry with hate and scorn and Dumbledore with foolishness and disgust. I think keeping those associations together would actually likely have some harm on the psyche. It would be an interesting topic to explore.

That's how I would write it if I did any writing, but as a reader I'll admit that I've always enjoy the mindscape depictions.

** I think it depends on how magic works in your fanfic.

If magic flows on the inside of people's bodies whenever this is by a magical core, wizards somehow absorb it or it seeps from the soul of some such will drastically change on how it would go.

For example if your magic is from magical cores and it flows into the body, then you can do crazy shit with occlumency.

Just say, occlumency is the art on which you pour magic into your mind to create legimency shields. BUT now you have a brain with a fuckload of magic running though it, what happens when that occurs? Do they get smarter? Can they recall their memories better? How does the actual grey matter react to this?

Or if your magic is less powerfull and it's never on the wizards body and they are just manipulating the magic around them, then maybe occlumency is just a way of thinking and a trained method you can use to detect if anyone is digging in your mind and how to counter such by thinking in specific ways. Perhaps even muggles can learn occlumency then?
