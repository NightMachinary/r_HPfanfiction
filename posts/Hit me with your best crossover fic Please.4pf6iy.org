** Linkffn(The Havoc side of the force), linkffn(11157943)

Those two are great star wars crossover fics and funny too. Next up I have a couple of LOTR crossover fics as well

linkffn(The Shadow of Agmar) is an out of the ordinary fic and enjoyable at first but it does get rather dull after a while

Linkffn(onto greener pastures and brighter skies)

Linkffn(11027086) is decent if I remember correctly

The best one I wanted to link you to tho I can't find yet but will link when I can. Its HP/LOTR, wierd, funny, and plain amazing.

Edit: If anyone can link the fic with Neville and Molly being contacted by the valar to replace Gandalf I'd be much obliged. I can't seem to find it and am now half convinced I might have dreamed it. I haven't been on enough drugs to think something like that up so I can't have dreamed it

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  A decade ago Harry Potter found himself in a beautiful and pristine land. After giving up hope of finding his friends he settled upon the wide plains below the mountains. Peaceful years pass before a Ranger brings an army to his door and he feels compelled once again to fight. Perhaps there is more to be found here than solitude alone. Harry/Ã‰owyn.

  Harry Potter has done it: he has defeated the Dark Lord. Yet this victory has come at a great price: namely, the eradication of the entire human race. Wizards, muggles, and creatures alike perished and now Harry is alone left, cursed with the title of the Master of Death and an extended life. So, Harry does what any wizard with too much time would: he goes "traveling".

- linkffn(Even if You Miss (You'll Land Among the Stars) by eternalchange) xavengers, incomplete.

- linkffn(Fork It Over by Barrel of Monkeys) xTwilight, in-progress
- linkffn(Find Me a White Knight Cloaked in Black by cywscross) xNaruto, incomplete, This author has plenty more very good crossovers
- linkffn(The Professor's Journey by AlphaEph19) xNaruto, incomplete, not Harry-centric but you don't really need knowledge of Naruto to read this.
- linkffn(Only a Boy by Riddell Lee) xMerlin, in-progress, Merlin-centric
- linkffn(A Study in Magic by Books of Change) xBBC Sherlock, complete

*(Mostly Crack) Oneshots:*

- linkffn(First Impressions by Kissy Fishy) xMerlin, crack.

** These are some of my favorite. I like the twice blessed challenge, but really I just like a demigod Harry. These are a fem Harry, so take that as you will. The author is quite good and I liked them. They are only the first part though. There are second parts being written.

This is a good one as well. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11024296/1/Godling-Ascending]])

I was really into linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11715537/1/Pandemonium]]) and it's predecessor, but I have to agree with the author it is kinda cringe worthy at times.

I'm not sure what else to put. I know I have read read some others, but for the life of me they are escaping my mind.

** I don't know too many crossovers, but I loved 'The Lamentable Comedy of Severus, Half-Blood Prince of Denmark' - basically Snape gets sent to 16th century Denmark and ends up struggling to save the characters of Hamlet from themselves. It sounds weird, but it's AWESOME. linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2725514/chapters/6105773]])

There's also my fic, in which BBC Sherlock attends Hogwarts and starts writing in Tom Riddle's diary. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11977774/1/The-Correspondent]])
