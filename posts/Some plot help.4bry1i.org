I'm currently writing a story and have hit a brick wall in the plot. Forgive any errors in spelling im dyslexic and my spellchecker has decided to die on me.

Here's what has happened so far:

End of 1st year at Dudley's school, dudley is called in for an anger management session. During the session Dudley unlocks his magic.

Skip to the dinner party, Dudley see the cake floating towards Mrs Mason and uses accidental magic to throw the cake and Harry out of sight. The night is a success, Vernon gets a promotion, Harry doesn't get bars on his windows, Dudley gets his letter. However due to an unsuccessful meeting with a Hogwarts teacher Petunia and Vernon refuse Dudley's acceptance to Hogwarts as well as Harrys. Naturally Ron and the twins come to help and Dudley hitches a ride on the Weasleys Ford.

At the Weasleys Dudley threatens his parents that he'll never return unless they allow him to got to Hogwarts, which they reluctantly agree to. Dudley falls for Ginny. Ginny is disgusted by him and his treatment of Harry.

At Hogwarts Dudley half heartedly follows Ginny, que Ginnymort. Dudley follows Ginnymort to the room of requirement, but can't get in relenting his stupidity and wishing he was smarter. The room opens leading to Reavenclaws relic. Dudley puts it on. As the dark curse and Voldemorts soul fragment attacks him, the crown imbues Dudley with knowledge of how to over come them both by devouring the Voldemorts soul, temporarily neutralising the curse giving Dudley time to excape. Dudley now has a part of Voldemorts soul and super intelligence for the crown.

This however is its own curse and the intelligence is draining away fast, and Dudley is in a race against time to remove the deadly curse from the crown before he's to stupid to do so.

My brick wall. what happens next?

I want to deviate from cannon I have to have the chamber opening because Ginnymort is need to get big D to the Crown. I also want to have Harry and Dudley clash as much as possible.

I'm hoping for some spit balling/inspiration. Thanks guys and gals.


** Hm... There can only be one, have Ginnymort and Dudleymort clash. I can't see Voldemort willing to share power, even with himself.

I see two options, either Dudley getting petrified- and Dumbledore discovering the diadem on his person or not, but at least relieving the curse upon him, or the two clashing at the end of the year in the Chamber of secrets, fighting for control of the snake and against each other, and Harry showing up like in cannon, setting the two as temporary allies. The results of the fight could go any way, but I'd say have Dudley retrain Voldemort's power or some of his knowledge and survive, and have Harry far worse off at the end than in canon, hospitalized perhaps.

*** That's pretty interesting. I'm not sure how much influence Dudley devouring Voldemorts soul should have on him. Plarseltongue I think is a given. I keep switching between Dudley being able to talk to that part of him that is Voldemort, but I think that gives volde to much power, and volde being completely absorbed with flashes of memory as hints to the dangers ahead.

**** Hm... Well, if you don't want Voldemort to have control in the end over Dudley, once second year is resolved, have him keep the ambition as well.

Dudley was a mostly unmotivated boy for most of the series, he turned his life around a tiny bit in learning boxing, but every step of the way in his diet he seemed to balk. He came across as a lazy bully. with a hefty dose of ambition, he can become a much more credible threat to Harry.

Edit: You don't even need to let Dudley keep memories or part of Voldemort's soul for this, let him come to the realization the Voldemort started small and untrained- albeit with natural talent, but that power, true power, is obtainable with hard work.

** it sounds like a fun fic, I'd read it. The Herimone/Dudley interaction would be pretty funny when he's suddenly super smart after what I would assume was a lacklustre start.. Harry would be deeply sceptical of a brilliant Dudley. So the trio would be trailing him to suss out the how and running interference for Ginnymort.. good place for a comedy of errors..

Draco/Dudley interactions would be interesting..

sorry, plotting is my downfall hope that ramble helps a bit.

*** Hermione would either berate Harry for being so critical of Dudder's new found intelligence or believe he's cheating like she does Harry in HPB and become even more insufferable.

** I'm thinking Dudley's immediate steps would be going to the library. Maybe he stumbles upon a studious Hermione and he enlists her help (without saying much) to remove the curse. And Hermione in turn brings it to the skeptical Harry and Ron who refuse to help. So Hermione gets annoyed and helps Dudley on her own.

Attacks start happening, the trio overhear that the attacks have happened before, 50 years ago, Hermione lets that slip to Dudley. Meanwhile Dudley has been researching everything he can about Voldy and realizes that the timeline matches up. Since he will know about Tom Riddle he can at some point near the end spot the diary and see it for what it is.

I think the ultimate goal needs to be both Dudley and Harry going down in the chamber to save Ginny that way Dudley can have a basilisk fang destroy the horcrux. Dudley will be able tow in Harry's trust when he can prove who Riddle is and how he has been possessing Ginny.

That's broad stroke ideas (not sure if you were asking immediately what's next or how to finish the story but from your start that's where I imagine it going! Very interesting concept I hope you post it here soon :)

** While Dudley's trying to secure his intelligence, he's also holding up a charade with Ginnymort to make her think he's still controlled by the diadem horcrux -- and at the same time avoiding suspicion from everyone who's used to Dudley "I aspire to one day match wits with Greg Goyle" Dursley. Assuming he's at it for more than a little while. If it's the work of an afternoon, there's not enough time for there to be much worthwhile conflict there.

You probably want a side conflict running through at the same time. It gives you interesting situations to explore that tension. Academics, sports, and anti-Muggleborn sentiment are obvious options. For academics, Dudley's the sort of person to struggle to pay attention, but with the Diadem, he can do much better. But he has to avoid making too dramatic a change, so that's a bit dicey and you can play with that. For anti-Muggleborn sentiment, I'd like to see how Draco reacts to him. He's Muggleborn and closely linked to the loathed Harry Potter. But he also beats on Harry, which Draco should approve of.

You also have to decide: how much success do you want Dudley to have? Will he fix the Diadem and gain full access to its power? Will he fix his intelligence in place at some point? How much smarter will he get?

If he ends up being no smarter than he was, that would be rather tragic. But he can come up with policies while still intelligent that he can follow later that will improve his life. And that's an interesting possibility. If he ends up repairing the Diadem so it's safe to use, at least for him, he will have a large advantage, though it's tempered by a lack of experience and training. And his natural laziness.
