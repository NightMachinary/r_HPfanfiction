Like the title says I'm looking for fics that are:

- MOD Harry Potter
- time travel involved
- not a HP/TMR pairing
- order bashing/Dumbledore bashing is a plus but not required.

  Harry died - again - and woke up in King's Cross - again. This time, he was alone when a train came for him. But his next great adventure wasn't onward, it was backward, and Harry found a new destiny and a world to save - one child at a time.

** linkffn(Original WTT by Sapper One) is the original version and linkffn(Whiskey Time Travel by Sapper) is the WIP rewrite.

Unspeakable Operative Harry Potter wakes up in 1977 or so and goes from there. Very powerful but IIRC ge never directly said he was the MOD. He did state he's come back from death before.

I should also mention linkffn(Put your Galleons where your mouth is) but since that's like the most famous MOD Time Travel story, I'm sure you've already read it.

#+begin_quote
  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1978, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1978

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

** Well, there's the Faery Heroes story, though even if he ends up getting all of them, he doesn't become MOD. It ticks all the other boxes, though. Maybe that one too if by MOD you mean an OP Harry.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny
