I forced through one recently where Bellatrix leads Pansy,Millicent and Daphne in raping the male members of Dumbledore 's Army . They fucking anally rape Ernie with his own fucking wand and then shove the wand down Dean's throat among other other highlights .


** Really, just browse Ao3 long enough and you'll find something worse than that. And then you'll find something even worse. And /then/ if you still haven't started to at least /skim/ the tags you'll get something that will make you want to toss your laptop out the window.

People can be terrifying and disgusting, and it's all the worse when it's well-written.

Now, to answer your question, I'm going to have to mention Abyss---though it's already been nominated---for reasons that I surely don't have to explain. Other than that (and the short shreds of torture-porn that float about in the murky waters of Ao3) I'd have to say the last bit of The Downward Spiral Series, simply because I spent so much time readying them; I thought I knew what I was getting into. But I have a weak stomach, it seems, compared to your example.

Outside of sexual stuff, however, there was a fic I read a while back that dealt with some serious body-horror. I remember it as having been written very well, and I think that's what really made my insides tie themselves up in knots. I don't know---it might not have been all that bad, looking back on it, but it was late. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3911615/1/Forgive-Those-Who-Trespass]]

**** Okay, so I just reread the first two chapters of "Forgive Those Who Trespass", and I think I remember enough of it to give a half-decent summary.

​

[Spoilers]:

Harry and everyone else are all grown up and working/training in various areas of the Ministry, when Ron and Hermione decide to transfer to the Department of Mysteries. However, something happens soon after, and everyone in the DoM goes missing without any warning or explanation. In an effort to find answers---and his friends---Harry gets a bit reckless and decides to jump down into and explore DoM, which has been cut-off from the rest of the Ministry.

Very quickly, he finds Draco Malfoy, who hasn't been seen in the country for a whole year and seems to have been...severely abused, to say the /absolute/ least, during that duration of time. Draco knows what's been happening down in the DoM, but he can't say anything in detail. Anything at all, actually---Draco has been turned mute, along other things. Together, the two of them decide to continue deeper to the center of the Department of Mysteries in an attempt to escape, all the while facing horrors that threaten their very lives and sanity.

If you're squeamish about corpses, mutilated corpses, body horror, gore, profanity, corpses being re-purposed into various items, etc. then this fic is not for you. It is complete, and roughly 140k words long.

​

I'm not going to go into any more detail, asides from giving you the heads-up that it /is/ Drarry Pre-Slash, but that's advertised on the first page regardless. Again, I don't remember that much, but hopefully this is enough for you to decide if you wish to read it or no.

****** See, at this point I've mostly just started to skip over whatever romantic parts there are in fics; it's all usually poorly done and wayy too cheesy for my tastes, especially considering I really just want to read stuff that has decent characterisations and preferably a lot of amazing, dangerous, magical creatures.

Now, back to the main subject...

​

[Spoilers for Abyss---NSWF]

I wouldn't read Abyss unless you want to scratch your eyes out. And even then, it's slash as well, so not something I think you'd like, it seems. It's sort of a revenge fic---Harry was more or less taken in as a sex slave for Voldemort for several years until Harry manages to travel back in time to when Tom Riddle was still a little kid. Like, 6 or 7 or something like that. He was going to kill him, but decided grooming him would be a better option. Things go downhill from there.

So yeah---the main characters in that fic are rubbish. You feel some sympathy for Tom...that is, whenever you're not asking yourself why you haven't closed the tab yet. I did end up closing it, just not until much later than I should have.

​

And for the Downward Spiral Series...

Short Answer: The Downward Spiral is a must-read if you're /really/ into this sort of dark!Harry thing, or if you're too curious for your own good. I fell in with the second category.

​

Long Answer [Spoilers for The Downward Spiral series---NSWF]:

The Downward Spiral was....well...I knew going into it that it wasn't going to be pretty, but I thought I could handle it. I couldn't. The first two, maybe three books aren't very great. I attempted to read it several times and kept closing the tab. But it just kept coming up in thread after thread /after thread/ and I /had/ to know what was going on. I suppose I'm contributing to this whole cycle as well, now.

Also, it's been a bit so forgive me if some of the details are off.

It starts off with a pretentious, I-am-better-than-thou Harry who was placed in an orphanage---I can't remember if by the Dursleys or by Dumbledore, but that doesn't matter, I don't think... He's sorted into Slytherin, makes shady connections, blah, blah, the /usual/ dark!Harry fic sorta thing where over time Harry gets more and more interested in the Dark Arts and joining Voldemort and what-not.

The last half of the series steps it up a notch. At some point he and Daphne Greengrass get together, and she's just as into the Dark Arts as he is. Together, they're this sort of power couple who keep engaging in this sort of insane, cruel behaviour. They start off with gratuitous torture, murder and gore and it only spirals as they add more and more fuel to each other's fire. It gets to the point where they kidnap a Slytherin girl and rape, torture (and maybe kill? I forget) her while they fuck. I think that was either in the end of the fifth book or the beginning of the sixth; I quit right after that.

Oh, and did I mention the side-story where Bellatrix maims, tortures and brainwashes Tonks into renouncing her name and killing a close loved-one? I think it's almost standalone, actually, if you want to give /that/ a whirl sometime.

​

So...yeah. Maybe these stories are more up your alley. Maybe they aren't, but you're curious all the same. /Whatever/. But I encourage anyone thinking about reading these to take a step back and think---really /think/---to yourself: "Do I really want to read something that sounds /half/ as bad as this? Do I /really?"/

I encourage going and reading a bunch of dragon-themed fluff stories or something instead of these. I really do. But regardless of your decision, I wish you the best of luck.

******* Yeah I'm thinking none of these are really my speed. I was looking for something scary, dark, and realistic without being pointlessly gratuitous with violence, gore, or weird sex stuff.

“See, at this point I've mostly just started to skip over whatever romantic parts there are in fics; it's all usually poorly done and wayy too cheesy for my tastes, especially considering I really just want to read stuff that has decent characterisations and preferably a lot of amazing, dangerous, magical creatures.”

If there are any like this that you think are good enough to skip stuff, I'm happy to branch out.

‘And can someone, please, for the love this thread and all others, tell me how I can keep my responses /short---/oh my god'

Hahaha nice try! But thanks for this, was really interesting reading about these without actually having to read these. Which sounds like a win really.

1.Harry Potter:The Lover or something like that.Long story short,the description said Voldemort bought Harry as a sex slave and whored him out to all the usual characters(Fleur,Draco,Snape,Daphne,etc.)There were like 20-30 pairings with Harry

2.A 5 maybe 6 way between several male characters.All I remember is the “train sex” tag.Don't think I read the summary

I was /so/ happy when they introduced the "exclude" option, but there is, unfortunately, plenty of NSFW stuff that slips through those filters.

** Far more than any kind of rape-for-titillation and violence-for-shock-value fics, I am disturbed by rape-is-love tropes and abuse justification. I've read multiple fics seriously claiming that the Dursleys weren't abusive, just a bit neglectful, and it was for the best anyway so that Harry didn't grow up arrogant and spoilt (and it was obvious that it's not just a character's opinion but the author's as well), and they disturb me far more than a graphic description of carving an eye out with a spoon, because they show an actual harmful belief that the author probably holds in real life.

**** Well, this was Dumbledore's justification for leaving Harry in the muggle world, but I doubt he expected or wanted Harry to be abused in any way. And most people who subscribe to manipulative!evil!Dumbledore theory and say that he totally knew and approved of what was happening agree that such actions would be, well, manipulative and evil (or at least morally questionable). Harry's upbringing contributed to who he is as a person, of course, but I don't think it's ever framed as justified.

Dumbledore called him into his office and Tom put Amortentia in his drink and had Dumbledore pretty much screw him in his own office... Harry witnessed this from beginning to end in a penseive.

It's a twisted way of saying why Dumbledore never actively went after Voldemort. He could easily claim rape even though it was the other way around.

** There's this fanfic I stumbled across once where Harry finds out that Ginny has been drugging him with love potions since he was sixteen years old. He realizes this when he's a fully fledged adult with his three kids with her. I know this one isn't as disturbing as some, but it's still Harry basically being raped for around nineteen years. It basically also ignores that the entire reason Voldemort was the way he was is because his mother raped his father. He was incapable of love because of how he was conceived.

I also once stumbled upon a fic where Draco was being sexually abused by his father. There was another where Bellatrix sexually abused him.

YEARS ago, back when I first got into fanfic, I stumbled upon a fic where Harry raped Hermione before her wedding to Ron. This was when the movies and books were still coming out.

** I've read a few rape fics (FemHarry as a sexual slave to the goblin nation, Umbridge mind controlling the DA into gang-raping Hermione) in the hope of some form of unholy retribution.

Disappointingly, all I got was regular rape in graphic detail and Stockholm syndrome instead of FemHarry purging every single Goblin by flooding their caves with mustard gas or Hermione going full Bellatrix Lestrange and hunting down everyone dear to Umbridge, putting their crucified corpse in the Ministry Atrium one by one.

****** Given that the Goblins actually control the economy and are a nation of warriors, not at all. Besides, the Muggleborn are Rowling's Jew equivalent when it comes to persecution. The Goblins are an unethical bank (they rob graves for profit), not a persecuted people.

Also mustard gas is infamous for its use during the first World War, not the Holocaust. Awkward would be the usage of Cyclone II.

*** SLyfer101's golbin debt challenge wasn't that bad apart from Fem!Harry going back to the Goblins at the end, at least there was the Illusion of consent and Fem!Harry was of Age.(Or mabye I have just read a few to many Doujinshi and have become desensitised)

I find the two answers the challenge worse both of them have it that Fem!Harry was Raped by the Dursley's and Obliviate by Dumbledore about it and then the Goblins break the memory charms.

Hermione Granger and the Bastet Collar and The Head Girl of Gryffindor are both worse.

**** It was utterly out of character for everyone. I mean, you remember SPEW, right? And Hermione is known for being ruthless and violent if need be. So anything other than "Goblin Genocide, the movie" is the wrong response, especially after they all are hardened by the war.

***** I would say that Everyone but Fem!Harry was out of Character, after all Canon harry can be pretty impulsive.(this is mainly about the first chapter were Fem!Harry agrees to a deal without talking to anyone that was utter stupidity)

and I hate that Fem!Harry does back to the Goblin I would have preferred for Hermione or one of the other girls to have a go at being Fem!Harry master(Hermione, Luna and the Girls trying to learn how to be Fem!Harry master while trying to turn it into a Proper Bdsm Relationship would have been interesting).

Still I don't mind the Goblins in that Fic Simply because I hate the Friendly goblin Trope that is so common in HPfanfiction.

** There was one that was disturbing because I actually enjoyed it at times.

It was a cliche Dark!Harry fic but it went to the extreme

I remember Harry brutally torturing and mutilating Hermione to the point of suicide because a ritual required someone to willingly use the killing curse on themselves

Also later on Pettigrew is forced to violently kill his own mother

Yet it had so many interesting and good ideas that I didn't hate it

** Psychopathic Charlie Weasley manipulates Bill into having a relationship with him, traumatises George to the point that he's mute, trains Fred to think he has to have sex with George, gets into a relationship with Barty Crouch Jnr (and later Barty Crouch Jnr's soulless husk post-Kiss)... It's messed up. Told from Bill's PoV and compelling enough that I finished the fic. Somehow.

  Bill realises at a young age something is wrong with Charlie, but for reasons he will never be able to understand, he hides it. He soon learns it's the biggest mistake he'll ever make because in trying to protect Charlie, he's allowed everyone else to suffer and pay the price instead, and it's something that will forever haunt him.

Corvus Fallere by mousewrites is a ‘Voldemort Wins/Golden Trio fic in 2 parts. It's LONG, well-written, superbly disturbing with an amazing ending you'll never see coming. I had to skip over quite a bit of it!

  Harry Potter is not like other boys. He's not even like other wizards. Everyone thinks they know the real Harry, but they're wrong. He has a secret even his friends Ron and Hermione don't know about, a secrets that he fears they would never understand or accept about him. But he may have found someone who understands and accepts him completely; someone who shares his secret. (AU)
