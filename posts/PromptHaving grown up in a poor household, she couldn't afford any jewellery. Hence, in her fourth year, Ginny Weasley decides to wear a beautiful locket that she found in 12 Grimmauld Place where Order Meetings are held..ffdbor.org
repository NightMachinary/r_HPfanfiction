**** I briefly toyed with the thought of Ginny making a horcrux out of gryffindor's sword by killing Tom Riddle in the chamber. So Harry is using Ginny-sword, and tries the resurrection ritual Voldemort did in the 4th book.

It amused me to have Harry just walking around talking to the sword as if it was Ginny and everyone else just thinking he went mad with grief in the chamber. Dumbledore is the only problem with that one.

/edit/ I didn't say this, but this assume she dies. I briefly toyed with Harry stabbing Ginny and the book at the same time to make it.

***** Harry stared at the magic rock he had found in the Room of Requirement, shocked at what Hermione had just old him about its powers.

"I can really use it to remove one person completely from existence?"

Hermione nodded eagerly at that.

"It's amazing that you found such a legendary item Harry!"

Harry smiled at that.

"Yeah, this is exactly what we need to get rid of Umbridge.

"Umbridge?" Hermione looked shocked and appalled at Harry's statement. "No, now you can save Britain from Voldemort!"

Harry's smile fell at that.

"Harry!"

"I'm thinking about it," he muttered, tossing the seemingly ordinary rock back and forth between his hands, before finally gripping it tight.

"Nah. Why would I waste it on Voldemort? This is the kind of artifact the hero uses to defeat /real/ villains."

With that, Harry ran off, determined to put an end to Umbridge's reign of tyranny.

Her mum slowly approached her and told her to take off her bracelet so that they could make sure it is not cursed.

She is sick of this. She is not that bad. So what if she got possessed by a diary or a locket or a tiara. That doesn't mean they have to jump her every single time. For Merlin's sake a butter beer cork bracelet is not going to be cursed.
