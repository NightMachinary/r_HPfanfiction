** World where men have larger "magical cores". Oh wait, because men are rare, women rule the wizarding world. Oh and wizards/witches glow in the dark cause magic. Men have to marry witches to weaken their magic and strengthen witches. If they don't, the women have the man killed/forcibly married/etc. It's not all great for women though, politics are brutal amongst. The story is super weirdly sexualized starting from the first year. One medical procedure involved rape with a dildo

The trilogy follows Harry and his antagonists of the current ruling body of magical Britain and Voldemort. The US plays an important role too because it's split in two and one of the regions is ruled by wizards in a twist that everyone everywhere hates.

** The fic starts as a parody of a dumb harem idea: "what if there were 3 witches for every wizards and harems were normal?" You've all seen dozens of smutty harem-fics with that presence (don't pretend like you haven't clicked on them as a guilty pleasure).

Then it takes that idea and plays it straight:

- Why are there three times as many witches as wizards? What (magical) phenomenon actually causes this? What other side-effects does this have?
- What would such a world actually look like? Both in relationship dynamics and political? Would men have the same amount of power they normally have or is it a woman's world and are wizards second class citizens?

It then throws in the canon characters in this new world and re-imagines their place in it. Voldemort still exists and is every bit of psychopathic and cruel, but as a man in such a world his play for power can no longer be about blood purity but has to center around the power dynamics of the sexes.

â€‹

What you get is a story about the magical world unlike any you've ever seen before. It breaks down how fucked up this concept really is and pulls no punches about certain consequences and what it means for young wizards to live n such a society.

I highly recommend it for seasoned fanfiction-readers due to how unique and interesting it really is. It is however also much darker than what you might be used to and is not suited for everyone who just wants to read a simple fic to have a good time.

** Firebird trilogy features a wizarding world which is matriarchal(women in charge). This is because females are born more often than males.

Females have a smaller magic core but bonding with a wizard allows them to use/steal a small part of the male. Being weaker but more numerous they eventually use this fact to bond especially strong wizards(albus, tom, harry etc) to witches early (as early as third year) so that they can be weakened and managed properly.

The ministry and wizengamot exist and are nominally in charge but truthfully its the covens (their matriarchs) that actually run things behind the scenes.

Another deviation from canon is that wix are biologically different from muggles and hence can only reproduce with them until a certain age, past which it is physically impossible to produce a child. Also wix are eerie in appearance as well which gets worse as they age... Thus statue is enforced much more rigidly.

Voldy is still the antagonist but it isn't the only one and the story is fairly interesting overall with a good premise. The only criticism comes from the overly sexual nature of this wizarding world and the children being underage which can get squicky. If you can somehow get past that issue the trilogy is definitely a worth a read given the unique nature of the world.

YNWA!
