I have finished all of the Lone Traveler stories by Dunuelos, and was wondering if anybody knew of stories like them. For those who haven't read them, the main character is a kingmaker of sorts.

  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon). Year One Complete. Sequel will come - eventually.
