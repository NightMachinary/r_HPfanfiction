Exactly what the title says. It doesn't need to be a focus point or anything, but I'm tired of bashing and would like some nice Dumbledore. I prefer a romantic fic, but it is not necessary. If it is romantic, any pairing is fine, but I would prefer no slash.

Thanks in advance!

** I AM NOT CRAZY! I am not crazy...I know he put his name in the Goblet of Fire! I know he bypassed the aging spell I cast on it. As if I could ever make such a mistake. Never! NEVER! I just couldn't prove it! And he covered his tracks, he got that idiot Ronald Weasley to lie for him! You think this is something? You think this is bad? This? This pottery? He's done worse! That Quidditch match! Are you telling me a man just happens to fall like that? No! He orchestrated it! Harry! HE CRASHED A CAR INTO THE WHOMPING WILLOW! And I saved him! I shouldn't have...took him into my own school! What was I thinking? He'll never change. He'll NEVER change! Ever since he was 11. Always the same! COULDN'T KEEP HIMSELF OUT OF THE THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR!

*** Maybe not evil, but incompetent and negligent, which is still pretty bad.

In order not to make Dumbledore such a dick and yet still have a resemblance of canon events, authors of 'good' Dumbledore must change some things like:

- No abusive Dursleys
- Significantly more malicious and uncooperative Ministry
- As a consequence of the above point, Dumbledore's apparent 'inactions' during that ten years could be partly explained
- During Year 2, a different response and resolution than in canon is needed
- During Year 4, Barty Jr impersonated his own father instead of Moody

***** My standard for "good" seems a lot higher than yours. Lol.

Not being malicious is not "good" for me.

Canon Dumbledore is incompetent and negligent as hell. You could attribute his actions in earlier books as typical children's series shenanigans, but what he did in HBP was utterly unacceptable. Let a wizard Nazi terrorist carrying out acts of murder and sabotage in your school, just for the faint hope of turning him? Honestly, go fuck yourself!

****** Don't forget sending a child who was fearing for his life all year home after being an integral part in a dark ritual, seeing a schoolmate murdered, then forced to duel with a terrorist and nearly dying home to an at best (I'm ignoring fanon) negligent family and /telling no one to talk to him/ so he can't talk to anyone about it. We won't get into doing almost the exact same thing after book five. He's lucky Harry didn't snap after that.

Funny thing is I like good Dumbledore fics. But they do require changes to canon to make it believable. A lot of what's in the books is written in a Doylist fashion because Rowling needed it written.

One of my fav Good Dumbles fics is in Harry is a Dragon and that's Okay, because they don't just copy canon.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** The funny thing is, one of the good Dumbledores I've seen has come from a fic that's from Voldemort's perspective, where he tries to kill and defame old Dumbles at every opportunity. ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12980210/1/I-Am-Lord-Voldemort][link]])

Another story with a genuinely good Dumbledore is one where Harry mysteriously turns into a dragon at a young age. It's a lighthearted story with excellent character interactions. ([[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-is-a-dragon-and-thats-okay-hp-au-crack.731548/#post-55525642][link]])

Lastly, we've got the Dumbledore of HPMOR. He's good, and (spoilers) most of his weird and nonsensical actions are explained as a result of him piecing together and following every prophecy he can get his hands on in order to save the world. The Harry of this story is a little shit though, and immediately distrusts the one adult character who is fully behind him and has his best interests at heart. If this one interests you, start at chapter five. You're not missing anything important. ([[http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/5][link]])

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.
