Following the Battle of Hogwarts and the defeat of Voldemort, Harry feels the need to get out of Britain and away from the relentless spotlight of being the Man-Who-Conquered. Where does he go, and what does he see? What dangers might spring up along the way?


** My thoughts are something along the lines of linkffn(Make A Wish), but with an adult(ish... Of age, at any rate) Harry, in the aftermath of the war.

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.

** I haven't seen to many stories of Harry just taking a vacation around the world. Best thing I found is linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8554615]]) not quite around the world but a more adult Harry taking a well deserved vacation

  Harry won the war! So, why is he sitting all alone at Grimmauld Place while everyone else is off celebrating, or planning his life? Well, maybe it's time our hero took a little vacation and enjoyed the lost summer.
