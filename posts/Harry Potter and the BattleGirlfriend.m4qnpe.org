I read linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived) recently, and one aspect I liked was the relationship between Harry and Calypso. Among other things, they're competitive. They train against each other to absurd degrees, leaving them each injured, in a way that really only makes any kind of sense in a universe like Harry Potter (where healing magic is commonplace and people seem generally much more study). I remember some similar aspects to the relationship between Harry and Hermione in linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School), and I wonder if there are any other good fics that use this trope?

Slash is fine too, as long as it's well-done. I'm not really looking for a pure romance fic, though, so much as one where the "power couple" that drive each other to improve in ways that seem extreme to the rest of the characters are central to the story (though feel free to mention them anyway if you think they're particularly good). It doesn't really need to be Harry Potter x someone else, either - I feel like you could do a Dumbledore / Grindlewald fic where this is a part of what makes their relationship so unique. Who else could they really let loose against, learn from, and trust to not take advantage of them while they're down?

Also acceptable in a similar vein are fics like Blindness, where they're sort of a "mad scientist" power couple, but it's a weaker fit on the "too extreme for the rest of the world" aspect. In Blindness, for the most part (earlier on) they can't share their experiments with the rest of the world because of Harry's special ability, not because of something between the two of them. Then later, as the experiments become darker, it feels less like a collaboration. I'm a sucker for magical science, though, and would still appreciate particularly good recs along these lines.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
