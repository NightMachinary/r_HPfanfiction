Hey guys, im searchin for some fics with Harry paired with Voldemort's daughter.\\
She can be Delphini, she can be OC, does't matter to me.\\
Idc about her personality also, she can be nice, cruel, evil, depressed, sarcastic, anything is fine.\\
No fem Harry.\\
I also don't like Dumbledore and Sirius bashing (Any other characters im fine) but if you think the fic that you have is worth of reading you can send me, with or without bashing.\\
Idc about Harry's personality also, just one thing about him, most of the fics with this pairing that i've read, the female mc was nearly god-like and did everything alone, Harry was just the useless male side character.\\
So i want something well written, with a great focus on the TWO of them. (Don't care if the two of them are extremly OP)

NO Harem or Multi.

I've already readed the fic Daughter of darkness and was the best with this pairing the OC was great and she and Harry had a great chemistry.\\
I would like something somewhat long, so that i can distract myself for quite some time, but if you don't have anything that long i'm okay with one shots, shortfics or just new ones, as long as it's well written.


** So I narrowed it down to 1 out of a possible 235 fics after weeding out the most recent ones from the past few years... it's been awhile since I read this one. And then I was randomly opening fics and searching for one word. Yeah, it's gotta a pretty memorable scene in it.

The original link was a mugglenet link... which apparently no longer has fan fiction?! So if this one doesn't work, PM me and I'll figure something out.

Enjoy!
