** There was the one where Harry goes back in time with the help of Lily's ghost where he's treated like a son by the Dursley's, Sirius doesn't go to Azkaban, and Luna's mom lives. Harry teams up with Quirrelmort by giving him some of Voldemort's horcruxes and reabsorbing them so he's mentally stable.

  Harry was left at an orphanage after his parents met their demise. There, he finds nothing but suffering until he rejoins the Wizarding World. Dumbledore may hope for Harry to be a kind soul, but he's made mistakes. And what he gets is a future Death Eater. Harry is Dark, Harry is ruthless, and he is siding with Voldemort.

  Harry doesn't want to learn magic or go to Hogwarts -- he just wants to be normal, like the Dursleys. But a meddling, crazy old wizard won't take "no" for an answer. Harry might have to learn how to be a normal wizard instead - but will he learn from Light wizards or pure-blood friends? Smart!Harry, Manipulative!Dumbledore. Complete. Part 2 of "Perfectly Normal".
