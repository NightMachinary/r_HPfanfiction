:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The fanfic involved something really mysterious about the lupin family if I remember correctly. The Lupins were apparently some really secretive and powerful family that everyone was afraid of. This was not the main plot, it was just build up before Remus was revealed. I hadn't been reading fanfics for some time now and forget it's name. If you could help me out, I would be really thankful.
