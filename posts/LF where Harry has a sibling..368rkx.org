I've read [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=17021&page=3][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by Santi]] for the fourth time now. I love how Harry and Nathan's(the younger twin-who-lived) relationship is potrayed, everything that I search that has similar tropes to this has Harry ignored and abandoned by his parents/Dumbles which I can't really agree with. So is there any fic where Harry is a brother and potrayed realistically(a.k.a not Unsung Hero trope). Thanks


** Here's [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=1382&textsize=0&chapter=1][something]] a bit different.

Heh.

*** I read half of it, but then stopped when it started to feel like a perverted American Sitcom, where the protagonist can't help himself from f*cking up all the time.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

I love this one, it's great how he gradually becomes unhinged.

The other-dimension Harry has siblings. Their interaction with canon Harry is good.

*** Read halfway in Too Young to Die and gave up because it IMO just became ridiculous and fucked up. It also falls heavily on Lily and James being unrealistically arses

Family bonds seems pretty good and close to Boy Who Lived. Looks really interesting.

  The watchful eyes of the adoring public are locked on to the girl-who-lived-to-be-frustrated-by-society rather than where they ought to be: on her scheming twin brother. Slytherin!Harry, no Potter favoritism, no particular romance

** I can't think of its name - but there was one where Hermione turned out to be the daughter of Snape and Lily that had been put up for adoption in the past (So she was "older" even though she was born second).
