Harry (and possibly Hermione) die during the Battle and/or the Redheads suffer from PTSD and find comfort in each other, resulting in comfort sex/relationship.

Alternatively: Ginny is no member of the "Main Weasleys", but comes from a different Family line (cousin/sister of 3rd, 4th and so on grade) and meets with the Arthur&Molly clan at some family event or as some sort of exchange student and Ron gets a Crush on her. Maybe there is a little "Crush" reaction between Ginny and Harry (although it might for Harry just her resemblance to his Mother), but its Ron/Ginny.

It doesnt have to be AU, im open for sort of Canon-based too
