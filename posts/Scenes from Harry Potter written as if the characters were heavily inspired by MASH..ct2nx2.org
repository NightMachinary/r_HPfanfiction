Harry and Ron are Hawkeye and BJ, naturally. Hermione is Charles Emerson Winchester, III.

Malfoy is +Ferret Face+ Frank Burns. Neville is Radar, possibly? Voldemort is Flagg. Luna, perhaps, is Klinger. Or Possibly Fred and George are both Klinger.

Margaret Houlihan, Henry Blake, and Sherman T Potter are harder to cast, though. Possibly Remus is Potter? Daphne could be Houlihan, and possibly Dumbledore as Blake.


** Henry Blake would make a hilarious Dumbledore. And Potter might make a pretty good Snape... maybe. I don't remember too much of him.

If Malfoy is Frank, then Houlihan should be Astoria, I think. But that's just me being a huge Draco/Astoria fan.

** I can see Remus being a better Henry, simply because even though Henry is the boss and most (ish) times acts serious, he has that goofy fun side. Dumbledore in fanon is just too goofy. Its easier to see him as Klinger imo than as Henry. Gonna be honest, I don't remember who Sherman T Potter is. But to be fair, I've only watched the first 3 seasons with Trapper. So i don't know who BJ is as well. What about Father Mulcahy being Dumbledore? Always there to give platitudes, ready for a joke or two, and overall lovable character ?
