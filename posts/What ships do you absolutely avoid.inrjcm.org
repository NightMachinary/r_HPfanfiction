Snape was a major supporting character. Harry actually busted his arse working with Snape. Not redeeming him, but getting Snape to forgive himself and move on.

** Ron/Hermione. I came to fanfiction to get a better canon romance, which meant that I binged two million words of Hinny, which often included Ron/Hermione. And throughout that binge, I realised two things. I absolutely hate big Weasley family scenes/fics with a burning passion since I am not invested in 90% of the involved characters and yet have to suffer through thousands of words of Weasleys in +all shades+ red which are in the way of the plot. But more importantly, despite often being written very toxic, it is the likely outcome for a Ron/Hermione relationship.

Because without fail, it always ends in "they express their love through fighting", which is one of the worst tropes in fiction. The best couples are those which can resolve their issues without a single fight because that's called communication. Yet unfortunately, to me that is the logical conclusion of the canonical relationship between those two. Like, for Harry/Ginny or Harry/Hermione, you can point at the scenes which show why they'd make a great couple. But which scenes are there for Ron/Hermione? When Ron was a dick to Lavender? When Hermione was? When they refused to talk to each other in PoA? Their Yule Ball fight?

** *Absolutely*? Any pairing of teacher and student. Even that I could see myself making exceptions for a 20yo professor being romanced by a 6th or 7th year, but not if the professor initiates.

Everything else is situational, but in general I avoid slash, age gap (half age plus seven is a good limit to stand by, and yes that makes Bill/Fleur and Remus/Tonks rather borderline pairings to me) and anything involving death eaters and Harry's generation.

**** The idea behind James/Lily is great, the stories around are not.

You have the entire first war to play around with, and yet as far as I know there isn't a single fic which follows them through it to a victorious conclusion (I made a few request threads along those lines and got 0 replies with stories which fit that).
