** Can you please elaborate on what you are writing? Fanfic or original story? If fanfic, what pairings and what is the general plot? If you could also link to some of your previous work, that may give people a better idea of whether this is something they are willing to invest their time in to and will enjoy doing.

*** Seconded. I've done a bit of beta work, but only for fics I've either started reading already and know I'm into or have some idea of what the story was. I have no problem putting in the time and effort, but I need to know it's a fic I'm interested in

*** I posted this on [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]], and thus, am writing fanfiction for Harry Potter.

Have not decided on a set pairing yet, but there will be many romantic encounters (like most teenagers). I will not write a committed relationship before 4th year, because I don't think anyone should be doing that at 11-13.

*General Plot. The story is AU 20 years later (Harry was born on July 31 2000).*

*Prologue:* Upon arriving at the Potter Cottage, Voldemort is surprised to find two children in the cot rather than one. He takes a gamble, and escapes with Harry, apparating to Magical Tutshill just to be safe. There, he attempts to curse Harry, only for it to backfire on him. With Voldemort defeated, Harry is left alone on the street, and is eventually found and taken in by a couple of wizarding newly-weds, the Portwoods, who notice immediately the Dark Magic resonating from his scar. They resolve to try and cure him. The Potters are live, Sirius is never imprisoned, and Pettigrew is taken care of.

*Chapter 2:* Harry grows up to have a normal, if secluded childhood, as there are a lack of wizarding children, and he distrusts the muggles. Harry is raised as a pureblood, though not as bigoted. On his 8th Anniversary (they don't know his actual birthday) the Portwoods decide to travel the world in search for a cure for Harry's scar.

*Book One:* Harry's journey throughout the world, visiting Germany, Egypt, Greece, France, Brazil and the USA. He learns a lot about the world, and loves learning all kinds of new and magical things, but never had the chance to establish a human friendship.

*Book Two:* Harry's First Year at Hogwarts. Mostly Canon-compliant, but I'm keeping it vague because I don't want any spoilers. Through the letter sent out to the students, Dumbledore finds out that Harry Potter might still be alive. This follows up to a Harry that doesn't want to leave his adoptive parents, the Portwoods, and the Potters who plan to gain legal custody of him. Until Yuletide, only a very select few actually knew about Harry's true birth name. After that, Harry is revealed to the world as a Potter, and complications follow. All of this while the events of Philosophers stone occur, so a very full year.

*Book Three:* Follows, again, COS canon. Will focus a lot on characters and development. Maybe some residual politics. Likely to be the shortest of the series.

*Book Four* will have two subplots (besides prisoners escaping) and will be mostly non-canon

*Five* will use the standard oh look here is the Triwizard Tournament, have fun! But with a pretty cool twist imo. Also have some other subplot.

*Book Six* will finalize the Horcrux Hunt that has been going on for years, and stuff will happen (Canon Book Six and Seven will be implemented into this, I expect it to be one of the longest of the series)

*Seven, Eight* will still be in Hogwarts, but the main events will be different. Obviously. This is where I will continue to expand my AU, as I did in Book One. I will focus more on characters, the world, magic and something /far/ worse than a dark lord.

(It's possible that I might continue the series into Harry's early twenties, but that will be AU)

As you can see, Book One and Two are pretty fully planned out. I'm writing both at the same time, and I've got 25k for Book one and 10k for book two.

I /have/ written other works, though they aren't fanfiction, nor are they as large. You can find some of them at [[/r/Pezoas_Archives][r/Pezoas_Archives]]. These, however, are OLD. I wrote them around two years ago, and I'd like to believe I've gotten better as a writer. [[/u/FabricioPezoa][u/FabricioPezoa]] is my alt.

If you have any more questions, please go ahead.
