I'm looking for an old fic I read literally years ago and haven't been able to find since.

It's about Harry being banished to space in a crystal prison, where he spends hundreds of years in suspended animation. I can't remember why he was banished, but he had done something and people were afraid.

Once banished, the magical population begin to notice that magic is fading and try to find a solution. Muggles begin to colonise the solar system in the next few centuries. FTL travel is never discovered so humanity is bound to the solar system.

Eventually Harry is discovered by a research vessel and whilst they are studying his prison they are attacked and boarded by pirates. Harry awakens, subdues everyone and commanders the ships. This pretty much sets the tone for the rest of the fic.

Memories hazy, but Harry notices his magic isn't replenishing once he uses it so decides to try heading back to Earth to find a solution, only to discover Earth has been in isolation for years and it's almost impossible to land.

He eventually finds a way after using his magic to upgrade ships and becoming basically a privateer for the solar nations and fighting in many battles.

He gets back to Earth and fixes his magic, but loses an eye in the process, can't remember how though.

Other bits I remember is the old magical families are still about, but all are squibs. The Blacks are powerful pirate lords, I think a Lestrange owns a massive station, etc. I remember the Lestrange was very eccentric, with see-through trousers and bull testicles as his favourite food.

If anyone knows what this fic's called or where I can find it again, I'd been enormously grateful.


** That be [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/8637910/1][The Star Empire]] by RahXephon. A+ in worldbuilding - the guy essentially created a whole sci-fi universe of his own - and I found it even more interesting than the Harry subplot. Author had a weird fascination with rape scenes, those sour the story a little, but beyond that it's a good fic.

*** Holy flying hell that was awesome. Can you recommend more stories like it?

I've never seen that recommended before, and damn it was good. Good world building is rare.

**** Glad you liked it! It truly is a uniquely awesome story.

I don't think there's quite anything like it. The author has some more HP/sci-fi stories here and there on the web, google RahXephon fanfiction to find them.
