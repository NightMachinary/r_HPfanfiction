I want to read about their childhood, maybe how they became the tricksters they are. It doesn't necessarily have to be the main plot of a story, but it would be nice.


** My favorite George ship ever. Follows the twins before, during and after hog warts through the eyes of a muggle neighbor. Story's main focus is George, but obviously Fred features as well.
