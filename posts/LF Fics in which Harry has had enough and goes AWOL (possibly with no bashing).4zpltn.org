After reading for the fifth time "Behind Blue Eyes" I realised that I really enjoyed Harry's confused and hurt behaviour, his decision to GTFO and the manhunt that ensues both from Death Eaters especially the Order of the Phoenix, with his friends trying to understand why he did that.

What I'm looking for is something similar, with maybe a focus on his friends' reactions. It could be set in any moment of the saga, like after Sirius' death, or during the super troubled fifth year, or even after Voldemort's death, where he could vanish and the magical world try to find him. I hope I've been not to picky and thanks for your help!


** I like the 'Harry running away' theme a lot:

*Escape*, linkffn(11916243): AU year 6, Voldemort forced Wizengamot to pass a marriage law with the goal to screw over Hermione and Harry, and AD sold Hermione out.

*Finding a Place to Call Home*, linkffn(9885609): one of the few, good Harry/Astoria fics, featuring them running away before Task 1 of TWT.

*Nobody's Hero*, linkffn(7806752): very fluffy Harry/Ginny runaway fic. First chapter required a little SOD, but otherwise quite nice.

*The Sea King*, linkffn(7502511): cute one-shot about Harry leaving magical world after the war and Hermione finally finding him after many years

*What If? ... An Alternative to Order Of The Phoenix*, linkffn(5265558): Harry didn't wait for the hearing, but fled immediately after being warned by the Ministry.
