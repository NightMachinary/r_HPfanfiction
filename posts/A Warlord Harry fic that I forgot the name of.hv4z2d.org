:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It was basically about Voldemort banishing Harry to hell and 10 years later Dumbledore decides,

"You know what? We could probably use the help of the person who is destined to defeat Voldemort!"

Harry gets summoned back only for everyone else to discover that it was 100 years for Harry, not 10 and he's become one of the most feared warlords of hell.

Does anyone know the name of it? I finished it but it was long time ago and I really want re-read it.

Edit: It has been found by the glorious human called razminr11! I am not good enough at using reddit on mobile to put the link in a word so here's a copy/paste:

#+begin_quote
  NaNoWriMo 2019. After Harry Potter is thrown into hell, Britain falls to the dark. The lights only hope is to bring Harry back. But ten years have had their effect on him. Will he be the savior the light had hoped? Or have they merely traded one devil for another.

** Gonna be honest. I spent the past 30 minutes trying to search for you, since I've never heard of a story like it. More often than not it's sent to Azkaban, not to hell. Sadly, while I found like 3 near fics to read at some point in the future, I had no such luck finding anything remotely to the one you're asking for. Sorry.

​

In case you're wondering, the three fics are: Right Side of Hell by NeoMare, Sixteen Years by Council (Which seems like it's one of those once in a blue moon I'll update or abandoned, since while the author seems active, the story hasn't been updated in 4 years.), and Sorry About That Harry by Nigelcat1. (Which is a 91k word story that is a single chapter... apparently complete. Wtf author. Still going to read it probably.)

​

If you do end up finding the story you're looking for, mind messaging me the name? Also, where you read it might help out a bit for people searching. I mainly traversed FF.

**** Shit, my bad. I'm not often on reddit and rarely ever look at my messages since a while back I subbed to a quite prolific author on the HFY subreddit.

In case you haven't already looked the three stories up, here you go.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13256035/30/Right-Side-of-Hell]] (This is actually quite good and has been updated in the past 4 months.)

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9332216/1/Sixteen-Years]] (Haven't started reading it yet because the reason in my previous message.)

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11352516/1/Sorry-About-That-Harry]] (Going to be honest, I've read this one now and it's... ehh. The author is still active and writes other fanfics, and I haven't gotten to check those out yet, but this one is not up my alley. It's not slash at least, but it just feels gimicky and that it was written to be out there. Also, it has a sequel, which looks abandoned.)

​

Also, completely off-topic, but shit, someone actually found the story! Awesome.

** I haven't been able to find it, but I definitely recognize it.

Here's some things I remember. Hopefully, someone will recognize enough to find it.

- First thing Harry does after being brought back from hell is summon his lieutenant who is a succubus.
- Hermione is in a coma, the succubus heals her, we later find out Ron caused it.
- Harry rescues some girls from a death eater 'entertainment' house, Luna is one of them, she's gone somewhat crazy.

Doesn't help that I don't even know what site it's on. Fanfiction? Likely but I have /no/ idea how to work Fanfiction. AO3? Less likely though I am more familiar. I hope someone has read this and remembers and links it. That's why I set a reminder like many others - in the hopes that someone researchers for a few hours and finds it or that someone has read it recently and links it.

** I doubt either of these are it, the details are probably too different to get mixed up, but here are the closest fics I've seen.

Linkffn(Inquisitor Carrow and the GodEmperorless Heathens by littlewhitecat) - Harry somehow gets teleported 38,000 years into the future. Warhammer 40k. He becomes a sort of psyker Space Marine Inquisitor. By the time he returns it has been perhaps a year or two for Hogwarts, but something like 300 years for Harry.

Linkffn(Harry Potter the Undead Slayer by Scott the Wanderer) - Harry ends up in some alternate setting where he's raised to be some kind of monster slayer. He gets summoned back by the Goblet of Fire along with a vampire that he was in the middle of fighting. Pretty sure he's covered in magical tattoos. It hasn't been /that/ long for him, but IIRC he is a full grown adult instead of being 14 like he should've been.
