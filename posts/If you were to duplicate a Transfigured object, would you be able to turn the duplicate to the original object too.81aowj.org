** I would say no. The duplicate object doesn't have the same 'history' attached to it, so there wouldn't be anything to revert to.

That 'history' is probably the kind of magical value that can't be replicated, according to one of the exceptions to Gamp's law of elemental transfiguration.

** I would say it depends on your method/spell. Are you creating a true duplicate or just creating something based off of what you are currently observing.

Because, a transfigured object is still the original object just temporarily forced into another's form which is why the process can be reversed and transfigurations revert eventually.

*** Which is also why transfiguration can't create food. Because a rock you turn into a nice roast is still a rock.

That is until you get to transmutation; but, that is generally left to mages or extreme masters of transfiguration.

** The question isn't 'can a duplicate of a transfigured object be itself untransfigured?', but rather, 'how can untransfiguring duplicated objects be used in telling a good story?'.
