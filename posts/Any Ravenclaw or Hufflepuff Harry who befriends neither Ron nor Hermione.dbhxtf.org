** linkffn(The Art of Self-Fashioning) Ravenclaw Harry in a universe where Nevile is the BWL and Harry's parents end up at St. Mungos. While a lot of the same stuff from canon occurs, it isn't depicted in the work so much as Harry isn't apart of the Golden Trio. Instead it focuses on Harry's efforts of becoming a master at transfiguration (Plus wizarding war stuff later on). Well written, dark, complete.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.
