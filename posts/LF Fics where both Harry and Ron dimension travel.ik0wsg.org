Exactly what it says on the tin. I'm looking for fics where adult Ron and Harry, whether aurors, mercenaries, or some other career, both get hurled into another world. I've read Gryffindors Never Die, and while it is awesome, it doesn't quite scratch the itch. We have tons of great crossovers like The Havoc Side of the Force and Shadow of Angmar, where Harry ends up alone in another world. I want fics where his best friend (and /only/ his best friend) is at his side. I prefer crossovers, but I'd like to see one where they end up in the Marauder era (or even during Tom's school years) and just generally chaos their way through fixing everything. Thanks!


** There's Linkffn(The Granger Principle) which fits somewhat and is really quiete good.

Instead of canon Harry and Ron traveling into some weird alternative universe, it's the AU Harry and Ron (and Luna, Ginny, Dumbledore and Grindelwald) who go to the canon-like universe and mess things up. They're professionals and don't just bungle their way through, they plan missions out carefully but it still usually ends up with them narrowly escaping the crime scene shrunken to ant man size in Luna's remote controlled toy helicopter while everything explodes behind them.

And Luna meets Luna from another dimension and they're the ones who cause the real chaos.

  It seemed like a routine assignment for CI5 officers Ron Weasley and Harry Potter: Investigate a physicist who had caught the attention of some unsavoury elements. Little did they know that Dr Hermione Granger would turn out to have more secrets than Ron would have thought possible.

** Have you read Powerful Magical Artifact by kathryn518: linkffn(13224282)? It's unfinished but it's the only one I could think of off the top of my head.

  The Goblet of Fire is a powerful magical artifact. Powerful enough to lock four powerful magicals to a binding magical contract even when one is unwilling. What else can it do to fulfill a contract? Pull someone to fulfill a contract from a distance? Reach across space and time? Summon the dead?
