:END:
I'm trying to find this specific fanfic,please help. I remember bits and parts of it. However the most relevant parts are: *It differs from canon from 4th year

Most important part:- 1.Cedric goes with Harry to the graveyard but he doesn't die. 2.Harry does not join the DA. Instead Cedric(who witnesses the birth of Voldemort) and Hermione leads the DA. (P.S 1 and 2 are the most standout points for this fan fiction)

Some other points: *During 5th Harry is estranged from Ron and Hermione. *Harry doesn't care if people believe him about Voldemort rising.
