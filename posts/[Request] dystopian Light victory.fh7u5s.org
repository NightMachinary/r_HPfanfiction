Anything after the Battle of Hogwarts, not the war itself.

*** Yes, that's the one I thought of. It's disturbingly plausible.

** It started innocently enough.

Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley. The three heroes that destroyed You-Kno... hah, /Voldemort/ for good. When the dust settled and the dead were buried, everyone expected them to be the shining new light to lead the wizarding word.

Too bad too much light can blind.

Potter and Weasley went straight into the Aurors - no one was going to tell the war heroes they weren't qualified. A year later, Potter had pushed through a restructure of the entire Auror Corps - extremely strict new laws on dark magic, an Oath to the Department Head to uphold the law to the best of their abilities, and a take-no-prisoners protocol for violent criminals.

People liked the changes, liked knowing that people like the Death Eaters wouldn't be getting a slap on the wrist after bribing their way out of prison.

Granger went back to Hogwarts, graduated top of her class, and proceeded to dominate the Wizengamot. With Potter's backing, she became the youngest Minister of Magic in Britain's history, and muggleborns came out of the woodwork to keep her in office. ‘Course it helped that her most influential and outspoken political opponent - Draco Malfoy - mysteriously vanished after he got a little too vocal in his opposition. The Pureblood faction was pretty quiet after that.

Seemed like every day some new regulation came out - house elves must be paid with vacation, goblins can carry wands, departments must staff at least 30% muggleborns.

Though I suppose I should be saying “first generational”, with that new hundred galleon fine for using certain slurs.

Don't know who did it - pureblood sick of the new laws, punk kid desperate for some galleons, hell could have been a merc, but one day a very pregnant Ginny Potter turned up dead.

People were absolutely furious, calling out for blood - retired Quidditch star, married the Man-Who-Conquered, and pregnant to boot; they couldn't push the new powers for Aurors fast enough- and Head Auror Potter became the first Head of Domestic Security.

Him and his task force cracked down /hard/ on anyone remotely suspicious. Every pureblood and every Slytherin was being watched, Knockturn was gutted, hell even Wizengamot members were brought in for questioning. Anyone who didn't comply was given a few days in Azkaban to loosen their lips - if the mobs didn't get to them first.

The years after just kept getting worse. Domestic Security authorized to search homes without a warrant. Authorized to hold suspects for questioning indefinitely. Authorized to plant listening charms in homes.

Authorized to cast the Unforgivables.

That was a hell of a shock - High Minister Granger snuck that through while she was giving speeches at the tenth year anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts.

They're coming for me, now. “Sedition against the Ministry,” they're calling it. In my day they called it “writing to the Quibbler.” Little Luna Lovegood is probably in a cell somewhere for publishing my complaints. Doubt I'll get that far, Slytherin's usually just “disappear.”

Long live the fuckin' Ministry.

** I don't think that Dumbledore would allow the Wizarding World to become any more dystopian than it already is. It's good that you mentioned post battle of Hogwarts for I can easily see the Golden Trio and the DA hunting down Death Eaters after the War.

*** After the battle he really can't do much, considering his dead-ness and all that.

Either the immediate days post battle or something more distant works fine.
