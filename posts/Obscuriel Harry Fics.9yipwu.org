Following crimes of grindlewarld I'm really craving some obscurus Harry fics. No other restrictions but preferably on the longer side, anybody know any?


** The only Obscurial!Harry fics I've seen have been in story dump collections, nothing seperate. I know Racke has one, but don't remember who the other one was that I read recently.

** I remember reading a few, but for most of them updates were a while ago.. I did a quick tag search in my ao3 bookmarks, don't remember much of the results I got from that so can't recommend one over the others, but I do bookmark the fics I enjoy most so hopefully there'll be something to your liking :3

** Araceil has a pseudo-obscurial!Harry (who adopts an obscurial child), but his obscurial background isn't revealed until about half way through the fic. linkffn(12296472)

  Newt/Harry, Timetravel Shenanigans, Canon Divergent. His plan was to avoid changing the timeline. He knew he wouldn't be able to resist if the opportunity presented itself. So he fled to Africa, where opportunity found him instead.

  FANTASTIC BEASTS SPOILERS! What if the Dursleys had been a bit more devoted to beating the magic out of Harry? Newt Scamander and Albus Dumbledore both have long and dark histories, but there is one thing they both know. They would do anything and fight anyone to prevent the death of one final Obscurial.
