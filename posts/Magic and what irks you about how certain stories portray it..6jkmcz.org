** - Dictionary magic, where all you really need to do to learn a spell is to look up the incantation and wand movements (and practice it a bit). This massively undermines the "school of magic" nature of Hogwarts - the "there's more to magic than incantations" aspect of magic which is what divides wizards from each other.

- "It's all about intent", aka wish magic, where the key to being a powerful wizard is just wanting things very badly or visualising the result. Again, this undermines the study element of magical competence and, again, raises questions of how it is we see such a wide variety of magical capabilities.

- Contrary to the OP, too much redundancy e.g. multiple shield charms rather than *the* shield charm which can be cast with a variety of effects and strengths. This is, in a way, a reiteration of the dictionary magic point: instead of spell variation being about just looking up another spell, it is about truly understanding the nature of the spell you are using - and magic more generally - such that you can manipulate and adjust it.

- Magic explained with reference or analogy to physical energy rather than as a truly supernatural force.

- Too much emphasis on "point and shoot" jet of light spells, leading to tennis match duels.

- Slow magic which is easy to dodge.

*** I do think that the second one is not necessarily bad in itself. I mean, sure, “intent”, but is it really that easy to focus on just one need to the point where nothing else matters and your magic acts on it? Is it really something that just anyone could achieve with just some training and have full control over it?

We do know that accidental magic is to some degree about intent, but even then it isn't controlled, it takes all the intent for a lot of things that the wizard or witch has and then does /something/, with that something more often than not being not really something that they wanted to happen.

As such, I could see some part of magic being based on intent. Not all of it, certainly, but some. Though, obviously, when people use that to mean that Harry has the greatestest intent of all wizardseses and thus is the most powerful, it becomes worthy of drowning it it bleach; and yes, the not-exactly-correct way of writing certain words is intentional.

*** Agreed on most points, even slightly with the third one that disagrees with my OP. I never wanted my intention to take out the need to understand spells and Magic, I just think that a Spell with Natural Power that you pump more energy on top of to make stronger (or just a hardening charm of some sort) makes more sense than using an incredibly weak spell and pumping out Magic to make it stronger. There's also the fact that different shields could be better at different things/more powerful against certain branches of Magic. It also makes for more thinking on the duellist's side. Think about this, if Protego is mass-produced, and immensely known, and it's the only shield spell you use, it doesn't matter how intricately you know its ins and outs, someone can easily come up with a Powerful Anti-Magic (like a counter spell) to stop it in its tracks.

Here is your problem, you think of magic as an energy that needs to be pumped into a spell. But there are no indications that this is what determines spell's strength. To the contrary, we always have specialization in category of spells mentioned (Lockhart and memory charms overspecialization, treating McGonagall as a limit when talking about size limitations of transfiguration in GoF). Reject energy, and then everything will make more sense.

Why not avoid the situation of having a limited shield arsenal that can be anti-magic'd if you can just find a more powerful and unknown shield? It's not hard, the Potterverse has a virtually infinite number of spells anyways according to Rowling. Especially in Harry's situation, if someone comes at him with a spell that can take out his Protego faster than he can cast it, the Death Eater won't just let him run away to find a new one, he's gonna kill him. Sure, with regular Potterverse Characters who aren't in Combat, and don't even need to touch Battle-Magic and Defensive Magic within their life, it'd make sense that you'd only have the bare-minimum.

There is an element of muscle memory involved. In a duel, it's important to be able to cast spells as fast as possible. That requires more than just recalling which spell is appropriate for the situation. You have to instinctually be able to cast the spell.

************** Do we even know if the Unforgivable's have wand movements? Regardless, saying that the wizard swished his wand for every spell gets redundant anyway. After a certain point, the audience must assume that is happening even if the author does not explicitly say so.

There's something called balance. There's no point in learning something like 50 different stunning spells. A smart wizard would choose 2 or 3 at most. Even that's stretching it if they are all blocked by the same spell.

As shown in canon, wizards generally learn spells with different effects. They choose which spells to use based on the circumstances. If the wizard knows a stunning spell won't work on their target they are more likely to choose a spell that fits the scenario, no?

What's the point of debating with a person who chooses to disregard valid points? That's why I called you dense. You are purposefully being difficult and dragging this out. For what purpose I don't know. Do you really expect me to properly debate over a fictional book series? I don't give a fuck if Ad Hominem statements are improper. What you are doing is just as bad.

Also, you dodged the main arguments once again. Originally, you made the statement that wizards need to use unknown spells to win duels. This has been disproven by canon. This entire thread has been pointless. I was right from the beginning.

There may be no point in learning 50 different stunning spells. But there is a point in mastering 50 different stunning spells.

** Magical cores, or other such "energy" systems, or power levels in general. These systems add nothing to a story except rules for the author to constrain everything by or allow the protagonist to later break. It is usually ham-fisted or otherwise poorly presented, and more often than not just sounds dumb.

"x has a depleted magical core."

Whenever I see shit like this I pretty much have to stop, as all I picture are wizards having little phone-battery charge bars in their watches or something, and each spell consuming a specific percentage of their "magical core" i.e. battery. It breaks all immersion and ruins some of the mystique of magic being... you know, /magic/.

Power levels tie into this, but mostly because it's dumb to have characters be - innately - orders of magnitude ahead of their peers forever, and there being nothing anyone can do about it.

Plus, not a single fic with power levels that I've seen has had a Vegeta reference, and that's just plain unacceptable.

My problem with making it quantifiable in the way magical cores do is that it doesn't add /anything/ to a story, only - as I said - rules that Harry or other characters can then subsequently break. I don't mind people adding new stuff to the HP Universe (it's why we're all here, isn't it?) but magical cores are a silly, unnecessary addition. I prefer magic to be left ambiguous and mystical, rather than some fake-science-BS /a la/ Midichlorians from Star Wars.

Plus whenever someone mentions a magical core I chortle/throw up in my mouth a little because it sounds totally stupid, and I have no idea how anyone could say it with a straight face. Bonus vomit to stories that try and /visualise/ the magical core, and describe its /texture/ or /viscosity/ or some such BS. Have encountered a story that did this before and closed that tab /right fucking then/.

- Having magic rely on one true incantation (for example, if you wanted to summon something, the only possible way you could do that is by saying "Accio"). It makes it seem, to me, like Magic is some kind of Roman invention and not a global thing.

- Depicting non-European magic identically to European magic (i.e. with spells and Latin-based incantations). I really, really, like when an author creates magical traditions for other cultures (like Voodoo or Shamanism)

- Making magic hereditary/innate. For example, a wizard being "born powerful" or "having a huge magical core", simply because then Harry doesn't win through his own decisions but rather through superior genetics.

- This extends to having Parsletongue, Legimency, and other magical talents being "innate". I have no problem with natural-born parselmouths, but I do get ticked off if there's /no/ way to learn Parseltongue or how to be a Legimens.

I mean, it's possible that you can be born powerful from what we see in the HPverse, in fact, Harry in canon was born powerful as well. Even Dumbledore admits it when he talks to him about Horace. I don't really think anyone cares much about Harry being superpowerful, not even the writers of the Godlike Harry fics, they just don't know to pace themselves, or write Magic in an interesting way. It's almost always the lack of variety I talked about, followed by training montage where Harry reads books and somehow that makes him more powerful, then he beats Voldemort in one year. I would rather have a multibook lead up to it. Harry accumulating power over time, even if he learns every spell easily because he's a natural prodigy, it won't make Voldemort any less difficult to beat.

I believe that's because Salazar Slytherin locked his ability into his DNA or something like that. Like a sort of mix between the Fiedlius and the Incorporate Bond from The Magicians (if you haven't read The Magicians, an Incorporate Bond is the act of locking something in the 4th dimension and having it be on the physical plane, therefore making it theoretically unbreakable/unlockable/unmoveable unless by an immense amount of Magic. This sort of makes sense, as an immense amount of power was used that day in the house, so when Voldemort's body exploded it caused some of his DNA to merge with Harry's, therefore giving him the ability of Parseltongue. I'm not too sure I buy that it was the Horcrux the whole time.

These things don't actually contradict my "no dictionary magic" idea. The proposal is roughly thus: what defines a spell is what it does, not its incantation. If one imagines magical theory as a kind of network of connected concepts, a spell is a node on that network - a particular combination of concepts which has a certain effect. The incantation is a kind of label or shorthand reference for the spell's conceptual structure.

A wizard in France and a wizard in China could independently create two spells with two incantations which do the same thing. But if they do the same thing then they have the same nature and therefore depend on the same concepts/magical theory to underpin their casting. The "two spells" are actually the same one spell - just with two different incantations that can be used to invoke the same thing.

I have no problem with a different shield spells that do /slightly/ different things, because (in my mind) all the incantations are pretty arbitrary. So when a fic has 5 different shield charms, I don't really have too much of a problem with it as long as they're all clearly defined (and not "this spell is just better than that spell").

It's the same as casting spells, really. Waving a wand and saying an incantation are not inherently magical things, nor is knowing magical theory. But if a Muggle tried them, nothing would happen.

Reminds me of a fic I read where a muggleborn student (years after the war) had variating results in his potion class. I can't remember well, but basically sometimes they were great, and sometimes, despite doing everything correctly, the potion didn't work. It was because he didn't think of it as magic or something like that, thus only combining ingredients like a muggle would do, so his end result lacked the magical intent needed to differentiate a magical potion from just ingredients mixed by a muggle. Children raised by wizards didn't have that issue because they didn't grow up with having to think about magic, they just knew it was there. I don't explain it very well, but it was a very interesting point in this story.

** I'm getting irritated at the irritation.

"Magic can't be that simple. What professionals do is way beyond what some kids in school are taught."

Fuck that noise- there is no University, no guildhall, no apprenticeships; the bulk of magical theory is taught at Hogwarts with the assumption that the students will never need to be taught again. Certainly there are professions that require further on-the-job training, but that still only builds on the fundamentals of what the Weasley twins fully understood by the time they sat their OWLs. Stop trying to make it stupidly cryptic. Everything we see in the books was done by one wizard or another at some point, so don't tell me that Hermione couldn't enchant her kids' ceiling to show the sky, just like the Great Hall at Hogwarts.

There is a significant difference in applied use of these principles when facing someone like Dumbledore, but the Aurors weren't that far behind him and Riddle. Dumbledore's mention of their impendng arrival sent Voldemort out of the Ministry.

Why not sew magic into your robes? Why not create spells using known concepts and a bit of ingenuity? Snape did it when he was still underage. The Marauders made the Map and became Animagi, including weak-willed Peter.

Yeah, it's called the Stunner because that's what Stupefy does. No other spell does quite that, and its very effective, very reliable, which is why two dozen adults apparated in and cast one when they found Harry near the Dark Mark at the World Cup.

I think with magic, it could be that someone adheres to a particular theory on some magical concept and their understanding maybe allows them to master certain magic. Another wizard might have a different theoretical view on that concept, which would let him master a different kind of magic. And neither of them are wrong, because magic isn't science, nothing is stopping it from being self-contradictory and yet making perfect sense. I view Hogwarts education as a foundation, which then wizards and witches individually interpret and achieve particular results: Lockhart masters Memory Charms, McGonagall masters Transfiguration, meanwhile Dumbledore and Voldemort become archwizards because they're just that in tune with magic.

If there was proof enough to call it an undeniable fact, then it wouldn't be a theory, it would most definitely be a law. That's the whole reason I don't see Magical Theory as being useful. It's assumptions based on Magic that are unfounded and for some reason aren't capable of being tested, therefore that in itself makes it untrue. I have no idea how "No Food creation" became a law of Magic it's incredibly inconsistent with a lot of the things we've seen so far, especially since Magic is capable of creating new matter (Conjurations/Creations).

****** I see Magical Theories being like Magical Philosophy, a whole bunch of ideas that may or may not contradict each other, that attempts to describe the inner working of magic. There is no way to have a definite Magical Science that explains magic perfectly. Magical phenomenons are explained with these ideas. It's sort of how in canon Dumbledore would have guesses on why certain things happen, but he doesn't know explicitly. It's pretty famous, but Taure's Alexander series does an extremely good job of explaining this. It's basically my headcanon now.

Is Magical Theory useful? It's the only thing they have for explaining magic. Well for simple spells probably not, but when dealing with complex magic, I think it's necessary. You can't just wave your wand, speak some words and then do something complex like casting a Taboo or hiding a secret within a soul.

I don't believe Magical laws are rigidly define. We've seen how Voldemort did something that was considered impossible like unaided flight. And yes there are contradictions. I think it's akin to "for the past 1000 years all our attempts to create food has failed maybe it's impossible" and that then became a Law. But, I do believe with the right ideas and concepts such a thing can be done. Again Taure does a good job of explaining how magic progresses and advance.
