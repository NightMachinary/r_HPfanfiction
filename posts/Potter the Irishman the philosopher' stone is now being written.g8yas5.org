** You know, the different upbringing should definitely have an impact on the plot. Maybe he could get along with Seamus more? Maybe he could have a good relationship with a family member or a friend in Ireland? It's the early 90s and considering what went on in Ireland around that time, maybe he could have a friend who has a cousin who knows someone in the IRA who could get him some 'supplies'.

** But what did you do except rewrite the books with different accents? Does the diverging point have any real effect on the story or are you just writing the same events year one through seven with a mostly Irish Harry? Because it's not really something to brag about if it's the latter.
