** You're my Density linkffn(11033616)

Harry tells the Ministry to fuck off during his trial. They bind his magic and obliviate him. Things pretty much immediately go to shit and years later Hermione finds him and uses time travel to try and fix things. Harry doesn't get his memory back, he remains a 20-year old that just found out about magic in a kid's body.

  Just Suppose Harry hadn't heeded his godfather's advice, and actually lost his temper at his trial? Time travel fic and title is 'Back to the Future' joke.

  Harry and Rose Potter faced everything together...until the Ministry ripped him away from her. Now, finally, Rose - with the assistance of Gabrielle Delacour - has found him again. They've got a plan to fix what was broken; and maybe get a bit of revenge along the way. Pairing: Harry/OFC/Gabrielle (twincest).

** The only story I know of in which Harry has his knowledge of magic obliviated (apart from You're My Density, which has already been mentioned) is linkao3(The Case of the Missing Wizard by IshtarsDream), in which Umbridge tries to have Harry obliviated during the summer after 4th year. It's a cross with Sherlock, and unfortunately unfinished.

Most of the other "Harry was obliviated" stories I know of involve Harry discovering that Dumbledore or Ginny (or both) obliviated him to keep him under control, but still knowing of magic.

  The summer after the Tri-Wizard Tournament, Harry Potter disappeared. Utterly. Twenty years later, Sherlock Holmes stumbled onto the case.
