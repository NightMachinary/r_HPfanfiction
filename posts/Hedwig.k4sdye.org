Anyone else think it would be interesting if harry named one of his daughters after Hedwig.

** Hedwig Dolores Potter, you were named after the two most important birds in my life, one of them is your mother.

*** Hedwig was an absolute minx in the sheets it seems then. If it wasn't for an accidental loophole in one of Dolores' bigoted laws, that allowed a Witch or Wizard to marry an animal, provided they have a matching animagus form, Hedwig Junior would have never been born.
