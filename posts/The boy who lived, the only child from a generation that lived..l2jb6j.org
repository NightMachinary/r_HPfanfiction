Has anyone seen any stories similar to "the boy who lived" by Gatalicious? Or is it unique?

Premise of the story is that after hearing the prophecy voldemort decided to kill every magical child.

That halloween night every child under the age of 3 died. Every child except one, Harry Potter, the boy who lived.

It's a chilling premise, Harry will be the only child in his year, the year above will be empty as will the year below. The heart was pulled out of the wizarding world and we have to watch them cope.

Hands up to them it's a new one for me.


** Honestly, would probably be more interesting if it was only magical britain.

For a single child they would almost certainly end up taking classes with the kids two years older or younger. Also completely negating any of the 'i'm treated different' issues as, well, being the only one in his year...

Now say there are only 3-6 kids in those three years, all muggleborn except Harry. That could have very fun group dynamics.

Harry is the odd man out in his year, given he is not a muggleborn. Sensitive to what singles him out more.

But his year as a whole is also out of sync with general wizarding culture, so they get singled out because of it.

Hmm, might have to write a short for this...

I had thought both possibilities had potential, they are quite different stories.

One is a He alone story about coping One is a social dynamics story about the differences

** So if every child under 3 was killed, Ron, Ginny, and maybe the twins would have all been dead. What about Death Eater kids? Did Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, etc. all live? And what about the Muggleborns?

*** In this story it's every child, in effectively a holocaust. They turn to dust, ron turns to dust in George's hands. Halloween is simply called remembrance day.

Does raise questions about what happens to the death eater parents, how would they support him? Maybe they are bound to him so guenuinely have no choice but many are conflicted? Do they know the DL is dead? Have they had a change of heart?

There could be lots of possibilities of the concept , in this case its a ritual, maybe it could have been an order and the DEs carry it out. Maybe they get the MBs, maybe only DE kids live, how do people react to the only living child of an age group? Why not their child?

Maybe as the child turned to dust the dust stuck, like a tattoo. So now so many parents have the silhouette of their child pressed against their chest. A Permanent reminder of their child and their loss.

As Harry walks into the hall he can see here and there, older children with their fingers black.

It would be much like the survivors of the holocaust, an event so earth shaking as to change society forever.

Will they talk? How do people greave? How does life go on?

**** One of the big changes I would see is that every Death Eater will be brutally punished for allowing Voldemort to gain the power needed to achieve this atrocity.

There will be no bullshit corruption allowed that would let Death Eaters claim "Imperious". The public would literally march on the Ministry and murder the Wizengomet if they tried.

  What if when Voldemort heard the prophecy, he decided that not only would he go after Neville and Harry, but every child born in that year?

** Is anyone still following this story? The author came back after a *long* hiatus and has been posting pretty regularly every week. Six new chapters are up (including one today).

After the events in Chapter 10, there was almost like a soft reset as mysteries and conflicts were being set up for the following 4-5 chapters. But as of Chapter 16 (today's chapter), we are officially in the land of batshit crazy again as Harry's summer after first year progresses.

I'm not going to say this fic even cracks my top 20 (yet), but I am impressed by the novelty (to me anyway) of the author's ideas (cue someone telling me all the ideas are stolen hehe).

It also looks like this isn't going to be an attempted rewrite of 7 years of HP, author mentioned that as of Chapter 16, we're past the halfway mark. I'm kinda afraid of what's going to happen to Harry moving forward. The way Chapter 16 ended and looking at the Author's past treatment of the protagonist, I am not feeling too optimistic.

***** But Voldemort was interested in a different form of power than that of a world tyrant. He never placed himself in any position of power (not as Minister for Magic and not as Headmaster at Hogwarts) and after he took over Magical Britain he pretty much allowed the Death Eaters to rule as the pleased while he was searching for the Elder Wand. I think he wanted to maintain some sort of mythical presence of which people were afraid but not really knowing what he was up to. And for that form of control, violence and terror seem more adequate than some machiavellian scheming.

****** Sure, if we're sticking to the level of insanity Voldemort was at that point, so I guess if we do Voldemort kills all babies and then tries to kill Harry and then canon events more or less ensue until Harry is of age we can kind of stick with Voldemort being able to act on his intentions fully. Imo that just doesn't follow enough logic.

In reality what would happen with a full 3 years of babies dead is that everyone would be struggling to hide that type of massacre from Muggles and when Voldemort finally comes back, he would then have to contend with an international force of some sort.

Like I can believe that those are his canon motivations (which, still kind of debatable. Just because he had a puppet government doesn't mean he wouldn't have installed himself somewhere eventually. A coup is still politics), but him not caring doesn't mean he wouldn't have to deal with it.

He either was as secretive and cunning as he is described in the books and we only know about his moves because we are told as readers (although I find it hard to believe considering that the year before he made it no secret that he was back and was actively killing people, even little children), he is so powerful that no wizard alive can oppose him or the magical community is so divided, so ignorant and so incompetent that they can't manage to take a stand. Voldemort kills the Headmaster of Hogwarts, a Head of the DMLE and enslaves the other, forces a Minister for Magic to resign and kills another and no one is capable to do anything about it.

******** I mean, wasn't the majority of his rise supposed to mirror what happened with the Hitler regime? The German government was recovering from the last war, a bit of an unstable mess during peacetime while they were supposed to be figuring shit out, weak leaders that were easily taken advantage of, streaked with that steady but growing resentment towards Jews?

Plus, you kind of prove my point there either way. Those are all things we're kind of supposed to gloss over/pretend that people are just making moves we're not hearing about, so the improvement would be to make a government overthrow more realistic, and more believable. Like an actual response from muggle Britain, or international investigation and sanctions.
