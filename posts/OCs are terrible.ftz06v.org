Terrible, but often beautiful. I'm one for long fics so you really get into the characters and their personality and contribution and backstories. And then they're gone. Forever. The truly magical thing about fanfic (esp with such a massive fanbase like hp) is that you never really have to say goodbye to the characters. You finish the fic? Fine, but you still get to see Harry in the next one! And OCs are so tantalising because you get over it, sure, but it's still a what if. A possibility.


** “They got us in the first half, not gonna lie.”

But seriously, I read that title and thought it was going in a whole other direction. Not that I'm complaining.

** Fan fiction with Canon characters it's like painting a wall. Even if you bollocks it up, it's still a solid wall. Ocs are like building a wall. If you bollocks it up, the whole thing is shit.

They can be great, but if it goes wrong, it goes very wrong
