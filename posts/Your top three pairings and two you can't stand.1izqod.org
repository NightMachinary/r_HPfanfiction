What are your top three pairings involving Potter characters, and what are two pairings that you dislike (and could possibly make you stop reading)? Can be m/f, m/m or f/f and include characters as minor or major as you want. A brief exaplanation as to why you feel that way is appreciated, but not required.

If you have more than three favourites and two pet hates, feel free to add those as well.


** /Harry/Hermione/

Timeless. Ageless. Should have happened in the books. Hermione brings out Harry's rather withdrawn intelligence; Harry encourages Hermione to accept her emotions and act on them. The brains and the brawn, really. They are the Golden Duo -- Ron was the comic relief! Why did JKR have the genius marry the comic relief???

/Ginny/Luna/

A few of you are probably wtf-ing and yes, I must admit I've hardly read anything with this pairing. I see them as childhood BFFs that grow apart during canon school years, but reconnect after all the losses of the war and find comfort in each other. Ginny helps Luna stay sane with all the stress and Nargles about, while Luna stops Ginny from descending into depression after the loss of Fred.

/Harry/Luna/

The ones I have read are pretty AU. I think this relationship is self-explanatory; Harry's Harry and Luna spices things up.

And for my pet peeves... I guess just Harry/Draco and Severus/Lily. Sirius/Remus, Voldie/anyone, Dumbles/Minerva all disgust me too.

*** I never had a concious thought about Harry/Hermione before reading fanfiction. They don't have any chemistry in the books. Ron and Hermione do have chemistry, but I feel JKR should not have stretched their love story as long as it has become. They could (dare I say /should/?) have gotten together right after his return.

Ron is quite a lot more than just comic relief btw. I think it has something to do with how he was portrayed in the movies.

***** As you said, he was 11. I've said some pretty horrible things as an eleven-year-old and I'm sure you have as well.

To understand why Ron is important, look at Harry and Hermione after Ron left. Do you really believe they were better off without him? Miserable and not speaking to each other? Or look at GoF. Ron and Harry's three-week fight in GoF is memorable because Harry angsted about it constantly. Whereas when Ron and Harry fought on and off with Hermione from December to June of PoA, Harry doesn't dwell on it nearly as much.

Harry needs Hermione to make sure he doesn't do anything too stupid, but he also needs Ron to keep him sane and happy. Hermione's amazing, but Ron represents everything that's good in Harry's life. A best friend, a surrogate family, a fellow Quidditch fan, and someone to joke with in times of stress. Hermione's brilliant, but she's not /fun/. And Harry needs that in his life.

That's my issue with Ron's character, in every book he seems to top himself with being a jerk. Mean to Hermione in 1. Quits talking to Harry in 4 (and doesn't believe him). Has a shallow relationship with Lavender in 6 that he knows makes Hermione upset (whom he also at the time liked... what?) Then just abandons ship for a while in 7.

Plus were they really so unhappy because they needed Ron? Or because the BFF who was supposedly thick and thin, just got all emo and hit the road? I'd be pretty upset if any "friend" did that to me.

I like to think they got together earlier than the final battle. I mean, they fell asleep holding hands in Grimmauld Place and spent an awful lot of time in a tent together between then and May. Maybe there was something going on off-screen (off-page?). One can dream.

*** Harry/Hermione

I never really thought they were a possiblilty, and when I look back on the books, I don't understand how people think they're compatible. I understand why people have the urge to pair awesome Hermione with the hero, but I don't believe that they would make a happy/successful couple.

** I'm not much into pairings and prefer gen stories, frankly. That said, I'll read most anything that's a believable Harry/Female, provided it's not too squicky (Harry crushing on his sister or mother or Narcissa isn't something I enjoy). I won't read anything that has Harry in a slash relationship, even when written by a master of his craft (Sam Storyteller).

** What I read:

/Harry/Tonks/ - because she offers everything Harry needs- fun, wild sex and training from a badass auror who doesn't like rules

/Harry/Luna/ - with Ginny so ill-characterized, Luna seems like the one with the most understanding of Harry's situation. If that's not the basis of a good love story...

/Hermione/[girls]/ - because when Emma Watson gasps, I hear it in my spine. When I imagine Emma Watson gasping, I feel it in the hypothalamus. Because Emma Watson. This should also explain the matter to all the Harry/Hermione naysayers- the Harmony folk have a point, but the membership grew tenfold when Emma got hot.

What I avoid:

/Harry/Draco/ - even the well-written ones seem to bury Harry into a submissive role, which is the real crime against the character. It's bad enough that JKR couldn't make Harry a strong leader; I'm not going to read about Harry being even weaker.

/Harry/Voldemort/ - which is not to say some sort of time-travel Harry trying to redeem Tom Riddle wouldn't be enjoyable. It's that I think of Voldemort as inescapably sexless. There is nothing erotic about him, canonically. He doesn't exude it, he doesn't want it, he'd rather hump a snake. More power to him if it makes him happy and less homicidal, but that doesn't pan out in most cases.

/Honorable mentions/ - I think Sirius/Remus makes more sense than Remus/Tonks. I think Ginny/Draco could be epic if handled right. I think Snape/Lily is because Alan Rickman, but I can't argue against it because Emma Watson, y'dig?

Harry/Ginny is a close second, though Ginny is often portrayed out of character,

Arthur/Molly is nice for a change.

** Harry/Ginny, James/Lily, and Harry/Luna are my favorites, and my least favorites are probably Harry/Hermione and Severus/Hermione. Basically anything that's got Harry with someone he would never have been with in canon (Hermione=his sister, Tom Riddle is his NEMESIS for goodness sake, Severus is possibly his least favorite person in all of Hogwarts, (plus, Harry's straight... along with like everyone in HP except Dumbledore ) ) or that's got an older person with a much younger person (Severus is not going to go for Hermione. She's a little brat to him. He's been in love with Lily for the last 18 years or so, he's not just going to stop because Hermione's so pretty!! No.) Plus it's just weird to have an older person with a younger person. There's so much life experience in between them.

** I'm not sure about favorite. I tend to like Harry/Hermione just because they're great characters. Sure, they have no romantic tendency in canon, but compared to the sorts of OOC that show up elsewhere in fanfic, that's nothing.

I really dislike good/evil pairings: Snape/Hermione, Draco/Harry, Neville/Bellatrix, etc. (yes I count Snape as evil for these purposes: he was on the good side, but he was still an evil person). It's one thing for someone in our world to overlook their crimes, but when a character does so it just doesn't make sense. All of your friends that they hurt, suddenly mean nothing to you?

*** I was wondering if there was actually someone on here that liked Harry/Hermione. Not that it's one of my "active" ships (that is, I'll read it if I find it but I won't go searching for it) but most people here seem to have a passionate loathing for the pairing. Not that I don't get why they don't ship it, but I just never understood this violent dislike that some people have for certain ships. As I mentioned in my own answer I'm a multishipper so I can stand almost anyone with anyone, and I'm always more interested in the dynamics of the relationship than I am in the individual partners.

** My top three are Rose/Scorpius Hermione/Draco and I suppose Hermione/Snape (although that one is a bit far fetched it's a guilty pleasure) I think I like these the most because she's the good girl and she falls for the "bad boy" but I especially love it if scorp/draco/snape turn out to be hard on the outside but soft and mushy on the inside. I'm a hopeless romantic hahaha what can I say? Rose/Scorp is my fav though because JK basically set it up to happen (at least in my mind)

My two least favorite would be Ron/Lavender because I have always had a serious hate for lav lav and also Harry/Hermione because I never ever saw them together in the books so when I read that I have to stop because it's like "what if I was dating MY brother" and then I get immediately grossed out and stop

** My top three pairings would have to be Harry/Draco, Hermione/Snape, and Snape/Lily.

S/L was my first ever ship, so it's always going to be one of my favourites and I can't tell you how excited /The Prince's Tale/ in Deathly Hallows made me. I do want to say, however, that I'm aware of the problems in this ship and why it never worked, or would have worked, in canon; I'm not blind to Snape's faults, but I enjoy reading fics where he does better and is someone Lily could get into a relationship with.

I enjoy H/S because I enjoy relationships with an age difference and I think they're both intelligent people who can challenge each other and Hermione wouldn't put up with any bullshit from Snape; she'd recognise that he could be a better person and encourage him to improve.

As for H/D, it's just such a potential relationship. There's so many possibilities for it to work--Harry turns dark, Draco turns light, neither turns completely to the other side but they meet on a middle ground to make the relationship work because they're more as people than just light or dark. It's an excellent pairing for teenage relationships, for coming-of-age fics and for representing the difficulties of coming to terms with your sexuality. There's a never ending source of potential difficulties and conflicts to create and overcome, and they're great for everything from fluffy and/or smutty one-shots to angst and/or romance filled novel-length epics.

Pairings I hate are actually really hard. I'm a huge multishipper and I'm willing to read anything as long as the pairing makes sense within the story. I think the only ships that would make me go "No! Not reading it! NO!" are the /really/ weird ones like Hagrid/Dobby. To be honest, I find Hagrid's parents a pairing that I dislike. Hagrid's a great character but I don't actually understand how a human had sex with a giant. It just doesn't seem doable.

*Harry/Susan can be good as long as its written will.

*Harry/Hermione is good as long as the characters aren't made to be madly in love out of the blue. Who cares if you've known each other for that long, just starting having the feelings doesn't make you wanna get married in a day.

I hate all pairings that are slash, with the exception of the story being written well and the slash happening mostly behind the scenes. Except for Harry/Voldemort. I never read those. He murdered your parents, you just don't do that.

** 1. Harry/Voldemort; Because I like seeing a darker Harry, and a lighter Voldemort.

2. Harry/Hermione; Because they bring out the best in each other AND WHY ISN'T THIS CANON?

3.Harry/Draco; Again, darker Harry, and Draco is better for it.

(Harry/Tonks is another favorite...)

I hate Harry/Ginny and Hermione/Ron. Canon is the bane of my existence.

***** I respect that. If a person read through my fanfiction favorties they would freak out at all the random pairings I read....

I like every ship in certain aspects. I can like Snarry if It isn't a full on sex scene and kissing. (You /cannot/ unread that!) I can like Voldemort/Harry if it is a Time-Travel and Harry ends up dating Voldemort as Tom Riddle and making Tom good. (Actually have read one of those, it was awesome.)

But if the story is just twisted itself...I shut my browser, open a new one, clear my history, and turn off the computer. (I do this at least 2 times a day...)

** My absolute fave is Snape/Hermione. A close second would be Lucius/Hermione. I used to read Draco/Ginny when I first started reading HP fanfic, though I wouldn't consider them a favorite. There was actually a Hermione/Voldemort story that I read that I really liked and was a total guilty pleasure. I really hate Harry/Hermione. I do not like Hermione/Lupin like at ALL.

** Top 3: /Draco and Ginny/ I will never love a pairing as much as I love this one. In my mind, they're so perfect for each other, because Ginny is a fiery, powerful, strong-willed character, who has always been living in the shadow of Harry. Draco, after the war at least, is an asshole with a redemptive side. I always feel like they're smothered when I read fics where they're paired with other people, and even in the books, their personalities complement each other perfectly. /Hermione and Charlie/ I ran into this pairing reading some random fic, and instantly fell in love. I think I like it because Charlie was such an underdeveloped character in the books, and honestly, in all the fics I've read and in the books as well, I always felt like Hermione deserved so much more than what any of the characters could give her. Charlie always seems to bring out her adventurous side, but never smothers her personality (which happens waaay to frequently for me.) I'm beginning to suspect though, I just love the way authors write Charlie. /Luna and Harry/ These are just so fucking adorable, I can't handle it. Least Favorite: /Ginny and Harry/ Rowling gave Ginny a shit ton on potential, and then killed it by making her fawn over and be totally dependent on Harry emotionally. All of these fics just kill her character. /Hermione and Draco/Almost Any Male Character/ A lot of fanfic authors love to make Hermione into this character that is weak/ needs help to function normally. They turn her into someone who is totally socially inept, and it pisses me off. They always make these fics into "I've never done this before, I'm scared." Like she is fucking twelve years old. I hate virgin fics.

** Top pairing Harry/fleur Harry/daphne greengrass

Least favorite Anything with hermione or Ginny. I prefer Harry to have a bit more edge to him and these two characters don't leave a lot of room for that.

** I like most of the cannon pairings because they are easier to write without it feeling forced and out of character. I also like Harry/Luna and parings with origional characters.

What I really can't abide is Harry/Hermione. There is nothing in the books, or their character that suggests they would make a romantic pairing. People who ship this are either illiterate or don't believe in platonic friendships between people of opposite sexes.
