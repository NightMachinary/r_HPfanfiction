I mean, Tom Riddle got away with multiple counts of murder as a teenager. If he didn't lose his rational mind completely (he still did some impressive stuff while completely batty) how would he do it? And what are his ideals?


** This is one of my favorite HP topics!

TBH, in canon I don't think he had any goals other than power and revenge even during the first war. He's a half blood and he's scary smart, so I think he KNEW blood purity is bullshit in the beginning. The purebloods were simply the best way to get what he wanted. They were rich, ruthless, and had political clout. And they might have been elitist and xenophobic, but they (probably) hated Dumbledore. From what I remember, Rowling never explicitly said what he wanted to do with that power other than eradicate muggleborns. I think he was too crazy to really want anything else at the end.

As for HOW he would have done it, one of my favorite parts is how the first war is spoken of. I think it was Sirius who said something about how you couldn't trust anyone because you never knew who was working for him or under the imperius. This sub tends to prefer Grindelwald, and while his political arc was better written, I love Voldemort's use of terror, psychological warfare, and cunning.

A post a few days ago said something about a mother being imperiused to murder her children. How could you ever hope to fight against that?! You can't just go around killing and imprisoning random citizens. And you're already upset with and wary of government figures, but again, you can't just murder or capture them because you suspect something. It's just going to create more distrust and encourage them to actually join the psycho they're accused of spying for.

The dude put a curse on the Defense position to keep future opponents from being competent enough to fight. What a sneaky bastard.

That being said, those methods are better for a small(ish) country like England. It's why Grindewald is perceived of being more competent. He had to use more aggressive methods to conquer a whole continent consisting of different governments, instead of just a single country on an island. (Not to say there's anything wrong with that. We all know being an island did nothing to keep the UK from being a global superpower.)

For that reason, I think Rowling should have kept Voldemort's ambitions to the Uk/British Isles (Does Ireland have an independent government in the wizarding world?). There's something more nefarious about it and makes him more clever. Take over England, prove his worth, and slowly gain a following in the other countries.

All of this is why sane Tom Riddle/Voldemort are my favorite fics. The Ministry of Magic is obviously incompetent and corrupt. It creates greater conflict in the reader if you can sympathize with a villain. “Yeah he's a violent, sociopathic asshole but he's not wrong.” Or maybe he wants less restrictions on magic (something I, as a librarian, can definitely get behind. Knowledge should never be policed). Or maybe he wants to fight for non-wizarding rights. Imagine if he had gathered the goblins under his banner?

*** Ireland doesn't seem to be independent. Cornelius Fudge was representing the Irish Quidditch team at the World Cup.

*** That would be really cool if Voldemort actually gathered all the goblins under him. It'd kinda be like Rimuru from the anime (That time i got reincarnated as a slime.)

** I don't think Voldemort was insane... none of his appearances from the series suggest that. He was a ruthless sadist with a god complex that eventually made him overconfident and reckless but otherwise he seems quite lucid.

** If his og followers didn't care( or know) of him being a half-blood why not run for ministry or work is way up. We saw that young Tom was charming and could be persuasive . Do try and tell me he wouldn't get anywhere.

** Yet again I must recommend linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) :). The original divergence point is that Riddle created a political party and launched a campaign instead of making Horcruxes and launching a war.

As a result, the whole political and social landscape is altered. More people are alive and have had children, including Harry's parents and all the Marauders. But blood discrimination is legally enforced; Harry, as a half-blood, isn't eligible for Hogwarts, and non-Purebloods are unable to work in government or publicly listed companies. And Riddle isn't finished there...

It incorporates some canon elements, and does it well, but it's really a whole new storyline of its own. Riddle is working to discredit Dumbledore in order to pass more legislation, this time restricting halfblood marriages so he can control the next generation (and it turns out that he actually has partially sympathetic motivations for doing that).

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

** Think a more effective Lucius Malfoy.

Additionally, Tom had access to Slughorn, which meant he could basically get any starting position he wanted, because as connections go, a letter of recommendation from Slughorn didn't just get you in the door, it slammed the gates wide open.
