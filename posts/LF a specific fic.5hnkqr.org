I'm looking for a fic I read probably 10 years ago or so. In the fic Harry didn't go to Hogwarts and was raised to kill Voldemort, the fic is set after the war has been won and Harry is living in the muggle world. Harry is looking for a roomate and Ginny becomes his roommate though they are both trying to hide the fact that they are magical from each other.

I think Sirius and Remus live together in America, Harry is some kind of living legend and he fought in the war together with Bill Weasley, Dumbledore is still alive.

Any help is appreciated, I fear it may have been taken down from FF.net

For some reason a scene I remember is Harry gets sausage grease on his jeans when Ginny calls him to be his roommate.
