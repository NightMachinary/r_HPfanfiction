What are some clever/funny ways to take down He Who Must Not be Named?

P.S. Remember, this is the fandom, so anything goes. You can preface your post by saying *AU with no horcruxes* or *AU where DEs are connected to Voldemort via Dark Mark* or something like that, and then give a suggestion for that.


** Voldemort goes to Azkaban to lure the Dementors to his side. He's about to bargain with them. At that moment, you hit him /Silencio/.

Hundreds of Dementors. And according to Rowling, Death Eaters can't cast the Patronus charm.

** The Champion's Champion does it in a pretty funny way: Ron was cursed with magical farts (which are a major part of the story). Ron accidentally farts in the potion that revives Voldemort and kills him before he can revive.

As for Clever? HPMOR's method of Obliviating him works. Anything that defeats him w/o killing him (insanity, transfiguration, Obliviating) works.

My idea:\\
It's cannon that someone transfigured into a bird eventually mentally becomes a bird. Why not do the same to Boldemort?

** Since he has not been assassinated you have to assume a few things about him and his skills.

He's probably quite fast. No one has landed a lucky shot on him as far as we know (or their spell choice was unwise) so he is likely to have great reflexes and good defensive instincts (dodges, shields, blocking with physical barriers).

We also have to assume he has ways to prevent outright treachery, since we don't know of any of his disenchanted followers trying to harm him directly. Maybe it's part of the dark mark magic, maybe his detection spells are amazing or maybe his passive legilimency is finely tuned against treachery. He has something, otherwise Snape could have just slipped him a few of the most obscure poisons he had heard of and been done with it.

So if we want some act of treachery or unknown tactic to surprise and kill him, then to be safe you'd have to use something more or less instantaneous. Muggle weapons are probably a good bet since they have less of a chance of showing up with magical detection (I think, would intent based spells pick up an IED?). I'd probably go with explosives. The only problem here is knowing where he'd show up. I'd go with headmaster's office and count on him taking Hogwarts at some point. Maybe double up i some other seats of power where his megalomania would practically demand him to sit and congratulate himself. Maybe the minister's office, site of magical rituals that we don't know about, or even wherever the head of Gringotts sits.

** I read one story a long time ago where they Obliviated Voldemort (after he had resurrected a body for himself) until he had no memory whatsoever. The ultimate plan was to kill him when Harry died (preferably from natural causes) because of the horcrux in Harry.

** Pardon my more than modest talent in writing (in a language that's not mine)

"The dark lord Voldemort, one of the most powerful wizards of the world, was in a fool mood. That annoying Potter brat had once again wormed his way out of his genius plots. He was walking through the corridors of Malfoy's Manor, the once home of one of his most faithful servant, that the dark lord had all but claimed as his own, making his way to the great hall where he had called an emergency meeting. At least one of those incompetent death eater was bound to have at least a part of responsibility on today's debacle, and the dark lord was in great need for some emotional relieve. Tonight, lord Voldemort had a thirst for blood. The atmosphere in the hall was so heavy as lord Voldemort entered the room, the death eaters here could actually feel it like a physical weight. That's when the dark lord, walking with all his dignity to his throne, radiating power like a little sun to his followers matchsticks, but probably distracted by his bottomless anger, tripped on his own robes and fell into a plot hole, never to be seen again. After a few minutes of utter confusion, his former followers began to exit the manor, all of them to shocked to say a word. The world would learn weeks later of the worst dark wizard in a century's demise, as nobody seemed to find a good way to tell such a story."

Sorry...

I'm ashamed.

  Harry had noticed a lot of things that didn't add up around him. He did something about it. When Ron left the tent during the hunt for the horcruxes, he finally manages to get the true Hermione back. With a better plan they start the hunt anew.

** You don't need to kill him. There exist ways to permanently imprison powerful wizards. Memory charms, Amortentia, Dementor exposure, Transfiguration, soul jars, curses (the lingering kind), lots of things really. He made horcruxes, that only makes him /unkillable/ not immune to mind affecting magic.

** It doesn't matter whether he had horcruxes or not. Blowing him up should always be an option. Hunting horcruxes would be so much easier without that guy bearing down your neck.

I also think splitting his souls would introduce extra vulnerabilities such that his soul could be ejected from his body and trapped using some kind of ritual.

Then there's always the proven method of detonating a tactical nuke (<20 kT) in whatever town he was residing. Collateral damages would be bad, but this guy could kill millions if he ever consolidated his power. I'd like to think that Kingsley had borrowed one from the Muggle prime minister and would use it in case the Battle of Hogwarts was lost.

2. Bellatrix sneaks into his quarters during the night and murders him, methodically laying out his organs side by side beside his now dead body.

3. Coincidentally, a nuke goes off near or right on top of where all of his horcruxes are. He's then shot by a muggle who's out for a midnight stroll. The muggle sees a snake-faced bastard who's got a snake face and shoots him with his .38 Special.
