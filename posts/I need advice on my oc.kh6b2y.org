** I like a lot of what you have so far, but it seems to me you have more of a bundle of character traits than a homogeneous union.

For example, maybe ditch the fiery character trait to lean into the dreamy one or vice versa. Or at least try to combine them wherever possible (ie. maybe she loves flying only on magical creatures and explores her more fiery side by breaking curfew to spend more time with them and to embrace her more imaginative side)

** I think the most interesting thing you've got there is that she's a muggleborn who seems to prefers muggle books and technology to magic etc. I would expand on this and put less focus on some of her more Hermione/Luna/Ginny characteristics.

*** Ok I'll try to do that then. She also aspires to become an unspeakable in the department of mysteries because she really wants to know what goes on in there. Her curiosity could be a prominent trait to display as well. Thanks for the advice! :)

**** I'd say that's a great idea, if it was me I'd go a little further (ie she wants to know what goes on in the Department of Mysteries because someone close to her used to work there until they vanished). When making characters for roleplaying, I always find it easier to do so when I have a clear motivation in mind. It also helps the gm (if you have one) to drive your characters story arc.

** The main problem OCs face is that they end up too much like the author - in this case, you. You obviously idolize Hermione, Ginny and Luna, and this influence is leaking into your OC. You can see plenty of Self-Inserts disguised as OCs in a lot of fanfic, especially in this fandom. If you want to make the OCs stand out, then what you need is to differentiate your OC from /you/.

I think the most important thing to determine for an OC are their goals and fears. The OC is going to have a different history to you, the author - the neighborhood they grew up in, family dynamics, income bracket, school life, romantic life, hobbies and interests, all of it. So how has their experiences growing up affected their goals (things they're moving /towards/) and their fears (things they're moving /away from/)? Once you can figure these out, you can better predict how the OC would act in a situation.

My OC for a different fandom, Margaret, was abused as a child. As a result, her biggest fear is confrontation, especially when she knows she can't win. Therefore, she has strong perfectionist tendencies, she's highly likely to withdraw into herself, dislikes displays of emotion and dislikes crowds. Her primary goal, on the other hand, is to prove herself to be stronger than her tormentors; this in turn exacerbates her perfectionist and control-freak tendencies, leading to self-hatred and low self-esteem whenever things go less than perfectly.

Margaret is a fairly depressing example, I know, but she's my most developed OC and I thought it might be helpful to see what I meant.

** For the liking writing and muggle fantasy, have her write a muggle fantasy book based on Hogwarts in her free time.

If you want, make the OC J.K. Rowling, but in my opinion, that trope is /very/ overused.
