I have read several prompts here, some I like others less. And I asked myself: Have any ffs been ever written? Could you link all the ffs based on the prompts written here? Thanks

** linkffn(Like a Red Headed Stepchild) was written by a prompt here, basically, what if Harry has red hair like his mum.

I think, /I'm not sure/, that linkffn(Breaking Down the Shyness) was inspired by a prompt here, as what if Daphne was really just a shy girl behind her Ice Queen mask.

I'm pretty sure there a few more, but I can't remember right now.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

#+begin_quote
  Daphne Greengrass is known for her Ice Queen persona. But what if that is only a mask for the shy girl who dreams of adventure and romance? Unbeknownst to her, a brief interaction with Harry Potter will set her on a path that she could never have predicted. Harry for his part will find an enigma in the Ice Queen, one that for some reason, he is eager to unravel.

** My HP prompt-inspired collection is here: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13074357/1/Not-Quite-What-You-Meant]]

Most are oneshots. I have too many longfics in progress, even though I could (and would love to) expand any one of them (or all of them) into full sagas I just don't have the time.
