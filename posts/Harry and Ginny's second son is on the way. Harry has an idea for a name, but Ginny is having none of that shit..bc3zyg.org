Maybe she metaphorically slaps some sense into him.

Maybe she just says, uh, no, we named our first son after your father and your godfather already. I also already agreed to name any daughter we may have after your mother. You think I don't have any people important to me?

Maybe she's alarmed, but plays along until she can get some backup to knock him out and check any odd mental influences that he may have picked up on the job.

  The true story of how Harry and Ginny's kids got their names. Really, it's all Snape's fault. Crackfic oneshot.

** In my mind she simply says 'no' every time he brings it up. She lets him explain his reasoning in detail as much as he wants then simply says 'no' and goes on about her business.

The next scene would involve Harry trying to get Ron and Hermione on his side. Hermione stays quiet but raises her eyebrows and Ron just starts laughing...cue Ginny's smug expression.

*** Definitely my headcanon. Ginny spent DH running a resistance in movement in Hogwarts. Snape probably did a lot for her and the others, even if she didn't recognize it until after the fact. She also has a track record of bad names.

**** Yeah, Snape arguably saved Ginny, Neville and Luna from being brutally tortured by the Carrows. I feel that Ginny herself would respect that.
