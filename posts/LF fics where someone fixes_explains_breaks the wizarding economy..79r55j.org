The currency on its own is bad enough, although if the real-life UK managed with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C2%A3sd][£sd]] until 1971(!) I can imagine Wizarding currency can't be that much worse. That said, imagine calculating tax on a price in Wizarding currency without a calculator (prime number conversion rates, really?) - The Ministry has to be funded /somehow/, right?

As explained [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZkP2b-4vo][In this series of videos]], an economy based on gold and silver is problematic at best. Are there any fics exploring how on earth that even works, or replacing it with something more sane?

Bonus points if the fic centred on the goblins, and if fractional reserve banking goes horribly wrong for some amusing reason.

Of note also is the currency of Lancre in Pratchett's Discworld, which is like GSK in that it's also an intentional parody of £sd. You really should watch those videos I mentioned earlier if you haven't already, they're super educational, and might want to look at [[https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Muggles%27_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Magic/Money][This page, which covers the Magical Economy as seen in the books in more detail.]]

  In J.K. Rowling's first draft it wasn't Hagrid that found Harry Potter in Godric's Hollow, but a lowly dentist named Granger. What if he had? Harry Potter is brought before the muggle authorities, an apparent orphan. With Daniel Granger named the child's temporary guardian, he disappears into the muggle world. LittleBro!Harry, BigSis!Hermione. Not a HP/HG Ship. Canon Pairings.

** Thank you so much! I'm going to check out those videos asap as I've been having trouble getting my head around the economy.

My headcanon for the odd denominations is that the Goblins tricked humans into adopting it because they persuade them that having denominations in magical numbers is a better idea than having something easily divisible. This is a subtle middle finger at wizards and an ongoing joke on their part. Also I think that goblins must have a natural talent for mental maths.

*** Yeah, Extra History is just generally great. I'm trying to watch through their entire back catalogue, but with 178 videos in some 30-odd series it's kind of time consuming. Another thought could be that the gold standard - and thus a limited money supply - is put in place to limit the wizarding economy as part of a conspiracy on the part of the goblins in retribution for various wars and other things. It's worth noting that they've got an apparent monopoly on everything financial, and that loans either aren't a thing or they're very small. It's entirely possible that the Goblins use a completely different currency internally to avoid the supply issues for themselves, or have something else going on. Also important is where they source their food - Wizards clearly get it from Muggles, since otherwise there'd be lots of magical farmers we don't see, and goblins can't trade directly with Muggles so they have to live with buying their food using wizards as an intermediary, but they do control most of the terms of that being the only people who can exchange currencies.

edit: Actually, would a limited money supply cause deflation? If so, I'd expect to see finding capital for things being harder, since people would be less willing to spend, maybe? That'd be a decent way to sneakily sabotage a country if you literally run their economy.

**** A fixed money supply would cause money to be worth more (price deflation). If you have 100$ in the economy, and produced 100 Acid Pops, 1$ gets you 1% of your societies production, or one Acid Pop. If society get better and produces 200 Acid Pops, 1$ gets you 1% of your societies production which is 2 Acid Pop.

This does mean that if your economy is getting bigger or richer (either by more people producing the same amount or the same people producing more), the value of money goes up and the costs of goods go down. Unfortunately, this makes it a valid saving strategy to hold money under your dragon: It's value will go up, so why invest or spend? That reaction is what scares people about deflationary practices so much.

****** Kinda, like with everything to do with Economics, it is complicated.

Technically, there should be no difference between a choice of (Investments returning 12%, CD returning 4%, Savings returning 1%) and (Investments returning 10%, CD returning 2%, Savings returning -1%). If you baseline it, you are paying the same amount in lost potential earnings for relative safety.

Of course, Humans are non-rational creatures. We are loss-adverse (we do not like negative numbers. At all), so going over 0% is a pretty significant thing. Plus there is the whole 'magic number' thing. (You can read into why stocks crossing certain thresholds, ie 100$ or 1000$, have an outsizes impact on investor perception of the stock).

But the main thing to remember here is that mint owners (usually governments) have a direct impact on the last number, based on how much money they issue. The others can be harder to influence.

And while it may personally be a good decision, it is very very bad for those running the economy.

** Well the gold standard worked for a long time, although it certainly misses some of the benefits of an inflationary economy (if your unit of currency is worth less tomorrow than today, people are encouraged to spend and debt becomes cheaper)

However, I doubt you could say that the wizarding economy is the gold standard. To do so, your population has to be free to redeem(melt down) its money for gold and purchase money from gold. Without that, the coins would function much like any other non-backed currency, where they hold more value than their raw metal value due to their rarity.

That being said, I recall one fic where Hermione funded her adventures by buying gallons, melting them down, selling them to muggles, and then buying more gallons. I thought that was a fun idea.

** Sympathetic Properties doesn't have it in the story, but the fact it happened in the past is an important plot point. The Sorcerers Stone is an internationally regulated magical artifact because at one point it was used to crash the wizarding economy. They use this to bring the international community into messing with Britain's domestic politics. Also, great story: linkffn(10914042)

I think there are quite a few fics involving melting wizarding currency and selling it to Muggles. However, they usually don't involve crashing the economy, and are used as a plot device to give the protagonists lots of money. One that is memorable involved Hermione returning to the past, so you might infer that this was a problem in her prior timeline which is how she knows about the problem. linkffn(11453335)
