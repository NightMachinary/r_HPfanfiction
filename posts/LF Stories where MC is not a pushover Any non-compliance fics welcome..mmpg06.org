Any length, site or quality (if better than My Immortal, at least) can apply. How extreme (or mild) the response is is likewise irrelevant.

Shipping fics should be marked as such, however.

(In a romance fic, plot drives the relationship. In a shipping fic, relationship drives plot. If there are multiple chapters of characters being lovey-dovey and not much else happening, please warn me.)

*** Sort of. For a generally well-written fic with a sensible plot, the characterisation is /really/ off in places. Here's my "favourite" passage. (Original text quoted, interspersed with my sarcastic comments.)

#+begin_quote
  So softly that Hermione and Ron had to strain to hear it, Harry said, "I didn't fight /him/ for this. I fought and defeated /him/ so my friends could enjoy life, but I [did] /not/ do it for something like this."
#+end_quote

"Yeah, mate, it was great how you did that all by yourself," Ron agreed. "I mean, /I/ had Voldemort after me personally, while /you/ could have just sat out the whole thing by virtue of your blood status, yet you chose to fight."

#+begin_quote
  "Harry," Hermione called sadly, "even though we all know it's a power-grab, it's the law now. We don't have a choice."
#+end_quote

"Remember how Buckbeak was sentenced to be executed despite my best efforts at legal defence? We had no choice but to obey the law and let it happen. And, the first thing I did when I found out about Sirius was report him to the Aurors and describe his animagus form. And then, remember how I found out about House-Elves and their enslavement? I didn't like it at all, but it was the law, so I did nothing. Oh, and then there was our fifth year, when Ministry passed all those educational decrees. We had no choice but to disband DA immediately. As recently as last year, when Umbridge started up the Muggle-Born Registration Commission, I had no choice but to dutifully report in," Hermione continued. "The law is sacred."

#+begin_quote
  He continued to hold his girlfriend tightly and rock her gently. "An unjust law is no law at all."
#+end_quote

"Wow, Harry, you are exactly the sort of person who would read [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lex_iniusta_non_est_lex][St. Augustine]] or Martin Luther King Jr. and casually quote them in a conversation," Hermione added.

#+begin_quote
  "Harry..."

  "Hermione, not now. I need to think." He closed his eyes to concentrate better, and to hide what he really felt.
#+end_quote

"Excellent!" Hermione agreed. "I am ever so glad that I don't have to do any thinking or planning ahead! You know how much I hate doing those things and how bad I am at them, especially compared to you!"

"Indeed, I am glad I've made myself understood," Harry replied. "And I wasn't condescending about it at all."
