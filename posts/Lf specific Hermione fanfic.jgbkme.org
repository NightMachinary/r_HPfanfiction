I've searched and it's starting to bug me as I can't remember the title at all or seem to find anything that fits when I search.

Fic was on fanfiction site and I read it 3+ yrs ago

Hermione is the main character she creates a network of informants (Draco and Blaise for sure) to defeat Voldemort. There may be a time travel or seer component. Blaise refers to her as ‚ÄòDominia' or something similar at times. She pops in to Voldemort's stronghold to confront him. She attends a magic university. She's pregnant with Draco's child, she gives birth in the library during a fight when a rabble of left over death eaters try to kill her. The professor of her course is with her during the birth with Draco, Blaise and others trying to get through to get to her.

TIA


** So I thought of one story, but only parts are the same. She networks with slytherins, they call her domina, but she's in the marauder's era so it's not draco and blaise. And she gives birth to sirius' babies in a library.

  After a tumultuous Fifth Year for the Golden Trio, Dumbledore agrees to give them access to Order information. With that, Hermione is given an assignment---to be the handler for a secret faction of the Order that is comprised completely of Slytherins. This is the story of how---instead of blindly rejecting all Slytherins as a lost cause---Dumbledore went out of his way to bring them in from the dark, and how the brightest witch of her age took them to new heights. Full disclosure, I still don't know who's ending up with who. Sorry in advance.
