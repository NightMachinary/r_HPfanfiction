For example, I love fics that involve characters like Hermione and Harry meeting people (i.e., muggles) who knew them when they were younger. I'm always looking for those types of fics, but I'm starting to think that I've kind of tapped out the category.

What about you?


** I'm ambivalent about pairings for the most part, though I don't go much for slash, femslash, or teacher-student relationships (the last of which, having once been an educator, strike me as wrong on too many levels).

For themes, I prefer stories where Harry works hard and is good at magic, simply enough, whether set in Hogwarts or post-Hogwarts. I tend to dislike Harry being an angsty pushover or wimp.

Mainly, I just like stories with ambitious, unique ideas that are advanced competently. Having been reading in the fandom for nearly a decade now, I've come to respect quality writing and clever ideas above most anything else.

** My cheap answer is that I'll go for anything if it's well written and believable, or at the least clearly explained.

There is one specific thing I look for, however. I want to see Harry et al. get the crap kicked out of them. I want to see them left with scars, inside and out. I'm talking 'Game of Thrones' level of trauma. Otherwise, how will I know that they're really trying?

I'm not a masochist or anything, but there should at least be /one/ detour to the hospital wing before the epilogue.

** *Pairings*

Harry/Hermione, Sirius/Hermione, Weasley Twin/Luna, Weasley Twin/Hermione, Bill/Fleur, Neville/Ginny, Harry/Luna, Harry/Ginny

I'm not into any of the "bad" characters (Malfoy, Snape, Moldyvoldy) paired with a "good" character. I'm also not /really/ into age gaps, but the dynamic between Sirius/Hermione can be so lovely! H/Hr is my #1 ship by a landslide.

*Themes*

Time travel, dimension travel, set in the past (pre-1900), integration of muggle and magic technology (automatic reloading guns anyone? wizards in space?), Druidic magic, runic magic, blood/soul magic, wandless magic, Seer/prophecy heavy plot, familiars, Animagus transformations, other sentient species...

#+begin_quote
  Is there anything that you may recommend?
#+end_quote

Have you ever seen the Firefly tv show, or the Serenity movie based on it?

If so, and if you are a fan, then there is a crossover fic that puts Harry in their universe, and makes him a part of Malcolm's crew.

You may be thinking: that sounds completely ridiculous.

And you are right. For that reason I avoided the fic for years. And then I read it, and it was amazing. It /nailed/ the characterizations.

**** Absolutely nothing against gay people... I just haven't seen chemistry between any of the same-gender characters. I try to read fics that are fairly in-character. "Rebirth" (I forget the author) pairs Tom Riddle Jr with a male OC he grew up with in the orphanage, and it's one of my favorite fics.

**** And? In my mind, Wizards have perfect prophylactics, and birth defects are the only logical reason against incest. Other than that, if they're in love, why should anyone care? They also weren't raised close enough for the Westermarck effect to matter.

Because of the prophylactics thing, in my mind Wizards shouldn't have a taboo against cousin relationships. I know that many jokes were made in the series about pureblood inbreeding, and birth defects, but that doesn't mean they view the act in and of itself as wrong.

****** Personal opinion. They are people, you're a person, why should common recent ancestors mean anything in terms of relationships? I get personally not being open to it, but if both people are happy, why do you think that no one should do it? I'd rather people not do it if it's going to tear apart their family, but it's still their choice and I won't frown upon it.

I think, for things that are generally looked down upon by society, that are social taboos, you have to look at why. Like shitting in the street is one not because the inherent act is disgusting, but because shit is agreed upon as something people don't want to be exposed to, and because of disease etc. For this type of relationship, the taboo focuses on the relationship itself, that there's something /wrong/ with it in and of itself, not because of how it affects others. So if the people in the relationship are happy, then why should it matter? Just like if everyone who had to see and smell your shit on the sidewalk was okay with it, shit away.

People dislike relationships between family members because it's a social norm to do so. All they've ever been told or shown by others is disgust towards these types of relationships. Question everything, and analyze in an of itself whether the thing is necessary to be shunned.

** Pairings: Anything that's Harry/unconventional. I love Harry/Fleur, Harry/Tonks, those kind of fics. Also have a strange addiction to trio fics (Harry/Ron/Hermione).

Plotlines: I enjoy well written AU fics. Where Harry has been raised in a situation different from cannon. I also have this "thing" for soulbond fics (especially Sovrans work!). I really like "ambitious" Harry stories, where he strives for greatness, but those are almost always horrible if they aren't AU from the start.

More than anything, I like reading original and unique ideas. I've been into fanfiction for so long (over 11 years now, though I did take a break of about 5 years in 2007) that the fics tend to run together in my head. When I find something that stands out, it practically demands I read it.
