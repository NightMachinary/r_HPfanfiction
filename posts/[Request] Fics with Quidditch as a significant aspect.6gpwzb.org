I've noticed that a lot stories tend to downplay or eliminate Harry's quidditch playing, and so I was wondering if there were any good fics that had Quidditch as a significant story element. Thanks in advance.


** TheEndless7 probably writes some of the most detailed and well written Quidditch sequences I've ever seen, and they're always incredibly long, so you should check them out. Just pick any one of their stories, Quidditch will have a major role in it.

** There's this one Harry/Gabrielle fic that's pretty long and is focused on quidditch and his developing relationship with her, for the life of me I don't know the name though.
