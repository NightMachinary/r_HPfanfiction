Would like if some Slytherins joined as well, but that's not mandatory.

Edit: If anyone decides to write this, even if it's just a oneshot please post the fic here!


** I can't think of the name of the Fic, but I remember there was one where in the middle of umbridge's first lesson the other students just turn around and look at Harry and then most just leave the classroom. I can't remember the name of it though

** Day 9: As they walk into class Harry tosses an empty Coke bottle at Prof Umbridge and shouts, "Catch!" Reflexively, she catches and disappears as the portkey whisks her away. Harry turns around to face the class, "For today's lesson..."

Day 16: With a shouted, "/Toadius Maximus/!" Prof Umbridge was transfigured into a toad and deposited by Harry into a wastebasket for the duration of class. Hermione stood glaring with her arms crossed, "Honestly, Harry. That's not even a spell!"

Day 23: Prof Umbridge was encased in a giant, clear, soundproof box, alternating between waving her wand and trying various spells to free herself and simply pounding against the walls. The class largely ignored her as Harry lectured to the class.

Day 37: With a flash of light, Prof Umbridge disappeared via portkey. Harry chuckled, "I can't believe she's still falling for that.' Shrugging he turned to the class, "When we last left off..."

** YES! Someone write it. They all ditch Hogwarts for Hogsmead and fight back when the adults try to force 'em back. Prefects, upperclassmen, and alumni help teach those who are lacking in subjects they're knowledgeable in.

** It's a decently long read to get there but there's a truly marvelous stand against Umbridge in the ao3 series The Secret Language of Plants. I think it's in linkao3(The Meaning of Dandelions) but you should really start from the beginning because it is certainly AU.

  The stupid hat was stupid and refused to help Harry. The whole school and its division in houses was stupid too, and the teachers.Harry was in Hogwarts, but he didn't want to be. He wanted to go back home.

**** It's one of my absolute favorites. The Gringotts chapter is one of the best pick me ups ever. And the notes that the author sprinkles throughout telling you that this is a good stopping point and you should rest are absolutely well deserved, though generally ignored.

On that note, any of your favorites in a similar tone (being very expansive here because it's a very unique fic.). For example, the fic I most associate with it is linkffn(8197451).

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.
