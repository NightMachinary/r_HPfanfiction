Saw it mentioned in the ideal pair thread, but send us your Battle Couples fics ie the main couple go out and be equally badass together, instead of "hero and the arm candy" that we so often see.


** This theme is highly popular in AU H/G fics:

"Abraxas", linkffn(11580650)

"Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always", linkffn(4101650)

"Children's Crusade", linkffn(6989327)

"Elemental Harry", linkffn(5648259)

"Gothic", linkffn(11922116)

"Hail Odysseus", linkffn(10645463)

"Harry Potter and Godric's Legacy", linkffn(5270746)

"My Slytherin Harry", linkffn(6160345)

"The Bonds of Blood", linkffn(5435295)

"Unspeakable Things", linkffn(6473434)

--------------

But somehow less so in H/Hr fics:

"Harry Potter and the Spy Girl", linkffn(10959290)

"Heart and Soul" by Philosophize, linkffn(11761312)

"Resistance", linkffn(2746577)

"Stages of Hope", linkffn(6892925)

"The Stars Alone", linkffn(12040341)

"Uncle Quentin's Spy", linkffn(11102515)

--------------

All the above fics have the main couple going out and killing large amount of their enemies. The targets are usually Death Eaters, but "Abraxas" and "The Stars Alone" have different enemies. The body counts in those two stories are also astronomical.

  Her father had told Harry that if Hermione was in danger he should hold that box in front of her and push the button. He'd never have expected that a series of flashing lights would transform Hermione into "Spygirl". Fortunately, the dozen Death Eaters facing them hadn't expected that either. Harry Potter/Spyboy crossover.

**** I was thinking of the scene where Ron and Hermione infiltrated the Ministry by playing up their stereotypes- Hermione as a gutless bookworm and Ron as an arrogant playboy who's 'dating' her for her brains- and proceeded to execute their individual parts of the plan perfectly. Also all the snogging in surveillance vans in the last book. It's such a great fanfic.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  New Mexico was not the first time Thor had been a mortal. It was only a refinement of the technique. What if James Potter had been Thor, incarnated as a memoryless newborn? On his death, Odin removed his memories as James, due to grief. In Harry's Third Year, a (mostly) reformed Loki restores them. Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.

** There's a bit of this in copperbadge's linkao3(Cartographer's Craft by copperbadge)--the crypt scene that's fairly early on comes particularly to mind. Harry/Sirius, interesting implementation of time travel, though they're not yet a couple as of that scene. There's more later in the fic where they are together!
