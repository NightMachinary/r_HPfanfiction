I love time travel fics, but honestly I think I've read most of the "good" ones on ff.net or at least the ones that are relatively similar to my taste. I mostly stick to canon pairings, and I tend to have a hard time suspending my disbelief in fics in which either Draco or Snape is a romantic lead.

I would be happy to recommend my favorites, but honestly I"m trying to find new material.

Any favorite time travel fics (preferably canon pairings if any) that aren't on ff.net?


** I havent read fics in a while but i always loved time travel ones... care to share your favs? or ff.net username so i can check your favs? Thanks

*** I don't have time to post a full list now (though if you send me a message later to remind me, I can cobble something together for you. My all-time favorite is Backwards with a Purpose, and Flame to Spark is somewhat underrated in my opinion. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanficRecs/HarryPotterPeggySue][TV tropes]] has a good list.
