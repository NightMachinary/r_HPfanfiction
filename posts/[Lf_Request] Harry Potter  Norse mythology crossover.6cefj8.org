** You might like [[http://ficwad.com/story/76962][Harry Potter and the Midnight Sun by Vanir]]. It's primarily a Harry/Gabrielle/mythical hotties harem crackfic with frequent references to Norse mythology. NSFW and proud of it.

*** Yeah if you want Norse Mythology this is probably the closest you're gonna get, OP. If you don't mind NSFW and how crackish it gets, it's actually a fun read.

** You might try linkffn(10216252), I'm getting through it slowly at the moment, hoping it will diverge a bit more from canon.

  In his several millennia of existence Loki Odinson, God of Mischief and Lies, had been many things; he had been a liar, a warrior, and a trickster, just to name a few, but never before had he been a loving father, he'd never been given the chance. However, the moment the tiny creature was in his arms, he knew he would do anything necessary to keep hold of what was his.

** linkffn(Transliterations) The author had taken it down, but some dude put up what he had, saying that it was until the author contacted him.

Crosses over to Marvel universe, but stays almost completely in Asgard, during their past. Harry arrives before the war with Jutonheim, so quite a while chronologically. It also goes into lore and myth pretty heavily.

  He had attained the rights to be the Master of Death, and it was his obligation to steer the fates away from destruction whilst she reaped the souls to fuel Life. (Rewrite of Rewrite. Pun intended.) Re-posting of ikkiichiyuu's original fic.

** Another HP/Avengers, but linkffn(To Ride Upon Svadilfari) focuses pretty heavily on the Norse mythology side.

  The world is breaking. War and technology push on the edge of the unbelievable as S.H.I.E.L.D. desperately tries to keep the peace. Soldier and scientist no longer hold the line alone, as an ancient fire burns alongside them. The last of all wizards.
