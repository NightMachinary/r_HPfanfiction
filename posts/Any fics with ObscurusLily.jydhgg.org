Petunia's bullying causes Lily to suppress her magic so she becomes an obscurus. This is revealed when a brutal fight with Petunia causes her to lose control of her magic, accidentally killing her parents. Dumbledore and (both sides of) the ministry realise that Lily could be a weapon in the brewing war (Grindelwald wanted obscuri after all) so take her into care, help her control her magic, educate her at hogwarts when she turns eleven as planned, etc. but keep the fact that she's an obscurus a secret.\\
We see Lily's years at Hogwarts, interacting with the Maurauders, exceptionally powerful at magic, anger management for fear of the obscurus taking over, avoiding all talk about her home life, coping with her deep dark secret, thinking she's a murderer, etc. And an argument with James causes her to lose control again and almost kill him with dark magic.

Is there any fics with an Obscurus!Lily of even a Lily whoâ€˜s accidental magic gets out of control when she's younger and someone gets hurt? If not, can someone please, PLEASE write one.


** Haven't read it, but linkffn(Obscurial Flower) has an Obscurial!Lily. I do not know what ships if any it features.

  An AU where Lily Evans doesn't end up going to Hogwarts or a Magical school to learn how to use her magic. Instead she grows up raised as a muggle not knowing she is a witch. Her life will involve some close calls, terrible misfortunes and a time traveling dimension jump to learn of how her life could have gone. How will this version of Lily deal while becoming an Obscurial?
