As in no canon characters, and if there are any they'd be very much background characters. Would you like that or is that not your cup of tea? Just curious :)


** Depends on the subject. Exploring different magic without warping canon character into something they're not? Yes.

Stories about unsung heroes in any of the wars?

Obscurial recovery fic with found family fic with some poor muggle out of their depth?

OC werewolf who was raised solely in the wizarding world out in the muggle world by choice doing their best

There are a lot of interesting situations that don't need canon characters or canon characters can't fulfill.

Muggleborn animagus being petty to their muggle neighbor.

Muggleborn support group.

Families of muggleborns support group. Hey Hermiones Parents

Squibs doing important magical research.

It'd be a hard sell and tagging it so people can find and read it would be a nightmare. It'd probably have to be its own like category. Like...Harry Potter Original Works or something.

*** What if it's a whole new plot? Like it has the same setting (Hogwarts) and some of the same characters (teachers mostly), but it's set around now and it has a different conflict and everything. Would that be of interest to you or anyone else?

But thanks for the examples, they're really great ideas. Good prompts for sure :)

**** Like I said it all depends on the plot. It depends on the characters. It depends on the author. It would be interesting and fun at the least.

**** At some point I do have to /wonder/ why you'd use one thing and not another.

As an example, if you're using Hogwarts as a location but never using the canon staff, that's a bit strange - either you might as well go full OC-magic-school, or you should probably use the canon characters in the background /somewhere/ if there's no logical reason for them to have disappeared.

***** I guess there's no real reason for it, maybe I should just use a whole new school. The only thing is, then the story loses the last bit of familiarity of Hogwarts, you know?

I probably will have some canon characters be mentioned, but I'm not a huge fan of The Cursed Child characters, and my story would be set around then.

****** You could absolutely go the Alexandra Quick route with it.

Nothing wrong with a fanfic that only uses the barest skeleton idea of the works it's based on.

That said, if you /have/ a reason to use Hogwarts, you should probably include the characters that'd logically be there in /some/ way or another - even if it's in the same capacity that Daphne Greengrass exists in canon.

Also, you can safely disregard Cursed Child in the opinion of most fanfic writers/readers, the epilogue is more up-in-the-air.

**** I've always found this sort of thing interesting. It's a great way to flesh out a world without getting into battles about character attributes. I like to see stuff in the style of the ST TNG episode “below decks”, where you see how regular citizens are dealing with major events.

** While I don't mind fics that feature OCs, I would personally not read a fic that has /only/ OCs. I mean, I read HP fics for a reason -- watching various HP characters in interesting situations. I consider the HP characters far more important than the HP universe. Basically, I would rather read a bunch of HP characters being stuck in the universe of Star Wars somehow, rather than a group of Star Wars characters being stuck in the universe of Harry Potter (I don't read SW fanfics).

** Why not just make an original story rather than shackling yourself to the broken potterverse? Most of the reason I read fanfics is for the characters

** I read and enjoyed Alexandra Quick, and that has practically none of the canon HP characters make an appearance by virtue of being set in America (and since the fic started pre-Fantastic Beasts, it's not even Ilvermorny): linkao3(16927533)

A Harry Potter fanfic, to me, needs to consist of one of the following:

- Canon Characters.
- Canon Setting/Mechanical feel.

You can absolutely make a fanfic with none of the same characters, set in an OC magic school, and still have it count as a Harry Potter fanfic.

** OCs are fine, but honestly the HP world is so slapdash that if you're going to use all OCs you can just file the numbers off slightly and write your own YA magical school book and probably come out better.

** It's what I write. And very much what I like to read. Because I like the setting, but feel bored by the characters of the trio. Not because they're bad characters, but because of simple overexposure; we know them too well

I have Harry as strictly an unseen character although he's widely gossiped about. Ron and Hermione have a brief amount of screen time, with a couple of lines each. I focus on the students in two years above the trio so I've got some canon characters to play with - the Twins, Cedric Diggory, Angelina Johnson - but so I've essentially had to compose an entire student body for that year, some purely inventions, some fleshings-out of canon characters of which little other than name is known.
