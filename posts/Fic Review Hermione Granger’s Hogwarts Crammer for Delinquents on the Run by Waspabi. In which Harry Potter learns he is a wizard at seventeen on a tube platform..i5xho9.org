  :CUSTOM_ID: premise
  :END:
Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run was based on [[https://heythisisbecky.tumblr.com/post/91905068086/do-you-ever-wonder-what-would-have-happened-if-the][this Tumblr prompt]]. It is an AU set during the Deathly Hallows, in which Harry never received his Hogwarts letter because the Dursleys moved around a lot and the ministry lost track of him for several years. He is now a seventeen-year-old runaway and barely eking out an existence in London, completely unaware of his magical background. That is, until Hermione and her band of misfits accost him on the tube platform one day, barely in time to rescue him from two death eaters who have tracked him down at the same time. From here, they go on the run, trying to bring Harry up to speed on being the Boy Who Lived and a wizard whilst outrunning Voldemort's regime.

It clocks in at 93k words and was written over 10 months between 2016-2017. It's an M rating, but to be on the safe side I will not link the fic directly as it arguably violates rule 8 of this subreddit. Specifically there is a small amount of non-explicit, consensual sexual activity between seventeen-year-olds.

As a bit of meta, this is a /very/ popular story. It has 25k kudos on AO3. It has fanfiction and fanart of its own. The author has a small [[https://waspabi.tumblr.com/tagged/hermione%20granger's%20hogwarts%20crammer%20for%20delinquents%20on%20the%20run][Tumblr page]] dedicated to it. Someone has even gone to the trouble of recording a 9-and-a-half-hour long podfic reading of it. (I'm getting really into podfics these days btw - please recommend some to me.) This story has obviously made an impression on many, many fans.

* Writing
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: writing
  :END:
Waspabi is an /excellent/ writer - Hogwarts Crammer is an incredibly moreish read. I started the fic back in May then hit a dead spot in the Harry Potter fandom for a little while there, but I picked it back up again only a few days ago and binged most of it in one night.

There is a heavy emphasis on character and setting, both of which are done with care, detail and skill. I'd place money that they are a British writer, because there were British references laden throughout the story in the form of slang, pop culture, local brands, sports teams and a fairly solid knowledge of accent and geography. Reading this, I absolutely believe that Harry knows the streets of London and its rougher neighbourhoods -- it's extremely immersive. Not to mention the humour is as British as everything else and gives the story a lighter atmosphere. I mean, the fic's opening line gives you a fairly good idea of what you're in for:

​

  Draco Malfoy's shiny dragon-leather oxford sunk four inches into the largest, most excessive dog dropping he had ever seen.
#+end_quote

​

The story is told in past tense 3rd person limited, with Harry, Hermione and Draco as the POV characters. They have easily distinguishable ‘voices' in their narratives as well as their actual dialogue, which are both fitting for their characters and enjoyable to read. The chapters themselves are very chunky -- about 11k words per chapter and only 8 chapters in all. Having it broken down to be a bit more bite-sized might have made it easier to pace, and that's about my only criticism with the technical side of it.

* Plot
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: plot
  :END:
The story shadows Deathly Hallows in that most of it is set whilst the band of runaways camps in the woods in their magical tent. However it is not only Ron and Hermione who have set off to find their alternate-universe-best-friend Harry Potter, but the silver trio and Draco Malfoy have also come along for the journey.

In another fic I once reviewed, Quirrel stole blood from Harry Potter in a corridor in Hogwarts one day and was able to resurrect Voldemort using that. A similar occurrence in this fic involves Pettigrew managing to track Harry down in London but then letting him go, a mistake for which he pays with his life. Thus without Harry's knowledge, the Dark Lord has risen in wizarding Britain and is trying to find and eliminate his prophesied equal. The AU is well put together in the way it thinks out but does not slap you in the face with how things are different in this universe and why. A lot more people are dead in this timeline, and I'll get into that a bit more as I talk about the characters.

If you were the type of fan who got frustrated with how much of Deathly Hallows was spent camping in the woods and trying not to die rather than moving in on taking down Voldemort, you are likely to find the same frustrations with this story. Since we are dealing with a bunch of runaway teenagers whose main goal (to find Harry Potter before Voldemort did) is accomplished within the first chapter, there is a sense of the story meandering around a couple of larger events rather than following a plot.

The author keeps on baiting the whole ‘curse on the name' thing going on with Voldemort, when more than half a dozen times Harry nearly says the full name then stops himself, but no one actually triggers the curse once throughout the story, even though they don't know that they shouldn't.

Since Harry only learns who Voldemort is and what he did to Harry's family through the course of the story at seventeen, he hasn't had that build up of fear, tension and hatred that leads Harry into becoming the saviour of the wizarding world in canon. In fact, it feels more like he's getting dragged into saving a world he didn't know existed a few weeks ago and has no investment in. By the end of the story, the group has joined forces with the Order of the Phoenix, but none of the external conflicts have been resolved, Voldemort is still alive and his power undiminished, and Harry hasn't even really decided if he's going to be the one to take him down. It ends up feeling a bit like the story hasn't really gone anywhere or accomplished anything.

When asked on their Tumblr about the possibility of a sequel, the author answered this:

​

#+begin_quote
  hogwarts crammer was always intended to have an open ending as i am negative two billion percent interested in redoing horcruxes. the real plot of crammer was the emotional arcs of our heroes and hopefully you felt some resolution there.
#+end_quote

In support of what the author has said, I can confirm that although I would have liked a longer fic with a more closed ending, everything I just mentioned above didn't really bother me throughout my reading experience, because the character moments really are the bread and butter of this story.

* Characterisation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: characterisation
  :END:
The author has taken a bit of meta discussion about Harry Potter and diversity into account when they wrote this. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermione_Granger#Theatre_portrayal][Hermione is written as black]] and Harry is [[https://www.mugglenet.com/2017/10/mind-harry-potter-indian/][of Indian descent]], though neither of these changes play heavily into the plot.

Hermione very much has her canon personality -- she's the leader of the group, highly strung, and by far the most prepared character in the history of perhaps ever. She has already gotten together with Ron in this universe and they share a room in the tent they travel around in. She's stubborn but gets discouraged when no one appreciates her efforts and is just a bit too overbearing for some of the others at times. Mostly I'm impressed that she held everyone together in such an uncertain adventure and didn't end up having a nervous breakdown with all the pressure.

Ron is much more chill than in canon; usually the one who calms Hermione down, negotiates the different opinions in the group and cracks the occasional joke. This could just be a choice by the author to keep him from causing too much drama since he's mostly a side character, though personally I took 2 things away from this characterisation:

1. Sans having grown up as Harry Potter's best friend, Ron's inferiority complex is nowhere near as crippling and makes him a more well-rounded man by seventeen.

2. Some part of me has to assume that this is just Ron's natural state when he's regularly getting laid. *shrug*

Either way, I buy it.

What I love about the way *Harry* is written is that even though he should be the most different to his canon personality of all the characters he not only feels recognisable as Harry Potter, he is also still a very sympathetic character. He is understandably a bit rougher, but he really comes across as a seventeen-year-old. And not the way seventeen-year-olds imagine themselves, but like an actual immature teenager whose emotional expression has all the grace and poise of a [[https://images.app.goo.gl/nBNb4DHWBV9Pxec96][horse on an exercise ball]]. He acts instinctively, he's compassionate but standoffish since he's never been shown real affection before, his temper gets the better of him sometimes, and despite being out of his element he will stand up for himself to anyone. He also has some of canon Harry's sass, which I love to see.

*Ginny* is also a background character, mostly characterised by her being brash and the biggest Gryffindor in the room. When the group discusses what actions they should try to take against the Death Eaters, Ginny is unreservedly in favour of murdering as many of them as possible. It feels like this unnervingly violent Ginny is mostly played for laughs, which I was giving the side-eye to a bit, until I realised something. In this universe, Harry wasn't around to warn Dumbledore about Arthur Weasley in the Department of Mysteries, so he died of his injuries two years previously. Even though it's never stated explicitly, I understood that Ginny's violent tendencies aren't just a comedic quirk, but a way to show how Ginny is processing the murder of her father through rage.

*Neville* and *Luna* are written kind of as male and female versions of each other -- these two background characters who seem like they stumbled on this journey more or less by accident. One is happy to talk about plants all day, the other about conspiracies. If I'm completely honest, I don't think much of the plot would have been changed if everyone aside from the three POV characters had been dropped entirely, and I feel like they were mostly written in for nostalgia's sake.

Which brings me to *Draco*. Waspabi has done perhaps my favourite characterisation of Draco -- the spoiled, self-preserving drama queen. He is almost certainly inspired by Maya's Draco -- [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Maya_(fan_writer][Maya]]) who has written some of my favourite HP fanfiction of all time but sadly dropped off the internet in order to become a published author. I reviewed one of Maya's stories last year and I think the reasoning I used then for why this version of Draco works so well applies here: he is consistent enough with his canon personality to be believable whilst being just different enough to be likeable.

In this story, Draco has fled his father and the Death Eaters to join Hermione on her mission to find Harry. The tipping point -- the push that would make Draco make this decision is one that I'm starting to notice a pattern of -- Narcissa Malfoy is killed by Voldemort. Fanfic authors seem to agree that harming Draco's mother specifically might be the only thing that would spur Draco into risking his life to support Harry, as Draco is neither motivated by righteousness nor particularly brave. I like fics which can make Slytherin characters sympathetic without erasing the characteristics which make them Slytherin or undoing/whitewashing the awful things they do. This fic really hits the sweet spot there, and Draco is probably my favourite character to read.

If you read the tags you'll know that this is a Drarry story, and perhaps the only one I've read in which their relationship is completely without the baggage of their rivalry from Hogwarts. There's no gay panic element to it either because both boys have already worked out their sexuality, so for a Drarry fic it's a surprisingly uncomplicated love story. I found it cute, clumsy, very endearing and probably my favourite parts of the story, which I think was the intention.

* TL:DR
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: tldr
  :END:
I /highly/ recommend this story, for teens and up. It has been a minute and I can't remember who recommended this fic for me, but it was brilliant and thank you so much for it. It's a beautiful AU, hopeful despite the grimness of the wizarding world without Harry Potter, and a real feel-good read. I'm finding myself in greater need of these kinds of stories these days, as COVID-19 carries on and the outside world seems bleaker than ever. What it lacks in plot it makes up for in character development and heart. I'd give this one an 8/10.

** I'm curious that it's the only Drarry story you've read that doesn't have the baggage of their Hogwarts rivalry, because it means you haven't read the extremely comparable linkao3(Life skills outside the curriculum by Endrina), which has a similar premise (in fact I can never which is which). While this one, the Crammer, is better written in several ways, I think I do probably prefer the other, for reasons you've mentioned here. All the time spent idling in the forest, the fairly unnecessary extra characters who joined them, the way it stops before getting into much plot... I think it ultimately feels a bit unsatisfying

*** It definitely does mean that I have not read Endrina's work, and if the premise is as similar as you say then it's possible that they were both inspired by the same prompt. If there's a version of this story which you feel wraps up even better I'd be happy to give that a go. Do you think it's worth adding to my review list? If not I'm happy to give it a read anyhow - thank you for the recommendation!

**** Quite possibly the same prompt, since they were posted at pretty much the same time. Admittedly it doesn't wrap things up well per se; it ends in a similar way, actually, then has an explanatory epilogue. But I think the earlier part of Life Skills feels more like a complete story arc of Harry (and Draco) getting to that point, whereas the Crammer feels more like it is just the start of the story.

Definitely worth reading. I'm not sure if you'd like to review it or not

** It's probably a matter of taste, but to be honest, I found it a bit underwhelming given the amount of praise I'd seen for it. It's not really satisfying on a plot level because of the way it cuts off, and what makes Harry/Draco interesting to me /is/ their existing canon tension, so without that, it's just sort of "teen finds out he's a magical chosen one, reacts warily, meets a boy he likes, the end." Harry's relationships with the adults from canon might have been interesting, but we don't really see that either, if I remember correctly. It's readable, but it didn't really do much for me.

The Drarry canon tension is definitely one of the most fun things about the ship, so I can also understand its absence not being a point in the fic's favour, though it was surprisingly enjoyable to me nonetheless.

Cassandra Claire said something similar when she was about to wrap up her fandom presence and publish The Mortal Instruments series, but in both cases the authors actually compiled the PDFs of their works themselves and put them up publicly for a period of time first, for the express purpose of fans being able to download them and continue to read and enjoy them after they stopped being hosted under the author's pseudonyms.

For the sake of Maya's privacy though, I've deliberately not mentioned her real/published name, so as not to link her to her fanfiction and muddy those legal waters, which are the whole reason her fanfiction had to come down in the first place.

****** I hope my comment didn't sound critical of you! I loved your review and have just been on your site reading your review of Drop Dead Gorgeous which is another of my favourites. (Though as far as I remember, maya didn't actually post the pdf anywhere. We had to email and ask for it, and she asked everyone not to share it any further. Though she may have posted it publicly at a different time - it was a long time ago and I took.a fandom break not long after that!) And I realise that it's been shared widely already and the work is already floating around out there!

******* Not at all - it's a fair point to make. And strictly yes, I probably should just never mention that a fanfic author named Maya existed and certainly not link to work that she took down, but this is also the internet, as you said. Once it's out in the wild it's never truly inaccessible again, and you can no more eliminate the evidence of it than a published author could unpublish themselves. I guess I use that excuse somewhat because I think it's a real shame that her work had to come down at all.

*** There's a thread further up talking about this. If you really want to know then I'm sure it's posted on the internet somewhere, but in order to justify sharing her fanworks I won't associate her with her published name here.

** The review is really great, but it buried the lede about being a Drarry foc really thoroughly. I was frustrated to discover that tidbit after I was letting myself get interested in the fic.

*** Then I'm sorry to hear that with everything else going on for the story that Drarry would make it a deal breaker for you. The Drarry part certainly wasn't intentionally 'buried', it's just not something I blared out at the top of the post because I didn't think it warranted a trigger warning.

*** In the second paragraph I address why I haven't added it. However as you can see, the fic has a very distinctive name, so its only a very short Google search away if you'd like to read it.
