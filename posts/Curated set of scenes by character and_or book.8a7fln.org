Especially for characters with relatively less screen time, like Lavender Brown, Alicia Spinnet, Dean Thomas, Terry Boot, etc

Would also be helpful if there was something like that for the other main characters, like Albus Dumbledore.

Writing a story and I'm doing this manually and taking notes, but considering the fandom is so large, I wouldn't be surprised if somebody else has already done this. Trying to avoid reinventing the wheel here. Like that person who cataloged Harry's abuse, lmao.
