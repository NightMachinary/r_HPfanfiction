So I was just thinking about this -- has anyone ever thought/found a fanfic where the Marauder's Map could be a Horcrux for Sirius/James/Remus/Peter? I mean, it shares a lot of similarities with the diary (created as a student, responds to questions), and if you change the background so Snape dies under the Willow, it's a perfect setting.


** I did read a fic once where either James or Sirius came back from the map, because it had absorbed part of his soul.

I can't remember the name though.

*** Sounds like linkao3(Cartographer's Craft).

Sirius is the one who comes back.

***** Well that was useful...

Copy&Pasted Summary:

In the summer after Harry's sixth year, Harry and Remus uncover a section of the Marauder's Map which has been hidden for the past twenty years, releasing a carbon copy of sixteen-year-old Sirius Black from its depths. As they prepare for the impending war, Sirius must find a place for himself in this new world, Harry must find a way to destroy Voldemort, and Remus must face his own past while trying to build a tenuous future with Tonks.

******* A pull request was merged that fixes the bug. Fun fact: tusing must habe read explcit or mature content before as he obviously did not encounter the "are you old enough" question.

** I point you to Warrior's Heir by Osireia, a superb fanfic in which Harry is thrown into an alternate dimension where he is a Dark Lord and Tom Riddle is the Boy-Who-Lived. It works particularly well, as Dark-Lord-Harry is close enough to his canon self that you begin to root for him. Without wishing to spoil, Harry makes a horcrux out of the Marauder's Map, which possesses someone when they use it too much.

Now, let me see if I understand this new-fangled "FanfictionBot" thing... er, linkffn(Warrior's Heir) ?

  DEAD. Harry is thrown into a world where purebloods are condemned, Tom Riddle is the Boy Who Lived, and the Dark Lord is someone he'd never suspect. Will his emerging abilities be enough? Should he support Riddle - or the Dark Lord? No slash.

** I read a fic where they got drunk and made it a horcrux, and then Lily secretly does it too once they pass out. +I forget which one+ [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4220317/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Marauders-Horcrux][found it]], but it was linked somewhere on this reddit. It was such a cop-out, though, they all killed spiders to make it. Like, really? =__= Just think of the moral issues raised if the marauders committed the same sin Voldemort did, the one people react to such shock and horror and disbelief with in canon and almost every fanfic ever. I had fun rewriting a version for my own satisfaction where they actually did it properly =D but of course it's not up anywhere, since just rewriting a fanfic is probably considered plagiarism or something.

*** I doubt you can make a horcrux by killing a spider. I think it works kind like equivalent exchange, it has to be murder.

**** Are you into FMA? <3 and I totally agree with you, killing a spider to make a horcrux is just bull. I think it's more likely that they justify it to themselves as "this death eater scum wants to hurt people like my Lily-flower, so it's not wrong to kill them before they can hurt us". Of course, that only works well when they're too wasted to think about it too hard.
