******* Everyone dance around why George is a buzzkill, but Harry is blunt as hell. He got tried of George bs and slaps him across the face and told him that Fred is disappointed (my headcanon is Harry can talk with ghost) in him and pull his head out of his ass and make more than enough chaos for the both of them

******** To be honest, I see Ginny being the one to pull him out of it. She's more straightforward than Harry. Harry's too awkward

***** I'd say Charlie but they'd see him like 5 times. Even if he shows them dragons, that's not enough to become the favorite. It's enough to joke and say he's the fav tho...but I don't think he'd be the fav. He has dragon children to care for though so as long as he's the dragons fav, he won't care

***** I believe Charlie would be a great uncle. While Percy would be the stick in the mud uncle. Hence the plot twist
