I just read Across the Universe by Mira Mirth. Are their any more pics out their with a Harry like that? He's a kid who went through war and he's just sort of surviving.


** First, pretty sure you meant "fics" not "pics".

Second, some recs (I assume you're looking for fics where war has had a major effect on Harry?):

linkffn(Past's Player by the Fictionist)

linkffn(Solace in Shadows by the Fictionist)

linkao3(C'est la Vie by cywscross)

linkffn(Imprisoned Realm by LoveHP)

linkffn(Their Verdict of Vagaries by Angstier) (Slash alert on this one)

linkffn(Timely Errors by Worfe)

Also, Mira Mirth's main fic has a similar vibe. linkffn(On the Way to Greatness by mira mirth). IMO OTWTG's Harry has always been trying to survive, right from the start.

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

#+begin_quote
  When Harry is kidnapped by a seemingly sixteen year old Tom Riddle at the end of his second year, he's convinced that he would do absolutely anything to escape -- but "anything" can be a dangerous conviction to have, and even heroes can grow tired of fighting without hope. Sometimes, survival means making a home in the dark... Warning: Deals with Stockholm Syndrome and dark themes.
