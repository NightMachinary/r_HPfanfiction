Like the title says im looking for a fic where harry has a easy, happy and normalish life at hogwarts. Preferably without voldemort or without him being a major threat. Thanks in advance to any suggestions!

  Taylor Hebert, Skitter, Weaver, Khepri... So many names I'd gone by, so many faces. Yet somehow it was typical that, after giving that woman an answer, I'd wake up on an island filled with monsters of the past and an ethereal presence looming over me. But c'est la vie... and hey, living here was a walk in the park compared to everything else I've been through! Practically a vacation!

  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  Fate and Death owes Harry, so Fate sends him to an alternate universe to live out his childhood again. Most of it, anyway. Harry definitely didn't want to be stuck as eleven again. The reason for the change? Harry is supposed to achieve 'peace of mind.' Whatever the hell that means. WARNING: Mild swearing and non-canon character death.

** In linkffn(The Best Revenge), Harry has a good relationship with pretty much everyone and has a great time at Hogwarts. Voldemort doesn't play a big role either since it just covers first year.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!
