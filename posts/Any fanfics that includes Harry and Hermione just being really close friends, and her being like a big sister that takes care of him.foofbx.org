** I have written a few which fit this bill, ranging from a cracky response to a thread here to serious 4th year AUs centered around friendship and family and a few falling somewhere between those two.

  Hermione Granger is pregnant. Trouble is, she has not slept with a man during the past decade. Which is why the whole pregnancy business is rather unexpected, and the reason she sought out Harry and Ginny for advice. Postwar, EWE? Cracky.

** How about [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/945579][Hermione Granger and the Child Protection Movement?]] It's a fairly big series that isn't marked complete but could be considered as such anyway - room for more, but it isn't needed. Harry and Hermione have a very sweet relationship here, and are adopted siblings.

** um I remember this in the linkffn(The problem with purity) but while I liked that fic when I was younger, its weird to read as an adult (how the story approaches sex and virginity, a snape/hermione pairing that's super toxic imo). But the harry part was nice? A lot of harry/draco fics have hermione friendship vibes.
