For some reason, I can't get this desire out of my head.

I don't care if it's smut. I don't care if it's slash.

I just want to see a story that slowly develops a character's fanatic worship of Harry Potter in wartime. Insane, devoted, violent.

The recent request for Harry/Bellatrix, I think, spawned me wanting to see this, but nothing immediately jumps to my head.

linkffn(12511998) is perfect [[/spoiler][with Bellatrix before Harry knocks sense into her, the bastard.]]


** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11388837/1/Adorable-Violence]]) is basically this, but without the wartime aspect. I think I've read another fic that would satisfy your request, but can't remember right now.

  Hermione loves her books. Hermione loves her Harry. Get between Hermione and either at your own peril. Series of connected one-shots.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

**** GASP, I just realised I reccomended the wrong fic. This one has nothing to do with fanatic followers(besides the goblins wanting his powers)

  There is a lot more to magic than simply waving a wand and saying a spell, something Harry Potter knows all too well. After all, when a mere mouth full of someone else's blood can drastically alter your life, learning magic's secrets is a must. (Amoral!Monstrous!Ravenclaw!Harry. No bashing, no romance.)
