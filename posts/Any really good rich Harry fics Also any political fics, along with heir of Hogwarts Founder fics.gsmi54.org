I've become really interested in reading Harry Potter fics that include a lot of politics, particularly on the side of Lord and Heirship. I've read a few fics where Harry comes into his full inheritance for the Potter vaults, where he learns that he's the heir/Lord to many different wizarding lines, and that he's rich. I've also read a few where he's the heir to one of the Founders but I can find any more of those fics.

Do any of you have any suggestions? I do have a few requirements, for the lack of a better word, for them.

- completed/unfinished long fics are fine, but any fics that are unfinished/WIP that are under 30k words I'm not really interested in
- no Daphne/Harry, Harry/Voldemort, Harry/Ron, Harry/Lucius, or Harry/Snape

Thanks for any suggestions!

  "Proofing, also sometimes called final fermentation, is the specific term for allowing dough to rise after it has been shaped and before it is baked."Less than a year has passed since the final battle, and the Ministry is already up to its old tricks. Harry would very much like them to stop ignoring due process, tossing people in Azkaban, controlling the press, and menacing the populace with dementors.He would also like, if at all possible, to bake a passable loaf of bread.

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.

  Harry takes charge of his fate and the war. He manipulates the wizarding world with revolts, scams and his own vast wealth, but even the best laid plans go awry. His mistake costs him more than he bargains for. Regardless, he is committed to making his crazy plan work. Begins after GoF - Some Dumbledore bashing.
