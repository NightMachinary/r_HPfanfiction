. When it comes out he was the secret keeper everyone is revolted since the secret is something in a person soul and can only be given when James fully trusted peter with the secret and to betray that would be horrible. Also - turns out the pure bloods also respected Lily Potter for what she did and her sacrifice


** There's plenty of fics where Peter is caught somehow and Sirius gets a fair trial.

linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7)

Extremely long, complex and well-developed story about Sirius on the run.

linkffn(The Accidental Animagus)

Harry is an Animagus. He can feel that Ron's rat isn't normal.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina)

Peter isn't alive for the trial, but the trial scene is extremely good. Also, badass superhero Regulus.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.
