anyone seen any fanfics where when ron gets knocked out by the chess piece then later hermione wakes him out that it's taken seriously and not forgotten? i've only read a fanfic called harry potter without harry potter which the twins take the blow and later they have to stay in the hospital wing overnight due to a concussion. in real life i learned being out for more then 5 minutes from a head injury can be fatal or cause massive damage that is permanent and disabling

anyone seen a fanfic that takes it seriously or it shows the bad consequences of an injury like that long term?


** Magic.

You have Bludgers in a children's game. Iron cannonballs that speed around at motorway speeds and change direction on a dime. Obviously blunt force trauma isn't a thing for wizards.

*** It wasn't only blunt force trauma if you recall. Ron fell into a tank full of brains and absorbed the consciousness of others for a period of time in OotP.

**** Wouldn't the wiki be better? You could do pretty much the same thing as a google doc, but without the chance of the original creator deleting their account at some point and the whole thing disappearing.

** This is not a criticism, but WOW that's a specific and highly random request OP. I mean, to pick that one particular thing out of all the books, especially something so obscure theme-wise for fan fiction.

This is why I enjoy Fan Fiction so much. The possibilities for alterations are endless lol.

** One of the last episodes of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11302568/][Renegade]] has an scene about the aftermath of the chess match and what it means and how dangerous it could have been but it's a couple of paragraphs in an unfinished AU fic with almost 200K words so...

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.

** Most authors generally ignore that head injuries that knock you out for longer than a few minutes are serious business. You see that in lots of movies and other works.
