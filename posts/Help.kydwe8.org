:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a specific fan fiction to read again. I remember it being significantly long on fanfiction.net

Here's the plot from what I remember:

Harry is essentially adopted by Voldemort. Harry is treated well as long as he follows the rules that Voldemort has set up for him and is rewarded if he does well. As the story progresses, Voldemort becomes a stronger father figure throughout the story and becomes saner. Harry loves him as a father figure by the end of the fic. I think blood adoption was also used, but I cannot confirm or deny that memory of mine. I also think Dumbledore is the true enemy in the story (not 100% sure).

Any help will be much appreciated!

Edit: Found it!

#+begin_quote
  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals on another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.
