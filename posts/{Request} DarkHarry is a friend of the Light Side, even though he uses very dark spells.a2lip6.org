** [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net][Dark Lord Potter]] is an entire forum dedicated to a Harry of this character. There are hundreds of reviewed stories with Harry's written similarly to this, and because the forum is very critical of writing quality, most of the stories have writing quality far above most of the fandom. I'd say that some of the stories discussed even have writing quality nearing that of published novels.

Linkffn(a cadmean victory)

*** Did the author completely abandon HP and the Boy Who Lived? I know there were some more chapters on DLP and the quality kind of went down (there was a weird sideline story where Harry tried to overpower the goblet), but it was one of the more interesting Harry is not the BWL stories out there and was fairly well written.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
