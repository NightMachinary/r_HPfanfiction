tbh, that's exactly what happened with Harry and Ginny in canon. I know you said /no Ginny pairing/, but there you have it.

Really, that only leaves Cho unless you step away from canon... Wow. Harry Potter only had two girlfriends in his entire life.

*** and that was only because J.K. Didn't want Harry (or anyone from the trio) marrying the first person he kissed

Ron's first kiss was Lavender\\
Hermione's was Krum\\
Harry's was Cho

poor Ron getting the short end of the stick :(

**** Ron/Lavender started not because Ron liked her, but because Ginny made this big deal in the hall (or maybe it was the common room) about "Don't judge me for who /I'm/ kissing when /you've/ never kissed anybody!" So then Ron went, "Oh yeah?! I'll show you!"

On one hand, Poor Ron because Lavender was so clingy. On the other hand, Poor Lavender because Ron was only with her to prove a point. The "point" being that he had deep-seated sibling rivalry issues and was determined to out-snog Ginny no matter what.

  It's been a month since Harry broke up with Pansy Parkinson, and he can't get her out of his head. Literally.
