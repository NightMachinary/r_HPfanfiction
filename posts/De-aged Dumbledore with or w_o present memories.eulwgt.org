Where the Weasley twins' prank accidentally lands on Dumbledore, and everyone is shocked to see a teenage, long auburn-haired Dumbledore.

If he has his memories, he would stay as the principal and because he has a young body, Dumbledore uses it to become more active, playing quidditch, running, joining the Weasley twins' pranks. Maybe he'll even sit with the Gryffindors during breakfast and join classes just cause. This one would be pretty funny.

If he doesn't, he has to go to class same year as the Golden Trio and sleeps in the same dorm as them. People will see how smart he is, maybe even better than Hermione. People will try to hide about the first wizarding war but he can't stop from asking where's Grindelwald. This one would include more angst. Edit: (Thanks to Quine_) He meets Aberforth, learns what happens to Ariana and Grindelwald and his whole world just comes crashing down.

In the end, he'll return back to normal :)


** Omg, I was just thinking what if he wanted to know where Ariana is and the McGonagall takes him to Aberforth

**** Also I imagine the meeting with Aberforth. I really like the notion that he lost his memories. And I mean he was a pretty entitled dick back then so I ask myself how he would feel meeting with his brother when he is years older

** Well, he would most likely show more prowess than Hermione but it would be so interesting for everyone to see what he was like back then. His ideologies were very different and he was still with Grindenwald at the time.

** There's one crack-fic where a chance comment clues everyone into how to be immortal without a Philosophers Stone - Human Transfiguration. One brief moment of mental "how could I have been so stupid" later, McGonagall transforms her body back to its early-twenties. Dumbledore follows suit... also transforming into a young (adult) woman.

Sadly, I can't remember if it was a one-shot or not.
