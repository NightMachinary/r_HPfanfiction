Hey guys,

I'm looking for a fiction that focuses on marauders fighting voldemort. but i don't want it to be a prologue to hp canon. I want it to be a complete story hence the requirment of either au or time travel.

Thanks in advance :)

*** To be honest i was kinda hopeless. I certainly didn't expect not one, but two suggestions in 30 minutes. Both looks promising, thanks. 1 question, you tagged the 2nd wip but in ff it's status is complete, why is that?

**** Huh, really? I haven't read the newest chapter yet and didn't notice the "complete" bit. I'll edit it.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8311387/1/][Roundabout Destiny]] is an AU Marauders fic where Hermione is cast back in the past and wakes up as Hermione Potter, James Potters twin sister. She retains all of Granger's memories but is determined to change her brother's destiny. Starts in the first year, contains some smut. Great fic though and it's complete.
