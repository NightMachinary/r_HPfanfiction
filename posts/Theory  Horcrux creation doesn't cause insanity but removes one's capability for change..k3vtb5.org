In HP the main difference between live people and ghosts is that the latter are incapable of change. Ghosts are immortal but static. A horcrux creates a similar effect .When Riddle created the diary he was obsessed with removing muggleborn and escaping death , after learning of his bloodline he convinced of his own perfection and superiority.

By creating a horcrux he essentially got stuck in his teenage self's mindset almost like a portrait. He created further horcruxes because of his fear of death which he could not overcome with rationality. He was obsessed with killing Harry before the creation of his last Horcruxes and as such became irrationally obsessed with this goal till the end. This theory neatly explains the fall of Tom Riddle to Voldemort (a silly name he was unable to get rid of).

What do you think of this theory? Are there any fics that use this theory? What would a no-horcrux AU look like?


** I think this is a wonderfully poetic theory! It does seem to tick all the boxes in explaining Voldemort inside and out.

** This is more or less canon, I think.

Dumbledore tells us in HBP that Voldemort's mental abilities are not altered by his horcruxes:

#+begin_quote
  Harry sat in thought for a moment, then asked, “So if all of his Horcruxes are destroyed, Voldemort could be killed?”

  “Yes, I think so,” said Dumbledore. “Without his Horcruxes, Voldemort will be a mortal man with a maimed and diminished soul. Never forget, though, that while his soul may be damaged beyond repair, his brain and his magical powers remain intact. It will take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like Voldemort even without his Horcruxes.”
#+end_quote

And JKR explained on her website that by taking Harry's blood (and Lily's protection) into himself, Voldemort had accidentally given himself the capacity to change and be redeemed, implying that this was something he lacked before:

#+begin_quote
  Having taken Harry's blood into himself, Voldemort is keeping alive Lily's protective power over Harry. So Voldemort himself acts almost like a Horcrux for Harry -- except that the power of Lily's sacrifice is a positive force that not only continues to tether Harry to life, but gives Voldemort himself one last chance (Dumbledore refers to this last hope in chapter 35). Voldemort has unwittingly put a few drops of goodness back inside himself; if he had repented, he could have been healed more deeply than anyone would have supposed. But, of course, he refused to feel remorse.

So yes. The fanon idea that Voldemort and Tom Riddle were substantially different in character or goals is largely an invention of Harry/Voldemort shippers in a vain attempt to make that pairing more palatable.

*** There are some interesting implications and story ideas possible with this theory. Consider linkffn(Romantic Idealism) in which Riddle spends a few weeks obsessing over Hermoine after the creation of his horcrux. 7 years later he finds that he is still obsessed with her without reason.

Voldemort's fear and suspicion of Dumbledore during the war and even after his murder could stem from his teenage days rather than because of any actions Dumbledore might have taken against him.

  She falls in love with him when she's 12, but by the time she's 17 she wants him dead. For Tom Riddle, its vice versa. Tomione. AU. M for a reason.

I agree with you that much of the difference between Voldemort and Tom in fanfics is for the sake of LV/HP shippers. But that aside there is a big difference between Tom Riddle and Voldemort in Canon. Not in their goals or their character-basics but in the way they act. Tom Riddle was much more manipulative - the way he got through Hogwarts, the way he manipulated the teachers, Helena Ravenclaw and later Hepzibah Smith are fundamentally different to the acts of the later Voldemort who worked mainly through fear. I don't say that Riddle as a teen/young adult didn't wish to act like Voldemort did later - I think he did. But either damaging his soul or fighting a war ripped away the restrictions he gave himself for appearance sake.

*** The theory is merely an explanation for his mentality not a justification absolving his crimes. Canon Voldemort does not make much sense as a Human. His character is feels two dimensional and shallow . No justification is given for why the mudblood genius in Slytherin spurned and insulted by the nobility would work to help them.

It also makes sense that powerful magic like a horcrux would have some cost. It also fits in neatly with the theory of ghosts and portraits. How else would you explain the insane blunder at the end of DH which got him killed. He was incapable of accepting his inferiority even when HP explained his mastery of the elder wand despite basic logic suggesting a different course of action than yet another AK.
