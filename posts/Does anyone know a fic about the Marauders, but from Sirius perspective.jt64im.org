I was curious to know if anyone has ever tried to write a fic telling the Marauders story from Sirius perspective. Like, showing what happened after he and James met, how they figured out about Remus condition, how they became friends with Peter and specially telling about his life as Black.

I think Sirius is such a great and interesting character , but I don't really know any Sirius centric fanfiction.

If you know any fic like this and can suggest me, I would really appreciate! Thanks!


** I believe [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/series/61511][A Bond of Family]] is mainly focused on Sirius (it's been a while since I've read it) it follows the marauders to October 31,1981 and picks up again in PoA.
