** There's this charming scene from linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13230340/1/Harry-Is-A-Dragon-And-That-s-Okay]]), Chapter 24:

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore then checked a watch. “My goodness. It seems that this whole conversation has taken forty-five minutes less time than I thought it might. I don't suppose you have any more questions you might want to ask?”

  Harry couldn't think of any, and said so.

  “Then perhaps you will indulge me in a little pastime?” Dumbledore asked. “I have some small skill at magic, you see, and it's rare that I get a chance to show it off.”

  That sounded so odd that Harry had to see what Dumbledore could possibly mean. “I wouldn't mind that at all, Sir,” he said, shifting a little in his seat.

  Instead of retrieving his wand, however, Dumbledore took out a pack of playing cards.

  “Pick a card,” he said, fanning them out in front of him with the backs facing him. “Any will do.”

  Harry took the Two of Hearts, and memorized which one it was before putting it back in the deck.

  Dumbledore shuffled them at that point, mixing them up thoroughly, then turned them all to face him and frowned.

  After a long moment, he removed one from the pack with his slender fingers.

  “Is this your card?” he asked.

  Harry looked at the Four of Clubs, and shook his head.

  “Bother,” Dumbledore pronounced, putting the cards down. “It always seems very simple when the Muggles do it.”

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** I actually read a fic a long time ago with the exact opposite, where Harry was doing magic to impress muggles while living on the street, but then Arthur Weasley showed up and arrested him for breaking the Statute of Secrecy. Unfortunately, I don't remember the name. Harry had 2 siblings who were actually Snape's children, and one was a squib...?
