Would she have written in it and sacrificed her life force just to resurrect her beloved lord ASAP?


** I think Bellatrix would have put the diary in her gringotts vault like she did with the Hufflepuff's cup. As result chamber of secrets would have stayed closed in HP's second year.

** IIRC, Voldemort never told Bellatrix and Lucius what the cup and diary were or what they could do, just that they needed to keep them safe. So if he swapped who he gave each one to, there probably wouldn't be much change. Bellatrix would probably have hidden the first in her vault and been arrested before she had a chance to use it. The biggest difference would probably be Lucius not being able to plant the cup in CoS.

*** Lucius knew what the diary could do before he gave it to Ginny. He had to, otherwise it would never have been mentioned where Dobby could hear it, and he never would have tried to stop Harry from coming back to school.
