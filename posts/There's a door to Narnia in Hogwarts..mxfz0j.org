So Founders were simple four wizards that were unimpresive. But then they found a door to Narnia and went there, due to time compretion they lives their full lives and more, doing all sort of things.

When they came back, they simply wanted to have relatively simple lives and educate wizardly with their knowledhe. So they founded Hogwarts in the same castpe where they had found the unfoundable door.

Salazar was a bit leery of muggles, because he had the worst ecperiences with simple humans in Narnia (insert Narnia backstory here). So he created proactive defenses and tried to protect muggle born children by doing the changling thing.

Understandably other founders were horrified. And verbal fighting ensued eventualy escalating to spell fights.

That's mostly backstory. Noe Harry finds the door and enters. Due to timy wimy bs other four people from other four houses are there already. You might timy wimy their timelines too.

Esencialy when Harry exits only few hours later, he doesn't remember his friends names or anyones really. Dude spent a lot of time there. He's something like archwizard, but well he has no real understanding on his situation.

So cue a talking between equals with Dumbledore. Two old Arcwizards starting the talking about current situation and devolving into magical theorycrafting.

So just a brain fart.


** The idea of Founders living in Narnia for some time reminds me of that theory that the Pevensie siblings are actually Hogwarts Founders. I would totally read a fic like that.
