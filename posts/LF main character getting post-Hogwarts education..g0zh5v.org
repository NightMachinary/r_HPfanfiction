Whether it's a Mastery, or a universe where “wizarding university” exists. I'd prefer if one of the main focuses of the story was the education.


** Well a fun one is a Harry Potter/Rosario Vampire crossover story called Harry Potter and a Vampire by mjimeyg. Basically it's Harry Potter at the Rosario Vampire anime "monster school" that starts after Harry Loses his "dementor" case and is kicked out of school.

Then another one is a time travel story where Harry and Hermione start attending a magic school in Japan over the summers prior to attending Hogwarts and continues attending during the summers between Hogwarts. It's called 30 Minutes that Changed Everything by Radaslab.

Breakfast in New York by Radaslab has Hermione leaving to find her parents and never returning.
