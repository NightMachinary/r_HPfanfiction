Anyone know of any stories focused on Harry or even an OC going to Hogwarts and said main character is just kinda normal.

Not better than their teachers at magic, not the wielder of rare and unusual powers, not the inheritor of an ancient and politically powerful dynasty, not so damn potent that the entire student population is queuing up to sleep with them.

Just a kid, going to a magical school and despite the occasional adventure mainly dealing with fairly normal school problems in a fairly normal way.

Nothing short please.
