** I wish i remembered the name but I remember starting one where when he's like hit by the killing curse he chooses to get on a train with fetus voldy. On the train the baby starts healing looking like a normal baby. The conductor informs Harry he can choose to go to the after life or another world. He chooses another world where all the people he knew who died in the first war are still alive his parents Sirius etc . He hopes to use the horcrux info and like in his world there is a boy who lived. But in this world its Neville not Harry and Voldemort still looks human hes achieved immortality in a different way. Harry moves in to a house near the burrow and lives with young Tom and a ghost. I'll post the link of i find it again

*** Master of Death by esama linkao3(1358209) It hasn't been updated since 2014 so it probably won't ever be finished, but it's not a cliff hanger. I recommend it.

** You may like linkao3(World in Pieces) if you haven't read it; Harry ends up getting dragged into another world immediately after the Battle of Hogwarts and expected to take down their Voldemort, since their Harry is dead.

It meets all your requirements with one small caveat - other!Harry and other!Draco were a couple, though canon!Harry is definitely not having any of that and is not interested in either Draco like that. (It also features mentor!Snape and manipulative!Dumbledore, which are definite YMMV tropes.)

  Harry is summoned to an alternate universe still suffering under Voldemort less than an hour after his own defeat of the bastard. Worse, he's not the first Harry Potter they've called on this way. Worst yet (at the moment), there is no way back home. But give Harry time, and he's likely to find something that's even worse.

  The world is breaking. War and technology push on the edge of the unbelievable as S.H.I.E.L.D. desperately tries to keep the peace. Soldier and scientist no longer hold the line alone, as an ancient fire burns alongside them. The last of all wizards.

  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...
