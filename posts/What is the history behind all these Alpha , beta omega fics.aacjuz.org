Like when did this trope start and why has it suddenly become so popular in HP Fanfiction


** According to [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Alpha/Beta/Omega][the wiki]]:

#+begin_quote
  The trope originated in Supernatural fandom with a few very specific AU kink meme prompts for the J2 RPF ship. The first one[2] was in May 2010 and has also been identified as the culprit responsible for the popularity of knotting in SPN fandom:

**** I am sure it would still be a thing even without that meme. It an obvious solution to people who want to write male pairings featuring pregnancy and biological children. Thankfully it's usually an easy trope to avoid as long as authors tag things correctly.

*** Its a concept that has started from the want to make male character become pregnant. Because some people believe that Male X Male Pairings need to be able to have children, for without children couples are not complete. They created a big system, including animalistic heat cycles in which Omegas will be lustdriven maniacs that, if not sedated, will jump any Alpha to mate with them. Its absurd and caters to the yaoi-fanbase. Not my pair of shoes and I wholly reject the whole rapey thing that is part of it. But some people seem to enjoy it.

***** I am afraid you will find that God has left the building quite some time ago my friend.

May I interest you in Rubeus Hagrid, our friend and savior? He'll walk around at night, crossbow on his shoulders and a small candle-lit lantern in his hand to hunt the mpreg-beasties while they rutt around in the Forbidden Forest.

***** For some reason, it continues to be big in Avengers fandom long after it mostly died out in other fandoms, and people don't always seem to tag for it or put it in summaries. So you can be reading a perfectly ordinary adventure and then suddenly Clint goes into heat, or Tony Stark is discovered (Mulan-style) to be an Omega when they take him to a doctor: instant angst and presumably sexytimes (I always bail when I realise, so maybe these fics are all perfectly chaste and innocent).

** I'd guess Teen Wolf, which started airing in 2011 - what the fics always reminded me of and matches about when it was getting popular to when the show was first airing that had a whole alpha/beta/omega thing in it. I literally think just because HP has werewolves that's all the connection that was needed. I'm probably totally wrong, but just what they remind me of (from summaries, I'm not a fan)
