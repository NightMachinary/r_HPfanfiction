"James, I'd like for you to have a seat, I need to tell you both something."

The young man, who had been leaning against the wall, looked at his pregnant wife with raised eyebrows. Lily shrugged, and so he walked over and took a seat next to her, facing their guest.

The 3rd occupant of their living room took out his wand, and deliberately placed it on the center table, very clearly out of his reach as he leaned back into his chair. With a deep breath, he explained: "I am the one known as Lord Voldemort, and I would like to make an unbreakable vow right now that I will never harm your child."

I have been playing around with this idea in my head. Figured I'd check out other fanfics that have explored this concept to avoid things that have already done, before I try my hand at writing. So my question is: can you recommend similar stories?


** Since Harry isn't a horcrux yet, the entire prophecy is considered nullified. Voldemort's power doesn't fall, but being next to Harry is the safest place in the world.

It's often speculated in the HP community that the ministry was only weeks from falling, so with no fall of Voldemort, he becomes the puppet master some seventeen years earlier. This time, Dumbledore doesn't have a sacrificial bow who lived to throw in.

***** Or he is the manipulative(/idiot/)!Dumbledore and decides to voluntary Snape to do this onerous sacrifice. Of course, as he is evil he will need to make sure that Snape is properly almost having an OD of loyalty potions and spells besides having random chunks of memory erased and being under amortenia (he loved Lily, which should make the potion work even better if targeting her, so naturally the potion will have to be keyed four-ways to all the marauders) all of this on top of the imperius of course, and while Severus is “taking one (dozen) for the team” Dumbledore will take the implicit invitation given by Snape in the form of being used in his plan to snoop around on his vault for money and anything that catchs his fancy.
