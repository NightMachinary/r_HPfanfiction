Some time ago I stumbled upon a Crossover with what I believe was Dungeons & Dragons. I couldn't read the story at the time and thought I had saved the link somewhere but I can't find it now. I remember that Dumbledore had to travel to another world to give Harry his Hogwarts letter. Also Harry was already an adult there and was at least a bit famous. I know it's not very much info but maybe someone knows the story.


** linkffn(8096183) maybe? Definitely a D&D crossover, and a pretty good one IMO. Not yet complete. Doesn't center around Harry, though, it centers around an OC, Milo.

** I have vague recollections of the story you're talking about. Maybe it's part of Rorschach's Blot's long-running, plot bunny collection story /Odd Ideas/. I think the relevant chapter is 133: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2565609/133/Odd-Ideas]]
