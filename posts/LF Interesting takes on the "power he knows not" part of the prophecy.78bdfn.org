EDIT: Human fanfic bot on duty

Most of the time it's either love or the Deathly Hallows being used as a substitute. Any more "out there" takes on it?

Bonus points for hippy Harry beating the Dark Lord with flower power ;)

Apparently the bot isn't working. My bad.

** I don't remember what fic it was but there was one where Sirius came back from behind the veil as an undead type being and could control all other spirits? Harry somewhat controlled Sirius and used him to defeat Voldemort. The story was from Snape's perspective I think.

Harry can see magic.

I'm very interested in seeing good fics where the power he knows not is actually a unique magical power instead of something abstract.

*** Blindness is great, though you might find the Final Battle a little underwhelming if you're looking for an epic conflict between Harry and LV. linkffn(Blindness)

**** I love this fic, and there's another confrontation coming up between his allies and the second primary antagonist. The take on magic is fresh and intriguing, and I'm hooked on the current arc of his reconstructed love.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3468902/1/Demon-s-Feign-Merlin-s-Pain][Demon's Feign, Merlin's Pain]] featuring Nymphie Staffcharmer, for while Harry didn't know what love is, he certainly had larger than Voldemort appreciation for wizarding worlds most famous pornstar.
