Hey guys I'm looking for fanfics similar to "Departure from the Diary" or "limpieza de sangre", where Harry meets fem Voldemort and they understand or work together it doesn't have to be fem TR it can also be diary Tom or sane Voldemort.


** Maybe this? Linkffn(Harry Potter and the ashes of chaos)

They haven't really started working together yet. Voldemort sort of mentored Harry in first year, even though there was some conflict that split them apart for a bit. She's sort of still mentoring him now, he just doesn't realize it. This is exceptionally well-written and it updates every weekend. No idea where the author is going with their relationship, but I am damn excited to find out.

  AU: When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween night, she not only created a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply. What will happen when a more jaded, more focused, and more gifted Harry Potter shows up at Hogwarts in 1991 after being abandoned and forgotten? Fem!Voldemort, WBWL

*** I am also curious to see how things develop with Voldemort and what their plans are. The diary of Emily is really well done and I think she is a good mentor.

**** That's assuming it is the diary. For all we know, Harry might be communicating with modern day Emily somehow. The mind magic system in this is really advanced, so it wouldn't shock me. But yes, it is very well done. One of my favourite ongoing stories for sure.

***** If u haven't already, I'd suggest reading sarcasm and slytherin and Prince of Slytherin, 2 series which the author of Ashes has been verrrry heavily inspired by and has taken a lot from.

  Not all wars are black and white, as Harry learns when the second war with Voldemort seems to be painted in nothing but shades of grey. In which Harry is confused, Tonks is overwhelmed, Barty is a genius, Snape hates everyone, Dumbledore is trying his best, and Voldemort is having the time of her life. fem!Voldemort

  He didn't remember much. He didn't remember her. The accident changed their lives and sent Emma into a tailspin, desperate for Killian to come back to her. But when he finally wakes up from his coma, the past six years are gone. He has no recollection of their love, but Emma refuses to give up on them. She's got her work cut out for her, but some memories are worth fighting for.

  Voldemort isn't a man. Ginny Weasley died in the Chamber. Twin divergences, though insignificant compared to the infinite majesty of the universe, spell a destiny irrevocably altered. Watch as Harry's life, the lives of those around him, and eventually the fate of Magical Britain herself are affected by his slowly-growing relationship with a female Tom Riddle.
