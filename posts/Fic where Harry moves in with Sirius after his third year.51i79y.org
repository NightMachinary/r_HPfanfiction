** The only one I know of for 4th year is linkffn(8045114) There are also linkffn(9469064; 4062601) which are both Harry leaves pre hogwarts. Finally there's linkffn(9822874; 8764091) which both start in 5th year and in my opinion aren't as good as the other 3.

  In which Harry understands Victorian flower language at age 11. Events grow gradually further and further from the original. Features CharacterDevelopment!Crabbe and Goyle, and many other not-quite-expected variations. This story has reached its conclusion; enjoy. Watch out for the April Fools' chapter.

** Harry moves in with Sirius during third year in my sory "Patron", but the story starts with fourth year and it's an AU, so I'm not certain if it fits your request - Sirius was exonerated in third year here.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
