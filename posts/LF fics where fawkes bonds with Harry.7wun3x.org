** Well, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Veil of Mystery; Harry Potter and the Ring of Reduction) both have that as a major plot point. Sadly, they also have the Harry-as-a-student-is-DADA-professor nonsense.

  A series of unrelated scenes from various POVs (Harry features in every other one). Begins with "Flying," in which Harry learns that there are still a few things able to challenge him in the air, and goes from there.

** linkffn(9036071)

Fawkes joins the story not in the beginning, and his bond with Harry grows slowly, but he becomes an important character especially in the later chapters.

The story has its faults, but I enjoyed it very much.

** Hmm...nothing comes to mind.

I did come up with an idea in a 'post your ideas' thread once, where Harry actually becomes a phoenix when he's hit by the Killing Curse at the age of 1; Lily's protection causing him to transcend death rather than merely avoid it.

The idea was that he'd be adopted and raised by a normal phoenix somewhere off in the mountains, until 11 years later when a letter to him shows up. Then you get a story about a pure-good, but raised-by-animals phoenix-animagus (anthromagus?) Harry being exposed to Hogwarts.
