Good evening all! I'm new to this whole Reddit scene but someone suggested I try asking here, so here it goes! I hope this post is allowed, but if not I apologise, feel free to remove and no hard feelings.

I'm 50k words (with no end in sight, but lots of ideas) of a Ron/Hermione story that I've wanted to write for like a decade and now and I'm looking for someone to be my beta. I don't plan on posting a single chapter until I've completed every single word of it because I'm the worst at starting stories I never complete and I know how annoying that can be. But I feel like I need some feedback as I go and so I'm hoping to find someone to beta my story for me and give me their thoughts and feelings and to point out glaringly obvious mistakes and plot holes I may have overlooked. There is no deadline, I'll post it when I'm happy with the completed story. Also, if you start and decide not to continue I won't mind.

One of the main themes of this story is teen pregnancy. I thought I should say it because I know full well it will put some people off. I know the trope is done to death but I hope I've found some nuance and made it interesting. If you're still reading, here are some more deets:

It's told from Hermione's POV. It starts during spring of 6th year and goes all the way through the battle of Hogwarts and beyond (although how far beyond I haven't decided). I've utilised certain events from the books to weave into my story so it's somewhat canon compliant. Rated T - Some adult themes but nothing explicit. Death, torture, bloodshed - you know, the stuff that usually happens in a war, but again nothing explicit. The Harry/Ginny pairing features but I'm not mad on them so there won't a ton of them.

With all due respect to JKR, I reject her rejection of the Ron/Hermione pairing! I still love them, all these years later. I've never written for them though and I'm excited for someone to read my attempt.

Is anyone interested?

** I would be interested, but I barely have the time to write my own stuff these days. If nobody pops up here (and I recommend reposting in a couple days to see if anyone missed this post originally), then there's a regular beta-finding thing in the Fanfiction reddit and FFnet has a beta-finding function that you could try too. If you're up for some honest feedback, then you could also sign up to Dark Lord Potter and post there, but make sure you've thickened your skin beforehand because they don't pull punches there.

*** Thank you for replying! I'm not in any hurry, so if you really want to read a few chapters then I can wait until you have time. I looked at the ffnet section but got a bit overwhelmed! How to you choose? I wish there was more of a filter function on there to find someone who shares your ships. I'll try the Fanfiction Reddit though, thanks for the tip. I'm still trying to figure out how this site works! x

**** Sorry, my schedule isn't going to open up any time soon. I'm actually looking for work right now, so it's most likely only going to get more packed. :D

If you hover over 'betas', there's a 'specific' section at the bottom, click books, then navigate to 'H', then Harry Potter to get the list of every Beta who'd be okay with doing Harry Potter. Then you can filter a bit more at the side there.

Other than that, you just click the names and scan through their beta profiles (which is where you'll find any information on ships, if the Beta cares at all about any specific ship) until you find someone you like or agree with and message them to see if you can get along and work together well.
