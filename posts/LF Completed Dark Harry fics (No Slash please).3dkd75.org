  Dresden Files

I've never read the Dresden Files, so I've always avoided this fic. Can it be read anyway without missing something?

**** It's actually better if you /haven't/ read Dresden Files! Everything seems more /magical/.

That said, yes, you can. You miss absolutely nothing if you haven't read Dresden Files.

I wish I could find/replace 'orbs' with 'eyes' it would significantly improve the story. Who the fuck says orbs.

*** I both agree and disagree. This trilogy is probably the best all-around work in the genre, but I would say that there are probably a few works out there that could top it over all. The sacrifices arc, Alexandra quick, James Potter and.... , in some circles MoR. all of these are great reads. But for Dark Harry? go to Denarian Trilogy. I support this post's suggestion, just not the entire post :p

**** Yeah, I agree. Denarian is one of the only Dark Harry fics I can stand, and probably the best overall. But it's not THE best fanfic, not even close.

**** Hmm. I guess it's just a matter of opinion in the end. For me, Joe's trilogies (* of Time + * of the Hero trilogies) + Shezza's Denarian Trilogy outdo all of those by massive leaps and bounds.

*** Argh. Megamatt09. Not to dis the linker here, it isn't their fault this author is /ehhh/, but I'd not bother unless you are really into what he's doing thematically.

Quality is usually really meh, plotting is shallow. I've now started giving his stuff an automatic pass. His non-crossover stuff is better, but not by much in my experiences. He also keeps writing the same DC/HP harem smut stuff over and over again, having moved the smuttiest over to AO3. And it isn't good stuff--I should know. So...I'm not into it, is my point.

YMMV.

But look. Even that summary in the link has an obvious grammar error three years after first publishing and an additional edit...

  AU. Harry is shunned not only Ron, but Hermione as well after the Goblet of Fire incident. Ginny befriends Harry and history changes. Future Dark!Harry Dark!Ginny pairing, extended summary inside. Note from 2012: I'm not a huge fan of this story now, but leaving it up for historical purposes for those who do enjoy it.
