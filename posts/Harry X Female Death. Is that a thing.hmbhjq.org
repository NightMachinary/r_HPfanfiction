  After decades of war, the world is on the brink of destruction, with no hope for survival. The only way to go on is to travel back in time and change everything that's gone wrong, starting with Tom Riddle. That's how Harry Potter found himself in 1941, a time he had hoped never to find himself in again. Why 1941? Death has a pretty messed up sense of humour, that's why.

** I've come across a few in passing that have a male Death (such as in Supernatural crossovers) too, but it's a thing, yeah.

There are very few fics that explore this, though.

Some have her as an OC: Others as Endless!Death, et cetera.

I remember one where Lily survives after making a bargain with Death, and Harry grows up with a pseudo love-interest/sister-figure/best-friend called 'Thana' (short for a name related to death).

Best thing is that it's implied Thana knows of her nature in an 'Orange and Blue' mentality while stuck in a human brain, and her body is made up of, er, 'repurposed' human body-parts from the scum of society, like Death Eaters.

She has ulterior motives for Harry, and Lily knows/dreads this, but it's obvious she loves him -- it's just mixed with Eldritch shit, lol.

Can't remember the name, though.

  The Tale of Three Brothers was not a legend. It was a warning. No one cheats Death. And luckily for Lily Potter, the promise of the Cloak's return in exchange for her son's life was a fair deal. Stare into the abyss, Harry Potter, and we will see who blinks first.

  AU. The Rewrite! There is much more to Harry Potter than meets the eye. Much more. Book One of Four. Harry/Kara/Faora/Diana/Karen/Multi. Massive harem.

** Fair Lady has already been linked so I'll say Path of Decision.

Brilliant story, just don't go in expecting fluff of any kind.

  Voldemort is in power, but the Wizarding World fights back. Harry Potter, Master of Death, is faced with a choice, move forward or change everything? Warning: This story is weird and not for everyone.

  Kuroka had thought she would fail. Her nine lives had been used up trying to save her sister, but it had all been futile. She had resigned to simply escaping, but out of the blue, a random man claiming to be a wizard appears, wielding powers beyond anything anyone had ever seen. With his help, she may just yet be able to save her sister, altering fate. The Master of Death comes.
