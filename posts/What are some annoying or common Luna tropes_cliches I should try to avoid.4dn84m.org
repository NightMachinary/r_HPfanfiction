Obviously she's not going to be a seer or have special powers.

Context on my story:

- It's not a humor or an action fic.

- 3rd person limited.

- Half Lunas perspective, half Harry's

- Luna is an adult, about 22-25

- Luna is a magizoologist that spends much of her time in the field isolated from social interaction.

- Eventual H/L, might start off L/Rolf


** Reposting a comment from a similar thread:

Fanfics that features Luna in a predominate role almost always fall victim to one big problem: they telegraph their moves way too far ahead of time and suck all of the remaining conflict from the story.

So what's a better way to use her inherent oddness?

IIRC there was an interview with JKR around the time of OOtP (where Luna makes her first appearance). The interviewer asked her about some of the themes she wanted to emphasise in the novel. Rowling was keen to point out that Harry had an awful lot of growing up to do still and she illustrated this with an interesting example: the two train rides to and from Hogwarts. In the chapter covering the journey to the castle, Harry empathises with Neville who didn't want to be anywhere near 'Loony Lovegood.' He's intensely embarrassed when Cho Chang comes by his compartment and believes that she quickly runs off because of the odd company he keeps. Less than ten pages from the end of that book, Harry and Luna commiserate on the loss of loved ones. On the train ride back from Hogwarts, Harry realises he doesn't care what Cho thinks of him or his friends, thus displaying the personal growth Rowling was trying to highlight.

I tend to enjoy stories that do the same thing with Luna that Rowling did: treat her oddness as a milemarker that allows Harry to demonstrate personal growth. Whenever fanfics have him instantly accept her odd ways, I find myself wondering if I'm reading about Harry Potter or Harry-Sue. But this is just a personal preference and I'd love to hear what other people have to say about her.

tl;dr: canon Harry didn't instantly accept Luna's oddness. Unless you want him to be OOC, make their relationship /slowly/ develop or you'll be no different than every other `shipper fic out there.

*** I believe that was the Memerson interview, actually. JKR contrasted the Hogwarts ride to OotP with the one in HBP to show how Harry matured as a character, where he views Luna and Neville as not being 'cool' in OotP and then stood up for them after the Battle of DoM when Romilda asked Harry if he actually wanted to sit with those 'losers' instead of her and her friends (this was in context of her discussing why Harry and Ginny are a good fit, I think).

And that's IF they're trying to respect canon, which in this community is actually a big if.

Anyway, as long as she's not a seer or nymphomaniac, I'll usually consider it good enough. Oh, and that she can't imediately figure out everything that's going on. FOr gods sake, we're talking about the girl that thought Sirius was a member of the wizard beatles.

**** Yeah, I don't mind bi, I just hate when they show her as ready to nail anyone or a seer.

The worst are when she's the exact opposite of a hermione in a story and they're in a triad relationship where hermione isn't really into girl girl but Luna keeps pressing (Though Lunacy, Luna, and whatever it's called is one of my favorite stories). I'm a big fan of good poly stories but Lunar Harmony stories are rarely written as such.

The part of Luna that makes her so great is that she is intelligent, but still refrains from letting knowledge destroy her vision of the world.

This one I have violated. Can you give me your reasoning, so I can decide if I should take this into consideration in my story?

Let me expand - In my story two of the creatures she speaks about, Wrackspurts and Crumple Horned Snorcacks, are real creatures and they really exist, and Luna discovers them in her journeys. Furthermore, she determines that some of her other creatures don't exist, or at least likely not in the description that she's familiar with. Being a magizoologist, she approaches these creatures in a logical way and attempts to use a methodical approach to finding them. What is your argument against this, if any?

Don't make her being somewhat odd her only characteristic. That's the cheapest way of writing a character - taking that one well established canon thing - and using only it.
