I've read a lot of fanfiction in the last 12 years or so. I've definitely read some that meet my requests at some point in them. I think the most recent I read is the Harry/Daphne fic with her as his lawyer or something. I'm just curious about any others. Hopefully decently-written but I'm not expecting anything that makes my head explode in wonder...

Thank ya if you can help!


** Have you read "The Watch" by Rorschach's Blot?

It's not complete, but still gets updates every now and then.

*** I don't think so... I've read quite a few of his. I don't see it in his FF account. I found a Dropbox version I think but is there a browser version I'm not finding?

  AU. Harry didn't go to Hogwarts, he went to Stonewall Secondary. His main goal in life was to leave the Dursleys' and go to college, until Remus Lupin finds him on his seventeenth birthday and his life changes all at once. See Ch 1 AN for more info.
