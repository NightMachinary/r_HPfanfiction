two longish harry potter fanfictions i read a while back

first one is where fem harry swaps places with her cousin and takes his place at hogwarts, real tamora pierce vibes. think she apprentices under snape at one point

second is a AU which had like 4 books written, almost worked as a standalone novel, set in america with female lead. i remember one of her friends was asian. and there may have been some faery/underworld/nevernever crap going on too.

sorry for the crap descriptions, but am craving a reread if anyone can help out


** First is definitely The Pureblood Pretense linkffn(7613196)

Second... /might/ be Holly Evans and the Spiral Path linkffn(4916690)

Edit: Oops, Lord_Anarchy is right, I think about the second. I misremembered the wrong female protagonist story.

  Holly is prickly and poisonous like her namesake, only with Hermione she's more normal. Dark and disturbing Girl!Harry tells her story via an enchanted journal.
