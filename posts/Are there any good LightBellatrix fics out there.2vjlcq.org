I was reading one a while back, and it got me hooked.

I should reread this in full at some point. It's one of my favorite time-travel fics.

I enjoy fics with 'strong' characters in general. Well defined characters are pretty important to any story.

** If Bellamione is your thing, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7755315/1/Those-Gilded-Chains-We-Wear][Those Gilded Chains We Wear]] also comes highly recommended. I wouldn't exactly call it Light!Bellatrix, but I also don't want to spoil the plot too much.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10099028/1/Murder-Most-Horrid][Murder Most Horrid]].. sort of. It's an AU where Voldemort never existed and Bella's a detective in the DMLE.

*** This looks really interesting, especially because the DMLE isn't bloated with Aurors. Great rec!

** I read a REALLY good one a little while back, focusing on Andromeda Tonks point of view (from when she was a kid, raised in the black's house with Narcissa and Bellatrix as sisters). It was an extremely good read, but I seem to be unable to find it.

It featured Andromeda as the middle sister learning to heal and protect her younger siblings, with Bellatrix acting out, getting hooked on heroine, using dark magic, all to deal with the violence and abuse of the home life. Alternatively, the younger sister Narcissa becomes cold, withdrawn, not fully present. It's a very interesting read and actually something I fully accept as headcannon. Ill see if I can find it here... (still looking, I'd really like to re-read it)

*** HOLY SHIT I FOUND IT. [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/65319]] I have surprised even myself. Again, I find the writing and characters so in character that I accept it as my own headcannon. Enjoy (and let me know what you think!)
