EDIT: I found it y'all! The story was called "Candidus" by kuraokamiko.

--------------

Hopefully this is an okay place to post this! I'm currently haunted by the memory of an old fanfiction I used to love that I read around 2007 (yeah, long shot I know) but I recall it being very popular. I've tried some Google-fu with no real luck and thought I'd ask if anyone happens to know it.

Okay, here is all I can remember:

THE BEGGINING

The story is an AU that James wasn't killed and raised Harry. They did not have a very good or close relationship. It was kind of formal. He called him "Father."

When Harry is sent to Hogwarts, he befriends Draco on the train. They discuss houses, etc. and Harry says that he will probably be in either Ravenclaw or Gryffindor while Draco says that he will most likely be in Sytherin. Neither minds about the other's house choices.

Harry ends up being sorted into Ravenclaw. Harry and Draco become friends.

PLOT TWIST

Snape is really Harry's dad. He had a relationship with Lily while she was married and that's how Harry came around. When James looked at the birth certificate several years later, he was very upset but never told anyone.

Harry somehow finds out and an arrangement is made that Snape is "dad" and James is "father." Draco, who tries to figure out what's going on because Harry doesn't tell him, has a theory that Snape and James have been talking so much because they are lovers. Harry laughs off the idea and tells him the truth. Similarities between Harry and Snape are pointed out.

SHIPPING

Harry and Draco are friends at frist, and a romance is gently showed. One night Harry is walking back late and can't make it to the Ravenclaw common room. Draco takes him back to Sytherin and the fall asleep together and get teased about it later. Other hints include holding hands and practically sitting on eachother without noticing. It's very innocent.

I think Sirius and Remus were in a relationship, but I don't remember for sure.

TIMELINE

Takes Harry's adventure from first year. Takes a twist at the stories from all years. At time I was reading the author last left off in the middle of third year (all years were in the same story) Peter Pettigrew had escaped from azkaban. He was accused as opposed to Sirius. He was getting help from the inside to try to get to Harry. Harry was under heavy survalence and not happy about it.

OTHER LITTLE TIDBITS I REMEMBER

-Harry made friends with Cedric -Harry's best friend in Ravenclaw was Terry Boot -Terry and Draco didn't like eachother -Harry has a pet snake (named Scyther?) that Snape got for him that get's killed in 2nd or 3rd year and he is devisted over it. -Harry slicked his hair back? -There was a Yahoo group for this fic? -Snape and James had different ideas about how Harry should be raised and often fought over it. -Harry Reads alot and often goes to the Library?

That's all I've got for now. You'd think If I could remember this much I could remember what the title was , or at least where I read it.

Anyone who can give me any information would be letting me sleep at night. I know it's a long shot but appreciate any help!


** Is that it: linkffn(10131469) ?

I pulled it from fanfiction.net's filter. The characters list that you have, gives a very narrow result (Just 7 fics):

*** Unfortunately it's none of the above. I'm thinking it may not have been published on FFN, but on another specialty Harry Potter Fanfiction site. I appreciate the attempt though!!

*** By some miracle I actually found it! Seriously, the series of events that got me to this story should have not logically happened under any circumstances!

Anyway, it was called "Candidus" by kuraokamiko. It used to be on FF dot net, although not anymore, but I found the yahoo group that has the files archived. [[https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/candidus/info?showJoinPopup=true]]

So yeah, enjoy! I'm seriously still in shock that I even found this thing...
