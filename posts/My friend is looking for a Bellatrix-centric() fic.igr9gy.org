:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Here's his description of the fic:

#+begin_quote
  From what I remember it was about Bellatrix still believing in pure blood supremacy but not agreeing with Voldemort's agressive ways so she fought together with the order

  Them it starts on Harry's their year I think

  Third*

  Cause Albus hires her for dada teaching in hopes she breaks the curse

  From what I remember of the tags she and Harry have a relationship like mother and son and eventually she has one with voldie

  I think it was on AO3

  But it may have been in ff as well
#+end_quote

Does it ring a bell to anyone?

EDIT: More info:

#+begin_quote
  Btw, the pov is from Harry

** This doesn't follow the second part of the fic description but Delanda Est is a fairly popular fic w/ Bellatrix

*** Can't really say that fic followed the first part of the description either. That Bellatrix was purely mercenary and didn't care what you had in your blood vessels so long as you were being useful.

Not to mention it was fairly badly written and had plotholes galore.

**** Well Delenda Est is the fic that started allot of Tropues I regard to the enchanting mis Lestrange And it's not that badly written.
