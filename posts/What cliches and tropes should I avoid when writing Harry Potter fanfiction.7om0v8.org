** Just be careful with limitations. Everything has a limit - polyjuice, amortentia and veritaserum are the main overused ones. They're not readily available without a potions master and they are illegal - at least to an extent. Charms are also often over used. Especially glamours - something I myself am guilty of. Basically, I'm just saying that you always need to remember that everything has limits. You can push them, but don't break them. Find another way.

** I dislike the trope that wizards and witches are incompetent and have failed because they don't study magic 24/7. Fan-fiction authors seem to think /anyone/ would want to do that, given the option.

People in general are content with the status quo and will take the path of least resistance. For example, you don't work your ass off to be a millionaire, you do your job, then come home and watch Netflix.

It's the same thing with Magic. Learn enough to get through school, perhaps find a niche area you're talented at/enjoy. Get a job, a partner, find some hobbies - perhaps have some guilty magical pleasures on the side. Sure you're not the quickest to draw your wand, you'd need 10 minutes prep beforehand to go more than 10 seconds in a duel - I mean, you're no /Dumbledore/. All you're glad about is that the world is peaceful and that horribly powerful wizard Voldemort is no more - thank Potter, right?

I find it immensely enjoyable when a story has a grounded quality to it. You can still have insane magic and battles and stuff, but recognizing that these situations are /so far out of the norm/ heightens them within that story.

Perhaps write a few "slice of life" stories of people who didn't have crazy success in their life or weren't involved in the main HP story. Just some guy who graduated Hogwarts, has a few friends through his hobby of herbology which lets him travel around the world. He's met some interesting characters. They have meet ups where they show off their more interesting specimens and some have really crazy properties. Writing stuff like this will let you explore different sort of experiences people might have in the HP world, you can then pick and choose ones which are most relevant for your novel.

This, to me, is very interesting. Because when you have a grounded, ordinary character, then drop them into some predicament, you get to find out what they are made from and elevate them as characters. Enough of this "heir of Merlin" nonsense that I see about - make a character work for their damn fame, for a change.

** Canon rehashes. I know the original well enough, please come up with something new and different.

For instance, in fem!Harry worlds, with a made up series of books about the girl-who-lived, many girls in the canon age group would have a strong female role model to lookup to (even it the books were completely fictional). Also, at age 11, many boys are still in the girls are gross stage and wouldn't have big crushes on the girl who lived for a year or 2. The personalities and interactions with many of the kids in her year would skew a fair bit. That's just one example for one change. However, most of the time its just canon Harry with boobs doing exactly the same stuff, with possibly 12 extra paragraphs describing how she looks.

** I'd say watch out for the "I'm just using a canon spell/item logically" trope. Not only because it's quite unlikely that Harry (it's always Harry) would be the first wizard to try using it creatively, but because it's very easy to break the setting.

Take the Fidelius, for example. It's a canon spell, and in many stories, it's used to hide a house, or a secret. And yet, why wasn't that done in canon by anyone other than Dumbledore and the Weasleys? Why wouldn't have Voldemort used the spell to hide at least one Horcrux?

If there's a magical rite and law that allows you to accuse someone and he has to answer with the truth, or die, then why wouldn't anyone have used that before Harry stumbled upon it to get rid of the Death Eaters?

If you can wreck the economy by playing fast and loose with the exchange rate for Galleons and the gold price, why wouldn't anyone have done that before?

4 school student created a map that can tell exact location, true name of each person in Hogwarts. Nobody used it to create map of othet areas to keep track of people. If 4 Hogwarts student could do it, others should be able to do so too.

With so many plot holes in series one would think she had other things in mind.

First book:

Harry is abused and isolated. Shows no sign at any stage.

His introduction with magic world came from a wizard, who shouldn't have wand in first place, using magic to turn his cousin info a pig. Not to mention the idiocy of keeping a known murderer as holder of keys.

Having consistent headache in DADA, not even thinking about it once.

****** Uhh the first book was a typical rags-to-riches, so the MC is supposed to be living in that type of environment at the start. An example is Oliver Twist. And Harry clearly shows signs of his childhood; look at his reaction to getting Christmas gifts.

Dumbledore never believed Hagrid was a murderer. Hagrid literally gave Dudley a pig's tail. This isn't much of a plot hole.

I'm pretty sure Harry blames his headache on the fumes.

The mirror worked because Dumbledore designed it to only give the stone to someone who didn't want to use the stone. I don't see the plot hole here.

Honestly, if you wanted to talk about plot holes, time turners would be a far better topic. You're just spewing things from Book 1 you disagree with, not actual plot holes.

** When you are writing dialogue, you don't have to keep writing who said what. If it is a conversation between two people, you can write the dialogue so that the reader can figure which person is speaking which line. This way, you'll avoid doing what some writers do--coming up with stupid synonyms for the main characters. There was one story that kept using "the bushy haired witch said" or "the boy-who-lived said" instead of just using the names Hermione and Harry. The author was clearly sick of writing the characters names over and over again, but could have solved the problem by assuming the reader is smart enough to figure out who is saying what during extended dialogue.

** Generally speaking harems and the "Lord Potter" trope ruin a lot of fics because they add nothing to the plot. I mean, what exactly is the point of a harem? In the unlikely case that your romantic pairing is into threesomes then you can always pick someone else or even pay a professional. Want to shag that other girl? Get her hair and some Polyjuice to live out that fantasy. In most of the harem stories, the women become collectables for Harry, mindless shells that always say the same three lines. And in 99% of all Lord Potter stories, the author has no clue how politics work and all the title just become another collection for Harry to have.

The third thing to avoid is bashing. You can absolutely trash most characters while resorting solely to the canon works. There is no reason to make up some Death Eater Ron or Dark Lord Dumbledore plot. But why would you want to trash certain characters in the first place? Want Ron out of the picture? Then have Harry get mad at him for the Scabbers fights. Or for being a dick to Hermione during the Yule Ball. Or have them grow apart because Ron spends all his time with Lavender. No need to turn him into a sisterfucking moron (unless you need that for your +smut+ plot).

** Just avoid doing anything with overpowered Harry or doing too many cliches. Like cliches aren't a bad thing, it's just how you use them. Harry getting rich and taking action isn't a bad idea. It's just been done to death so you have to make it either really interesting or really good.

Don't waste time on subplots that go nowhere either. It's great if you want to write an epic then do it but don't just throw a subplot in and forget about it.

I would also suggest against over-powered Harry just because the story feels boring. Sure, it's fun every now and then but if I know that Harry is going to win everything it takes away dramatic tension and makes the Deatheaters look like rubes.
