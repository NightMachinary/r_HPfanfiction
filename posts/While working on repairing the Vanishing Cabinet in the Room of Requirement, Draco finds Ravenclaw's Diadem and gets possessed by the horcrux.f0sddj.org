** Well, he will get easily caught as the Golden Trio will note that Malmort ( or Volco) has stopped using the phrase, "My father will hear about this."

*** He was already trying to lay low and acting suspicious. Harry will continue trying to warn everyone in vain while everyone ignores him. During the duel in bathroom he will be crucioed then obliviated and left lying there.

"You are the 'Chosen One'? How pathetic! I will enjoy watching everyone lose hope as they learn their 'Chosen One' knows no magic. /Obliviate."/

When someone finally finds him unconscious; he will be rushed to the hospital wing where it will be found he was extensively tortured and might never wake up.

***** This is actually roughly the plot of a fic I am working on. Not the possession bit but the bathroom duel bit. How it would have gone down if Rowling did not give Harry the ability to cast a spell with a long incantation without knowing it's pronunciation or the wand movements while the other guy has already uttered half of a very short spell. Yeah I am still bitter about the number of already established rules were broken in this book.

Anyway basically Draco tortures and obliviates Harry. What next? That is what I am writing about.

**** According to canon, Bertha Jonkins' memory charm was broken by extensive torture via the Cruciatus, and I doubt Harry's friends ( especially Neville) torturing him to restore his personality.

***** Harry is closer to Neville's parents situation than Bertha Jonkins'. Malmort tortured him till his mind broke and obliviated anything that was left.

***** I do not want Draco to win but the Harry in HBP is no where near as good as he was in OOTP where he and five students he taught gave some of Voldemort's best death eaters a fight and even took down some of them while walking into an ambush and being outnumbered.

The moment from which I am writing the fic is the moment when Draco is trying to cast /Crucio/ on him. The incantation of /Crucio/ is much shorter than that of /Septumseptra./ Further more when Harry started the incantation Draco was already halfway through his spell. Harry did not know the spell's wand movement, pronunciation or any theory at all. He should have never been able to cast it. That was the whole point of DA in OOTP. I guess he could have dodged it but that is up in air as he was not able to do so in the graveyard in GOF.
