It seemed to get lost in the other post.

Comment here if you'd be interested in being a mod with: why, what you think you'd bring to the mod team and any ideas you have for improving the subreddit.


** I think I might be interested. I spend way too much time here for my own good. Also, I would finally get to pin the bot usage post so people know how to use it right off the bat.

Talking about pinned posts, perhaps some sort of pinned post linking to fanfiction reviews by genre would be cool...

For the mod team itself... Not sure how much I could bring to it. It's been doing fine so far (in terms of handling bad posts) - I actually can't remember the last time I thought "this post needs to be moderated" on this subreddit.

For the subreddit... I have ideas often, I guess. Mostly regarding pinned posts that would improve activity, discussion, and participation. Could also take suggestions for weekly "theme" posts, I suppose, and vote on them!

******* The visibility of the sticky depends on what kind of CSS a subreddit has. Background colours, sticky colours, text, all of it counts. This sub has mainly the basics though, so it should be quite visible.

The only real problem with a floating sticky is that after 6 months other people can't comment on it because the thread becomes archived. You'd have to remember to repost it. Again that's not really a problem but it is something that can easily slip the mind.

*** I second this. I too spend an inordinate amount of time on the community, and think that tusing truly cares about both fanfiction and our fanfiction sub, in addition to the value added by creating the bot, which is, let's be honest, kick-ass. How many people here have used the bot? How helpful has it been to be able to see words, completion, and author summaries without copying and pasting? If we are going to get a new mod, at least let it be someone who actually is involved in the community!

** I'd love to help out, I spend a slightly ridiculous amount of time here, love the community and want to try and help more people get into fanfiction.

As for what i'd bring, i'm here an awful lot so i'd be able to help keep an eye on things and i'm from Ireland and as far as i'm aware all the mods are either American or Canadian (also I glanced at your profiles to check this and apparently they're all really good cooks too...) so i'd cover a timezone that isn't atm. I've had modding experience before on a sub on an old account and my responsibilities there were basically promoting the sub, removing spam, organising events and monitoring the mod mail so I know I can do that well.

My main idea would be in that post I made and have since spent the last 24 hours planning (a slightly elaborate debating tournament). Other than that, the general rec thread that now exists I think I suggested [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3h81dy/anyone_else_think_we_should_have_a_thread_just_to/][here]].

In general i'd just like to get more discussion going and try and get people active through things like that tournament. (Which btw i'd love to still do even if i'm not a mod?)

Although like I said in the other thread I think with you in charge and [[/u/kemistreekat]] here now we probably don't need many mods but if you're looking help i'd love to give something back. :)

** Hi all,

I'm interested in becoming a moderator here! I've been on this subreddit for a while now and I believe it is a good place to both discuss and discover fanfiction amongst like minded peers (at least for me because I don't know anyone else that reads fanfiction). I've been an avid reader since 2007 and so I have knowledge of the past and have kept up with the evolution of the genres over the years. Some ideas to improve this subreddit might be to develop a thread that promotes helpful feedback on aspiring authors regarding their stories and maybe encourage those slightly hesitant to work to pick up the pen. Another idea may be to develop a repository of highly recommended fanfiction, suggested by the community, which will allow new viewers of the subreddit to quickly find some of the best works and hopefully develop their interest in fanfiction!

Thanks for your consideration.

**** Yeah I am actually, been lurking there for a long time. For all the good DLP brings to the community as a whole, there's a lot of negativity as well. For one, fanfiction is there for enjoyment, especially to the writers that put in their time and efforts. The overcritical nature of DLP is somewhat discouraging to me because it prevents someone from giving writing a go thinking, 'I'll never be able to write up to DLP's standard, so why risk getting flamed/shat on.'

If we can create an environment that is inviting, open, and encouraging for all potential contributors, then HP fanfiction as a whole may move forward instead of staying stagnant as it has been for the past few years.

**** DLP recommends some good fics but unfortunately they have a very "singular" taste and everything that differs from it gets a bad rating, even if it's good. I've found more good fics here than there, and zhiyu's idea is pretty good, [[/r/wormfanfic]] has something similar.

** Not an application, just an idea. I disagree with moon_potato's idea, not because hiring mods is a bad idea, but because I'd just suggest /a mod/ checking the box in the edit flair tab that allows users to 'assign their own link flairs'. Admittedly it wouldn't help with mobile, but for standard computer/IPad/Mac/Kindle users it could be much easier and reduce that particular workload.

Just a suggestion though, you don't have to roll with it haha.

Edit: Never mind.

** I've been a reader of HP fan fiction for many years now and have read many different ones. I've seen the best and worse of fan fiction from long novel length series to thousand word one shot teenage dreamland stories. I can moderate fairly and even be active in the sub with other subscribers and discuss what I like and how it compares with them. As for ideas for the sub, maybe a random story on the sidebar that changes every 10 minutes or so to help people find new things they may not know they liked.

** Hello,

I'm applying to be a mod to help the community in any way possible and to make the sub more transparent, so it can foster all the usual, fun content without any drama.

I believe I can bring a voice to the community as well as help the subreddit become an even better place to have discussions and feature content. I will be happy to help limit the amount of spam in the community as well as help implement the ideas stated in the next paragraph. I'm also really productive and detail-oriented and have quite a bit of free time on my hands. I also have some modding experience in other subreddits.

I have some ideas for the subreddit:\\
* *Wiki*: This idea had come up before but hadn't really worked out. I want to implement the wiki and curate the content on the sub. I believe I can do this if we gather a dedicated team, we can make lists of good content by category, pairing, etc. for the community to enjoy.\\
* *Author Panel:* I think we could have monthly or weekly panels with fanfic authors (AMA-like but regarding the author's stories and writing in general).\\
* *Writing Tips:* I think we could post writing tips for readers wanting to get into writing or for writers trying to get better.\\
* *Writing Prompts:* like challenges for the community (think of the Severitus challenge)\\
* *Guides:* Guides for writing and beginner readers of fanfiction. I remember when I started reading fanfiction around 5 years ago, and I was so confused on how to get to the good content.

I hope you find these ideas creative and something we can implement.

--------------

And a note regarding the recent moderation "scandal":

I did not post the question on an effort to defy the mods or anything. I was doing the survey and came across a new mod, and I was quite puzzled. I'm quite thorough in everything I do, so I looked into it some more. But I don't totally regret inciting the discussion because many good points came up.

But some hate came out as well, on [[/u/kamistreekat]], [[/u/CatholicGuy]] and on [[/u/denarii]]. I did not like this or condone it at all. [[/u/kamistreekat]] and [[/u/denarii]] did not do anything wrong, and it would be great to serve as mods along you both!

What I'm trying to say is, please view as any other candidate and be fair in my review.

Thanks.
