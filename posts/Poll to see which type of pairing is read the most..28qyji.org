** I don't care too much about the gender pairings as long as the pairing is between the right persons.

I've read both Sirius Black/Remus Lupin and Minerva McGonagall/Poppy Pomfrey, and the pairings seemed perfectly believable. The story with a gay Dudley Dursley was well enough written that I've read it twice now.

But Harry/Snape? No way. Neither can I suspend disbelief when it comes to Draco Malfoy with either Harry, Ginny or Hermione. I also find Ron/Hermione to be an unlikely pairing, canon or not.

*** Any McGonagall/Pomfrey links? I never even thought of that pairing, but I must admit, I'm intrigued.

** I honestly read het and slash about equally, though it varies by fandom (I read more slash Sherlock and more het Marvel Cinematic Universe, but HP is definitely half and half). I do wish that had been an option, because I really like both. Still, I'll be interested to see the results.

*** Yeah, I figured if I made it "select multiple options" most people would pick all of them. What did you end up picking?

**** I went with slash, because I do really enjoy it and figured it would be the less popular choice. I think that's kind of the standard in tests and surveys in the social sciences. If you're split between two options, you go with the less common one. Don't quote me on that, though.
