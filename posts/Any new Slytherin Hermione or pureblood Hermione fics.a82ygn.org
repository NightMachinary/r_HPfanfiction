  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch.

******** Harry kind of starts off with Ron's attitude at the beginning but he slowly starts to get better, Draco and Hermione are different but are a family is the most important thing type of character. And there is some conflict between the characters but I wouldn't call them antagonists of each other. The story mainly follows the books for the first two although I suppose you could consider Remus an antagonist in the third book, and the third book is where the story takes a somewhat major diversion from canon

********** I wouldn't say Ron is bashed too badly but I guess that depends on your definition of bashed, and there really isn't many post divergence antagonists other than the one when they get to year 3 which you'll find out if you read that far. Wouldn't want to ruin the surprise ;)

  What happens when a brain damaged Harry and a transgender Hermione both get sorted into Slytherin? Snape's not sure, but he thinks it's likely to be an interesting term. This story follows various first years through the trials of their first year.

  Aurora Sinistra spends most of her time watching the stars. She's no centaur, but she's better than Trelawney. In the summer of 1991, she has a plan redeem the reputation of Slytherin House, and maybe some of the people inside it. Recruiting Severus Snape to help her over a game of chess, the two teachers undertake a gambit of their own that leads the Boy-Who-Lived and the Brightest Witch of Her Age into Slytherin House and friendships with Draco Malfoy.However, there is something strange going on at the school. Can the three figure out what it is that Professor Quirrell is up to and stop it? How will the changes in House and friendships effect Harry's relationship with Dumbledore and the headmaster's plans?

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

*** I don't think [[/u/Dashtikazar]] deserves to be downvoted for recommending it, but it's worth noting a few things about this fic:

1. It has a lot of Dumbledore-bashing.
2. Hermione becomes extremely protective of Harry, for no clear reason.
3. I dropped the fic after yet another irrational and unnecessary sacrifice by Hermione on Harry's behalf, but another reader who didn't tells me that she eventually becomes a submissive to Tom Riddle.

  Hermione Granger knows she's not a good person. Disillusioned with life at only twelve years old; she is cynical, manipulative, ruthless and, above all else, a survivor. For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.  Main Pairing: Harry Potter/Hermione Granger/Tom Riddle
