A few years ago, I read a Harry Potter/Temeraire cross-over fic on fanfic.net. The fic was set during the fourth book when Harry is fighting the Hungarian Horntail during the tournament. At some point, something happens, and the two are taken to the Temeraire universe where Harry merges with the Horntail somehow (?), or at least they can communicate telepathically.

The story was incomplete when I read it, but it has been a couple years, so it may be complete by this point. I know it was definitely on fanfic.net, but I have already searched the Temeraire cross-over section and could not find it. I do not remember specific pairings or the length. Sorry this is so vague. Any help would be awesome!


** Could it be this one?

  Of course Harry had thought about it, how cool it would've been to be able to transform into a dragon, but... not like this.
