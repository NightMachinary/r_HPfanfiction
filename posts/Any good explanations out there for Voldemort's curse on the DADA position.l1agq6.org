Of course the best explanation is that JK didn't think the whole thing through but I was wondering whether you know of any fic that deals with the implications of Voldemort's curse on the DADA position or if you have any theories. First thing that doesn't make sense is why would he only curse the DADA position and not that of the Headmaster. Or if he wanted to really cause chaos, he would have put the same curse on the Minister for Magic position or on that of the head of the DMLE.

Another thing that doesn't sit right with me is the fact that Dumbledore never did anything about it. Sure, maybe Voldemort was really sneaky when he placed it and Dumbledore didn't notice, but after he went through several DADA teachers over the next few years, one may expect that he would have noticed a pattern. He would have at least looked into it and there are people whose profession is specifically to break curses. By the time Harry goes to school the rumor that the position is cursed is pretty widely spread throughout the magic world considering that few people want it.

Any thoughts?


** I think that you're misunderstanding why he put the curse on the position. It wasn't some strategic act of warfare intended to reduce the strength of enemy soldiers (even though many fics like to portray it that way). It was just Tom being petty because he couldn't get the job.

As for why he didn't curse any other positions once his reign of terror started, there simply wasn't a need to do so. If he wanted the Minister or the head of the DMLE dead, he would just kill them. Voldemort openly killing the head of the DMLE is a lot more effective at causing fear and chaos than him claiming responsibility for their affair being discovered or them catching a bad case of dragon pox or something.

And cursing the position of headmaster would just give Dumbledore more time and motivation to stop him. Especially if it decided to remove Dumbledore by convincing him to dedicate his full attention to the war effort. It's far better for Dumbledore to be kept busy in a very public way.

Dumbledore probably did try to have the curse removed at some point, since there is no reason why he wouldn't. It's not canon that the curse was tied to the Diadem, but it is the easiest explanation for why no one was ever able to find or stop the curse. It could also just be that Hogwarts is such a magical place with so many overlapping and interconnecting enchantments and magical effects that it became impossible to single out and remove one specific curse. We really don't know enough about how magic works to be able to say for sure.

*** I think you might be right. He brutally murders Amelia Bones and enslaves Pius. He also blackmails Fudge into resigning by destroying a bridge and kills Scrimgeour. And, yeah, Dumbledore was probably capable enough to identify if his position was cursed so the only reasonable conclusion is that the DADA position was cursed because he was being petty.

**** You reminded me of one other point I forgot to mention: the DADA curse was indiscriminate. If a minister or DMLE head ended up being incompetent, sympathetic to the cause, or easily controllable via threats, bribes, or the Imperius, then Voldemort would probably prefer to let them stay in that position for as long as possible.

** Reposting my earlier work:

It's my belief that the curse Voldemort put on the position is for the DADA professor to be confronted by his or her worst fears;

1st - Quirrel was devalued, used, and then thrown away. His death wasn't even investigated

2nd - Lockhart was forced into a do or die situation, revealed as a coward and huckster, then had his own Memory charm used against him

3rd - Lupin's lycanthropy was exposed and by losing control he threatened the lives of those closest to him

4th (a two-fer) - Moody is blindsided by a Death Eater and his identity/reputation used against his allies; Crouch Jr. kills his own father before he can prove his worth, misses his Master's resurrection and then gets Kissed by a Dementor

5th - Umbridge has her authority destroyed and then falls victim to half-breeds and creatures, because she was deceived by a muggleborn

- Harry also taught Defense; his relationship with Cho imploded, he was betrayed by someone trusted (Marietta Edgecombe), they all were caught by Umbridge with help from his hated rival (Draco), and he later lost the closest thing to a parent he had left (Sirius).

It's probably for the best that he and Ginny hadn't started dating yet.

6th - Snape is forced to choose his side, ruining his reputation with those he respects. He also has to kill Dumbledore, the one man who knows his true motivations

7th - the Carrows witness the fall of the Dark Lord and are captured and sent to Azkaban (a place they had avoided up til then). Amycus gets a dose of his Cruciatus from Harry.

In a sense, I see the Curse as an answer to the insult; Riddle felt he was the best possible candidate for the Defense position, and his curse would force any other contenders to prove their superior fitness for the position. It ends when he dies, but not because curses end with the death of the caster. It ends because he could no longer take the position.

*** Funny you say that. My thought was similarly in relationship with the Marauders. It's stated that the Potters escaped him three times before he finally caught up with them. I like to think that at some point they used their Animagi forms to elude him and escape him so he cursed them so that they will only experience freedom in their animal forms. James ends up dead while in hiding, Sirius is only truly free when he is in his dog shape, otherwise spending time in Azkaban or in his parents' house and Pettigrew is only free as a rat because as soon as his human form is revealed he runs to Voldemort who treats him for the rest of his life as little more than a slave.

** I think its a combo of the other two comments on here. It could have very well been an accident that happens when powerful magic users are experiencing extremely strong emotions.

It could also have been a byproduct of the horocrux in the room of requirement. A powerful magical object containing a bit of his soul and desires in a room that seems to have some control over most of the castle.

*** I like that theory. Diadem and curse were placed at the same time as well. First saw this in Wind Shear.

Another one I liked was in The House of Potter Rebuilt. The new DADA makes it a class project, all years, to brainstorm how the curse works. A couple Ravenclaws win, it turns out to be a bad luck curse powered by a taboo on the word 'professor'.

** A combination of things as listed. Another is even without fandom bashing, Dumbledore's canon personality includes a great deal of arrogance. He got better from the time of Grindelwald, but even so he keeps /everything/ to himself as he's the only one who can handle things, or such.

I can see him thinking if he can't find a curse, it must not really exist, it's just really bad luck.

** I think 'curse' has two distinct meanings in Harry Potter. The first is like in 'The Killing Curse' - a spell, cast by wand, with malintent. But the second meaning is more in line with the old school type of curse: "any expressed wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall or attach to one or more persons, a place, or an object".*

I see it as a type of 'old magic'. There are no magical words or wand-waving. No sure fire way to invoke the magic. And no guaranteed effect. It's simply an expression of your malicious intent on the world, and the universe itself changes to make it come true.

And because it wasn't a simple spell, there is no simple remedy. You can't /finite/ this kind of curse, or 'trick' it by changing the name of the position. It's just now a fundamental part of how the world works.

â€‹

*as an aside, I expect the two are related. Many of the most common old school curses, like cursing someone you truly hate to die, were studied extensively and eventually someone figured out a simple and reliable way to call on magic to make it happen. Thus the Killing Curse was born.

*** Well I would think you are right because curses seem to attach to physical objects, locations and even to abstract things such as job openings. However the story hints at the fact that in this case, Voldemort used his wand at the point when he left the office (Harry thought that Voldemort was trying to curse Dumbledore when he saw the memory). So if that's the case, some intent concentrated through the wand was definitely there. But I suppose that, as other users said, the purpose of the curse was not born out of some strategic thinking but more out of pettiness (I mean even with proper DADA training, few wizards could hold their ground against Voldemort by themselves). He is kind of like the evil witch who sets the curse from the sleeping beauty because she wasn't invite at the princess's birthday feast.

*** Honestly... I don't know where either tropes came from. My question stemmed from that trope that he was trying to weaken his adversaries but as one user mentioned, I think they're right and Voldemort was just being petty. I also don't think he is really crazy... he is supposed to be actually quite calculated and secretive. Does he suffer from megalomania and a god complex that make him overconfident? Absolutely. Is he a sociopath with extreme sadistic tendencies and complete disregard for human life? Yes. But he is not the cuckoo type of crazy. He is not like the Joker. In fact he does seem quite well calculated and sober to his surroundings. He only loses his cool when it comes to Harry.

** Canon seems to imply that the act of refusing the Defence Against the Dark Arts Professorship to a dark wizard as skilled (powerful) as Lord Voldermort established a curse on the position.

Consider the fact that even when his power was broken on October 31, 1981, the curse remained active. It was only with Voldemort's death that the curse was lifted.

Indeed, it is interesting if this were the case as it establishes that actions have significance beyond what they would for Muggles. Lily and Harry could provide protection to others with their sacrifice whereas Voldemort (a selfish man obsessed with immortality) being rejected from a position he deeply desires could result in a curse on the position.

There are other instances where actions are more significant for magicals than muggles.

I'll end with this quote from DH "Dumbledore had at least taught Harry something about certain kinds of magic, of the incalculable power of certain acts."

** This series has breaking the DADA curse as a subplot: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22220911]])

- The curse intensifies negative emotions towards the DADA professor so the cause of the incumbent's death or resignation varies and looks natural in isolation. As it affects other people it can't be detected by looking at the DADA professor.
- The curse doesn't happen every single year.
- The curse is anchored to a physical object in the RoR, where only the elves and Voldemort know how to access the room.
- Parseltongue acts as a 'backdoor' to Hogwarts defenses.
