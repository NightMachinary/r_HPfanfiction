You are a Death Eater who has been tasked by Lord Voldemort to kill the Muggle Prime Minister. You must not be caught, and you must not raise suspicion. Lord Voldemort has given you 3 months to accomplish your task.

How do you do it?

** Voldy's original reign idea: Ever read Patriot games?

That.

(Disillusion self. Get into Parliament. Imperious the chief of staff to learn Thatcher's or Callaghan's typical travel itinerary. Leak that itinerary to IRA. Pay a few of them to do the following: When the PM is being driven down an unsecured street, use RPGs to take out the lead and chase cars, then machine gun the hell out of it. Has the added benefit of getting the Brits occupied with the Irish and distracting them too)

Voldy return during 1990s? Fidelius a dirty suitcase bomb. Send it in, detonate next to Major's office. Have a middle eastern terrorist (Bin Laden?) imperious cursed to make a public claim of responsibility.

With imperio, there are no limits to how broken the world could be.

Both options assume death eater does not equal "technophobic backwards idiot" however.

** I research a Muggle businessman who is rich enough to be notable but not prominent enough to attract any kind of Ministry attention. I place him under the imperius and have him make a large donation to the Prime Minister's political party on the understanding that it comes attached to a meeting in person with the PM. Before they meet, I give the businessman a weapon enchanted to evade Muggle detection methods. When they shake hands, the Muggle businessman kills the PM before finishing themselves off.

Reasoning: I figure the trick is to avoid coming up against the Auror assigned to protect the PM, which means no direct magical assault. The best way to avoid triggering the suspicion of the PM's magical guard is to use a non-magical access point.

*** I like the businessman starting point, but the enchanted weapon feels like too much, have the businessman invite the PM on a private jet, with tampered engines. Ideally use something that could reasonably be overlooked during maintenance.

**** Are you sure the PM's security detail would allow such a detail to be overlooked on a plane that the PM is to fly on, assuming they allow him to fly on the private jet of some random businessman at all? Even if he made a sizable donation to the PM's party, the PM's security detail is probably quite stringent on whose plane the PM flies on.

Wait for the PM to leave the house. Apparate/portkey your bomber onto the roof while you're disillusioned. Let him drop onto the people and activate the bomb.

If mission is a failure, rinse and repeat.

** simple cast imperio on a petrol truck driver, and run him over while making sure the driver kills himself with a live grenade he is holding. Minister dies and the jarring allows the live grenade to drop from his hand or he does it anyway so even if he misses the explosion of the grenade and the tank kills him anyway.
