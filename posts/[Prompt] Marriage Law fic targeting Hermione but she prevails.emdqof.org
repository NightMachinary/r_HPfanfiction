So, I've seen fics where Voldemort or Draco manipulates marriage law to force Hermione into essentially sexual slavery.

What if we take that premise, that js Voldemort is in control of the government and they dig up an ancient Marriage Law with magical components to force all mudbloods to essentially be slaves to purebloods, and Draco uses this law on Hermione. However the twist is that in their idiocy they miss a loophole/mistake, essentially the reason this law is old and obscure and not used anymore.

That mistake is that the Master in the Marriage is the more magically powerful wizard or witch, not necessarily the one who forces it on the other or, as sexist pigs would assume, automatically the wizard.

Essentially, I imagine Draco cackling about how much he's gonna enjoy this and then when the seal is complete, it's revealed that Hermione is the one in control because she's more powerful magically.

TL;DR: Can you tell that I really like Hermione and I'm pissed at those marriage law fics?


** "Dad?"

"Yes honey?"

"Can I borrow grandpa's shotgun? It's for science reasons"

"Sure pumpkin. The cartridges are in the cupboard."

"Thanks daddy!"

~***~

Hermione Granger has had enough. The imbecilic wizarding government went to far this time! Some inbred, simpleton, shitstain, horseshit peddler in the wizengamot thought it was a good idea to force muggleborn girls into marriage contracts. At the age of 12!

No, enough was enough.

Gingerly she went to work. The weapon needed to be modified of course. But she was the brightest witch of her age and so she was up to the task. Eagerly she started drawing out schematics.

The double barreled weapon would have a permanent geminio charm etched in the chamber ensuring infinite ammo with a fire rate as quick as her finger. This will produce a massive amount of heat though so a cooling charm needed to be etched on the barrels. Recoil and weight also needed to be dealt with. Lastly the regular buckshot cartridges just didn't pack enough oomphe. After long deliberation she decided to enchant the cartridges with cutting charms for maximum penetration.

She did so like the irony.

After testing the weapon in the backyard she found it to be adequate to her needs. It was time for the final preparations.

~***~

"Mum? Can I borrow your lipstick?"

"Sure dear. Has a nice boy caught your eye?"

"He sure did mum!"

"That's lovely dear."

When Hermione sat down in front of her mothers vanity mirror she started applying her war paint. Two dark red streaks on each of her cheekbones and that was enough. And yet there was something missing.

She started looking around the room and her eyes fell on one of her dad's ties. A bright red one. It would do. She tied it around her forehead so her hair wouldn't obscure her eyes. She was ready.

"Mom I'm going out. I'm gonna overthrow the evil wizarding government! I'll be home late!"

"Have fun with your new friends dear! Do you want me to leave dinner in the fridge?"

"Yes please!"

~***~

The floo deposited Hermione in the atrium. On her chest she wore a shiny badge that said 'asskicker.' She was carrying an lengthy package wrapped in cloth. Placing the package under her arm she went to talk to the young lad at the reception area.

"Excuse me could you direct me towards the wizengamot chamber? One of the lords requested this package."

"Of course. Just ride that elevator over there all the way to the down. And it'll be the last room at the end of the hall."

"Thank you." she smiled at him turned around and skipped her way towards the elevator.

"What an oddly dressed little girl."

~***~

"And in short I would just like to add that fruit should not be exempt from taxation during the-"

Lord Malfoy was interrupted from finishing his sentence by a soft but insistent knocking at the door.

"I wonder who that could be. Mr Nott? Be dear and open the door would you?"

"Of course sir."

When Mr. Nott opened the door he saw a young girl holding a strange device.

"I've got a message for the wizengamot from the muggleborn population."

He laughed a little."Yeah? Let's hear it?"

Hermione pulled the trigger blowing a large gaping hole where his heart used to be. Large meaty chunks of Mr' Nott sprayed over the wizengamott's floor.

First there was a beat of silence as Mr'Nott collapsed. Then pandemonium.

People flung their papers in the air as they panicked trying to hide behind stately looking tables, spells where flying every which way and Hermione just kept pumping lead into anyone who came close.

BOOM BOOM BOOM. With every pull of the trigger the wizarding world became a little less pure.

After only ten seconds of carnage the wizengamot was no more. There was only the sound of death rattles of the slowly dying and the whimpering of a coward in hiding.

Hermione followed her ears and found the wretched creature with his wand arm amputated.

"...Why?" He asked with tears streaking down his cheeks.

Covered in blood and gore Hermione raised her shotgun and pointed it right between his eyes.

"Freedom." She replied, and blew his head of.

~***~

"Mum I'm home!"

"Hermione can you come here for a second? We need to discuss something with you."

Hermione entered the kitchen to find her parents dressed in big fluffy bunny suits at the dinner table holding hands.

"Hermione... This isn't easy for us to admit... Hermione.... Your parents... That is to say your father and I... We're furries Hermione. We have been for a long time and we would like it if you could respect our life choices."

"W-what? What do you mean?"

"We like to cuddle with strangers in our bunny suits Hermione. It's not weird."

"Bu-bu- but. Why? How? ...Who? What?"

After a moment of silence Hermione's parents started laughing.

"O my god! You should see the look on your face! It's absolutely priceless! O dear, O dear. I can't believe we got you this good. Especially after your own little prank."

Mum pointed at the calender. "Happy april fools day Hermione." Kissed her on her bloody brow, and walked of.

Hermione blinked.

********* Haven't seen this one before... I see what you mean about Hermione being "strong but not ridiculously so". So many bad cliches, though...

The author chose to give Harry an even bigger power-up; it's a pretty common thing to do (e.g., HPMOR and /Harry Crow/), and it grates. I think that we have this social (evolutionary psychological?) conditioning that a man cannot romance a woman taller, higher-earning, higher-achieving, physically stronger, or, as applied to Potterverse, magically more capable than himself. (Higher social status is more acceptable, but that's something that is a function of their respective social circles, rather their personal merit.)

Pointless Ron-bashing is pointless. Yes, I know, he ended up with the female lead in canon. It's not his fault, and it's certainly not the fault of the character in your (general "you" here, not you personally) fic.

Also, I can understand why Hermione in Gryffindor wouldn't have many friends. But, a Ravenclaw!Hermione ticks all the boxes for the perfect Ravenclaw, and in this fic, she is apparently "glamorous" as opposed to "frumpy", yet she doesn't have any friends except for Luna.

Sorry for the rant.

********** Some of your criticism is legit, especially where Harry is also given a power boost. But honestly? I still love the story and can't wait for the next chapter, cliches and all.\\
I love this Hermione, I love that it's supposedly a fluff/smut story with no Voldemort. I love the way they reworked the magic system. I love all the other interactions. I love how well-written it is (and let's face it, a lot of fanfic as much as I appreciate all the hard work poured into it, is sometimes terribly written). I love that they seem to be slow-burning.

*********** Different strokes for different folks.

My tolerance for Ron-bashing is pretty low at this point. Also, the opening scene---for me, this juxtaposition of a flighty, flustered, ineffectual, impulsive female lead with a confident, capable, composed, and suave male lead who "rescues" her from unwelcome advances of another man... It's like one big pile-up of sexist stereotypes and tropes. And, it's exacerbated by the fact that the characters' canon personalities are closer to the reverse of the above-described.

I can understand and respect people (of every gender) who like this type of dynamic, but there's /got/ to be a way to write this sort of meeting that at least gives the female lead some dignity. Or, is the indignity a part of the romance? I am certainly not a part of the target audience for this sort of fiction, so I can't say.

** I wrote this quick one shot for you, hope you like it :)

Hermione Granger has always been smart. This is something that has been common knowledge amongst the magical population for years; it has been evident in her marks and the way she handled herself and her friends during the war. She's also incredibly lucky at times. Therefore, it should not come as a surprise that when calamity strikes, Hermione Granger is the one that comes out on top.

-6 years after the Battle of Hogwarts-

Draco is annoyed. He knows that there has to be some way to get one over on the annoying mudblood that ruins all of his plans! That goal is what has him digging through the dusty archives of the Ministry's Archives Department. He's annoyed and frustrated, but determined as well. He's been down here for hours looking for something - ANYthing - useful.

Finally he makes it to the marriage section. He had avoided this section from the beginning because the idea of marrying a mudblood makes him shudder in revulsion, but at this point he's out of options. He spends the next hour looking over the laws, finally happening across a promising hint about a law that was passed in the early thirteen hundreds. He keeps it in mind so that he can look through his family library later, since the file doesn't give specifics. He continues on through to the end of the archives, but finds nothing else.

Draco heads to Malfoy Manor so that he can continue his search. It takes three days to find what he's looking for, but once he makes the discovery, the frustration of days past vanishes. It's perfect!

--------------

Hermione knows something is wrong the moment she walks into the day's Wizengamot session. She's surrounded by smirks and snickers and she knows it's bound to be a hard day.

It's an hour and a half in when Draco Malfoy stands. She rolls her eyes at the pomp and dramatics he engages in to introduce himself, but takes pause when his eyes meet hers. They're full of malicious glee and she knows this isn't going to go well.

The more he speaks, the angrier she gets. She's seeing red as he uses phrases such as “magically enforced subservience” and “bound as a mistress” and such. Apparently this archaic law was never repealed, and just fell out of use for whatever reason. It stipulates that should a muggleborn be unmarried after the age of twenty one, an unmarried Lord or Lady may make a bid for said muggleborn. Unless a more powerful house's Lord or Lady contests the match, the muggleborn is magically bound to fulfil their duty to the wizarding world by tying themselves to the Lord or Lady.

Unfortunately, the only families more powerful than the Malfoy family are those of Potter and Black, and Harry is out of the country and unreachable for the next six months. The Wizengamot decides that the binding ceremony will be that afternoon, so as to prevent her from running. She curses them for their sudden ability to think logically.

--------------

The ceremony is short and requires no words from Draco or Hermione. It's all over quickly, and it is immediately obvious to the surrounding purebloods that something is wrong. Draco is trying to order Hermione about, but... well, nothing happens. He does eventually get on her nerves enough for her to snap at him to “Shut up, Malfoy!”

The crowd is stunned as his teeth audibly click together at her order. Even Hermione pauses for a moment in surprise. Her eyes narrow as she gives another order - for science, of course. No, she couldn't have made him do something else, punching himself in the bollocks was the only option. Really.

--------------

Hermione reads through the law that the ponce had found, and snorts in amusement when she finds that it is the more magically powerful individual that takes precedence. The Wizengamot had decided that it didn't work because it was obviously written by ancient ‘mudbloods' trying to take over the wizarding world by trapping their heirs. Hermione doesn't feel the need to enlighten them, seeing as they aren't likely to try again thinking what they do. It was rather satisfying making Malfoy transfer everything - including the Malfoy family Headship - to her.

She does eventually come to the conclusion that she's okay with ‘owning' Malfoy, and decides she can make an exception in this case. She does free and then rehire (with pay) the house elves in the Malfoy family employ.

She and Harry have a good laugh over it when he returns to Europe, and everyone (except Malfoy) lives happily ever after.

THE END.

  When a group of polyjuiced Death Eaters capture Ginny and Hermione, Voldemort decides to use a bit of archaic magic to turn the Muggle-born into a prize for one of his faithful. WARNING: Ginny is 16, the legal age of consent in the UK, at least at the time this fic was begun. I chose not to use the underage archive warning because I think that would give a distorted idea of what this fic is about and how it will present things. YMMV.

** I am not sure I like the whole "magical strength" implication, but I can see it being a sort of contest of wills, along the lines of Priori Incantanem in GoF. Maybe the marriage ceremony binds the wills of the partners in a similar manner, and the one with the stronger will (whatever that means) can impose on the other.

  That mistake is that the Master in the Marriage is the more magically powerful wizard or witch, not necessarily the one who forces it on the other or, as sexist pigs would assume, automatically the wizard.
#+end_quote

I wouldn't attribute such an expectation to sexism---since magicals are more egalitarian historically than muggles---but I wouldn't be surprised if they assumed that a Muggleborn would be weaker than a Pureblood.

That said, I can imagine a number of social forces (and maybe evolutionary psychology, depending on how much of that is true) that would lead the male spouse to dominate the female spouse in most marriages.

Of course, between Hermione and Draco, there would be no contest.

**** Both of them exist IRL and are acceptable ways to have a child, such as for same-sex or infertile couples (as examples). I'm not sure why they were brought up for this prompt.

***** Most of these marriage fics or contracts have clauses that add obligations for children and/or a heir.

How insulting would that be to House Malfoy if Hermione went and got the new heir through a muggle technique? Without any of the "fun"?

****** That's actually a hilarious thought. I assume in some of these, there are ways to either ensure that the bride remains faithful or to verify whether she has cheated, and both of these options would get around that. So knowing that she has remained "faithful" to him, and still there's a ginger baby.

****** Ehhhh that's not as vindictive as I want to see. It'd be similar to stories where she basically gives a middle finger to everything by either starting a revolution or being Slytherin as fuck surviving the rape-enabling-fic. I've read that before. Still dislike it.

What I want to see is basically a complete and utter "fuck you Malfoy, you're my little fuckin bitch now" and Malfoy never gets the chance to do anything to her
