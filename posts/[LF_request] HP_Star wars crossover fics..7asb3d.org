Especially looking for well written and updated within this year. Harem/smut is also ok.

[Edit: Thank you all for sharing! /These are the stories I was looking for/ :) ]


** linkffn(The Stag and the Dragon) is complete and pretty good, despite a few moments that stretch disbelief towards the end.

  Crossover and OoTP AU. It's Harry's fifth year, and a desperate Dumbledore hires a new Dark Arts teacher who might prove to wreak more havoc than Umbridge ever could... Darth Vader.

**** The problem is that that story is utterly boring. Almost nothing happens at all. Hell, it took like 50,000 words just for them to launch the ship and then travel to Kashyyyk with no relevant information being given to the reader at all. It's just thousand and thousands of words of formulaic filler.

Harry does something miraculous his magic that everything thinks is impossible and then everyones reaction is then described in detail. Or, Harry says something profound that just happens to apply perfectly to the current situation, and adds in a snide remark at the end. Then, every character reacts, and all of their reactions pretty much just rehash what Harry just did for the next few thousand words. Ahsoka reacts, usually in Harry's favor, since he took her in when the Jedi cast her out.. There there's a long drawn out introspective from Aayla, who is a bit confused and caught between sides, but she had a premonition about her future so she follows through. And then there's the Jedi council, whom are the surrogate for everything that Harry put up with while in the wizarding world, who themselves are split on the issue so ultimately it's just a bunch of wasted words as well. And this cycle just repeats and repeats and repeats.

MEN

I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For is shit. It flanderizes the Star Wars universe, makes a bunch of stupid-ass Harry Potter decisions, is utterly predictable in every way and got infinitely worse when it switched from Ahsoka-centric to Harry-centric.

** Aside from the ones already mentioned, there are only a couple of others I can even tolerate. The major downside to them is that they seem to have been abandoned, however what is there is interesting at least. The first is linkffn(Equilibrium by Surarrin), where Harry bumps into Ahsoka just after she leaves the order and drags her into his weird life. The second is linkffn(Discordant by Heather Sinclair), where Harry helps Asaaj kill Dooku early on and generally makes a nuisance of himself. Finally there is linkffn(Last Second Savior by plums), it is the only one I really still hold out hope for updating, as he is something of a beta/muse for a couple of other reasonably well known authors. His story is based off another, linkffn(Sword and Magic by bluminous8), though I found his to be a better version, it is at a slow boil. It is supposedly going to be a harem story eventually, but its not really close at the moment. Other than Tsu Doh Nim and kathryn518s story, I really have found nothing worth mentioning from these fandoms crossing.

  It wasn't the bright and shiny Jewel of the Galaxy you've all seen on the HoloNet. Harry's story started in the Underworld, a kilometer below the upper levels of Coruscant, where you never walk the streets alone, especially if you don't have a blaster hanging by your side. He left for a little while, but now it's called him back, whether he realizes it or not.

  Ahsoka feeling abandoned, betrayed and disillusioned with the Jedi Order, decided to part ways. She left to find meaning and purpose in her life. She never expected it to come in the form of an enigmatic green eyed young man who had more than a passing interest in the past. She never imagined that learning about the history of the galaxy could be so dangerous---or magical.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

  Based on The Galactic War challenge by Belgrath on DZ2's forums. During the Battle at the Department of Mysteries, Harry Potter is sent to the Star Wars universe. Arriving two years before Attack of the Clones, this is Harry's story as he grows through the Clone Wars and his return home. An eventual H/Hr, it will develop after harry's return. Not sure which genres to call this one.
