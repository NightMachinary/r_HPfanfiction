** I am so sorry for not following your request. But there will come a day when linkffn(Grow Young With Me by Taliesin19) is completed. Please save it to your favorite stories or your follows and when that story is completed, you will be enthralled with my favorite OC character of all-time, Abigail Waters.

If you can't wait and dive in now, I promise you will love it and you'll just have to sit and wait until it is updated again. The story is not abandoned but author has been very slow to update the last few chapters. Even still. very much worth the wait.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

**** Good I definitely consider it one of the better ones out there right now, just frustrating it gets updated so slow. But hey, author's probably got other shit going on...

I feel the same with Northumbrian, who you've probably heard of, but she's got Strangers at Drakeshaugh going right now that gets updated about once every other month or so and it's very good. linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh by Northumbrian). It's got another good OC character who is a muggle. Maybe I have a thing for muggles getting a little peek behind the curtain and see how they interact with wizards. Northumbrian has done that a couple times with characters and usually does it very well... I also saw that The Changeling was recently updated, and that's a very good one about Ginny in Slytherin that I thought was well-written. linkffn(The Changeling by Annerb). Not along the lines of my obsession with OC muggle characters, but it's another good WIP that does not get updated very often. I have yet to read the newest chapter for this one but I'm sure it's fantastic.

Just in case you want a couple more that I thought were pretty fun. Currently reading about 8-9 WIPs that I think are all pretty good reads if you need any more suggestions. Maybe a couple of them have fallen off a bit but I'm invested so I want to see them to the end. But most are pretty good.

****** If you're not familiar with that author's work she has a lot of finished work that is really great to read through. She's dedicated to canon and writes her story around that, but I've thought she's done some great post-Hogwarts writing, a lot about immediately after, then Harry as he develops his career as an auror, and really a lot of different fun looks into their lives that seems to fit in well with the canon universe.
