While studying the Salem Witch trials in History of Magic, Harry comes across a passage which mentions a witch hunter who went by Inquisitor Dursley. The passage quoted him saying, "these freaks have no place in society and will need to be purged with fire"

Shocked, he traces this man's history and descendents, already knowing what he will find.....

  “Well, that's rather anticlimactic,” Harry said, after reading that Inquire-After-the-Lord's-Wisdom Dursley died without having any children. Crazier coincidences had happened before, he supposed.

** Wouldn't it be more likely for him to be part of the English or Scottish witch trials?

*** It really would. The Dursleys don't strike me as the sort to have emigrated from, then re-immigrated to, England.

*** The Salem Witch trials happened while America was still an English colony, so totally possible for an inquisitor to have returned to England after. I made sure to check that before the post.

**** There were fewer inquisitors at Salem than during the English trials, because there weren't /any/ inquisitors or witch-hunters around. Trials were brought forward by individual civilians to the town magistrates, who would then launch a public examination of the witches.

While the inquisition existed during this time, it wasn't actually present in Salem due to the fact that the inquisition was a Catholic institution. The Salem Witch trials were instigated by Puritan extremism. The Catholic church's influence in the New World was very small. Additionally, any outside English influence would have been Anglican, since the country had left the Catholic Church in 1534. The Salem trials were 158 years later. By 1689 Protestantism was overwhelmingly the popular religion in England, with the English Bill of rights only applying to Protestants. So it would be very hard to get an English Inquisitor in the 1690s.

If you'd like for Dursley to have a similar role in a witch trial, he would have to be Witch-Hunter*, unless he was a member of the Catholic Inquisition, in which case he would be an inquisitor. Of course, this leaves the same issue, as there were no witch-hunters in Salem. There were witch-hunters present at the trial of the Pendle Witches in 1612, so this could work.

*Possibly also witchfinder, in the vein of Matthew Hopkins, the self-proclaimed Witchfinder General.

Yes it was. They had to be rich, or to have a rich employer, but people most certainly did.

****** You're right, but also wrong, but mostly right. I'm not quite sure why I included it. Gonna remove it.

Found out why. It was evidence for a different argument, but I went a completely different way with my line of reasoning. I'm bad at revision apparently.

** Not that, but I like the New England Puritan HP fanfiction “[[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=288707][With the Devil by celticbard]]”. Whole area of the historical fanfiction is seriously underdeveloped.
