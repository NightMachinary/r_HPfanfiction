So I've been reading ff for some time now, and I think I've exhausted most well written stories fitting into my extremely strict criteria. It doesn't matter if they're one-shot or novel length, just need some good ones. A few of what I've read, so you can get a general idea of what I like:

- Unatoned
- Blindess
- The Real Memory
- HPMOR
- Dimension Hopping for Beginners
- A Black Comedy
- The Prisoner's Cipher
- Elizium for the Sleepless Souls
- The Unforgivign Minute
- Where in the World is Harry Potter Trilogy
- Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time
- The Strange Disappearance of Sally Anne Perks
- The Serpent and The Mirror
- All Through The Night

What I don't like:

- Slash
- nextgen
- SnapementorsHarry
- HPGW & RWHG
- unrealistic portrayals or changes in characters without good explanation (believable changes are fine though)
- incompetent Dumbledore (mistaken Dumbledore is fine, but stupid and dumb Dumbledore is not something I like)

I realize I'm being *EXTREMELY* picky here, but I'd really appreciate any inputs and suggestions of fanfics.

Cheers! PS: One more thing I should mention but forgot...I don't like crossovers, and I don't like OC's either...sorry, and thanks!

Edit 1: Incomplete but awesome fics reallly piss me off, unless they're getting updated.. for eg: Lost Time (Amerision), On The Way to Greatness....awesome but incomplete.


** Linkffn(Circular Reasoning; What You Leave Behind) are among the best fics in the fandom and both are well written.

Now excuse me while I'm smugly condescending towards the OP for considering MoR to be well written. /cough/ lol /cough/

** Linkffn(Resurrexit) seems to fit in with your criteria. It's up there for one of the best-written fics in the fandom.

Seeing as you liked /The Unforgiving Minute/ and /Elizium for the Sleepless Souls/, I'd suggest checking out Voice of the Nephilim's other fics linkffn(Concentric Wavelengths; Sole Survivor (Nephilim)). They're both oneshots, but still very good.

** Some really great suggestions already by WetBananas, though I don't agree with them all. To add, nonjon does great comedy so if you want more, linkffn(Seventh Horcrux) is the only one I know that's on par with his quality. BajaB's linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff) is decent too.

Some interesting Snape fics (not mentoring Harry) are linkffn(A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles) and linkffn(I Know Not, and I Cannot Know--Yet I Live and I Love).

A few long fics that explore Percy and Dudley's potential as characters, as well as a couple Harry/Luna fics that are well written imo linkffn(6862426, 4800046, 3493409, 5136938).

And finally a bunch of one-shots of varying length that are some of the best I've read linkffn(9526039, 7658662, 5987922, insurgere, 5670953, 4152700).

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

  In canon, healers and mediwitches were seemingly spared from the predations of the Death Eaters during both Blood Wars. St. Mungo's would have been a very soft target, but it stood inviolate. One patient was attacked, but the hospital and it's staff were spared. The question is, why? What could have kept mad killers in check? As with a great many other things, Poppy knew.

** linkffn(9704180) is unfinished, but in my opinion is the best piece of fanfiction there is. It avoids what you don't like (with the exception of once necessary and believable OC) and is well written and hard to stop reading. I still hope that kathryn518 decides to at least update it some time in the future.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.
