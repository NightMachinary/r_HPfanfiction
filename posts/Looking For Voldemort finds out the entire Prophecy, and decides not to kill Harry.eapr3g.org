I'd rather Harry be on the Light Side if possible, but am fine with him being dark, if he's not evil.

I'd rather not have Dumbledore and/or Weasley bashing.

Would rather not have Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Edit: The Horcruxes can or don't have to be part of the story, I don't care either way.
