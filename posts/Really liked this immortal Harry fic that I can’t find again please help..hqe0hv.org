:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The fic starts with Harry getting kissed by dementors on the train and Dumbledore makes him immortal. Then he goes and kills Umbridge to make a statement about how he isn't a doormat


** Ahhhh, casual murder. Truly the best way to prove one isn't a doormat. Unless it's death-by-tripping, in which case one may in fact /be/ a doormat.

Seriously though, this sounds amusing. Hope it gets found.

** Sounds a bit like Partially Kissed Hero, but it's years since I read it. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4240771/1/Partially-Kissed-Hero]]

** I remember one that was a crossover with Naruto, seems abandoned though and don't remember the name. Try searching on the crossover section of ffn one with Harry and Kaguya as characters (I think they were a pairing, but not sure).
