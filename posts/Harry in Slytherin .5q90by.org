Plz help me I am new to hpfanfiction doesn't know much.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/331576][Serpensortia]] - One of the BEST Slytherin Harry stories I've ever read, well fleshed out supporting cast and contains the same type of charm of the original books.

** linkffn(on the way to greatness by mira mirth) is probably the most recommended one out there. It's the quintessential Slytherin Harry story. Though updates are slowwwwww.

The linkffn(They Shook Hands : Year 1 (New Version) by dethryl) series is much recommended but I personally view it as a not as good version of OTWTG. In my opinion there isn't any conflict where there should be, especially between Draco (and his father) and Harry.

I looooooooove linkffn(magical relations) which has a Slytherin Harry and the characters are all awesome. It solves the problem I listed above about a lack of conflict and has a nice sort of realism with the characters.

Seconding the Serpensortia series! I really came to care about the secondary characters, who were very well written. Bummer that it's "completed" after third year, but you do get resolution.

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*

  After swearing I was done tinkering with the first entry in the series, the Muse struck me. Essentially the same story, but with a more solid introduction to the new characters. Names changed to protect the innocent. Less canon text. More Snape!

  A retelling of the original series, but this time, our hero wears green and silver, not red and gold.

** linkffn(9474009) has Harry going back in time to 4th year and gets resorted to Slytherin. He is fairly dark grey but doesn't kill people for no reason. There's a lot of Hermione/Nevill/Weasley bashing in there too.

Also this link has all the threads that mention Slytherin in them. Some won't be about Harry being sorted there but that should be the majority of them.

  After decades of an empty life and wars that claimed all he ever held dear, the greatest dark lord in living memory and his most loyal servant are finally ready to challenge fate and once again bring down their vengeance upon their enemies. AU, extended universe, Time-Travel, bashing and HAPHNE.
