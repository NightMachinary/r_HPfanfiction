**** Hm, I think Alfred is a bit old for a younger sibling of Harry's. I've double checked on using ONS data and Alfred drops in popularity from 11th in 1904, to 28th in the 1944. Then it doesn't appear at all in the top 100 for the rest of the centuary.

Pheobe is absolutely the sort of name that strikes me as being the right sort of age, probably because a relative was called it in the mid 90s (65th in 1996), but didn't really take off until post-2000 and particularly post-2010.

I find it all fascinating.

****** I really like the name Andrew which turns out to be popular around the right time, but I can't see Lily and James going for it. I'm not a huge fan of Chris, but it feels like it could fit.

I think I would probably go for Adam or Luke - Luke has that sort of 'could have been Lucas, but we shortened it - like Harry'.

For girls, I agree - Poppy I think goes nicely because it's a flower name and it also has that sort of 'brightness after war related loses' feel. Also, it's just a nice name. If Lily wanted to buck the trend, I think I'd choose Lucy.

Sadie is probably a bit American for me - but Eloise is a lovely name. (The 1994 lists reads like my class register, tbh.) Nothing wrong with Flora, except that it reminds me of spreadables. Ruined, lol.

I agree about Sadie being too American, how about Emily/Emilia/Emma? Or maybe Audrey? An alternative to Flora could be Fiona. Maggie, Maisie, Josie (Josephine). Lucy is a nice name, but here's the thing with me: I cannot tolerate two family members who have names that have matching first letters, it makes me twitch for some reason, which is why Jason is also off-putting.

Aha, you should hear what I've called my dog. You'd hate it.

My MIL named all her children with all the same first and ending letter. Then, all their childhood nicknames also had a different but the same as each other end letter. I cannot even. The new round of nicknames is barely any better! I cannot even. My wife (who has the name initial as me) wanted to carry on if we had a girl, but we've put off children for now - hence the dog.

So, I agree but Lucy is alright for me because the end sound is different. Actually. No. The more I sound it out, the closer they seem.

Josie struggles from the name problem as Sadie, I think. Maggie I think is also too old. All the other names are great.

Emma is not a personal favourite of mine, but I don't think my favourites and Lily and James' would overlap. Unless, I suppose they don't actually favour shorter names and just chose a more modern version of Henry.

Yes, I think Jason a viable contender except for James. Only reason I didn't put it down is a particular Jason from childhood.

Yikes, that lacks individuality and us extremely tacky. It's like naming your children, Olivia, Oliver, Olive, Olivier and Olivine.

When I suggested Josie and Maggie I was thinking along the lines of Little Women (Jo and Meg). So...Elizabeth nickname Beth actually seems a strong guarantee. Amelia nn Amy Potter.

Yeah, Lily and James seem to have that old fashioned, traditional style. As Petunia says, Harry is a nasty, common name if you ask her. Think along these lines, whatever Petunia wouldn't use, Lily and James would. Lily was actually not that popular a name in 1960, it didn't even reach the top 1000, although I don't know about variants of it. James has always been popular.

**** On my head I always pictured just one sibling. Lily would want Harry to have company, but she comes from a family of two, and even having one sibling was hard enough for her. I see no indications of she pursuing a particularly large family.

James is an only child, but he recognizes the value in relationships. Though I don't think he would like his family to be a closely held group. I see him more of the idea of having 2 kids, but very close to other kids their age... like hypothetical Sirius kids. Probably James would have pushed for a Harry-Neville friendship early on.

******* Yes, that's quite true. I always imagine 3-4 years between the two children in any case. I suppose them still being quite close in age, while still not being 'immediately into fidelius' age gap.

I think that after a few years under protection and being safe, it would have seemed more normal. So while they might have initially been really careful, they're not so much any more particularly as parents often feel broody once their older child isn't such a baby.

In my mind, I'm quite torn about Harry's conception. I think in canon it was suggested that people were setting up families quickly because of the war? I can understand marriage - James wants Lily to have his money and they're active members of a counter-terrorist group. But the baby?

On the other hand, I think that once people have had their first, they like to stick to their ideal age gaps as much as biology allows. Plus, the war was going on for most/all of the 1070s, so to an extent it could have seemed like life too them.

Maybe it could be traditions upholder by each family, as in, Arthur Weasley is the seventh child and he then goes to have seven children while Malfoys didn't have more than a single child for a set number of generations.

**** Maybe he has three brothers, the first Lily decides the name and goes with Tom since it's a pretty normal name. Then James gets to choose, and while trying to get a normal muggle name he ends up finding the seemingly perfect one on a DC comic, so perfect in fact that he just rushes up to register it without talking with anyone else, therefore the baby ends up named Riddle Potter. Then when the last is born Lily is still mad that James named one of their children Riddle and James is still mad that Lily won't admit that he is much better than her at this naming business, the result is that they can't agree with a name before the birth and then end up agreeing that each of their best friends get to choose a name and they will take a pice of each to combine in the name of the last child. Snape chooses Tricavolos, Sirius chooses Marcus, a coin toss later to decide the order and they take the newly named Marvolo Potter home.

And thus Harry becomes the Elder brother of Tom, Marvolo and Riddle. Dumbledore is slightly disturbed and Voldemort oddly touched.

**** There was an interesting post once about how while child Petunia may have called Lily a freak....Lily siding with Snape, the kid who nearly killed Petunia and who openly disdained her very existence was truly shitty (the flashback scene in DH where he goes "but she's a mug---"). Petunia was a little brat at that point, but she didn't seem to treat Lily as subhuman at that point when Snape clearly thought of Petunia as subhuman. Not to mention taking said kid who nearly killed her sister into her sister's bedroom and violating her privacy by reading Petunia's shit.

Basically..."siblings often talk shit to one another, it's not a shock that someone would react badly to first hearing about magic...especially when their first experience outside of their family is nearly being killed by it..." And instead of trying to help her, she goes "you're just a jealous loser" and keeps hanging out with the kid who thinks Petunia is dog shit.

Also, I have a sister, and we may talk shit about one another but god forbid I catch someone shit talking her...kind of like "hey, only I can call her a bitch." I'm pretty sure that's a common dynamic among siblings, and it doesn't seem to have carried over to Lily and Petunia.

******* This isn't really analagous to having a parent who is a different ethnicity though.

With different ethnicities, the kids are part that ethnicity. Like a Filipino parent would have Filipino or biracial kids. With wizard/muggle genetics, there's no such thing as being "part wizard" or "part muggle". Muggleborn wizards are still fully wizards, just born from muggles. And they're still considered more than a muggle or even a squib born of wizarding parents. It's an all or nothing inheritance. Like people who are born male and identify as male don't go around saying they're half-woman just because their mom is a female.

In Snape's case, his father abused him horribly because he was born a wizard instead of a muggle/squib. He was a little kid. Petunia and Lily were also kids, though Petunia was older. Snape experienced Petunia throwing abusive language at him and Lily (like his father), so how was he supposed to think differently about her or other muggles at that point? Sure Lily should have probably sided with her sister, but you can't hold children to adult standards of behavior.

I'm more miffed with Petunia for the decade of horrific abuse she put Harry through as a grown woman, simply because he was born a wizard and had the misfortune of being orphaned. A lot of that she would have been straight up jailed for if the authorities found out.

As to why Eileen didn't leave, domestic violence is pretty complex and there are lots of women who don't leave even though it looks like it should be easy to people from the outside looking in. Her and her son's lives would have been a lot better if she had, but you could ask the same thing about why Meriope Gaunt took so long to leave the Gaunt household where she was abused so badly by her dad and brother.

It's worth noting that abusers rarely start out beating on their significant others. It tends to build up gradually to that with a grooming process that involves isolating them and tearing down their self worth so they feel responsible for the change in the abuser's behavior toward them, and that they deserve it.

I'll say this though, as someone extremely close to somebody who went through domestic violence, I can understand why she didn't leave for around two decades until now, but Eileen had magic, which not a single person here can claim to have. In the case of my friend, I think magic would've sold 90% of her problems. Also, the difference between Merope and Eileen is the former was born into an abusive environment, and the latter actually chose to marry him and even stay. The first signs and she can very well have used her wand to make her muggle husband cower. I'm not blaming Eileen, I guess like McGonagall's mother, she had hope, didn't she?

She wasn't a bully, but could defenitely be shallow, overbearing and bratty sometimes. And the people she loved could do no wrong : aka how she turned a blind eye to Snape, Petunia and later James flaws. The same would be for Harry.

I think Harry would be a nicer version of Dude, regarding personality. Or a slightly nicer version of his father, as you said. I imagine Harry having another sibling exactly because they were young when Harry was born. A way more young sibling though, 6-10 years of difference.

I like to think that Harry would eventually became close to Hermione and Rony and would still marry Ginny, but in different circumstances and a way rockier start. Hermione and Rony would defenitly dislike Harry, and they would became friends in the later years after a lot of time sharing the same classes. Ginny relationship would be the basically same but with a "random girl in love with popular girl that don't know she exists" cliche undertone.

** I think he would have maintained his sense of adventure, but not tried to solve things on his own so much (or at least not until his later teens, perhaps upon feeling left out from the order). We're told James matured in his later years at Hogwarts. While Sirius may have encouraged some mischievous ways I think both Lily and James would have kerb pranks of the likes pulled by the marauders. Canon Harry was funny, so I imagine that this one might have enjoyed being funny.

Whether or not Harry was better socialised and trusting would probably have a lot to do with when the war ended. When Voldemort attacked the Potters, nobody knew who to trust. So, he may simply have trusted people he already knew rather than people he met.

I like to think it finished early enough for him to make friends with Ron, Neville and the children of other order members. This would make him more friendly and knowledgeable about who was around him, though I think his close friends would likely have still been small in number.

That said, I imagine that it would take Sirus (who needs to mature) and Remus (who feels unworthy) a few more years to find someone, perhaps having a few relationships lasting a couple of years or so before finding The One. Then, enough time to want to have a baby.

I think that his kinder traits would have stayed with him, encouraged by Lily and that his temper would have been more even due to indirectly learning positive coping skills.

Nevertheless, I think he would still struggle and felt weighed down by the prophecy and potentially having lost people he knew during the war, depending on how late/if it paused. So, more rounded but not a wholly different person.

I like to think he would have relied on his family more, but potentially could still have felt somewhat guilted into Albus' spiel about being the only person to solve it ('he won't stop hunting you down'). Lily and James would put up more of a fight than the canon order did.

** Let's talk about MBTI... it has its flaws but is what I have as of personality types.

So Lily is a ESFJ... and James is probably a ENTJ... canon Harry is a ISFP

Here is when we have a big chat about what traits are learned and which ones are inherent to one's self. That could go almost anywhere... however, having Lily for a mother I would imagine that Harry would still keep his F... don't see James turning that one. And S is probably there, as that could be a bit less about environment and a bit more about who Harry is as a person (he would still be good at Quidditch I suppose, and process his world similarly...)

​

So xSFx

​

The thing is that, as must of the fandom thinks, I agree that the I is the more likely to switch to E. With the confidence of a family and having Lily, James and (maybe) Sirius around would mean there is a big chance this Harry is an extrovert.

ESFx

Now both of his parents are J, but Sirius would be P and big influence. Besides, maybe Harry does has some tendency to P by himself.... IMO it could be either one of those...

​

Now MBTI has problems, but helps as a sort of a guide, after all 2 characters with the same type can be very differently. ESFJ, would mean that Harry is more similar to Percy Jackson than Lavender Brown (Both ESFJs)... Now Ron is an ESFP, but I don't think ESFP harry would be as funny or careless with words as Ron... I imagine Harry as more of a Disney-Hercules ESFP than a Ron ESFP.

But hey those are just some patterns, people can be very different, even within a MBTI type.

*** I like this train of thought, and it doesn't lump Harry into an ESFP stereotype. Although I'm curious how you judged Lily as ESFJ and James ENTJ without much personality to go on about? I personally don't have a headcanon for either but James struck me always as ESXP, and Lily is out in the open.

**** Okay so James... That guy is as N as the Weasley twins. His prankster mind keeps him thinking on new ways to improve what he has already done before. Not looking at the current thrills but already a step ahead, "how can I make this more epic?" "Evans is rejecting me now, yes, but she'll come around." James is all about the future.

New the J... compare to Sirius who is ENTP, as the twins... James is the leader.... he is the one with the plan. He is the "Lets all turn into animagus and help moony".

Going deeper about functions lets compare James to HBP Ginny (a real ESTP)

ENTJS main function is ET (voicing his thoughts and plans of epic pranks out loud, voicing how cool he is, always letting the people know).... ESTP is ES (which leads to the athletic type inherent to Ginny's personality)

Second function would be IN for James, which again planning for pranks. ESTP's is IT, so that's where Ginny's toughness and direct manners come.

Third is ES for ENTJs which is the physical Quidditch part of James. EF for ESTPS (RRemember Ginny voicing her feelings out loud, especially to Ron? James is open with his thought but Ginny is open with her feelings)

fourth is IF for ENTJs, IN for ESTPs... less developed functions.

** One alternate Harry raised by James and Lily that I really like is the one from Imprisoned Realm linkffn(2705927).

He's...complicated, due to the environment he grows up in - he has a more loving home, true, but he also grows up in the midst of a worsening war due to the fact that Voldemort never left. He doesn't escape the ramifications of the prophecy, which has some serious consequences for his personal development and the turns the story takes.

I won't go into more spoiler-y details, but I really like how the author handled his characterization and the effects that a changed upbringing had on him. He retains almost all of canon!Harry's good qualities: very loving and protective of his family and friends, kind, smart, athletic, a natural leader, with a particular knack for improvisation and on-the-spot solutions. There's also some noticeable differences, however. Without the Dursleys holding him back, and with the awareness that he's essentially the Chosen One and the immense pressure that brings with, he's more academically brilliant than canon!Harry, but also develops something of a subtle mean streak (that due to spoilery reasons gets worse later). He has a slight ego and tends to overestimate himself, but not to the extent that it would make him a jerk like a teenaged James or Malfoy. Both James and Lily would've been watching out for that, and also he has more serious problems occupying his attention, namely the war. Instead, his precociousness and tendency to keep things to himself (a trait that canon!Harry also exhibits) lands him in some truly awful situations that only he can get himself out of, with considerable cost. Overall, he's a fascinating character study that's still recognizably Harry, but with a few significant differences that drives the plot of the tale.

Another alternate Harry that I really like is the one in Brightest Witch of Her Age linkao3(9344273). It's a story centered on a GWL!Hermione, but it puts a fair bit of focus on a different Potter family too.

In it, Lily dies, and Harry is raised by James and Remus. The author is brilliant in that she's managed to portray a different Harry, as a side character, within the limited space of the story, astoundingly successfully. It's in that sweet spot of "this is still recognizably Harry, with the same fundamental personality, but also has enough differences that can be tracked to the environment he grows up in" that I really love. It's a very unique characterization that you'll have to read to understand the charm of: he's easy-going, insanely funny, humble, loyal, and perceptive (which canon!Harry actually is, when he's not stressed out of his mind). He doesn't always need to be the center of attention (like old James), but he's always watching out for the people around him and ready to take things over if need be. You can just /feel/ that he's covering a lot of things with his easy-going facade and sense of humour. When you read to the end you realize that everything about him has to do with the fact that he grew up with two war-weary, grieving adults, and he ends up taking on part of their emotional burden and other, smaller burdens early on, in as unobtrusive a way as possible so as to give them space, and that's why he's the way he is: watchful, compassionate, always dependable at moments of crisis.

One memorable quote (of which this fic has many): /"His father taught him how to fly, and he tried to learn how to smile--wide, wild--from how his mother did in photographs. "/

Essentially, I think there are some things about Harry that won't change no matter how he grows up: he is a naturally compassionate person, which leads him to develop a moral compass that's sensitive to the injustices of the world, as well as making him perceptive when it comes to other people. He's intuitive, smart, and naturally charismatic. He deals well with crisis situations. It's also important, I think, to take into account other factors: if James and Lily survive, does it mean the war is still not over? In which case, with two parents who are active combatants, he would grow up quite different from a Harry who grows up in peaceful times. I think it's almost a given that a Harry raised by J&L&godfathers would be more sociable than canon Harry, likely more academically brilliant too. The hero-complex is less certain: if the prophecy is still in effect, the hero-complex would only get worse, not better, given that even if he doesn't grow up consciously knowing about it, he would almost certainly subconsciously react to the unspoken expectations of the adults around him, and try to take on more than he can deal with, alone.

  When Hermione Jean Granger was one year old her parents died in a car crash.

Where do songs come from? Why did Jenny Hopkins call me a--?Her father had accelerated into a green light, like you were supposed to. (By the time she was eight, Hermione had the driver's rulebook memorized). A truck driver, going the opposite way, hadn't stopped at a red.Hermione had been strapped in a car seat in the back, her aunt and uncle told her. She hadn't been hurt at all except for the scar that stood out, jagged, on her forehead.As Hermione grew up into a gangly, bushy-haired, buck-toothed wonder, she thought she could remember it-- a glaring green light, a rush of cold air.

**** Yeah, the author has some great AU takes done in a similar style that you can check out, but personally this one is my favorite, mainly due to Harry's characterization which is really one of a kind. Done with such limited space, too, and it makes so much /sense/.

Definitely check out Imprisoned Realm, too. A fairly big chunk of the dramatic question there is pretty squarely centered on "what sort of person is alternate Harry, really", and the question of how he got there. It's a truly fascinating piece of character study, done with a fantastically original plot.

** I read a story a while back (can't remember the title, sorry) with James and Lily living, so Harry grew up almost entirely in the magical world. His only knowledge of muggles came from duty visits to the Dursleys, who were as nasty as in canon, so Harry developed a dislike of muggles which he hid from most people but couldn't shake off. I think that could have happened to him. He'd also be generally happier and more self-confident, picking up a lot more of James's character traits.

** I think he would be mostly the same, though definitely more confident and sociable. I think he would also put more effort at school because he would have someone to make proud of him. In canon, it was even mentioned how Petunia got angry with him whenever he did better at school than Dudley, but if he was raised by Lily and James, it wouldn't have happened.\\
I think he would have more friends, but also different friends - Neville comes to mind since Alice and Frank were in the Order.\\
He would definitely be more aware of what is happening in the magical world (obviously!), but at the same time, he would be pretty clueless when it comes to muggles.\\
I see him mostly as someone who is smart and cheeky and brave; someone who would be very protective of his family and friends - taking example from James. I think he would have siblings, probably close in age. It's my headcanon that James, although adored by his parents, was a little lonely as the only child, so he would probably want to have at least two children, and close in age.\\
But I don't think James and Lily would allow him to grow evil, arrogant, mean or anything like that.

** I think Harry would be pampered and quite rich. He would be a bit spoiled but good hearted. Like a nicer version of Dude or Draco. I say that because Lily is someone who tends to close her eyes to the flaws of the people she loves and I she is basically as a nicer and prettier version of Petunia. She would be quite permissive to her children and they can do "no wrong". She would also be overprotective towards strangers, and a bit of an overbearing mother in law.

I also imagine Harry would at least have one more sibling. Harry would be the cool overprotective older brother. And for that to happen Harry would grow up in the middle of the war, or Voldemort would be defeated in the day he invaded their home.

Harry and Dude would still hate each other in family gatherings "ugh that annoying cousin" and I'm not sure if they would ever make amends or get close because Dude wouldn't be raised with Harry and probably wouldn't question their different treatments. Even if Dude gets better he probably wouldn't reach Harry. Petunia would ressent that Lily got more than one children.

Harry would also be close to Sirius since childhood. James would be proud that Harry got into sports and he and Sirius would stirr Harry's mischievous side. This would cause some bickering with Lily that wants a well behaved, composed child. Harry and James would agree with her, but would keep with their mischievous stuff behind her back, until she discovers it again and the same thing repeats.

**** There's a big gap between JKR's rhetoric and what she actually writes, when it comes to moral characterisation.

JKR's rhetoric is all about free will and choice. See, for example, Dumbledore in CoS where he says it's choice which matters. Or indeed that quote where she says that if Merope had chosen to love Tom, he would have turned out better.

What she actually writes, however, is completely different. Harry is just a fundamentally good person in a way that is divorced from his upbringing (Dursley environment would be extremely unlikely to give rise to a person of Harry's character) and his own actions (he tortures people but is still considered good). Tom, on the other hand, is depicted as essentially born evil and irredeemable. The characters' capacity to choose is an illusion, because the choices they make will always reflect their fundamental, pre-determined natures.

There's an old article, only accessible via the WayBack Machine, which explains this better than I can:
