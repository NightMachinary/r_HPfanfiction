No Nice Goblins, never understood this trope. They can help, but not be nice. It can be something else that destroys the Horcrux inside as well.

Anyone can be the MC/Any site/Any length/old or new

Would rather ii be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine

Would rather NOT have Weasley Bashing. No Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune, no Ginny giving Harry a love potion, etc.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes etc. (Doesn't have to focus on pairings)


** There was this fic, i dont remember the name. Harry made contact with his horcrux before going to Hogwarts, he was sorted into Slytherin and the horcrux would give him terrible headaches when he didnt do what voldemort wanted. And then Harry was forced to try to take the Philosopher stone. He absorbed the horcrux in QuirrelI and then I think Dumbledore recognized Harry was a horcrux, killed and buried him in the Forbidden forest. But Harry didnt die. He woke up and was planning on leaving Hogwarts.

** Linkao3(13893606) is great, and the sequel is being continued by the author's new account Linkao3(24096307) . It features grey/dark Harry though, if you don't like that then it might not be for you

  Albus Dumbledore watched two visionaries start as driven, powerful, brilliant young men, and become monsters. He has no heir, no protege of equal power to step in should another one rise, and he is old. So when he hears of a Chosen One with power the Dark Lord knows not, he thinks maybe he doesn't want this boy prophesied to defeat Lord Voldemort to grow up in the Wizarding world. He thinks of the bonds of family, and the opportunity he has to shape his world's politics, and of a corrupt magical elite who've signed on with two Dark Lords over hatred of Muggles. He thinks Harry Potter should grow up loved by his family, and Voldemort be destroyed so there is no need for Harry to ever realize his power, and he acts to make both of those things happen. Because he's Dumbledore and what he wants, he gets. Usually. When you dabble with improvised ritual magic, you should be aware there might be unforeseen consequences. For example: souls touch.

  Sequel to Souls Touch, and the Future Changes, authored by now-deleted account sunmoonandstars, which used to be me. Harry continues to struggle with adapting to and understanding the wizarding world, which increasingly seems to have backed itself into a corner by allowing rampant anti-Muggle belief to coexist with rampant ignorance of the Muggle world. Of course, there is also the problem of being a "Light" icon in Slytherin, not to mention the fact that someone seems determined to hamstring Harry's independence.
