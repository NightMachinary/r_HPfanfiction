You know the movie about the emotions running around in someones head?

Well it gave me this idea about a huge control center that controls all magic and wizards and witches have access to pull magic from there.

The prompt could be of the people inside running around like ”Oh sh*t Dumbledore's using wandless again” ”Oh how'd Voldy get so much of it on that pull??!?”

You can change the prompt idea a bit too! Get some improvements in this thing

Have fun writing this prompt!

Sincerely

Someone who can't write, The keeper of the books and fics
