Be it because of betrayal from the Light, those evil, nasty muggles or just a midlife crisis making him want to try his hand at being evil, Harry decides he regrets killing Voldemort and goes back to change that. Preferably without plot-regurgitation but I'll take what I can get.

Slash, dark!other characters, crossovers and bashing are fine. Please no pottercest, harems, genderbending, romance/smut-driven plot or mpreg. Thank you!


** linkao3(Again and Again)

Harry keeps getting thrown back in time every time his life ends and is trying to find a way to get it to stop. This time he decides to not kill Voldemort and team up with him instead.

The summary is not very accurate. Harry isn't really evil/dark and his power and experience is well portrayed. Dumbledore bashing is not really bashing most of the time since his behavior is somewhat understandable since Harry is ignoring him and prophecy. The slash between Tom and Harry is not too bad since it's skippable and Harry ends up making him mostly sane and look more like Tom Riddle rather than Voldemort. His goal is trying to change the Wizarding world for the better via politics rather than via killing and fear. Interesting premise and storyline even if it does include a few cliches.

******** I suppose I should clear things up.

I had a bad day today, but that doesn't justify me acting like an asshole simply because we have different opinions. My point is that Again and Again(and the rest of Athey's Harry/Voldemort stories) is a great story, whether you factor the slash or not. The writing is excellent and the plot unique, two things that Harry/Voldemort slash usually doesn't have together.

I will ignore a lot of things(ex - slash, pure evil, stupid characters) if those two factors are in play.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. Story is high on Political intrigue. Dumbledore!bashing slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

** Ive always wondered if there were more fics sorta in this same vein... where Harry goes back in time to team up with Tom (starting school at the same time as him).

However unlike your post, I was mainly curious about ones that were less "dark", and more.. change the world. So instead of being dark... rather, he works with Tom to curb who he is, and they both look to make waves in the wizarding world via power and politics but avoiding the really dark side of things (Horcruxes, indiscriminate murder, muggleborn discrimination, muggle killing, and the like).

I also am not a big fan of slash and always thought it would be fun if Harry was paired with Bellatrix or Narcissa, and Tom with the other of them.

*** I feel like there's a lot of that but i honestly cannot think of one other than Altered Destinies.

I'd be more interested in a fic where Harry goes back with the intention of turning Tom but gets turned /by/ Tom instead.

By all accounts the boy was extremely charming and there /must/ be reasons other than small-minded bigotry and simple power lust that so many people joined him.

There's quite a few dark!Harry's that kind of explore these other reasons but they are still so ridiculously black and white in their approach, where the Light side is secretly evil and Harry is just doing what he must etc. (or it's just a psycho power wank).

I'd like a fic that shows an /actual/ grey Harry (for lack of a better term), and doesn't just call him grey when he's really just the only reasonable person and everyone else is a moron.

**** I am a big fan of grey harry. And just to clarify, I'm not saying Harry doesn't stray more grey, or even borderline dark in such a fic, just not nearly as dark as Tom as gone. There is becoming powerful and learning dark arts, and using power and whatnot, and then there is Horcruxes, rape, and murdering villages of muggles. I too have seen quite a few dark!harry / voldemort stories, although fewer where hes gone back in time, but rarely have I seen some sort of middle ground fic between the two where Harry gets darker and Volemort gets lighter and they strike some sort of balance.

  You always get the stories where Harry goes back into Tom Riddle's time, then either stays or gets sent back. End of, unless he tries to make Voldemort good. But what if things went differently? What if, just once, someone followed a time traveller back?
