Hello,

I'm looking for a story - Harry Potter/Lord Voldemort. (I'm not sure if it's Voldemort or Tom..)

Voldemort won the first war, and muggle-borns are separated from purebloods and attending a different school. Lily and James Potter are alive and living with Harry's twin brother in exile - James tricked Lily into abandoning Harry and as such Harry attended the different school under the name Evans.

Harry works as a guard. Catches Voldemort's eye by being brilliant and becomes his lover. Together they fight the exiled remains of resistance and Dumbledore in politics. They travel around the world and in Mexico meet a powerful wizard who takes Harry under his wing. Then sends Dumbledore where the sun doesn't shine at some political ball everybody, and their grandma is attending (yes, Neville's grandma is there, too). Dumbledore sends some guys (James between them I think) after them - they die as a sacrifice to the gods by the all-powerful wizard.

It ends up with Harry and Voldemort leaving for the mystical Shangri-La.

I'm sorry for that word vomit - I can't write a summary for the death of me.

Halp. Somebody?...

All halp appreciated.
