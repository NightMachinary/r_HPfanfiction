/(Reposting this because the last thread a month ago had exactly zero answer, so I mus've come at a bad time or something.)/

Are there any good stories (fanfics or otherwise) focusing on Boggarts? Not as a way to showcase characters' fears, but on boggarts as creatures in and on themselves. There are two specific things I'd like to see in particular, though any other recommendations are fine too:

- A story showing (or discussing) what would happen if someone's worst fear was "a boggart". I think that one's on par with the Pinocchio paradox to be honest. If you have any non-fic ideas for how to answer this question, be sure to post them too!

- Someone in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4zepjr/request_boggart_turns_into_something_and_stays/][this old Boggart-related thread]] mentioned "a story where Neville befriends a Boggart". That sounds fascinating. Can anyone track this down?


** Right so for furture reference, it seems the "Neville's pet Boggart" story was linkffn(Harry Potter and the Garden of Intrigue).

  In which Harry understands Victorian flower language at age 11. Events grow gradually further and further from the original. Features CharacterDevelopment!Crabbe and Goyle, and many other not-quite-expected variations. This story has reached its conclusion; enjoy. Watch out for the April Fools' chapter.
