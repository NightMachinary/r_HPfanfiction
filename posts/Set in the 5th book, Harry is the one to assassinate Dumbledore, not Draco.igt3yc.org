Dumbledore watches from a far as Harry becomes more strange, more isolated...He observes as flashes of red flickers across his eyes before returning to its prominent green.


** Ooh I know a fic that does this!! It's a series called the Downward Spiral Saga and it is seriously fucked up, I love it!!

*** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Homecoming) is the first fic in the series. However, this fic is fucked up, like [[/u/magic-spaghetti][u/magic-spaghetti]] said. Maybe not as much as the other fics, but it's still fucked up. I vastly remember a scene involving Harry, Millicent (?) And a dead Hermione.
