It's all in the title, just imagine it!

Luna sitting on a thrown with the entire world bowing before her... it'd be amazing.


** Deciding that her happiness revolves around her friends' happiness, she does elaborate, expensive, at-wand-point weddings for Hermione and Ron, Harry and Ginny.

They're... not sure whether to be grateful or terrified.

*** Then she forces the Ministry to create a Snorkack Room in the DoM

**** Haha, I could see her sending out teams of Unspeakables to find the creatures she and her father believe in.

People are both too terrified to say no yet are happy they scored a free holiday, albeit in places like the Welsh wilderness/Scandinavia's fjords.

***** Or file false reports of Snorcack sightings in ideal vacation spots... "My Lady, I heard a rumor that the Snorcacks migrate to Fiji in January, I think I should go investigate. Also there's a German muggle tabloid that reported sightings of 'some sort of creature with a crumpled horn' near Munich in October, I think I need to check that too... just to be thorough."

For that matter... I imagine that if the highly reputable American publication "The Weekly World News" were brought to the Dark Lady Luna's attention, she would no doubt recognise it as the closest competition for The Quibbler. And I think the "Bat Boy" creature on the cover would surely interest her, and the article says it's a known associate of one "Elvis Presley", resident in some town called Las Vegas. Clearly the Dark Lady's servants would need to go to this Las Vegas to interrogate him to learn the creature's whereabouts. Should only take them a week or two.

****** "Oh yes," she said with a bemused smile. "I know that they're lying. However, it's easier to send them off on their little vacations than spending the time to clean the blood out of spell-resistant rugs."

At their looks, she shrugged. "I may be a Dark Lady, but I'm a lazy Dark Lady."
