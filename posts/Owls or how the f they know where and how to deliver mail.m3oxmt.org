Is it a natural ability? Are they trained? Is it an enchantment? Can any owl deliver mail? What is your head canon in regards to owls and their abilities?

I'm thinking of writing a story with magical creatures being an important part and I don't know how to approach owls


** I imagine, like a subset of humans and trees, there are also regular animals that are magical, too.

** They are magical owls and specifically trained, yes.

This answers your questions. If you do want to change anything from regular FF, keep in mind this:

#+begin_quote
  Trained owls are expensive, and it is quite usual for a wizarding family to share a single owl, or else only use Postal owls.
#+end_quote

Every Tom and Dick doesn't own an owl, put a price tag of ~1000 Galleons on one (the equivalent of a cheap, but new car), and otherwise, have average people visit the Owl Office for mail often.

** So I'm writing this Hedwig story and have thought about it for a while. Can't be trained to reach people that they trainer doesn't know where to find. It had to be magic. Though nothing like apparition, since it takes them quite time to deliver. Probably more related to magic to find the right person... I guess you can go either way in regular owl working or not... I would be more inclined to the delivery owls actually being bestowed with the magic to deliver letters.

** My idea is many creatures we muggles consider ordinary like owls actually are magical and have minor magical abilities. Wizards constantly obliviate people to hide their magical abilities and would hide them entirely if they can but fear people might notice something is off if an entire species so deeply ingrained in their culture disappears all of a sudden. Owls are capable of reading minds and can triangulate peoples locations using magic. much like how pigeons can use magnetic fields.

Or maybe some owls are magical much like how some humans are and these owls can use magic to locate people but cant do much more because they dont think like we do.

** I've always been of the mind that they were a mix of selective breeding with magical enhancing, natural insinct, and training. Kind of like how carrier pidgeons used to be used to send messages.

Mind you it's been a /very/ long time since I researched them, but it was a mix of training and natural instinct where they had set roosts to deliver to and from.

** I imagine it's kinda like magical owls started not being able to but as wizards started trying send mail with them they used a charm and the owl's magic being more geared towards survival kinda just adapted leading to owl's being able to find the adress on their own
