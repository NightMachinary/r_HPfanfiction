This is my personal opinion but I hate it when a main character in the original series is just killed off at random in AU fic.

Let me explain with 2 examples. In a fic I cannot recall, Harry for a certain reason, wasn't that close with Ron or Hermione, so in first year Halloween, he didn't care enough to realise Hermione was missing, thus, nobody came to save Hermione from the troll and she just dies in that moment of the story. We don't even get a POV of her dying. Harry just finds out the next day that Hermione dies.

In another fic, Harry didn't go to Hogwarts for his first, second and third year. Thus, nobody found the Chamber of Secrets and it was almost off-handedly mentioned that Ginny died then. In both stories, their deaths happened early on in the story and felt like a mere footnote.

I can't really explain well why I hate it when AU stories do that besides it just feeling like a waste of a character. I don't know if anyone can explain it better than I do but it's just how I feel. Anyways, what do you guys think?


** It's not ideal. However, I think I'd prefer a character being got rid of quickly than have to read 20 chapters of them being bashed.

** In my opinion doing something such as this and killing a main canon character is a lot better than creating inexplicable ways for that said character to be involved in the new AU. For example if Harry is in slytherin why would he even be involved in Hermione's situation? This is an AU and the main characters do not have to stay the same as in canon. It's fanfiction.

** I don't really feel like it's a problem to me. If a death makes sense, it's completely okay to me. In the case of Hermione, if the reasons for her going to cry in the bathroom are okay and no one comes to save her, I think she should die.

The problem comes from treating her as a main character. In canon she is one. In the fanfic, she isn't. Not every death is important, and they don't have to be.

Accidental magic is a thing though. Neville got yeeted out of a window by his uncle and he just bounced off the ground, so there is a good case for accidental magic protecting you from blunt force trauma.

** Your first fic is linkffn(They Shook Hands), I think. It seemed unnecessary to me because Hermione was not a major part of the story, seemed the author was just doing it to make a point.

I'm fine with a character being killed off if that space /isn't occupied/ by another character, but serves as a meaningful catalyst for a story divergence. Probably the best example is linkffn(Forging the Sword), where Ginny's death in the chamber sparks commitment in Harry, Ron, and Hermione's characters, while they still stay in character. The fic is effective because the importance of Ginny and her loss is always imminent, and there's no replacement for her.

  After swearing I was done tinkering with the first entry in the series, the Muse struck me. Essentially the same story, but with a more solid introduction to the new characters. Names changed to protect the innocent. Less canon text. More Snape!

Book1 has the perfect out: the train ride. Harry grew up being treated like crap and having to hide his "ugly" scar. Then he went to Diagon where EVERYONE had to look at it and it clearly made him uncomfortable. Him distancing himself from Ron isn't that much of a stretch. Have him eventually join up with Dean and Seamus.

** It's a way the writer has of writing them off, or even representing realistic consequences to whatever changes happened.

It's also contraposition to Slytherin!Harry befriending Hermione in one hell of a coincidence, or a calculative, studious Harry befriending Ron.

On the other side, one could say that without Harry, Hermione wouldn't have heard Ron talking about her, and so wouldn't be in the bathroom.

The Diary is harder, because Lucius wanted to get revenge on Arthur, so maybe Harry not being there would just make Lucius give it to Ginny at another time.

Without Harry in the school or Ginny talking about him to Tom, who knows what the diary would have done. I understand the whole message on the wall(the last one) was to bait Harry into going there(since only he could open the entrance) otherwise Tom could have said nothing and restored himself in peace.
