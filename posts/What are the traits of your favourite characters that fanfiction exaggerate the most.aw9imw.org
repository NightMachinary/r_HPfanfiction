** - Voldemort - he's made awkward and creepy in fanfic, instead of scary and menacing like in canon. His baldness, noselessness, and his lack of shoes, and his other weird characteristics are pointed out, often by Harry, in order to mock him to his face with a nickname like "Voldy-bore" or "Moldywhore". Voldemort being barefoot is from the movies.

- Tom Riddle - in darkfics where we're supposed to sympathize with him (and where Manipulative!Dumbledore is the evil one) his orphan backstory is played up, with his meals of thin gruel taken away by the matron to teach him discipline, regular beatings by the other orphans, and exorcisms every Sunday by the local priest.

  - In shipfics where we're supposed to see him as a viable love interest, his canonical appealing traits are turned up to eleven. This guy has the perfect chiseled jaw, the waviest, sleekest hair, the chocolatiest, most seductive voice, the bod of a +Greek God+ Zyzz Brah. And for some reason, in this genre of fanfic, his "villainy" and "darkness" translates to him being a brooding young man who turned to BDSM because he couldn't know love.

**** People pairing Tom Riddle (usually Tom instead of Voldemort, because Tom looks like an actual human being) comes from a JKR comment in an interview, where she said that if Merope had lived to raise Tom, and Tom had known love, he would be a completely different person.

That's taken by fanfic authors to mean that he can be "cured" by lovin', and if he falls in love with the right person, it will turn him from a genocidal proto-serial killer into a nice and law-abiding wizard.

****** Tom being born from rape doesn't make him a bad person. It wasn't like he could have done anything about. It was his childhood environment that helped make him what he was, and that depends on Merope.

--------------

- If Merope had kept drugging Tom Snr, Tom Jnr would grow up without respecting muggles, as from his experience, he'd only see muggles as weak, inferior tools to be used. Tom would become resentful of Merope's attachment to Tom Snr, as anytime she tries to lower Snr's dosage, he starts screaming about witches and tries to run away, until Merope stuns him and brings him back to the house. I can't see Tom being able to form functional, meaningful relationships with other people, after being set no examples in his own home.

- If Merope had the baby and lived, then went back to the Gaunt shack, Tom would be abused from childhood by his uncle, who mocks him for his muggle face and dirty blood. Tom would grow up without respecting muggles, hate his family, and open the CoS in first year, if he went to Hogwarts instead of being "homeschooled" by Morfin. But hey, in this reality, Dumbledore wouldn't deliver the letter and set his wardrobe on fire.

- If Merope womanned up, became a single mother with a job, and raised Tom on her own, Tom would grow up resentful of her for being so poor, untalented, and uneducated that she could only get minimum wage work and force him to live in a tiny flat and wear second-hand robes. He would go into Slytherin, proud of his Gaunt name, and blame his father for disgracing his mother, and turn into a major jerk as usual. But even if he resents Merope, he'd still love her in a weird narcissistic way for giving him his heritage, and would show off in front of his mates at Platform 9 3/4 by speaking to Merope in Parseltongue. This is the better ending, since his mother gives him some connection to wizarding society, making it harder for him to change names and disappear like the original Tom Riddle did.

In every universe, Tom is still a big dickhead, whether or not he becomes a Dark Lord.

******** I don't think that Tom would care that much that he was born from rape, tbh.

Voldemort has no moral boundaries, so he wouldn't see rape as morally wrong, just like he wouldn't consider plagiarism, shoplifting, manipulation, and murder as "wrong". But he would consider people who resort to rape (or who lust over other people) as weak and foolish, or sad and desperate, and would consider himself above wasting his valuable time and magic on such trifles.

The biggest reaction from him would be seeing it as a reflection on Merope's character, and after that he'd never respect Merope, if he had any respect for her at all. That doesn't mean he can't grow up, become Minister, buy a house with a garden for Merope, and generally treat her like a pet to be trotted out for the photo-ops.

Combined with his intelligence and ambition, which is going to be pretty strong in any universe where he is raised from childhood knowing that Slytherin is his great-grandfather, he was never going to be a soft and cuddly guy.

But, hey, a Minister Riddle-Gaunt would actually be effective in making changes to the wizarding world, compared to the useless pandering done by the alternative, Minister Fudge.

*********** I categorically reject the idea that he couldn't have been a kind, loving person if he'd had a healthy childhood, but nor do I believe that Merope could have ever provided one. This is the woman who was abused by her father and brother, whom Harry describes as the most "defeated-looking person" he's ever seen, who sincerely believed that drugging a hot dude whom she has a crush on because he's hot was a super romantic way to go about things (admittedly that last one is just Dumbledore's speculation, but, like, it's consistent with what we see of her). It's not even a matter of financial stability, although that's obviously an issue, too: she as a person was fundamentally unequipped for parenthood.

** Sirius.

His character is almost always trashed no matter what the author's intentions are. Rare are the fics that portray him as canon portrayed him - a grim, haunted man with so many demons whose only priority is Harry's safety and well-being.

Instead, we have him being a fun-loving, comedic womaniser in 99% of fics.

James also gets this treatment although to a lesser extent - Lily is almost always written as the character with better traits than James, even though she's the one who's a poor judge of character.

Fanon-Hermione is something that I absolutely detest. She can literally do no wrong.
