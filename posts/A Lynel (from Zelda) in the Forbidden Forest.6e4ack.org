Okay, so, raise your hands (or other prehensile organs) if you've been playing Zelda: Breath of the Wild.

Okay, so, the strangest thought. Lynels in BotW are the toughest of tough. So what would happen if we transplanted one into another universe? Like, say, Harry Potter?

Imagine, the centaurs fleeing the Forbidden Forest...make that, practically everything fleeing the Forbidden Forest, because of the appearance of a large and angry, fire-breathing, magic arrow shooting, /not-centaur/ that seems to have more health than a Nundu.

How would everyone respond to it? Would Hogwarts be evacuated? Would a task force enter the Forest to try and take it down? Would Voldemort attempt to capture it to use against his enemies? Would the Killing Curse even work?


** There are giant, man-eating spiders in the forbidden forest and everyone is fine with those things.

I think you're drastically overestimating the actual effect this would have. For one thing, the centaurs know the Forbidden Forest. They've lived there for as long as anyone knows, so they have the home turf advantage. Lynels are fast, sure, but having cover alone makes them magnitudes less dangerous.

So, your final questions in order: No. There are man-eating spiders in the forbidden forest and no one gives a damn.

Maybe? But the centaurs could probably deal with it easily.

No. That's not his style. He only uses things he can control or negotiate with, like the Dementors and Giants and Werewolves, not wild beasts.

Possibly not, but there are a number of other methods that would work just fine. The Sword of Gryffindor definitely, an arrow dipped in basilisk venom, or possibly one of a number of poisons.

But really? A wizard could deal with it easily. Conjunctivitis curse, transfiguration, the blasting curse, Sectumsempra. McGonagall could animate the Hogwarts statues against it. So no. A lynel isn't a threat to Hogwarts.

*** The problem with saying 'it wouldn't work' is that it doesn't make a very long fic. Professor blows up the mysterious monster centaur with a blasting curse, the end.

Also, the man-eating spiders keep to themselves, magic resistance is a thing in the Harry Potter verse (see trolls, giants, and dragons), and hitting the lynel with an arrow/spell/sword would require not getting toasted by a fireball or magic arrow first, and getting it through the lynel's shield (assuming it has one) and their hide. Which in turn raises the question of 'in a crossover, should Zelda monsters be stronger than Harry Potter creatures/magic?'

Actually, now I wonder. Given that house-elves can pop around Hogwarts even without Apparation being possible there, could a Lynel use their teleportation around Hogwarts as well?

Also, question for you; would you prefer to talk about a story with X Harry Potter Character being in the Zelda: Breath of the Wild world?

**** 'and hitting the lynel with an arrow/spell/sword would require not getting toasted by a fireball or magic arrow first, and getting it through the lynel's shield (assuming it has one) and their hide.'

This is not a problem. One, trees for cover. Two, disillusionment charms are a thing. Plus, there are a myriad of protective spells that could probably handle arrows. A Lynel would just be another class XXXX or XXXXX magical beast.
