:END:
Okay, so there was this fanfic that I read about 8 or so years ago on Fanfiction.net and I'm wondering if anyone else remembers it. It is a bit of a weird story.

The story took place at Hogwarts after drugs and alcohol were introduced to the entire school. So everyone, the students and the staff, are all on drugs and just are messing around the whole time. No one ever goes to class and are just partying all the time. Like people are just hooking up in the hallways and no one cares.

The only two that are sober in the school are Hermione and Draco-- mostly because Draco's dad would be upset if he did drugs, if I remember correctly. So they start to form a bit of a friendship in this absolute mayhem of a school. One part I do really remember is that Hermione either tried drugs or got drunk and Draco was super upset about it.

Does anyone else remember this story? For some reason it just popped into my mind recently.
