** I really like Resonance, Revolution, and Resolution by GreenGecko! It follows the last year or two of Hogwarts and then Auror training, and though the first chapter or two I feel is a bit rocky, it hits its stride really quickly and become excellent, both in writing quality and story. Snape is also a main character, but since it is an AU fic, he is not terribly in character, but also not alarmingly out of character.
