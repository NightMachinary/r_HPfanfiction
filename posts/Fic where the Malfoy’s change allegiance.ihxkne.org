Are there any fics where the Malfoy's secretly change sides before or during the war? Not like completely doing a 180 and becoming super sweet or anything. But if it was a strategic move. Narcissa Malfoy always fascinated me. She was very sly and cunning -and I wonder what it would have been like if she actively helped the other side. Thanks for any recommendations!

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** In my story "The Dark Lord Never Died", Malfoy keeps going after Halloween 1981 and fakes the Dark Lord's survival to take over Britain - and promptly stabs Voldemort in the back and sets himself up as the ruler of the country. It leads to a three-way war between Voldemort, Malfoy and Dumbledore 20 years later.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** I remember a fic where Harry(I think) went to an alternate universe where Lucius was a spy against Voldemort. Can't recall the name though.

  Harry is summoned to an alternate universe still suffering under Voldemort less than an hour after his own defeat of the bastard. Worse, he's not the first Harry Potter they've called on this way. Worst yet (at the moment), there is no way back home. But give Harry time, and he's likely to find something that's even worse.
