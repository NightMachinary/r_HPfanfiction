The mages of the Roman Empire were smug in the perceived superiority of their magic over "barbarian practices", happily ignoring the non-magical contribution of the Legions in subjugating new provinces. They also despised any magic they couldn't use or control, and so did everything they could to stamp out other magical traditions everywhere the Empire went.

In Britain, as in much of Europe, they were phenomenally successful. The magical culture they seeded grew to utterly dominate British magic. Its hold only tightened with the founding of Hogwarts, which taught all young British witches and wizards in the Roman tradition. By the enactment of the Statute of Secrecy, Roman-style magic was so dominant that the nearly-forgotten native magics were blanketly forbidden as Dark.

Magic, however, is not so easily controlled by mortal whims. The Magic of Britain, guided by the Tuatha de Danann, soon responded to its lack of practitioners by reaching out to the minds of young magicals, whispering to them the secrets of the old ways. Very few could hear these whispers, deafened by their belief that magic as they knew it was all of magic, and even fewer would listen.

If those born of wizards couldn't hear or wouldn't listen, then more open minds would need to be found; magic was increasingly gifted to children of ordinary folk. Some of these "Muggle-borns" began to touch the magics of the Isles, but when this was discovered by those of long magical lineage they were condemned.

It has been centuries since anyone dared practice the Old Ways openly, and only the barest few even do so in secret. Lily Potter was one such, with her strong gifts and her open mind, and it was this that allowed her to empower her love enough to turn back even the deadliest of curses. The Dursleys' determined ordinariness coupled with the wards set by Albus Dumbledore (who knew and disapproved of Lily's practices) cut her son off from this aspect of his birthright, but now something has changed, and he will discover that magic is so much more than he knew...

** /Child,/ the magic whispered faintly, curled around the young man but barely heard. /You can make better wards then that by binding to the land, the soil, the blood of the land./ The young man in question barely heard it, having long learned to never listen to any voices not his own. He trusted Hermione to provide adequate protection to the tent and at any rate, it was hardly his area of expertise. He was less stubborn in following his impulses however, and found himself absentmindedly tracing runes with his want. /There, that's better,/ the land seemed to hum, as fog was created in a wide area around them, and cold tongues seemed to lick his hair. And face. Harry shivered and went in, but not before making the symbols into stone and carving some into the trees -althought covered so it would be invisible to others-. For a few seconds he thought he saw Lily, and a cauldron and a small fireplace and pillars with runes and symbols. Then he blinked and it was gone.

On the ground, there was a letter. It hadn't been there before, Harry was sure of it. On the letter was what might have been blood and it looked very very old. He opened it automatically.

*Dear Harry,

If you read this, you have discovered my legacy. Which probably means Dumbledore's protection wasn't enough. Bugger. He means well, he really does, but he never trusted what he can't fully understand, and he always thought runes were unreliable as the main protection. Might interfere with the newer magic, he always said. We let him do his thing and on his request used as little Old Magic as possible. He does not know the little ritual we performed last night, but I'd imagine he suspects, considering the circumstances. Our final protection. He has never approved of my brand of magic and was most vehemenently against blood magic. Frankly, I do not blame him. It really /is/ a last resort.

You probably don't know much about runes. They do teach some at Hogwarts (where I hope you'll go) but it's not unlike learning magic from Disneyfilms.* (Harry snorted wetly at that) /I suppose a explanation is in order. The magic you learn at Hogwarts isn't the be-all-end-all of magic. In the days of old it was apprentice-based and if you had the aptitude, you could continue to Avalon. But before that, priests and priestresses selected their novices by themselves and took them to Avalon. This was before the protections where in place and anyone could still visit them. Girls where more often chosen because they where seen as the spare so parents would be more likely to allow it. It was a respectable job, being a Healer from Avalon. People/ knew /you and you gained more respect than solely being married to someone. Naturally, the novices didn't believe in magic but in tricks and herbs and they didn't need tea-leaves to see either. The best saw the events of the day in a muddy pool, or a pudding. Tea-leaves were for novices to focus (unfortunately it became a crutch for most). But the High-Priestesses showed them magic to heal small cuts and mend bones to use if they could get away with it. This was the first milestone for most. Then, of course, they learned more. Mostly all-purpose stuff, thought some focused on certain types of magic; wards, woods, healing, things like that. They didn't use wants. Believe it or not, back then almost everyone was wandless. Then the Romans came. We had *not/ seen this coming. I dream of then sometimes, you know. Even thought I never saw them. How they rape the women before killing them. How they shoot the men in the back, my love in a past live one of them. They said we had to pray to /their gods/ and no-one elses. They saw* all /wandless magic as wrong and 'primitive'. The Wand-bearers spread among us like a virus. You know how it goes; they got high positions, married native women and so on. Magic is fairly sentient. It kept the memories from that time but it obeyed the wand-bearers just as well. Wands were for the nobles, back then; a status-symbol more than a tool. It was much,/ much /later that they became common./ (Harry saw (imagined?) young men using knifes and swords as foci, scratching runes and bewitching them. There was a icy plain and a three-pointed spear involved, thought he couldn't really see the connection, and a young boy with hair white as snow, before he was back on his campsite) /When they did, the Romans had already fallen and much more from the elite became common, like wine and a better infrastructure. There came more churches and, slowly but surely, less respect for the Healers of Avalon. More fathers prefered to send their daughters to convents/priories instead./

I will say that this isn't very Roman, they loved to adapt stuff to their culture. Their gods were just Roman ones, in a different form. Like Odin was actually another form of Mercury, doncha know? They only really started stamping things out under the Roman Catholic church, which was about 250ish years after Roman conquest of Britain.

That said it's a minor point, as Constantius II and his fellows would love to stamp out non-christian magics like that. Nothing has to change, beyond that.
