Hello,

I am looking for a Snamione Fanfic I once read. I do not recall the name or a lot about it (been YEARS). I do know Dumbledore sets Hermione on a task using a time turner. I remember her aging a lot due to this, so much so that she becomes an order member (or Hogwarts staff maybe?) And no one recognizes her and she wears her hair kind of funny. During one of the times she goes back I think she is captured and has to do a lot of fighting and possibly was locked in a cage? During "present time" she ends up becoming friends with Snape.

Does this sound familiar to anyone and do you have a link?

  In her sixth year, Dumbledore makes Hermione a key figure in a plan to help Harry defeat Voldemort. (It's difficult to summarize this without spoilers--- HG/SS; there's a Time Turner involved but probably not how you expect; the story really gets started in Chapter Three.)
