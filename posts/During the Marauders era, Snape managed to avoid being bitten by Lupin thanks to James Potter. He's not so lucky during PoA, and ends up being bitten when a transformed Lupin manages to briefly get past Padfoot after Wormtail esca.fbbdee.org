#+TITLE: During the Marauders era, Snape managed to avoid being bitten by Lupin thanks to James Potter. He's not so lucky during PoA, and ends up being bitten when a transformed Lupin manages to briefly get past Padfoot after Wormtail escapes.

** I'm not the biggest fan of such twists but maybe that would be interesting. Remus would be devastated and would most probably leave. Snape would obviously stay. The question is if Umbridge would figure out his secret and what would Dumbledore do if she did. Voldemort might not be so fond of a werewolf Snape.

** He would not reveal Lupin's secret, Mad-Eye/Barty would never become Defense teacher, because Lupin would continue his job and someone would totally notice if he was suddenly somebody else, total AU after PoA. Also: this calls for some bestiality a/b/o dynamic slash

**** I hate A/B/O so much. Especially since people think it's based on 'science' of wolves when it's not. It was disproven by the very man that 'discovered' it.

*** He would definitely reveal Lupin's secret. He'd probably even blame Lupin despite he himself choosing to leave to Wolfsbane potion behind.

**** I think not wanting to reveal his own secret would be a stronger motivation than blaming Lupin. After all he would have a really hard time, first losing his job and then having probably problems to find a job again, former deatheater and werewolf is really a bit too much.
