Feels like I've exhausted most of the good Star Wars crossover fics, and a decent chunk of Avengers crossovers too. Looking for something new, if it exists. Bonus points for comedy, completed works or active updates preferred.


** Have you tried the Son of the Archer series? It's about baby Ron being abducted by Death Eaters at the end of the first wizarding war, and ending up being saved by Clint "Hawkeye" Barton -- and because nobody can find his real family and Ron is too young to talk, he ends up being adopted by Clint and grows up on the SHIELD helicarrier.

The first story in the series has the most Avengers content, as it takes place in America and the events of the first Avengers movie are going on while Ron has his own subplot-adventure. I really like it for two reasons:

1: Someone other than Harry gets the spotlight. Harry doesn't even appear in the first story; he's introduced in the second and becomes a major character but the story is still more about Ron.

2: It really shows what it might be like to be a kid raised by a SHIELD agent and living in the most high-tech security bases in the world: Ron is taught self-defence and picks up a number of skllls from the various agents (and Dr Strange even introduces him to magic), but he's never turned into a mini-agent or action hero at the age of ten. When Loki attacks New York, the adults' reaction isn't "get him, Ron!" it's "SOMEONE GET THAT KID TO SAFETY!!"

The second story moves to Hogwarts, the Avengers content is sort of dowplayed and it gets a little too canon-rehashy for my tastes, but the first story at least is worth checking out!

*** Unfortunately, this suffers from the same problem Caroline Cooney's Janie series does. The bio family are unreasonable dicks who don't care about the kid, only what they think the kid should be. Of course, then there's anger and resentment all round when the kid doesn't slot readymade into the family.

Going to court over custody was ridiculous. Banning Clint from the Burrow was ridiculous. I personally believe Weasleys would fall over themselves in gratitude to Clint. Motherfucking Bellatrix had Ron! Ron was raised well, happy and safe. Instead, Molly was so unreasonable, she refused to let Ron keep his own clothes. His own clothes. Instead, he had to wear ill-fitting hand me downs. Nope, unrealistic.

**** Mmm... I agree that the Weasleys should have taken some time to ask Ron what HE wanted instead of just taking him back home and expecting him to be thrilled, but in this instance I can understand them. In their minds they ARE doing what is best for Ron... that was something I actually appreciated here; both parties are concerned about what's best for the child, it's just that they have very different ideas about what IS best for the child.

The Weasleys' initial reaction to Clint make sense if you look at it from their point of view. At first, they had no idea that Clint had saved Ron from Bellatrix; for all they knew Clint was the kidnapper and Ron was suffering from Stockholm syndrome. When the truth came out, the relationship between Clint and the Weasleys had been soured. They do try to make up for it and are quite civil to one another later on, but that first misunderstood interaction soured the relationship.

  Sequel to Child of the Storm. Harry's life has changed a lot over the past year, what with the return of his father, Thor, murder attempts by everything from HYDRA assassins to Elder Gods keeping him on his toes and making a few new friends. But while Chthon and HYDRA are gone, all sorts of dark things have been stirred up, things thought long gone. And guess who they're after...

  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.

** The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/348479][Under The Moon Series]] by Mercia is probably one of my most favorite HP and MCU crossover to date. It starts off Loki crashing into a pond near Luna's home. He bonds with young Luna for a bit but soon finds out that the child was a blind. Thus he gives her a gift of sight which, in this AU, apparently was the origins of Luna's invisible creatures that she can only see in addition to that sight. Eventually, after Loki had left, Luna was kidnapped by HYDRA. Afterwards, the plot progresses with her story and how she had grown in an oppressed environment without breaking. It's actually a bit dark, but there are some light hearted moments that simply makes me smile.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7ltati/recommendation_under_the_moon_series/?st=JF8KRLXY&sh=8be84bc6][I even made a post about it here.]]

I will also link the FF.net and Ao3 of the first book both if you prefer either one.

  "But Loki decided that only the other moon was really worth mentioning." Luna sees too little(none at all) and then too much. Loki needs a hug. But if you close your eyes (does it almost feel like nothing's changed at all? PART ONE of the Under the Moon Series.

  After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Expect a long story with some extra faces along the way.
