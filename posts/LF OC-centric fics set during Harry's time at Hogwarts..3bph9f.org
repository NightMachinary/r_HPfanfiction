** I've got one I'm writing although it's still in it's planning stages at the moment so it won't be public for awhile now. /But/ when it's happening, I'll make sure to post it here (so long as I can remember and find my way back to this page, that's why I'm commenting now, so I can go back through my comments and find my way here)

A little bit of info on the story:

It's about the daughter of Bellatrix and Rodolphus Lestrange. In the story, Aurors destroy the Lestrange's home during the duel when they are arresting them (the house burns down) and Kreacher (with his undying loyalty to Bellatrix) comes to the rescue. So Vega (that's the girl's name) is raised by Kreacher in Grimmauld Place with no human contact (although Walburga dies in 1985 I believe).

Also, growing up with Kreacher and hearing constantly of him hero-worshipping the late Regulus Black tends to give a person the same sort of mindset, so... Yeah.

There is more but I'm afraid I'd spoil too much.
