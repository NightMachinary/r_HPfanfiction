Harry got a pretty standard one with six compartments, each as big as the entire trunk. Hermione's has a small library inside. Ron has to use an old one that's only twice as large on the inside as on the outside. And Draco's gold-plated ebony monstrosity is equipped with a small luxurious apartment and it can hover around and follow him, and he doesn't even brag about it because it's nothing special for rich wizard kids.

Because expanded trunks are super useful so there's no reason not to have one, and that applies to everyone and not just indy!Harry.


** Your info was outdated. Harry's trunk was big enough to fit entire Europe inside. He use it grow all types of crops and also to mine rare gems and gold.

  When Zelretch conducts an experiment and the being known to all as Fate intervenes Harry Potter's life is changed irrevocably. Now being raised by those who don't fit the definition of 'Normal' it is a very different Harry that is unleashed on the world. Or is it worlds? Disclaimer: This is fan fiction, I only own the plot.

*** It is a lot easier to find something misplaced in a trunk than in a bag. And yes, summoning spells are possible but it would be hard for younger students to learn an advanced spell like that.

One pet peeve I have is when an author writes that the main character has a expandable truck but they shrink it and carry around in their pocket all the time. I feel like a shrinking charm and an expanding charm would cancel each other out in some catastrophic way.

I don't think so. Since the expanding charm clearly only affects the inside and the outside is unaffected I doubt what charms are placed on the outside would count.

** I sometimes wonder why wizards even build houses. Between crazy ass tents and trunks there's no reason to have a house. You could have a mansion in a tent and it's mobile. If you just let people apporate in to a foyer area they'd never have to know they were in a tent.

*** Making things smaller on the inside could also be useful. Dig a tunnel from Diagon to Hogsmeade, enchant it to be smaller on the inside so that it's just 1 centimeter long, and you have a portal between the locations that doesn't spin you around like crazy when you step through.
