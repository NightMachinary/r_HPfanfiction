** TheDivineComedian on Ao3 has some brilliant Remus and Sirius stories. linkao3(Calibration) springs to mind. All of their stories are fantastic though.

linkao3(Remus Lupin and the Prisoner of Azkaban) is also brilliant. Exactly what it says on the tin but very well written I loved it.

  Remus's mind is usually a tidy place. The worst has already happened, what's left to be scared of? His fears are labelled, annotated, and most of all, archived. For one evening, though, he'll have to let them come out and play. (Remus prepares the Boggart for his lesson with the third years. Featuring Severus Snape as an unwanted critic, and Sirius Black as the elephant in the room.)

** If you haven't read it already "All the Young Dudes" - holy shit this an amazing, bittersweet wolfstar story. I loved it so much, even when it curbstomped my heart.

** Fernwithy's fics on Remus are brilliant. Fits neatly into canon. He's a muggle history teacher in that series.

*** Glad someone else likes them. I never found any other fics similar to those unfortunately so have nothing else to read:)

**** They're the perfect blend of happy and morose moments, and canon compliant and well written and have great plots. They don't make them like that often.
