Complete fic from a while back.

Harry runs away from the Durselys to where the circus parks for performance. Petunia called them freaks so he went, got adopted by a gay couple, Harry learns circus tricks.

One of his fathers was from a tribe and his dad 'disowned' him.

Sirius, Remus, Severus interaction.

Harry isn't known as Harry so those ppl know him as someone else.

Selkies - Harry befriends one and I think at one point they're intimate?

Werewolves appear and Harry chucks a nut or something at him pretending it wasn't him. The guy notices and Harry just hugs him because Harry is a fluff ball.

The story does go from kid to teen Harry where eventually he reveals himself as Harry... at a rave or something? Harry always has a scarf/hat on when interacting with ppl.

I think it might be a Harry/Draco but not sure.

Harry does train... I think with a vampire or something? There's a council of creatures that back him up...

Any help would be appreciated. It's really long and a few years old. Thanks üôèüôè

Summary: 5-year-old Harry Potter overhears his aunt complaining to his uncle about the "freaks" camping nearby. Maybe if they are the same type of "freak" he is they will want him?

Pairings: HP/DM, HP/OMC, Severus/OMC, Remus/OMC/OFC, Remus/Sirius and others as the story progresses

Warnings: Under 18 - Harry is still at school. AU, mentions of child abuse, Slash, Violence, Sexual Situations, powerful Harry, manipulative Dumbledore, there are chapters with vampire blood play, het, threesome, and third person remembering of non-con and murder of children. I will give warnings before those chapters so it can be skipped over if you want. Despite these warnings it really isn't a dark story, if you have questions feel free to contact me.


** I'm kind of confused. Everyone is saying it's complete but it shows only 5/83 chapters. The author also says in their note that it's complete, but there are 83 chapters so it'll take a while to upload them all. Is there somewhere to actually get all 83 chapters or did the author somehow wrap it up in 5 chapters?

It sounds like an awesome story idea, but it hurts my heart when I get pulled into an abandoned story. I don't want to get into this only to be sad about it later. üòÖ So, is it complete or is it just complete in theory but not uploaded?

*** It is an older story that used to be called ‚ÄúGypsy Caravan.‚Äù The author renamed it and reuploaded it. For some reason it's in 5 chapters now instead of 83 individual ones on AO3, but if you look at the chapter titles, you'll see that the first AO3 chapter contains chapters 1-20 (or something like that), the second contains 20-40, etc etc. So all 83 of them are there, in the five AO3 ‚Äúchapters.‚Äù I haven't read it since it was revised and reuploaded, because I saved the old version and read that instead, but I assume this strange structure has something to do with the revision.

*** Yes!!!

I remember scenes of him finding a snake somewhere near a temple? It was very well written and flushed out with randomness.

I hope I find it, I'll post here.
