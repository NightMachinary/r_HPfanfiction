** Enembee is one of the most under-rated authors in the fandom. Which is sad because his works are some of the best the fandom has to offer.

The Forests of Valbone is an excellent fic, but I would say that his other works are even better. linkffn(The Skitterleap) is one of the best AU fics I've ever read (although it is sadly incomplete), while linkffn(By the Divining Light; Conlaodh's Song) are also brilliant stories that feature a prodigious Harry who is mentored by Dumbledore.

I highly recommend all of his fics, especially if you are a lover of AU as I am.

  Fifty years ago, Grindelwald won the duel that shaped the world. In a land overwhelmed by darkness, a hero emerges: a young wizard with the power, influence and opportunity to restore the light. Harry Potter, caught up in a deadly game of cat and mouse, must decide what he truly believes. Does this world deserve redemption? Or, more importantly, does he?

  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.
