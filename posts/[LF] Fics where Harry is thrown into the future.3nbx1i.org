I'm a bit bored with Harry going back in time but I still like reading my time travel fics.\\
Does anyone know of some decent fics where he is sent into the future?


** This would be really cool but I can't think of anything that fits the bill.

Have you thought about switching it up and reading fics where other people travel through time? Or maybe a groundhog day fics? They could quench your thirst for time travel without being the same thing over and over again.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

*** I only know of 2 that involve anyone going into the future, 3003 by gilthas and a firefly crossover. Neither of them are anything special though.

I've read a lot of time travel fics about several different characters but the problem I'm having at the moment is I'm just bored by the past. And groundhog day fics are only really fun for the first few and last few chapters.

I'm really just hoping to find something different and figured that the best place would be in the future. It's a setting where authors don't have a set guideline for story progression so a lot of it would need to be fresh and new.

*** I'm probably gonna read the whole thing but I'm about 10 chapters in and it's a really bad Harry Potter story because the author does a poor job of understanding who Harry is. Harry doesn't kill yet this story has him just jump right into killing things and doesn't touch on the topic. He's also super intelligent, sarcastic, and rude. While the intelligence is explained in the story the sarcasm and rudeness goes way beyond what he is in the books.

Also the author used the word glomped nonsarcastically

** linkffn(11157943)

It's a Star Wars crossover. How he got there is a mystery, but he definitely lived in "the past" and now lives as a badass bounty hunter in a futuristic society. The fic is slow as fuck, with the 11 chapters covering like 2 days, and it has bad habit of the females going on and on about how mysterious Harry is, but it has its moments and the premise is too juicy not to enjoy. Oh and it's unfinished ofc.
