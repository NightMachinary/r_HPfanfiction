While out of 346,241 stories marked as completed 257,191 haven't been updated since the day they were uploaded.

That means for fics marked as complete only 89,050 of them were updated after they were posted.


** As a quick question, I'm too lazy to check myself but what proportion of completed fics are considerd one-shots? Only multi-chaptered fics would require updates to upload new chapters and that relies on the assumption that they haven't been pre-written and uploaded in one chuck.

*** I'm starting to wonder if I should learn how to Database, I got these numbers as a side effect of trying to set up an update.

On Archive.org there is a 2015 scrape of fanfiction.net [[/u/nerdguy1138]] was nice enough to format it into something reasonable instead of needing to download all 111G of it.

Nothing has been updated since then, and I'm hoping to come up with a sane way to do it (For Harry Potter at least)
