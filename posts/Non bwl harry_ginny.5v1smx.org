I am not a big fan of this ship but I'd figure try it. One where harry is just a normal bout


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4577618/Brennus][Brennus]] wrote several H/G fics that have them meet each other much later or even after the War. Ginny in those fics did not have crushes on Harry at all. She was down right hostile when first meeting Harry in "Hail Odysseus".

His stories are generally fine, but bashing of Dumbledore and other Weasleys could be severe.

--------------

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10099028/1/Murder-Most-Horrid][Murder Most Horrid]], linkffn(10099028), there is no Voldemort. The story itself is pretty good, but Harry and Ginny are only minor characters.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], Harry is non BWL and Ginny plays an important role, but they are not together. In fact, they are mortal enemies.

Otherwise, I haven't found any non BWL H/G fics I like.

** Most of the ones where he isn't the BWL kinda suck, or at least the ones I've read.

Here is one in the more typical wbwl vein linkffn(Sixteen Years by Council) is enjoyable, although I would say it is more for the bombastic magic than anything else.
