I'm looking for a story that was posted on Fanfiction.net. I saw it in a Google search about a month or two ago, so I believe it's still up. It starts with Harry burning his possessions in the Great Hall. There's an attack on the Dursley's, Harry trains with a man named Forge who has a well of sorts that he can use to see what's happening. There's time travel, the Queen of England is in the story at some point, either Harry or Neville is called Gabriel. Oh and Harry uses a purple potion called Blood of Jericho or something.

That's all I can remember. Any help is greatly appreciated.

Edit: Oh and Harry presents Neville, Dumbledore, Ginny and/or with weapons in the Chamber of Secrets. I think that's from the same story anyway.
