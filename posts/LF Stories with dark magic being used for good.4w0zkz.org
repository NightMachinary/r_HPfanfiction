I am sure I have read a story about this before but I can't really remember the details.

I am looking for any stories which has someone (maybe one of the main 'good guys') using/mastering dark magic for good purposes.


** Linkffn(The Sum of Their Parts by holdmybeer). An excellent post-DH fic with good Trio characterization and dark magic used for good. It really needs a sequel because of the awesome world it sets up.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.

** The issue with using darkness to do good is the slippery slope. the first time you use imperius to stop a suicide bomber. The next time it's well intentioned too. But eventually you'll use imperius to force someone to do what you want: give you their money, perform sexually, betray their friends. The road to hell is paved with good intentions.

#+begin_quote
  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
