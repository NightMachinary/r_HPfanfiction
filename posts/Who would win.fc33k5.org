You know how in Game of Thrones, there are the white walkers and the wights, what would have happend if you were to send an army of inferis against them? Who would win? Just an idea I got for a crossover fic with a dark Harry.


** So far as we know wights can only be taken down by fire, dragon glass, and valyrian steel. We don't know that inferi have similar strengths.

I would say in a straight fight wights would win. If Harry can somehow equip the inerfi with dragon glass? That comes down to the tactics of Harry vs white walkers.

*** We do know that Inferi also fear fire, so they couldn't use it as a tool either.

** If we have a two way portal to the GoT-verse with the ability to get more supplies from the HP-verse, then how about obsidian bullets in enchanted guns? Wights have big numbers, so fast firing machine guns would be ideal.

Should be possible to use some of the Potter inheritance to get the guns on the black market, enchant them to magically duplicate obsidian bullet ammo and to not overheat, and bring them to the GoT-verse. Inferi won't work well because they're not intelligent enough to learn how to use advanced weapons.

If the portal is large enough, how about a small tank enchanted to be invisible and to fly? GoT doesn't have much aviation besides dragons, so a few flying tanks that are armored enough to ignore almost all the weapons of GoT could take over the entire world.

** Depends on the initial conditions, but if we are talking about zero prep time, with randomly chosen 100 inferi vs 100 wight, with no guidance from White Walkers or Wizards apart from starting the fight, 9 out of 10 time wights would win. Assuming wights and inferi has basically the same physical strength, it would come down to weapons and statistically it's more likely that some of those wights would have swords, axes and stuff.

** If I was Harry, I would just make magical version of grenades stuffed with dragon glass and BOOOOM... problem solved.

** Neither would win the Night King would claim the inferi and add them to his wights.

They are dead after all so it would be the Irish meeting the Scots Braveheart Style.

*** But the wizard has a control over the inferi so wouldnt there be a fight between minds?
