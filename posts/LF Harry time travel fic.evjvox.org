Looking for something complete that sends Harry back further than his parents time. Anything with him going to fight/join Grindelwald or some time before that. Preferably he goes alone and bonus points if he meets his ancestors.


** Men of War by LadyBraken is exactly what you are looking for. It is a WIP slash fic though romance has not started yet. It is only being updated on ao3 though.

  Instead of a somewhat happy childhood with his mother, Percy is orphaned and on the streets by the age of ten. Found and taken in by the most unlikely of gods, Percy is raised to be the greatest demigod to ever live. His past has left him bitter towards all but a few. Will he still be ready to accept his destiny? AU of Percy's life. Complete!
