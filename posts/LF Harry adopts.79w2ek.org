** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11965672/1/Terminal-Justice-by-Overkill-AKA-Irrational-Intelligence]])

Honestly cannot remember too much about this one. Harry is OP in this one, but I think it was pretty fun.

An unofficial continuation of the "make a wish" universe created by Rorschach's Blot.

I definitely remember Harry adopting Raven I think. It was towards the end of the story though, and probably doesn't really go into the depth you are looking for.

If I think of something better I will come back and post. Sorry if this doesn't really fit the bill.

  The unofficial fourth of the Make a Wish series by Rorschach's Blot, it was originally written by Overkill aka Irrational Intelligence and removed for some reason. EDIT: Have separated the chapters now.

Rons whole thing is loyalty unless it looks like he's been lied to. In POA Hermione didn't give a rats ass about crookshanks evidently eating scabbers. This is Ron, who has grown up in relative poverty and can safely say has almost no personal possessions except his Chudely Cannons memerobilia. In his eyes Hermione s pet ate a rat that's been in the family for twelve years. You get attached to pets. He's personally owned scabbers for two years. When she disregards scabbers death she disregards Ron's attachment to scabbers. It's incredibly shortsighted and selfish, which is fair game for Ron to be both hurt and angry.
