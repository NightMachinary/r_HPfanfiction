** How do you feel about total AU's? This fic captures his character really well, although its quite incomplete and definitely different from the usual stories featuring Tom Riddle.

linkffn(Blurring Reality)

And I know the summary sounds really silly, but it's really good, well written and gets super intense at times and not what you expect from the summary. It's about a dance school putting on a performance called "the prophecy" thats basically the plot of canon events. It's a story of double meanings and parallels between the plot, the characters performing the play, their canon counterparts, the events going on in the dance school and canon universe. As time goes on, the characters start losing their grip with reality and the parallels between them and their canon selves become more apparent. Focuses on Harry and Tom Riddle who are both fantastic in this fic.

  Tom Riddle, top student of the prestigious Hogwarts School for Dance. Albus Dumbledore, searching for the hero in his famous end of year performance by holding open auditions. Harry Potter, attending said auditions only to listen to the live music for free. Severus Snape, dance instructor, tolerating nothing but perfection. The line between imagination and reality, a fickle thing.

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.

A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight.
