Looking for the most over the top Ancient and Noble Harry is the second coming of whoever. Just be over 100k words and complete.


** Hero trilogy by Joe something on ffnet. Written when he was young, so not the most professional, but a good read and fits your description. All three are long, and complete.

Edit: Joe6991. Check out his time travel au as well, is better written but only 1 and 1/2 out of two books so it's incomplete
