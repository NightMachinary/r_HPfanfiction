Blatantly stolen from [[https://archiveofourown.org/chapters/26470377?show_comments=true&view_adult=true#comments][this fic]], it's a sentiment I would have liked to see more often.

There are far too many stories where being evil is simply a survival strategy. After all, bad guys get a slap on the wrist if even that, good guys mourn their dead in silence at best. More often, the very organizations they saved, like Ministry or Gringotts, make it their top priority to twist the knife. Charged with using dark magic? attacking Aurors, nevermind who they served? vandalizing bank property? stealing from Gringotts?

All too often, the end result is Order of the Paupers, or Prisoner of Azkaban: the Return.

It creates an impression that law only applies when it's time to punish the heroes and reward the villains. Disgusting.

What I'd like to see is any instance of the Sunk Cost Fallacy being defied, characters saying: "We have sacrificed enough!" - and prioritizing their own wellbeing over pride or perceived responsibility.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11831304/1/A-Father-First-Damn-It][A Father First]] features just that with James as the main character. Have any of you seen more?


** I wrote an HP/2012/nBSG cross called linkffn(Invincible) where Harry literally took that position when saving the world. He used almost those very words, though his definition of “mine” did expand with time.

  "You are gathered here today because the world is going to end within the next three years," Hermione said succinctly. "But my husband, having died before, is in no hurry to do so again. We are here to try and save wizard kind itself." A Harry Potter/Battlestar Galactica Crossover, with a touch of 2012 fused in for the fun of it. Obviously not Epilogue Compliant.

** Linkffn(Weary Wizard) is the only one I can think of. Harry, Hermione and Sirius are disillusioned and abandon Britain.
