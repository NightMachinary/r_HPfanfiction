Romance or non romance. What I'm looking for is anything Harry and LORD VOLDEMORT. Not Harry and Tom (although I quite love those, but I've read many). Either he joins Voldemort or falls in love for him, or both, I'm game for anything as long as we have a reasonably in character Voldemort interacting with Harry. I'd love it if there were long ones. Thanks so much!

PS; Yes, I'm well aware is a "shocking" pairing, yes there is quite a lot more to it than just slash, please don't comment saying I'm sick for liking the ship, if you wanna understand better why I like it feel free to ask. Thank you.


** I recommend ObsidianPen's work and EgyptianDreamer's Game Over. Brainstorm001([[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/1363088/]]) has some completed long stories. TheFictionist's work is also great but I can't remember if some of them are HPTR. Would love to see more recommendation as well.

*** Thanks so much! Will check it right away. When you search for lists and groups with HPTR recs is all about time travel and schoolboy Tom, I'd like to see the dynamic between HPLV for once ^{-^}
