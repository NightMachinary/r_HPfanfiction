I usually hate 1st person and tend to avoid fics using it. But after re-reading The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole and getting a plot bunny for the latest SIYE challenge, I'm going to give it a try in a diary-style humour fic.

What do you guys think of these sort of fics? Do you have any tips or pet peeves associated with them?


** I haven't written much first person, but as a reader I've found it really seperates the good and average writers. Personally I feel like if done right, a first person story could almost be better than any third person narration story, yet its a lot easier to screw up. Third person seems to be a lot more forgiving.

You have to really get into the character in first person. Its really good for stories where the main character will have a lot of internal dialogue and their thoughts are key to the story. Since it is seeing from a single perspective, you will have to do all your other character development through dialogue. This is harder to do, but when done properly comes across as more natural.

Like I said, I haven't done a lot of first person writing myself but this is what I've noticed about it. I think that a lot of people use first person for self insert style stories which tend to be lower quality and that's what gives it a somewhat bad reputation.

*** Agreed on all points. First person stories tend to be either truly spectacular marvels or horrible flops, and there's almost no middle ground. That, I think makes it quite a bit more difficult than third person, where, as you said, it's more forgiving, so there's a lot more leeway for average (+/- a couple standard deviations) stories to still be fairly well-received.

And I especially agree about the dialogue. One thing I've noticed in a lot of the very best first-person POV stories is that they're dialogue-heavy, another skill that can be a challenge for writers.

**** I'm concerned about this, as it's a diary style fic written in the style of the Adrian Mole series. There isn't a lot of dialogue at all :/

***** I myself don't really like diary style fics so I can't really give much advice on this. I would suggest making sure you really put a lot into the main characters personality. Lots of inner dialogue sort of. Other than that it will be hard to do. Best of luck!

***** Ah -- well that's a bit of a different beast. I'm not familiar with Adrian Mole, unfortunately, and I'm trying to think of other good epistolary novels, because there definitely are some, and some that I've read in HP fanfiction. People like to cite Per Solum Lucana (super-long Harry/Draco fic) since that has a ton of letter-writing between the main characters, but I actually didn't like that one (mostly due to other aspects of the author's writing style -- it was too stiff and disconnected, the dialogue felt unnatural, things like that IIRC).

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2345300][The Very Secret Diary]] was a great one, but that does (in a way) feature dialogue between Ginny and Tom Riddle.

Other good epistolary works (non-HP): Dracula, The Diary of Anne Frank, The Martian, and possibly my favorite -- Cloud Atlas. Cloud Atlas contains multiple good contemporary examples; it's a set of six stories that all relate to each other in small ways. Two of them are epistolary format -- The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing and Letters from Zedelghem. The latter really tugged at my heartstrings, but I enjoyed both of them. In Letters, the character had a casual eloquence that occasionally surfaced when he was particularly heartfelt about a topic (e.g. his music).

For an epistolary novel to work, I think you again need to have great understanding and command of your viewpoint character(s). A large problem I see with this kind of writing is that authors forget their character's inner voice, which is what really needs to shine, especially in a letter or diary. There are probably going to be some tangents. The sentences may not be complete. Maybe your character injects some nuance into his/her writing by assigning everyone they write about a nickname, or adopting an amusing penname of their own (e.g. Draco Malfoy, King of Slytherin).

Often, characters just sound completely flat though. And any long-time journaler (er, well, this one at least!) will attest that their diaries don't read like a newspaper article or a course essay, and while it's easy to think, "Well of course not," it's easy to forget once you start writing. A diary is the exact place for your character to unleash all those thoughts they wouldn't otherwise give voice to, and I think it's important to remember that. There's all manner of emotions to explore and express, and furthermore -- I think it's important to remember that people don't usually write when all they have to say is, "I went to class. I had beef stew for lunch. Potions was funny since Longbottom blew up another cauldron." They tend to write about something in particular that happened to them (an event that took place or some emotional upheaval, etc.) or which they can't dismiss from their heads (getting over the death of someone, trying to figure out why they like somebody's company).

Ok, that was basically a book unto itself. Sorry for the ramble, and if it was disjointed.

** I tend not to like this perspective either. It's hard to set new plot hooks from such a limited POV without resorting to stock phrases such as 'an unreadable look,' thus making conflict far more difficult to portray than the 'standard' third-person limited.

That being said, I can count several first-person /original/ fiction stories among my favourites. I'm rereading one right now, /Robinson Crusoe/, that does a masterful job at telling an engaging story. So here are some quick and dirty tips from someone who has never written one in his life:

- Decide immediately what tense you're going to use: past or present. Past is probably easier for authors experimenting with the genre for the first time.

- Showing, not telling is /even more important/ than the other types of POVs. Practise using /concise/ but vivid imagery to describe settings, characters, and especially moods so that the reader isn't separated from the action/emotion and is therefore better able to identify with your protagonist.

- Get a beta reader who is going to be on the lookout for narrator omniscience. Or, if you don't feel comfortable having someone else go through this experiment with a fine-toothed comb, then as you edit, constantly ask yourself: 'How does the protagonist /know/ this?'

- Make your narrative voice match your protagonists speaking style. If they're naturally verbose and chatty, then feel free to use flowing descriptors. Don't mix and match. For example, how weird would it be for Hemingway-esque narration to accompany Faulkner-like dialogue?

Hope this helps. Great topic and good luck!

** I often find myself writing better in the first person. Go for it.

Make sure the perspective stays with that character. By going for first person, you are constraining yourself to that person's viewpoint, their knowledge, their biases. You are furthermore constraining them to what they knew in the moment. You can ease this restriction by adding a frame to the story and referencing that frame. Or if you're writing in the past tense, you might be able to use an implicit frame, sort of. It works out like:

#+begin_quote
  "What's going on?" I asked Bella.

  She wouldn't meet my eyes. "Nothing. Just -- Sirius, don't talk to me. Stay on your Gryffindor side and forget I exist."

  I thought she was just embarrassed to be seen with her kid cousin. Later, I realized it was the last time she spoke to me as Bellatrix Black, my cousin, and just before she put the Death Eater mask over her soul.
#+end_quote

An explicit reference /(later, I realized)/ to an implicit frame (I didn't start out with "It was the summer of 1995, and I was sitting down to talk to Harry about the rest of the family" or anything like that). It's clear that Sirius is retelling this story from a later perspective and including some of that information.

Consistency is good -- if you have an conceit that the story is someone's diary, you can include inline retrospectives the person would have realized before writing that diary entry, for instance, but not stuff they wouldn't have realized for years.

** For original novels I prefer first person because it really gets me into the head of the character- for some reason the minutiae of someone's life is infinitely more interesting to me if read in first person.

For fanfics, I mostly don't like it at all. I feel like the character already has a voice and if it doesn't match very closely to canon I'm much less forgiving than if the fic was in third person. For self inserts or OCs it can be fine though.

** I am currently writing a fic in 1st person, after thinking about why my 3rd person fic didn't quite work and experimenting inspired by another 1st person fanfic I've read. First I didn't like them so much either - the canon is written in third person too! yadda yadda but when I got over my prejudice I really started loving it. It's perfect for unreliable narrators like children, teenagers and the mentally ill, in my opinion, but that's probably because it's my share of characters - with others it will also work very well if you really want to add a more personal, emotional touch to the characters we know from canon. I had a bit of a problem first with the question "who is the reader? Who are the characters telling this to?" but then I realized that no-one buys that JK Rowling could have known what was in Harry's head either if she was just a supposed "witness of the events". Overall I love first person fics if the pov fits the story and adds to it. You know, maybe you feel that your story is made for that perspective, then you should write it in it and it will only improve that way. What is an extra of first person viewpoint in my opinion is also that the reader can really be the characters or feel as if the characters are talking to them, or choose that the monologue is meant for another character. With third person there's no such thing.

About the tone of voice having to be right: I find that a bit odd seeing as we just don't know what the internal monologue is for the characters from canon, besides Harry's (so with first person perspective Harry fics I can understand it, then again, maybe he has changed, although the reason for it should then be explained). I respect it, but I think it's all subjective. Humor fics are always nice, I'd be interested in the fic when it's finished. With a diary, you already have a good explanation of why the fic is in first person perspective in the first place, but then there needs to be given a reason why the character has kept one and it should be in character for the character to keep one (unless there is an outside influence)

** I think 1st person is the most engaging when used properly. Jbern's "The Lie I've Lived" is a good example of this. I think it's best used when the fiction revolves heavily around the main character. It can really give the story good pacing; the reader can get a feel for what the mc's thoughts are during dialogue and duels without interrupting the flow with a separate narrator. 1st person seems to offer a more personal approach, like a tale told by the campfire. Jbern also uses 2nd person which seems a bit outlandish("Bungle In The Jungle") but it works well in my opinion.

*** I think "Catcher in the Rye" is 1st person and may owe some of its popularity to it. Seems more psychological reading a character's thought/intent directly rather than having it described 3rd hand all the time. May be the difference between empathy and sympathy. I could be completely full of shit of course. Just a general impression after reading so much of this hp fan fiction. I guess the most important thing you need in first person is an interesting main character.

** There's a 'Secret Diary of Adrian Mole' style story called linkffn(Six Feet of Ginger Idiot), which is a really good Romione Sixth-year fic. I don't normally read romance, but it's got a lot of humour and the perspective it's written from (and some of the phrasing) just made me think of a particular 13 3/4 year old.

Might be worth checking out, at least a little bit.
