Just wondering if anyone knows of any good fanfics where harry becomes the heir/lord of multiple house + hogwarts founders.

Thanks in advance.

Edit: If they also have more than a couple chapters that'd be great because I like the long read! :)


** Fics that include the 'lord too many names' trope tend to be bad, so finding a good one can be really hard, if not impossible.

Anyway, I will name one that I found amusing.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Four Founders by Darth Marrs)

It has the usual scratch-head-worthy elements (on top of everything , Harry is named Lord Hogwarts) but the writing is good. If you are into this kind of thing, I think you might like it.

*** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Four Founders by Darth Marrs)

It'll work if you don't capitalize the L!

Lately I really like linkffn(harry potter and the prince of slytherin). I thought I'd hate the Lord Potter Heir to Potter etc. thing but it's actually kind of fun and this fic in particular is really good!

  Everybody has a Wrong Boy Who Lived story in them, and everybody has a Slytherin!Harry story. This is mine for both. AU, currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NOTE: There will be NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year.

  In which Harry discovers there is more to being the Heir of the Four Founders than than just having really cool tattoos. Powerful Harry, Multi-Ship. Post OOTP. No Slash.
