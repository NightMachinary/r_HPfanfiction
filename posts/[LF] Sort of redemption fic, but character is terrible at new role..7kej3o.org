I read many fics where Snape adapts Harry and becomes best dad in the world. Sometimes Voldemort becomes great teacher or mentor.

But Snape has questionable character, and personal experience tells me that intelligent people with low sympathy and patience are not good teacher material.

So I want to find fics where bad characters try to redeem themselves but do terrible job at new role and are frustrated, or become a bad influence to Harry etc.

Thank you!


** linkffn(In blood only) This one fits. It's a severitus fic with Snape finding out that he is Harry's father and being very unhappy about it. It's hilarious at times and very well written. He is a terrible father figure most of the time and kind of fails even when he does attempt to be one. Mostly due to him having a very difficult time getting over hating Harry and his questionable morality views.

  Snape is Harry's father. No one is happy to hear it. [R due to colorful language, dark themes, and nongraphic violence.]

It isn't that ridiculous. Voldemort sure knows his craft, and we know Riddle had a lot of charisma and was very skilled socially.\\
Being evil and crazy doesn't necessarily make you a bad teacher.\\
Furthermore, we know that becoming the defence professor was once one of Riddle's ambitions so he at least has the vocation.

Seems to me like a better deal than almost all of Harry's defence professor at Hogwarts.

*** Yes he can be good teacher and I quite enjoy these fics. I'm just trying to find something diffrent this time because I never saw bad teacher Voldemort.

My knowledgeable, intelligent teacher was kinda bewildered because students didn't understand theories as fast as he did, and couldn't make logical connection as easily as he could. His class was like that owl drawing meme. Lol.

He tried to help students when they had problems but he needed students to explain about where and why they had problems because for him it's too natually logical to be confused. Students felt like idiot and shied away from the subject.

I felt sorry for him since he was one of the teachers who actually has a passion for their fields and he was depressed because of the teaching problem, but he was really not great at teaching.

** I really liked linkffn(11888152).

It takes place after the war, so Harry is already an adult. Snape has to deal with two things: Surviving when all he wanted was to die, and the fact that he is the biological father of a boy he directed his misplaced hatred onto for years. Harry is already reeling from the revelations of Snape's pensieve memories and this is another complication for him. Needless to say neither of them are happy about the situation and it takes a long time for them to get on the same page. I thought it was a more mature and nuanced take on the Severitus trope than most fics.

*** I finished it and quite liked it. Thank you! I think your point about it being mature and nuanced take on the Severitus really descritps it well. I'm surprised it didn't get more attention.

**** You're welcome! It's pretty great. I like that the power equation is more balanced in it since they're both adults in a post-war world, rather than Snape having all the authority because Harry is a minor. Yeah, so many good fics rarely get the attention they deserve. :/

  Voldemort is dead but Harry Potter's problems are far from over. Indeed, the very day after the battle, Harry Potter looks into a mirror and finds himself staring at a stranger and an old secret is brought to light. And what does this have to do with Severus Snape, still alive (unfortunately, as far as he is concerned) after being dragged out of the Shrieking Shack?
