Do you have any (potentially crack) fic where every once in a while the characters are singing about the current situation/plans etc.

It can be just a series of one shots that go through the canon, or entirely new and whole plotlines. I won't mind if the writer uses already created tunes, as long as the lyrics are changed to the story and the original song is somewhat fits the situations, but if there is no tune given, that's fine too.

It would be good if the music would either be comedic and/or advance the plot in a way.

TBH I don't have much hope, but if this promts someone to write a few chapters, I would like to read that too.

PS: I'm a Galavant fan, 4th wall breaking is acceptable too :)


** There are a few videos like this, have you tried looking on Youtube?

** HPMOR originally had the twins force Harry to sing the Ghostbusters theme song as he was walking to be sorted. It has since been edited out, though there probably is a copy out there somewhere.
