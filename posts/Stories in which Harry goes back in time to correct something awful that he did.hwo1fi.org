So, generally in time-travel stories we se Harry going back to deal with something other people did to him, fight again the war, this time without the child gloves or nullify some kind of threat that he didn't notice until it was to late...

Looking for stories in which instead he goes back to correct a choice he made that had horrible results.

F ex.: maybe he sided with Voldemort at the confrontation with Quirell and regretted it when the world went down in flames; maybe there was a reason why Dumbledore was so insistent on not killing everyone on the enemy's side and Harry only found out when he broke with him to start a slaughter that ended causing a bloodbath even greater than what Voldemort would have done -or otherwise somehow caused irreversible damage to the magical world-, maybe in a WBWL scenario he resented deeply his famous brother and let it stop him from helping in the fight against Voldemort, which led to either his sibling/family/friends dying or to another end-of-the-world case (would really like to see a regretful Harry with a WBWL sibling that looks back, finds cases in which his sibling tried to mend the rift between them, but he was to blind by resentment to see and spurned him).
