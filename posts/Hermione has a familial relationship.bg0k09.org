Looking for stories where Hermione has a familial relationship with Draco, Narcisssa/Lucius, Sirius and/or Snape. Love 'an unexpected Malfoy' linkffn(12659284) and the relationship she has there with the adults, also liked the relationship in 'Blinded by Lies linkffn(12972102) until the fic started dragging on and on... so looking for Hermione stories with family. She can be born a Black, or maybe a Malfoy, the goddaughter of Snape (or maybe Malfoy). Point is, I want stories where she has a good relationship with the Malfoys, Sirius and/or Snape. If she's in a relationship with Draco doesn't matter. As long as it's not Ron. I want it to take place during their Hogwarts years.

I've already read sleeper. :)

Thaaaank you!


** Limkffn(Accidental Betrothal) comes to mind. It was a bit too fluffy for my tastes but you might enjoy it.

  Hermione Granger and Draco Malfoy met years before either of them went to Hogwarts. She might not have been his first choice for a friend, but he couldn't ask for a better one. Even if her parents were muggles.

  Once upon a time Hermione Granger literally ran into Draco Malfoy in a bookshop. His mother sees a connection between her son and the muggleborn that she can't ignore and determines to get to know the girl. An imagining of how things could have gone if Hermione had been taken under the wing of the Malfoy family.

  That fateful Halloween night, Sirius makes a mistake that sends him running to adopt his niece through blood magic. Little Hermione becomes his salvation and his reason for living. Follow their story through Hermione's years at Hogwarts and through the second blood war. Slow-burn Harmony. Completely AU.
