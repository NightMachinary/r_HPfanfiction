I recently read and loved linkffn(The Sum of their Parts). It's got great character development and the setup of how one becomes a dark lord. In it there is a line which basically amounts to Harry discussing with his friends in a room and wondering if Voldemort also rose to power with something like this. Many closed door meetings with supporters and such.

I'm looking for any fics like that out there, about Voldemort's rise from his or one of his original follower's (Rookwood, Lucius, sane bella, Dolohov etc) Would love it if there's political moves and selective assassinations or bribes etc. Not the mindless bending people using power and violence.


** It is slash, but great character development and great view of voldemort's rise from the bottom to the top. Linkffn(their verdict of vagaries)

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** linkffn(The Evil Overlord List)

It's a comedic, interesting Tom learning from a voice inside his head.

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.
