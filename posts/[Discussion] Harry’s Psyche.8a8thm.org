[[https://instagram.com/p/BhNZ6w-g4G_/]] People always say Harry should have acted differently because the Dursley's were abusive, but I always thought his actions fit perfectly.


** You really have to think beyond the Dursleys: it's not just about the cupboard and the endless chores and complete lack of affection. As a kid, Harry was forced to go to school wearing terrible, baggy clothes (often shrunken hand-me-downs from Dudley). He was not popular, he had zero friends (I believe befriending him would have caught the ire of Dudley and his gang?), and for the first eleven years of his life, his best recollections are eating crappy choclate cake at Mrs. Figgs. I mean, that's just...miserable. For years.

Such isolation and discontent can really only breed resentment and a host of other negative qualities. Honestly, people criticize the series for plot holes and time paradoxes, but the really unbelievable part is that, given his childhood, Harry grew up to be a decent kid.

Of course, it's something I am more than willing to overlook, because, otherwise, what sort of story would it be?

*** You also have to think beyond the Dursleys to all the adults Harry met as a child.

How many teachers saw that he was wearing broken taped together glasses and old, ill-fitting clothes, while they did nothing to help. How many times did he have to explain away malnourishment and "Harry hunting" bruises to the school nurse. How did not one single adult ever step in and help a clearly neglected child.

  the endless chores
#+end_quote

There's actually evidence in canon that implies that the Dursleys /didn't/ have Harry do endless chores. The big one is the beginning of CoS, in which he is told to stay outside while Petunia cleans. There is no instance of him being told to do gardening, clean the dishes or cook all the food. The closest it comes is him being told to mind the bacon briefly on Dudley's birthday in PS.

**** Cooking and cleaning, no, but he was set to gardening:

#+begin_quote
  While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice-creams, Harry cleaned the windows, washed the car, *mowed the lawn, trimmed the flowerbeds, pruned and watered the roses* and re-painted the garden bench.

  [...]

  “Wish they could see famous Harry Potter now,” he thought savagely, as he *spread manure on the flowerbeds*, his back aching, sweat running down his face.
#+end_quote

Your overall point is true, however. These chores were given as punishment rather than just because (though they're excessive work to be doing in the heat).

*** It's possible that the Horcrux was the reason that resentment didn't fester. Tom Riddle grew up in an Orphanage, aka Hell on Earth. It's possible that Harry subconsciously offloaded that resentment onto the soul fragment, which had that resentment and hate as a baseline already.

**** There's no evidence that the orphanage Tom Riddle grew up in was "hell on earth." Harry almost certainly had the worse adolescence of the two. The fragment of Voldemort only negatively impacts his emotions, it doesn't serve as a, like, reserve for his excess ill feelings.

You are very wrong. Tom Riddle had to live through WW2, with no home (Orphanages were most likely evacuated while he was at Hogwarts), no money, no way to defend himself, bombings, etc. No wonder he grew up to hate muggles.

** Dursley abuse was the literary equivalent of cartoon violence: they are the "evil step-parents", the most boring and mundane of Muggles whose main function is to be a foil for the amazing and wonderful wizarding world.

Deep analysis of how Dursleys had affected his psyche is like looking for symptoms of concussion in Daffy Duck after Bugs Bunny drops an anvil on his head.

** Yeah, I've always felt the Dursleys were a lot more passive and neglectful in their actions towards Harry rather than actively malicious? Like, they'd antagonize him definitely but not like beat him or that stuff - not that verbal abuse isn't as bad as physical, but some fics have him whipped half-to-death daily and I don't really see the Dursleys putting that much effort into it.

******** I don't know what you're smoking but please, don't share it.

I made two factual statements. Petunia tried to hit Harry with a frying pan. That incident occurred on Harry's twelfth birthday. I'm not sure how you get a tacit approval of abuse out of that, just because I didn't feel the need to state the obvious fact that child abuse is bad. Go bother the people who claim it was clearly a joke

*** I don't think it was constant physical abuse, but there's definitely an undertone. Part of it is that PS is a children's book, and what I think is a larger part is that we meet Harry at 11 and only get a couple glimpses at him as a younger boy. Through the early books, Harry certainly seems to fear Vernon in a way that isn't quite explained by verbal abuse only. In addition, we know Dudley and his gang are physically violent towards Harry, and the Dursleys tacitly condone this violence.

** It could have gone both ways. He someone who is an extremely good person. I would also understand completely if he was selfish and cared only about his own survival after the Dursleys. The fact Harry isn't bitter at all to me suggests the abuse at the Dursley's wasn't nearly as bad as fanon makes out. He could so easily have decided that the only person who looks after him is him and therefore he should only look after himself.
