Where a war torn character (can be Harry, Hermione, Severus, or whoever, I'm not picky) gets thrown back into their younger self, except they're Dark (with a reason) and kinda messed up. Especially if they have to try to play the sweet innocent child while trying not to hex the bollox off all the kids they know turn into Death Eaters lol. Must be either complete or still being regularly updated (abandoned fics drive me nuts) and of a decent enough length to keep me entertained for a bit (I average 40k words a day). I'm looking forward to suggestions! Thank you! Here is link (hopefully, I'm a firsty) to Circular Reasoning linkffn(2680093)

**** Valid point but not entirely true. Can't remember the name off the top of my head, but I read a Hermione time travel fic a while ago where severely scarred and PTSD Hermione gets thrown into the Marauder's era. And there've been a few second chance Snape stories that were fairly dark, though most of them tend to just be angsty.

****** Yeah, and CR is kinda in a liege of its' own. The details of the plots, the hidden underbelly of the Wizarding world, all the different creatures... Lol I'm not expecting to find another fic that's at the same level. But anything that involves a young character walking into Knockturn Alley like they own the place is something I'm interested in.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

*** I like that one a lot.

It deals with V and his Death Eaters swiftly and decisively, which things should be in a time travel.

Then the it's followed by a convincing and credible romance with the new Hermione.

***** Why not? I'm on Chapter 11. It's well written, amusing, and different. Most of the fic complaints I've seen comes from port writing and repetitive plots, and this (so far) has neither. You'd think people would appreciate that lol.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny

  Torn from a desolate future, Harry awakens in his teenage body with a hefty debt on his soul. Entangled in his lies and unable to trust even his own fraying sanity, he struggles to stay ahead of his enemies. Desperation is the new anthem of violence.
