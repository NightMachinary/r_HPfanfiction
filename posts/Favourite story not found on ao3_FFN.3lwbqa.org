I rarely go through other sites, simply because the fic base for ao3/FFN is so large. However, I am aware there's a lot of great fics I'm missing because I don't branch out into smaller sites.


** I made a post for [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3an5ot/great_fics_from_hpff_primarily_oneshots_minor/][my favorite completed stories from HPFF]] awhile back.

*** I love Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived, but are all of the Brane stories HP/Hermione related? EDITED for stupid autocorrect.

**** Ah, I realize the set up is a bit confusing - those stories listed first, in the series description are actually side stories from other authors.

The first story of the series is [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=26436]] . It's set in the canon HP world, after the war, but with lots of crossover elements as lots of heroes have to work together to battle a threat to them all.

The next story, Cross Purposes ( [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=27744]] ) is a collection of follow-up stories and arcs, some set in the HP world, some not (but some of those featuring an alternate Hermione). Not too many Harry Potter stories there though.

The third story, ( [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=28614]] ), is set in the Alex Mack verse, but features the adult versions of the trio from "Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived" ( [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=30822]] ) in a number of chapters.

***** Awesome! Thank you so much for that clarification. I really love this author's take on things and writing style, so I'm glad there is more to it!

  With help from friends, Harry realises that being "the Harry Potter" in the Tri-wizard tournament can only be a good thing. That, and learning to be a Blacksmith can't be anything other than cool.

Lavender Brown also struggles to show that she's not just a pretty face- but when Charlie Weasley shows up, will that put a stop to her plans?

** I was a Buffy fanfiction reader to begin with (well, Ranma 1/2 before that, but that's unrelated to this) and I had read the HP books, but didn't really bother with fanfiction, so I have to link the fics that got me into HPFF back in the first place: [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-6136/Tassos+The+Flat+Next+Door.htm][Tassos' The Flat Next Door]] and [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-8175/AnimeRonin+Reincarnation+Can+Suck.htm][AnimeRonin's Reincarnation Can Suck]].

The former has withheld the test of time and change in tastes better than the latter, but both are still on the level I'd consider readable even now, it's just the former would probably be one I'd favorite (or Recommend given the way TtH works) and the latter may not make the cut according to my current standards.
