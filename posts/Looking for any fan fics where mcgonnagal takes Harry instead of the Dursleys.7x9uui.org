  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

** Most such stories that seem like they will involve McGonagall raising Harry are falsely advertised as such (like "Harry McGonagall", he's raised by an OC McGonagall in America until he goes to Hogwarts, which I found super lame a route to take). I've only found a few that actually do so (or come close), such as:

McGonagall's soft side - linkffn(2722845)

Hand Delivered Letter (Note: this is more of a "McGonagall rescues Harry from the Dursleys" premise) - linkffn(7989419)

and

Harry Potter and the Tabby Cat (McGonagall takes Harry in after the zoo incident) - linkffn(12531450)

If I find anymore later, I'll make another post (I think I'm missing one that I started reading but I can't find it right now)~

  What if McGonagall had delivered the letter from the start like she had done for every other muggle-raised child? Why wouldn't she have wanted to check up on Harry when she loathed the Dursley's from day one? Well, maybe Harry would have been encouraged to think and try his hardest not to make friends but to earn the respect of his new guardian. Begins after the trip to the zoo.

#+begin_quote
  Instead of sending his Hogwarts acceptance letter by owl, McGonagall decides to personally deliver to Harry, which sets of a chain of events that changes many aspects of the life of the Boy-Who-Lived.
