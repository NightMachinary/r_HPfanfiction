I would like Fics that contain atleast one sex scene. It doesnt have to be detailed, though. The variety of what the Content should be can vary, but i imagined, that it would be hurt/comfort, so Gabrielle is comforting Harry either for Hurt for the War or other Events.

Other possibilities would be Gabrielle has developed a Crush on Harry and wants to sleep with him. I know there is "Harry Potter and the Veela Sisters", but i would like other possible fictions aswell.

Or maybe Gabrielle fancies Harry, but he see her more like a younger sister (but it doesnt stop them from eventual end in the Bed).

Romance isnt really a thing, that i expect in thouse fics or even between them. Their behaviour for each other is nice and so on and they might share a deeper connection, because they get intim, but anything else besides attraction wouldnt necessary be the case.
