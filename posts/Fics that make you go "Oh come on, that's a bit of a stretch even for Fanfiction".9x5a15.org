Sure, Fanfiction allows you to go to weird and wonderful (Or creepy - Voldemort x Harry shippers.... Harry would never willingly love Voldemort, if you wanted to write that, having Voldemort be some kind of Demented Lunatic, and Mindbreak Torture Harry into Stockholm Syndrome, or the Horcrux possession does something but not "Oh Voldemort looks like Tom again. I'd hit that" level of trash) I can believe Evil Dumbledore (even if people go "Oh he's not Evil, he genuinely believes he's acting for the Greater Good" as many Evil people do) I can believe redeemed Lucius (ACTUALLY being under the Imperius Curse) but what are fics that make you go "Nope. My Suspension of Disbelief doesn't go that far" (Snarry Slash that isn't Snape raping Harry to get back at James. If Harry looked like Lily, or was a girl that looked like Lily, it'd make more sense for what we know of Snape and not make you sigh at bad Yaoi Fangirl writing)


** The first example that popped into my head was from Folie Le Deux, the fic that people claim is one of the more realistic and believable Harry/Hermione affair fics. It started off okay, the character writing was logical enough and reasonably paced. And then chapter 2 rolled around and Hermione walked in on Harry fucking Narcissa while giving dirty talk that was so over the top, it gave me flashbacks to the writing of Cloneserpents.

**** I haven't read Cursed Child and probably never will considering how much it gets panned by people on this sub, so I can't comment on that.

Regarding the Idiot Ball:

It does pop up frequently in canon so that kids can be heroes, as you said. In fanfiction I've seen it in almost every single time travel fic set during Riddle's Hogwarts years. It's the most common reason for me X'ing out of those fics even though I like the premise.

Regarding Deus Ex Machinas:

Technically the Elder Wand wasn't a Deus Ex Machina because a) it didn't pop up out of left field with zero foreshadowing and b) it wasn't used apropos of nothing as the solution to an insurmountable plot obstacle. The Deathly Hallows appeared in the previous books even if we didn't know what they were (a Chekhovs Gun style of foreshadowing common in the books) and Harry was mostly saved by being a Horcrux and having the "mothers love" protection.

In fanfiction it's a Deus Ex Machina if Harry defeats his enemy with an OP spell or ability that he was never shown learning or using previously and/or the convenient solution never makes another appearance in the rest of the fic despite having far reaching implications.

I would not say that it is Deus Ex Machina. It is set up to well and really does not come out of nowhere as much as it had to qualify as being illogical plot hole solution. It helps, that we already kinda know of its mythical proportions due to Dumbledore amassing slightly unexplainable magical feats in the previous books and long beforehand.

No, I'm sure that isn't right. I don't think there's any formal definition of a Deus Ex Machina, but introducing an object and only revealing it's very special properties in the desciding moment in order to save the hero feels very much like a Deus Ex Machina.

  A Deus ex Machina is when some new event, character, ability, or object solves a seemingly unsolvable problem in a sudden, unexpected way. It's often used as the solution to what is called "writing yourself into a corner," where the problem is so extreme that nothing in the established setting suggests that there is a logical way for the characters to escape. If a bomb is about to go off, someone finds a convenient bomb-proof bunker in easy reach. If a protagonist falls off a cliff, a flying robot will suddenly appear to catch them. A Million-to-One Chance of something occurring is accomplished by a bystander who didn't know what they were doing.

What you've described is an example of [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun][Chekhov's Gun]] style forshadowing. Foreshadowing is basically the oposite of Deus Ex Machina.

******* Okay this comment is pretty incomprehensible to me, so I think we have a misunderstanding here.

1.) I don't think the Elder Wand is a Deus Ex Machina

2.) Having appeared earlier or foreshadowing are not qualifiers that make something "not a deus ex machina". If Harry had realized that his Holly Wand shoots a Death Ray when he squeezes it real hard, it would have been a Deus Ex Machina, even if the Holly Wand had been around for the whole series. Similarly it can be argued that the very technical properties of wand ownership, which allowed for Harry's victory, are a Deus Ex Machina.

3.) I know what Chekov's Gun means. It is unrelated to Deus Ex Machina - which was my point. A Chekov's Gun can still be a Deus Ex Machina.

Just look at Draco, he was a blood supremacist and made the eminently clear. So a Legilimency use should show him to be a perfect Death Eater, right? Except when push came to shove he couldn't kill their greatest enemy, even if he had been willing to try indirect methods of murder and an Imperius.

Draco would have seemed a passable Death Eater because of his deep fear of Voldemort that motivated him to follow his orders, but far less useful than a truly loyal one, like he thought Snape was.

The idea that Snape participated in enough Death Eater operations to secure his position in the eyes of his peers was never in question. My argument is that the idea that there's some kind of horrible initiation rite where a prospective Death Eater has to commit some vile and unforgivable act just to prove themselves has no basis in canon. People crucify Snape under the tenuous assumption that he /must/ have raped or tortured /someone/ when he took the mark, when there's no evidence that he ever did anything of the sort. Snape is guilty of plenty of crimes, but people act like taking the mark itself is damning evidence of heinous deeds and should be punishable in itself.

This is just untrue. Whether or not Voldemort personally put much stock in blood supremacy isn't the point, his organization was explicitly structured by and acted in accordance with that belief. Draco had all the history and beliefs that made him the perfect person to put in such a group. And Draco would have loyalty to Voldemort, there's no reason to think he'd deviate from his father's indoctrination (in fact, he outright says this at the end of GoF; the whole "you chose the wrong side Potter" stuff).

I didn't say there was an initiation rite, I quite explicitly said there certainly weren't any standard tests of loyalty, that's fanon. As an example, that (I think) Muggle Studies teacher executed at the dinner table in DH. Anyone not OK with that, not OK with killing whoever Voldemort commands (or whatever he commands in general) don't live long. But terrorist organizations, being inherently ideological in nature, don't promote diversity, so as you say it's just a fact that Snape would have done a bunch of horrible stuff.

I can't see Harry forgetting how Snape abused the Gryffindors for six years, even if he was a spy (which is why the epilouge breaks my suspension of disbelief) and so on. Hell, due to personal experiences I found it completly immersion destroying that the "ten dark years" confession never went anywhere. And admittedly, I have no clue how to resolve that without destroying Rowling's vision, but then perhaps she should have written it differently.

Overall, I have no issues with magic, SciFi tech, aliens and so on. But the characters are supposed to be the one connection to the mundane world, and if they forget war crimes in the blink of an eye or their parent's murder, then that goes too far.

Seriously, I looked through Ao3 the other day and most of the stories with him in the lead completely ignore his canon characterisation (and now I need some +Vodka+ brain bleach to get over the "Slytherin Sex God" cringe)

******* Yeah, the "Sex God" line irks me as well... Of course, people have different tastes... Personally, I absolutely love Malfoy's character, because he is one of the few individuals in the series that can be a given a complex and believable redemption arc.

At its core, Harry Potter is fairly black and white: Good Guy Gryffindors vs. Sleazy Slytherin Snakes with a coming-of-age story wedged in-between. There's nothing wrong with that, I love the books, but by now I kinda wish there was a bit more complexity to the series...which puts me here in fanfiction, heh.

What do you like about Malfoy's character in canon? There isn't much depth beyond being a bigot.

Maybe you are talking about his situation? Being the only son of the Malfoys and basically being pushed into a position of servitude to Voldemort, no matter what you'd want out of life.

These two are very different things and if you think the second one is what makes him interesting, then that's perfectly in line with what [[/u/Hellstrike]] is suggesting by turning him into an OC. When it comes to most Draco centric stories he - as a character - is unrecognizable to the one we see in canon. It's just a different character shoved into Draco's skin and his situation. Kinda a "Draco reboot", but authors who do this rarely seem to be aware that they are doing it.

********* You're right, there's little to like about Malfoy in canon. But I enjoy reading about him in fanfiction, because, as I stated, he's in a unique position for a well-written redemption arc, and there are no other /major/ characters in the series (except maybe Snape, depending on your stance) that can fulfill that role.

Consider his character: a bully, a bigot, and a brat. And yet, he's not totally lost. He has the potential to become good. Fanfiction can explore that. It can present a story where Malfoy slowly starts to doubt his preconceptions and question his morals, placing him in the brutal position between the values of his family and the notions of what is “right”.

Now, such a story would obviously be a divergence to canon, but unless your stance on OC is that all fanfiction characters are OC by default, then I cannot agree that it replaces him with someone else.

Stories change characters, yes, but that's what stories are /supposed/ to do! Is Harry Potter in book 7 an OC, because he's changed and grown and matured from the boy he was in book 1? Of course not! He is still Harry Potter! In the same way, a story that presents Draco Malfoy's realistic change and growth (not just popping it on the reader out of nowhere; in that case, you're right, it is an OC), is still a story about Draco Malfoy!

And it's probably a wonderful story with a great redemption arc, and it is a pity there are so few of them.

Lupin could use one after ditching his wife. Show him as loving, divorced father because they are underrepresented in fiction/media. It would also turn Tonks back to the BAMF she was in OOTP and not the mope-y pushover in HBP and DH.

You could give one to Dumbledore for the whole "ten dark years" thing. Although that one is just barely more believable than the war criminals known as Death Eaters.

My all-time favourite would be Bellatrix Lestrange into salty, ass-kicking anti-hero who culls the Death Eater ranks. And unlike Malfoy (or Snape) she actually served a prison sentence and did not avoid her crimes.

Or actually give one to Ron after the whole Horcurx Hunt. He might never get Hermione, but the world is not over if you don't get the childhood crush with absolutely no common interests. That would also add some depth to his character because now his actions have consequences instead of just getting the cold shoulder for a few days like in GoF and DH.
