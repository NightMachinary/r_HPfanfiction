Hey everyone,

so with mandatory home office comes the boredom and I am looking for new fics to read.

I really enjoy timetravel fics and am looking for new ones. I dont care whether Harry goes back into his old body, or moves through time completly himself and creates chaos that way. I also dont mind slash fics or dark Harry fics or bashing, so just hit me with whatever you got :)

I also like Master of Death fics, so if you have some of those just gimme your reccomendations :D

If its crack thats great, if its not that is also great. I dont care if Harry is light, dark or grey, or maybe just slightly insane (because that is usually hilarious).

Thanks already in advance :)


** linkffn(Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is) is one of the best fics which hit both topics.

linkffn(On a Pale Horse) is a cracky death!Harry fic.

linkffn(I'm Still Here) is technically cross-dimensional, but still great. Updates very infrequently though.

linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar) is one of my favorite MoD fics. LotR crossover, bit one of the few well done examples.

linkffn(11494031) has him linked with Death very early on. Crossover with Sandman, but doesn't really need much knowledge.

linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute) is time travel on a clock. Great sense of urgency.

linkffn(Across the Universe) is one of the best dimensions oneshots.

linkffn(Stages of Hope). A classic, just read it. Excellently crafted.

And finally, linkffn(Dimension Hopping for Beginners), a parody of dimension travel fics..

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

  COMPLETE. In the heat of the battle, he swore a blood oath to defeat Voldemort in every form. But when you factor in his understanding and abilities to travel to alternate dimensions, it presented the sort of problem only a Harry Potter could have.

** *Time Travel*

[[https://www.archiveofourown.org/series/755028][Of a Linear Circle]] should eat up a TON of your time. Updating every Friday, it's at 1.4m words and with 5 chapters left the countdown is ON. I /cannot/ recommend this one enough, it's amazing. Part One: linkao3(11284494)

Gelosaþ in Écnesse - This is the story that prompted me to give slash a chance, and without it I never would've gotten hooked on Linear Circle (the first one on this list) and that would've been a shame. linkao3(2352896)

Time to Spare. The summary is atrocious, but it was rather good. linkffn(2538955)

To Shape and Change - Snape is actually the one to go back in time, but it's still a Harry-centric fic. linkffn(6413108)

Browncoat, Green Eyes - Uh huh, this totally is a time travel fic. Fusion-style crossover with Firefly, a much older Harry gets bored and puts himself asleep for a few hundred years. Knowledge of Firefly would be useful, but you could likely get away with just googling anything you don't understand: he does a decent job of explaining things. linkffn(2857962)

*MoD!Harry*

Warning: these are crossovers.

Illusions of Grandeur - Snarky Harry x Supernatural. Knowledge of the original SPN plotline would be useful (seasons 1-5). linkffn(8957424)

Finding Home - xMCU. I actually read this before I watched a single MCU movie. I don't recommend it - you'll appreciate Stark more if you've watched at least Iron Man lol. Rather liked this, and the sequel getting abandoned made me sad. linkffn(8148717)

Steve and the Barkeep - xMCU. This is a classic for a reason. linkffn(8410168)

A Child Avenged - xMCU. A very fun oneshot. linkffn(11426651)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/209843][MoD!Harry is Not Amused]] - A funny series of oneshots. Crossover mostly with the MCU (uses Thanos' comic book motivations rather than the MCU ones though). Start with Deus Initium linkao3(3784948)

Wizard from Earth - x Man from Earth - I know squat about that movie and I was fine. An abandoned story in the vein of 'A Long Journey Home', but without the fem!Harry. linkffn)8337871)

Of Wizards and Heroes - xMCU. Another amazing slash fic that I would've missed out on if not for Gelosaþ. This one is /very/ good. linkao3(4148136)

The Power He Knows Not - xLoTR - By the author of Shadow of Angmar, I like to rec this one instead since it's cute and complete. linkffn(11027086)

On Punching Gods and Absentee Dads - xMCU. This one is a stretch, I know, and you need to read like, almost everything that's published thus far to see why, but it's really fun. Updates every other week or thereabouts, and is currently past the climax. linkao3(17926664)

A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...

*** Thank you for your recommendations!

I read "Of a linear circle" and am also following it. It is a great fic, highly recommend it as well! I didnt know there were only 5 chapters left??? O.o

I will definitely check the others out! I am not thaaat keen on crossovers but some are great :)

My favourite one with crossovers is [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1456519][Harry Potter, Lone Traveler]], really long and amazing series.

**** The latest update of Circle included a final chapter count! Saw it yesterday and did a little dance tbh.

I really suggest you give Browncoat a try at the very least. I wasn't that big of a fan of Nonjon's other work, but the Firefly fusion one was superb. A crossover that doesn't rehash canon for either fandom, but creates a brand new story that merges the two? Oh yeah.

I liked the Lone Traveller stories as well, and am following the DS9 crossover that Dunuelos is sort-of writing (it's stalled out atm, and hopefully not abandoned). But since you liked that series, definitely give the 'Harry is not amused' oneshot series a look. The second one in particular had me grinning like a loon.

Of the MOD!Crossovers, the best two are likely Illusions of Grandeur and Of Wizards and Heroes - the second one being a pretty popular recommendation here for good reason.

I mean, I liked them all or I wouldn't have suggested them. But, you know. Everyone has their favourites! lol

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  The fiasco at the Department of Mysteries had many consequences. One accident with a time-turner sent Harry to a faraway past. But who can really he rely on in this farce of home? And should he really trust Albus Dumbledore to have his best interests at heart?Harry was going to go back to his time. Back to 1996. He was going to go back to the Department of Mysteries. He was going to save his friends, and everybody in his time whose existence is being threatened.But how? At what price?And what will be left of him in the end?

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

  Grindelwald is rising. Europe is preparing to war. The prohibition is creating new underground's powers. The Great Depression will soon strike in the entire world. The ISS in threatened every day. The MACUSA is panicking. Albus Dumbledore is facing his old demons. Somewhere, the young Mr Riddle is testing his new powers at the orphanage, unknown to the wizarding world. A certain Obscurus is running around to seek safety. His Magicozoologist friend is running around for reasons.And Harry... Harry is trying to avoid the worst.

  Unable to accept the aftermath of the war, Harry decides to travel back in time to become the parent Tom Riddle obviously should have had. Except that things don't go as planned and Harry finds himself part of a game with hidden rules, trying to survive while raising a boy whose understanding of family has nothing to do with love.
