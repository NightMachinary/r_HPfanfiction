They nuked their AO3, FFN and Reddit accounts and they haven't responded to PMs via FFN, so if anyone has a copy of Lavender Brown: Hogwarts Champion Extraordinaire and The Very Reluctant Saviour of the Wizarding World that would be great.


** Sending PM.

I hope Ynmidk is ok. I'd very much like to read the ends of their unfinished stories. I think they're one of the best authors in the fandom.

EDIT: sent to all who requested.

**** I'd also like a copy if possible. I was in the middle of the story when it dissapeared and haven't been able to read the latest three chapters.

Edit: Whoops sorry bout that. PMing.

** I started reading fanfics so long ago, not realizing how ephemeral some of the sites and repositories would be. I wish I'd thought to download my favorites!
