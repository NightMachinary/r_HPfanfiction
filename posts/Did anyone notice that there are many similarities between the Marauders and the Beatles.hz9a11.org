Recently, I've started to get back into my old Beatles groove. They've been my all-time favorite band since I was 8, so I can proudly say that I know a hell of a lot about them and their achievements.

As I was thinking of the group, I realized how well the Marauders fit the personality descriptions of the Beatles.

In the Beatles, the two forerunners of the band were John Lennon and Paul McCartney. They were known as "The Intelligent/Witty One" and "The Cute One," respectively. They wrote most of the songs and composed most of the music. They were also the most extroverted. George Harrison was the lead guitarist and extremely talented, but he was quiet and introverted. He was known as "The Quiet One." Ringo Starr, the drummer of the band, was the one who kept time and also drummed in a way that wasn't known to other musicians before he rose to fame. He was known as "The Funny One." Together, the Beatles created music which shook the world to its very core and revolutionized music as we knew it for the foreseeable future.

As for the Marauders, the four Gryffindors have similar descriptions. James Potter and Sirius Black were the leaders of the group with James and Sirius coming up with most of the pranks and different escapades. They also (regrettably) led the group in its bullying of younger students and Snape. In a sense, James and Sirius could actually be compared interchangeably with John Lennon and Paul McCartney (which is why I placed all four of them in one paragraph). This is because even though Lennon was the founder of the band (making him similar to James), he was very brash and rebellious, similar to how Sirius was. He was especially like Sirius when he made the "more popular than Jesus right now" comment, and him shamelessly advocating for peace and being very outspoken against violence during the Vietnam War made him a big risk-taker and a target. In rebelliousness and brashness, those actions parallel greatly to Sirius's actions (those said actions /did/ lead Sirius to be convinced that he wasn't safe enough as a Secret-Keeper and switched roles with Pettigrew at the last minute because of this). McCartney could be compared to Sirius as well. Similarly to how Sirius was known as the most handsome Marauder, McCartney was known as the most handsome Beatle, but that's where the similarities end. Personality-wise, McCartney was more like James because he was as equally extroverted, but he didn't stir up as much sensational controversy as Lennon did during their time as as bandmates. He was very charming and charismatic and didn't do much to upset them (like Lennon did). Work-wise and contribution-wise, James and Sirius were equals, just as Lennon and McCartney were.

Remus Lupin was the quiet, talented, and unassuming one in the Marauders. He was also the third one to join the group, similarly to how George Harrison was the third Beatle to join the band. Both of them were very talented in their fields, with Lupin earning the highest grades and Harrison being the lead guitarist. Both men were introverted and started shedding their shells a bit once they joined their respective groups. Neither Remus nor Harrison were necessarily leaders, but both of them did make important contributions to the Marauders and the Beatles, respectively. Remus probably made the most important contributions to the Marauder's Map as Harrison made some of the most important contributions to the Beatles' song repertoire and the music played in it. Both of them were also quite humble compared to the other two group members as well, and both of them seemed to have level heads.

The only things Peter Pettigrew and Ringo Starr have in common are their height, the attention they got from others, and their humor status within their respective groups. Both men were shorter than their other three group mates. Being the drummer, Starr was ignored quite a bit compared to the other three Beatles even though he was accepted into the band due to his raw talent with the drum set unlike Peter, who was accepted into the Marauders out of pity. Starr usually made the funny jokes and did the funny stunts which made their fans laugh and was sometimes the butt of them in /The Beatles/ (an American cartoon), /A Hard Day's Night/, and /Help!/. Peter, on the other hand, was the butt of the jokes almost all the time within the Marauders (when they weren't tormenting Snape).

In conclusion, the Marauders are more similar to the Beatles than I ever thought. Wow. (People should really write fanfics about this...)

*What are your thoughts? Let me know in the comments below!*


** Fair comparison but I'm not sure when it's stated that Pettigrew was accepted in the group out of pity or whether he was the butt of the jokes. The only thing that it's mentioned about his relationship with the young James and Sirius was that he always followed them around. Also Pettigrew would have been himself a fairly competent wizard, despite Voldemort's humiliations, since he became an animagus at 15, was able to track down Voldemort (a feat that not even the elite Aurors couldn't achieve) and revive him. Of course, when we see him, he is so broken down by spending years as a rat and another year tormented by Voldemort's verbal, mental and physical abuse, but, despite being an unlikable character, he does have his unique talents.
