Only MAJOR thing is I'd rather not have character bashing. Now a character disliking a character is one thing, but the author purposely bashing the character is a huge no for me.


** Hello,

That Was Part of the Plan by LysandraLeigh + follow on. This has a lot of world building and detail in it -- it is sitting right now at a shade under 670,000 words and only a year has past. such a god story so far; it needs to be talked about more. linkffn(13001792; 13372464; 13439553)

*** Can you tell me more about the story? It sounds interesting, but I am still unsure. Is young Bella as insane as the older one? How is her being in two places at the same time handled? Is there any romance?

**** In this it is written mostly from her perspective so it seems (mostly) reasonable, but she is there to make chaos. The issue of the two Bellas is ongoing, young Bella is incapable of keep to her story; which adds a bit of comedy. Yes there is romance but slow and is still building, it has not had too much of an impact so far but it could or could not.

I cannot truly do it justice (or any literary work) and I would recommend just reading the first couple of chapters, after all if you not like it you can just stop reading. This is one of only a small hand full of FanFics I have read "cover to cover," and that is why I recommend it.

  Thirteen-year-old Bella Black intended to go back in time to start a war in service to her patron goddess. Ritual magic goes awry and she finds herself in 1993, faced with a failing House of Black, an insane alter ego, and a Dark Lord on the rise. Chaos ensues. Title drop. (A collaboration by LeighaGreene and inwardtransience)
