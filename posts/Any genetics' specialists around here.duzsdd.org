I've read many HP fics where the purebloods have rituals they can use to remove one parent from their family tree. Or a Master of Death can do something similar. Like, a half-blood undergoes the ritual and afterwards is a pureblood since they are now "untouched by filth". My question is, what would actually happen to that person, taking into account real genetics, if that ritual actually existed?


** I'm not a genetics specialist, but if you were to remove all the genes from one particular parent, you would, of course, immediately die. None of your cells would be able to replicate or synthesise proteins, because all of your cells would only have 23 chromosomes (though I imagine it's not that simple).

If my secondary school biology knowledge is sufficient, then all of your cells would essentially be like gametes, except for red blood cells, which have no nucleus.

TL;DR you would die.

*** In theory it would probably be easier to slowly add a third persons genes to start to change your cells rather than deletion of other genes. This would still be an incredibly difficult and dangerous long process, but I think it's more likely possible.

In an HP context this could make your blood â€˜cleaner' by adding extra pure blood genes in.

**** I just love the irony that since red blood cells have no nucleus, the blood is the only part of the body that is not 'purified' in that case

*** either die, or be literally forced to be a genetic clone of the parent left (cause magic)

**** Nope, they would immediately die. As they would be half the clone of their parent due to half the DNA of both parents.

If they didn't die and were a guy they would become sterile at best, have severe reproductive disorders at worst.

**** Yeah, I guess that would happen if all of the chromosomes of the other parent were replicated. However, I would again imagine that it is not that simple.

Edit: that was a lie, you'd end up with two sets of all genes from one parent, which would include some of their own recessive alleles. You'd not be an identical copy, you'd have DNA that could have resulted from their parents. You'd still die because your genetic code has changed so much that when you start producing new cells, they are not compatible with the new body, so the immune system attacks them. It's similar to organ donations in that way.

*** In option three you'd still die if your blood type changed to one different from your current one. Because your red blood cells have no nucleus, they don't change at all, but your immune system would start attacking them if it's an incompatible blood type.

** Absolutely not a geneticist, but based on what little I know and the other two replies, if you must force HP blood magic and real-world genetics into the same box, I would think something more like a magical adoption ritual would make more sense.

In effect, using blood magic you replace the 'mud' with the blood of a suitable pureblood, ideally of the proper gender.

So for instance, if Snape wanted to be ritually purified before / while joining the Death Eaters, he could have Abraxas Malfoy's blood used to replace Tobias Snape's, making him effectively the union of Eileen Prince and Abraxas... and therefore Lucius's younger half-brother and Draco's uncle.

If real genetics took effect, he would then slowly start to show Malfoy-esque traits, to whatever extent those are different from what he inherited from his father.

Note that in theory, if this were possibly, it could be done twice to uplift an actual Muggle-Born. Though why anyone would do such a thing, or why a Muggle-Born would want it done, is another matter.

The whole point of the Harry Potter series is that there is no objective measure of superiority that Pureblood wizards hold, and in fact the most powerful actors in the narrative (Voldemort, Dumbledore, Snape and Harry) were all half-bloods.

#+end_quote

Normally, things that attack and erase the nucleic DNA of an organism's cells are considered carcinogenic. Cancer would probably be the main results of any ritual that attempts this.

If there actually were a ritual to do this, it would be up to the author to determine effects. A complete body transformation? A personality transition as well? In the Harry Potter universe, souls are shown to exist after death as well as an afterlife. This would suggest that personality and personhood are not a function of the body, so the person would probably remain the same in terms of personality and personhood. I'm thinking of the pupa stage of a holometabolous insect right now.

** You can't actually remove a parent's genes without horrific consequences. The only thing a ritual like that could possibly achieve is to fool any magical tests that might exist that check for parentage. Although it probably wouldn't fool a muggle DNA test.

** I mean, if we assume their genetic code is rewritten, rather than having parts deleted, they would just be a clone of the remaining parent, right?
