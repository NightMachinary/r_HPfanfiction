:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Trying to find this fic I read a long time ago that was focused on Hermione going to a sci-fi Hogwarts where students entered at a much older age, 16+ I think. Harry's time traveling daughter was a teacher there, and she was dating a space dragon. Fic was as crazy and unique as it sounds, but I can't remember much more about it. The students had spaceships and stuff.


** This sounds like Doghead13.

  Very extreme AU, myriad crossovers, many new characters, very super Super!Harry, majorly altered timeline. Entering Hogwarts, sixteen-year-old Hermione Granger is about to find herself thrown in at the deep end of one helluva mean old galaxy...
