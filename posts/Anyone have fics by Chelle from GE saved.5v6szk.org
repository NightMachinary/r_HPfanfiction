I came across a recommendation on tumblr of a few fics by Chelle, from Granger Enchanted. Seeing as GE is shutdown, I was wondering if anyone had some (or all) of her fics saved, and if said person would be willing to send them to me. TIA!


** I do, but they are filed by title, so if you could give them to me, I'll hunt them up.

  An unexpected connection is found between Hermione and Professor Snape, but that's only the start of her headaches. Being her father's daughter is one thing. Being her mother's daughter is something else entirely.
