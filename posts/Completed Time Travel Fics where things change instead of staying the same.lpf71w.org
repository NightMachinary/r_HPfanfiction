Bonus if Remus, Sirius and Fred don't die. But not mandatory. (Note if they die in the story, don't tell me!).

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/etc

Asexual/Bisexual etc are all fine

Anyone can be the MC/Any Site/Any Length/Old or New

NO Weasley Bashing Where the Weasley's are using Harry for his fame and fortune as I love the family.

It annoys me when there are time travel fics and nothing changes.

Its one of the few time travel fics that doesn't have weasley bashing. I forget all that changes. It only goes through year 5 and the sequel is on Hiatus.
