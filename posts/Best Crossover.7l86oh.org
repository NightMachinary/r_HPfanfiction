#+begin_quote
  Based on The Galactic War challenge by Belgrath on DZ2's forums. During the Battle at the Department of Mysteries, Harry Potter is sent to the Star Wars universe. Arriving two years before Attack of the Clones, this is Harry's story as he grows through the Clone Wars and his return home. An eventual H/Hr, it will develop after harry's return. Not sure which genres to call this one.

** Linkffn(ghosts of the past) is it the sequel to linkffn(child of the storms) and just updated today. It's mostly a crossover with the Marvel Cinematic Universe but the DC Trinity, the X-Men, Harry Dresden from The Dresden Files, Doctor Strange, and a whole bunch of other people are in this crossover as well.

Hands down one of my favorite crossovers.

#+begin_quote
  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.

  Sequel to Child of the Storm. Harry's life has changed a lot over the past year, what with the return of his father, Thor, murder attempts by everything from HYDRA assassins to Elder Gods keeping him on his toes and making a few new friends. But while Chthon and HYDRA are gone, all sorts of dark things have been stirred up, things thought long gone. And guess who they're after...

** I'm actually not sure how many times I shared this, but I really do love this crossover so I'll basically quote myself now.

“It's a crossover [with] Captain America the First Avenger and it takes places during World War 2 or known in the Wizarding World, the Rise of Grindelwald. Not to mention, from Tom Riddle Jr's point of view (I hope that doesn't derail you from considering to read the story). It's an interesting plot and very well develop since it goes deeper Tom's character growth as well involves more a WW2 style of war. I highly recommend you read it anyways.”

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12490736/1/Come-Together][Come Together]] by oniforever)

The next one is unique considering it's a fic where the main characters are Ron and Clint. I loved how the author made the story original since it involves two of the most underdog characters ever.

Also, here's the sequel:

  EDIT:

  Also, there's this other fic where it made Luna Lovegood so Luna and (pardon my language) badass that I absolutely adore the series.

  It's the Under the Moon series by MerciaLachesis or on AO3 Mercia. I'll give you the link to both sites.
