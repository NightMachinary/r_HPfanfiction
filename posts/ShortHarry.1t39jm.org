** Many of the abused|Harry fics mention him being short for his age, due to malnutrition with the Dursleys or whatever. I can't think of any off the top of my head where this is a major plot point, beyond underlining the abuse.

** Canon!Harry is presumed to be nearly average height as of OotP.

Though I wish you luck in your fic search!

** Not a fic, but if you've read the Ender's Game, you can try reading Ender's Shadow.

** Harry isn't short, though. He's just a bit shorter than Ron, but Ron is also /very/ tall. He began as small and scrawny for his age because of malnutrition, but after getting to Hogwarts and the Weasleys he started growing several inches every year. He was the same height as James, who was always described as tall.

I think the films have affected how people see the characters. Radcliffe is certainly short, but Harry wasn't.

*** It's been a while, is Ron actually /described/ as very tall? Or just that he had a growth spurt and was taller than Harry?

Also, tall in the UK is different than tall in the US

**** Tall in the UK and the US is roughly the same; average is both 5'9 to 5'10 for men according to wikipedia.

And yep, Ron is supposed to be very tall and lanky. He's often compared to Fred and George, who are shorter and stockier, but again, the films have made lots of fans imagine them as tall and slim as well.

Just a warning, never take the HP Wiki's information as canon. They base a lot of their information on the films and video games, rather than the books, and so a lot of the information is very inaccurate; I just checked and they say Ron's height is 5'9, which is, go figure, Rupert Grint's height. The HP Lexicon uses only the books and describes Ron as:

  "He was tall, thin and gangling" and "long and lanky"
