:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
the only thing I remember from this fic is that during COS they know immediately someone is impersonating Crabe/Goyle because Ron under polyjuice calls Hermione a mudblood. It was kind of a record scratch scene. Professor Snape gets called for and it's said that whoever is impersonating them couldn't be a Slytherin because none of them would have called her that in the common room (I think this reasoning had to do with Slytherin taking the "your house is your family" thing very seriously and not wanting her to feel threatened).

â€‹

Does anyone have any ideas of what fic this came from? I've been combing my favorites but I haven't come across it yet. Thanks!


** Are you certain it was Ron and not Connor/whatever name they gave to WBHL Harry? I remember a fic like that.

Sounds like Ron bashing either way, I have a folder somewhere on my desktop with all the bashing fics outlined with reasons when they started bashing so if you give me some more detail (and assuming that was the first instance of Ron Bashing in that fic, I don't generally keep reading after) I might be able to help.

*** I don't tend to read wbhl fics so it's probably not. But I can't be positive. I do read Ron bashing though so it's entirely possibly this fic was doing that but unfortunately I can't remember a lot more. I'm not even sure if Harry was in slytherin with her or not. I'm pretty sure it was Ron though I don't think mudblood was something ron would have called her regularly in the fic he just thought he was being in character but he was probably mouthing off about Slytherins and know-it-all's.
