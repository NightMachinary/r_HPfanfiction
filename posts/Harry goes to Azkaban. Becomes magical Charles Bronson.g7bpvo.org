I'm posting this before I have a chance to come to my senses. Basically, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bronson_(prisoner][<<title>>]])

At any point in his life, up to and including Voldemort's second fall, Harry Potter gets sent to Azkaban. Harried by dementors and surrounded by enemies, he starts becoming violent and erratic. A genuine menace to society.

What happens next is up to you. Maybe they need him for "one last job"; Maybe he decides to escape; Maybe he's gone so far 'round the bend he refuses to leave; The point is to inflict him upon guards, beasts, inmates and magical life at large.

Obviously a crack fic, I'd prefer it to be humorous.

If it helps, the idea came to me after seeing a clip of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paa9knyJKrs][*/Bronson/* starring Tom Hardy]].


** Oh, the prisoner. I looked at the title and thought "Did they mean the inmate or the actor?!"

*** Yeah, I figured that might cause confusion, so I put some links to elaborate. Though there's a thought - "Harry goes to Azkaban and becomes a Charles Bronson character." ...Wait, I think that's too close to the usual plot for a proper crack fic.
