  Harry has reached a very bitter and jaded thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the corruption or pure-blood bigotry one bit. That's when he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of before; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear the system down and salt the earth. And with a double Lordship, he just might have the power to do that.

This sort of fits your request. Harry is very powerful and gets into some politicking. He doesn't go around abusing his power but he shows it off a few times.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

*** A marauders plan always scares me because of the word count. I don't like slow going fics and I feel like it would take 100k words until Harry goes to hogwarts. Is it like that?

**** It starts after 3rd year but it takes 39 chapters, divided into 6 arcs before the school year starts. So it does have a slow build up that includes healing, political alliances and education before heading back to Hogwarts.
