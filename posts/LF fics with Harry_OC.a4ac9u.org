  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

*** I actually think that the summary lets it down. It gives the impression of being, shall we say, over-dramatic? And being fan fiction, over dramatic can be /very/ over dramatic. Seeing that put me off reading it until enough people recommended it that I gave it a try. Once I did, it was quite good.

Just knowing up front that Harry is a widower would have been a big help.

** I really like HP/OC, personally. So I'll toss you my favorites, and some extras I can think of. This is probably gonna be a lot of text, sorry.

Grow Young With Me has already been recommended, but I can't talk about HP/OC fics without mentioning it, at least.

Something in a similar vein is linkffn(Madley In Love) which is like.. /technically/ not HP/OC, but Laura Madley is one of those characters that's canon, and only mentioned a single time. Except there's not the fanon buildup of tropes that's happened with the others- like Tracey Davis, and Daphne Greengrass.

Those fics are both really romance focused. Purely character interaction.

If you want something more action/adventure focused linkffn(Eclipse Of The Sky) is damned nearly non-stop tension. My favorite way to describe it is 'a goddamned masterpiece'. It's really excellently written, it has some neat twists, and is really just a great read if you can handle the sheer amount of tension.

Those are my favorites, but there's a few more good HP/OC fics I can suggest.

There's also The Dark Lord's Pawn. linkffn(12856879) Pretty good read, I've not finished it, though. It was a bit earlier along when I last read it, and I've just not caught up yet. More along the lines of Eclipse than Grow Young With Me.

linkffn(You and I, by emilyherself) was, iirc, not nearly as well written as anything else I've mentioned so far, but a decent enough read on it's own. Definitely more of a relationship driven fic, not much action.

At this point I've gotten out my app and started scrolling through fics I've read previously- everything before this was from memory.

linkffn(Lost Connections, by AsphodelRose87) was pretty good, too.

linkffn(Blood Of The Phoenix, by midnightjen) is a good read. Quite long. Some neat ideas. However, I've not read the sequel.

There's also linkffn(Unknowns, Part The Second). I didn't finish it- fucked with me a bit too much emotionally. You'd probably need to read the prequel, though. 110k words of Sirius/OC. That said, I really enjoyed Unknowns. Much more than the sequel, anyways.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Elemental's Power) is hella long at 403k words, and.. I dunno, it wasn't incredible. I can't remember what my issues were with the fic, really, I just remember that I had some. Was an alright read, though not very romance focused.

linkffn(Valeriana Natassa) was good! I like HP/Vampire fics, not sure why, but this is pretty much the best one I've read. I feel like the author has some weeb tendencies that show in the fic, and the pacing can be a little odd at times. Along with Harry being pretty weak compared to everything around him, which might bother some people. Overall, I liked it.

linkffn(Black Bond, by Rajatarangini) gives me some /seriously/ mixed feelings. This fic has one of my favorite characterizations of Sirius I've ever read. It's fantastically written, too, though a bit long winded sometimes. Overall, it's a really good fic. I also really like Acquila, except for when I want to fucking suffocate her. My main issue is that, and the fact that it's sort of unfinished. Technically, Black Bond is complete. The sequel is not complete, though. And afaik, it's not shown any signs of life recently. Oh! I forgot to mention- it's 1.2m words, so have at that.

Aaaand the last thing I'll mention: linkffn(Runaways, by Scriblerian). I have nothing to say about this fic, mostly because I barely remember it in any way. I vaguely remember enjoying it, and according my app I've finished it. So it can't be all bad.

So that's a lot of suggestions. Hm. I read a shitload of HP/OC I'm beginning to realize. Ah, well. ffnbot!slim
