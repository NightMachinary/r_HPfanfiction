Just like the title says- goblins can either infect others with this energy, have goblin energy themselves, or both. They can infect wizards or they can't, that's up to you. I just want a fic that has the goblins spreading goblin energy. As crack-ish as possible. (Bonus points if goblins capitalized on social media to make it spread to Muggles faster)
