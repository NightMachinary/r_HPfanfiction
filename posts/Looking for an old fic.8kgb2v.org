I'm trying to remember a fic on ff.net, in which harry, never being told the limitations of magic, does all sorts of 'impossible' things, living in a tree that he infused with magic, doing it wandlessly I remember a scene in which McG meets him for the first time, asks how he gets his food and harry conjures a pie Sorry for grammar, typed on phone

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

** I very vaguely remember reading something like this with the tree scene. Like, 7 years ago vague. Maybe I can give some details from the fic I read, it might spark a memory. The one one I remember had harry, pre hogwarts, still living with the dursleys, somehow discover that he has a power he can control, his magic. This might be due to him using accidental magic to run away from dudley and Co. He somehow becomes friends with hermione, because they live closer to each other than in Canon. I don't recall if they meet through school or whatever, I just know they do. Harry teaches her the magic he knows. Harry maybe finds out about the rest of the magical world somehow, because I think he somehow manages to obtain some magical textbooks, but I could be wrong. I remember Harry and Hermione's hangout/learning spot being in a tree. I remember the fact that harry discovering his magic like voldemort did before hogwarts causes one of the adults some kind of concern. And lastly, it was almost certainly going to become a harmony fic, what with hermione being such a big presence before harry even goes to hogwarts.

Hope I helped somehow.

You're welcome. :)

It's actually really funny, while looking for this fic, I came across 2 other old fics I had spent /years/ searching for by complete accident. Or sheer dumb luck, I should say.

**** Close, but I don't think this is the one OP is thinking of. If it's the one I'm thinking of, I'm picturing Hermione and Susan talking about how Harry's seems to be able to do magic that way beyond his level and they figure out it's just because he doesn't know it's supposed to be impossible. They eventually make up a fake spell, with an incantation and wand movement and whatever else and ask him to perform the spell and it works for him. They make a promise to never tell him what he can do, and they actively work to make sure people don't tell him what's "impossible".

And I can't fucking find it!

***** Fair enough, I don't know what OP is looking for 100%.

However.

/"...harry, never being told the limitations of magic, does all sorts of 'impossible' things..."/ Is one of the qualities of the fic OP describes.

The summary of the fic I linked has this /"Without anyone teaching him, he does not know what should be impossible. He breaks the rules of magic..."/

OP also mentions /"...living in a tree that he infused with magic, doing it wandlessly..."/

A section from chapter three, /"His tree became more of a home than Privet Drive ever was. He had made a sort of treehouse about halfway up. Unlike most treehouses, his was made from the tree itself. The tree now had a table and a chair growing directly out of the trunk and branches. He was the only person in the world that had a living treehouse."/ Harry does all of this wandlessly. He also later learns to open a portal inside said tree.

And lastly, OP said, /"...I remember a scene in which McG meets him for the first time, asks how he gets his food and harry conjures a pie..."/

Here is an excerpt of chapter 7 of the story I linked, where Harry meets Mcgonagall for the first time:

/'McGonagall had no idea what to say, so she acted like she was answering a question in a class. "Conjuring food is impossible; it goes against Gamp's law of elemental transfiguration. I've never met a dryad; not many people have. Very little is known about them. You seem like you're both smart, so I don't know why people would say that. And how would you know about what girls think, Mr. Potter? You shouldn't be reading other people's diaries. And Ms. Potter, of course he thinks about food all the time. He's a ten-year-old boy, and they always go through a growth spurt around that age."/

/"But I can conjure food," Harry said, and flicked his wrist to conjure an apple./

/"You have control over your magic!?" she said, shocked again. Albus said that Harry was figuring things out, but she thought he was just doing tricks like Lily had when she was Harry's age. Then, what he just did caught up with her. "You can conjure food! Did you just summon that from another room?"/

/"No, I conjured it. That's how I can live by myself," he said, confused. Was he the only one in the world that could do that?/

/"Mr. Potter, would you please conjure a quiche Lorraine for me?" she asked, astonished at Harry's abilities. She watched him look into Hermione's eyes for a moment, and he conjured a quiche Lorraine./

/"I've never had that before, so I might not have gotten the taste quite right," he defended. McGonagall took out her wand, conjured a fork, and sampled a bite. It was a bit salty, but he had just broken a fundamental law of magic and made a food that he had never eaten before look and taste almost exactly like it should.'/

So I have a strong feeling that this fic is the one OP talks about.

I do empathize with you about not being able to find your fic. That is one of the most frustrating parts about fanfic. Maybe try making a new post for your fic?

***** That sounds like one of Bobmin's fics, especially the made-up spell part.

#+begin_quote
  "Miss Granger came to me the other day with an observation about Mr. Potter. At first, I was skeptical, but I agreed it was worth trying to test out her observation. In class, I had Harry cast the "Comburo Fonticulis" spell. I explained to him what the spell would do and he managed to perform it flawlessly."

  "Professor I must have spent too much time making potions. I don't recall a Comburo Fonticulis spell."

  "That's because it doesn't exist Severus! It's Latin for burning fountain; we made up a spell and told Mr. Potter about it, and he was able to cast it. Miss Granger believes that, so long as no one tells him something is impossible, he'll find a way to do it."

***** Happy to help! I've been helped on this sub with finding a fic I'd been looking for for 6 years, so I've gotta give back to others. It does suck though I find out it's actually hgl, a pairing I love, and not harmony, one I can't stand, only to find out that it is abandoned before the pairing can even meet.
