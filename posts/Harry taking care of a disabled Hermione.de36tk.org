So, I am pretty sure the story was hosted on portkey.org. What I remember is this:

It is post-war and starts with Harry picking up Hermione at St. Mungos where she stayed to recover from some kind of accident or attack. She is paralyzed, no sure if that is temporary or not. At first she stubbornly resists Harry trying to help her, insisting that she can handle everything herself.

That is about all I remember, the story continues and I think it was a very sweet romance overall. I for some reason just thought about the story for the first time in maybe 10 years yesterday and simply can't remember the name.

I know it will be a long shot to find it again with portkey only being partly backed up after they shut down, so any stories that are similar to what I described are very welcome too!

*/EDIT: First: solved! And second: I don't post too much on this sub, can someone explain to me why this thread was downvoted so much? Was something wrong with the way I posted?/*

**** Thanks! Well known author back then in the early 2000's too, "The Power he Knows" not and its sequel "Triumvirate of Resolve" are ringing a bell too.
