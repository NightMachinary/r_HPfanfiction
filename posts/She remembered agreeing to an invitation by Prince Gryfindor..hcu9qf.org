But how she got here Daphne did not remember, snake decour and standing water made her think of Chamber of Secrets. But that wasn't what grabed her attention.

There was a dead Basilisk in the middle of an opera. And on this giants head, likened into a throne, Harry Potter sat, with an open blazier, wild hair, emerald eyes and red tie askew. He didn't even glance at her, his attention was fixed on tied up Draco.

Daphne couldn't help but be shoked as he trew his head back and let out a bellowing laugh. Quick to start, quick to end. He turned his head:

"So you are Slytherin. I guess I don't need to make obvious statements." Harry said and only now she had enought sense to look around and see a lot of her green tied cohort.

"This is a warning, the only one you'll get. The supposed hier Slyherin didn't give one to anyone. So listen closely and especialy you cousin Draco."

Harry took a sword, that was laid by his left, and brandished it out of it's scabart. 'Gryfindor' was clearly engraved on it.

"I am Prince Gryfindor, as you fools enjoyed calling me. Derision or not. Ha, so now you'll refer to me as thus." His green eyes looked everyone else in the eyes.

"So stay neutral or leave, because I am no Dumbledore. I don't have an overwhelming might, that would let me spare you. I don't have deep political ties, that would let me ignore you. I don't have knowledge of an acient lore, that would let me heal you. So know that this is the only warning I will give. I am a fighter tho." He said as he gestured down.

Harry slowly traced the blade down Draco's face and cut him loose. As Draco got up Harry leaned in and whispered something into his ear. Draco looked like death warmed up.

And then she was back in castle. Not knowing what was more terrifying. Potter's declaration of war or that she somehow got in and out mysterious chamber whitout memory of entering or exiting.

Her wet footsteps on stones weren't the only one's that clacked toward dungeons that night.
