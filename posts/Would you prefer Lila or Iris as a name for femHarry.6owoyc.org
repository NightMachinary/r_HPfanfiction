** Anything that isn't a female version of Harry.

I'd prefer something akin to Iris, or Rose. Perhaps a continuation of the flower theme when it comes to many female HP characters.

**** Harriet drives me absolutely insane. Not only is it one of the most abhorrent names known to man, it doesn't suit Harry(or fem Harry) at all.
