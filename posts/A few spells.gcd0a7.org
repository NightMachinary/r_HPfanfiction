Hello!

As we are all spending more time inside, I have been watching the HP movies all over again.

I was inspired and came up with some spells. I thought I'd share :)

*The Fear Curse*

/Palam Timore/

This curse causes the victim to see their worst fear in their minds.

*Witch Sight Charm*

/Experio/

This charm causes the tip of the wand to glow. The caster can look into this light and see/hear up to 2 kilometers away. The caster needs to know the general location. While this happening, the caster is unaware of their surroundings. The longer the caster uses this charm, the more exhausted they become.

*Bridge Conjuration*

/Erigapon/

This spell conjures a bridge. Other casters can contribute with the casting to help create a more advanced, longer, and more durable bridge.

*The Cup Charm*

/Poculum/

This charm conjures a cup. One can also use /Poculum Rafinita/ to conjure a whole drinking set.

*Lightning Bolt*

/Tronderbam/

Shoots lightning. Pretty self-explanatory.

*Long-Lasting Levitation Charm*

/Levios Costam/

It causes a small object to float, more or less, indefinitely. Any disturbance to the object will cause the charm to end. Very basic and simple

*Carving Charm*

/Sculpio/

This charm causes a small lighting bead shoot from the wand onto a hard service. The bead will then magically carve a design within basic substances (wood, stone, etc.) The caster must have the image in mind. Any disturbance to their concentration will cause the spell to end but the carving (however far) will remain.

Happy Saturday :)


** I think there're already a lot of fics with a lightning spell, usually based on fulmine, which means "to thunder". Other than that, kudos bro!

*** I personally like the idea of greek/norse based incantations for lightning spells, as those areas had major gods with that aspect.

*** Yeah, I have seen those. I wanted to create some spells outside of the Latin-based world. I might be working on a fic involving Scandinavia.

** OH, I really like the balance of these spells. They seem all realistic enough to be thought of by J.K. Rowling (meaning I could definitely see them in the books or movies.)

I would see the fear curse being based on boggarts, taught by Lupin in the third year. But there is some form of counterspell missing. Really seems like Dark Arts more than anything. But then again, it is a curse after all.

And the Lightning Bolt one: Would that be summoning a bolt of actual, physical lightning, or would it be like the sensation of a lighting hitting something or someone? This would probably be a spell heavily influenced by intent.

*** JKR wasn't concerned with balance. Accio worked through walls over a kilometer and Molly could use it to summon things she wasn't sure were even there. Transfiguration is permanent. Doubling charm worked on food/money/fuel with no apparent drawback.

** There are a lot of creative spells to be found here. Wouldn't surprise me if they were found in Miranda Goshawk's /Book of Spells./ Though the extension off "/Rafinita/" seems slightly strange to me.

*** One teacup is good for me. But a whole tea set is good for a party!

"Rafinita" is from Esperanto, meaning "refined".

** I am trying to research some Welsh, Sumerian, and Sanscrit to make some exotic spells, also shamelessly getting incantations from Merlin.

Though I haven't found a good source for Ancient Egyptian spells.

Because we know there were Wizards before Latin was invented/spread, so they probably used their own language for their spells.

*** I am all about non-Latin based spells! Until JKR provides canonical spell creation, I am all for creating quasi-conlags for them.

** I would like to share one of my favorite original spells.\\
It's the favorite Curse of my OC Isaac Grimblood, he's a sadistic Ravenclaw that likes to experiment on people he has affinity for Lightning magic and has a freaky obsession with Death and Necromancy, in my fic he's Harry's best friend and the heir to Ravenclaw.

Scalpere, the ripping curse. - Isaac's original and signature curse, it's a cutting curse that fires from the wand a bright purple scythe like blade of light that can tore other beings apart depending on the force behind the spell.\\
It's also pretty versatile, because the half moon blade will be fired accordind to the moviment made with the wand, can be horizontal, vertical, or even a 360 degree rotation that would fire to all sides, this curse also have a penetration effect, after striking a shield charm, the blade of light will shatter and some of the shards can pass trough the shield, causing minor damage to the opponent.
