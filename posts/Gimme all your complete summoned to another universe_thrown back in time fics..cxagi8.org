Turn by Saras_Girl is a sweet story with a well-built other dimension. It is character-driven: while there is a little conflict, it's mostly about relationships and feelings.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

Otherwise, yes the OP did ask for completed stories, but here's a question, what does it hurt to ask if he'd mind decent incomplete stories? It doesn't. I've asked for Harry summoned by the GOF stories, but if someone asked me for a story that starts from GOF with a different Harry to canon in someway, I honestly wouldn't mind if it's interesting enough. I don't look at titles as iron clad rules, but more as guidelines. As in as long as it's in the ball park, and is interesting enough, it doesn't hurt anyone to ask.

***************** But OP said that to you in what I assume was a dm, not in this thread where anyone could read it. Before you told me about it, I had no idea that's what OP wanted so I had to go with what they posted publicly and that was completed stories. Yes I could have dm'ed them as you did but I didn't feel the need to ask a question that I already knew the answer to. "Are incomplete stores okay with you?" This answer was apparently yes but with the information I had available to me, the answer was no.

I mean honestly why ask for complete stories if you don't want complete series? If OP didn't care then don't mention completion status at all. That is what the vast majority of people do on this subreddit when they are requesting stories. They post either what they're looking for, what they're not looking for, or both and we do our best to recommend stories that meets that criteria. If they have four or five different things they want and I've got a story that meets three out of four of them I'd probably say something like "this doesn't mean all of your criteria but it does meet most of it...".

OP wanted two things. They wanted completed stories and summoned to another universe/time travel. If you give him just one of the two then you only did 50% of the request and in any test you take, 50% right is an automatic fail.
