I read this Fanfic as I started to read Harry x Fleur and the only thing I can remember is a scene where Harry was hurt and in the hospital wing with many of Hogwarts students surrounding him. As they are worrying over Harry (who is I think unconscious) Fleur tries to see him but is stopped by the others (for some reason I can't remember).

I know this is super vague but if someone knows anything like it I would like to know.


** A bit slim to really find something. Tough with only that I would bet on either linkffn(Euphoria) chapter 22 or linkffn(Deprived) chapter 17.

Can I just say that this summary is a bright beacon in a sea of darkness. I'm going to read the story just because of this sentence.
