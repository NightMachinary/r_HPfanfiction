:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember that Dumbledore died instead of Lily and James Potter the Halloween that Voldemort attacked. Then if I remember correctly Umbridge gains a position of power within the ministry, even if she didn't though I remember the ministry became more prejudiced.

James and Lily end up buying an island (it was actually either a pair or a trio of islands) which has a castle on it that is a good replica of Hogwarts.

They end up building a community on the island with refugees from an increasingly dark and prejudiced mainland Britain. I can't remember the title or how it ends.

Does anyone know which fic I'm talking about?
