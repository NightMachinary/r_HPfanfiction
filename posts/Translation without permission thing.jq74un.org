I found a rly good French fic, and although she'd already left this fandom, I sent a PM to her and sent a tumblr message. She didn't reply, so I dunno if she's yes or no. In this case posting translation even on my own blog isn't permitted at all?


** Well that depends some folks would say that since you never got her express permission then you shouldn't do it. I can completely understand that position.

I assume you tried a couple of times to contact her over a decent length of time (a couple of weeks) eg two messages in the past two days wouldn't count as sufficient notice IMO.

If you really think her story is so good that it deserves to get a bigger audience by being translated you could still do it but you need to give proper attribution. Eg make sure that you reference her original story, author's name, and link to the original story. As well as describing what you did in trying to get her permission to translate it. Then you should send another note to the author that details all the above and includes a link to your translation.

It's really up to you to decide whether translating someone's story without permission (due to no response) is something you need to do. If you do so you need to make it clear who's story it is.

*** Yeah it's been months and i'm confused if she doesn't care about her previous works anymore and not check her emails, or she refused to reply as a way of saying no... I'd make sure to make a clear reference of her original story. Thanks for your advice!

** I'd think it should be fine. After all, you made every effort to contact the Author and you do not plan to claim it as your own work. In this case, you can assume permission until such time the Author contacts you to take it down - unlikely if they have abandoned the fandom.

I am assuming it's similar situation to compilation/news videos on YouTube - you make no profit, you do not assume ownership, you fit in the news/education/parody niche? It's allright, so long as you leave a means to contact you and you take down your work if prompted.

All in all, you're just doing a fair bit of volunteer work for them and helping advertise their work - it's hard to get mad over that, especially if it's fanfiction and thus ineligible for issues that can happen with international exports.

Things you should do:

- Link the original work and Author (or provide the Title, Pename and Site) in the disclaimer
- Write an acknowledgment (This was originally written by XYZ, this is just a fan translation)
- Enable PM on site you are using or create a dummy email to use for this purpose. Place the contact information in disclaimer and your bio both. (If the Author doesn't want this, they can contact me here)
- Remember to include original disclaimers (Rowling, etc.)
- Send another message to the author, link your traslation

** Translation is an interesting one. Unlike continuing someone else's story, translation doesn't really attempt to displace the original, so it doesn't have the same problems that appear in caes of continuing fics without permission.

However, it does come with its own problem. As an author, I'd be worried about the translation being sub-par, with the result that people reading the fic in that language reached conclusions about the quality of the fic which were not accurate.

Ultimately, as with all things fanfic, I think erring on the side of permission is probably the best route. If you're looking to practice your translation skills there are plenty of fish in the sea.
