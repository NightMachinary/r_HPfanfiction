** Well now, I'm not really one of the 'big' authors, but I do have a couple of reasonably popular stories on my books.

The original questions are a bit vague, and so it's hard to nail down a good answer.

For information, I am [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Esteelbadger][Steelbadger]] on FFN, and I have five stories with more than 1000 follows/favourites, though only one with more than 1000 reviews. I only started in fanfiction a little over two years ago, so compared to the old guard I am very much the newbie. I got into writing fanfiction while completing my final year at Uni, and my first completed story was written as a way of procrastinating on my dissertation. I write mostly because I'm not a natural writer (my profession is as a programmer), and because bettering one of my lesser used skills is, simply, enjoyable.

Mostly, it's been a good experience. A great many of the reviews I have received have been valuable to me, and I take real pleasure in seeing a big review go up for a new chapter. Initially, I would reply to every one of the reviews with thanks and discussion on the topics of the review. As the review numbers grew, however, I found I couldn't. Now I barely respond to any. It's a pity, but I simply don't have the time to write a few hundred words to every one of a hundred different reviewers. I imagine they'd rather that time was dedicated to writing a new chapter.

There has been some strange stuff too, though. Like the people who /hate/ a character with such venom that even mentioning them in passing will lead to some form of vitriol. In the HP/Tomb Raider crossover, most of the background is canon, and so a thought here or there strays to Ron or Hermione. After the first instance of a mention of Ron, I received a message explaining, in great detail, and at great length, that the story was now garbage because of it. Ron was, apparently, 'human excrement' and served only to hold Harry back in canon.

I tried to suggest that 1. It was irrelevant to the actual ongoing story and 2. Ron's not the anti-christ but I just got another angry message basically telling me that I was free to write whatever garbage I wanted, but that they wouldn't be reading it. That story is probably the most frequently panned of my stories, and for good reason, but that particular complaint is pretty funny, looking back. At the time, of course, I was a little annoyed and disheartened.

Another similar review came on my first HP/LotR crossover, where the reviewer said something along the lines of 'Ã‰owyn is a despicable human being, and the thought of her kissing Harry makes me want to vomit'. That one just amused me.

I've had a few people suggest I try my hand at original fiction (with the condition that I inform them when I do). I still feel like I have much to improve upon until I reach that point, if I ever will. But it's nice to hear. Others have suggested I set up a Patreon, but I feel like that is a bit inethical when writing fanfiction, so I discarded the idea out of hand. That said, I don't think there is higher praise an author can get from a reader on the internet than 'I would pay to read your stuff.'

Possibly the /worst/ part of it is when aspiring writers come to me with their ideas or concepts. I feel like a complete phony when that happens. I send them off with meaningless platitudes because I usually know very little about their chosen fandom, and don't have the time to be a beta reader for them. I feel like I should try to do better, be more community spirited, but I have an old and crusty soul, and I really can't be bothered. And that makes me feel bad.

To answer [[/u/booksandpots]] questions:

- I don't really write for the recognition. It's nice to get, but it's not why I write. For that reason, I don't really feel pressured to write for that reason. I do still feel a pressure to write, and to not let my main story die, but that is purely driven by me.

- Not really, as I said above. The biggest weight upon me is simply trying to justify spending 10 or more hours a week on /fanfiction/ of all things, when I have a job, friends and a girlfriend. While I enjoy writing, and I enjoy the sense of achievement, I can't help but feel sometimes that it's an empty achievement. That's a strange sentiment, now that I think about it, as aren't all hobbies ultimately empty achievements? No matter, I enjoy it, and for as long as I can enjoy it, I will.

- That's an interesting question. I would hope, should such an unlikely thing ever come about, that my fanfiction would not change. It would still serve the same escapist purpose it serves now. I would like to be able to wear it as a badge of honour, in the hope that I could raise its standing a little from being seen as the dregs of the literary pool. If wishes was fishes.

Anyway, I've droned on far too long, and I doubt anyone is much interested. I'll answer any other questions people have, though.

** I don't really consider myself popular, but I do have over a 1000 reviews and a decent amount of followers.

It is an added pressure. I started writing fanfic so I could become a good writer and eventually write my own books, but now with so many people reading ( I never thought this many people would really like my story) I do get really nervous. Like my next chapter is a violent scene and I haven't written many of those. I started this to improve, but now people are reading and there is expectations so I can't just post a violent scene and have it be crap. But I haven't written enough of them for it to be that good, so my readers end up waiting longer while I revise and throw out. And they review and message me asking me to post, or asking me when the next chapter is and I feel awful cause it's been a while, but I don't want to post a horrible chapter and disappoint them after all this waiting.

Then I feel silly for taking it so seriously and for sitting in a coffee shop for hours stressing over a single paragraph. I have a lot on my plate: a husband in Medical school, two jobs (one of which is very demanding), friends to keep up with and my husband and I are planning on trying for a baby next year. It's also stressful because I take writing seriously and really want to improve, but it's good stress. I love writing, it's my passion. I've also been very fortunate with my readers, all have been very supportive and kind. I get criticism, of course, but nothing ever just mean. And I'm happy and fortunate to say that I get more good reviews than bad. I actually ended up bumping into a reader. She was a friend of a co worker of mine. That was wild. I never expected to actually meet someone who read my stuff that I didn't know. Let alone meet someone who really liked my stuff.

If I ever made it with my own work ( which is the dream) I don't think I could just take down my fanfic. It would rip my heart out. It's been years of working on it and it's still after over 80 chapters not done. I can't imagine deleting something I worked for years on and loved so much.

** My most popular story is also my worst story. So I still get all sorts of asinine questions or comments relating to it and I just cringe, partially because it's nearly 2017 and I can't believe people still like that kind of story, or the fact that I actually wrote that kind of story. As for the nice things, well, I guess it is nice that some people can still appreciate crap and haven't become jaded.

*** Pretty much this in my experience. I've not reread my most popular story in over five years. Readers leave reviews I can't even answer because it's been so long since I last visited the text.

I'm sorely tempted to just delete my entire collection of stories. (Or maybe just my fanfiction gmail account.)

Edit: Regarding original fiction, I've published a heap of stories and am shopping a couple of novels. I never make an association to my fanfiction so it's never been a problem.

**** Please don't delete your stories. Many people clearly like them, and nothing is worse than having your favorite stories pulled unexpectedly and without explanation. If you are no longer active, just say that in your profile and stop reading the messages.

On a related note, I think that one of the best features on Ao3 (other than tags) is the ability to orphan individual stories or even entire accounts. orphan_account has thousands upon thousands of stories, and I imagine a great many of them would be gone forever otherwise.

***** I won't delete them.

I've only deleted three stories in my history on fanfiction.net. One was the sequel to /Dagger and Rose/, about seven chapters in (reviews were such that I figured I should cut my losses and quit the [completed] story vs. post it). One, I learned after the fact, could be interpreted as homophobic and I was uncomfortable with that. (This was not my intention with the story.) And the last ran into Orson Scott Card's lawyers and a CAD.

  There have to be a few good and bad experiences, like having a really nice reviewer review all of your chapters, or having a Guest reviewer leave a really mean review and not being able to reply. Any stories? Any experiences?
#+end_quote

Now I think you're asking the wrong questions. Even I have had all those things and my reviews are mostly in double figures and unlikely to increase now. I'd be more interested to know if having a very popular story with lots of favourites, reviews etc brings with it a sense of obligation. Does it begin to weigh down on you? And if you make the jump into writing original fiction and seeking traditional publication, what do you intend to do with your fanfiction?

Does having a very popular story with lots of favourites, reviews etc brings with it a sense of obligation?

- Only in the sense that I would be disappointed in myself if I didn't finish.

Does it begin to weigh down on you?

- Not any more than writing short stories or finding road blocks in writing less popular stories. Maybe in the past, getting stuck on a chapter would weigh on me in the sense that I owed it to my readers to produce a chapter, no matter the quality. Now, I tend not to feel the same way.

If you make the jump into writing original fiction and seeking traditional publication, what do you intend to do with your fanfiction?

- Probably leave most of my longer fics up. I haven't written anything so controversial that it would be a detriment to a prospective original fiction career.

Most people that review my stories have very nice things to say. About 80% of the reviews are simply congratulatory or asking for an update. 10% have some longer form reviews (which I enjoy the most) and expand on some of the foreshadowing I place in fics. About 5% of reviews are complaints about certain characters or plot points. The last 5% are users telling me I'm the worst writer ever.

For the most part, I enjoy reading a majority of reviews and try to take some time to respond to the longer reviews or to those who have very specific questions. I've been lucky enough not to be put on a 'shame' list or 'worst story' list, so I haven't had a lot of trolls or detractors blow up my review page. I've read reviews of popular fics that get put on the 'shame' list and feel some sympathy for the author when I read some of the nastier reviews. I'm a strong proponent of constructive criticism, even when it is caustic. I'm not a strong believer in flaming or disguising insults as criticisms. At the end of day, a majority of authors want to put out a good story. Sometimes they need to be told it's not a good story, but I don't think any good comes of telling people they should never write again.

To answer the question in the title, it is encouraging to know that the vast majority of readers enjoy my writing. At the same time, negative reviews makes you question whether the popularity of your fic is based on your writing or if you just happened to hit a certain nerve in the fanfic world at the time. Given the proliferation of not so well written fics that still have thousands of your reviews, it can sometimes be deceiving how well you think you actually write.
