#+TITLE: I just got this really nice review on an old story that nudged me towards thinking rewriting it is viable because he saw the allusions I was making even through the heavy handed overlay. Ever happen to you?

** I still get a lot of reviews on my old stuff, mostly praise. Usually, I can't help but think how shitty their taste is if they think that nonsense is good.

On the other hand, I do get people pointing out various mistakes in the old stories and giving a genuine critique, and all I can think of is that it's 8 years old and I state the story is bad right in my profile so the effort expended to review is literally pointless since I've come a long way since then.

** Yeah. They're really great. One guy saw right through all of the overlay I had in the chapter of my story in which Ravenclaw creates the first house elves by sacrificing her own mother and saw the metaphor in his first read. I was really happy that someone understood it despite it being so veiled.

** Nope. Most idiots who read my story are weirdos who are there to jerk off at the sex scenes. Not exactly the reviewing crowd.
