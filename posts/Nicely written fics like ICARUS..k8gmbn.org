Icarus by marbleglove is one of my favourite fics. I am looking for fics like this that is well thought and have a different premise than canon


** Icarus had such a fun premise, and I agree, it was well thought out and executed. That is, up to chapter 8 where out of the blue Hermione falls in love with Voldemort. I actually laughed out loud at that point, which for me, turned the the whole fic into a crack fic. This got further cemented by chapters 9 and 10 in which the story goes fully off the rails (Hermione hiding one of his Horcruxes for example).

Sorry for the small rant, was just really disappointing how that story turned out.

Now for a recc, this has a similarly unique premise and is very well written and executed.

Also, many of the other fics in his "boy with a scar" collection would fit too, they explore a different "what if" scenario each time.

  When Petunia Dursley refused to take Harry in she forfeited his birthright protection, so Dumbledore took the baby to the safest place he knew: Hogwarts.The applicable staff (mostly just... not Snape) took Harry in on a rotating schedule as he grew from baby to toddler to child. They traded extra credit for babysitting among the older students, and Harry grew up knowing a few dozen different laps that were safe and warm to nap in.This was a Harry who grew up among books, among old transient walls and learned professors. They gave Binns night duty sometimes, and let him talk young Harry to sleep. This was a Harry whose world changed, on principle, daily. The stairs moved. The walls became doors. You had to keep your eyes open--you had to pay attention. So he did.He grew up in a school. Knowledge was power, but knowledge was also joy. This was his sanctuary. There was magic in his world from birth.

  Before Harry's sixth year, he never thought a great deal about how wizards Sort others: by blood, by allegiance, and by House. When those strictures begin to crumble, Harry must find his own way without relying on prejudice or presumption, aided by Severus Snape, Remus Lupin, and an increasingly enigmatic Draco Malfoy. This story is now COMPLETE! <3 Thanks so much to everyone who read and reviewed!Join me in the sequel starting in December, Geas of Gryffindor. For those of you new to the story, yes, this part does come to a distinct end. ;)-K
