So, what's your opinion of the fic?


** Was all right. Spirit Ginny was a little creepy, but everything else was pretty fun to experience.

I LOVED IT. Read it like 5 times, just such an easy read! Harry's powers are cool as fuck too

** I'm of the opinion that it's still the best story to try and get someone into fanfiction with. Sure, it's not perfect and there are some parts that could be trimmed down on (Ginny's ghost for example), but it's a really good example of what can be done in the HP universe when a bit of creativity and humor are applied.

*** Is there anything specific that makes this fic be praised as amazing or funny? I tried getting into it a few times and into a few other nonjon fics, but have always stopped a few chapters in since nothing about it seems funny at all and the plot and writing style is very clipped and unnatural and seems boring to me. The fact that everyone praises this fic is very confusing. Although I don't really care for sex jokes or for crude humour which it seems to use quite a bit so maybe that's it?

***** Not everyone's sense of humour is the same. There is plenty of comedy that I enjoy, what makes raunchy humour based on who bangs who and vulgar vocabulary better than other types of humour?

** I actually reread it like last week. I was a bit confused, because I remember LOVING it (this was probably my fourth read-through), but this time, most of the jokes fell pretty flat on me. It might just have been that I had already seen them a few times, but it's more likely, I think, that I'm bothered a lot by the blatant sexism and latent homophobia now, and I was a lot younger when I read it first. There were still a few moments when I burst out laughing, but those tended to be more innocent... the sexual hijinks were no longer something I found worth while.

This probably reflects a broader change in thge types of stories I'm interested in from ABC/HPMOR and their ilk to stuff more like Etc. Etc. & life goes on, but I don't know!

AT the end of the day, I think A Black Comedy is still; clever and witty (just look at its name), and one of premier fics of the fandom. It's just not my type of fic any more.

**** I don't think it depends on how much fanfiction you read. I tried reading it but I was just really bored and the humour, the plot and the writing itself in it did nothing for me. Although I did not make it past a few chapters, so maybe I'm missing something. But then again, if I remember correctly, it seems to use a lot of sex jokes and crude humour and that just turns me off. Seventh horcrux on the other hand I find extremely funny.

**** Yea, I agree. Crack fics were never my thing to begin with, as it's become a trope in itself. I'm sure at that time it was 'innovative', but at this point it just seems like an excuse to write something terrible and still get a lot of favourites because "It's supposed to be terrible."

** I didn't like it the first time I read it. Ghost Ginny irritated me and the nightly "oh no, we brought home two women who knew each other, how shocking!" made me roll my eyes. I eventually came back to it and saw the funny bits, I still skim over Ghost Ginny during rereads, but I love their Job. I like that they do their own thing instead of letting Dumbledore make choices for them. It pokes fun at wizarding logic without going overboard.

** I've never been able to get into it. Been thinking of giving it another go though.

From what I remember, there's a lot of Slytherin bashing and Sirius Black, neither of which I tend to like outside of canon. As for the writing, there's a lot of ribaldry and not a lot of actual jokes--maybe it's just not the fic for me.
