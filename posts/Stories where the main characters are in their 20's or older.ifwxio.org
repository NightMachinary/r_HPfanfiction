As I get older, the more and more I want older main characters, a ton of the stories deal with the characters time during Hogwarts, which I understand, it's an easy topic to write about, I'd just like something more.

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can be any length, can be old or new, would rather it be completed but if not that's fine.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes and the like (doesn't have to focus on a pairing).

No Character Bashing. An author going out of their way to hate on a character and make them evil when they aren't is a no go.


** [[https://wwwfanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/][A Black Comedy]], linkffn(3401052$: Harry falls through the Veil and joins Sirius in a new dimension. Voldemort is still around, but gets derailed by that "fucker".

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6989327/1/][Children's Crusade]], linkffn(6989327): 4 years after the Battle, a Hermione from another dimension asks for help. The Trio and Ginny once more enter the breach.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/][Contractual Invalidation]], linkffn(11697407): Head Auror Harry Potter uses Daphne Greengrass to advance his career and agenda.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): It's one of the very few fics that has Harry raised by his own parents, but he is not a nice guy. Dark war epic, most of the story takes place after 2008.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13618513/1/half-awake-and-almost-there][half awake and almost there]], linkffn(13618513): Muggle AU, but a great Harry/Ginny romance. They are both college students. Harry has an interesting background, while Ginny has a tragic one.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12925628/1/][Interview with Director Potter]], linkffn(12925628): My own one shot for the Battle's 20 year anniversary. Harry talks about the past, present, and the future.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13161929/1/][Invincible]], linkffn(13161929): 2009, the Earth is slowly turning uninhabitable for Magicals. Harry leads his people to convert the retired aircraft carrier HMS Invincible into a spaceship. Out there, they meet the remnants of the Colonial Fleet and Cylons.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11994595/1/][Perfectly Normal Thank You Very Much]], linkffn(11994595): Dudley has a witch daughter and asks Harry for help.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/Petunia-Evans-Tomb-Raider][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]], linkffn(13052802): Petunia is a squib and a BAMF archeologist. She, Sirius, Bill, and Fleur did the heavy lifting against Voldemort in this fic. In its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13111277/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Secret-of-Atlantis][Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis]], linkffn(13111277), the Trio works as Cursed Breakers in search of Atlantis. The quest takes all over the world.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6092362/1/][Shadow Walks]], linkffn(6092362): 5 years after the War, Harry embarks on a big dimensional journey to find Hermione.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]], linkffn(6331126): My favorite canon compliant postwar fic, and is part of a massive 85+ story series. This one depicts Harry and Ginny's work/life in 2009, narrated from their Muggle neighbor's POV.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7502511/1/][The Sea King]], linkffn(7502511): Beautiful Harry/Hermione one shot 19 years later, set in Alaska.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): My favorite postwar fic overall. Here, Harry and his friends declare war on the incorrigible Ministry and Wizengamot. They begin with vigilante killings of Death Eaters who have escaped justice again.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/][The Voyage of Starship Hedwig]], linkffn(7135971): Still the only non crossover “Wizards in space” story. Lots of problems, but still worth reading imho.

  Summer, 1999. Harry comes home with news. Quite a lot of news. Harry takes a deep breath.“I'm quitting the Aurors,” he starts with, which is followed by a moment of stunned silence.“What?” Sirius says.“All right," Remus says. “Do you know what else you want to do? Did you think about it?”Harry blushes, the way James used to---a rosy glow lighting up his brown skin---and says, “I wanted to---that is, I thought I might be a teacher.”Remus, quite suddenly, seems to have something in his eye. "Oh."“What?” Sirius says.“And uh---there's more. I was thinking I might like to. That is. I want to become an Animagus.”

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] has a lot of post-Hogwarts stories. Some follow Harry/Ginny and their children, some are about Lavender Brown, some are about Harry's Auror team and their interactions with the Muggle world. I quite liked linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh), where Harry and Ginny and their young children have just moved into a new neighbourhood in the countryside, told mostly through the eyes of one of their nonmagical neighbours.

linkffn(The Peace Not Promised) is a bit of a mixed bag in terms of age; it alternates between the point of view of Severus, who has been sent back to his teenage years after his canonical death and is therefore mentally 38+, and Lily, who is sixteen as the story starts. It's generally an adult perspective, though; it follows Severus and Lily over the next several years through marriage and the war, it's never about them being eleven and twelve. I really like how it examines Severus' character in detail, recognising his strengths and his flaws, and his devotion to Lily that shapes everything he does. Incomplete but updating steadily each month and not far from the endgame.

** I have a few stories where the leads are adults, but the main one involves an OC/Sirius OC/Remus pairing, here: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17070020]] (it's... long, lol.)

There's also this Remus/Hermione story where she's in her 20's and he didn't really die, Post-Hogwarts: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13010406]] (not really kidfic but she is Teddy's mom, only about 10% of the story is about Teddy though)

** Here are my favorites: linkffn(Dudley's Memories) : Adult Auror Harry reunites with adult social worker Dudley to break the news about Dudley's daughter, Eleanor. linkffn(Snape's Memories): sequel to Dudley's Memories. Adult Harry fosters a traumatized 7 year old boy. Beautiful and canon-compliant. linkffn(13657777) : A weird one in that it involves both an adult Harry (in the first scene, reminiscing), and a pre Hogwarts child Harry (most of the rest). This one is tragic, I warn you. But if you can handle that, it's haunting and beautiful.

  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".

  Sort of a sequel and a companion piece to Dudley's Memories. Harry is finding a healthy outlet for his "saving people thing" in the form of one damaged little boy. In doing so he finds himself thinking about his old teacher, quite a bit.

  Oneshot, Abused!Harry. Before Hedwig the owl, there was Alastair the spider. In an unforgiving household, 10-year-old Harry has no one else who cares whether he lives or dies. He'll need every ounce of vigilance if he is to survive. Warning: descriptions of physical child abuse.
