I'm looking for fics that go deeply into magical theory in any or multiple subjects. No slash please, but anything else is fine. Even femslash if necessary, although I'd prefer straight characters.


** Linkffn(The Arithmancer)

Great story, and you even learn about some concepts that come in useful in real math.

** I'm currently co-writing a story with complex magical worldbuilding. Our genre is Gen Angst/Whump, so any romance will be treated as a subplot, in a similar vein to canon, but will include some non-hetero relationships.

If you're interested, you can find it on ao3 and ffnet: linkao3(A Lamb Before the Slaughter)

  Terror and destruction seemed inevitable after Voldemort finally revealed himself to the Wizarding World but, at Hogwarts, Harry lives a disturbingly unchanged life. He exists in parallel to the people around him and, as time passes, the line between friend and foe stretches into a complex gradient, difficult to decipher. Seeking desperately to become the hero the Order needs, it becomes more and more clear to him how dangerous that prospect is.But, in a life fraught with crisis and tragedy, what's just a little more?
