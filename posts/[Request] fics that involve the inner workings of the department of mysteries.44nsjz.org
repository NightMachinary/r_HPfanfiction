basically any fics where the characters work there, infiltrate it, learn about it, whatever. just a more in depth look at what exactly the unspeakables do there. doesn't have to be canon complaint at all.


** Whatever else may come up, I should mention linkffn(HP and the Summer of Change by lorddwar). An old pillar of the Harry/Tonks ship, it includes quite a bit about the 'field' side of the Department of Mysteries.
