:FlairText: Recommendation
:END:
Looking for some unique recommendations in the hope that somebody else has had the same idea as me but had the energy to write it out.

I'm thinking good Petunia (although I think I've read most of them), Muggle central stories like perhaps Harry has a very kind school teacher that helps him out Matilda style, ANY good OC that ends up teaching at Hogwarts (but not as an assistant) in whatever era, somebody raises Tom Riddle with love, a muggle adopts Tom as a child, Regulus lives (again, pretty sure I've read most of them), any good Sirius escapes earlier books, one of the Dursleys neighbours notices Harry, something involving centaurs, good male OCs, ect.

Basically if it involves a character we don't hear about a lot, or my fave troubled boys (Tom, Snape, Regulus, Harry, the 4 corners of the lonely sad boy square), ANY good muggle intervention Miss Honey style, magical creatures, then I'd love to read it. I'm a sucker for character interactions and development.

But please, nothing with Harry/Hermione, ANYONE being overpowered (that means no wizard nobility or royalty beyond canon thank you very much), no goblins making Harry conveniently rich and powerful, no Weasley or excessive Dumbledore bashing, or OCs that risk Mary-Sue-ish behavior, no genius Harry either, or stories that read like a metaphysics thesis. Also I hate a story that ends up with the plot progressing exactly as it does in canon because I feel like I've wasted my time reading it. Also nothing where the characters resemble canon only in name.

(Also nothing too American, it's very jarring to read all the wrong lingo although most of the time I can push past it)

I know I'm asking for a lot but I'm hoping to find some real hidden gems, since whenever I sort my search on FFnet by favourites, I end up hating what's popular for the exact reasons above.

Edit: I also forgot! I really love the Black family so if there's anything unique including perhaps a OC/Orion that ends up with Sirius and Reg having a much kinder mother, or an OC Black that isn't unbearable, I love stuff like that too.


** In the "good Petunia" department, have you read /By Baker Street Station, I Sat Down and Wept,/ by Deco? It's not yet complete, but the author is active and I hope they'll come back to it.

  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.

**** I'm glad you liked it!

Even though it doesn't entirely meet your criteria, you might like my WIP, /Loose Cannon/. I should warn you that I originally intended Harmione, but the characters seem to be heading in another direction, so I now consider that outcome very unlikely.

  Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Heaps of dialogue and world-building, and OCs galore. Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. NO MORTAL PERIL.

** For Black Family stories, go read Marie Kavanagh s work on Ao3!! She portrays a really good Black family that isn't just one big angry abusive household. Orion and Walburga are caring in their own way. linkao3(The Dog Days of Summer) is one of their works.

linkao3(Blackpool by TheDivineComedian) as well is brilliant. Again, a unique look into the Black family. A bit darker than Kavanaghs work but still fantastic!! They have a Petunia story too though I haven't read that because I'm not fond of petunia... But Ive no doubt it's brilliant.

**** You can ask if you need help? I'll do my best üòä. It took me ages. I filter by exclusion and sort by kudos..

So I exclude any pairings I really don't or eras. Kudos are likes so the more of those generally the better.

Then when I find an author I like I look at the stories they have bookmarked? Generally if I like an author I'll like what that author is reading? It's a good way to get started anyway!

The tags helped when I got better at Ao3. So I really like Black family stories, so clicking that tag brought up a load of good fics. Walburgas A+ Parenting also helped me find some stories I liked. That kinda thing üòä but ao3 can be real touch and go with the tags!!

Using what my favourite authors had bookmarked was more consistent. At finding good stories

**** The Dog Days of Summer is a black family story so Sirius is like... 8 I think? So no it doesn't change canon. At least, it's happening too early for cannon to be relevant.

Unless you canon VERY hard that Sirius does not have a dog ever in his childhood üòã.

All of Marie Kavanaghs stories can be read as canon compliant as far as I remember aside from Circinius,

All of TheDivineComedians work can also be read as canon compliant...

Both deal with side stories and back stories so nothing important enough happens in them to affect the canon of the story üòä

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?
