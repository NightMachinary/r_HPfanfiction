** This fic fits your criteria: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11420609/1/The-Wizard-Who-Meddled-With-Time]]). It has Harry as a chronomacer and was pretty good last time I read it, but I read it 2 years ago so I'm not sure if it'll still hold up.

**** I think that slash is a pox on the fandom and the world in general but I still enjoyed the fic. It's pretty easy to skip over the chunks of graphic stuff in there.

**** It happens and attention is drawn to it happening but it's not a focused point. More something that the characters just kinda do.
