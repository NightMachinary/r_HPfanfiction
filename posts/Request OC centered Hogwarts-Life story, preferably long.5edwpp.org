#+begin_quote
  This is the first of a series of books I wrote for my kids set in the Harry Potter setting and occurring at the same time. These stories are meant to interweave seamlessly with the HP books and focus on characters primarily in the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff houses. The Tamblin books are a tad darker than the HP books, starting at about the level of the 3rd or 4th HP book.

  The third Tamblin story. Family issues. A descent into madness. A shocking crime. I wrote this story with a different style from the Harry Potter formula as an experiment. It begins in medias res, covers about half the school year, and is told through flashbacks.

**** Okay well I really liked [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4260581/1/Lessons-Learned][Lessons Learned]] and the sequel. Some of the characters were really hate-able but in a good way haha.

Also [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7737991][Put Your Guns Away It's Tea Time]] is really great. It's Cursed Child compliant, so not as OC feeling as Lessons Learned but the writing is GREAT. There's a sequel too that's being frequently updated. Linkffn(4260581), linkao3(7737991)

  Ginny Potter estimates it will only take three days into the Weasley-Potter family holiday for Albus to act on his feelings for his best friend. Albus estimates it will only take three days for him to die of embarrassment. And Scorpius, well. Scorpius is just glad to be there with Albus in the first place.

  My shrink says I repress feelings and emotions. She told me once that I have trouble “admitting reality” to myself. Now, I don't know if that's true. After all, I don't have the fancy Psychological Healing degree, do I?
