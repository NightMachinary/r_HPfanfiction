Anyone know of good stories that have people traveling back in time a long way?

I like time travel, but am kinda annoyed that it always ends up with going only 20-30 years back. Am currently reading linkffn(Flight of the Stars by darkladyswan), that's kinda what I'm looking for. Riddle era, even before that.


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10709411/1/][Basilisk-Born]] by Ebenbild. Harry potter is transported back to the time before the founders. Very good. A few funny plot twists. Almost complete. FFNet.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A_Second_Chance_at_Life][A second Chance at Life]] by Miranda Flairgold. Harry goes to a different school.. where survival of the fittest is the law of the land. Has timetravel elements but not the main focus of the story. Vampires! Aztecs! Dark magic! Necromancy! Complete but the sequel is unfinished. FFNet.

If you want Harry potter characters in medieval times, I can recommend some really excellent Game of thrones Crossovers. Even if you don't know the series they are worth it. Also there are a couple star wars or Avatar crossovers that are set in space.. so it's like timetravel going forward.

** !linkao3(Of a Linear Circle Part 3 by Flamethrower)

Harry gets sent back in time after GoF and meets the Founders. But it's more than that.

He needs to learn Old English to communicate. Magic is a lot more detailed and descriptive. He learns wandlore and tree speaking. Mind Magic to get rid of the Horcrux. He needs to adjust to the clothing, the castle, the people who are from 990 Britain so Celts, Vikings, Britons, Gauls. The Founders have their own heritage and stories. It's so incredibly intricate and detailed and you'll learn so much about history and language and people and you'll fall in love with Salazar because he's amazing and the history makes sense and I bloody love this story!

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the conjoining of paragons)

This just started, but the author is very talented. Anything he's written at least in 2020 has been excellent, and the premise of this is interesting in the fact that it is sort of a subversion of the typical Harry/TMR. He also seems to write an absurd amount, so updates should be fairly regular, even though he said at the end of chapter 1 they won't be weekly.

  When Harry and Voldemort died at each others hands, Harry awoke in an alley as a ten year old girl. Perplexed at this turn of events but not overly surprised, she is taken to Wool's Orphanage. Now known as Iris Black, she is roomed with Tom Riddle, who she decides to befriend because honestly, why not see how things unfold from the other side? It might be fun.
