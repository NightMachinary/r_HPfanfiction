INT. HOSPITAL ROOM

RON: The baby's due soon.

He grasps Harry's unmoving hand. His fingers are icy. The nurse said the cold will help him heal, but he can't stop wishing for warmth, any sign that Harry is still alive.

HARRY: ...

RON: Hermione's excited to be a mum. You know she'd be here but... I just needed to talk to you alone.

Ron pushes a strand of Harry's hair up away from his face. It's as unruly as ever, now almost the same length as Sirius's on the run.

RON: This style doesn't suit you, mate. Haven't they been giving you cuts? Bloody fucking facility. You'd think they'd give more attention to the Saviour of Magical Britain or whatever shite they're calling you nowadays.

Ron pulls his hands away.

RON: (chuckles) I guess you wouldn't like that title any better than your old one.

HARRY: ...

RON: Look at me, already acting like a dad. I wish you could be there to see her when she's born. The mediwizard ran an imaging spell and she's so... perfect. No beaks or fins yet, you'll be happy to know.

HARRY: ...

RON: We're naming her after you. Of course, every other baby nowadays is named Harry something-or-another. But this is a little different, isn't it?

HARRY: ...

Ron rests his head on his hands. A noise, suspiciously close to a sob, escapes his lips.

RON: I'll cock everything up, won't I? Just like I always did, back at school. Probably already am. You know Dad had Bill & Charlie when he was younger than me?

HARRY: ...

RON: But I have to try, right? I can't be worse than the Dursleys and you turned out alright. Other than, you know.

HARRY: ...

RON: I love Hermione. I love our baby. I just...

Ron wipes his eyes with his sleeve, grateful his mother isn't here to call him out.

RON: Dammit.


** This is *fantastic* and I find myself wishing it were a whole fic!

*** Thanks! I'm not really sure how to go on from here; I might make other scenes set in the same AU or continue Ron's story or both.

If you don't mind me asking, is there anything in particular in the scene you especially liked?

**** The emotion that Ron felt was really well done, I felt it easily. I think you balanced having questions and answers really well, so I'm curious but not so confused that I don't want to bother continuing. I want to know what happened to Harry, why the cold would help. I want to know how Ron and Hermione have done, and see how Harry reacts to that if/when he wakes up.

** Take a look at this little thing: [[https://i.warosu.org/data/ic/img/0041/95/1573086596094.jpg]]

It's a graph of a person's skill at producing art and their skill at critiquing said art. It may just be that your skill in writing dialogue is just fine (which I think it totally is), but your doubts come from being too good at recognizing your own flaws.

Over all, I think what you wrote is pretty good. If you're still worried, just practice more. That's all there is to it.

*** It's more that I don't feel uncomfortable writing dialogue tbh and wanted to test my boundaries. Thanks for the feedback :)

**** Putting up front that I really enjoyed your scene --

I think that if you want to work on dialogue, you need to have at least two active participants in the conversation. That's what makes it really tricky. In this case, because Harry isn't participating, beyond the obvious part of not being able to judge their interaction, we also can't really grasp how natural or unnatural this dialogue is. I think you'll be able to get better feedback with a scene that has conversation.

Yeah, for sure. I'm writing a bunch of random scenes; this is just the first.

** I think you did Ron well here, the dialogue and actions really work in conveying a personal sense if what he is experiencing.
