I'm looking for fics where the protagonist is a feared ruler, like Emperor or something. I recently read a fic which had a good sentence to sum up what I'm looking for. It went something like this: "I was so feared as an Emperor that people named whole constellations after me just to satisfy my galactical ego." I hope you have something along these lines :) If it is a fem harry, thats a plus

I think that's as close as I could get to your criteria. Be ready though, that fic is epic length.
