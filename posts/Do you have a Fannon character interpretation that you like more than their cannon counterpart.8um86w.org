What characters do you like better in fanfiction compared to their interpretation in the books? I feel like there could be a lot of great points of discussion for this, since it seems every character goes through a period of revisionist history and/or demonization


** Hedwig.

*Canon*: basically a symbol of Harry's connection to the Wizarding world, then an avatar of his anger, finally treated like an action figure accessory in the Battle of Seven Potters, where she is stuck in a cage during an AERIAL battle, until murdered. At least in the movies they had the good sense to allow her to actively sacrifice her life for Harry.

*Fanon*: when included, she has a subtle humour and critical attitude, sometimes edging toward R2-D2 levels of competence and utility. Fanfiction makes her a symbol of familial care and oversight, rather than just a special effect.

** Voldemort. Canon Voldemort falls into the stereotypical bad guy that somehow manages to do stupid things to somehow botch an easy victory. Fanon lets us see some truly incredible Voldemort's from POTDK to the Firebird Trilogy or even LDS. Those characterizations aren't necessarily consistent but they give more depth to a character that sorely needs it.

I especially like the Firebird Trilogy that has him become a /Dark Lord/ for reasons other than "muh power" or "eviiiilll". I think canon does him (and the Death Eaters) a disservice by making them just another group of baddies. Villains don't have to be pure evil and it is much more interesting to have them be on the edge of evil rather than satan incarnate.

Mindless casting of the cruciatus and endless killing curses are a great example of fanon (and to some extent canon) butchering his character. Voldemort is ambitious, cunning, and has a thirst for power. His characterization has to reflect that. Furthermore *Voldemort is not pure evil.* Voldemort doesn't do bad things for the sake of them, but rather to pursue greater power. This is in my mind a very important distinction. Motivation is just as important as the actions as themselves.

** I tend to like Tonks in most fics where she is more than a background character.

In canon: New Auror with metamorph powers and is dead clumsy (somehow got into the equivalent of the FBI), turns into a weird love interest for someone twice her age. Dies off screen.

In fanon: A well trained Auror, student of Mad-Eye, with metamorph powers and only somewhat clumsy. Funny, smart, and generally able to put Harry and co on their asses in a duel because an Auror should be able to woop on some teenagers.

Mostly, I felt like she was a wasted character, and Remus is kind of a terrible person so I didn't like the pairing.

*** Whilst I don't disagree with you on the use of Tonks, I think the clumsy makes sense in context. If someone's body was constantly shifting in proportion, size, and weight, it stands to reason that you wouldn't consciously know where in space your body was, since the shifting seems to be unconscious as well. When she consciously shifts, it might be easier to actively control where the body exists in space, so it's easier to avoid detection, but that would take some serious concentration, since shifting is so easy to do by accident.

You have to remember that this IS magic, so who is to say that another metamorph might not be just fine? Maybe magic does balance out the senses when they shift and tonks would normally be fatally clumsy without it lol.

*** What makes Remus a terrible character?

Was it the fact that he never stood up against the bullying done by the only friends he'd ever known, and the only friends he had who accepted his furry little problem? He owes everything to them. Standing up against them and possibly losing his friends would have been his worst nightmare. Something he would later go through. Twice. Once in 1981 when he woke up to find James, Lily, and Peter dead, and Sirius in jail, and again when Sirius went through the veil.

Or was he kind of terrible because he was super freaked out about becoming a dad and possibly passing down a terrible curse onto his innocent child? All he needed was Harry telling him, "shut the fuck up and go be with your wife" and he was good.

He is certainly a flawed character, and he's no hero, but a terrible person? I don't see it.

**** Or, you know, didn't try to contact his best friend's son, the only link he thought was left to those friends you were talking about, for 11 years.

Remus is not bad for not standing up to his friends, but he is weak for it. Hermione had no problem standing up to Ron and Harry in 3rd year because she thought it was the best thing for them. Neville stood up to them in 1st year. Good friends will tell each other when they are being stupid. So either he was too weak and afraid to challenge them, or he condoned it. But honestly, that's not even the reason I dislike him.

I'm sorry, but defending the 'I'm ready to abandon both my wife and newborn child' is kind of ludicrous. The only reason he went back was because Harry wouldn't let him come. He would have actually abandoned them if Harry had let him. It wasn't like Remus changed his mind voluntarily. I would have been fine if Harry had said yes and then Remus changed his mind.

Mind you, the Lupins were both stupid enough to get killed in the same place. At least one of them should have stayed behind for their son.

** Draco in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12088294/1/Animagus-at-War][Animagus at War]], linkffn(12088294): His redemption arc is a lot more convincing than in canon. He is actually thinking. Even his pranks against Harry are well played.

Dumbledore in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877). He's totally manipulative and ruthless, but only against the bad guys.

Ginny in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling]], linkffn(6919395): Her growth in this story is phenomenal. I like this version of her a lot better than Canon.

Harry in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): He becomes increasingly brutal as the story goes on, and yet he remains fiercely protective of his friends. When he and Hermione are going on that suicide mission in the end, he 'orders' Neville to stay behind.

Hermione in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925): I have my greatest sympathy and respect for this Hermione, I wish she and Harry could get together in their new world.

Ron in [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: Now, that's a role model for a fun and loyal friend.

Voldemort in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron][Patron]], linkffn(11080542): Dumbledore is on top of his game, Harry is training hard, Lockhart is not a fraud, Fudge and his Ministry are reasonable, even Pansy is redeeming herself. But all that would not be enough, if Hermione and Aberforth has not picked up the slack. This Voldemort is brilliant and scary. No, canon Horcrux hunt would have never worked.

If Snape would have survived and Nuremberg style trials held, regardless of the final verdict it would have been examined whether or not the good he made by switching side outweigh the actions he took while on the DE side.

.

Also, just because one of the victims say "I forgive you", that doesn't mean that they don't want them to go in jail. Or that the other victims share that point of view. It happens that a victim forgive the criminal for a crime, because they understand and have compassion/pity for the circumstances that lead to said crime but that doesn't mean that the criminal is allowed to walk away scot free.

******** He became someone who could not forgive a child for surviving when his mother didn't because of what he himself had done. He became someone who took petty pleasure at making select people suffer, people who by all means should be on his side and actually were.

Even villains can do heroic things. He may not have been a villain, no, and he did do something heroic, brave, and of great import, but I stand by my opinion that he was not a hero. His reasons for switching sides were selfish, what he did after switching likewise, and we do not know how much he did because he chose to and how much because he did not want to go against Dumbledore, i.e. the one person who accepted him after what he'd done.

again, baseless headcanon. when snape doesn't want to do something, he doesn't do it. like when dumbledore ordered him to teach harry occlumency but he stopped because harry annoyed him, or when dumbledore told him to help lupin and he did the exact opposite, or when he threatened to renege on their deal to kill dumbledore until he told him more information. snape goes against dumbledore all the time

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

The wife did die, but not the daughter) and Azkaban was well done and you can really relate to him and how he behaves later on around both Harry and Acquila (his daughter, obviously).

I like the one from "Son of Potter, Daughter of Black" too, basically same reasons as Black bond, minus the AU part.

But probably the one I like the most is the one from "Too far from home" mostly because there's 2 of him and they're both so different because of their pasts but also stay true to his core personality.
