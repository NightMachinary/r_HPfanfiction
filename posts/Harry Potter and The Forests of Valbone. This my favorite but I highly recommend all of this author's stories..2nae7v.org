**** I agree. I enjoyed some of his other work much more.

This one seemed too much crackfic ish. I could not read more than first 15 or so chapters. I just could not go on.

Is it worth it to go back and read it again now that it is nearly complete?

***** About half way through it loses its moral seriousness. Instead of engaging with the emotions created by suffering, it becomes about attacking goblins.

** One should note that despite it not being marked "Completed", it is, more or less. The author's note at the end says there will be one more chapter (where Harry isn't the main character), but it was never posted. There is also a claim of a potential sequel, but that hasn't materialized.
