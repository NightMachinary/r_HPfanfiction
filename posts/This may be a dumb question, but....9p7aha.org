** Cause he's obsessive and weird.

More seriously though it might be the fics you're reading cause I've never read a fic where he had a foot fetish

******* It's a strange world. There are so many, particularly Snape/Hermione. I started because there were a couple of really good BDSM types that I loved and I've been trawling ever since to find more. Alas, I've ended up writing my own because there's bloody well nothing. That is to say, good ones are rare and bad ones are like cane toads.

******** Have you checked out OracleObscured's work? It's really good, and a lot of it is bdsm.

If you tell me what you like aside from kink I can probably rec you a couple of good ones, but OO and For The Potions Master's Amusement are really the only BDSM fics I know, since that's not really my thing.

********** I get the impression that OracleObscured has really done her research or is in the lifestyle herself, so you might be safe there. Personally I prefer linkao3(Getting Personal by OracleObscured) over linkao3(Teaching Miss Granger) because the Snape in GP is a lot kinder than one in TMG, who is sometimes very harsh. She's also doing a story, Quartet, which is an SS/HG/DM/LM story which explores a variety of BDSM themes, including Daddy and femdom. Hermione has a unique relationship with each of the three men, and its surprisingly sweet. No incest, although DM and LM do work on their father/son relationship throughout.

Lissadream and Snowblind also did a fic with BDSM themes(can't remember the name, sorry). They had a lot of help from the comments section wrt BDSM practises and so on, and the story ended up quite good.

(I hope I did the linking thing right, I'm rubbish at that kind of thing)

******** The point is, completely ignoring the fact that Snape belongs into Azkaban like any other Death Eater, and ignoring the whole statutory rape aspect, Snape had only one person he "loved", or obsessed over. Him "caring" about anyone but Lily would be incredibly OOC. And since he voluntarily joined the Death Eaters, even that actually becoming a relationship would be unbelievable since he chose his shady friends over Lily.

Therefore Snape romances are not popular around here. And that's not even taking the other problems into consideration.

********* I think there's a more acute explanation to the Snape-fics hate -- bias. Few are bothered by divergence (and OOC) from canon when it is /their/ fantasy that's being fulfilled. Harry/Daphne or Harry/Tonks threads are insanely popular even though they have no basis in the established universe. And yet people can't seem to apply the same standard to Snape. It's an inherent hypocrisy, where the only "acceptable" changes are the popular ones.

********** The difference between Snape and Tonks is that Snape willingly joined the organisation who killed Tonks and only turned traitor because he didn't get his dick wet after he conveniently caused the death of his rival. Snape abused his power to ruin an entire generation since his unreasonably high standards starved the economy of talented potioneers. He picked on children and bullied them for his own amusement or over a grudge with a man dead a decade. Tonks made silly faces and was the only badass women we see on screen (Hermione, Ginny and Luna are underage for most of the series, Bellatrix is cool evil and Lily only appears in flashbacks).

Of course people hate Snape, he joined the magical Nazis on his own. He, as a teacher, bullied children. He was an incredibly petty man. But that does not invalidate any of the points I made above. It is not OOC for Tonks or Daphne to end up with Harry/Hermione, but it would be completely out of character for Snape.

*********** Well, as I said, if you can accept divergence to canon for Harry, you should be able to accept divergence for Snape...you just don't /want/ to, because you hate the guy.

Also, I'm not sure how it can be in-character for Daphne or Tonks to fall in love with Harry...as Daphne is a complete blank slate in canon (so any fanfic is automatically a fabrication of her character) and Tonks -- well, she's not a bad person -- but she never, ever, displayed any kind of romantic affection for Harry.

** Sigyn99, I have read through maybe 2000, more, in Fanfaction stories, and I can honestly say that other than Dumbledore and Dobby, I have never seen a story were a person had a foot\feet\sock fetish. I'd like to see one story where Snape has one, because, if your saying Snape always seem to have a foot fetish in every work you read, I'm missing something, or your reading in a different site than I do.

I don't know how you look for new fic to read, but maybe try to find something that's /not/ recommended by the foot-fetish-writing authors.
