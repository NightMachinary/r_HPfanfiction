I read most of the Grey Maiden, but I'm curious if there are any other good ones out there. Any suggestions? Just to clarify, I'm mainly looking for stories where both Harry and Ginny are in Slytherin, but a story where just one of them are in Slytherin are good too I guess. I just haven't seen many where they are both in it together.


** Harry Potter and the Syltherin Selection by DrizzleWizzle and its sequels feature a Harry in Syltherin. The pairing isn't clearly defined, but it seems like it's leaning towards Harry/Ginny.

It's not exactly what you're looking for but it's the closest I could think of.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6389117/1/Becoming-Alpha][Becoming Alpha]] is the beginning of a Slytherin!Harry series that ends Harry/Ginny. It's also a pretty good set of reads.
