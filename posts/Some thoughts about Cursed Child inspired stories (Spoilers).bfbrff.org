After learning that Voldemort fathered a child with Bellatrix in Cursed Child, it got me thinking about the realism of such a story. Do you think there is any possibility in fanfic for Voldemort to have a daughter (or son) which could be written realistically? This could have some interesting implications if the child was around Harry's age, but I'm almost certain it would need to be AU to work. What do you guys think?


** You know, I think you've actually got something there. Making Delphini of Harry's generation makes a /lot/ of sense. Her basic concept is reliant on her growing up in a post-Voldemort world where Voldemort still casts a huge shadow; for it to be post-1981 rather than post-1998 is much more appropriate, for thematically, Voldemort is truly over and done with post-/DH/, and Wizarding Britain wants nothing more to do with him. A Delphini who goes to school with Harry & Co., who, perhaps, insinuates herself as their friend, yet is actively trying to /help/ whatever phantoms of himself Voldemort sends to Hogwarts... there's a lot of story possibility in that.

As for whether Lord Voldemort could have fathered a child during the First War... hm. /Hm/. There are several different, not necessarily contradictory schools of interpretation as to why Voldemort agreed to father a child in the regular continuity; one is that it was as a favor to Bellatrix, to keep her happy and compliant, for she could conceive of no higher honor than to bear the Dark Lord's child. Another is that, after the Horcruxing of Nagini went so well, he was taking the next step in his experiments on Horcruxes, and wanted to use his own child as a vessel for part of his soul, essentially creating his own "antichrist" to further his ongoing delusions of godhood.

This latter motive, /Cursed Child/ seemed totally uninterested in (the terminal sin of /Curse Child/ is not that it has bad ideas, don't let the reviews fool you: it is that it has no clue how to execute them).

But a version where Delphini is of Harry's generation would allow it to be developed very interestingly. It would serve as tomato-in-the-mirror when Harry's secret comes out, of course, and Voldemort realizes his great scheme has already been realized without his knowledge in the person of his own archenemy; and Delphini, who dreams of becoming her father's right hand, and does not even consider the possibility that he might not have her best interests at heart, would totally lose her footing when she appears to have won and realize she just screwed herself over massively because Daddy wants to have a Dementor kiss her so he can put part of /his/ soul in place of hers.

Ah, but would First War Voldemort, is the key question, already be experimenting so?

Yes.

We know he went to Godric's Hollow with the intention of using Harry's murder to create his Sixth and last Horcrux; it is often believed that he had already started the ritual when he cast the Killing Curse, and that this is why his soul so readily shattered and Horcruxed Harry in the resulting magical backlash. This latter addition doesn't appear to be quite what Rowling had in mind, but no matter.

The question, however, remains of /what/, if not Harry, Voldemort was intending to make into his last Horcrux.

His sixth intentionally-created Horcrux is, of course, in the canon timelin, Nagini, but we have no record of Nagini being with him in Godric's Hollow, and there are even those who believe Voldemort only met Nagini during his exile in Albania, though I do not give this theory very much credit. But what if Nagini, the Living Horcrux, is a poor man's replacement of his /original/ plan? What if he had brought his daughter, especially fathered through Bellatrix, to Godric's Hollow that day?

Consider this delightful twist on Wrong Boy Who Lived tropes: when Hagrid comes to the wreckage of the Potter cottage, he finds not one baby, but two. The second is a mysterious baby girl of whom no one has heard of...

*** I love your idea about two babies being there! What an interesting concept, especially if Harry and this new baby end up being raised together, the moral dilemma that could then occur if Delphini grows up being close with Harry but then finds out he's the reason her father is dead.

What would be reallyyyy interesting to me is if Voldemort's daughter brought out a different side to him. Does she inspire a fierce over protection as he feels she's an extension of himself? Does she look like Voldemort's mother and trigger some sort of psychological reaction in him? I feel like there is sooo many possibilities for this story if executed properly, especially in an AU story

**** While I like the idea of the child of Voldemort growing up with Harry without knowing his ancestry, there may be some difficulties to explain the futur plot :\\
- The Dursley agred to raise Harry because he was family (and I'm convinced because Dumbledore told them about the protection and how some Death Eater may try to take revenge on his family if it's not there), I doubt they would extend the invitation for a stranger/ child of Petunia's sister killer.\\
- Book Delphini wanted to help Voldemort because she was raised as his "heir" by a fanatical family, so unless you put this revelation really late (like at least Year 4) with a lot of character development before (and a Delphini in Slytherin being less and less close of Harry), I don't see why Delphini would have any problem with Harry (my father is a monster who killed your parents, and then tried to kill you but somehow you survived and he almost died). If anything it would be more Delphini feeling bad and Harry having to confort her.

Still like the idea and would be curious to read it.

***** You're totally right, these would definitely be some plot difficulties in that sense! Although I suppose a complete AU story would be best - the child wouldn't necessarily have to be CC's Delphini either, perhaps. It's an idea I've been toying with for a while :)

** I wrote a Cursed Child inspired fic. It doesn't get much attention but that's beside the point. I will just say that in the play (I shan't discuss the shortcomings of the script here), Delphini claims to be Voldemort's child. We are never shown an iota of evidence that it is true, but everyone believes it without question, even though it makes absolutely no sense.

*** If you're referring to the Sayre theory: I like it, though I like the story possibilities of her as Voldemort's daughter more. But as to how the writers of the play possibly thought their account of things made sense... have this for my two cents: they appear to be laboring under the belief that Voldemort really /was/ the last Parselmouth in the universe, not just in Britain.

Also, if you want your story to get more readership, you might consider linking to it. Cough cough.

**** I dont know what the Sayre theory is but I don't think the explanation I devised has been used by anyone else. I hope not, anyway. I have linked mine in the past but I suspect the fic itself is probably not much to the taste of the sub and these days I'm happy to let it sink into further obscurity.

***** The Sayre theory is the idea that she's descended from Isolt Sayre, the Parselmouth descendant of the Slytherin line who moved to the Americas and participated in the founding of Ilvermorny. The whole Ilvermorny thing (complete with this bit of parseltrivia) was introduced on /Pottermore/ around the same time as /Cursed Child/ was released, leading to much speculation that there was a second shoe yet to drop about Delphini, for which this was the setup. Even after it became apparent that this wasn't the case, the theory remained as a popular fan-explanation.

****** It certainly makes more sense than her being Voldemort's lovechild, considering the man's clearly had less sex than a lettuce.

******* So does my aforedeveloped theory that he sired her as part of some magical ritual, presumably as a future Horcrux vessel (or a body to be possessed in the event of a second death, of course).

I don't think "lovechild" covers it, anyway. Whatever Voldemort's motives, I think it's universally understood that he made love with Bellatrix /once/ for a specific reason, not that Delphini was the eventual result of a long-standing affair.

****** Kinda reminds me of the Darth Jar Jar theory. Maybe they would've gone that direction if the reception towards the Cursed Child was better.

** I've been working on a shortish story (fewer than 10k words) where Delphi is the same age as Teddy and goes to Hogwarts. I think there is a lot of room in the fanfic world for a slightly more normal version of Delphi where she goes to Hogwarts, etc. A fic with her being schoolmates with Harry would be cool to read too.

** I love the idea of Delphini as a character, though I've yet to see much fic with her thus far. I do hope she gets integrated more in various ways. I mean, we as a fandom have done a lot more with characters who had a lot less going for them.

​

I do plan to write a story involving Delphini at some point, but I've got several other in-progress fics to finish before I even think about starting that one.

** I think the James Potter series covers what you're looking for. It's not as much fan fiction as it is another author writing a second series. All I could find when I googled how JK Rowling felt about it, I found this: [[https://www.quora.com/What-does-JK-Rowling-think-of-the-James-Potter-series]]

I read the first 2 and enjoyed them. Not as good quality as HP series but better than most fan fiction I've seen.
