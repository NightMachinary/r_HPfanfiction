I recently discovered a fic where Harry is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7985679/1/To-the-Waters-and-the-Wild][raised by faeries]] and it's lots of fun, and I'm wondering what other fictions are out there where he's raised in the wild/by snakes/faeries/etc.? I love the idea of a Harry with a completely different viewpoint than canon once he hits Hogwarts. I don't really care about pairings if the story is good.


** Krahae's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5001827/1/Grimm-A-Fairy-s-Tale][Grimm: A Fairy Tale]] has Harry raised to be an Unseelie. 94k words, complete.

  Pre-Hogwarts. The stuff of legends, myth and majesty were the realm of the Fey long before wizards named him Boy Who Lived. Maeve of the Unseelie Court has decided to take one of wizarding kind's myths, to shape as her own. Vastly AU.

This is a really long Harry ends up being a mystical elf saga, along with Draco shipping, and evil Dursleys and evil Dumblodore. Harry's viewpoint on life changes as the story develops but it's a year uhh seven story.

  While flying back from Godric's Hollow, Hagrid accidentally drops baby Harry over a wild forest. Harry is raised by rebel fairies until his Hogwarts letter arrives. The Dark Lord is in for a surprise... HP/LV romance. SLASH.
