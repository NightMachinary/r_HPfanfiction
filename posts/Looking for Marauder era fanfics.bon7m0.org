  "I read the book," he says. "Peter Pan. Took me all summer. And I've figured out why you're always so uptight and miserable: it's because you're trying so hard to be this Wendy character." / For Safari. (Sorry for cheating.)

** I honestly haven't found any that do a good biopic of his life as well. When I come across child Severus stories, I usually find that they tend to glorify trauma rather than ask questions and provide character arc. Or it just devolves into romance with whomever the character is- though I did enjoy Pride of Time by Anubis Ankh : [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7453087/1/]]

Childhood stops at Chapter 12, however.

I did read a time travel one once, I think Lily and he had like a secret library office? I can't remember the name.

  It's 1975 and Whoever-He-Is has turned his eyes towards Hogwarts. Muggle-born Lily Evans is certain her best friend has been recruited by the Death Eaters. She's less certain about her future in Wizarding Britain. And she has absolutely no idea how to handle the dark-haired, outrageously privileged, obnoxiously talented toerag named James Potter. A canon-compliant account of the first Wizarding War and the teenagers who fought in it.

** Canon compilant life of SS (includes, but not limited to Marauder-era), brief SS/OFC: linkffn(A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles)

Some people at the right place at the right time avert SS' descent into darkness, preventing canon disasters, LESS: linkffn(If Someone Cared Enough)

SS gets to redo his life starting after his regrettable action that resulted in the rest of his life in misery, LESS: linkffn(The Peace Not Promised)

HG accidentally travels back in time to Marauder-era, giving SS a second chance at love, SSHG: linkffn(Pride of Time)

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

  What if Snape had received some better guidance when he was young from people who cared enough to notice what he was going through and looked deeper than the surface? What if there had been Slytherins who weren't aspiring Death Eaters? Would their assistance be enough to help a few young and hot tempered teens? (Slow burn romance)

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.

  Hermione quite literally crashes her way back through time by roughly twenty years. There is no going back; the only way is to go forward. And when one unwittingly interferes with time, what one expects may not be what time finds...

here's mine: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13222016/1/Severus-Snape-and-the-Art-of-War]] (It's also on AO3 under the same username if you prefer that platform).

Snape's the main character. No character bashing involved.
