When I was reading Deathly Hallows, one conversation in particular caught my attention. Griphook and Ron are sniping at each other and, if I remember correctly, Griphook is mad at wizards because they refuse to share the secrets of wandlore, and Ron counters that goblins don't share how they make their magical items, so they don't have any right to complain.

This blew my mind.

The idea that goblins could actually use wands and cast spells was, and still is, to me, pretty damn significant, since nobody seems to be exploring it. Wizards aren't on top because their magic is innately more useful; it's all because they just happened to have invented wands first. It's all just magic. You either have it or you don't, but individual species don't have unique magic; goblins, apparently, could learn to use wands, and wizards could learn to make overpowered magic swords.

Does that mean that wizards could learn centaur divination? Or have they already done that, and are just really bad at it, for the same reason that goblins haven't just picked up a wand and learned how to make their own; reverse engineering magic is apparently really hard?

Are there any fics that actually explore any of these questions? That one conversation from canon could be interpreted to mean HP takes place in a world where all magic- goblin, merperson, centaur, wizard, even house elf!- is all learnable, and yet I can't remember encountering a fic where this was even ever mentioned.

Even fics where someone just earns some magic from a different magical species would do, even if it's not the focus of the story.

That they definitely could. And do. I am of a mind that what mangled little wizardkind knows of Divination, they learned from Centaurs long ago, in times before the two species became enemies. And we see Firenze teaching his lore as Divination Professor, do we not?

As to your main request, there are actually a fair few stories where Harry learns House-Elf popping, like linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them). And in my story linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindors) a secondary plotline concerns Alizors trying to get wands and learn wizard magic, and I have a Boggart who, after gaining sentience, convincingly builds himself a student persona and attends Hogwarts in earnest.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth. She arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... oh Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this.

** I remember reading a Harry learning House-elf Apparition - that is Apparating even inside or outside buildings that have Anti-Apparition enchantments on them in linkffn(Innocent by Marauderlover7)

Though I liked Innocent when I first read it, by the time I was finished with it, I lost interest to continue to the sequels. I know lots of people like the entire series which is still ongoing, but I'm too lazy for super-long fanfics.

** This is an older thread and I have little to contribute besides saying that my story, linkffn(The Coven of Albion), will in two chapters have goblins attending Hogwarts. Also, in canon we know other species can use wands. There's a series of laws that forbids them, however. In fact, in Goblet of Fire remember how everyone initially thought Winky cast the Dark Mark? It's because any magical being can use wands. None of the wizards thought her being a house-elf was the issue, the only drawback was them not being certain where she could have picked up the spell itself (only Death Eaters ever knew the spell).
