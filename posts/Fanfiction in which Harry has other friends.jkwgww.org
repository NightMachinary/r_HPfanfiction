Hello! I'm looking for fics in which Harry has close friends outside Ron and Hermione. I don't mind if he is friends with the two also though. It could be anyone from any age and from any houses. Pairings are fine but would really prefer that it is not the major point of the fic. No evil, dark and murder-y Harry please.


** Linkffn(A New Better Life by Ulltima101) It's my own story, first year is wrapping up and hes already made friends with at least 2 other people, more will come as I continue

  A re-imagining of Harry's life where he applies himself a little bit more, works a little harder, and gets closer to more people than just Ron and Hermione. Smartish!Harry, Grey!Harry, (multiple normal relationships Harry ) Good!Dumbledore, Rival!Draco. Adult content later

** Harry is a dragon and that's ok

Outside the obvious part about him being a Dragon, there is no 'golden trio' - they're good friends with Neville and Dean (the closest ones), have quite some relation going with the Twins and Ginny, and also Percy - tbh this fic has got the best portrayal of him i've ever seen.

Then there is some ongoing friendship with some fellows from slytherin and a bunch of technically human OCs, but those aren't as thick.

  After McGonagall's dismissal of the first divination lesson Harry decides to change elective. In the process Harry starts to understand that he can do things without Ron or Hermione and that their yearmates are worth getting to know. A different take on PoA and on. Rating's for safety. Not a Ron/Hermione bashing story.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!
