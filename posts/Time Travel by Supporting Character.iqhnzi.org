So I've read more fics than I can count with the basic time travel premise - the war against Voldemort went catastrophically wrong and the only hope is a time travel redo.

Usually the time traveler is a main character - plenty with Harry, Hermione, Ron, Snape, Sirius, etc.

What I'm hoping for are some fics that twist the trope a bit by making the time traveler ( to use a chess metaphor for Ron) a pawn instead of a queen. Maybe Tonks, Mundungous Fletcher, Flitwick, an older Neville, something like that.

Has anyone come across anything like this? I generally prefer longer (or at least ongoing) stories but open to one-shots as well. Thanks!


** If you google ‚ÄúTonks time travel FanFiction‚Äù there are some about her traveling. I've never read them because she never was my cup of tea.

Can you imagine Mad Eye traveling back? Shit would get done. üòÇüòÇ

** I'm actually in the process of writing a mad eye and Harry go back in time, it's kind of odd trying to write mad eye because we don't actually get to see too much of him in the books or movies. But basically the war with Voldemort goes on for a little bit longer, enough that mad eye eventually starts to train Harry in all he knows, Harry as a result is more paranoid, cynical, non trustworthy, and a plethora of other things. It features a kind of John Wick /James Bond /Jack Reacher kind of Harry, but with some John Constantine sarcastic humour and a bit of general paranoia. Harry and mad eye are friends but there's a lot of inside jokes no one else gets in the story. I'll be releasing it withing the next month, as soon as I get a title and a couple chapters.

#+begin_quote
  After her husband is unfaithful and her cookie-cutter perfect world is turned on its head, Petunia Evans Dursley finds herself in her old hometown, full of regrets and feeling that her life has been without purpose. Before she can quietly take her own life, she is given an impossible offer by a long-dead figure from the magical world: return to the past, and rewrite her own history. Seeing it as a chance to make up for her biggest regret, Petunia accepts and finds herself in the middle of a Wizarding war she knew little about, protecting the younger sister she tried to forget by seeking help from the one person in the magical world she knows how to find.A what-if story beginning in the latter years of the first war against Voldemort, where an unlikely alliance turns into an even more unlikely romance, and the bonds that bloom from it will change the course of Wizarding history.

** To expand on that, I'd be curious for fics where the time traveler assumes a role in the past that already exists, because they realize that person was always them. It's hard to explain, but for example I read a fic once where an adult Hermione goes back, meets Regulus, and at some point she notices the Standard books of spells for all the years aren't announced at the bookstore, she realizes that she knows them almost by heart so she writes them, and uses the pseudonym of the original author, who has in fact always been her. Not sure if it was in this one or not but I also remember one where she's the astronomy or arithmancy professor, can't remember which, using the known fake name (Vector/Sinistra), because that person doesn't actually exists and it was her all along. I think that's a pretty clever way to move the plot along, explain some time-travel stuff, and create some very funny situations !

  Lavender takes one step forward and -- just like the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the drop of a pebble -- Hogwarts is left behind. There's no jump, no flashes of light, no whirlwinds of disconnected images. Just one little step; behind stood her war and in front stands 1947. "Huh," she says to herself, "didn't see this in the tea leaves."

** I'm currently writing a time travel Fanfic on Wattpad; Neville Longbottom and the Journey through time. It's about the 'What if Harry Potter died and Voldemort won'. McGonagall find a file in Dumbledores office containing a way for Neville to time travel back to the mauraders era and change history. The eventual pairing will be SiriusB X NevilleL.

I've also started to read some Regulus Black time travel lately, so that's been interesting to say the least.
