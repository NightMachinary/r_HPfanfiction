Specifically looking for the fic that has Harry fidelius out the unforgivables' incantations, and uses veritaserum to unlock knowledge that is subconsciously known (because he was being dosed by Tonks for some reason?)

Edit: Apparently I was thinking of two different fics. The first was Honestly, Harry!, which shows the abuse of the fidelius charm and portkeys. The other I am still looking for.

Edit 2: And the other was Veritas Oracle. Only took /entirely too long/ to work out what the two of them were.

Any other fics of similar nature would be awesome as well.

** Well one could say use metamorph(Thought it isn't fanon) abilities to heal any wound. Then there is also the idea of using a notice-me-not charm on something you want to see through, because if its making so people don't see something the things behind it will be visible. Then using a notice-me-not charm on your wand, or someones clothes, or the fire thats burning there house down.

*** Surely a 'Notice-me-not' charm would just make people stop looking there, rather than let them see what's behind it? I always imagined it working a bit like a big 'nothing to see here' sticker covering whatever you put it on, and then people just don't look.

*** Good thing that notice-me-not isn't a canon spell!

#+begin_quote
  A series of Vignettes involving possibly the second most powerful but underused magic in the HP universe, Veritaserum. AU after GOF. Rating increased to T due to a bit of implied sexual situations, attempted suicide, abuse, and other nasty stuff.
