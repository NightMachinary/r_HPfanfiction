That's the main conflict I'm looking for. I haven't been able to find many, and the ones in which I do find - either voldmort starts the war and wizards are wiped out, or the muggles discover them accidentally and the war wipes both sides of the fight out. Time travel is OK as long as its well written. Thank you!


** linkffn(Rise of the Wizards by Teufel1987) has this sort of conflict, but the outcome isn't quite what you're after.

linkffn(Emperor by Marquis Black) is another with magic and mundane worlds clashing.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** linkffn(The Voyage of the Starship Hedwig) is a post-DH fic where muggles strike first and eliminate almost all the wizards. The last of them escape in a spaceship. It kind of fits your requirements, in that wizard/muggle conflict is central to the story, but there is also a lot of wizard/wizard conflict afterwards.
