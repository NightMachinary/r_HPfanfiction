**** The plot actually flows really well (even across 3m words which is no easy feat) and the conflict is meaningful. As it progresses it gets darker, and feels real. The pacing is very well done as well; everything has its place. The phoenix web mechanics were awesome; rather than just bashing. Lucius as a character really shined in this fic as well. Draco is a real character that grows and manages to stand on his own; even away from his father.

This fic does show its age (over a decade old) but is a must read for the fandom in my opinion. At the very least it is a well written complete work that does something truly unique. A very solid AU.

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*
