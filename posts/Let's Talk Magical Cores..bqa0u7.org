JKR straddles the line between modern and mystical fantasy by having magic portrayed simultaneously as an intelligible skill that one can learn and even quantify scientifically (Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration and the 5 principal exceptions) and as a mysterious force of great power that is not to be truly understood (love).

The former has the benefit of grounding suspension of disbelief and establishing strategy and stakes in confrontations, since we as an audience have a reasonable idea of what characters are capable of, how they might stack up against one another, and when they may be in trouble. This greater understanding can also flesh out world building as the consequences of abilities and their limitations ripple through how society is structured and power dynamics between different groups with different abilities emerge. As a potential downside limiting what the characters can and can't do creates limitations for the author, which might be irritating if you have a cool idea that shouldn't be possible by your own rules.

On the other hand the latter style of magic harnesses the lack of understanding to create a sense of wonder and awe. It can be used for asspulls (because magic) or an author can deliberately structure a story so there are only a handful of magic users who are absent in crucial moments of struggle during crucial struggles in the plot ( /cough/ Gandalf /cough/).

Rowling has her cake and eats it too because while the whole premise of a magical school suggests modern logic applies the vast majority of lesson content does not make it into the narrative and we have a very limited understanding of magic ( possibly because Harry seems more inclined to practical magic than theory, possibly because few magical mechanics are plot relevant.) Other than knowing that laws exist, that people cannot truly be brought back from the dead, that love cannot truly be magically created, and that food cannot be conjured from thin air (...though animals that can be cooked can... and wine which has calories can... and food can be multiplied out of thin air if you have other food as a template... because /fuck/ consistency), we don't know what those laws are.

This has led fan authors to try and create their own rules, the most ubiquitous of which seems to be the 'magical core' - which explains why some people have magic while others don't, potential differences in power between magic users and a reason why a witch or a wizard might tire in a duel - all of which are hinted at in canon while never made explicit or given an explanation. While I admire the attempt sometimes a magical core is just associated with a number that without much context is remarked to be higher than typical, and that's that.

So, in order to try and optimize this system, I'd like to brainstorm. What are some ways you've seen this done poorly, or done well? How do you typically handle such material if you do? And what are the strengths and weakness of this kind of approach as to other magical power scaling systems?


** Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches probably has the best magical core system I've seen. The magical core is a part of the body that converts "wild magic" into "ready magic", which is used for casting spells. The act of converting magic produces a magical toxin, and high toxin levels are the cause of magical exhaustion.

** I dislike magical cores because of how they impoverish magic. They replace something that is a complex combination of personality, experience, knowledge, intelligence, values, and plain old hard work---things integral to the character---with a single arbitrary Power Meter.

Notice how canon doesn't have characters who are unintelligent and weak-willed yet powerful, nor does it have those who are wilful and intelligent yet are almost squibs. Instead, canon has Lockhart---the character most obsessed with how others perceive him---whose magic gives him effective and precise Memory Charms, but fails him in other ways; and Harry, for whom "wearing his emotions on his sleeve" gives him a powerful Patronus, while crippling his Occlumency.

*** A bit of a tangent but I've always strongly disagreed with this characterization of Harry. Harry hates talking about his emotions and generally prefers to play things close to the chest - he doesn't like attention and generally keeps a few close friends rather than a larger more disparate circle, and even then he doesn't feel fully comfortable confiding in them or expressing his emotions outside of situations where he's completely emotionally overwhelmed- he's got a hell of a temper but he's more of a 'simmer silently until everything explodes out at once' kind of guy. Plus he spent a decade living with the Dursleys where he often had to keep his thoughts and feelings under wraps because he'd be punished otherwise.

There's actually some sign that people knowing his innermost thoughts and emotions might actually be his berserk button, since in OoTP Dudley bringing up his nightmare about Cedric is what provokes him to whip out his wand, Snape reading his thoughts makes him utterly miserable and Dumbledore consoling him about his grief over Sirius causes him to violently trash the Headmasters office.

The 'wears his emotions on his sleeve' trope is basically the *opposite* of who Harry is and I dislike this being presented as gospel.

**** We should be careful not to get into pop-psychology, but I think that there is a big difference between talking about emotions and experiencing them. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the people most willing to talk about their emotions would also be the best at hiding their emotions when needed, and vice versa.

Just because Harry doesn't like other people knowing his feelings doesn't mean his feelings aren't obvious to other people. That is, when Harry simmers silently, everyone around him can tell that he is simmering silently. That's what "emotions on his sleeve" means.

** In my opinion Magical cores are stupid. But I do buy into spells of varying strength tied to the individual and the wand. A first year student will not cast a spell with the same effect as a 7th year.

Magical exhaustion is also a stupid plot device. There's no set limit of magic and if a person wants to cast a spell repeatedly then they can. It's not about speed but finesse really in canon.

** I believe that finite magical cores are a terrible idea. In canon, magical exhaustion is never a thing (that said, regular old exhaustion shows up plenty). The closest thing to fanon magical exhaustion we see is in POA where Harry practices the Patronus, and can only try the spell a couple of times before Lupin stops him.

This isn't so much Harry being exhausted from using magic as it is being exposed repeatedly to a Dementor, even if it is just a Boggart playing charades. A true Dementor put Harry in the Hospital wing for several hours (the train), I imagine the Boggart exhausted him quite efficiently even with its weaker effect.

That said, I do believe (in my own personal headcanon mind you) that a metaphysical connection to magic does exist connected to a wizard's soul. This connection could be called a 'core'. It is, however, merely a bridge. It cannot be exhausted, but some people have larger bridges than others and so can draw more power into their spells than other people. As bridges can be blocked, so can a wizard's 'core' close to birth if they are abnormally powerful, to prevent tons of accidental magic from happening constantly. After infancy it is exceedingly difficult to bind a core and requires significant power (or multiple casters).

I quite like my own headcanon because it gives you something to call a wizard's connection to magic while still obeying canon (and avoiding all the 'magical exhaustion' bullshit). And just because some people have more power than others does not mean that everyone's connection is not similar size.

I believe Rahkeesh put it best in 'A Long Journey Home'.

** 'Magical cores' are interesting when, for example, there is:

- An interesting underlying system for how magic works, that magical cores fit into

- Some kind of limitation that is plot-useful or interesting.

When they're used as a mcguffin, they're kind of pointless. For example "X has a really big magical core, so X is more powerful" without worldbuilding or plot to make that mean something, is just "X is more powerful" with some extraneous words tacked on.

For example, you could have something like Core Threads, where magic is basically from the soul, and the difference between magicals and mundanes is that magicals' souls are soft and malleable, whereas mundanes are hard and brittle. 'Magical cores' don't even explicitly exist, but souls are basically them, and the properties and mechanisms thereof are the source of the entire story

Similarly, in NOFP There is a 'corpus magus', which is strongly implied is both the soul and the source of one's magic. Here, it is only very briefly mentioned, and the thing that brings it up has two interesting effects a bonus (more powerful spellcasting) and a limitation - less control and even an inability to use certain magics

** For me, a magic system (whether in Harry Potter fanfiction or original fiction) must possess these characteristics:

1. Magic must be useful. It should solve the material concerns of non-magical life. Magic can introduce its own, novel concerns, but it should not be the case that the only real purpose of magic is to fight other wizards.

2. Magic should be capable of being used frivolously. This ties into the "useful" point - it undermines the usefulness of magic for solving the problems of everyday life if magic needs to be conserved in some sense. Wizards should be able to consistently rely on magic 24/7 as the basis on which they live their lives.

3. Magic should /not/ fundamentally alter the human experience. While it should be capable of solving the material concerns of non-magical people, it should not be able to easily solve interpersonal or social concerns such as the need to trust, the possibility of betrayal, the feasibility of dishonesty, and inequality between individuals.

4. Wizards should not be able to lose access to their powers, temporarily or permanently. This includes "magical exhaustion" and variants thereof. I am in a fantasy world for "I wish I was a wizard" escapism. Making wizards capable of losing their powers ruins that escapism.

5. Magic should operate in such a way as to suspend/override/contradict the laws of nature as we understand them in real life. It should not be an unknown part of the natural world but rather supernatural - a completely separate system (whether that is the "magic is cheat codes" approach or the "universe is fundamentally magical and physics is wrong" approach). Most importantly, it should not be possible to perform some kind of conversion between physical energy and magical power such that one can say that X amount of physical energy would be able to overcome Y piece of magic. Magic should not be capable of being overcome by non-magic. Again, this undermines the escapism.

6. However, magic should not be a simple case of "wish for things and they happen". Magic should be rule bound and lawful, with complex bodies of (non-scientific, non-mathematical) knowledge underlying how it operates. Magic does have limits but they are the limits determined by magical law, not by a failure to overcome physical law. Magic which was just a case of wishing for things would be too easy and would fail to produce inequality between wizards - see point 7.

7. Magic should be difficult, and mastery of it should consist of obtaining a significant amount of complex knowledge and understanding. While there is ample room for natural talent, this should consist of character traits which result in understanding magic more readily and to a deeper level. It should be impossible for there to be a "powerful brute"; when it comes to magic, the nerds should rule the world. This achieves three things: it makes the system morally satisfying, as power is connected to merit; it produces a wide range of inequality of magical ability between wizards; and it makes high-achieving wizards as worthy of intellectual respect as high-achieving non-wizards.

In all of the above, the word "wizards" should be read broadly, as "individuals with special powers". For example, I'm equally disinterested in a de-powered Superman as I am a magically exhausted wizard.

If I encountered a story which featured magical cores and which satisfied the above requirements, I would be perfectly happy to read it. But almost all magical core stories breach 2, 4, and 5. Most magical core stories also end up breaching 6 and 7.

Its canon that wizards can temporarily loose acess to their powers if they are emotionally distressed. Merope or Tonks for example.

Otherwise I agree, fics where using magic only requires wanting something hard enough and having enough mana or where the only thing they learn are incarnations and wand movements, make me really wonder why Hogwarts would even be necessary if magic were that easy.

***** I am not sure about that, yes you cant create good food, yet even poor wizards dont seem to consider food as a material concern or as something they have to struggle to get. Ron was the poorest of his friends but as the one with least experience in a non magical environment, it was him who struggled the most with the lack of food. Or how both Harry and Dumbledore agree that if Merope had acess to her powers she would have been able to aquire food. The trio in the forest was the only situation whre we saw capable wizards struggling with food, but they were in the rather unique situation where none of them could cook and they were forced to avoid attention. And even then it was quality of food they struggled with, not availability.

*** I see your point and agree to some extent. However, I am disinterested in an overpowered Superman as I would be one with no powers. The desire for escapism and awesome has to be balanced with the desire for tension and narrative stakes. If a character can do virtually anything with ease at any point in the story there isn't any real drama unless it's derived from a conflict from point 3.

The success of something like One Punch Man is entirely based on the disappointment and boredom of being ludicrously powerful by displacing those emotions onto the overpowered protagonist for emotional connection and comedic effect- it's where most of the jokes come from and also one of the central motives of the hero come from and most dramatic moments are either non-physical unfair treatment of Saitama or match ups of lesser heroes against danger. Played straight unfettered wish fulfillment becomes tiresome.

I think the Inheritance Cycle put forward a Magic System a bit more restrictive than most that I remain fond of for its quantification. Any action performed by magic takes the same amount of energy as it would to do the task mundanely ( levitating a stone takes the same amount of energy as lifting it). Magic remains useful in tasks which are impossible by mundane means but not due to energy cost, and is substantially buffed by being able to store unused energy in a gemstone for later use and draw on the energy of other creatures, but it still has very clear limitations.

Obviously magic in the Potterverse has a much lower energy cost if it has one at all and Wizards are capable of extraordinary feats that would tire anyone using typical strength, but having some limits makes a good deal of sense.

I tend to prefer my fantasy on the more reserved and restricted side, personally.

**** Being overpowered isn't really a problem in this case because the enemies also have acess to those powers. Superman being able to destroy planets isn't a problem if he faces Zodd or Darkseid who are also able to do that but are also willing to be more ruthless or skilled with their powers. It only becomes a problem. If you have his enemy be someone who is much less powerful than him, but the answer to that is not to nerf superman, but to give him better enemies.

Likewise Harry having access to overpowered magic isn't a problem if Voldemort has the same magic but also more much more skill and willingness to commit evil deeds, and it only becomes a problem if his main enemies are muggles(without access to magical allies) but if you want that you either have to make it extremely AU or pick a different fandom.

For a wizard in Harry Potter to struggle with an enemy he has to have access to magic. Scrimgeour says it best.

** Re: food. I think that's about dead cells not being creatable because they are complex structures composed of many different molecules arranged in a certain pattern, and the wizard doesnt have a template.

Avis is a charm, and it conjures birds temporarily.

Serpensortia /summons/ a snake, like teleportation. Disapparation is a thing (and so is the apparently different house elf popping), divination - and things like the point me spell - exist (And if point me tells direction, and there should also be a spell for distance, and the two together can find the nearest serpent)

Wine has carbs, which is an organic molecule, yes, which is NOT in a specific patteen, only proportion, which divination can be used to find (or honestly encoded into the spell itself like the avis spell has the structure of birds in it.

Honestly, I find the abilty to turn a desk into a pig waaaaaaaay more surprising, but that indicates the transfiguration spell has divination encoded into it - 12 year olds learn to transfigure a needle after all, and they don't know about atoms, cells and stuff, and certainly not the structure of a wood cell, which makes up the needle....

On the one hand, alchemy is real in the HP universe, which would indicate "no".

On the other hand, JKR has referred to molecules in interview responses regarding transfiguration, so she clearly has written HP with that assumption in mind.

She probably hasn't put her mind to the contradiction there - while JKR is very well read on alchemy, the way she deploys that knowledge is to build alchemical themes into the narrative. As we know from population numbers etc. she is not the type of worldbuilder who considers factual contradiction a particular problem.

** I can see where the appeal comes from. You need some way to determine who is stronger, and it's easier to do so with a Dragonball Z style "power level" metric. Bonus points if you can actually quantify someone's core. "No,you fool! Don't duel Potter, his core is over 9000!" and other such nonsense.

In my headcanon magic is like a muscle, the more you use it, the more you "work out" with magic the stronger it gets. That's why mild mannered shopkeepers and house wives are so weak compared to power houses like Dumbledore and Voldemort, hell even the average Auror is far deadlier with a wand than them. And it's not just the spells he knows. Anyone can learn a spell given enough time, but if your magic "muscle" is weak from underuse then casting a spell that is even moderately taxing would just tire you out, like running a mile after a year of being a couch potato.

Another way to put it is to imagine a roaring river, that river is magic. Magic has currents that diverge from the stream, and those are witches and wizards. Some magicials have wider "openings" to their streams than others, whether through genetics, sheer hard work and practice or both.

1) the strength of your soul to conjure the necessary energy

2) the sturdiness of your body to resist the backlash of altering reality

3) the knowledge of your mind to bring forth the desired change

​

there would be of course ways to play around those, for example a wizard like Dumbledore that doesn't have a sturdy body, can have enough knowledge to make his magic extremely efficient or a wizard like Harry that doesn't have enough knowledge but has a lot of willpower can brute force his way in doing something like repealing 100 dementors

** I find Magical Cores stupid in a Harry Potter universe (especially considering how a lot of author use it : "Harry have a big magical core, so Harry is already more powerfull than adults when he reach 1st year).

As for Magical Exhaustion, I consider it doesn't exist as such. For me, doing magic is like doing math on how you have to focus on your spell and the effects of it. 1st year spell are simple arithmetic, a bit hard when you are a child, but laughable for adults. Later, spells become more difficult and can be comparable to harder equations. I don't think "Magic" is something finite, but I consider that after several hours using spells, a wizard would start to be tired and have a headache, making spells harder and harder to use unitl he finally rest.

** Regarding Magical Cores, they can be used perfectly fine, if the general magical system is more fleshed out and they are more than just a number to compare.

There are several excellent fics which use the concept like the Pureblood Pretense and its sequels. As long as you give the concept meaning and tie it into your story, there is no reason to not include it in your fic.

To answer your actual questions, I believe that they are typically better utilized in more rigid and scientific magic and world systems. In these settings, they will usually have a function beyond just making clear character X is powerful and can often be used very well as a plot device, i.e., maturation at a certain point in time, biological tie-ins, manifestation of different affinities.

The other way to use them is obviously subversion of the trope, in which case you include them but make them useless. For example, I remember reading a fic in which everyone had a magical core of the same size and what set people apart was their will and desire to express it.

In the end, Magical Cores are a trope like any other and can enrich a story by their presence as well as subtract from it. The latter case often appears to be lazy, whilst the former requires a more unique take on the trope with greater implications to the general story.
