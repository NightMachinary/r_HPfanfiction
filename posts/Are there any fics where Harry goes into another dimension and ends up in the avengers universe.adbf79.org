** A few dozens, if not more. Now, if you are looking for good fics, that narrows it down plenty. I'd suggest "Wand and Shield". It starts out great though I think the writer was a bit fatigued by the end.

  After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Encompasses MCU movies & TV, some others along the way.

** linkffn(8177168) linkffn(10477045) There are couple more readable but too short and abandoned stories if you are desperate. Sadly things have been pretty stale when it comes to this crossover for some time now. That is of course assuming like myself you don't like fem!harry, slash, marvel character(s) is/are father/mother or child of Harry and generally Harry Potter world and Avengers world were one and the same all along kind of crossovers.

  The world is breaking. War and technology push on the edge of the unbelievable as S.H.I.E.L.D. desperately tries to keep the peace. Soldier and scientist no longer hold the line alone, as an ancient fire burns alongside them. The last of all wizards.

  Harry becomes disillusioned with his world after defeating Voldemort and decides to go traveling, ending up in another dimension that's similar but not quite the same as his original one. He makes friends with the Avengers.

  Rescued from the Negative Zone by the Fantastic Four, Harry Potter discovers he is a mutant and decides to take up the cause of equality between mutants and humans (among other causes). How will a dimensionally displaced Harry Potter, one who is extremely intelligent, proactive and not afraid to get his hands dirty effect the marvel universe? Pairings: Harry/Jean/Ororo/others pos.
