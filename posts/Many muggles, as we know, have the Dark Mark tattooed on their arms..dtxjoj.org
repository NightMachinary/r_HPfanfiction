One day, the tattoo starts burning and moving.

He has come back.

And the muggles with the tattoo are bound to him as Death Eaters.

** Truthfully? I think people would be overjoyed that their fantasy world is, in fact, real. They would see it as divine providence or something. Some would revolt and get killed but the rest, majority, would probably revel in the fact that magic is real and that they can be a small part of it.

I sense a mugglebrorn registration office, headed by muggles of all things, as a permanent institution under the new world regime.

EDIT: Also Voldemort is laughing his ass off how silly muggles are and how that totally untruthful series written by the Joanne woman got everyone so excited.

***** Honestly, I little disjointed. There's at least 13 new characters that seem important. But it's too many to give each one any real characterizations, and because of that, I'm having a hard time keeping track of who is who.

If inverarity can simplify things pretty soon, that may help with the focus, but it seems like they may be losing their groove. There's just too much on the back burner. I'm looking forward to being proven wrong, though.

Oh, yeah, and I also can't tell what plot points are important anymore. Some things happen that /should/ be utterly world changing for a 15-year-old kid, as well as for a wizard, that seem to simply happen, and then get more or less forgotten about.

***** The difference between Dumbledore/Voldemort and other wizards is skill and knowledge. They're both ridiculously brilliant people who dedicated their lives to the pursuit of knowledge (though for very different reasons). It's like comparing someone who works at CERN to someone who took physics in high-school a decade ago. Except the physics in this case is magic, and high-school was their NEWTs.

******* Not unlimited. I figure casting magic takes work, which means you're going to tire eventually (just like doing anything is going to cause fatigue eventually) but I've always thought that would be down to the frailties of the human body rather than any 'magical core'. A magical core is just a way of artificially imposing a quantifiable level of power onto characters at best, or imposing a video game like mechanic at worst. The thing about magic in HP, it's not particularly quantifiable, which is what adds to the whimsy.

Also, there's absolutely nothing in canon that indicates any one wizard has 'more' or 'less' magic than anyone else. It all comes down to aptitude and hard work. Like people who are good with numbers excelling at math if they put the effort in. Same thing could apply to transfiguration or charms.

******** Canon was unclear about many things. But you're proposing that something was same in every person, which was not possible as every person was born different. We have heridatory traits like Parseltongue and there was no explanation about how muggleborns got their magic and why squibs born with no magic. How Tonks got her metamorphmagus skill? How wand chooses the wizard? Was it power or character or both? Why one's wand won't work for others? It may not be magical core but it can be someone's affinity with magic. Maybe some people can channel magic easily through them like young riddle in his early life in orphanage.

********* I'm fairly certain that it's canon that every wizard and witch could theoretically become Merlin if they were smart and dedicated enough. The moment you have magic you have the same potential as everyone else. At least the same way that every person could theoretically get a PhD in Math or Physics.

Talents like Parselmouth or Metamorphmagus are inherited but it's not unreasonable to say that some wizard made up some sort of brilliant ritual that gave him this power and bound it to his bloodline. That's how it works in many other settings and there's nothing to say that it's not the same here.

The wand chooses could easily choose based on character. And it would fit the theme if they carried over some sort of magical imprint from the creature that they have as a core. Some are inherently more loyal, others more violent but also more suited for certain fields of magic etc. and that influences the wand.

Riddle was simply a genius who realized that he had magic and focused almost solely on developing those talents because he had nothing else and wanted to be special.

There is absolutely nothing in Harry Potter that needs people to have some sort of limiter in their magic. My personal headcanon was always that suggests there are different inherent power levels between people. In fact, the whole way that the bad guys advocate an obviously wrong "some people are better than others" ideology without ever showing any evidence suggests that it's not the case for her.
