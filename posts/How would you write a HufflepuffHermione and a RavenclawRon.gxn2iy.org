** I can easily see Hermione as a Hufflepuff - her study schedules show an intense work ethic. In 3rd year she signed up for more schoolwork than can fit in a 24 hour day. Her dedication to the rules and /pro forma/ respect for teachers also strikes me as Hufflepuffian, loyalty to an ideal of fairness. She stayed loyal to Harry during the Triwizard Tournament and the horcrux hunt. At Christmas in POA, turning in the Firebolt took courage, yes, but also the desire to place her friend's well-being over her own comfort.

Ron as a Ravenclaw is harder to see but I think it could be made to work. Not all Ravenclaws have to fit the bookworm stereotype. Lockhart, Luna, Cho, Marietta - none of them are described as particularly bookish. Ron's good at chess, which is a specific subtype of intelligence. I vaguely recall him having a head for trivia, too, e.g. chocolate frog cards and Chudley Cannon statistics.

Hufflepuff could be good for Hermione. She'd probably click better with Susan and Hannah than Lavender and Parvati. The Puffs are more likely to appreciate her buckle-down-and-get-working tutoring than the house of the reckless, and those Puffs with social skills could teach her to sand down her rough edges.

Ravenclaw could be good for Ron, too. Especially if he got on the Quidditch team, because I'm sure they have a policy of replacing members who can't balance sports and grades. He could build friendships based on a shared love of chess and Quidditch strategy. He'd be immersed in a culture where doing homework and studying for tests was a normal part of the daily routine. It would also give him something to distinguish himself from his brothers. And I could see Ron /wanting/ to study more and live up to that Ravenclaw stereotype in order to be "the smart one" in his family.

*** You make some really good points! Wow I'd never thought of Hufflepuff Hermione before but now I rather want to read a fic like that. The thought of her helping her classmates academically and being helped socially in return is so wholesome.

** I don't think you'd have to change all that much. For Ravenclaw the traits (according to the HP Wiki page) are:

- Intelligence
- Wit
- Wisdom
- Creativity
- Originality
- Individuality
- Sharpness
- Acceptance

Ron is quite intelligent. His chess ability proves that. Wit - obviously. He's very witty. I don't think we see much of his creativity, but he must be original to support a team like the Chudley Cannons that few others support, and stand by it despite everything other people say, and to paint his room bright orange. Nowhere does it say that a Ravenclaw has to be bookish and studious (this stereotype annoys me so much!). And acceptance; for purebloods, I'd say the Weasleys are of the more accepting families in Wizarding Britain.

For Hufflepuff the traits are:

- Diligence
- Dedication
- Fairness
- Patience
- Kindness
- Tolerance
- Modesty
- Loyalty

For Hermione I'd say that the only traits I'd question would be kindness, tolerance and modesty. She's kind, of course, but moments like that with Lavender and her dead bunny sort of doesn't support it, but then again, she means well in situations like SPEW. She also shows low tolerance for Luna (though she grows more accepting eventually) and to "untraditional" types of magic (Trelawney and Divination), and she does no attemt to show any modesty about her academic talents, and wants to show her ability, even when she isn't supposed to (eg. wanting to answer when Snape directly asks Harry questions in their first Potions class). Also, I am not exactly sure how patient she would be.

But I think that you could make both characters fit with some adjustments - Hermione perhaps more so for Hufflepuff than Ron for Ravenclaw. I think most people would have traits from all the houses, but some are more prevalent than others.

*** "His chess ability proves that" ðŸ™„

Look, chess is a game, with rules and boundaries of play. It's not theoretical physics. We don't look at a pitcher and say "wow, this guy is so good at baseball, he must be a real brainiac!"

I don't disagree with the rest of your comment. Ron's not any dumber than a normal teenager, but god almighty the "chess makes you a brilliant strategist/has some relevance to the real world" is a really poor argument in Ron's favor. Is Dean a Mensa candidate because he's good at gobstones?

***** My twelve year old niece could probably beat me at uno, or something else like that. Look, I didn't say that to be controversial or edgy. Games have a very limited conceptual framework, with very little variability. There are rules and boundaries attached to the game, which provide a very basic set of possible outcomes.

So yes - Ron, from the moment we 'meet him' on the Express, /is/ an exceptional chess player. That is as relevant to being smart/belonging in an 'advanced' group as a FortNite player showing their world ranking to the admissions office at Harvard, and saying "see?"

Edit: upvoted you for being so nice and polite despite my uncontrollable confrontational tone, lol

****** Uno is a game of chance. Fortnight is a game that relies on quick reaction time and good hand eye coordination. Neither have much to do with intelligence or ingenuity (with perhaps the exception of professional fps which does require some strategic thinking).

Chess, however is a game that requires a very high degree of strategy, analysis and forethought. There are literally tens millions of possible board setups after just three moves and there is very real and documented correlation between higher IQ's and higher Elo chess ratings.

** Ron is lazy as fuck, you could use his laziness as a trope where he invents spells and enchantments to make his life easier, and do all the things he identifies as chore (homeworks, researchs, getting dressed, moving toward something) faster.

Super Lazy but madly innovative Ravenclaw Ron.

**** Yes! He was! And thank you for illustrating my point. Lockhart, despite being magically incompetent, managed to hoodwink nearly the entire population of Magical Britain. He was a brilliant conman, a marketing genius, and he went from being a nobody (halfblood, right?) to getting an Order of Merlin and being idolized on par with Albus Dumbledore.

He is the perfect example of how brains can take you places that inability would otherwise prevent. Ron is no Lockhart. Hell, I can't even imagine Hermione pulling off the kind of brilliance that Lockhart exhibited.

**** Ravenclaws don't have a lock on intelligence, so I'm not saying it's because he is dumb. Ron's just... not curious. He doesn't show any interest in learning for the sake of knowing something; he always must be forced into it. When there is no outside force motivating him, he hangs out and goofs around with his friends. Is that bad? No, that's pretty normal. But I don't see him as ever being suitable for Ravenclaw. Or Hufflepuff for that matter (loyalty's not exactly his strong point). I think Ron as a Slytherin (but not the absurd over-the-top Slytherin!Ron that bashing fics make him) wouldn't be terrible. He's witty, and has a sharp tongue.

****** Nah, I've always been consistent in feeling that Ron is very much an "Everyman" character. He acts like a regular Joe. I think the main reason he gets so much shit is that he is surrounded by genuinely heroic/noble/exceptional people (Neville, Harry, Hermione, etc), so Ron acting like any one of us regular people would in his shoes makes him seem cowardly/stupid/disloyal. The world can't be all Girl Genius and Wizard Jesus; there has to be the guys who stock shelves at Weasley Wizarding Wheezes after all. Ron fills that role.

**** I'd argue that Hufflepuff would be pretty good for the socially awkward but driven Hermione we see early on. And loyalty to Harry was her best trait throughout the series. She knew that the DoM was a trap (she was the only one concerned about this) but still went there. And she was the only person in magical Britain who suffered with Harry during the entire hunt (Ron had it pretty comfortable with Bill and the Order turned from armed resistance to being radio hosts). She even withstood torture by the leading expert in that field for him.

***** Yeah, Hufflepuff Hermione is not as much of a stretch as people make it sound like. Hermione values hard work, loyalty and fairness. She has a ruthless streak and she does certain unfair things but you don't have to tick off all the boxes of a house to fit in there.
