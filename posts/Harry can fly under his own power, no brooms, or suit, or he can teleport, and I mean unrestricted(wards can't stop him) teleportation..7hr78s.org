Title says it all. The only requirements I have is that it either be completed, past third year, or have more than 60k+ words. For example even if it's short, if it get's past third year I won't mind.

This isn't a requirement, but I would prefer if the freedom of flight/teleportation isn't undersold like i've seen in so many fics.

Thanks,

Warryn.

*** Haha. Actually I think there is a story, where when the dursleys visited Stark industries, they died, and Tony adopted Harry.

Thanks,
