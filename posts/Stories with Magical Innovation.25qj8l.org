** Try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5077573/1/RuneMaster][Runemaster]]. Harry drops divination for runes, and discovers that it comes very easy to him.

There's another that comes to mind, a tournament fic in which they changed the tasks. Harry makes his own broom for a racing task, they have a task when they have to make a potion to fight these huge giant like creatures, and there is a task where they have to hide from the other competitors. Maybe someone else will remember it from my description. :) When I have more time I will search a bit for it, I may have put it in my favorites.

Edit: As MeijiHao mentioned, the second story I was thinking of is [[https://fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/][Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon]]. It's a time travel fic, and it kind of gets crazy at times. It may not be your thing, and the creating bit is quite along into it, so I copied the broom making part for you to read so you can decide if you like it (sorry about the run on sentence!)

He knew the extra manoeuvrability would definitely come in handy- but the school brooms were simply too slow. Maybe I can build myself a better broom, he thought.

"I'm not sure I'm following your reasoning, Harry," Professor Vector said, looking at a set of messily scratched drawings that Harry had handed him. "Three and five are both closely associated with air, but three is preferable, as it's luckier. On top of that, four creates stability, and adding the two together makes seven; a very powerful combination. Nearly all brooms share this fundamental arrangement. We covered this in the analysis of your Firebolt..."

"I was thinking of one, one, and five, actually," Harry explained. "It's less stable, but more powerful, and I think it should have a higher affinity for air. It still totals to seven."

"Unstable? That's putting it lightly. Without a four, and with two of the same number, I'd be surprised if a person even managed to mount it. You'd need a dozen dampening charms to make it workable- that's just not worth the effort over the more common layout. I don't think any broom company could market a product like this..."

...

Working on his new broom was a much-needed distraction for Harry. In classes and during SNAPES meetings, he was constantly being hounded by the other students, asking for even more help with their work or just offering congratulations. Since Snape had found out about his namesake club (through the newspapers, no less) he also began publicly denouncing Harry- which, of course, resulted in an immediate backlash for deriding the Hogwarts champion in the presence of other schools. Consequently, the number of students attending SNAPES doubled within a week, and Harry was leaving a very good impression on those who attended. Now the only free time he had was late evening, which he often spent in an abandoned tower (accessible only by flying, as the stairs had collapsed) to work on his pet project.

Dobby and Hagrid were immensely helpful, and the advice from Professor Vector was invaluable. Hagrid's many trips into the Forbidden Forest produced many fine samples of ash wood, a few of which he could quickly carve out to emulate his Firebolt's main shaft. Finding proper birch twigs for the bristles was difficult, though, because of the stringent length, thickness, and straightness requirements. Clearly, the broom company grew their own trees instead of harvesting random twigs from the forest.

Dobby, while bringing him snacks, found an obvious solution. "Can Harry Potter sir fly with feathers?" And not just any feathers- with the Beauxbatons visiting, Hagrid was taking care of the abraxans. The huge winged horses were at least twice as big as a hippogriff and their feathers were correspondingly larger and stronger. With a little modification to his design, he didn't even have to charm twigs for flight- the feathers were already magical in nature. It was so obvious that Harry wondered why no wizard had ever thought of it before.

The end result, as Ron succinctly put it, was ridiculous. "You're riding a giant feather duster."

Hermione reassuringly told Harry, "Well, if you think about it, it's no sillier than riding a broom."

"What are you talking about? Brooms are for flying!" Ron protested.

"And what do you use to clean the floors?" Hermione put dryly.

"Mops."

"As much as I love magic, wizards are just plain ridiculous. I still can't believe nobody thought of using feathers for flying," she said, shaking her head.

"Muggles are the ones that aren't making sense," Ron said defensively. "Those airy-plane contraptions just don't make sense. At least wood is solid. Riding a machine that's made of paper, really..."

"Airplanes aren't made of paper!" Hermione argued.

"Then what are they made of?"

"Metal! Aluminium!"

"That's even more ridiculous! Metal? To fly? Now you're going to tell me that they make boats out of metal, too..."

"Uh... not to interrupt your argument, guys, but could you keep an eye on me while I go on my first flight with this thing? Just be ready to cast Arresto Momentum if anything goes wrong," Harry cut in, seeing they'd never stop bickering if they were left to themselves.

The test runs scared Hermione witless, naturally. Harry had forgone cushioning, braking, stability, and even durability charms on his first try to keep things as simple as possible. For the first time since picking up a broom, Harry honestly felt that the broom was capable of more than he was and that he needed more training to be able to handle it, and he only had a few more days for fine-tuning until the Trial of Air.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2889350/1/Bungle-in-the-Jungle-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure][Bungle in the Jungle]] by jbern has some interesting ward magic, but it's very popular so you've possibly read it already. The Lie I've Lived by the same author has Harry creating a sweet magical construct for one of the tasks.

More Equal than you Know by The Obsidian Warlock has some really cool explanations about magic, and some beginnings of spell creation, but it's abandoned.

** Here's a few more:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5101357/1/The-Potter-Family-Grimoire][The Potter Family Grimoire]] by DisobedienceWriter Harry Potter has an unprecedented amount of freedom the summer before his Third Year. He stumbles into an odd shop in Diagon Alley that will change his life forever. Harry Potter, T, English, Adventure & Supernatural, words: 19k+, favs: 2k+, follows: 548, May 31, 2009, Harry P.

This doesn't have Harry inventing stuff, exactly, but he is using his old family magic. Things that no one else knows about. It was very interesting.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4230389/1/A-New-Chance-Continued][A New Chance Continued]] Â» by pyrodaemon Managing to kill Lord Voldemort, Harry now faces the fates themselves. Watch as he's thrown back in time to his eleven year old self and given a second chance at life, a chance to right past wrongs. Harry Potter, M, English, chapters: 16, words: 118k+, favs: 4k+, follows: 5k+, updated: Apr 24, 2013 published: May 1, 2008, Harry P., Luna L.

This one also has a lot of runes in it.

There's another story that fits well into this theme that I haven't been able to find again. I read it on Fanfiction.net a few years ago. Harry was able to create objects, I think he enchanted them. I remember a scene where he made a CD player work in Hogwarts, and Hermione or one of the other muggleborns got him different CDs to go with it. Maybe he was involved with the twins? At the end of it he opened his own shop, which was extremely popular. No one knew that it was Harry's shop though. Harry worked as a helper in disguise during the grand opening. I think it was called something like, the enchanters apprentice, or similar. Sorry to bring it up if you can't read it, but I was hoping someone else might remember it. I've searched different combinations of everything I can remember, but I haven't been able to find it. It may have been taken down.

** I'd recommend Methods of Rationality, because Harry uses scientific principles to make a new discovery in transfiguration and test several other principles of magic... But it's pretty hardcore AU and I'm not sure how OoC you want Harry to be in these recs (and also because you need to read an enormous amount of story before he gets to that point).

**** I'm honestly in between. I mean, it's very funny sometimes and I can certainly respect what Eliezer was trying to do with it, but a lot of the characterizations fall straight into hp fanfiction tropes. The dumb Ron, crazy bastard Dumbledore, etc.

It's not EY's fault, I mean he hasn't even read the whole series, much less a lot of fanfiction about it.

All complaints aside, I love the podcast version. The voices help take me out of the fact it's a HP fanfiction and enjoy the story more. Which does tend to make me miss clues ("I'm not serious!" In particular stands out).
