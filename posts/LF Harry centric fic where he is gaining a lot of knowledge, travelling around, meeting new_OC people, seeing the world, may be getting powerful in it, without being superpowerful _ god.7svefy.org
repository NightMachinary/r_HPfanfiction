A good example would be linkffn(8303194). Powerful and awe inspiring magics, not super powerful that he is just being a smartass demolishing everything.

An other type of fic I liked were Journeyman / Apprentice Potter, at least before the third iteration (Master Potter) which got a bit too angsty

[[https://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Apprentice_Potter/index/]]

A good other example of a fic I liked would be Unspeakable things linkffn(6473434).

It doesn't have to be a Hogwarts rehash and all this /tralala/, it doesn't have to be against Voldemort and other things

Also for info, I already did read in this style : Bungle in the Jungle, A Cadmean Victory, Death Shall Have No Dominion, Dodging prisons and stealing witches, Emperor, Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path, Wasteland of Times, Knowledge is Power, Knowledge is Useful, butPower is Power, Make a Wish, Renegade Cause, RuneMaster, Wit Beyond Mesure.

Thank you !

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  This is the rewritten and revamped story, to be the best. in this story, Harry is in Slytherin, is more colder and a lot more similar to Lord Voldemort than ever before. Will he fight for the Light, The Dark or himself and his own side? Harry will be with other girls but will eventually end up with Daphne Greengrass and no it will not be a Harry/multi-wives/girlfriends story.
