** Harry just needed Crabbe and Goyle to stop moving and shielding Malfoy. /I would have a clear shot if only I could get them to stop - wait a minute, Arresto Momentum/.

Huh? Well I guess that's one way to make them stop moving. Shame about that window though

** I've only just realised how good a spell Arresto Momentum is, you could likely play around with it for all sorts of purposes. Being able to essentially control momentum is a hilariously powerful ability, might be related to how Voldemort can fly unassisted!

If /Arresto Momentum/ referred to stopping someone's momentum relative to space itself, they'd almost instantly be atomized (what with travelling through the train and, subsequently, our atmosphere) and flung through space (from our perspective) at just a bit faster than 1% the speed of light. Which is, relatively, very fast.

This is, of course, assuming they're fortunate enough that the Earth is rotated at a point which doesn't, when a full stop to momentum is applied, relatively have them attempt to go /through the planet/.

** Funny, but it'd have to be using [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_frame_of_reference#Absolute_space][the target's relative frame of reference,]] not an external one. Otherwise even using it when just standing on solid ground would've had disastrous consequences due to the momentum of Earth, our solar system, our galaxy, etc.

So using an Arresto Momentum on an accelerating object while being on a moving train would only make that object lose its acceleration /relative to the moving train/.

The spell could probably even be used to stabiliise / negate violent accelerations / decelerations of a vehicle that's currently hosting the target, and prevent inertia-related injuries like [[https://www.dolmanlaw.com/whiplash-painful-physics-action/][whiplash,]] essentially functioning as a perfect seatbelt.

**** Then the "really bad idea" part could be Harry trying to make his own brooms after this revelation and getting targeted by the Big Broom industry. Even worse if it's +the mudblood+ Hermione who gets to figure it out and gets targeted by some DE stakeholders. The latter would also explain Lucius' spending spree on 7 expensive brooms just to purchase bragging rights for a second year brat: being a stakeholder allowed him to skip the resellers and purchase them much closer to their production costs (if not even cheaper than that).

** Harry loved flying more than anything else. The freedom, the speed, the danger, it was all so amazing.

After the Dementor game had happened Harry got to thinking. He was lucky, lucky Dumbledore had been there to cast that spell.

Arresto Momentum slowed him enough so a fall from a few hundred meters didn't turn him into a crepe on the pitch. Harry spent some time learning the spell, better safe than sorry after all.

Then he realized he would need to learn it wandlessly.

Shite, that's going to suck.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Staying after Charms class Harry waved on his friends waiting to talk to the professor.

"Sir, I was hoping you could help me. After I fell during the game I've been learning the slowing charm. Well, I want to learn ot wandlessly now. So if there is another fall I will be okay."

Flitwick looked at the boy as he thought. He was a powerful practical caster and had good head for theory.

He had to admit falling from cloud level while being chased by dementors would likely be a powerful motivator.

"Alright Mr. Potter, I reccomend you start with the Book 'Stolen Sticks and Other Failed Focus Findings: Wandless Wizards Working With Mastered Magics'"

Flitwick told him where to find the book in the library and sent the boy off. It was not wandless magic for all, it focused on mastering spells individually without a wand. Something a 3rd year could learn with hard work.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Harry stared at the hole in the castle walls and decided discretion was the better part of valor.

What the hell had happened? He overpowerr the AM spell wanting to see how long the ink pot would stay floating in the room.

Instead it had blasted away faster than a blink and the castle had a fist sized hole in it.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Experimenting around over the next month told him whatever was going on with the spell was consistent.

The objects always flew the same direction. Slighty upwards and west. The more he overpowered the spell the faster they went.

Harry had no idea why this was happening but all this working with directions had a side effect. Harry was now constantly aware of what direction west was in relation to himself.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

*Alternate Take from this point on also available below this post.*

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Malfoy and company continued their bullshit as the track curved. With a flick of his fingers Harry cast a lightly overpowered Arresto Momentum at the troublesome trio discreetly.

Watching the idiot squad fly down the hallway was a great way to end the school year.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Staring at himself where he floated above the stairs he knew he was in trouble now. Dudley had pushed him down the stair and he snap cast AM wandlessly without thinking.

When no owl arrived by dinner that night Harry realized the ministry did not track wandless magic.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

His relatives were frozen in fear as Vernon looked up from the bottom of the stairs.

Harry had used a lightly overpowered AM and smashed Vernon into the stairs a few times.

"No more chores, no more locks, all the food I want and you touch me I break every bone in your body until you are broken mess. Only warning, deal with it."

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Circling the arena Harry made his way to the western edge. Flicking out his fingers he cast AM on the golden egg. Thank goodness the spell was colorless, silent and had no light show attached.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

At the graveyard Pettigrew closed his eyes raising the knife to his hand. Harry knew what was going to happen to his horror.

"Flesh of the servant willing given, you will revive your master."

Oh bloody hell no! Harry desperately cast a massively overpowered wandless Arresto Momentum at the Cauldron.

It disappeared into the sky leaving a sonic boom in its place that smashed Peter into a gravestone.

A ruddy big snake showed up fairly soon afterwards and it soon joined the cauldron as a reverse shooting star.

After a few minutes he got free. Picking up a broken headstone he smashed the bones of Peter's limbs.

"Run away this time you stupid fucking rat!"

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Dumbledore had went on and on after the ministry finally found him hours later. Voldemort was surely back or some shit. Harry disagreed quite heavily and that had made him a good friend of the minister it seemed.

Whatever all he knew was while Tom may be immortal, he was immortally flying through space at thousands of miles an hour away from Earth.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Harry Potter was approaching his 300th birthday. Thank goodness for aging potions. According to every expert he had dealt with over the years him sending Voldemort on an extrasolar trip had frozen the prophecy. Which had frozen his aging, at 14, until the prophecy was fulfilled.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

The great space age had happened, Arresto Momentum had been the keystone spell to it all. It affected inertia, gravity, and even time interacted with an object.

Digging deep into the arthimancy of the spell had been a dozy. How the hell the spell had been developed to begin with was a damn mystery.

It somehow bypassed relativity in the most convoluted way imaginable. Seriously the spell was the holy grail of space travel.

** I played with this in a drabble one time. Harry had a banishing hex that cancelled momentum first, to give whiplash effects and increase how hard it hit, and so on. When duelling Voldemort, he cast it with his off hand, and fucked up the motion - so it cancelled all momentum, not just relative momentum like it was supposed to.

Essentially, the spell would have stopped Voldemort's motion relative to the planet, and he would have shot up into space at escape velocity. Fortunately, or unfortunately, the spell ended up liquefying him before it could get that far.

  Harry Potter found that the spells he was learning in books did not quite do the job. So he recruited the three smartest witches he knew and set them loose. The Wizarding World will never be the same. A collection of loosely connected one-shots focused on ridiculous spell ideas and the little-known dangers of fooling around with Magic.
