Can you guys give me ideas for fanfics so I can write them in the future. They should be Harry centric, and I cannot write slash, Harry X Ginny or Harry X Hermione Thanks a lot... Also my ffn pen name is Flaming Drongo


** Harry starts acting strangely after fourth year. He's hurting people and just smiling right through it. He laughs at random times for no apparent reason. He seems too calm. Some people swear he's been looking at them with a strange glint in his eyes. He just doesn't seem to feel guilty about anything.

Everyone thinks he's getting into dark magic, but it's worse than that. So much worse. Dark magic will amplify darker emotions like anger, fear, disgust, guilt. The dark exists wherever there is no light, and so it is difficult but altogether a simple matter to brighten the darkness.

But light simply pushes all darkness aside, and so is almost impossible to dim. Harry feels only positive emotions like happiness, love, peace, joy. All the time. No matter what.

(Edit: I like your pen name!)

**** There's a non-zero chance it's Paul Jennings' Un! series and for some reason my brain is telling me that's it, although I can't for the life of me remember why.

****** ‚ÄúDidn't expect you to know it.‚Äù he says.

‚ÄúWhy not? Why wouldn't I recognise it given were are literally on the SP subredd--- oh wait, we're not. This is Harry Potter.‚Äù

So yeah, weirdly enough I think I remember that scene. Although as you can see my memory is sketchy at absolute best.

** Hmm you can always go for the obvious overused prompts like wbwl Harry and Harry gets betrayed. There are several...

-Harry gets adopted by either muggle or magical family

-Harry grows up in an orphanage (whether he grows up dark if up to you)

-What if prompts (What if Harry met Hermione first) (What if Cho went to the ball with Harry) (What if Snape didn't die)

-Harry gets betrayed (the typical depiction of Dumbledore being senile and Ron, Hermione stealing money from Harry)

-Harry becomes a Lord (very political, smart)

-Oneshots of Adult Harry (as an Auror, father, godfather..)

-If Harry died in the tournament (quite an emotional fanfic)

-If Harry's Patronus was different (interesting take, dramatic events can impact)

-Lily and James are alive (either they thought he was dead or some other reason)

Just prompts I thought off the top of my head. Hope this helps :)

** Lately, I'm in the mood for light, 50k words stories.

So that's my idea. I would love a fic about a holiday romance. I would really like something that have that feeling of summer, the passion, the excitement and the sensation of trying something new.

I honestly don't care much about who you choose to write about, but I would prefer an OC (if that's OK with you, not everyone wants to write one)

Bonus points if he (she) is really charming, daring, affectionate, with an easy-going attitude

Like I said, they're both young, it's just a summer thing, nothing serious but that doesn't mean it's any less amazing or has less imporntance that other future (longer, more serious) romances.

What do you think of it?

I hope you like the idea. Sorry if I had mistakes, I'm fairly new to English.

PS: Can you give a link for your account?

**** I've recently read a story in which Harry takes every opportunity for malicious compliance, and I think it could be very fun to see more. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21949021?view_adult=true][Here's the link.]]
