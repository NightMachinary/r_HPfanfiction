It's been down for a few days now. Anyone know anything about it?


** It's only been dead for a day. It died last night.

*** It's been more that 2 days since I could access it and IsItDown said it was down for more than a week.

**** That's weird I accessed it and downloaded a story about 4 days ago. And checked to see if another story had been updated 2 days ago. Last night fanfictionbot accessed it for one story but failed on the second (and i know the link was correct). It was when I checked to see what happened that I first couldn't access it.
