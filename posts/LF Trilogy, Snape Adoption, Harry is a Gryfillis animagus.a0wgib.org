Series that follows Harry's adoption by Snape, defeat of Voldemort, and then Author career. I'd give more details, but I don't want to spoil it.

Easily one of my favorite works, but my phone was stolen recently and I've forgotten the name of the series.


** If you want help finding it, more details are better regardless of spoilers.
