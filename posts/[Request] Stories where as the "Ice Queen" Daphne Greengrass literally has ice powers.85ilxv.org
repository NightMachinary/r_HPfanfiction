***** Good question.

Canonically, Astoria marries Draco, but books!Draco doesn't map very well to Kristoff. CursedChild!Draco is better. I think it could be made to work.

Some pureblood OC would probably be easiest for Hans, just have them be a relative of a recognisable last name.

It appears that all of Draco/Astoria happens post-graduation, so if you want Elsa!Daphne to do interesting things to Voldie it'll take a long time to get to the sister's-romantic-life subplot.

This kind of story usually works best as "Daphne gets Elsa's memories, some powers and a personality meld", which begs the question of when does the ISOT happen?

**** No... IIRC it was the one where Hermione's mom is some kind of dragon, and Hermione does some kind of heart-sharing ritual with Harry after he gets entered in the TT, and they end up as dragons.

Daphne (and her mother and sister) being Ice!Veelas was a side-thing, that came up in passing.

  Response to GoldenSteel's My gf is a what? challenge. GoF: Hermione has a secret. One that even she doesn't know. When she unearths a highly dangerous ritual to help Harry in the first task, the two of them never expected that secret to hit them both and change them into Great Dragons! Are they doomed to be treated as beasts? What does this mean for the TWT? H/Hr; AD/RW/MW putdown.

********* Well, he might. Love is not logical after all, especially if they have a few things in common (a hatred of Draco Malfoy would IMHO be enough or something like the troll scene from the first book, just say in book 5 and instead of the damned beast it's a couple of seventh years (or Draco and his goons!))

Also: These "that would never happen" things are the flavour in fanfiction (I only have one thing I don't accept and that's slash (you can't change sexual orientation that's rooted to deep in someone, but everything else just really needs a catalyst IMHO!))!

*** Yup, it's only in fanfics where she's given this "untouchable" personal hence the term "Ice Queen/Princess." She was never given a background story in the books. So I thought it would be funny if she had actual ice powers.

  When George and Fred give Harry the Marauders map, they merely intend to allow Harry to travel to Hogsmeade for a day of fun and levity. Harry notices something on it however and heads off to investigate, unearthing an entirely new direction for his destiny to follow. Elements of Frozen will influence characters and scenes in the story.
