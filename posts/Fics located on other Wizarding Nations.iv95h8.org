I've really enjoy when writers take Harry out of Britain to explore other cultures and Magical societies, so far /"A simple act of vengeance"/ has done a great work doing that and I would love to know if you know other stories like it?


** Make a Wish is kind of the classic Globetrotting Harry recommendation. He goes the full circumnavigation.

linkffn(2318355)

There's also the second of the Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider series. Petunia is Lara Croft, basically, and she raises Harry on dig sites. The first series is mostly him at Hogwarts with bits of her around the world, but the second has Harry himself Globetrotting. I do think you kinda need to read the first for the second to make sense though. Link below is to the first one.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

** Glad you liked all the traveling in ASAoV! I felt like it was a bit of a risk, but I really enjoyed writing my version of MACUSA.

As for other fics, I think that Bungle in the Jungle stands out as another "travelogue" (Harry goes to.. like, 4 continents in that one). Rise of the Wizards kind of has some international flavor, but it's pretty sparse. And of course, there's an excellent (and long!) oneshot set in Egypt with cursebreaker!Harry, called Valley of the Kings Massacre, i believe.

Happy reading!

*** Feature request: can we get more methods of execution than the stone spike? (unless you consider it as Harry's signature and it's for plot reasons).

Also, random question (spoilers): Daphne never did tell Harry about the money her family already had when Harry gave to Astoria, did she? It's kind of a moot point with her parents dead, but it does showcase her to be a bit of a selfish bitch. I think I'm firmly in the Susan boat after the latest chapters.

**** Okay! Thanks for reading, first off :) It's been awesome hearing from people on this sub that read my story (most of the feedback i hear comes from discord).

Regarding your questions: the >stone spike was Harry's first 'killshot', so I've had him default to it as a simple, quick way to kill. As we saw with Rosier, when he wants to make someone suffer, he is more than capable. It's just a matter if him being angry enough...<

Daphne: >she never knew exactly what her dad did to gain the money. She really only knows what Lucas told her - vague generalities, and what he said when Sam had them captive. I tried to show, whe she visited Tori in the hospital after First Year, how she was afraid that Harry would not believe she was innocent in taking his money, and was too ashamed to bring it up <

Hope that answers your questions!

  Bill Weasley nearly ruined Adi's life--until the fearsome Potions Master changed it.In 1990, Cho Chang's older cousin Adeline is not the only witch at Hogwarts to fall for the dashing, loaded Gringotts cowboy--with dire consequences. Now she must fight out of a fugue state to salvage her once-promising academic career with an unlikely ally in Professor Snape.Upon graduation Adi accepts a risky position on the International Task Force stationed in China, which has been plagued for centuries by both Muggle and Wizard political strife. A meteoric rise in diplomacy finally brings her back to Hogwarts in 1996 to visit as the newly-appointed British Ambassador to the United Chinese Nations (U.C.N.)There she finds a Severus Snape burdened by a Darkness both terrifying and alluring, and the charged, clandestine attraction between them is at last realized against an international backdrop of the Second Wizarding War. Though it may mean risking her very life, Adeline races to find a way to save the man who once was the only person who cared enough to save her.
