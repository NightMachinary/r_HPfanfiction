Or some setup like that. Just no bashing.


** *The twinkling man in a boys little body.*

/Potter, Harry!/

When Harry Potter's name was called, Albus expected to see a normal, muggleborn/muggleraised child. But of course there always is something wrong, because, well, it just always is. Albus sent a light legilimency probe into Harry, like he always does to new children, fully expecting to see emotions of worry, fear, excitement like all the other children. What he didn't however expect was to encounter a master occlumens, - Well, he didn't see it at first, but he noticed eventually that he was being given false emotions - probably one of the best he's ever seen. He looked at Harry in shock, while harry merely raised one eyebrow and smiled. Then he also noticed that his eyes also twinkled, almost like his does - Well people say his does, but he never actually noticed it in the mirror - so imagine when he could feel that Harry Potter was not a boy, nor a normal child. He was a man, inside, a man far above his age.

Harry strode confidentially and elegantly up to the sorting hat, seemingly ignoring the whispering. The smile on his face seemingly got wider and wider, until a small, gasp was heard. From the sorting hat. Never, ever, was such a thing happened before. Then Harry sighed, and just continued sitting and discussing something with the sorting hat. Then the sorting hat said this:

/''This boy needs to go up to the staff table and discuss with something with Professor Dumbledore''/

...

/''I'm a time traveler somehow, i am/was 85 years old.''/
