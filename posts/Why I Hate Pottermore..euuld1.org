** While I certainly won't defend the dumpster fire that is JKRs hot takes, I would push back on the idea that the original books aren't ethnically diverse. Dean Thomas and Kingsley Shacklebolt were black, Zabini was described as dark-skinned as well, though no explicit background was stated, Parvati and Padma Patil can be assumed to be of Indian descent, Cho Chang can be assumed to be Asian. I don't recall race ever being used to create stereotypical caricatures. They were just people who happened to be of a certain race/ethnicity.

**** The year of the Weasley twins has like half of the known characters black (Lee, Angelina and Alicia). I feel like overall, countries of origin were well balanced all things considered, and perhaps the only change you'd need to make in a modern reboot would be to include someone of Polish decent, but that only became relevant after the Eastern expansion of the EU in 2004.

I honestly hate how books/movies/pop culture try to be inclusive/not racist/whatever and add people of different ethnicities just to seem "progressive".

Ffs, 1000 years ago, in Scandinavia, there were no black Vikings. A black Viking is not realistic. It's hard get immersed into the plot if the environment (or demographics) is unrealistic. I would enjoy a movie more if it's accurate and immerses me, not because of that one best friend, that has to be of a minority, regardless of the logic.

Furthermore, as a member of a minority group - this "quota" gets old and feels insincere.

I would love to see films like this enter the mainstream, and more foreign films enter Western cinemas and not only in indie ones. I don't want to travel across the city to see a foreign film when there are five cinemas around the corner and over the bridge because it becomes a hassle on a Saturday night.

I've seen Netflix films recently where they shove "progressive" views into a scene, but it really has /nothing/ to do with the main plot. Boy meets girl, girl has married gay best friends, gay best friends say sarcastic comment, girl falls in love with boy. It's shoe-horned in to appear progressive. Make more films with a gay lead who has straight friends in the background.

************************ True, there are words that aren't slurs that can cause folks to experience trauma. Unfortunately we don't have a good way to prevent that. But it's super easy to not use slurs to at least prevent some folks from experiencing trauma associated with those words.

I know of folks having trauma attached to literally anything. Again, unfortunately, that's not something that's reasonable to expect. But slurs? Expect that there are folks that associate their trauma to those words. There's no reason to use them.

See, I feel your approach is to just say "well, every word could elicit traumatic experiences to someone, so fuck everyone, I'll say whatever I want." While I support the idea that, at the very least, use of slurs shouldn't be criminalized, from a social standpoint, I see no social upside to the use of slurs, at all. I disregard your slippery slope argument because there are a group of words that as a culture we have determined to be slurs and there are other ways to refer to the things slurs refer to. Sometimes we add to that list of words. I hope more people are learning to understand that "tranny," for example, is a slur when used to refer to transgender people. Our vocabulary evolves as we evolve socially, and that includes evolving our language to render slurs unnecessary.

Back to the original statement I made. There is zero reason for a straight person to use the word f****t. Zero reason. It is not a useful word. I don't use it and I'm not even a straight person. I personally believe straight people should not use the word. You think straight people should use the word? Ok, we disagree. I live in a country where people get to disagree with one another, and where people can say pretty much whatever they want.

You're never going to change my mind, no matter how many what ifs and what abouts you pose. I'm steadfast in my position, and in my belief it is a reasonable and logical position. You are free to disagree all you want. I don't expect to change your mind either. I suggest you not waste any more time trying to change my mind, because it's not happening.

Secondly saying that there is zero reason for a strait person to say it is gross. No one type of people can own a word. If black people dislike nigger they shouldn't say it either.

*** I didn't say there weren't ethnically diverse characters because that would be a lie, but the story was predominantly white (e.g. Harry, Hermione, Ron, Dumbledore, the Weasley's, the Malfoy's, Sirius, Voldemort etc.) Pretty much every main character was white.

I'm not arguing that that is inherently a bad thing, as I don't go around with a clipboard claiming content is only good when there a certain quota is reached. But I feel JK Rowling certainly has an issue with it and jumps at the idea for an image change through Pottermore and her tweets.

It's the reverse of characters like Hermione, who was written to be a white character imo. It's still a bit bizarre that there's no significant characters of color, but there are a million redheads.

I will give her credit for having diverse love interests -- Parvati and Padma being considered really attractive was memorable for me as a kid, as I rarely even got to read books with Indian characters.

Perhaps a culture clash - assuming you are American. The percentage of the UK population with red hair is [[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24331615][around 10%]]. In comparison, the UK is around 13% non-white. So you'd expect to see roughly equal number of redheads and non-white people.

Edit: that said, the vast majority of the UK's non-white population migrated to the UK following WW2. The reasons for those migrations (mainly, the ease of immigration during decolonisation) would seem fairly unique to the Muggle world, so you might expect wizarding Britain to have a significantly lower percentage of non-white people.

** I just want to note: You shouldn't focus all your ire on JK. Potterverse has progressed to corporate juggernaut status, and like Disney or Star Wars or other international franchises, the art changes to fit the expected market.

HP was never about world building, it was primarily story driven (followed by characters, and then followed waaaaaaaaaaaaaay behind by world building). So if, for instance, HP proves amazingly successful in Japan (which it **very much was**), then it isn't surprising that one of the schools of magic is going to be based out of there.

Expecting otherwise is like expecting LucasArts wasn't going to include a cute, toy-marketable droid in any version of Star Wars that they make. (Before they sold it, not that Disney is going to do any different).

My issue with this isn't at all about the physical skin descriptions. It's that Hermione's character arc in the books anchors specifically on the fact that she's never really faced discrimination before. It's not even on her radar. IMO, a not-white Hermione with the same traits -- worldly, well-read, compassionate -- facing a world with discrimination, hate groups, slavery, etc, would not react in the same way. This would not be her first time hearing about these topics in relation to herself.

Writing a main character of color requires more than just describing their skin. To me, JKR wrote a white character here, and I think she reveals a bit about how she thinks about race when she acts like it doesn't impact characterization at all.

And it's okay that Hermione's white! She works as a device for readers to relate and see why these things are terrible! They'd all be muggleborns too, so it kind of drives home the whole hating people over arbitrary things like blood is really bad point. It works for a kids book.

***** I would argue most of the characters races are only implicit, not explicit. Anyone who is "default white" is probably not described as white, which, although not done on purpose by the author no doubt, nevertheless provides room for the reader to build their own interpretation. This is what the essay Death of the Author promotes, the idea of valuing the reader's interpretation and devaluing the writers' interpretation, so that readers stop thinking of books as having just one correct interpretation. I feel these discussions about black Hermione still seem to revolve around this idea that a there is a single correct interpretation. It seems assumed that JKR thinks so, anyway, or else she would be able to support another theory without controversy. The way I see it, she devalued her own interpretation by showing support for other possibilities. In this case (not necessarily in other cases, but in this case), she acted in line with the Death of the Author essay.

#+end_quote

Not only this, but she told Yates and the screenwriters Dumbledore was gay when creating the 4th movie as they wanted to have Dumbledore dance with his wife. This is before Deathly Hallows. She never reconned Dumbledore. She just didn't want to directly state it because 1) her writing style doesn't support it and 2) it was the early 2000s and already had people burning her books. I felt DH made it pretty damn obvious Dumbledore was gay. I don't get why it needs to be directly stating. I love when a book makes a reader think though.

All this came about because people were up in arms over Hermione's actress being black in the play. It was Rowling being snarky to the racists and lending support to the brilliant actress. Once again, it wasn't reconning at all. As an inspiring author myself (and working on a hp fanfic to improve my writing), I love hearing how people imagine my characters. It's neat, and a fully support someone imaging my characters differently.

*** UPDATE: We are both wrong. Rolf is his grandson thus it is reasonable that Rolf's mother could have been black to reasonably make Rolf /'swarthy'/ whilst keeping Newt and Tina white.

However, J.K. Rowling had the opportunity to put her money where her mouth is and insist Newt Scamander or Porpentina Goldstein be cast as black/mixed race to show she was progressive or whatever and she did no such thing.

Just like how she mentioned Grindelwald and Dumbledore had an intense sexual relationship before a movie she wrote where the relationship between the two of them is a literal plot point and does not at all imply, just as was the case in the books, that they were actually in love/lust with one another.

Probably because she doesn't actually give a fuck about seeming progressive. I never understood why people thought she did. She's a transphobe, she had like one character be gay, and that's kinda it?

The reality is just that she thought Dumbledore was gay, never gave a serious fuck about LGBT or black people, and that's all there is to it. I hate that gay characters can't just exist without people expecting it to be plot important or accusing authors of wanting political points.

****** She didn't write it as a tweet? She didn't write it down at all, actually

I'm getting the impression that you might not be getting your information from the horses mouth?

You have to apply historical context to this. JK didn't say Harry is gay or Hermione is a lesbian or whichever character is X.

She answered a fan question in 2007, two months after DH was released, that Dumbledore was gay. Reading DH again, you can see that Dumbledore has enough feeling and emotion for Grindelwald to leave his family for the summer. This is where the sexual element comes in - Dumbledore acted on his feelings, much like anyone when they first fall in love/have a crush - and JK said that "the relationship was incredibly intense". Now that does not mean sex. That means that their relationship to each other grew strong very quickly. She then goes on to say "it was passionate, and it was a love relationship. But as it happens in any relationship, gay or straight... one never knows really what the other person is feeling. You can't know, you can believe you know."

That is from an interview on the Blue-ray disc of FB1. Not twitter.

None of that says they had passionate, rampant sex. What that does tell you, and from what we know of Grindelwald, is that he is a great manipulator. So, his "love" for Dumbledore was not real. Dumbledore comes home from school, meets a boy who is crazy smart and he gets along with like a house on fire and falls in love with Grindelwald and abandons his family. Grindelwald capitalises on this and although he is Dumbledore's friend, he knows he can manipulate him.

Historical context - it was not as socially acceptable to come out as gay in the 90s (when the books are set), and there was a very real fear (as there still is today) to come out as gay. Dumbledore was born in 1800s. JK Rowling was born in 1960s. Ellen Degeneres came out as gay in 1997, George Michael in 1998, it was not a thing people talked about as easily as it is now. To say that JK is attempting to be progressive to keep on trending? Euy.

She never said this, actually, this was the impression made by headlines to make it seem like she did.

Here are the relevant quotes. I've highlighted the parts that were cut out and re-ordered so as to seem more shocking in the headlines.

#+begin_quote
  "It's not easy being Dumbledore. He's mistrusted by the Ministry. They know he has this dark past in which he flirted with Grindelwald's ideology. This was the part of Potter that I was most interested in revisiting because the relationship between Grindelwald and Dumbledore is key to making Dumbledore /Dumbledore/.
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  *Their relationship was incredibly intense, it was passionate, and it was a love relationship*. But as happens in any relationship, gay or straight, or whatever label you want to put on it, one never knows really what the other person is feeling. You can't know, you can believe you know, *so I'm less interested in the sexual side (though I believe there is a sexual dimension to this relationship) than I am in the sense of the emotions they felt for each other*. Which ultimately is the most fascinating thing about all human relationships.

I did this research at the time of this particular controversy and have no reason to believe she said anything relevant to this controversy outside this featurette. If I'm mistaken, I'm happy to change my tune if someone can direct me to a full and sourced quote.

As a person who should have been swarthy except for some weird genetic dice-rolling, that's typically an olive to dark tan complexion with dark hair.

Also, in Victorian literature swarthy was a mildly xenophobic term used to describe Mediterranean people and typically in a rude context, i.e. "He was a swarthy little man of stocky stature with a greasy face and beady eyes" (not a direct quote from anything, but typical of its usage in Sherlock Holmes and similar lit).

So you /do/ know she didn't claim Hermione was black. Why are you spreading misinformation then? She didn't make Hermione black. She was just saying you could picture Hermione however you want in response to the ridiculous racists.

And what book quote? Hermione's "white face" which was obviously in reference to her fear? Ron is described as purple at one point too, and green in another part. Is he actually these colors? Of course not.

Now obviously Rowling pictured her as white, but you're still wrong. She didn't claim Hermione was black and there's nothing in the books to indicate she's absolutely white either. Again, pale skin is not something only white people can have.

The natural and obvious reading is that the narrative is emphasising how easy it is to spot Hermione, while she and Harry are trying to hide from notice, by drawing a visual comparison between Hermione's white face and the dark of the tree.

***** I was highlighting my point that she was making the world seem more diverse and progressive than it had previously (in the books) by bringing up Ilvermorny. A point I highlighted in my post.

Gonna hit you with a fact, I am black. My family is black. My extended family is black. My best friend in highschool is black. A few of my ex-girlfriends are black. A few of my former bullies were black. A few of my teachers and other adults in my life, were black. Wanna know something... incredible? Not ONCE have I seen them, or any other person sharing any variation of my skin colour turn WHITE when afraid. You can argue just as easily that 'turning green' is using a common metaphor. Just as you can for 'purple with rage', as people with paler skin noticeably change colours when visibly enraged. Often to red and darker shades.

Turning white, though also in that vein, discounts a huge swathe of people in the world who's skin is black or brown, because it isn't physically possible. If she'd "paled", then this discussion wouldn't be happening. But by NOT explicitly stating Hermione to be black and then writing out that she turned white, again something *we can't do* then she ensured Hermione could never be black.

The person who 'spread misinformation' was Rowling when she said "white skin was never specified" when it literally was.

Swarthy has a LITERAL definition that you are ignoring because you don't want to concede a point. Type in turquoise in google images, many of the images on that first page are NOT that specific shade of greenish-blue. Does that suddenly mean that turquoise doesn't mean what it literally means? No. So why would "swarthy" be any different. Like I said, if it isn't black then it is mixed-raced, which implies mixed-heritage. Thus, someone in the family ain't white.

Is this really the hill you wanna die on? Arguing the definition of a word because a few pictures don't match?

/The word is usually used to describe someone whose skin is weather beaten and darkened by the sun, or has an olive complexion./

Peeves was in the books, but not in the movies.

Several moments with the Weasley's, were given to Hermione or another character in the movies, when it was in the books.

Theater companies fit the play to the actors that they have, not the other way around.

I have a lot of problems with Pottermore, and their changes to the world established by the books. However, at no point in the books was Dumbledore's sexuality established, and nothing that I've read on Pottermore has changed the established race, gender, or sexuality of a character.

I also have a lot of problems with the new Grindelwald movies, but most of them have to do with timelines, continuity, and Mary Sues.

*** Absoulutly. Theater is a very different form of media from either a book or a movie. It's a live performance that brings you into the world, and a good actor can make you /believe/ in the impossible with no props or fancy costumes. I have countless issues with the Cursed Child but the actors are well chosen.

Take Hamilton for instance. It is a musical based on actual history and people, but the race of the actors doesn't matter.

Personally, I don't care whether JK says Dumbledore is gay or not. His sexuality never comes up in the books or movies. However, if she is going to say that he had a romantic and sexual relationship with Grindlewald and then go on to help write a new movie series involving the fight between them, I would expect it to come up. In this case the story changes a lot based on just how Dumbledore sees GG and vice versa.

As for Cursed Child, it is just fanfiction. And bad fanfiction at that. It blatentely contridicts cannon mechanics (mostly regarding time turners) and is a bad mess. It isn't well written and the plot holes break the entire universe. The performance is better than just reading the script, but that is because of the brilliant actors and everyone behind the scenes of the production bringing it together.

So, I'm not sure whether it would change Dumbledore's behavior. I can imagine he might feel more vunerable to someone he allowed himself to truly love in that way and be intimate with, but I can't be sure.

I think what bothers me more is that JK made this big deal about Dumbledore being gay, and later added he was involved with Grindlewald. For me, I thought that saying he was gay was fine but then retconning backstory was like cheating. Still, though, my ideology was if this was an important aspect of the charector she didn't really have an opportunity for it to become relavent or something. Sure, DH expands a bit on Dumbledore's past but the exact nature and deatails of their relationship wasn't relavent to the story and would have only distracted from everything else going on.

However, she now has a movie series where this is a relavent factor. Or at least, glossing over it makes the entire thing feel disingenuous and just like a way for her to get a pat on the back without really thinking or caring about the story and charectors.

** I don't believe how JK "Never imagined Hermione as white". JK had a much bigger creative control over the movies than authors usually have and she made a lot of decisions, like how all the actors had to be British, it had to be shot in Britain, and she herself decided on a lot of the actors of the movies, like Robbie Coltrane. I find it very hard to believe that she didn't have a say in which skincolour Hermione would have, since everyone else was correctly cast according to their characters skincolour and JK's visions of them.

With that being said, I was never bothered by the choice of actress for TCC, all that matters (especially in theater) is how good of an actress she is. If she portrayed Hermione absolutely beautifully, she's perfect for the role. I just don't like how JK is trying to play it off and how she's trying to be so politically correct even when it's done and over with.

*** I have no doubt that JKR imagines Hermione as white. I feel like the confusion about this comes in because people do not feel JKR has shown support of another interpretation. From what I can tell, people believe JKR is trying to pretend she had actually written her as black all along. But I feel that is such a bizarre and easily disproved lie, that I am still trying to understand why anyone believes this is what happened.

When viewed through the lens that she is supporting another interpretation, then her quotes no longer look like she is trying to pretend something so obviously not true. It instead looks like she was supporting an interpretion different from what she imagined when writing. I thought this is what authors were supposed to do, encourage other interpretatons. This whole thing was blown so far out of proportion.

It is also worth noting that it was the directors idea to hire a black actress. I have many issues with Rowling, especially lately, so I'm not saying this blindly in her defense, but because this whole situation has so bizarrely escalated in blaming JKR for something I cannot see that she actually did.

She makes a statement that doesn't align with modern day gender politics? TERF, deserves to die.

Plenty is wrong with Pottermore. Mainly, it conflates book and film canon and is largely full of pandering crap. This is for the most part because JKR /isn't/ very involved with it anymore.

Equally clear is that JKR needn't have received death threats for her unfortunate phrasing.

Even clearer: she does not need money or more attention and saying she does anything for these reasons says more about the person saying it.

That said, I'm sad and don't give a pass on the fact that they didn't canonize this announcement with the Grindelwald movies.

1. If JK wants to change something to her universe, she has every rigth to, it's her creation, she can do whatever she wants with it. Who are we to tell her she can't ? It's just ridiculous.
2. I don't mind Dumbledore being gay, it was revealed so long ago and when I read HP7 I could feel some undertones. The fact that his sexuality was not part of the story, is better in itself because it had nothing to do with Harry's story. It has everything to do with Grindelwald's story.
3. What really bothered me with black Hermione is that JK said she never specified Hermione race, which is totally false. She should have said "Hermione was written as white and I drew her as such, but her skin colour has very little to do with her journey in the books. She can be black, asian, indigenous looking. It doesn't matter."
