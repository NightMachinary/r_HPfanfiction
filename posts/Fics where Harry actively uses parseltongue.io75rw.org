I'm looking for fics where Harry uses parseltongue more freely. Like going into the Slytherin common room by hissing "open" in parsel and things like that. Where he is a more cunning Gryffindor who is willing to embrace his Slytherin tendencies....

Curiosity killed the cat, satisfaction brought it back. Harry's curiosity leads him to exploring the Chamber a bit more thoroughly before he leaves for the Summer. What he finds there gives him a new responsibility beyond just himself and a lifelong satisfaction in the choices he makes from there on.

*** Overall this was a good story. I'd warn that it starts out ok, and then moves so slowly for a fairly long stretch (like 10-20% of the file) that I almost stopped reading. After that, though, it picks up. I'd also say that the story's overall direction was different than the setup made me expect at first, but that was fine. I'd have been interested in seeing my imagined version too.

  The voices Harry heard, those no one else could, were the only ones that spoke kindly to him growing up. They had spread their whispers across the world to rescue him and at last, found a way; by creating a queen of serpents. The birth of the amber-eyed empress triggers a permanent change in Harry's life, as he enters a world of magic that may protect or destroy him.

It's stumbling on stories like this one that makes me keep coming back to the subreddit.

***** If anything, it /un/-bashes Dumbledore (who's firmly in "competent adult" mode here, right down to "Dursleys abuse Harry and I didn't realize it, better do everything I can to make up instead of keeping him there") and Ron just ends up being his normal, friendly-but-occasionally-tactless self.

The only /hint/ at a pairing so far is Harry getting a kiss on the cheek from Tonks, so no harem stuff either.

**** Harry talks to snakes more regularly when growing up, they feel protective of him but can't actually do anything to the Dursleys because these are small common garden snakes we're talking about here, so they walk him through the process to hatch a basilisk. The zoo incident goes down a little more severely than in canon and Vernon ends up briefly petrified (only briefly, and not dead, on account of the basilisk still being very young), giving Harry the chance to flee to Mrs. Figg who has the common sense to send for authorities when she sees the state Harry's in.

That's just the executive summary of the first chapter, IDK where it goes from there yet. There's some hand-waving about how the snakes know what they do (basilisk ritual, that Mrs. Figg is magic-adjacent) but otherwise it seems like a good enough fic so far.

  ONE-SHOT: After Arthur Weasley nearly dies at the Ministry, Harry wonders why Voldemort's snake isn't something more exotic...really, no self-respecting Parseltongue should limit himself to something as mundane as a regular snake. In which Harry makes use of what he learned in Care of Magical Creatures, Kreacher is forced to cooperate, and the Chamber hides a new Secret..

Raised by snakes, he forgets that he is actually a boy...and then one day he accidentally wanders into a place known by humans as the "Forbidden Forest".
