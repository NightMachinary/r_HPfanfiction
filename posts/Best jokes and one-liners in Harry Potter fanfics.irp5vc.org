  At breakfast the next morning, Harry waved Luna Lovegood over. She sat next to him, and Harry dropped his wisdom on her.

  Harry said, "If you want to do well, first, you should get plenty of detentions. Not for Potions, his detentions are just scrubbing cauldrons and writing lines, which is a waste of time, but Charms and Transfiguration detentions are great. You can get tutored a lot."

  Harry Potter is a geek, a nerd, a total dork whose favorite hobby is "transfiguring stuff." He doesn't understand what rules are, has no social skills, is barely sentient, and is very smart.

** Some of the humor in A Black Comedy hasn't aged entirely gracefully, but one line in particular still makes me giggle a bit:

"Fuck you all very much. And your mother twice."

And in a broader sense, the consistent use of the term "that fucker" to refer to the unknown person messing with Voldemort's plans.

** It's a little long but bear with me:

#+begin_quote
  When nothing happened to Hagrid or Buckbeak, Malfoy threw a fit. And, because Harry was the reason his whole plot to ruin Hagrid failed, he aimed all of his animosity in Harry's direction.

  In Potions, he set up next to Harry's cauldron for the first time since ever, and proceeded to whinge and moan about how his arm hurt too much to do the necessary cutting. And what happened? Snape made Harry handle all of Malfoy's ingredients. "Potter, you will help Mr. Malfoy until I tell you to stop."

  Okay then. Snape's favouritism of the prat would end up being unpleasant for all involved. Apparently Snape forgot how literally Harry could take orders.

  So while he was cutting and slicing and mincing, Malfoy made dumb comments here and there, with Harry absent-mindedly nodding along.

  After class, instead of following Hermione, he followed Malfoy. He took up Malfoy's bag, making the blond sputter in confusion. "What the hell, Potter?"

  Harry sent him a sweet smile and said in a kind voice that certainly carried quite a ways down the corridor, "Since you have been invalided so unfortunately, you can't possibly carry your own bag any longer, Malfoy. And Professor Snape did say I'd have to help you until he told me to stop. Do you need to use the loo before we go to your next class? As your dominant arm is so terribly injured, I'll do my best to wipe you properly."

  Every student within hearing distance - who were all listening in even if they tried to pretend they weren't - turned away to laugh among themselves. Some even pointed at Malfoy while they and the bookends passed.

  The blond's face became even more pinched than usual and turned an ugly shade of red. He did not have the skin tone for such a colour. Something he shared with Ronald Weasley, sadly.

  Harry proceeded to follow Malfoy around all morning and as he couldn't use his wand, as that would prove that he was a liar and a fake, he had to endure Harry's attentions. And Harry went /everywhere/ he went. So close in fact that the other teen refused to go to the bathroom for fear of what Harry was willing to do.

  At lunch, he patted the boy's head condescendingly and plated his food for him. And instead of letting Malfoy feed himself, Harry did that too, holding the fork and the spoon and cooing every time he ate another bite.

  "Potter, what are you doing?" Snape demanded, finally coming over to the table to see what was going on.

  Harry beamed at the man. "I'm doing exactly as you told me, sir!"

  "Speak sense, boy!"

  "But sir," said Harry with a look of total confusion that made him appear perfectly innocent, "you said in Potions class, that I had to help Malfoy until you said to stop. I took this as an order to follow him around and be his replacement arm since he can't write his assignments, cut his ingredients, use his own utensils, wipe himself, or wash himself without assistance. He's practically been rendered powerless in this place, sir! We can't just leave the disabled to suffer without aid, and I thought it was very nice of you to suggest such a thing as helping him out! I hope we can make things more accessible for /all/ disabled people from now on."

  What if, when Petunia Dursley found a little boy on her front doorstep, she took him in? Not into the cupboard under the stairs, not into a twisted childhood of tarnished worth and neglect---what if she took him in?Petunia was jealous, selfish and vicious. We will not pretend she wasn't. She looked at that boy on her doorstep and thought about her Dudders, barely a month older than this boy. She looked at his eyes and her stomach turned over and over. (Severus Snape saved Harry's life for his eyes. Let's have Petunia save it despite them).Let's tell a story where Petunia Dursley found a baby boy on her doorstep and hated his eyes---she hated them. She took him in and fed him and changed him and got him his shots, and she hated his eyes up until the day she looked at the boy and saw her nephew, not her sister's shadow. When Harry was two and Vernon Dursley bought Dudley a toy car and Harry a fast food meal with a toy with parts he could choke on Petunia packed her things and got a divorce.

** From linkffn(13230340) Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay, when Harry asks what it means for Dumbledore being a Grand Sorcerer

#+begin_quote
  Harry tilted his head in anticipation, and Dumbledore winked at him before continuing. "One possibility is that it simply means that I am quite good at magic. While another is that it means I have created a Sorcerer's Stone."

  "What's a Sorcerer's Stone?" Harry asked.

  "I don't have the faintest idea," Dumbledore replied. "I believe that our cousins across the Atlantic may know, but I would not care to guess -- that is surely for them to tell."
#+end_quote

When Harry is being defamed by Daily Prophet and asked Snape for wisdom

#+begin_quote
  "Professor McGonagall is correct," he said. "The Headmaster will doubtless be doing what he can in his own way. Aside from that, perhaps you could cancel your newspaper subscription?"

  "I don't have one," Harry replied.

  Professor Snape did the looking-at-Harry-carefully thing for about another thirty seconds. "You... don't have a subscription? Then what is the problem, boy?"

  "Well, Draco pointed it out to me," Harry explained. "And now Neville has a subscription to keep track of what's going on, and it all makes me really uncomfortable. I'd much rather graduate Hogwarts without being noticed much."

  ...

  "Subscribe to the Quibbler," Professor Snape told him bluntly. "Doubtless if you use that paper as your source of information you will soon forget all about this whole business."
#+end_quote

When Dumbledore wants to celebrate

#+begin_quote
  He turned to Harry, and spoke more quietly. "After all that, I'm quite peckish. Shall we have some Muggle food to celebrate? I've heard good things about a Scottish chef not far from here."

  ...

  Harry took a bite out of his own McDonalds burger, not bothering to remove the wrapping first.

  "I think maybe the family was Scottish, originally, of the person who started it. But it's an American company," he told the much older wizard. "And there's loads of them, they're all over the place. I think they're supposed to be in half the countries in the world."

The fic is full of jokes like that, yet it's also wholesome.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  Everything changes the summer of 5th year when a mere letter causes Harry's magic to react wildly and he finds out that Dumbledore has been controlling him and his friends a lot more than first thought. With the truth revealed to him, Harry shows everyone he isn't the Gryffindor Golden Boy everyone thinks he is and he isn't the only the one with masks. DarkEvilTrio! SLASH

  The summer prior to 6th year Harry deals with Tom in a decisive, if accidental manner. That summer Harry gets a girl friend in Susan Bones, and sets about some self improvement. It is after this change to himself he discovers something a bit disturbing about the Wizarding World, something that Hermione Granger is determined to use to her advantage.

** "Aliens are fictional beings that are not born on this planet, Ron," she explained, throwing a stern glance at Harry. "They are generally assumed to be non-human, and Muggles have often depicted them as short green men with large black eyes and telepathic abilities."

Harry snorted. "Those are Martians," he threw in helpfully, ignoring Hermione's vicious glare, "and they're actually quite tall with red eyes."
