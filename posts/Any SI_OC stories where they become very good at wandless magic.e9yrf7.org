Also i'd prefer stories that have at least gotten further than first year, but aren't hundreds of thousands of words just to get past first year. I've seen great stories that have been bogged down by things that matter very little, if at all, to the story, and making first year take 500k+ words. I want a story of good length obviously, but not so much that after describing a spell, it's history, and everything that you end up forgetting the story.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** Alexandra Quick has a fair amount of wandless magic. It's a really well built out world with great stories - book 5 is complete and being released twice a week at the moment.
