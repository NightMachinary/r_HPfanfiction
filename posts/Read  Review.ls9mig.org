Give me your *first chapter* of your long fic or a *one shot,* anything goes!

Any pairing, any AU, have at me with your fics!

If you want your review privately sent let me know in your comment

I will be honest but if you want me to focus on something like grammar, tone or such let me know as well.

Edit: I will get started on some more tomorrow!

Edit 2: Don't despair I promise to continue reading, it just takes some time as I am the mom of a snuggly 1 year old!

** I feel like this is one of my weaker fics, and that my beta readers may not have been ruthless enough, especially on my characterization of Snape. It's a short post-war romance, but he's still just a bit of a snarly git. The prompt I wrote it for was "candlelit dinner" in a Valentine fest, so I focused a lot on the immersive magical mood and not so much the plot.

A review of Chapter 1 would be fab, thanks! Only proceed to Chapter 3 if you want the smutty ending ;)

*Summary:* By all rights, the story of Holly Potter and Alex Kann should have ended when they parted ways at age 11. Their destinies lay in different worlds: witch and Muggle; magic and science; Scotland and London. Then Alex came up with the idea of selling potions to Muggles. Their waning bond is revived, but can it last while running a nascent illegal business, the challenges of school and new relationships? Fem!Harry, Time-shifted AU, Pre-Hogwarts, Years 2-4.

Honestly, the fic really starts in chapter 3 (the first chapter after the two chapter prologue, the summer after first year). The prologue is basically filler.

** [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/clanky/drafts/brother_and_sister.html]]

post-DoM summer, where Harry decides to do things otherwise than expected and be more active, but NO super!Harry, his struggle is that the power of love is actually his leadership and trust of others willing to be lead by him. Also, there is a twist: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/bevfuu/lf_harry_ginny_are_brother_and_sister/][it turns out]] that Harry and Ginny are actually brother and sister. It has two consequences, only which matters for my story: suddenly Harry finds himself in the position of taking care of somebody else, which pushes him to be much more serious about his life and survival (don't even think about the incestuous relationship!). The only romantic content is that both Harry and Ginny admit to one another they had some thoughts about the other, but now they are standing over the wreckage of those dreams and they have to start fresh again. Good Dumbledore, but overwhelmed and with an open issues, whether there is some kind of outset of Altzheimer or something of that kind. Subplot is return of Petunia Dursley to the fringes of the magical world after death of Vernon.

Strictly PG-13 (perhaps some swearing appropriate to teenagers, some violence, but nothing too overwhelming, I hope).

Written in the form of a script. Highly unfinished, in the middle of rewrite.

*** I do like the script idea. It's helpful that it is already established. I can picture the characters and familiar places in my head. I really like that you included Ginny had been to St. Mungos before. I feel like that is a very skipped over thing in Ginny's development I read until it started to get unformatted. Overall I think you have a very good pace considering it is in script form. I feel like some of Harry's dialogue is a bit mature for him but if your wanting him to be more active that makes sense

The premise is interesting. I hope you keep to the idea of a more active but not over powered Harry. I hope you keep up with writing, and post when you've gotten through the rewrite.

**** Thank you very much. And don't worry about OP!Harry, that is truly my personal enemy. Neither of two Death Eaters-like persons overpowered in this story are done by somebody else than Harry.

1. Ginny: she remembered from their DA trainings, that Harry was telling them not to be concerned about number of spells to use, but use those they know well effectively. So, she knew her best offensive spell is /Reducto/ (or /Confringo/? is it just a film/book difference or there are two almost same Blasting Curses? Whatever, for the canonical example see her performance in Battle of DoM just couple of days before), so she closed her eyes, and sent all she had into one giantic Blasting Curse against the Death Eater, who was in the moment distracted by battling both Harry and a Disillusioned Auror (Tonks, in fact). Ginny didn't hit his torso (as planned), but clearly cut off his hand, which in the end was enough (he died from shock/blood loss in couple of minutes).

2. Dudley: not super intelligent but very pureblood Death Eater didn't expect anything from an unarmed Muggle. Dudley however spent last year training his boxing and being very close to his target he hit him before the wizard could do anything. One strong punch to head was apparently enough to make the wizard unconscious.

Both actions carefully designed so that they are possible with the equipment they already have.

** Hello,

If you are interested I have a series of interconnected stories (mostly one-shots) culminating into my current chaptered story: 'The Purpose of Wings.' I'd be grateful to hear thoughts on pacing and tone. Insight into voice and organic character interactions would be similarly helpful. This is a lovely thing to offer, much appreciated!

** I'm reframing the Harry Potter series. I'm changing Tom Riddle's backstory from the canon so his life parallels Harry's but maintains aspects of the canon. Pairing is Tom/Harry (no Harrymort here).

Not sure what you consider the first chapter for this, but I have a short prologue for “chapter 1,” and “chapter 2” is the real chapter 1.

Feel free to comment on whatever you want! 🙂

It's a between the wars, Auror thriller/murder mystery WIP. Canon compliant but with a manipulative Dumbledore. Lots of Charlie, Moody, Tonks, and OCs.
