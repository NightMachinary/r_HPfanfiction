  AU of PoA. Harry wakes in the night to a voice calling him from somewhere in the castle---and when he follows it, everything changes. Updated every Friday.

  #+begin_example
      This is a canon\-divergent AU that starts after Chapter 7 of Prisoner of Azkaban\. It will probably run to at least the mid\-point of The Half\-Blood Prince\. It will also be long\.The title is based on a quote from the Book of Job: “I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls\.”

**** I think its good, that why i rec. it. ;) I guess it depends on what you're looking for - don't read it for the romance that's slow coming as Harry is like 13-14. I like the bond to his Basilisk and how it is portraied though, that it is trying to help him but is still not a substitute for an adult. The writing style is not everyones thing I guess. Read it if you like Slytherin-ish Harry (and conflicted about that), Mentor Snape and the wizarding world getting a bit of a wakeup call I guess. It's long, ongoing and regulalry updated - what more could you ask for? ;)

** How major? I can try and hunt down one I've read where there was a special magic that could only be used by parselmouths, it /may/ have been a 'Snape raising/mentoring Harry'. But it might take a while since that's literally all I remember Lol

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

  In an alternate universe where there was no wizarding war and his mother was a pure-blood witch, Harry James Potter discovers he is one of the not uncommon children able to talk to snakes, but why does that make his father so sad?
