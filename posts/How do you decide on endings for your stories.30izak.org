And how do you make the endings of different stories generally different from each other?

My mind has a tendency to want to end everything "they paired off and lived happily ever after".

Actually, I think my mind doesn't do endings in general, because of the fics I read, most are unfinished, and those that are finished, many of them I dislike the endings.

I want to write DX but I can't even finish my outlines


** By planning them ahead of time?

Part of the outline process should be knowing what themes you're hitting in the story - those themes should resonate throughout, and generally speaking it's a good idea to have your most important theme be heavily featured in your ending. JKR did that exceedingly well in canon.

In essence, the end of the book is where the main conflict is resolved. The way it's resolved should feel thematically consistent with the rest of the story. Example: if you've been showing how the good guys succeed because teamwork and trusting each other are really important, don't have the hero go lone-wolf rampage in the end - make the way he or she wins absolutely rely on friends, and trusting those friends to handle some important aspect of the plan.

It's honestly not that hard. I feel like too many people tend to go over the top with endings with a huge twist or something "epic" that ends up feeling like it's coming out of left field (because it is.) Endings don't have to be surprising, they have to be satisfying. Don't overthink it.

*** I mean in the planning process. I gave up on the idea of 'start writing and see what happens' a long time ago. But even when I'm planning a story, I end up with 'ok, main conflict resolved, romance established, life is peaceful...... Now what? That's it?'

I don't think I've ever felt the need to write a 'twist' ending, and I feel you about the ending being satisfying, but it honestly is that hard. For me, at least. I'm so much better at beginnings, but the endings end up all sounding the same /:

** First- this is a really good question.

Second- it really should be easy but most people can't tell what a good conclusion should look like. Your 'paired off and lived happily' ending is fine for a romance that starts with 'main character was lost, alone and felt doomed'. The beginning conditions should echo the ending state.

There are a couple stories out there that I feel get undeserved flack for not being complete even though they are. For example- lorddwar's Harry/Tonks classic '[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2567419/1/Harry-Potter-And-The-Summer-Of-Change][HP and the Summer of Change]]' starts with Harry grieving the death of Sirius, trying to find a way to fight his enemies and know more about what he can do with magic. He yearns to dump his childlike innocence and get into the game as it were. He's also seeking revenge against Bellatrix Lestrange. Suffice to say, all these issues get resolved by the end of that summer. I've seen people complain 'He never finished the story- Voldemort is still out there and he hasn't confronted Dumbledore or anything'; defeating Voldemort or confronting Dumbledore wasn't torquing him up, though. The story stands well where it stopped.

*** This was actually really useful, thank you! And you're right, I do find myself preferring endings that don't go 50yrs into the future with his grandchildren and death and whatever, writing out every last small detail. I guess the advice 'when all the problems introduced in the beginning are solved, you're done' should be more common sense, right? But it seems I'm long out of writing class. Thank you for the reminder =D

*** This is definitely true. One story I've had kicking around in my head for a while involves the Order chasing down a Harry who's never known he was a wizard, and the story ends with him finally agreeing to help them against Voldemort. The story of the story is the chase, the game of cat and mouse; fighting Voldemort is irrelevant to that, and to include that afterwards would be to the detriment of the story.

** Like [[/u/Lane_Anasazi]] says it's frequently decided in the outlining stage. That being said, it's hard to overstress the importance of editing in the creative process. While it's probably too late to add a major theme when you're editing, it's possible to have ideas germinate that become excellent plot points that become themes for later chapters - and even endings.

When crafting a theme, you can't look at in a vacuum. You have to also consider possible stressors to that theme. Using Lane's example of friendship/teamwork, things won't work perfectly all the time and you need to consider how each person operates within that team, how their separate motivations can add or resolve conflicts, and how outside influences can stress the team/friendship. Often times it is these stressors or outside influences that generate the most cogent ending possible.

Great question and I think it's a really good point to consider.

*** That's true =) but I'm more worried about not having an ending at all than an ending that's too rigid. Thank you for replying though :D
