No matter the fanfic, the Weasley twins are (almost) always a "package deal". You cannot have Fred without George, or vice versa, and you cannot have only one twin bashed.

Why, though? Even the most identical twins -- in personality and looks -- have differences; e.g. one is friendlier, the other is more ambitious etc. And think of the story potential! Imagine: an issue divides the Weasley twins, forcing them to grow as characters, in different ways to each other.

As the fandom has overall matured, there has thankfully been a drop in twin-speak and twin cliches, but I feel they are still quite prevalent. Why can't people separate the twins?


** Because canon treats them exactly the same way. They're a package deal. We don't see them have any notable differences of personality, appearance (until George loses an ear) or ideology. It is always them united against everyone else. No they don't speak like two halves of one person but they are very much treated like a single entity.

So in splitting them up you have to make up characterisation out of whole cloth but in what might be an unpopular way - splitting the twins up - and unless it's the focus of your story or in some way relevant to the plot it could feel like an unnecessary subplot.

This isn't strictly true. There's a fairly strong undercurrent of characterisation that paints Fred as slightly crueler and more malicious than George, and definitely more outgoing. Fred wants to blackmail Bagman, Fred drops the sweet that Dudley eats, Fred almost always speaks first and many other examples.

It's subtle, but it's there.

**** It is definitely there, but I'm pretty sure at some point JK said that she always thought of the twins as 'Fred and George' the package. All the differences seem to be subconscious on her part

***** Actually it was the opposite! Very intentional:

"Rowling has since described Fred's death as ‘the worst for me'. Incidentally, Fred was chosen to die over his twin George because he was the slightly more conspicuous brother.

‘Fred is normally the funnier but also the crueller of the two. So [readers] might have thought that George would be the more vulnerable one and, therefore, the one to die,' she once said."

*** And if you do so and still stay close to package deal from canon it would require time, because differences will be way below the surface and will need 1) POV talking 1-1 with them 2) A serious conversation they so intensely avoid

** We never see them separately in the books, as several people have already stated.

That said, my headcanon is that their minimal OWLs (three each) were in different subjects--- that they DECIDED that only one of them would get good grades each subject. (Also, that they deliberately got a low number of OWLs to make sure they wouldn't qualify for any of the Ministry jobs their mother wanted them to seek.)

** I'd love to see a take where they only act like this in public to annoy other people, the twinspeak, swapping places, etc. It started when they were because people and thier family kept confusing which twin was which. But in private, or whenever things got really serious they act like they are actually two separate people and they have conversations with each other or you notice that the personalities aren't exactly the same. Also while both are intelligent but inherently loose with school, they have different interest and skillsets. One is really god with potion ingredients, explosions, like getting dirty, is the more wild of the twins. The other other is more reserved, he prefers clean applications like charms and transfiguration, but doesn't mind getting dirty only if he needs to. Basically break them more into the thinker and the doer as individual aspects, the thinker realized what the mauraders map was and how to unlock it by throwing ideas back and forth with his twin. The doer took dungbombs to the next level and devised the portable swamp. Simply put they each have thier individual strengths and weaknesses, but together they pull off thier feats of magic.

** They speak in unison/complete each other's sentences so often in the books and movies that they have become one person. I imagine this is an issue for real identical twins with similar personalities. At my old job, I worked with a set of completely identical twins who were very, very different and some people legitimately thought they were the same person.
