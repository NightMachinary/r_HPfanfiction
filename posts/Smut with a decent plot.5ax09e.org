I'm looking to read a story that has smut (I'm expecting a sex scene at one point) with decent writing and plot. Hopefully something longer than 50k words. It doesn't have to be Harry, anyone really.

Please no m/m or harems. m/f and f/f is fine. Only one loyal pair. Thank you.


** Just dropping in to say a story with a good plot and descriptive sex scenes or sexual situations is not necessarily "smut". Smut implies a more porn-like story where the sex often overwhelms any plot.

I too am a fan of "mature" stories that actually include descriptive sex instead of dancing around it like its a contagious disease. Nothing pisses me off more then an author (I also write) who dumbs down their stories or censors material to aim for a lower rating or a broader audience. Sex is part of life.

I will have to look to see if I have anything that fits what you want, but unfortunately I cant think of any off the top of my head right now that are literally 1 loyal pair the entire story, or 50k+ words, although I know there are some and im sure others will post. You can try this one.

It doesnt exactly fit what you were talking about as its multiple pairs of people, but each pair is technically only with each other the entire time. I dont know if I would consider it the greatest of plots but its a fun read.

I mean, this is one of the main reasons I like reading fanfic.

No need to keep it sellable in the marketplace.

Children die, war is fucked up, rape happens, etc.

True. However even though people are not making money usually, they are still fishing for views and reviews. I don't blame them because exposure is important, but I have read so many stories that are hurt by authors restricting themselves at points in the plot because they don't want to have to slap an "M" rating on it or other such reasons.

Its definitely a balancing act for authors.

**** I mean sure. Bur you can write a story that has sex without describing all the stuff that happens during sex. Basically you can do a fade to black and that works just as well. In fact it works better than a bad dex scene. Seriusly if you have read some bad ones you know what im talking about.

*** Okay, I'll repeat my request.

1. No m/m (meaning no Draco x Harry) for example.
2. No harems (many girls are having sex with the protagonist within the same month for example). *I would prefer one loyal pairing, such as Harry x Hermoine to last until the end of the series. Think one true love.*
3. Decent plot (meaning that the story is more important than the smut, but the sex scenes, for example, are pretty good and detailed, and are not age restricted to a middle schooler).

To sum it up... I'm tired of reading smut without there being a plot, and I'm tired of reading amazing stories that are trying to avoid being detailed in their sex scenes.

** Since you mentioned you didn't like older guy/younger girl all I've got leftover in my calibre library is Hermione/Draco.

linkffn(6725154) - Though Draco has a sexual history, so not first time for both/true love/soulmates sort of thing.

linkffn(11153333) - ShayaLonnie doesn't back down from graphic sex scenes, but I know she was in the process of editing them down for FFnet's rating. She hasn't posted this one on Ao3 yet, so I think it's still the uncensored version

[[http://sinful-dreams.com/unicorn/fic/viewstory.php?sid=15][Through the Eyes of a Child]] - Fluffly, Creature fic. There is a homosexual couple but I don't think there was an explicit sex scene between them

--------------

The following three are Time Travel fics where Hermione is about the same age as the previous generation.

linkffn(8311387) - Hermione/Sirius - soulmates story, the sex scene(s?) are sort of abstract, but they are there

linkffn(11494764) - Hermione/James - it's ShayaLonnie again, so I'm sure there were sex scenes, though I can't remember any -- Many of Shaya's stories have great plots with mature content, Safe Word's Devil's Snape is bound to be good, though I haven't read it so I'm not officially recommending it

linkffn(8751734) - Hermione/Severus

*** Hmm.... I don't mind you recommending me older male / younger female, just no Snape/Voldemort (tom riddle is fine!).

I'll probably be looking closely at your first two recommendations.

Thanks!!

Edit: And now that I reread your comment, maybe you meant 'no Snape' as in you don't want him in the pairing at all? I'm not sure.

  ((originally posted elsewhere as "Bride of the Potions Professor")) Sometimes all it takes to change the world is one small, simple choice. On the night the Death Eaters attack Hogwarts, Hermione Granger makes such a choice. Her life---and her world---will never be the same.The guilt from killing Draco is bad enough, and knowing she saved Dumbledore doesn't help it, but when a Ministry decree forces her to marry Professor Snape---a cruel, cold man who's apparently hated her since she was a child---in order to be used as a breeder of superior wizards, Hermione doesn't think her life can get any worse. But, of course, she's wrong.Soon, Voldemort's after her and her friends (again), her life is in grave peril, and all her hopes for a future at all, much less a happy one, rest on her own shoulders---and on Snape, her unwanted husband, whose heart still belongs to a woman long dead.
