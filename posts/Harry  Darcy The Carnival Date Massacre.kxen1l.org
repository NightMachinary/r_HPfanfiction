So I was reading the ch 25 update to Prince Haraldr by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/10079348/Lady-Marauders4][Lady Marauders4]] (amazing story, Marvel(Thor) + Avengers crossover) and the snarky side kick of Jane(thor's gf) takes harry out on a day date to the movies and for some reason I just wanted to see them go to a carnival where they flirt with each other the whole time and eventually monsters come out and everyone gets murdered. Sounded like a fun horror/romance one-shot that would have also fit in the story.

Harry & Darcy: the Carnival Date Massacre

Summery: Darcy takes the younger(alert!) brother of her best friend's boyfriend to the local carnival for a night of games and romance. Little does she know that her date is to short to ride all the rides and as they sneak into the house of mirrors something looks back that shouldn't be from midgard. The God & Sultry Pirate Talking Hussy pt.2 Available now!

why do I feel like I need this in my life now.
