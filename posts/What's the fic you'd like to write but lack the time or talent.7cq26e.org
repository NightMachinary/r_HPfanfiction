I guess many people here sometimes dream of writing a hugely over-ambitious story. For example I'd like to write a next-generation story dealing with the problem of maintaining the statute of secrecy in the era of the internet and digital media in the muggle world, forcing wizards to endure increasingly strict secrecy measures. As a result, the magical community gets split into three factions. One trying to maintain the existing status quo, one campaigning for a peaceful gradual reveal of magic and the third being a resurge of Grindelwald's ideology of wizards as a ruling class.

Of course, this split would also go through the extended Weasley family, and the story would have to deal with topics such as radicalization and political divisions within a family. Sadly I realize that I'm not nearly good enough a writer to realize such a story.


** Voldemorts horcruxes try to revive him right away when he dies after the rebounding AK. But it turns out that making multiple horcruxes doesn't mean "Harder to hunt them all down so better immortality." It actually means "None of the horcruxes actually have the power and data to rebuild what was lost".

It's a good thing one of them is attached to a perfectly good template of what a human body/mind/soul is. The horcrux in harry's scar happily sends along the infotmation from it's host, and all the horcruxes use it to fill in the rather significant gaps, possibly along with some magic from the artifact they were originally placed in.

Queue a number of rather... varied harry's coming into existance.\\
1. Diadem spawns a child who grows up in the pseudo-reality of the RoR.\\
2. Diary surprises the Malfoy's by spawning a child, obviously a heir to the dark lord.\\
3. Helga's Cup spawns a child that probably dies alone in a vault. Or gets raised by goblins.\\
4.Slytherin's Locket spawns a child in the Black Household.\\
etc...

It could be crack or serious, but definitely many shenanigans on the train, and Hogwarts, and Snape probably has an aneurysm on the first day of school, as he sees at least 4 potters arrive at the school. Ideally one for each house, posssibly 2 in some (slytherin can have 2, Harry Malfoy and Harry Black).

But I lack the time, and probably talent to write a good story out of it.

*** That would actually be pretty cool. I'd like to read that, especially the child growing up in the pseudo-reality of the RoR.

I once started writing a similar, but darker story where, after CoS, the other four horcruxes all possessed people and spawned copies of Tom who plotted to take over the world together, but I dropped it when I realized I had no idea where to go with it after about Chapter 6.

** Combination of a number of different plot bunnies into a single AU world:

We start off with elements from Lords of Magic:

- Certain very rare wizards are born with magic which is qualitatively different from other wizards, making them significantly more magical beings. This does not just mean that their spells are stronger, it means that they have a greater connection to magic more generally e.g. superior magical instincts and senses. These wizards are known as Lords and Ladies.

- Wizards discovered how to use transfiguration to make themselves immortal around 800AD, but it is an extremely rare wizard who is talented enough with transfiguration to do it.

- The wizarding population is significantly larger than in canon due to many wizards never dying (either because they are deaged by others or because they can do it themselves). Immortality caused population controls to be put in place by magical governments.

- Due to the combination of the above factors, the politics of wizarding society is dominated by the rare Lords and Ladies, many of whom are famous historical wizards from canon, around whom other wizards cluster as a kind of court.

But now we veer off into new territory:

- The International Statute of Secrecy was never passed.

- All over the world, wizards actively and openly interfere in Muggle government (or rather, since there is no separation, simply THE government). In Britain this occurs to the extent that the political class is almost entirely the same as the magical elite. There are very few Muggles who occupy the top level of society. The wizarding elite rule the Muggle world directly, both politically and financially.

- Despite this, wizarding inequality remains - there are still poor wizards, though they're doing better than poor Muggles.

- The British Empire remains in full swing.

- Honour duels are still permitted.

- Technology has taken a different direction to the real world. The most notable absences are the lack of widespread electrification and the lack of development of rocketry (also no nuclear weapons). The industrial revolution still took place (with a magical twist) and there is a generally steampunky feel to technology. But it's not all bad news for Muggles: the proliferation of magical items for Muggle use has resulted in some novel technologies the modern Muggle world lacks, especially in the areas of medicine, transportation, and "magical AI".

- AIR SHIPS.

- As the wizarding elite became more and more embedded in the rule of the Muggle world, so too did they become more and more wedded to physical locations, and in particular London. As such, wizarding power and wealth have concentrated in London, and along with it so too has demand for local magical services.

- Over the years, magical theory becomes ever more complex as further advances are made. On top of this, new areas of magical study are developing relating to the use of magic in ways that did not occur in canon e.g. magical engineering, magic on the mass scale. These factors have resulted in a growing demand for magical tertiary education.

- The combination of the above two factors resulted, in the mid 1800s, in the founding of the Westminster College of the Magical Arts. It serves largely the children of the magical elite i.e. Hogwarts students.

- The Potter family are not part of the magical elite, but are rather solidly magical middle class (which still corresponds to a pretty high level of privilege, but which still means a large gulf separates them from the empire-spanning titans of commerce who occupy the top levels of society).

- Tom Riddle is a young Lord who promotes that wizards return to the "old ways" where they are less focused on industry and material wealth and more focused on individual magical achievement. He bemoans the impact the Muggle world has had on wizarding life and feels like wizards have lost their way, steadily making themselves more and more like Muggles and losing touch with their magic. He wishes to enact a separation between wizards and Muggles where wizards create their own society based entirely around magic and they leave the Muggles to their squalor and dirt. He promotes this cause through political means but of course uses plenty of underhand, illegal and immoral tactics. Many of the wizarding young and poor - those who are disadvantaged by the structure of wizarding society - flock to his cause. No "Voldemort", no civil war (except in the form of murders and disappearances).

- James Potter foolishly challenged Tom Riddle to an honour duel and was killed in that duel. Harry and his younger sister are raised by Lily.

- Harry does not attend Hogwarts, which is beyond his family's means, but he attends a decent school and achieves excellent grades, considered by all his teachers to be a magical talent. He is therefore able to secure a place at Westminster College, where he will rub shoulders with the magical elite.

- The story opens as Harry, age 18 and already accomplished in the magical arts, starts at Westminster College.

The focus of the story is largely political/social/relationship based, tracking:

- Harry's friendships and relationships at college, including a romance with Daphne Greengrass, someone who is socially completely out of his league.

- How he goes from being an outsider to beginning to break into the social circles of the magical elite.

- How he begins to attract the attention of both Tom Riddle and Albus Dumbledore due to his rapidly growing magical talents.

- The mystery of what led James Potter to challenge Tom Riddle to a duel, and Harry's potentially misguided desire for revenge.

*** Given apparition and portkeys, would wizards really be wedded to physical locations? Perhaps they might have buildings located in some major cities, but there doesn't seem to be a need to be "wedded" to a location. Certain cities becoming seats of political power seems mostly based around the value of having goods and services nearby, and the need for close proximity for frequent political meetings and social activity. None of those three criteria really hold water for wizards, who are instead free to live and work where ever they want.

**** There's a concept - I think it actually exists in canon - that basically has it that having a physical central location of power for government actually builds up their magical abilities, granting them more power than they would otherwise have.

I think the Ministry in canon can set taboos, and Voldemort may have used his authority with the Ministry at the end to help penetrate Hogwarts' security.

This would be a heavy incentive for the magic users to form a centralized physical location for their government and whatnot.

I wonder how you would deal with the ever increasing Lords and Ladies. I assume that they all have the skill/resources to make themselves immortal so over time there would be more and more, unless they get killed off somehow.

Deadly politics maybe?

Or maybe it just isn't a problem yet with how rare they are and that the immortality method only became available in 800 AD.

So maybe if there was a story like this that would be made as a draft on ffn and then everyone can go see it , make commets and then it can be rewritten to everyone's demands, publish the final version and then see it rise to take the first place on ffn beating the infamous Nightmares of future past. I mean this is a fanfic that should not be rushed so taking time to write it should not be a problem especially since ti could be really good if lots of people contribute a small bit each, then again its up to the creator, you.

** For a long time, I wanted to write a fic that was a very AU take that made the magical world more, well, magical. It was actually going to be a Harmony soul bond fic, but going a different direction from other fics of that type with a lot of other AU twists. Eventually, I decided I really didn't want to do another Hogwarts years rewrite, but some highlights were:

- Soul bonds are common enough that we see multiple bonded couples in the story, including Molly and Arthur.

- Occlumency and Legilimency are common. Some people can do either or both naturally, and couples who aren't bonded can use them to replicate many of the effects of a soul bond.

- Many canon and fanon abilities like Metamorphmagi, Animagi, polyglotism (e.g. Barty Crouch Sr speaking 200 languages), Parseltongue, animal communication, and aura reading are common enough that most wizards have at least one of them. And they are put to much greater use instead of being a gimmick that barely matters outside of one book.

- Magical tattoos and other body modification are easy to add and remove and are often used as a fashion statement. For example, Hermione's Polyjuice mishap starts a fad of both boys and girls transfiguring cat ears for themselves.

- Magic is used in all aspects of life, even where we don't see it much in canon, like food, and clothing. For example, as jinxes go in and out of style (as Remus describes in Book 6), students make a game out of creating charm bracelets where each "charm" is enchanted to block a specific jinx, as opposed to most jewelry being decorative.

** I've got one or two knocking around.

- A historical adaptation that tells an alternate story for the creation of the Statute of Secrecy, focused on a collection of magical OCs and their muggle counterparts on both sides of the English Civil Wars. In my head, the wizard community splits along the Parliamentarian/Royalist lines, but not because of politics, but because of differing beliefs of magic's place in society.

The Royalists, with their penchant for tradition and the pomp and circumstance of power, have held court wizards and witches for centuries as advisors to the King and his court, as have other European powers. However, their position has been steadily eroded since the formation of the Anglican Church by Henry VIII, and it reaches a head with the emergence of Puritanism - which is notably more intolerant of magic - in the 1600s.

The Royalist wizards - many of them noble and of aristocratic station, but also many of the magical rank-and-file - believe that supporting the King is the best chance for a secure future for magical society, which is backed up by the King's own word, through his designated liaison. The Parliamentarian wizards, on the other hand, are more closely following the trends of the muggle public at the time, and see the drastic changes being wrought by the collapse of support for the King as a crucial point from which to seclude magical society, and live in peace - they too have their own - in many cases grudging - assurances from the Parliamentarians that wizards will be granted land, treaties and protection from persecution (despite dissent in the more militant sectors of the Parliamentarian camp) and will be left alone following the successful conclusion of the war.

There is some politics involved too, notably that those on the Parliamentarian side also fear the King's abuse of power, and seek to use the freedom gained from his rule to build a fairer, self-sufficient magical society.

What would follow would likely be an epic account of the major events of the Civil Wars, with numerous historical characters - Cromwell, Charles I and others - being inserted throughout whilst the wizarding world struggles with what kind of future it wants for itself.

I dunno, I just always thought this would be a better reason to seclude society than "boo-hoo witch burnings" (which weren't even that much of a thing in Britain).

- My other idea is a lot vaguer at the moment, but I am actually putting it to paper - a detective story featuring a grizzled, embittered Harry, who is following the darkest case of his career (although he doesn't know it yet), to stop a deranged killer and in the process attempt to free himself from the Ministry intrigue that has plagued his life.

What starts as a - disturbing - murder investigation becomes a struggle against a power more terrible than Harry could ever have predicted, with the ultimate stakes.

But there are so many ideas! I'd like to write a Teddy Lupin at Hogwarts story; something set in the dark ages with Merlin; something with Hagrid as the main protagonist; a whole series of Tonks & Moody Auror mysteries ...

** Here's an AU for ya

World Building

- It is technically a crossover/fusion with Robert E. Howard's Kull of Atlantis/Conan of Cimmeria/Solomon Kane stories, though none of those characters are involved. There still exist relics and ruins from the Hyborean Age and older times, which are highly dangerous, even for the highly skilled with magic.

- Both Yggdrasil /and/ the Garden of Eden exist. Part of Dumbledore's fame is that he is literally the only person to ever survive attempting to unravel the magic guarding the Garden.

- The Earth is approximately 1.6 times larger than muggles believe. The extra 0.6 is virtually entirely magical.

- Therefore, while the number of Muggleblood is approximately the same as the number of Muggleborn in canon, they are a smaller proportion to account for the increased number of Purebloods and Half-bloods.

- The portions of the world that Muggles are completely oblivious to are the result of what was the first true attempt at using the Fidelius Charm, the largest attempting casting of the Fidelius Charm, and the worst (known) botching of the Fidelius Charm.

- This is a major portion of the reason why the Fidelius Charm, though relatively easily cast, is rarely used and distrusted.

- Hogwarts is the second oldest still-existing Academy of Magic in the world, and widely acknowledged as the greatest school in the world (though Durmstrang, Beauxbatons, the Valley of Ramses and the Gitche Gumee Islands have strong claims on that title).

- Each Hogwarts House has its own traditions.

- Gryffindor's practice swordplay as a way to teach discipline, and because Godric Gryffindor was part of a magical order that believed: Healthy Mind, Healthy Body, Healthy Magic.

- Hufflepuffs tend to join multiple different societies leading to a maze of loyalties that no outsider can ever figure out. Over 3 dozen non-Hufflepuff wizards and witches have tried and failed in the last 80 years.

- Slytherins have a powerful bureaucracy, with multiple positions available in each year, in order to teach diplomacy, nuance, innuendo, cunning and the importance of honoring your word.

- Hogwarts is the most premiere of Britannia's 7 magical academies.

- All Hogwarts students are required to study at least 3 years of Ancient Runes.

- All Hogwarts students, in order to truly leave Hogwarts and honestly call themselves a Hogwarts graduate must create their own magical artifact.

- Large-scale war as Muggles know it has not been present in the Wizarding World since the time when the oceans drank Atlantis.

- Horcruxes aren't immortality devices, but more akin to Sith Holocrons.

- The International Confederation of Warlocks is not a U.N. analogue, but a by-invitation-only society of the brightest minds and most powerful/skill wizards and witches. To be acknowledged as a Warlock is to be ceded an immense amount of international influence.

- Ancient Runes are not required for enchanting, but can be used by learning enchanters to help tie seemingly incompatible enchantments together and by expert enchanters in trying to develop new enchanted objects.

- Spellscribing does not require Arithmancy or Ancient Runes.

- 13% of wizards and witches have what is best described as magical synesthesia (inspired by [[/u/Ihateseatbelts][u/Ihateseatbelts]]' brilliant Wandsong, name pending on my version), a qualitatively different way of perceiving magic.

- Of that 13%, two thirds are charitably described as madder than every single hatter.

Story Elements

- Voldemort is D E A D dead.

- Chamber of Secrets does open, during 4th year. Attaining the Sword of Gryffindor has far more... long term and widespread magical and societal importance than seen in canon.

- Sirius Black is in a long-term, magically induced coma in the Janus Thickey Ward of The Blessed St. Mungo's.

- It is unclear whether the Betrayer of the Potters was Peter Pettigrew, Sirius Black or known werewolf Remus Lupin.

- Oct 18 1981 was the last time Remus Lupin was seen in Brittania, though rumors place him somewhere in the South Americas or Africa.

- No one knows who any of the Death Eaters were, except for the ones killed/captured

- Snape was still Dumbledore's spy, it just never became known.

- Lucius Malfoy started (in 1983) an organization whose purpose is to help integrate Mugglebloods into Wizarding Society, teaching them the traditions of the new culture to which they are now entering. They have been in charge of informing Muggleborns of magic and leading them to Diagon Alley/Platform 9 3/4 since 1985.

- While not a highly skilled or powerful wizard, Peter Pettigrew (before his disappearance in 1981) was a highly gifted researcher and the greatest alchemy prodigy in a century.

- Story begins at the start of Harry's Fifth Year at Hogwarts.

- Hermione is a Hufflepuff, and has had an on-again/off-again relationship with Draco Malfoy. During Year 5, is mostly a background character.

- Ron is still a Gryffindor and would be main cast. Skilled Diviner and wishes to apply his talents at Divination (which would be a different take than canon, blatantly ripping off elements from enembee, Rent-a-Hero and Forging the Sword) to cursebreaking, as inspired by his renowned brother Bill.

- Harry is also a Gryffindor. The story would mainly deal with him struggling with Drawing Gryffindor's Sword (and therefore becoming both newest Gryffin of Gryffindor but the youngest to ever survive The Drawing), being the 5th year prefect. Incredibly skilled at Dark Magic and Primal Magics.

- Harry receives a strange unsigned invitation to an old ruin deep in the Forbidden Forest...

- I already know what the last sentence of the trilogy would be. And it would piss people off, so much since there would never be a sequel series.

Maybe he accidentally reveals magic and SHIELD is on his ass, and after being unsuccessful, sends the Avengers. Whatever it is, I just want to see Harry fuck up all the Avengers, then go back to a peaceful life.

- A Bloodborne crossover where Harry and someone else end up in Bloodborne's world, the main focus being the interaction between the two characters over this fucked up world they've entered.

- A story like A Black Comedy in the respect of Harry & Sirius going around doing whatever the fuck they want, but not in an alternate world. I'm already outlining a story sorta like this, but I would rather not slow down my main story's update rate.

- Alternatively, the same as above but with Harry and Ron doing whatever the fuck they want, having adventures, sleeping with anyone, etc etc. There's not enough Harry/Ron bromance stories.

- Don't judge me: A romance with a time traveling Harry going back, making friends with Lily, Lily falling in love with Harry, then Harry's hesitant about it and tries to solve the problem by telling Lily the truth. Lily realizes she doesn't give a fuck, and Harry's hesitance/resistance slowly crumbles away eventually. They adopt an orphan.

- Harry and Dumbledore travel to an alternate universe. Or crossover. I've considered writing one with Dumbledore and Harry ending up in Middle Earth.

Essentially, this is a crossover where Molly Carpenter from the Dresden Files ends up at Hogwarts bearing one of the denarians. Dumbledore recognizes this, and immediately goes on high alert. This is the year Harry begins Hogwarts at Christmas time, and dark events begin to be set in motion. Molly starts at Hogwarts, for she has magical blood and Dumbledore wants to keep a very close eye on her. However, soon Quirrell and Voldemort find 29 pieces of silver in the forbidden forest, and set into motion a chain of events that could doom two worlds.

** I've always wanted to write a Xianxia version of Harry Potter.

Like take Chinese fantasy novels (I've only read the stuff available on wuxiaworld), and take some of those ideas (cultivation, traveling, massive casts that tend to rotate out) and fit Harry into it.

Another one is to write a crossover between HP/Justice League where Harry takes on the mantle of Doctor Fate. This would be near the end of the war, however, things in this story wouldn't be going nearly as well as they did in the books. This leads Harry to begrudgingly accept the helmet and his fate. The reason I haven't started this one is that I haven't decided where it will go after the final battle. I'm torn on the idea that Harry would end up staying as Fate or somehow escaping the position.

The final one that's been on my mind recently is a post LOTR's story where Harry is chosen at the time of his death to be the Istari that arrives in Middle Earth after the others leave at the beginning of the age of man. Time to spoil something I have no plans to write (at least for a long while)!! Since the Lord of the Rings/Similarion is an attempt to create a British mythology I wanted to make it so that Harry ends up being the one as the last Istari on Middle Earth to actually then establish a more mundane magical world. So it would be Harry viewing the end of the War of the Ring and then deciding how best to actually start the magical world. Will he start a school? Will he grab an apprentice? Will he simply travel around giving a few people magical skills that they can grow into and develop as they see fit? The world may never know (because this feels like a project that I am nowhere near ready to start).

** If I were a better writer, I'd probably do one where Harry becomes Headmaster of Hogwarts. He'd make a lot of changes, to make the school better. I always felt like Hogwarts was lacking when I read the series. I mean, there have to be more classes besides the standard ones we see in the books. There can't just be a set number of professions. The wizarding world is much like the muggle one. I've never heard of primary schools for wizards before the age of 11, or of universities after that. So why not have Hogwarts, if it is indeed supposed to be the top school in the UK, become the best school, for ALL ages. Primary all the way to university/mastery level.

** I do have some ideas...

- A huge epic adventure story starring Ron and Hermione, where they go through trials and tribulations and end up saving the world WITHOUT Harry. I'd have Harry either missing or otherwise out of commission (injured and bed-ridden, magical coma, just too busy with other pressing matters in another part of the world), and Ron and Hermione are the only ones who can save the day, and they have to do it without any kind of prophecy or destiny or "chosen one" stuff.
- Yet another "Harry goes back in time to relive his Hogwarts days" story, but with two important differences: One, Harry didn't WANT to go back in time and has no idea who sent him back. Two, thanks to the protections around Privet Drive he ends up possessing not his younger self, but a passing Muggle-born witch in her twenties. So now he has to deal with not only being back in time and trying to find out how to help his younger self and/or get back to his own time, but with being a woman as well.
- A fic starring Verity (the witch who works at Weasleys's Wizard Wheezes and has like one line of dialogue in the entire series) that reveals she's actually an undercover Muggle in hiding -- the twins are essentially hiding her from some Death Eater or other because she was a witness to something (haven't decided what).
- A parody of self-insert fanfics, where a huge Dumbledore-basher suddenly wakes up in Dumbledore's body. And decides to do everything that they insist Dumbledore SHOULD have done, only to have everything come crashing down around them, with tons of people including Harry dying, because it turns out that canon Dumbledore actually DID know what he was doing.

Oh, and then there's one that I'm actually hoping to write:

Massive AU story where the wizarding world is actually "the witching world" and witches outnumber wizards ten to one, and most of the characters that were male in canon are female here.

Yeah... I do admit that I took a little inspiration from the Firebird trilogy. Thing is, while I liked the concept of a predominantly female magical world and even the harem aspects (blame my old schoolgirl fantasy of being a harem girl), I did NOT like how Darth Marrs presented it. That fic, once you get past the impressive worldbuilding, reads both like a male sex fantasy AND like a misogynistic rant about how women totally use men. The "bonding" part is just... bleah. I don't know Darth Marrs, but he doesn't write girls well. (He's one of few writers that can make me outright HATE Luna, who is one of my favourite characters in canon.)

So, I thought, okay... how do I write an AU with a similar set-up, but which DIDN'T read like I hated my own gender?

I've done quite a bit of worldbuilding for this already (even done a number of one-on-one roleplays with people set in this AU, to get a feel for it)... the witching world would have a very different society set-up, and a lot of the characters would have very different roles.

Some highlights:

- Five Hogwarts houses instead of four. Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Slytherin and Hufflepuff are like canon, except they only take girls. All boys automatically go to the fifth house, Merlin.
- Merlin is the smallest, and newest house -- Hogwarts used to be an all-girls' school (all four Founders were women in this AU) with the few wizards in existence either being taught by their families or apprenticed to other wizards, but with the Statute of Secrecy in the late 1600s it was decided that boys should get a formal education as well. Hence the establishing of a fifth school house, for the boys.
- Harems and polygamy are the norm. As a result, there are fewer families, but the families that DO exist are much larger, with several mothers and siblings. Because of this, the terms "pure-blood" and "half-blood" aren't widely used; instead you're either "Muggle-born" or "Witch-born."
- Muggle-borns, coming from a society where men/boys are not rare, and monogamy is the norm, are generally thought of as "prudes." Hermione, who absolutely does NOT like the harem thing, has the reputation of a HUGE prude.
- Dumbledore is still male, still gay, and still hugely powerful, but not the Headmaster of Hogwarts. Instead, he's a London-based private investigator (with Hagrid as his assistant) who helps both witches and Muggles solve mysteries. He's also the head of the Order of the Phoenix, in this world a political group dedicated to help those who don't fit into the system of the witching world.
- Voldemort goes by "Tom Riddle" and is more of a revolutionary/terrorist than a Dark Lord. An asexual, he has no interest in the harems and wants to change the society of the witching world; he shares a lot of goals with Dumbledore but uses more extreme methods. Like Charles Xavier and Magneto.
- The Weasley family is much bigger, with Arthur Weasley, five wives, fourteen daughters, and one son.
- Lily Potter, being Muggle-born, didn't like the idea of harems, and so she managed to get handsome and popular James Potter to join her in a Muggle-style monogamous relationship. When Lily and James were killed by Tom Riddle and left their daughter Holly an orphan, they became a tale of warning that witch mothers tell their daughters: "Look at poor Holly Potter, having to grow up with the Muggles, just because Lily was selfish and didn't want to share her man! Now the poor girl doesn't have any mothers to take care of her!"

Annnnd a lot of other things, but this post is getting really long. :)

My idea was "Harry is missing or otherwise out of commission, so Ron and Hermione have to be the heroes and save the day" -- this looks more like "Harry starts Hogwarts late, and for years Ron, Hermione and everyone else have uselessly struggled, but now Harry The Chosen One is finally entering Hogwarts and everything will be different."

Part of the point of my idea was that Harry wouldn't be involved in the day-saving at ALL.

***** No, you seem to misunderstand that prompt. It basically showed Hermione and co were doing fine on their own at Hogwarts without Harry's involvement. They had created an effective paramilitary organization by themselves, and were suspicious of the hype around the Boy-Who-Lived. Harry and Sirius on the other hand, thought quite high of themselves and were dismissive of Hermione's “Gryffindor Grenadiers”.

The two sides would be not on good terms initially. I even have the feeling that Harry needed a few savings by the others to finally admit his own shortcomings. It's going to be a reversal of the usual 'Harry as the Knight in shining armor' trope.

****** Maybe so, but since the author claims it would be "probably Harry/Hermione" it already goes far away from my idea.

In fact it's kind of the exact opposite; The entire point of my idea was that Ron and Hermione were used to have Harry there to be the "hero" but now they have to manage WITHOUT him; no Boy Who Lived, no prophecy, no destiny, no special treatment, just two teenagers who have to get by and save the day purely with their own wits and courage.

In this fic they have managed without him off-screen, but now he's suddenly there, and that's just the opposite of what I want. I especially don't want any H/Hr to muddle up what was supposed to be a story of the sidekicks AWAY from Harry.

I could see the rare wizards being highly prized, but many witches simply bed muggle men for a child or two if they aren't inclined to join a harem. James Potter in this case may have been a squib and last of his line- aware of the magical world but not able to participate.

You may even make certain kinds of magic easier for men than women, to further explain how wizards end up privileged instead of second-class ('Really, the best thing for us is if you wizards stay untrained in magic and healthy for plenty of sex').

#+end_quote

Yep. That's pretty much what a lot of Muggle-born witches do. The people of the witching world have grown up with the idea that monogamy is silly and that a family consists of one father, several mothers and usually a number of sisters. So to the witch-born, the harems -- or "covens," because that was a good word even if I didn't like the Firebird trilogy as a story -- are just how things ARE. Monogamy is that weird thing that Muggles do. A lot of the socialising at Hogwarts consists of witches testing out whether are good enough friends that they could be in a coven together.

Muggle-borns are different. Muggle-borns spend their first eleven years in the Muggle world where monogamy is common, families are smaller, and boys are very common. (In fact, a lot of Muggle-born witches, who start Hogwarts at the age where boys and girls usually make a point of not interacting a lot, might just ignore the boys altogether, at first.) Since there are so few men, the polygamy is just a fact, but a lot of Muggle-borns find the practice too weird and just opt to go back to the Muggle world and find someone there. Since there are so many witches anyway, nobody stops them in doing so -- long as the Statute of Secrecy is kept.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I actually made the backstory for Lily and James. James wasn't a Squib, but Lily, who was Muggle-born did not want to share, managed to talk him into a "Muggle-style" monogamous relationship. This did NOT make Lily popular among the witches -- a lot of other witches had hoped to get a piece of rich and handsome James Potter -- but there is no law that says that men HAVE to be in a coven. It's just that it's EXCPECTED of them to do so, and any men who do not want to are seen as weirdoes and often get ostracised socially (Dumbledore and Tom Riddle both refused to start a coven, which is why Dumbledore in this universe is nowhere near as respected and accepted as canon Dumbledore).

Nah, that's too "Firebird Trilogy" for me. Wizards are no better, or worse, than witches. They're precious and "special" because there are so few of them, and a new wizard born is cause for great celebration... but though they get more privileges than the witches, they get less freedom and ultimately less power. In the witching world, all important positions in government and education belong to women, and men are discouraged from a lot of "dangerous" jobs because they're so few. Plus, in this world, wizards don't get flying lessons because "even Muggles knows that broomstick flying is for WITCHES."

So even if a wizard might be the center of a coven, and maybe even the master of the house... outside the homes, women rule.

  Lily and James were killed by Tom Riddle
#+end_quote

honestly, makes absolutely no sense to me. Details are probably left out but my concern is the fundamental ideas seem at odds, and, dare I say it, sound like a sort of on the rails thing (like stations of canon).

**** Yeah, the details were sort of left out.... to be a little more detailed:

Despite what his followers thought, Tom Riddle didn't ACTUALLY care about bettering witching society for anyone apart from himself. What he wanted was to be the most powerful person in the witching world, but being a man he had no real way of gaining power by working within the system. Hence, he gained followers by claiming to work for their betterment... the "goals" he shared with Dumbledore were really just what he saw as means to an end, and the end was that Tom Riddle should be the biggest, baddest bastard around. :)

The reason why he killed Lily and James is actually different from canon too, even if the result ended up similar... for one, in this version there's no prophecy and he wasn't particularly after Holly... what he DID want was to unite the Deathly Hallows, and he knew James and Lilly had one Hallow in their possession.

Tom Riddle in this AU doesn't go by "Voldemort" or "Dark Lord," he's more like a terrorist than anything. He also doesn't hide his Muggle heritage; it's actually part of a point of pride with him that he spent his first few years in the Muggle world and "learned better."

Hope it makes a little more sense now?

So you're going for marriages instead of hiring cis men and trans women to donate sperm? Or going to the Muggle world and snagging a one-night stand there? You aren't going to have a magical means for getting pregnant without a person with a penis (such as Polyjuice Potion)?

In our world, we need a little more than two births per uterus-haver (cis woman or trans man or intersex person with functioning ovaries etc) to keep our population stable. With a 10:1 ratio of uterus-havers to penis-havers, it's only about 1.1 births each. In this example, each capable person is bearing three children. This means population growth. Have you decided what effects that is having? The effects on the blood purity movement when you can simply out-breed those with impure blood? Or is there a cultural norm for having fewer children that the Weasley family is violating?

How do family lines work? Ambilineal might make sense -- you follow the family line for the parent matching your gender. Matrilineal probably works better. You might have two families: your nuclear family, consisting of your father and one or more mothers commonly, which might have its own name and coat of arms and house; and your clan, where you're in the same clan as the one who bore you, which has a name and coat of arms and hierarchy and all that.

Wow, It's been a while since I read the Firebird Trilogy (that is, I gave up after the first story) but I remembered the worldbuilding beuing much better thought-out than that. I just hated the entire "Bonding" thing.

While I imagine (partly thanks to those roleplays) that the witching world is a more openly sexual society than the wizarding world (STDs aren't really a problem when you can heal or hinder them magically, same with unwanted pregnancies), it DEFINITELY won't be to the point where eleven-year-olds engage in sexual banter. Kids are still KIDS.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Sure, you could do that if you want. Part of the idea with me is that the harems/covens are entirely voluntary and not something you are forced into. Lots of witches choose not to join a coven, and that's viewed as perfectly acceptable -- it means one less woman for the competition. It's also why lesbianism is completely accepted in this world... male homosexuality. however, carries a HUGE stigma, because one less MAN for the system is a much bigger deal.

Dumbledore is still gay in this world, and refused any harems. As a result he's ostracised. (Same with Hagrid, who as a half-giant was not really for the covens and didn't really want one either.) Of course, Dumbledore is still Dumbledore, and a really damn powerful wizard. He's more on the outskirts of wizarding society, helping those who don't fit in. So he has a lot of friends and allies -- but they tend to be the outcasts. Squibs, half-breeds, people with different sexualities and so on.

Sperm donors and surrogates are quite acceptable, but not done terribly often because the Witching World isn't quite up to speed with such newfangled Muggle ideas.

As for transpeople... I've given that some thought, and I think that the witching world as a whole would generally not be too fond of them, but transitioning would be much easier thanks to magic.

I'm actually envisioning that one of the Weasley daughters, Jackie (a year younger than Ginny) was actually born male but already as a baby began using uncontrolled magic to make herself look more like a girl. While a lot of families would not have accepted this of their son, the Weasleys did -- and Jack Weasley was renamed Jackie and was put on potions that would transform her physical sex. By the time she started Hogwarts she was completely female, and most of the other families don't know she wasn't born that way.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I'm thinking that Polyjuice Potion and similat magical solutions might give you a functioning dick, but not a fertile one.

In any way, the witching world aren't a breeding program or anything; there's no law that says that you HAVE to have a child, and there's no law that says you HAVE to join a coven. It's just what "everyone" does.

#+end_quote

There aren't any laws or rules for how many children you can or can't have, but the Weasleys are a special case. Most covens have many fewer children, like one or two children per woman...

...but I wanted to keep the Weasleys as a family that was notably large, the way they are in canon. But in a world where you get several wives for every husband, seven children wouldn't seem that out of the ordinary -- so I just decided that Arthur was super-fertile and had fifteen children with his five wives. There, you get a Weasley family that are really numerous even for this world!

"Blood purity" isn't a very known concept in this AU, partly for the reasons you mention here. Nobody really cares whether you're "pure-blood" or "half-blood" or how many wizard ancestors you have... yes, there are some old families that have built up a lot of money and prestige (the Blacks and the Malfoys, for instance) but there's no real "pure-blood class."

In this world, what people are interested in is whether you are Muggle-born or witch-born... and that has to do with how you grow up more than anything. If you're witch-born, you grow up in a harem, with several mothers and sisters, you learn that this is the right and proper thing, and you learn the social codes and ruies of the witching world. If you're Muggle-born you grow up with weird ideas like how boys aren't special, or families are supposed to only be one mother and one father, and so on.

In this world, the insulting word for "Muggle-born" isn't "Mudblood," it's "Prude."

#+end_quote

They're actually patrilineal; the coven and its children take the names of the father. (There is a sort of stereotype here that the father is the master of the house and the focal point of the coven, but outside said house he doesn't have much power; women rule the society pretty firmly.) This is just one of the old traditions; the man gives the name to the coven. Since not every coven gets a son, this is one reason why there are fewer family names; some of the names just sort of ended when there were no boys to take them over.

An example is the Longbottom family -- in this AU, Frank Longbottom was actually a woman named "Francine." She and Alice both married Arthur and became part of the Weasley family... hence in this world Neville Longbottom is in fact "Nella Weasley," daughter of Arthur and Alice, and the Longbottom line has effectively come to an end.

As a result, since it's accepted that family names might end with one generations, there aren't really any coat of arms or family hierarchies or things like that. It's still not uncommon to trace your ancestors; being descended from some important witch or wizard is still a point of pride. But names will change, and most witches accept this.

There are a couple of exceptions: The Malfoys and the Blacks are old witching families who stayed because they always had at least one son... however the Malfoys have some problems here. Lucius Malfoy and his five wives have only managed to have one child, a daughter named Dracaena. (They were so certain the child would be a boy that they already picked the name "Draco," and then when it turned out to be a girl they changed it to the nearest female equivalent they could find.)

Dracaena is something so rare as a witch-born only child; usually if you are witch-born you have at least a couple of sisters, but Dracaena has had the sole attention of six parents for years and is INCREDIBLY spoiled. The Malfoys are still hoping and trying for a son, but so far it looks like the Malfoy line will end with Lucius.

This hasn't really improved their relationship to the Weasleys, who have a son... and who even had TWO sons (a rarity in a coven and usually a point of immense pride) but allowed one of them to become a daughter instead. This is not something the Malfoys would ever have allowed, and has just cemented their opinion that the Weasleys are either crazy or idiots, probably both.

** Ron is a ten year old chess genius. He feels overshadowed by his brothers, but /wants/ to be great.

He is literally one attitude shift away from being an unstoppable Slytherin.

I'd like a fic where Ron's ambition is sparked by meeting Harry and Draco. Ron sees how shortsighted Draco is, and how completely naive Harry is. He realizes that if these are his contemporaries, he might have a shot at being a great and famous wizard.

He proceeds to be sorted into Slytherin, to the shock of his family. He immediately begins implementing long term plans... cozying up with professors and other students. He incites Draco and other Slytherins in the Rememberall incident, aiming to have them removed as rivals for a position on the Slytherin Quidditch team. He tries /hard/ to find friends in Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw for his older brothers, all in an attempt to clench victory for many Slytherin House Cups.

He sees people in the School, and he knows who's pieces they are and how to move them. But some of his plans are failing... someone else is moving the pieces and he's not sure who.

** I am trying to write a story that tells how the four Founders all met and came together and got the idea to use Hogwarts for the school, and it is sort of turning out like X-Men First Class movie! :) But it is very hard to do because I cannot write castles and knights era and I do not know what to make most of their backstories like.

** I'm an aspiring screenwriter, so for practice I wrote a post-battle "pilot" which covered the first day after the battle, but with the series premise that Kingsley does not disband the order and asks Harry to lead them in the hunt for the remaining death eaters. The theme of the pilot was about Harry being lost with what to do now that he's accomplished his life's goal. He spends considerable time in the pilot wandering around the school, trying to figure out his place.

But the general idea of trying to rebuild and reform everything is immensely interesting because it involves changing a world that allowed Voldemort's ideals to take thrive. We know it happened since all was well, but how did it come about? I mean, many of the issues that still plague America regarding race relations are born from our failed Reconstruction efforts after the Civil War, not the war itself.

I have no intentions of writing the series beyond the pilot, and the pilot itself does cover your typical "day after" stuff most readers are familiar with (I did throw in some original stuff like Harry and Ginny's reunion kiss taking place in the roof where all the coffins are kept, and the survivors of the battle converging around a bonfire made up of Death Eater bodies with Voldemort's on the very bottom), but if I had the time or motivation, I'd be interested to see how I'd imagine Reconstruction working.

** Okay, so if you can take a horcrux and (somehow) turn it into a real boy, a la the diary, then you should be able to do that with other horcruxes, like the diadem and the locket, right?

What if Voldemort did that? To all of his horcruxes?

Seven voldemorts, all six revenants (somehow) under the control of Voldemort prime? I'm imagining (for ease of writing) that the voldemorts will be different deadly sins.

Fate (or similar) pulls four Harrys (Gryffindor, ravenclaw, Slytherin and Hufflepuff) and a Hermione, Ron, and either Neville or Draco, and sets them against the Voldemort posse.

Doesn't that sound awesome and terrible?

Never going to write that one, but it's up for adoption if anyone is tickled.

Harry Potter, age five, is not a well treated little boy. But that all changes when, on his first day of school, he meets two new friends, Nick and Perry.

Spoilers, it's the Flamels, who have deaged themselves using the elixir of life, to look after Harry (because Dumbledore didn't seem to be doing a very good job).

That seems like a fair premise, right? We could weave in France, obscene wealth, learning alchemy. . .

** This is more one I'm wanting to do but wanting to do right so I'm anxiously putting it off. I want to write a fic about one of the main characters losing their mom post war, when they're just becoming adults and learning about who they are. I just lost my mom a month and a half ago and so I would like to explore that in writing without it having to be about me specifically. I'm anxious to start writing it though as I want to do it justice. I would want to write a fic that isn't melodrama but help the reader feel the overwhelming loss and pain one gets when they lose a parent or close parent figure.

I'm also not sure what character I would want to write about, I was thinking maybe an AU fic where Fred lives (so Ron or whoever I wrote of the family would not have experienced a loss of a close family member yet) but soon after the war ends Molly ends up dying? I'm simply uneasy about writing such a large family. I would also most likely want to write Ron as the main character as I would like to explore the friendship angle but I've never felt that Ron was that close to his mom. He would go through a very different grieving process then I have and I'm not sure if I'm interested in writing a fic in that vein right now.

I would most easily be able to write Hermione I think but you don't get to know her parents so it would be hard to get the character development of the mom there. Perhaps Neville losing his grandmother would be the best, it's not conflicting with epilogue canon and he would be losing the only mother he ever had just like I did.

The other Harry is influenced by the horcrux in Harry, So he's more ruthless and ambitious, but also more confident and charming, all things Tom was known for. The alternate self helps Harry become a great wizard and take down Voldemort, while also developing from a bizarro-Harry into his own person with agency and a developing personality as well.

** I want to write a story set in the time when pirates roamed free and the British fought with the Spanish and pirates alike. My fic that I outlined in several failed word documents on my desktop would be hugely AU.

In my world magic is much more common but only the highest classes can afford basic necessities such as wands. Going to Hogwarts means that you have a great future in the military such as one Neville Longbottom, future admiral?

Harry would learn magic on a ship while also learning the ropes and being a ship boy. He is being taught by the ships mage and also by Fred and George who are duo watchleaders ( every ship has different watches with watchleaders and so on).

Magic can not traverse far over the open sea. Wands are supreme, staffs are unheard of, magical foci are shared on the ships unless we are talking about the huge war ships with proper mages. No apparating or portkeys across the ocean. Wizards on ships mainly used for defense / offense and helping out with propellation - wind

The story would go as follows: Harry ending up on a ship, learning the ropes, encountering enemies, losing his wizardry mentor - time jump - Harry on a different ship, on his way to the Caribbean, encounter either with voodoo magic or the search for the fountain of youth, Harry on his way back to England, we see how Harry has grown up in his hometown, Harry either being forced or willingly joining the British navy, coming across Longbottom

** A multi-genre crossover epic starring a Master of Death Harry who is doomed to be reincarnated after death as random people from different universes, male and female. He retains his memories as well as the Hallows which he can summon at will.

I imagine after aeons of this cursed existence he is either completely insane, which would make a for a potentially hilarious crackfic or he goes through phases to try and stave of boredom. One lifetime he wants to be the hero again and save the world, one life he wants to just have a normal life and have a family, if you want to be edgy he can have an evil phase and try to conquer the world/universe though that would be absolute anathema to canon Harry.

To only issue is preventing Harry turning into Gary/Mary Su, after countless lifetimes he's bound to pick up thousands of magical or mundane techniques and skills, or you can come up with a creative limiter or weakness.

There have been some stories that have similar premises, but most of them are abandoned or suffer terrible writing and cliches.

** I want to write about a couple of original characters that live in modern Wizarding America. Said characters don't have names yet, but their personalities, gender, and patches of their backstory have been forming in my head since before we found out about Fantastic Beasts being set in New York.

One of them I've been kind of afraid to write about. His race is American Indian, and sense I don't know much about the different tribes that live (or used to live) in the area where these characters reside, I'm afraid of getting something offensively wrong out of ignorance that turns any readers that I would get away. In my mind, he went to Ilvermorny with the other character, but he was also taught his tribes traditional brand of magic by his grandmother. Because of that he is very good at wandless magic, and/or using another traditional magic focusing tool that is TBD.

His style of magic is informed by my idea that wandless magic isn't as hard as the cannon characters think it is. It just has to be practiced at, much like what the cannon characters are doing at Hogwarts. With the same amount of practice time, a wandless wizard would be able to do the same things that a wizard with a wand can.

The other character is the daughter of a Texas jackalope rancher. I've been playing with the idea of making her a Raccoon animagus, and already have a scene written where she transforms into it. I'm also trying to figure out what about her would make her animagus form a raccoon.

The catalyst of the story is TBD, but I keep flopping between a straight murder mystery, Neo Death Eaters (ala American Neo Nazis), or World Quadpot Championships (ala Baseball World Series).

** A Harry Potter/Final Fantasy fusion fic for sure:

After centuries of peace and prosperity, a series of calamities befalls the Kingdom of Pearlclyfe.

The Queen has given birth to a daughter - the Crown Princess, Daphne - invoking a long-dormant blood Curse on the royal line. Children of the nobility disappear one by one: most notably, the infant son of Sir James, commander of the King's special forces. Perhaps worst of all, Sir James and his battalion - Godric's Grenadiers - are slaughtered in a single conflict, losing possession of the land's prized power in a single jewel: the Fire Crystal.

The culprit leaves only a name, written in green among the stars: Voldemort.

Sixteen summers later, the Kingdom is in ruin. The King is dead, leaving his advisors, the Order of Slytherin, to plunder the treasury while forcing the elven and goblin races into servitude. The Princess has been hidden from public view; rumours circulate that she is possessed by eldritch forces. Dementors, phantoms of fear said to be descended from the Four Fiends themselves, suddenly emerge from the shadows, wilting crops and stealing souls.

More vulnerable than ever, the royal castle town of Hogwarts is pillaged without warning. A swarm of black mages led by Voldemort storm the streets, laying waste to its towers with fell magic and bloodthirsty beasts. Amidst the chaos - and the absence of Slytherin's Order - the Princess goes missing in her sleep.

She awakes at sea, under the weary gaze of a green-eyed stranger.

So in a nutshell, HP characters and some creatures mingled with generic Final Fantasy lore. Crystals, classes, colour-coded magic schools and summons and all that good stuff. Bard!Ron and Dragoon!Dean just because.

And because I'll probably die before finishing Untitled Tome, I went ahead and gave its sequels similarly uninspired names ahead of time:

- Harry Potter and the Wildsman's Keep (years 3-4)
- Harry Potter and the Rings of Solomon (years 5-6)
- Harry Potter and the Children of Noah (Long AF)

** I have this plot all sketched out, but I can hardly find the time to actually flesh it out, and whatever I do write, I find it not meeting my expectations.

Harry is ignored but not abused by the Dursleys. He's not shy and easily intimidated. He's got a plan to become independent and not rely on Dursleys as soon as he can make a living for himself.

My characters are not characters reduced to caricatures or cartoons found in children's books. E.g. Dursleys do not love Harry, but they are not foolish and obscenely cruel to him. Dumbledore has means to check on Harry and does not ignore his charge as he does in Cannon. Snape is not unreasonably idiotic when it comes male Potters. He doesn't like Harry, but he doesn't go out of his way to bully him. He acts as a two-faced smart spy is ought to. Draco is not an idiot, he's still a blood purist but a smart one who is trained well. Ron is not a Chess prodigy and idiot at the same time. He's smart but lazy. Hermione is not overly smart, as in smarter than her teachers. But of course smarter and more well read than her peers.

Lastly, Voldemort is smarter and he does not lash out irrationally at his own people.

I have always felt that most fanfics and even canon does not portray these characters to be real people with common sense. Most of them act irrationally because of plot requirements. I want to read and write a story with characters who are smart, on both sides. Not unbelievably smart like Methods of Rationality. But normal smart like the people you encounter in real life. I want to witness the conflict between those characters in the HP world.

** I have a couple that I will never write (and mostly would rather read).

1. I'd like to write a story where Ron has to go back in time to stop a dark future from happening. Its Ron because Hermione dies accidently when the time travel spell gets out of control. Ron was never supposed to be the one to go back. He was just the only one left. And he's not hardened apocalyptic Ron, or super powered Ron, etc., he's just regular old canon Ron who has to try his best.

2. An adventure story starring Luna Lovegood post-Hogwarts where she tries to discover a legendary animal in some super exotic locale like a temple in the Amazon rain forest or a lost island of Atlantis.

3. Ron joins the Chudley Cannons post-Hogwarts in attempt to find his own place in the world. There really is a curse on the team and it can only be defeated with determination, team work, and the power of friendship. A side-plot would be George overcoming his deep despair by helping Ron train. Written in the style of an underdog sports movie.

** A particular Wizzard performs a ritual every so often which involves him possessing a developing baby/fetus (preferably his own) to cheat death and learn as much magic as possible. This wizard attends a different magic school each time and has no memory of any previous lives until he reaches adulthood. Over time, he developed a second personality which followed him into each new body and in later in the fic, they merge into a single personality (for a time) and the wizard learns a bunch o' new tricks, specifically, methods of rendering one's self-immune to spells (including the killing curse and the ability to raise themselves from the dead as much as they want, similar to how Harry came back). The wizard is a descendant of Salazar Slytherin and creates a suit of armour for himself which has a snakehead helmet. The only problem is that I can't think of a goal for the merged wizard to have.

** Two stories:\\
1) Harry in Durmstrang. Non-Karkaroff headmaster (story notes have him sentenced to Azkaban instead of receiving lenience). Harry is left with a previously forgotten cousin of Petunia's, who married a Norwegian wizard. An old-school Norwegian Wizard, who is full Pagan. At Durmstrang, Harry comes into conflict with the ‘new wave', aka Christianity (reflecting the Christian takeover of Norway's religion), and agnosticism. The main perspectives were Harry and Alva, the new female inductee to Durmstrang's Pagan group. Antagonists Kristian and Alija, representing Christianity, and (undecided+undecided) for atheism/agnosticism. Story was supposed to take place in fifth year, with a notably different but still recognizably Harry Harry. Ends at reaching a very tentative peace between the three factions at Durmstrang. Harry and Alva get romantically involved (doesn't start out healthy but gets healthier with each chapter), needed research on Pagan courting. Story focused on reconciliation of the three ideological parties.

2)Harry in Beauxbaons. Harry doesn't go to Petunia in the first place, but to to the Dutch Meesters family, who owe Dumbledore heavily. Set during fourth year, Triwizard Tournament at Beauxbatons. Friendship with Fleur, bonding over getting attention neither wants, but nothing romance planned. Develop friendship with some of the Hogwarts cast (specifically the Twins, others optional). Harry's still a champion, along with Fleur. Maxime is /not/ happy, and there are a lot of ruffled feathers to flatten, to greater and lesser success. Some of the lesser successes try their plots against Harry, to greater and lesser success.

** linkffn(12598504) Is the first part of my major Harry Potter/Danny Phantom Crossover. It is a merger AU, with elements of Danny Phantom adapted into the HP-verse with a liberal dash of original flavor.

For Instance:

*Harry was sent to live with the Fentons.

*Jack Fenton is Lily's cousin, Maddie is James' cousin.

*The Potters are descended from Salazar Slytherin, as the Peverell Brothers are his great-grandchildren.

*The Fentons are distantly related to Paracelsus.

*Salazar loathes the Gaunt Family.

Volume I covers years 1 and 2, while Volume II will cover years 3-7. The for this is because Vol II will be much darker.

*There will be bloody duels that end in people being impaled.

*The secret of Danny's scars.

*Major character deaths.

*Fenrir Greyback

*Loss of limb

*Dark wizards being maimed or otherwise brutalized.

*Our favorite Dark Witch will meet a sticky end because she had flunked a core subject.

*And much, much more.

** I'll be honest, it's a little silly but ive been thinking about if Harry had been put up for adoption and adopted into a large family (all adopted children) with two moms. Its been an ever growing au in my head for far too long, featuring Harry as a shy artistic type who grew up loved and supported instead of belittled and neglected. Featuring: Harry's tomboy older sister, his twin little sisters and his baby brother. His mothers are very involved and refuse to allow harry to be manipulated or mistreated, one of them is a lawyer and the other has a good office job but usually works from home in order to spend more time with her family. Also they have a golden retriever. I'm very interested in what kind of dynamics would occur in a world with such a well-supported boy-who-lived. i'd be interested in this story if i were to read it but i just dont have the means to pull off a story that would probably be focused on a more slice-of-life style

** A couple of them have rattled around in my brain

Harry Potter X Marvel Could be Avengers movies plus extra stuff if the author isn't comfortable with wider Marvel Harry is about 24/25 and is returning to the UK after about 4 months abroad working with the ICW's forces in taking down Dark Lords around the world. Harry's position in the Auror department is actually very involved and in the 7 years since the final battle Harry has be come the most dangerous and most skilled member of the unit, highly decorated and trained Harry is a major player to become head of the department in another 10 years. But that is until Kingsley personally selects Harry for a role in a joint operation between the Ministry of Magic and the Muggle Government. You see quietly for the last 7 years since Voldemorts death, Dark Creatures like Vampires, Werewolves (with many pointing out that Remus was seemingly a outlier and not the norm), Trolls, Giant Monsters (from the Marvel Universe), and other violent and dangerous creatures have been far more active and bold with a a common thread, every group has been lead by a Vampire. Asked to join as the first and lead Field Operator of the new project. Harry is given a Medallion of Pendragon which basically turns him into a Magical Super Soilder (very similar to Captain America). Harry's task is to defeat these threats to the realm and eventually to kill the source of all these Vampires, Dracula which means teaming up with Lilith Drake aka Dracula's Daughter.

Why write this? Everyone forgets that Marvel is bigger than the movies and I am truly tired of movie rehashes. Plus this would expand the world to the magical realm and the number of Villains out side of Loki.

Harry Potter X Highschool DxD Harry leaves England after his 5th year when Voldemort tries possessing Harry it backfires killing him and all his Horcruxes, when Harry's remorse is confused with his own which triggers a failure cascade and the amount of them, the backlash just kills Riddle. Going east as a way of evading his own story as his face and name is being plastered all over the western magical news, Harry ends up going to Kuoh Academy. He becomes a New Born Devil under Risa or Sons or maybe Seekvaira.

Just tired of Harry being someone's illegitimate son, usually someone who is "Misunderstood" see Serial killing rapist rather than that monster James Potter, how dare he die for his family and bully a racist, end up getting a Evil Piece set and then the story immediately ending due to not having a plot line to follow.

Harry Potter x Bleach Fullbringer!Harry The Dementors are in actuality a Dark Wizards attempt at harnessing the powers and abilities of Hollows (all Wizards are Spiritual Aware, Ghost are Wizards who attached there Soul Chains to places rather than getting Mondo's). Thus anyone exposed to Them are basically being attacked by a Hollow. Unknown to many people, James and Lily during the first 5 months of her pregnancy had been on the battlefield fighting and had seen and battled Dementias and had been nearly kissed a few times, this leaves a mark on Harry and his Reiryoku. Harry's Fullbringing is in actuality the thing that kills Voldemort, his Spiritual energy connecting to the Death Stick. Deciding to learn more about this stuff Harry leaves England to train in understanding it, he ends up in Japan months before Ichigo meets Rukia and becomes a Shinigami for the first time. Harry spends him time experimenting with his powers while fighting the many Hollows that appear in Karakura. That is until the Hollow Kill off by Uryuu and Ichigo.

** Well, any of the ones I have in my head at the moment or in my notes. I'm currently writing two with a lot of notes and ideas for a third. I switch between the two I'm writing depending on my muse and how viscously the plot bunny attacks me.

I have a Slytherin!Harry who had a couple of slight changes to his upbringing which made him go with Slytherin. It is an AU world as I wish to change several cultural aspects and go off on a tangent on what Magic actually is.

My other main one starts in fourth year and Harry isn't handling the rejection well and makes a whole lot of things worse. Main characters are Harry Potter, Bill Weasley, Horace Slughorn, Weasley twins, Hermione Granger and Daphne Greengrass. My main focus on this one is to try and create a world with less dependence on luck for Harry to win and realistic characters.

My third main fic is a Harry raised by Narcissa and Andromeda fic due to him being the Black heir. It is AU and Sirius will be featured but will be more beholden to his cousins rather than Dumbledore. I can see so many possibilities with this that it just sounds fun to me.

I won't start posting my fics until I have a full fic to post so it could take a while.

** A Harry Potter/Danmachi crossover(basic idea is that Harry becomes a Danmachi God and then makes a Familia in the Harry Potter world)

Harry Potter threw powerful accidentle Magic transports him self to the Danmachi. To transport himself he used so much magic that he acceded to the level of Danmachi Godhood. During the journey he channeled so much magic he killed himself only for the horcrux to take his place in death.

Harry then crashes on the outskirts of the city Orario with the first God on the scene stabliising Harry Godhood. Because a new born God might help with his boredom.

When Harry wakes up it is discovered that he has amnesia so the gods hold a meeting to work out what to do with him.

After the meeting Harry is made the ward of the moderately powerful and neutral Godess Hepheastus. With him staying her ward for his first 85 years in the Danmachi world.

After 85 years Harry takes a 100 year trip around the Danmachi world before returning to Orario to start his own Familia with some core members that he recruited during his travels.

For the next 100 years thing are peaceful until the fall of the [[/spoiler][Zeus and Hera familias. During the Evilus incident Harrys Familia is wiped out completely along with and but one of member of the Astraea Familia.]]

[[/spoiler][Harry join Ryuu lion on her ramage against Evilus with him Even using his Arcanum to kill the Gods that were part of Evilus to send them back to The Upper world the hard way.]]

[[/spoiler][After Evilus is wiped out Harry is put on trial before the other gods for useing his Arcanum in the lower world with his punishment being banished back to the upper world.]]

When the Gods do the spell to banish harry it sends him back to the Harry Potter world instead of the upper world because what the spell really dose is send gods back to the last world that were in which for most gods is the Upper world.

Thanks to destiny trying to keep the prophecy of trackHarry reappears in his cupboard minutes after he left and gets his old memories back. His power and memory's from the Danmachi world are then mostly suppressed leavening Harry with only his aura of divinity and the ability that Allows all gods of the Danmachi world to know when they are being lied to.

Harry then goes on to live out the rest of his live at the dursleys as per canon.

During his first year at hogwarts he taps into his magic ability that he learn during his time in the Danmachi world with them fully awakening at the end of the year when he uses the magic spell the destroyers a magic item to learn how to make it to destroy the Stone to stop Voldemort from getting it.

At the end of second year he regaining his godly body and development abilitys after being poisoned by the basilisk.

Over third year the dementor are interested in Harry because they can sense the memories from his time in the Danmachi world. The suppression of his memory's is overpowered at the end of the year when they are attack by the dementors on the way back up to the castle. After regaining his memory's Harry taps into his Arcanum to power a Patronus that not only drives dementors away but destroys them. Harry memory's then slip away and slowly return over the next three years.

Because the dementors were destroyed Sirus was questioned useing veritaserm to find out how he did it only for his innocence to come out.

Over fourth year Harry slowlyly regains the memory's of his time as Hepheastus ward and the first 15 years of his travels.

Over fifth year he regains the memory's of the rest of his time traveling and his first 15 years in Orario with his familia. During the D.A. Meeting Harry gives each member a falna Turing them into a Familia.

Over sixth year he gets the memory's of his time in Orario and the memory's of the death of his first familia.

That is the basic plan there would be changes changes threw out the story from Harry not being a Horcrux(he would still be able to talk to snakes thoug) and other things but they would build up over time.

** I write a long-fic where letter-writing is very central to the wizarding world as a form of connectivity and relationship-building, and I have the occasional letter within the text or I'll reference a lot of letters, but /God/, I'd really love to do a companion piece that's just banks of letters.

Like, epistolary-style alongside of the regular narrative that could be read either alongside, after or before the full story, but I just know that it'd be so difficult to compile letters in that way, writing them in the individual characters' voices and then presenting them in a way that's very easy to follow.

The books cover the defeat of Voldemort during Harry's school years, and after that continuity is finished I plan to write Harry becoming a kind of investigative journalist and writing about his adventures/investigations - kind of like Lockhart's books - and I'd love to write those stories in the first person in the way that they would be published, too, but ah!

I know that would be so hard to write in a way that's genuinely very engaging, and that many people embark on biography or textbook style works and end up abandoning them.

- A story where Vernon snaps when Hagrid picks up Harry from the lighthouse. Hagrid doesn't escort Harry all the way home from Diagon, so Vernon picks him up at the train station, drives him straight to a heavily wooded national park, ties him to a tree, beats him severely enough to break all his limbs, burns hedwig and all his hogwarts supplies, and leaves him to die.

** I have a few plot ideas, one that sticks is a Tomione/Vomione (yeah, sorry) story. You need a strong thing to get them together obviously, and I was always very interested in occlumency/legilimency, so a story where Hermione helps Harry with occlumency in 5th year, practices it a lot and becomes very good at it, so she starts on legilimency too. Naturally, or through an accident, she discovers she can't quite "turn off" the legilimency and randomly hears thoughts of other people. She, in some way, be in presence of Voldemort and would hear his thoughts, react without thinking and he'd be interested/mad, he'd imprison her, realize her possible usefulness, and then stuff would happen haha. I usually hate the stories about soul bonds, soulmates tattoos and stuff like that, but with the right concept and writing it'd be something I'd love to read. Full of angst, hurt, comfort, and a very badass Hermione who won't let Voldemort get away with everything. I guess I think I have relatively decent writing skills, but the time is lacking.

But the basics would be that the I/we/whatever gets reborn in a Pureblood family, one that has ties with both the Sayres and the Gaunts, effectively making them an Heir. Cliche, I know. But I love sneks.

Another twist is, I/we/she become indoctrinated in the ways of Pureblood supremacy. Not something you see every day.

** After his first year Harry realises that he needs to prepare for Voldemort's return. Having been taught to swim by Vernon trying to drown him while shouting 'Sink or Swim' Harry decides that if he can get multiple older years to fling stinging hexes and other painful curses at him every few days he will either be in a lot of pain or become able to defend himself.

This sends Harry to Oliver Wood who won't do it out of principle but an upper year Slytherin overhears and offers to do this if Harry pays and ropes in some friends. The Slytherins believe that they can't get away with killing Harry like their families may want but they aren't tutoring him in dueling just torturing him and making him pay them so they won't get in trouble.

Eventually Harry becomes competent at fighting large groups simultaneously and the Slytherins, having seen him never give up despite all their hexes, either respect him or become fond of him. They then shut Malfoy up (as he's annoying).

4th year comes around, after the lake task being unwatchable magical screens are set up the are linked to invisible floating mirrors or something attracted to Dramatics (why not?). Harry and Cedric portkey, make it to graveyard, Harry saves Cedric, puts up a better fight with V, no priori, goes back and everyone saw. No Umbridge. See where it goes from there.
