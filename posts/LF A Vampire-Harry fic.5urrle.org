I'm looking for a vampire fic (NOT TWILIGHT VAMPIRES) where Harry gets infected, and is overwhelmed with the instinct to grow his own coven. Over time he infects more and more people into his coven, growing more and more powerful as he gains power boosts from having Lesser Vampires (since he is the one who infects the others, he'd be a Greater Vampire, or a Vampire Lord). Maybe he even gains an alternate form similar to the Vampire Lord from Elder Scrolls V: Dawnguard?

If nothing like this exists, maybe I'll write it, but if there is a fic like this, send me a link.


** I don't know any fics like that but I'll love you to write it :3

** I think there was one that involved Harry as the PC from Vampire the Masquerade:Bloodlines.
