A bizarre idea crossed my head after I made a typo yesterday and I haven't been able to get it out.

After meeting Bill Weasley and learning about his job, Harry decides that being a curse breaker sounds like the most incredible job in the world, and dedicates himself to becoming one. After Voldemort's defeat, he succeeds in becoming a globe-trotting curse breaker known for his leather jacket and fedora. While he regularly brings back so many artifacts for Gringotts that his superiors don't want to fire him, they also refuse to give him tenure because of his total disregard for accepted methodology and ethics, lack of any published articles about his findings, hiring of underage children as assistants while working in third world countries, unaccountable dalliances with witches linked to Dark Lords, and that time he attempted to burn down the Gringotts herpetology department.


** "What are you going to do with the Elder Wand, Harry?" Hermione asked, her gaze fixed on the wand in Harry's hand.

"He's going to keep it, of course," laughed Ron. "It's the most powerful wand in the world. He'd have to be barmy to give it up."

Harry stared at the wand for a long moment, then held it up before him. "The first brother wanted this wand to prove he'd beaten Death. Voldemort wanted it... because he coveted the power. Dumbledore wanted to save others from it. But really..."

He conjured a case out of thin air, before reverently placing the wand inside. "...It belongs in a museum."

** Well, I've written a series where Harry, influenced by Bill, does become a Curse-Breaker and travels the world with Ron and Hermione. And is banned from several magical countries, wanted for stealing artefacts from private collections, and other questionable actions. The first story is mostly focused on Petunia, but also features some of the trio's adventures at Hogwarts and in Egypt, the second shows their search for Atlantis.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".

** "Harry! For the last time, you are NOT allowed to steal from the ruins of the original Mecha!" Riptooth said, his voice gravelly and tired

Harry replied "But-"

"No buts, I'm going to have to put you on cursebreaker duty around here"

"Oh come on!" Harry cried, why couldn't Riptooth understand that it was just too shiny to leave!
