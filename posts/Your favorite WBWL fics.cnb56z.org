  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

I'm going to make you listen, because I want you to understand how you made me a monster. I'll call this story antithesis, and you're going to learn every single moment where things went wrong. I want you to cry, and beg for me to kill you, and when I'm done with this, you're going to want to do that to yourself. You're going to listen, because in the end, you owe me that much. You owe me so much more, but here we are, and this is how it's going to end. Who knows, maybe this useless battle between you and me and this bloody world, well, maybe we always were fated to kill each other. Do you know what it is like to be unmade?

  Ever wonder what would happen if the sorting hat hadn't given Harry a choice, or if Harry was more focused on his life and where he wanted to take it rather than stupid rumors? This is that story, but there may be some scenes that don't include Harry. For instance, a scene where Draco confides in his father or a scene where Hermione apologizes for stealing from Snape.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

  Harry's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is already looking to be more complicated than the first. He has a place in Slytherin House, but it's by no means secure; he's still feuding with his father and his twin brother; he still has a problem with trusting authority. On top of that, there are whispers of dark things coming to Hogwarts, and as much as Harry might like to stay out of it, he probably won't be able to. Especially since he's the Slytherin Potter.

  It's Harry's third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and just like the last two, it promises to be anything but restful. House tensions are high, Harry's twin Jules, the darling of Gryffindor, doesn't like Harry any better than before, and on top of all that there's an escaped murderer on the loose who's apparently hell-bent on taking his revenge on both Potter twins.

  It is Harry Potter's fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. With international politics, someone out to kill Jules Potter, the Boy Who Lived, and Slytherin House's internal drama, this year seems pretty standard. Admittedly, the last time there was a dragon anywhere near Hogwarts, it fit in Hagrid's hut and didn't pose much of a danger to anyone. Who thought the Triwizard Tournament was appropriate for teenagers?

  Harry Potter returns for his fifth year at Hogwarts amidst an increasingly unstable political situation. And this year, for the first time, Hogwarts is no longer firmly under Albus Dumbledore's control. Threats inside and outside the school put pressure on some of Harry's closest friendships, and power struggles lie beneath the surface of every faction in the brewing conflict. At its center is the Potter family, and Harry's position is more critical, and more precarious, than ever.

** Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived is hands down my favorite. It has such well written characters that I actually love even the most hateful characters. It feels realistic in an odd way. It's hard to explain the plot without spoilers, but I recommend it. It's very close to the mystery-canon style which makes it feel very authentic.
