** Depends on whether you consider LdS Harry/Emily. There's certainly an intimate relationship between them, but it's not explicitly romantic. At least, for the moment. There are multiple dynamics that are unsettling and it's great.

***** Wait, what am I wrong about? Have I forgotten something that establishes a romantic relationship for Harry?

****** You said that

#+begin_quote
  There's certainly an intimate relationship between them
#+end_quote

Which is clearly true, so [[/u/TE7]] can't be referring to that

#+begin_quote
  but it's not explicitly romantic.
#+end_quote

Also true

#+begin_quote
  At least, for the moment.
#+end_quote

So maybe it's neither H/E or H/H, if that's what [[/u/TE7][u/TE7]] means by us both being wrong?

ninja edit: Maybe I've just got my HP/HG shipper goggles on: It's possible that the end of ch25 isn't shipping and is just hurt/comfort sort of thing

EditÂ²: I've reread some bits, H/E look to have /something/ going on in ch14, so it's looking more like H/E.

******* u/DaniScribe:
#+begin_quote
  neither
#+end_quote

Well, that's what I meant by spoiler if his post confirms that it isn't going to be either relationship. The eventual end doesn't matter so much to me because as long as a relationship makes sense (it doesn't even have to be healthy), I ship it.

Regarding what's going on currently, I think neither Harry nor Hermione are exactly sure what they're doing other than being teenagers and Hermione may be reacting to Emily's influence on Harry. Viewing end of 25 through that lens is interesting, though I'm not sure if that's what TE7 intends.

As far as I'm concerned the story is engaging enough that I'm even considering complex relationship dynamics (romantic or otherwise) and that's awesome regardless of future events. I recommend the story in every relevant thread because it's a refreshing diversion from every character being a caricature of themselves.

********** Harry's been lusting after Emily for a long time - and there are plenty of little lines in the story to illustrate that. His relationship with Hermione has always been more about the teasing than anything else.

He's also her best friend. He sees her as his friend who was just sexually assaulted by two thugs. He'll still flirt and tease because he understands she wants things to go back to normal, and teasing is part of that. Yes it could change in time, but it's not happening any time soon.

***** I'm pretty sure this will turn out a gen fic. Harry's nowhere near suited for Emily in a romantic pairing. If anything, she's an older sib or parental figure, a mentor and confidant, not a lover. The last chapters have shown that she's worlds apart in life experience. That's not the stuff of a relationship.

And Harry's largely outgrown Hermione at this point, so that ship won't sail.

**** That's one of the things that I find interesting about the story.

[[/s][spoiler]]

Not to mention I found the last part of chapter 25 to be a bit unexpected. I'm not entirely convinced of motive. I'll have to go back and read Hermione's dialogues again, it's been a while for some chapters.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.
