So, I remember this from quite a while ago but don't remember the name or enough of it to find the exact story. But, I do know there was one character in the story who was a woman from Asia, I believed she used a sword, and he was a part of some sort of guild. She took a contract to do something and it led to an interaction with HP near hogwarts, I believe. I also remember she was tricked into believing she had signed a magical contract forcing her to complete the job and HP basically said that was super stupid because in the past people from a guild all had to sign a similar contact and destroy some sort of beast and so if they faced the beast they died and if they didn't they died. I remember, I think the woman pledged fealty to harry at some point? I am sorry but if anyone knows what i am talking about.... help?
