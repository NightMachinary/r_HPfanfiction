(I'm thinking this one'd probably be a shorter fic, like Stanrick's collection).

It's been a century since the Second Great Blood War, and the fight has been forgotten. Things have relaxed into regularity and stagnated into the steady same-old-same-old once again. Neville is still teaching at Hogwarts, a century-long career trying to get children interested in the delightful dirtiness of Herbology.

One day, a mediwitch strides into the great hall and informs the headteacher that the DADA teacher will be off for the next week with (insert Wizarding disease here). Neville chuckles, remembering old times, then offers to take the classes. He has the time. The students are... sceptical. The nice, kindly, sweet little old man that is Professor Longbottom is not the sort of person they think has ever even seen a Dark Art, never mind defended against them. The man literally constructed an intricate catch-release trap to avoid killing a fly in his greenhouse last month.

But he's given the classes, and come Monday, the students are filing in to the DADA room, no idea what to expect. Hoping, at least, this lesson won't be another History of Magic. He couldn't be as bad as Binns, right?

Thus begins the greatest week of DADA lessons Hogwarts has ever seen...

(Your choice what that means. :D)


** The class filed into the DADA room, scrunching their noses at the overpowering stench of garlic. "CONSTANT VIGILANCE!" Longbottom roared, as he Imperiused a first year.

"Your favorite color is green and you want a red and white tentaculus for your birthday," the child droned in monotone.

The rest of the first years were tripping over themselves and cowering in fear of a boggart that was chasing them around, changing swiftly from serial murderer to dragon eventually taking the form of Professor Longbottom for one student.

"WRITE AN ESSAY ON WEREWOLVES... USING A BLOOD QUILL!" Neville bellowed, his eyes crazy as he trained his wand on the traumatized children.

Then he banished the boggart and started putting order to his classroom. "And that was just the first five years. You don't want to know how my seventh was."
