OT3: One true threesome. like otp, but with three characters/people rather than two.


** I wouldn't call it my favorite, but I'm a bit shocked at the lack of good Harry/Ron/Hermione threesomes I've come across. When I do find it most of it is bad.

  Now, twenty years old and done with boys and looking forward very much to putting her hand down some lucky girl's shirt later this evening, Ginny looks at Dean Thomas's gold-painted fingernails and feels heat pool between her legs.

  Fuck, she thinks, and flushes, annoyed, ashamed, and then Seamus Finnegan comes up behind Dean and kisses him deep on the mouth, and Ginny's heart starts to pound.

** Harry/Hermione/Luna, both as a romantic threesome and as a platonic replacement for the golden trio. Literally superior in every way. Luna is a much better foil for Hermione and brings some much needed calm instead of constant agitation to Harry's life.

My favourite one of these? I recced this yesterday and I find it fitting again.

linkffn(6858689) H/Hr/Ron, goes to some rather dark places but the plot is rather solid. Harry's recovery from Malfoy Manor is far from easy, causing the trio to grow closer than ever.

*** It's a good fic, but I wouldn't rec it without mentioning the *extensive* torture and angst. It's probably /the/ most angsty fic I've ever read, not to mention all the depression and attempted suicide and shit. It's only good if you're happy to read something really depressing, dour and morose.

Also the ending is a major cop-out and a disgrace.

  On the hunt for the Horcruxes, the trio are captured and subjected to horrors at the hands of the Death Eaters. This is more than just a torture fic, it chronicles their lives, their struggles, and their relationships in the aftermath. Warning: This fic depicts violence, rape, torture, suicide,etc. Both HET & SLASH. It is intended for a mature audience.

** Snape/Hermione/Lucius. The order here is very important. I prefer to have limited romantic/sexual interaction between the fellas, but rather their devotion be directed at Hermione, while their closeness as friends leads them to be happy sharing her.

**** I am totally here for this! Happy with Hermione + any combination of Snape/Lucius/Draco. I definitely ship Hermione with older guys and I just find these characters more interesting than Harry, Ron, Viktor, etc. It's also open to interesting redemption arcs. Though I'll happily admit that there are plenty of fics with these kinds of pairing which just gloss over all the morally gray and downright terrible stuff they've done in the past and pretend that they're really super nice people - but where's the fun in that?!? The fact that Lucius and Snape lend themselves very nicely to BDSM stories is an added bonus :)

I've read quite a few other HG/Slytherin pairings too (Blaise, Theo, Marcus Flint, Adrian Pucey) but don't find these as interesting because they haven't got an established backstory so, imo, they tend to be a bit more bland and self-inserty.

Is there anything in particular that bothers you about these pairings or is it more just that you don't care either way?

**** I'm a wild animal, that's why! Jokes........ mostly... I think it's probably more from the movie characters than the books, if you know what I mean? Especially Lucius and Hermione because Jason Isaacs and Emma Watson are üî• but anyway! I write and read them mostly in a BDSM setting with the blokes as Doms and Hermione as a sub (shared sub in my own writings). I see them as powerful, but fallible and everyone (except Umbridge) is redeemable to a degree. I'm not saying either of them would ever be saints, but I like to investigate and create underlying reasons for their behaviour - such as Abraxas having a heavy influence on Lucius' behaviour and beliefs. I'm rambling. They're hot as Doms. That's basically it. I like guys with long hair and I don't really know otherwise. I'll shut up now.

Edit: Alan Rickman was pretty üî• back in the day too.

****** Most of the stories are SS/HG where Lucius joins them occasionally or HG/LM where Severus joins them occasionally. It's not always in a BDSM setting, but I think, due to the nature of the characters, that is the kind of story the pairing is best suited to. Feel free to find me on Wattpad or AO3 and read my main work, Bound, if you're looking to read something with that triad because it might help you understand why. I dunno. It's like, moderately good writing with an editor who is amaze balls and yeah, [insert convincing argument here]. So I can't remember my reddit username, but my writing username is SilverAconite.
