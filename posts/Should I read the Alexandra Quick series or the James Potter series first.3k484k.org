** I'd read Alexandra Quick series, then I'd read the Albus Potter series. I'm on the first book of the James Potter series right now, and I'm not sure I'll read the second one. It falls flat for me.

** James Potter is very Americanised which works in AQ cause it's set in America but not set in Britian.

I'd go for one of the Albus Potter series' if you want a next gen fic.

** Alexandra Quick. It's probably the best-written fanfiction series I've ever read.

By the way, you should come over to [[/r/AlexandraQuick]] for some discussion on it!!

** Well, AQ isn't finished yet. What's up is good, but I find it really frustrating that it's been years since the last update.

Seconding the Albus Potter series. It's semi-recently been completed too! (author page [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1619871/Vekin87][here]]).
