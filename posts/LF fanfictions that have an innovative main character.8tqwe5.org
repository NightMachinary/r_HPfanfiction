Preferably Snape or Hermione but anyone is OK really


** linkffn(Echoes of Power I: Anger): Harry is relatively talented, but never uses advanced spells or the like. For example, to get past the stair trap in Gryffindor tower, he uses a levitation charm on himself then summons part of the wall to pull himself upwards. He defeats Ginny three times with a cushioning charm (its actually a good scene).

linkffn(Realignment): Harry at one point escapes Grindelwald with the wand-lighting charm.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Unlocked Power): Harry modifies a few spells (ex. the stunning curse) and uses tricks like hardening someones clothes or conjuring water that he then freezes to trip his opponent.

linkffn(Ectomancer): Harry has a limited arsenal, but he uses it to the best of his abilities. He defeats a troll with nothing but nails and the banishing and summoning charms.

linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School): Harry is a master of creative thinking here. Whats cool is that he evolves into that as the story goes on, instead of at the beginning where he powers through his enemies.

  Harry mysteriously disappeared at age 6, and then benefited from years of tutoring from an old family friend. With the return of Voldemort, it's finally time for 15 year old, trained, somewhat cynical and sarcastic Harry to return. Full summary inside

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

** Linkffn(The Arithmancer) and Linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) are both good options. Arithmancer is a Hermione who's a maths prodigy and uses Arithmancy to create a ton of new spells. PP is a fem!Harry who's a potion's prodigy, but also just a magical prodigy in general. She creates multiple potions I believe, as well as inventing a new use for mind magic, etc

**** It's difficult to say. The first potion is a Polyjuice variant that is only really useful for Harriet/her cousin's unique situation, but it does stretch the bounds of belief that no one's invented it before (though it's never addressed whether someone else had and Harriet just couldn't find record of it).

The mind magic isn't overpowered: it's mainly to resolve the conflict of 1st year, and while it's an unusual power that puts her on the radar for some powerful people, it leaves her body vulnerable in a way that makes it unsuited for combat, spying, etc.
