*** I don't necessarily mean slave love, I meant the idea that Harry could get Ginny or Hermione to become slaves through a life debt (usually because of CoS and troll in first year.)

I've read a few that can be good with this idea (slave bonds), but I have no idea where this originally came from. Which is what i wanted to know.

**** Yeah, these are fan theories. When Rowling explained how life debts worked, like during Pettigrew's act of releasing the chokehold on Harry in malfoy mannor during deathly hallows; people just extended that theory, since Harry had a habit of gathering life debts. JK Rowling denied these theories, when questioned,

** I believe that most of the reasoning comes from extrapolation from canon. For instance, Pettigrew's change of heart at Malfoy Manor in /Deathly Hallows/ could be read as attributable to the effects of his life debt to Harry. Dumbledore spoke of life debts as a serious thing in canon so it's not that hard to imagine their manifesting in this way. And if life debts can do that, the fanon reasoning goes, what else can they do in a world where compulsion, possession, rewriting of memories, and the Imperius Curse are known to exist.

Though not a slave debt per se, the hacking of life debts was used by jbern in linkffn(2686464) in 2005. There are earlier instances in fanfiction but most I recall appear along the lines of the compelling feelings of obligation that Pettigrew felt in canon.

The Veela bond may have been first popularized by the "mating" concept in Jeconais's /Hope/. [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/]] It's a bit of fridge horror wrapped in a pretty romance package with a Garry Stu protag. The "mate" idea comes from certain species of birds who mate for life and the realization that Veela have birdlike qualities. Tim wasn't the first to do this (many of his ideas were borrowed from others), but he was the one who put it front and center in a highly regarded story at the time.

House Elf symbiosis was a way of explaining their lots in life in canon. House Elves are largely broken: they are exceptionally powerful chattel tied to houses, yet answerable to wizards to the point of self-mutilation at even the thought of violating their masters' orders. To what benefit to themselves are they doing this if they don't get something in return? The symbiosis explanation provides that. Also, they provide a convenient device in stories that wish to tweak or bash Hermione.

Slavery isn't mutually beneficial. They don't have to do it for any reason but being structurally weak. Dobby throws Malfoy backwards, but doesn't hurt him otherwise. Who is to say that he /could/? And if he could, how does that stack up against wizarding society?

I'm sure a lot of slaves in America were nominally stronger than their oppressors. They did manual labour. But as a minority with no structural power most slave revolts ended quickly to their detriment. You only get successful revolts in places like Haiti, where slavery loses economic feasibility while the slaves far outnumber the slave holders.

**** I quite like the idea as espouced by fanon just to be different from OTL and not have another thing to wherein muggles are utterly better than wizards.

It is furthermore based on, in my opinion, on not everything in teh books which at first glance look like something we've had in our 'muggle' history. At the same time symbiosis is something which happens in nature very readilly, look only at dogs for example. Many an animal rights activist argues that dogs are oppressed or even enslaved by us humans. And they have a point, at the same time us humans are dogs' niche in evolution.

It is therefore not unthinkable, to me at least, that there may be magical creatures whom lack magic of their own and fuction as a kind of leech on humans and their magic. It is somthing similar to how WoW for example pictures elves, but then taken to an extreme: Elves are addicted to magic, and where the High Elves in WoW got their magic from the Sunwell, and where Bloodelves got their magic from daemons, and now from teh repaired Sunwell, and the Nightborne get their magic from the Nightwell. House Elves get their magic from their bond with their (human) families.

If this is based on evolution, enslavement based on their race/bloodlines/magic or even a mix of all of these, is uncertain but it allows the position House Elves take up to not automatically have to be evil slavery like in the American South in history. It allows for it to be nuanced, even more evil than in the case of slavery in the American South (ie. House ELves have been made to be dependent magically on their families and cannot break that) or it is not as evil as it may appear at first instance, ie. these elves have naturally evolved into that position.

** there's a reason these kind of shitty ideas are found in fics that are also badly written.

the ideas themselves are easily extrapolated from canon material which means you don't need a fanfic to come up with them. however good authors recognize a shitty idea and don't write a story around them.

people who write badly are also prone to write with bad ideas.

*** They can only be "easily extrapolated" from canon if you flip canon on its head. There is nothing resembling a "Veela bond" in canon, life debts do not yield anything like slavery and House-elves have the literal opposite of a symbiotic bond.

******* Would he? He never even directly mentions the absurdity of blood purity to the student body at large (the closest is something he said to Lucius when he removed a library book featuring pureblood propaganda; this might have been in supplemental material to the series). And even of he did mention the issue with house elves, it's likely purebloods owning elves wouldn't care because they hold to the supremacy of wizards or would scoff. I mean, Lucius refers to Dobby as his servant, so the others would probably just think he's off his rocker if he called the elves slaves and the parents slavers (even Ron's only defense was "but they like it right?")

And anyway, it doesn't seem to have any clear means to undo besides the clothing, otherwise Hermione probably would have had a better tactic than hiding hats. :)

***** The only thing I would like to point out is that you literally gave him no fanfics that popularized the idea of any of those tropes. Which was the second question he asked, so technically still correct.

Now if you had actually gave him a list or even a general direction in which to start (such as listing Harry Potter communities of fanfiction net that collect fics in a a specific time span) you'd have a point on his reading comprehension. But you don't and you committed the same mistake you just mocked him for.

Or gave him a really long non answer, in which case I don't really see the point of other than to self congradulate yourself on a well done troll job? And to that I'd have to say as much as I would like reddit to actually be a forum (and all the things that would be welcomed on forums (such as trolling seemingly inane questions)) its decidedly not.
