  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

** Linkffn(The Arithmancer) has such a scene, but it's Hermione who does the extracting.

When the extraction ritual doesn't work they instead extract Harry's soul and let it possess Ginny, then they kill the Horcrux and put Harry's soul back.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** The [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14253384/][Power of Seven]] (*NSFW*), is porn with plot. Basically Harry figures that out in his sixth year and Hermione works her ass off finding some way to help him. She finds a ritual that needs him to bond with 7 girls (virgins? maybe?).

Stories where Harry find it himself without Hermione I can only think of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/The-Lone-Traveler/116897/99/0/1/0/0/0/0/][The Lone Traveler]] in which he uses /Finite Incantatem/ (it's a community link since it's many stories)
