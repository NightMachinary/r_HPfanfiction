I always thought it was strange how in the books Harry doesn't really treat school seriously after 1st year since VOLDEMORT is confirmed alive and hunning for his head. Is there a fic with a premise of Harry getting "scared straight" after 1st year to take his life and magic much more seriously? Doom driven I guess you could call it.

Any recommendations?

** There are lots of stories along those lines, though much less that I'd /recommend/. It's a real shame that linkffn(Forging the Sword) is apparently abandoned, because it was really developing that premise well.
