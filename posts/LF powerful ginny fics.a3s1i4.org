** I liked Ginny Weasley and Hells Portal by Sarcasma, where she rescues Harry. No special powers. Also I NEed a Hero by Strider, is vampire slayer Ginny, sadly incomplete but i live in hope. Ill add to this later.

Time travel story that has Ginny/Tom as the main pairing. It's a WIP. It does border on crack sometimes, but I still enjoyed it.

*** So that has got to be one of the most unintelligible summaries I've ever read. What's the actual plot?

**** Haha, yeah, that is true. Ginny accidentally travels to the time during which TMR attended Hogwarts. She does not fall for his charms, since she has already made that mistake before (CoC), but punches him instead - something he obviously cannot resist in the long run.

(It's not actually as cracky as my summary)

#+begin_quote
  Ginny never took Ancient Runes, but she grew up with magic seething in her sinew and coiling in her gut, and so laughter, hard and hysterical, bubbles up in her chest when she sees a precisely cut crescent moon sitting inside a pictogram of a sun.The sun marks the hours of the day, but the moon marks the passage of weeks. Months. Years. There's still shouting behind her.Ginny doesn't hesitate.
