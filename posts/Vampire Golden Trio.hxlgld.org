:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi looking for a fic I read ages ago, I've tried searching but can't find it.

Harry, Hermione and Ron get turned into vampires by a vampire that is being an obstacle for the stone in the mirror. They make a blood bank (students donate) to help other vampires (really they just drink it themselves) When harry fights Voldemort in the MOM, harry tells him not to eat garlic bread.

Sorry if that's a bit narrow, any help would be appreciated.

  After a rocky start, Harry, Ron and Hermione quickly became the best of friends. Life long friends, in fact. Some lives, however, are a lot longer than others.
