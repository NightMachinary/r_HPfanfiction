I asked something similar to this a while ago, but maybe someone will have some I haven't seen.

Are there any stories that have Harry physically being a monster similar to Alucard, Alex Mercer etc... I always like the type of moral implications that can bring up, or just a fun curb stomp story, i'm not picky. All I ask is that it's either at the point where Harry is 16ish, or over 20k words. Not saying it has to be over 20k, or he has to be 16ish. Just that I prefer it.

Thanks,

Warryn.

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.

  Harry Potter was always called a "Freak" by the Dursleys, the wizarding world often reviled him, and the muggles ignored his abuse or added to it... After all of that abuse, is it any wonder that Harry is going to make the world regret it? W!Dark Animal H

** If you want an Alucard-type, linkffn(On the Delights of Drinking Blood)

Really, just check out Quatermass' works. He has Omega!Harry (The Time Lord) and Harry as the son of Nyarlathotep in a couple other fics.

  (Bashing! Lunar Harmony Poss Harem! Crackfic!) Based on, but not a full response to, DZ2's "Eyeballs to Entrails" challenge. Abducted after his Fourth Year, Harry finds his abductor to be a most unusual person indeed: rising Queen of Magical Britain's Vampires and Pudding Club leader, Luna Lovegood. And she intends to make him her consort, an offer he is surprisingly amenable to...

*** Sorry, but I can't read Quartermass' works. I don't know what it is, but his style of writing just doesn't mesh well with me.

Thanks anyway,

**** I have this same reaction to many of that guy's stories. I remember liking the HP / Portal crossover though, so if you're desperate for something to read, give that one a shot.\\
