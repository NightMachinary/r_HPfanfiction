Explains please?

EDIT:

Seems like I made an error here. By bashing, I mean selectively and intentionally demeaning, weakening and/or taking a character's personality out of context. There is nothing wrong with changing Dumbledore or any character to fit a scenario, but when you use Harry (or any character) to function as an authors mouthpiece, then you degenerate a story into bashing AND THAT my friends in no bueno... NO BUENO AT ALL


** Many in the fandom hate Dumbledore for:

- Mishandling the Sirius Case
- Shoving Harry into an abusive household
- General incompetence in maintaining security at his School
- Not killing any Death Eater by himself
- Allowing a Death Eater to carry out murder and sabotage at his School, with a faint hope of turning the said Death Eater
- Resorting to sacrifice children in a desperate bid to stop his enemy
- Not adequately preparing his sacrifices to successfully carrying out his plan

*** I won't argue most of these, as they've been argued many times already. However, there's one that's simply factually incorrect:

#+begin_quote
  Mishandling the Sirius Case
#+end_quote

- So far as we know, Dumbledore was not the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot at the time of Sirius' arrest.

- Even if he was, it was not the Wizengamot that was in charge of Death Eater prosecutions but rather the Council of Magical Law, on which Dumbledore sat but as a regular member.

- In any case, we don't know what the Chief Warlock's responsibilities are.

- Regardless, there's no sign that any law or procedure was broken with respect to Sirius' imprisonment. We see from the GoF pensieve trials that Death Eaters are frequently tried in absentia and are brought to court only to hear their sentence.

- We know that there was some kind of collection of evidence (and thus investigation, and presumably a decision made based on that evidence) with regards to the Sirius case, because Dumbledore states that he gave evidence.

- All the evidence pointed towards Sirius being guilty anyway. Even if there was a full trial, Sirius would likely have been found guilty anyway, since at this point in time he seems to have suffered a complete mental breakdown and merely laughed insanely at everything. And even if he had broken through that insanity and raised a defence, he had no evidence: without Peter Pettigrew, his story sounds like a convenient unverifiable tale to get him off the hook. Meanwhile several people could witness to being told that Sirius would be the secret keeper, and multiple eyewitnesses stated they saw Sirius kill Pettigrew. The guy was going down regardless.

**** Are we certain Dumbledore was not the Chief Warlock at that time?

If yes, then more blame should be shifted in the direction of the Ministry.

But regardless, the Sirius Case exposed how fucked up both Dumbledore and Ministry were: You finally caught a core Voldemort henchman and a deep spy, and you didn't bother to ask him some questions? Hello Dumbledore? He was once your hardcore follower, why did he suddenly turn? Even understanding that question might save you from future similar tragedies. As for you Ministry, a core Voldemort follower would be a goldmine for intelligence, but you just locked him in a prison and forgot about him. How incompetent could you possibly get?

I like how you say this, but for that logic to follow through the justice system needed to have been flipped on its head when Lucius Malfoy entered the picture. He has probable cause. He's a pureblood who is known to spit vitriol against Muggleborns, etc... How was he not caught if the Imperius was just another unverifiable tale?

*** I'd also like to add that it completely OUTRAGED me as a child (and still does) when • at the end of the SS during the feast when Dumbledore carefully manipulates the house points system to bring Gryffindor in dead last to House Cup Champions. Of course, Harry did delay Quirrel/Voldy from obtaining the stone, and this is extremely admirable for a first year. The bravery and skill of the Golden Trio should not go unrewarded, but it's pretty fucking shitty to rob the Slytherins of the House Cup that they've been working toward for the entire year the SECOND BEFORE THEY'RE ABOUT TO BE AWARDED by just a single fucking point.

JKR made the house system into such a laughable black and white morality thing that I couldn't take it seriously by the end. I was pretty disgusted by how she had Dumbledore tell Snape that they might have sorted too soon just because he was brave - like if he had been sorted there he would have automatically been A Worthy Person. Nothing about what made him into a bitter, damaged person, nope, it is all down to house. The whole series is full of contradictions like that. "The world isn't just split into good guys and death eaters" except then lol it actually is. All Slytherins are uniformly bad even though we see very little of them. James is still lauded as an all around great guy despite being a vicious little cunt for years, but Draco never grows as a character because lol Slytherin. The Twins are outright bullies sometimes but they're in Gryffindor so it's cool, they're just having fun, only stick-in-the-muds like Percy don't "get" it.

******* Honestly it seems less like "end up a bigot" than "end up socially isolated". We know fuckall about Slytherin and most of the people in it, other than a group of them a long time ago were DEs and then some of their kids are following in those footsteps. Because we see the series through Harry, we get loads about Malfoy and his bratty junior DE gang, but not much about anyone else. Other than that they don't like Gryffindors. I can't say I blame them for that, I think if I went there, I wouldn't like them either.

What we do see of Slytherin is that the other three houses exclude them, target them, etc...meanwhile doing plenty of shitty things. And it is, at best, ignored by most of the professors. They became one-dimensional acceptable targets and that is pretty weak storytelling.

******** We see a lack of Slytherins stomping the bigot brigade flat instead of letting them define Slytherin. That's called tacit acceptance/support, at the very least.

They are acceptable targets because all we see of them is them acting like the Hitler Jugend. Of course, theoretically, they could be a fine house, unjustly persecuted by others, and the Death Eaters could be drive to desperate measures by an encroaching muggleborn wave desroying their lives.

Theoretically.

But in actual canon? Slytherins are never shown to not be the evil house. Sometimes, the Hitler Jugend really is a bunch of scumbags ready to do the bidding of their leader, and not some misrepresented bunch of poor victims.

In HP, that's the case as far as we can tell.

********* Which is part of the reason I find JKR's house system and morality lessons fairly laughable by the end. It goes from "Slytherin is the house where Draco is and we hate Draco because he is a jerk" to "Slytherin is completely evil and bad and one-dimensional". There is never any development there, the Slytherins remain a sort of cartoon bully hivemind, with the exception of Snape, who gets the whole "oooh maybe you shouldn't be one of them because you aren't totally awful and worthless as a person" anyway. Making people acceptable targets is exactly how you develop the "us and them" thing. It's how Snape ended up the person he was - Sirius Black almost murdered him and got off with a slap on the wrist, because Snape was judged less worthy.

We never see anything of them because JKR is kind of meh at pulling all her plot strings together, and sadly underuses her world. We get a zillion pages of Harry being dramatic or the angsty camping trip instead.

*********** But Slytherin isn't a political/social group that people choose to join, or are pressed into joining. The DEs are a group like that. Slytherin is a boarding school house that eleven year olds get sorted into based on characteristics the magical mind reading hat sees. We see all of Slytherin through one or two characters that the main character dislikes - Draco is a little brat and his friends are similarly awful, and Snape hates everyone (but especially Gryffindors and Harry). Slytherin as a house don't like Gryffindor or Harry, but after the points debacle in his first year, that is pretty understandable. We see nothing of the Slytherins outside of a few in Harry's year - for all we know, Draco and his gang could be their own little closed group. The DEs were a radical group, and at this point they had been "dead" for ten years, with the fanatics being a minority. Most of the Slytherins were probably the same as most of the other three houses; regular kids. Yes, over seven years they would be changed, but we don't know into what. We track one group of them, led by someone who has already been indoctrinated into the DE mindset, getting minimal and biased information.

I never understood why Harry "could have been in Slytherin", as he shows all the cunning and ambition of a bag of frozen peas. Maybe the hat was picking up on the Horcrux. Fuck knows.

I would certainly agree with [[/u/ceasare_ff]] that JKR meant for Dumbledore to have character flaws, but IMHO 1. she went way overboard with them and 2. didn't think things through and added a bunch of accidental flaws (which I wouldn't even count as 'character flaws' in the literary sense, because those have to be intentional).

Edit: Just to expand a bit on "2.": For example, she certainly meant for Dumbledore to make a difficult - and somewhat ruthless choice - by leaving Harry with the Dursleys... We could certainly accept that as a "character flaw". But that doesn't explain why Harry has to grow up thinking his loser parents died in a drunken car crash. They are heroes and sacrificed their lives for him... he deserves to know that at the very least - everything else is just needlessly cruel. Or as another example the whole Sirius deal, I'm pretty sure JKR didn't intend for that to reflect negatively on Dumbledore, but by expanding her universe she gave everyone (including Dumbledore, who has a vested interest) way too many tools and motivation to investigate the events surrounding one of the most important nights in their world. It's all these little things that add up. Why wouldn't Dumbledore pump Sirius up to the gills with Veritaserum and ask him to tell him everything he knows about Voldemort and his inner circle?

******* That's as much poor planning on her part as anything else. Tons of people have talked about the shift of Harry Potter the Fairy Tale to Harry Potter the YA novel, and Dumbledore's transformation (perception?) from/as an old wise mentor to a flawed human being is just a part of that. Again, as others have said, a big issue arises because HP is (probably) the only major orphan story where the main character leaves their abusive family but repeatedly returns to them. Mother's Basement recently briefly addressed one aspect of this, the grounding of HP in reality and the constant return to normal society (every book starts with a brief stint at the Dursleys and basically all make it clear that he's going back there). IMO these narrative constraints and shifts are primarily responsible for the common dislike of Dumbledore.

Like with many other characters in HP fanfics, I went from having my mind blown/fed by manipulative! or evil!Dumbledore fics, even though he was often incompetent, but eventually came around to liking him and appreciating fics that treat him better.

Isn't that what I've been saying? That doesn't really help me to reconcile my in-universe perspective on Dumbledore - unless I'm willing to constantly and intentionally break my own immersion when I encounter such points in the story: "Oh I guess I'll just have to ignore this, because Dumbledore isn't supposed to be evil or an idiot, so I guess it's just poor planning by the author". That just doesn't work for me at all.

It's not like I want to hate Dumbledore, I totally enjoy AU fanfics where he is the wise old mentor that he is supposed to be. It's just really hard to do convincingly without re-inventing most of canon. It's just much easier to point out what a complete joke he is and mock/bash him: It's like trying to renovate a really fucked up house, it may be possible, but is it really worth the effort?

Anything less epic could be defeated, especially in the world with Felix Felicis to guide the potential attacker.

No. Dumbledore wants to be certain that Harry is safe at all cost (and doesn't want to be personally saddled with an infant), with no regards to his happiness, so he condemns him to 10 dark and difficult years. He admits this, it's is not up for debate whether he's ruthless or not. We could debate whether or not it was the right thing to do (which JKR obviously wants us to think about - she just failed at setting up the moral dilemma properly, because Dumbledore as the greatest wizard alive, could have done a lot to make Harrys childhood more bearable, even if it's just being a secret penpal).

I'm not really sure what posseses you to think that a "the ends justify the means" argument isn't ruthlessness. Dumbledore's ruthlessness is very canon and shouldn't be a point of contention about his character (you do realise that he has a spy in Voldemort's camp and routinely lets innocent people die by not intervening in order to not expose his spy right?)

What magic giveth, magic taketh away. For every magical defense, there is a magical avenue of attack. Remember how Harry on Felix Felicis knew just what to do to accomplish his goals, and just did it, almost unconsciously? That was a /half/ dose. Now, imagine a vengeful Death Eater taking a full dose with nothing but murdering Harry Potter on his mind. It might tell him to Apparate to a nondescript patch of the forest and cast Fiendfyre in a specific direction; or it might tell him to go to Diagon Alley at a specific time and cast an Imperius on a specific person he never met before --- who turns out to be one of Harry's caretakers.

Correct. This is a (mild) form of ruthlessness. It's you who attaches (false) value judgements to ruthlessness while ruthlessness is entirely morally neutral.

There are parents who are not ruthless enough and grant their child all their wishes, because they can't bear to see them unhappy. Then there are people like Dumbledore who are extremely ruthless bordering on the sociopathic - showing no genuine empathy (except regret in hindsight). Don't forget about Emmeline Vance.

To call Dumbledore "ruthless bordering on sociopathic" because he chose Harry's safety over his happiness is absurd. As for Vance, we only have Snape's word for it, and he was motivated to lie.

Unrefuted? Untrue, I already adressed this: Absolute protection is unnecessary and unwanted. If all guardians/parents wanted absolute protection for their child they'd just put them in a golden cage (in Harry's cage it's a cage of shit, but whatever). Hemming and hawing about how powerful magic is in order to find someone kinda neglects that Dumbledore certainly has the same magnitude of magical prowess to invent countermeasures (that don't involve a black child living with KKK members). And I furthermore addressed the fact that even if I were to agree that staying with the Dursleys is necessary, there's no necessity to be so needlessly cruel to the child and completely isolate them from their heritage. Maybe check up on him occasionally? Have some small talk? Make sure they're well fed? Sneak in some necessities for the chidl if he doesn't get a lot of stuff...

  - Mishandling the Sirius Case
#+end_quote

How so? Even with Pettigrew as a Death Eater who betrayed the Potters (which Dumbledore would know), it still doesn't change the fact that as far as Dumbledore knows, Sirius killed Peter and several muggles. Sure, the trial wasn't done in tip top shape, but the war was over, and with no legal defense for Sirius, his fate was sealed. I'm thinking Dumbledore got him placed in Azkaban rather than face immediate execution, which is doubtless what many would've wanted. Only after Peter's outing would Sirius have a chance at a defense, but even then, Peter was never caught or seen until after his death.

#+end_quote

A household in the muggle world (and thus hidden by pureblood Death Eaters and sympathizers who don't know squat about how Muggles work), protected by a nigh impenetrable blood spell. Not ideal, but necessary to keep Harry safe.

#+begin_quote

  - General incompetence in maintaining security at his School
#+end_quote

Remember the prophecy. Harry is the only one that can kill Voldemort. Harry will also die in the process. Everything Dumbledore did was done to bring Harry and Voldemort together, to try and activate the prophecy.

In Stone, he tried to entrap Voldemort in Erised long enough for Harry to work his mother's blood protection and kill him. The plan worked, more or less, and it would've killed Voldemort had he no horcruxes (Dumbledore didn't figure out the exact number until later).

In Chamber, you can forgive Dumbledore for thinking the OG Tom was behind it all and not a horcrux copy. Still, the idea is the same: let fate handle Voldemort by allowing both Harry and Tom to collide.

In Goblet, Tom was up to his old tricks, and Dumbledore pretty much said so in canon that he was allowing Tom to go forward, to bring out the final conflict. However, the end duel between the two probably made him realize that the final conflict wouldn't be a knock out, drag down fight, and so he sidelined Harry while he worked out just why Voldemort couldn't stay dead.

This culminates in HBP, where he allows Malfoy to sneak in Death Eaters so that his trusty Snape can succeed him as Headmaster to continue opposing Tom. With the number of horcruxes figured out, he also gives Harry the guidance to defeat Tom once and for all.

Yes, it sucks that Harry couldn't just be a normal student. But, the prophecy was prophecy: Harry was going to have to die to kill Voldemort; and only he could kill Voldemort.

So he wasn't incompetent with school security; in Harry's six years, no one ever died (except him, of course). Sure, there was great risk, but I like to believe Dumbledore isolated the risk to just Harry and Voldemorts conflict.

#+begin_quote

  - Not killing any Death Eater by himself

That we know of. The book is seen through Harry's perspective. How do we know about the fights and duels Dumbledore had offscreen?

#+begin_quote

  - Allowing a Death Eater to carry out murder and sabotage at his School, with a faint hope of turning the said Death Eater
#+end_quote

Again, this was less about saving Malfoy (though it was a part of the plan) and more about insuring Snape's ascendance.

#+begin_quote

  - Resorting to sacrifice children in a desperate bid to stop his enemy
#+end_quote

Blame fate, not him.

#+begin_quote

  - Not adequately preparing his sacrifices to successfully carrying out his plan
#+end_quote

In Year 5, Harry's mindlink was dangerous, as we saw in the Ministry when he got possessed. It was only after that the training really started. Even then, Dumbledore knew as early as Year 4 that Harry could never compete with Voldemorts years of experience. Victory would have to come through guile, not brute force.

Here's the thing: Dumbledore was a better wizard than Voldemort. He was smarter, faster, stronger. At any point in Harry's six years, he could've easily destroyed Voldemort. But, thanks to the horcruxes, he knew that victory would only be temporary. And so, better the devil you know. That's why Riddle wasn't expunged out of Quirrel. That's why his body wasn't destroyed again in Order. And for the most part, the plan worked. Dumbledore created the conditions for the final victory.

Of course, Dumbledore isn't perfect. He's quite flawed. But he isn't evil. Far from it. He's a good man, dealt a shitty hand. And maybe he could've tempted fate and resisted, but, maybe he already tried it? We don't know much about him prior to Hogwarts, so we just don't know why he took the prophecy so seriously. All we know is, he did, and knowing his character, he did so for good reason.

"Even if I could do anything, I wouldn't. Scars can come in very useful, I have one of the London Underground on my thigh."

Wow, Dumbledore, that's great for you, but how is Harry's own scar anything like that? You said that you want him away from the fame yet keep the thing he would be most known for?

Yes, sure, we can have flawed characters. But the problem is that Dumbledore is a hundred years old and is a Wizard. Which means he should probably have enough experience to not make gigantic fuck ups like this.

But aside from that (which is honestly just cherry picking, name me one Fantasy Novel with a semi-competent adult that doesn't die), I think there isn't enough people in the fandom willing to write stories to shrug away from the ideal. We have very few Mentor!Dumbledore stories for Harry and none of them are written well. We have a couple competent!Dumbledore stories but all of them are written terribly as well. It's falling into a trap over and over again essentially, very few people can convincingly write a character that is smarter than themselves, and Rowling wasn't one of those people.

That example is just plain dumb. Calculators aren't scars and Calculators don't make you famous just when people stare at them.

*** That's the whole point though. There is nothing wrong with an incompetent Dumbeldore, it's the bashing that gets me. It's the single most off putting trope -- especially when people try to write a serious story.

Sure, you want to make a smart / cunning Harry, but you have to elevate the other characters to match that. Bashing, brings out the fact that the fic was written in retrospect. The author knows how the canon story ends; ergo, he uses that to elevate the main character while preemptively reducing another.

At any point while reading the canon, no one could say for sure how these errors would impact the story. Harry did survive in the end, (mind, I haven't read the canon in many years) so we are forced to assume --- in the end --- that Dumbledore knew what he was doing after all.

Sure, we can make him more innately powerful, but you'd have to extend the series to several books that span into well over the standard Hogwarts years or increase the number of years in Hogwarts so that it's a sort of combined Wizarding University and School, just to account for the more competent Voldemort. Which I'm not opposed to, as this can introduce my idea of Magical Specialisations and Clubs for those specialisations fairly well, and then segway into increasing the overall wizarding populace.

The greatest trick anyone ever played was making it seem like Magic was hard to do for a Prodigy, enough so that they couldn't catch up to someone greater than them in experience. I would just give Harry a mentor that's sufficiently above most in genius, make him in charge of a new subject, let's say Battle-Magic due to the threat of Dark Magic still being at an all time high due to Riddle's example. Then there's the fact that Riddle lost a lot of time due to the resurrection, Duelling has evolved and so has Spell Casting. Make Harry wanna duel more than play Quidditch and you have something to cut the tension and an easy segway between time spans, and experience, something he needs. In ten years and with a decent mentor, I'm sure he could attain enough power and magical expertise.

So many people died because of him, his beliefs, and by his followers, and Dumbledore saw all of it first-hand, especially since he knew Tom from when he first met him in the orphanage. Can we really blame Dumbledore that he tried to architect Harry, the one who was prophesied to mark the fall of Voldemort, into seeing the end of the Dark Lord? Yes, Dumbledore is manipulative, but he was due to him wanting to see the betterment of the wizarding community in Great Britain. I think many FanFiction readers/writers fail to see just how much of a problem Voldemort was, especially with many calling him Mr. Noseless, or Moldy-Shorts, or something foolish like that.

It's like bringing about the end of Hitler before/during WWII (as JK Rowling has compared Voldemort to Hitler before). It would have to be a plan that is calculating, but something that has to be carefully planned and carried out. One flaw would send the entire preparation into disarray.

What if Harry hadn't disarmed Draco? What if Ron hadn't miraculously become a parselmouth at the most convenient time?)

******* You're missing the part where Harry /has/ to die so that Voldemort can die, because of the scarcrux. Because Voldemort uses Harry's blood in the resurrection ritual, he tethers Harry to life - resulting in Harry living when hit with the Killing Curse for the second time - but even if Harry wasn't going to live afterwards, it would be a sacrifice I'm hoping that people would understand, in order to save more people.

The issue with utilitarianism as I've described it is that it is utterly impersonal, and cruel. If you're the poor sod that has to die so that the other guy can die and the world can be saved from calamity, it's certainly a very shit deal for you. However, it's also - if we assume that saving people is a good thing and not to be avoided because of, say, overpopulation - a /necessary act/.

Because I can't be bothered to write two replies, here's my response to [[/u/jedimasterneo][u/jedimasterneo]].

I was brought up to do the right thing, and my family would all gladly make such a sacrifice - to not do so is beyond selfish. If I lived at that time, and was presented with absolute proof that my life was also keeping Hitler alive, and killing Hitler was an aim we wanted, I'd kill myself in a heartbeat, and I hope most people would too.

/No one is worth any more than anyone else, in general, in the long run. The only thing that matters on a larger scale is numbers. One life for thousands? Millions? If, as I've suggested above, that saving people is the thing you want to do, something that you believe in, then there isn't a choice./

I would argue that the enshrining of the rights of the individual is an equally slippery slope, and therefore something like Dumbledore's actions can't be argued on a principle-based basis. IMO it has to be looked at in context.

The issue is not criticising Dumbledore, but /bashing/ him. Bashing is dumb, because the author writes deliberately stupid caricatures of actual people in order to highlight their stupid decisions, the stupid decisions of course being ones the author /makes/ them take. For example, some people write in a get-out-of-jail-free function for getting rid of the scarcrux, so that Dumbledore looks like a weirdo obsessed with sacrificing children, when if that were possible in canon surely Dumbledore would've done it in a heartbeat rather than set Harry up to die. Bashing is cheap and removes the need for authors to add depth, reason, or any human charactersitics to their characters, all for the sake of cheap "ha ha they're stupid now look at Harry/whoever ROFLstomp them" moments.

Harry /has/ to die for the piece of Voldemort's soul in his scar to die. There is, according to canon, no other way of destroying a Horcrux other than destroying its container, or if the container is living, killing it. If it were possible to remove the Horcrux without killing Harry then Dumbledore would've done so. Harry's survival through Voldemort's use of his blood - at least that's what I understand for it - is a happy coincidence, but if Harry was going to die and stay dead /it would still be the right thing to do/.

It's perfectly possible that despotism and abuse of human rights occurs in the name of the majority, but if we're arguing about the good of a society, group or majority, you cannot view them as individuals, because that narrows your perspective. Oppression of the minority by the majority is /exactly what democracy is/, because everyone who didn't vote for the government in question end up being ruled over anyway, yet it's still viewed as the fairest system currently in existence because it caters to the largest possible majority of people - those that speak their opinions, anyway, or don't have something like the US Electoral College to fuck them over.

/Bashing isn't natural, it's childish./ Proper, considered criticisms of characters' actions and motivations, or presenting new perspectives are natural. Whining and writing a stupid, hilariously idiotic version of a character to point out how stupid they were in canon (when the idiotic version that's been created is /nothing/ like canon) only serves to point out the author's immaturity.

Not only that but many fanfiction writers are people in their teens to early adulthood, and their youth and mentality about life can very easily show through in their writing.

Many of the points made throughout this post are the exact reasons why he gets bashed. And while you or others can come up with reasons why that logic is flawed, thats the thing in the authors eyes It is not flawed, it is perfectly reasonable and accurate to how they see the character.

Now as for why i read bashing stories its just because i dont care. I generally sit counter to most of this sub, character in name only as long as it is enjoyable to me is something i will read with no complaints, i also like simple (or as others would say mediocre) good guy wins stories.

I dont really care about Dumbledore, i didnt like the way he treated the situations throughout the cannon narrative and unless an author makes him out of character in a more grandfatherly mentor kind of way, i want as little Dumbledore in my fanfics as possible but when he shows up if he is a villain then sure why not. If the author wants to make him less intelligent or more blatantly a bad guy i just dont care that often, especially since Bashed/Dumbledore as a villain usually leads to an easier or more flashy/overpowering "good guy wins" scenario.

** From what I've seen, there are, loosely, two main motivations for Dumbledore bashing:

1. To glorify Harry. Because, rather than leaving Harry at the Durzkaban (TM), suppressing his potential to be the next coming of Merlin, and Grooming (TM) and Manipulating (TM) him into sacrificing himself; Dumbledore should have Trained (TM) Harry to fight Voldemort using all sorts of Dark Arts, while raising him on Ayn Rand books (to make sure he wouldn't sacrifice himself for anyone) and finding him a harem.

2. To glorify Slytherins. Because, you see, Slytherins are just a little bit tribal, but that's understandable, since everybody else --- especially Dumbledore --- hates them, and wishes that they would all just curl up and die. In reality, they are more accepting than Hufflepuffs, cleverer than Ravenclaws, and less blood-prejudiced than Gryffindors.

Quotes from he books:

#+begin_quote
  He was bearing down on Harry like a great bulldog, all his teeth bared. “Well, I've got news for you, boy. . . . I'm locking you up. . . . You're never going back to that school . . . never . . . and if you try and magic yourself out --- they'll expel you!” And laughing like a maniac, he dragged Harry back upstairs. Uncle Vernon was as bad as his word. The following morning, he paid a man to fit bars on Harry's window. He himself fitted a cat-flap in the bedroom door, so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day. They let Harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening. Otherwise, he was locked in his room around the clock. Now that the Dursleys knew they weren't going to wake up as fruit bats, he had lost his only weapon. Dobby might have saved Harry from horrible happenings at Hogwarts, but the way things were going, he'd probably starve to death anyway. The cat-flap rattled and Aunt Petunia's hand appeared, pushing a bowl of canned soup into the room. Harry, whose insides were aching with hunger, jumped off his bed and seized it.

That was the starving part.

Quotes from the books:

#+begin_quote
  Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise -- unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry.

  Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could. "Out of the way, you," he said, punching Harry in the ribs.

  Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley's gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley's favorite sport: Harry Hunting.
#+end_quote

And there's much more where that came from. It took my 5min to find this much evidence.

And another thing, He lives in a FUCKING Cupboard. IT IS CANON. Need I quote this?

I also like how Dumbledore left him in a cold night on a doorstep with nothing more than a letter and a blanket. Also Canon. Need I go on?

I never said Harry didn't have a shitty life, or that the Dursleys weren't assholes What I said if you had cared to read (because I guess you can read right?) is that fanfiction authors literally overblow the kind of abuse Harry lived with

#+end_quote

so they were feeding him three times a day and letting him go to the bathroom two times a day? how does that compare with the common FF Cliche where Harry is skin and bones and hasn't eaten in three weeks?

#+begin_quote
  *The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he'd never been allowed to eat as much as he liked.* Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if It made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious.

The never starved him, not in the first book anyway, as your quote confirms it, but I think they did starve him in the second book. I mean they fed him canned soup. At least it was 3 times a day.

******** Robst is a very prolific Harry/Hermione author which is famous for his cliched stories,

I think people seem to ignore that the most important thing for the Dursleys was appearances, what would their teachers say (and the neighbors!) if Harry showed up to school starved and all beaten up. that's why they didn't starve him and that why they didn't beat him like in fanon.

Also, I have second-hand knowledge of starving (kind of), my mother was poor she had 13 brothers and sisters, my grandpa was a painter (he painted walls and the like) and my grandma was a seamstress, they barely made enough money to feed all their children.

My mom has told me what it feels to go to sleep after two days of no eating anything. it's something I wouldn't wish upon anyone. that's why her priority had always been to put food on our tables and making sure we never went to bed hungry. I see how it affected her even though it wasn't as severe as someone living, say, in Africa or the like.

Maybe that's why this kind of overblown cliches make me so angry, they are probably written by someone who had never gone to sleep with their stomach empty. (not that I ever did)

********* I full well know what it feels to starve, I have had a couple of situations where I ate once every 3 days. My parents were divorced, and my mother(I lived with her) was going through some rough times. I had a little sister too. Most of the food went to her, so she would not have to suffer hunger. She was kept in the dark about our money problems.Tried to help where I could(helping the neighbors for pocket change. It's all better now, so that's nice). You feel less hungry when you're distracted. Drinking plenty of water(if possible helps too).

********* 14 children eh? Not saying you're lying, but that's pretty improbable. This site I found lists households with seven+ people grouped together as 5% of the population in 1976. Your mother's household allegedly had 16 people. That's a vast difference. I would put households that had 16 people as less than 0.001% of the population, probably less, as 0.001% would still be nearly 200 households. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_with_the_most_children][This Wikipedia page]] of people with the most children stops the list at 20, so I assume there are too many people with less children than that to bother listing them all, or that 20 was just a convenient stopping point. Either way, I find it /highly/ unlikely that your mother was in a family of 16 individuals.

********** That's rural Mexico in the 1940~1950 for you, lack of access to contraceptives, being Catholic, and the fact that women were expected to have children as long as they could, may have something to do with it

also, two of my uncles were actually adopted (one was left on her doorstep the other her biological mother died and my grandma took care of him since he was 5)

My parental grandma had 9 children (all male) but they were actually well off as they owned several gas stations

I find it weird you mention it's so rare as I have talked with friends from my age group (born in the 80's) and they all had grandparents with 6-14 children.

Maybe is somthing cultural?

*********** I suppose, but my paternal grandparents only had 5, and they're Catholic, while my maternal grandparents had 2 (maternal-maternal great grandparents [as in, my mother's mother's parents] had 8, maternal-paternal had 1) and they're Baptist.

I've asked some of my friends, and none of them know people in their family who had any more children than 10. That would be in rural Alabama, since my friends' families have lived in the area for decades. My father's family is from farther north, but they moved to Florida at least 50 years ago, and my mother's family is from rural Tennessee/Georgia, and although the extended family is quite large, no individual family had more than 8 or 9, and that's fallen rapidly in the last two generations or so to just 1-4 kids per family.

Adoption makes a bit more sense, to me, and with lower quality healthcare I would assume that your chance of death during childbirth increases with the number of births.

I can only assume it's something regional/cultural. I found paper on Mexican family structure, but it's locked behind a paywall and I don't feel like taking the time to find a free version. All I was really able to find is that the average family size is 4.3 people, and I'm not sure how recent that is, or whether it includes the parents.

******** Robst is pretty good writer, but a terrible author. Hence why I gave Harry Crow a try despite the fact people were telling me it was a terrible story. Take something thing like Angry Harry and the Seven or Three to Backstep and double that. That is how cliche riddled his stories are.

Personally, I don't recommend his stories.

Not to sound spoiled, but canned soup for all 3 meals of the day isn't very healthy. I'd still venture to call it starving Harry, and if not, then depriving him of a proper range of nutrients.
