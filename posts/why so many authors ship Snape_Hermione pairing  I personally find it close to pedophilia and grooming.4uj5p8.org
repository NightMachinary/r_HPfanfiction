Snape was an adult in his middle ages when Hermione was a 11 yr old girl stepping into Hogwarts and he had seen her growing up all the way into adulthood..Also,Snape neither likes her or dislikes her..He just treated her as another student..

Is there any reason why so many authors choose this pairing when they could have used an adult woman to pair with Snape?

*** Yeah, society tends to be accepting of women who date older men and older men who date younger women. Not as accepting for the reverse.

To answer OP's question from a reader's view, when I read SS/HG, I am not looking for literary excellence or in character portrayals. I'm reading a romance novel stand-in somewhat set in the HP world with characters that only have a passing resemblance to canon.

** I personally love HG/SS pairings, but the ones i usually see involve time travel, usually Hermione going back to the marauder era, though occasionally future Hermione getting tossed back into her Hogwarts era body. But, I've said it before and I'll probably say it again, any ship can be believable if it is well written. The key is finding an author who can show the progress of the relationship, address the issues, such as Hermione being an annoying know-it-all, and Severus being reclusive and bitter, and show how the characters grow and work through these issues. That's actually the reason that I don't like soul mate / magical bond fics, because they just throw the character together, add some magic, and suddenly the /love/ each other... Also, I don't have anywhere near the issue that most people do with the age gap, because my husband is 16 years my senior (and only two years younger than my mother, since she was a young mom). I actually relate batter to him and his friends than I do to people that are my age, so I get why a girl like Hermione would be interested in an older man.

**** Linkffn(Come Back To Me by ChristinaFay) Kind of an odd take on things, but I highly enjoyed it. There's quite a bit of set-up in the beginning, but it comes together nicely.

Linkffn(Of Myth and Magic) Takes place in the muggle world, completely AU, but a really good read.

Linkffn(Pride of Time) actually a time turner send Hermione to the marauders era fic, but it continues into Harry's era when Hermione has to slot herself back into her old life. Has an alternative ending (Divide of Time) that was also enjoyable.

I swear there was at least one more that I liked, but I can't find it.

***** I've always thought it was unrealistic that nobody at Harry's school, that his parents went to 20 years previously, where most of the staff are the same due to being long-lived, would mention to poor orphan Harry, who is also a hero to the wizarding world in general, any fond memories of either of his parents, or point him in the direction of any of their friends he might want to catch up with. I know even when I was in high school, teachers would recognize familiar surnames and ask if we knew so-and-so who was usually an aunt, uncle or older cousin, and tell a joke or story about them. I'm not sure I could believe that every single student - both in her year, and those above or below - who was in Hogwarts at the same time as Lily was would have been tragically killed in the war.

Or if I'm being very cynical and reading in something that JKR almost definitely didn't intend, it's very unfortunate that Harry's teachers and Order members are happy to tell him stories about his rich, pureblooded father, but no-one will point him in the direction of any of his muggleborn mother's schoolfriends or tell him stories about her when she was younger. I don't believe in any of the canon books we get a clear mention of who Lily's friends were apart from Snape.

It makes sense in an older fashioned society, in which the age of adulthood is 17 (and 17 year olds really are really adults). Factor in a tiny dating pool, ~10k, especially for "brainy" people for whom most people won't get them.

People frequently shave a year or two off of Snape's age, and considering they could easily have another 100 years in front of them, yes, a 16 year gap seems reasonable.

** I'm generalizing, but SSHG writers tend to be middle aged women who have some writing talent/capability.

The best SSHG I've come across are wonderfully written and engrossing to read. Authors make it clear that Hermione is of age before anything actually happens, either biologically or through her PoA Time Turner use.

Also considering Wizarding lifespans, 19 years doesn't seem that much.

I like romances that start off as tentative friendships and slowly develop into romances. Novel-length SSHG gives me that.

HG's first love interest was Victor Krum, someone who was awkward, surly, not handsome, but talented. These characteristics also describe Snape to some extent.

Alan Rickman doesn't have much to do with me liking Snape as a character; I never really found him attractive.

In this ship, I prefer time travels, MLC fics in which HG turns to SS as an alternative/source of support, or post DH EWE stories.

The premise of the Snape Chronicles is that Harry's perspective is biased, as is Snape's. We have no clue what girls think of him, and the Snape-Harry relationship is very different than the others.

Why wasn't another adult woman used? There weren't many fleshed out. Trelawney and McGonnagall are unfeasible for obvious reasons.

***** If Dumbledore sat his OWLs at age 15, roughly 1896, then Griselda Marchbanks was at least 117 in /OotP/. Aunt Muriel was 102, right?

And Bathilda Bagshot was adult enough to host her nephew Grindlewald in 1898-ish. So when she died in 1997, she was, what, 125-ish? She is probably the upper limit of aging, though. She was pretty far gone by the time Skeeter pumped her for information, if I recall correctly.

Unless we're going by the completely non-canon idea that the stronger one is magically the longer they'll live.

** I think you are taking a short sighted view of this pairing. It would be problematic if instituted within canon (or canon era timeline) however this is fan fiction. It's the Wild West and absolutely anything is possible. SS/HG is my OTP but my preference for stories is EWE, AU (necessarily) Post DH adventure and there are plenty of stories that fit the bill.

Anyone who has a ship perceives something in its members they believe would attract the pair. You can't always explain that satisfactorily to someone else because their perceptions of the characters are shaped by the lens of their personal experience (both in life and in reading the source material).

We often see people complain about Snape/Hermione pairings but I've never seen anyone complain about Remus/Hermione. Yet the males are both 19 years her senior. Of modest means. One scarred, one is ugly... are they so disparate? The difference is in how the characters are /generally/ perceived. Another example of this is Colonel Brandon marrying Mary-Anne in Sense and Sensibility. We sigh and say "how romantic", but the age difference between the two characters is /exactly/ the same as between Snape and Hermione.

Whats 20 years if you're going to live another 100? I'm 11 years older than my husband and we don't even have that luxury.

** Yes, it's a bit creepy, and extremely unlikely, but a lot of authors get around it by using things like the "marriage law" challenge that went around ages ago. (There's a law about marriage in the wizarding world! Hermoine and Snape /have/ to get married. Take it from there.) Personally, I liked reading stories in that vein that challenged the worst tropes and took in what would realistically happen in that extreme situation. Rather a dark topic, but interesting.

As for both of them just falling in love, the only one I can think of that I enjoyed was linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4110540/1/Good-as-Gold]]) Good As Gold, which thoroughly removed everything from school times by a decade or so and did a good job of keeping things humorous while, if I recall, still addressing those past events.

In general, though, I believe most authors who write SS/HG do choose an adult woman--they choose adult Hermione.

** Wow, there's a lot of hate for SS/HG here. As an occasional reader, I can tell you the following:

- 1) I only ever read SS/HG where Hermione is over 18. So when anything romantic begins, Hermione is an adult. The fics I like the most are quite a while post war, so that each of them have had time away from the teacher/student dynamic.
- 2) In canon, Snape is demonstrated to be an extremely intelligent, and socially awkward young man. Hermione, while a bit less socially awkward, is very similar. They are misfits, they are passionate about academic subjects, they have trouble making friends. When needed, they're both willing to be ruthless, and do what needs to be done, even if it might hurt other people's feelings, or be morally/ethically questionable. They both have a cruel streak, although Snape's is of course much, much wider. They both sacrifice a lot for the sake of the war. They both have a sarcastic point of view. In my view there's quite a few similarities for the two of them to be a plausible couple.
- 3) Hermione is one of the few who ever believes in Snape, or gives him the benefit of the doubt, which is pretty essential for there to be ever friendship, much less romance.
- 4) I personally find it tough to understand the HG/RW or HG/HP dynamic. I think Hermione and Ron are too dissimilar in terms of interests, intellect, and personality to fit, and the Hermione and Harry are just too sibling like for me to believe. The next biggest pairings, with the widest variety of fics are DM/HG, and SS/HG, both of which I read.
- 5) Snape is such an intriguing, interesting character, with so much backstory. Most HG/SS fics delve into this backstory, as Snape slowly opens up to HG.
- 6) In terms of other het pairings with Snape - McGonagall is quite old, Tonks wants Remus (and makes sense with him)...and what other single women are there?\\
- 7) There's quite a lot of really fantastic writing out there for this pairing. Maybe because Snape appealed to the type who likes Heathcliff and Mr. Rochester, and that group of writers was a bit older than the typical fanfic writers (especially back in 2006 ish, when I first got into the pairing), there are quite a few well written fics.
- 8) I just really want Snape to have a happy ending. Snape deserves happiness after all he's been through. And nobody else is ever going to give him a chance.

**** And I'd say that people are keeping things very fictional.

In some ways, HG is a self-insert for brainy female fans, and Snape stands in for any brooding anti-hero. Considering most of the writers are women, some of whom are young enough to think 16 is mature, and others who are old enough that their self-insert Hermione is 30, it kind of makes sense.

Some fics deliberately give Hermione more power to counterbalance it.

For me its like how some romance novels are fun and some are disgustingly heteronormative, and frankly reinforce rape culture.

** First of all, anyone shipping Snape with /anything/ aside from the Giant Squid is visualizing Alan Rickman, so already we're well out of character. Realizing that, the authors putting him with Hermione are likely using adult Emma Watson as their template, though there's a good chance that Hermione is merely their hero name, with a secret identity of [author as they wished they were].

Add in thematic elements of any period romance novel (fussiness over propriety, angsty protests of wrongness and sudden revelations/moral breakdowns whilst both characters are conveniently isolated from all possible witnesses) and we're off to the races.

Yes, he's powerful and confident and difficult to please- that's what the linked article pointed out, aside from the power of Rickman's hypnotic voice. In my own hyperbolic way, I was suggesting that fanfiction often shifts our view of the characters towards a more appealing ideal.

  If you take the Harry-Blinders off, there's no reason why a Snape-shipper's mental picture of him must be that of Alan Rickman.
#+end_quote

While there's no reason for that (for the mental picture) and I am quite certain that enough writers write without such a mental picture, many an adolescent fanfic author writing such a pairing do have this image. This is why the pairing is “so popular”, comparatively speaking, as I won't say that the fact that it exists at all is a sign of anything (because people pair anyone with anyone---or anything---without any deeper reason), but for what there is to it it is quite a popular pairing and /that/ is because of some people having that mental picture.

Seriously, though, it's the same with anyone/Draco: the statistics are skewed due to how the actor playing the latter looked. Some people do genuinely want to write a good story featuring Draco and do their research, which sometimes happens to succeed and sometimes happens to be a story with a pairing and on occasions both of those, but as it tends to be many people writing stories with pairings ... well, yeah, I'm sure you know how it often is and so I won't rant about it.

His last request, with his dying breath, was to look at her eyes once more - by asking Harry to look him in the eye. Snape was an extraordinarily complex character - yet the choices he made, especially after the Prophecy was revealed to Voldemort, reflected that he loved Lily dearly - in his own way.

** The age gap is problematic. People tend to address this by making Hermione abnormally mature.

The second large problem is relative positions of power. Snape can assign detentions and take house points and order Hermione around, and she has no way to appeal his decisions. All she can do is run away from school -- which might be legal if she'd passed her OWLs at that point, or might get her wand snapped.

Compare if she dated a fellow student. If the person was a prefect, they could take house points, but Hermione could appeal to McGonagall, and the person would likely lose their position. Otherwise, Hermione could appeal to a prefect if unpleasant things were going on in the relationship and she needed protection.

We're also talking about Snape, and he's portrayed as petty, grudge-bearing, and bad at controlling himself. So he would definitely abuse his authority the moment he thought Hermione did something to hurt him.

A good example of this is /The Problem with Purity/.
