I saw a lot of posts like that but you can't answer most of them, so I made mine. I would change several things. I may edit to add more

1.  Add more teachers at Hogwarts. It is not humanly possible for 10 teachers to teach more than 1,000 children
2.  Add Muggle subjects and modify the original subjects. Flight lessons become Physical Education and they learn more sports and some Muggle sports. Muggle studies are a must for everyone and teach how to live among Muggles, camouflage between Muggles and more.
3.  Competitions between schools. Play Quidditch and other sports between schools. Make sure schools have a unique team in addition to the team in each home (you can participate in both)
4.  Azkaban is the worst of the worst prisons. There are other prisons in the wizarding world that try to make prisoners become good people.
5.  If they know who Muggle-borns are to send them letters, let parents know since the child's birth that the child is a wizard and the parents decide when to reveal it to the child.
6.  Create a Child and Adolescent Statute to protect child witches who are abused at home. It's unacceptable that they don't have it
7.  Create more extracurricular activities. A school newspaper, perhaps more than one in which people tell random news and give tips on how to do schoolwork and such. As suggested by [[/u/NotSoSnarky][u/NotSoSnarky]], perhaps a random Ask Me section, where students ask student journalists questions and they answer. Also courses in other things, like art
8.  More parties. The Christmas party is the last day of school before Christmas so students don't have to stay in school all winter just for a party. Halloween parties entitled to student costumes, Easter parties where children hunt eggs at school and such
9.  More janitors and coordinators in schools. Look at the size of hogwarts, there's no way for Filch to take care of that whole thing
10. Muggle electronic devices at hogwarts, there is only internet in the common room of each house and they are different passwords. Place a TV in each common room, where they can watch the news and magic movies that air on open channels. Wizarding films with wizarding actors. Suggested by [[/u/danirose212][u/danirose212]], make electronic gadgets magical. Create a wizard Google that is much faster and more efficient than spending hours in the library looking for some information.
11. Wizarding social networks are a good idea. I know that Harry Potter is set in the 90s when there wasn't much internet, but it's 2021. Daily Prophet can be both a virtual and physical newspaper at the same time, just like student newspapers at Hogwarts. And of course, some students would start their own blog about random things. Student blogs can be about studies, fashion, Quidditch, newspapers and stuff


** I think it would be amusing to go back in time and trick Voldemort into being good, my argument is:

Look, even if you conquer Britain, what are you going to do then? You're going to have to watch your back for the rest of your days, and all your time will be spent running the damn country and that sounds boring, plus without the muggleborn? Who will work the minimum wage jobs?

Instead pass a law that anyone serving on the wizengamot can't hold any other job, because they need to always be available for any crisis involving the wizard of world, Also any members need to pay extra money in addition to taxes each year (Voldemort likes because it keeps non rich muggleborn and half bloods from serving without being so discriminatory that they rebel against it).

Expand diagon alley using space expansion charms and add more shops, keep the pure bloods happy by letting them know first that properties are going up for sale so they can buy them. Appease the muggleborn by leasing the properties and have the pure bloods sponsor new companies in return for shares.

Basically trick everyone into thinking that they're screwing over the other side and cackle in glee as there's a technology boom in the wizard of world.

** More inter house friendships. Maybe working together on school projects, etc.

Start a Hogwarts Newspaper. Something like a random Ask Me and they give out helpful responses, etc.

Add more teachers is a good idea. Having the Pureblood and Halfbloods be better equiped at being able to manevour around the Muggle World would be a good idea.

Start a Tutoring session for people who need it. (Which could also help inter-house friendships develop).

** Hello, some of that is dumb, but some is great.

1. THAT MAKES SO MUCH SENSE.
2. Why tho? Wizards most likely have potions to stay in good shape? Who the hell would live with muggles when you can live in a much more comfortable society that is also more advanced. You change the original subjects to make them better, not incorporate muggle stuff in it. Only give Aurors camaflouge training, no one else requires it. I disagree with this so much, why the hell do basic foreigners cause the major school in a country to change? Muggleborns are foreigners to the magic world even if they both are named Britain. Muggle sports all fail in comparison to quidditch so the sports idea is dumb. Lastly for this point, wizards have no need for phys ed, i personally find the subject useless how will wizards feel about that when they have better things to do thn attend a useless class.
3. Makes sense
4. Makes sense
5. I do not believe they know and I think it would be better to have a teacher do it as muggle parents with no knowledge will not be able to comprehend how to explain magic. If a parent is abusive they will never reveal and if they go with that system lazy wizards will forget about the child. If it is a set system the chances of abuse stopping a child from going is low.

** 1. I'd promote more inter-house friendships and overall unity. It's ridiculous that a quarter of the school is demonized, another quarter is ridiculed as "duffers," and all four are up to their eyeballs in stereotypes. I liked the idea someone else had of being sorted into two houses, where you sleep and eat with one and attend classes with the other.

2. I'd also figure out exactly what influence the Ministry has over the Daily Prophet and try to add competitors so the market isn't so ridiculously monopolized. Also, do slander and libel laws exist???

3. I'd also add an "Intro to the Magical World" class to Hogwarts - how does the government work? What are your rights? How are the countries of the world organized? How do ordinary witches and wizards live?

4. Definitely add more teachers and muggle subjects, especially things like sociology and psychology. They make you more aware of the falliability of your own nature as a human. More electives!! Dueling, home economics, healing, etc.

5. Allow students to stay on at Hogwarts over the summer. Hogwarts could offer summer courses so students from abusive and neglectful homes can get out.

Sorry for the essay, haha. Your post got me really excited :')

** 1. More teachers and subjects at hogwarts
2. Regarding subjects, ensure students actually have a well rounded education to set them up for success in the real world, besides just DAD, and charms.... real math classes, more history, muggle related items
3. More sports
4. More wizarding schools that the 3 in Europe / 1 in America
5. WizRding university to actually study the subject you want to chose, rather than being hiring at like 17
6. More wizarding jobs (it seems there is professor, auror, work for the ministry, or own a small business)
7. Wizarding grade school prior to 11 years old
8. More use of muggle items such as cell phones, tv, and laptops. Maybe make them magical?

Ok that's all for now :)

** Change it in general to improve things - or change it as a setting for interesting stories?

Because that does make different things happen ;)

For the latter, I think I would mostly go about adding a layer of worldbuilding above what's already there. JKR was self-admittedly terrible at numbers and scale, and a lot of what she did came in a book to book manner. So stuff like increasing the size and population of the WW, adding more schools and professors, etc would all fall under that.

I would also completely revamp the non-British world - I find the current implementation lazy and boring, and with the books' focus on the british isles it leaves a lot of room to do other things. So stuff like changing up the borders to match those at the time of the SoS (or earlier!), other powerful magical governments doing their own thing in their own way, varied cultures, etc - a bit much to put here, but the goal there is to have unique societies instead of boring ones.

** - British Wizarding World -

Obligatory Imperius among muggle highest officials or curse every possible important muggle position to benefit Wizardkind.

Teach how most part of the muggle world is suffering while some part of them are benefitting from the suffering areas. Teach how muggles are destroying Earth to enjoy their toys.

Teach how muggles kill each other enthusiastically, how they killed possibly more than Wizardkind on earth on their last large conflict(60 ~ 80mil).

Obligatory surveillance among all muggle-born children. If muggles dare to abuse magical children, they will be tried by the Wizard Court which will be clearly biased against muggles, and children would be relocated to the Wizarding family. All cases of abuse would be published to the Wizarding population.

Publish ongoing witch-hunts in the less developed world. Obligatory study of muggle world's discriminations: Gender, Skin color, etc.

[Aim: Prevent muggleborns from claiming all wizards should follow muggle's footsteps, and try to make wizards think like muggles]

If Statute does not ban Wizards from earning money in the muggle world, Set up a wizarding corporation to exploit muggles by MoM. Use Arithmancy, Divination, Reparo, etc. to earn muggle money, buy raw materials, and then use those to provide a comfortable life to average wizarding citizens since not everyone is proficient in magic, although powerful wizards cannot suffer from a material deficit,

- International Confederation of Wizards -

ICW must prepare for the possible scenario of muggle destroying the Earth too much. More infiltration among Muggle governments, etc.

​

etc.

**** Ambition and blood purity are already a bad combination of traits that's just asking to perpetuate bigotry and prejudice (not to mention likely being intertwined w/ classism and elitism) and grow wizard Hitlers like Voldemort, and that's only pulling f/ two out of the three main tenets of Slytherin that the Hat talks about. Add in fanon's common approaches to cool-ifying and "fixing" Slytherin House, and you get a veritable breeding ground for Death Eaters and for permission structures that enable justifying apathetic bystanding.

***** But how is blood purity one of the Slytherin House traits? Sure, a lot of them are Blood Purists, but there's exceptions, and the same holds true for the other Houses.

Andromeda Tonks was a Slytherin, Merlin was a Slytherin, etc. Cunning and ambition doesn't necessarily mean bigotry.

****** Blood purity is literally stated to be something Salazar Slytherin valued and selected for by the Sorting Hat, and it's mentioned many times across the books as something Salazar Slytherin preferred wizards w/ purer blood---and the Slytherin House of the books clearly has no problem w/ that.

A small few exceptions don't disprove the rule, especially considering how minor a character Andromeda is and that Merlin being a Slytherin is one of those trivia nuggets Jo dropped years (here, iirc, seven after DH was published) after the fact. Slughorn is the only substantial good Slytherin character, and even he doesn't exactly respond constructively or w/ self-reflection when Harry calls him out for making an implicitly blood purist offhand remark in HBP. And this---

---is straight-up straw-manning. I made it inordinately clear in my earlier comment that ambition /and blood purity/ are the bad combination of traits that breed bigotry and prejudice. An environment that values ambition /and also/ throttles exposure to a disadvantaged group is going to be fertile grounds for those kinds of societal ills.

And "What's sex like in the wizarding world?" It doesn't strictly "change" things, but it pushes at the ordinary stuff like your question does.

** Have the hat sort the first years, and whichever House the kid ends up in that year is just where he/she /starts/. The next year, the children rotate into the next House, and they learn to focus on that House's specialty. Gryffindors become Hufflepuffs become Ravenclaws become Slytherins. At the end of your 4th year, you decide which house you're going to spend your remaining 3 years in. House rivalries are pointless because everyone was everything and children go back to just being children, and learn to look at each other as individuals.
