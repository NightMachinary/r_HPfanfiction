** There was a decent one on Ao3 recently where Breath of the Wild Link ended up slaying the dementors at the beginning of OotP. Then he goes to Hogwarts and it gets weird. But it was just him, though. linkao3(13889202)

  Link and Zelda's lives after Calamity weren't easy, but they were making it work. But disaster strikes when monsters pour through an old weakness between worlds, and the Master Sword is the only thing that can stop them. Only, when Link goes to combat this new threat, he winds up somewhere he should never have been. Harry could never have guessed what his fifth year would bring.

** I'm interested to see what this turns up (sorry I have no recommendations) but are there any where Harry is in the Zelda universe?
