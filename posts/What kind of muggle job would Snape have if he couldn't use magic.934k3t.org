********* He didn't ask Voldemort to kill Harry and James, c'mon. Voldemort was going to do that anyway.

If he had asked for Voldemort to spare Harry- the kid prophesied to defeat Voldemort- how well do you really think that would've gone over? Voldemort would've looked at him... "So, Severus, you wish for me to be defeated? Avada Kedavra!" ... and that would have been the end of Snape.

If he had asked for Voldemort to spare Lily and James, that would have looked weird as hell to all his friends who had been in Slytherin right there with him and knew how they hadn't gotten along.

If you want to think Snape was calculating about this, the only person he had a believable reason to ask Voldemort to spare was Lily. But what did he do after asking Voldemort? He went to Dumbledore. Now, Dumbledore is the one who chastises Snape for not asking for Harry and James' lives to be saved. But again, if you believe Snape is being calculating about this... how fucking stupid would Snape have to be to think Dumbledore wouldn't save the whole family. You just told him about a kid destined to take out Voldemort and begged him to save the kid's mom. Do you really, truly think DD is gonna leave the kid to be killed because you didn't beg for the kid's life /specifically/? No, Dumbledore is the "save everybody" option. Just by going to him Snape knows Harry and James are included.

--------------

Edit: But... I don't think Snape was calculating at all. He's like a mother watching a school bus teetering at the edge of a cliff.

"Save my baby!" the mother screams.

Does anyone jump on her because she didn't shout "Save my baby, and also John, Billy, Sally, Joe, Trisha and the names of the other 67 kids on the bus!"?

No, of course not. Does it mean she is actively wishing for those kids to die or wouldn't give a shit about them if she did stop to think? No, she just has tunnel vision because she cares so fucking much about her own child. And that's the way Snape is- hyper-focused on Lily. He's not paying attention to anything else.

I just think that Harry and James fall into that latter category and Dumbledore was acting stupidly to chide him about it. Asking Voldemort for their lives would have been counterproductive at best and fatal at worst. Snape acted to attempt to save them by going to Dumbledore, whether he gave a shit about them personally or not. Asking Voldemort for Lily's life was more like an insurance policy in case Dumbledore failed.

Dumbledore has to remind Snape that the infant and husband should be saved too, especially because Lily would be pissed if they weren't, and Snape basically says “well if you must protect them, fine.”

You state this like he asked Voldemort to kill them in the first place just so he can have Lily. He just ends up freaking out and begging for Lily life only when he realizes that her family is the target. I don't think that is the same as going up to Voldemort and telling him of how there is this Potter family and how the husband and the child are a danger and need to be killed. It's still bad that he doesn't care about Lily s child and husband or that he fed info to Voldemort in the first place, but I don't think that's the same as what you are implying.

So, no, Snape wasn't intentionally trying to get the Potters targeted, but he was certainly quick at trying to use it for his own ends (i.e. offing an old school rival).

******* Do you genuinely not see the difference here?

He was perfectly fine with them dying. But he did not /target/ them. Snape didn't tell Voldemort the prophecy so that he would go after the Potters - Snape didn't even know Harry was the subject of the prophecy.

Snape: Look! This prophecy speaks of some random person somewhere that will have the power to kill you!

Voldemort: Hmm. It's the Potter boy.

Snape: /Fuck/. Please don't kill the girl?

Snape had 0 chance of convincing Voldemort to leave Harry alone, and he would happily watch James die. Not the same thing as deliberately arranging their deaths.

This is the comment you were replying to.

Snape attempted to get Voldemort to agree to the trade of James and Harry for Lily. He tried to get /a terrorist/ (Voldemort) to /kill her husband and son/ (Harry and James), and leave her alone, /so he can have her for himself/.

So, no, Snape isn't a manipulative mastermind who used Voldemort as a weapon to off his romantic rival, he's simply someone willing to trade the lives of a man and his son so he could have the wife. Obviously, that's so much better.

I do agree with this statement and Snape is obviously not a good or moral person, but I still feel like asking Voldemort to not kill Lily and asking him to kill Harry and James are not the same thing. One is intentionally trying to get someone murdered while the other is asking a murderer to spare one family member while not caring about the other ones.

Both are bad of course, but I still don't feel like you can call the second one "Make a terrorist kill her husband and child so he can have her to himself". It's more of "Beg a terrorist to spare the mother when he goes on his killing spree of the Potter family".

So we agree. Snape did not proactively try and sic Voldemort on James & Harry so that he could have Lily. He accidentally put them all in danger, and tried to save the only one he cared about.

 

#+begin_quote

There's no trading happening. Snape isn't giving Voldemort anything in exchange for Lily - he already gave the prophecy. He's begging for a favor.

#+begin_quote
  He tried to get a terrorist (Voldemort) to kill her husband and son (Harry and James)
#+end_quote

Not true. He simply didn't try to save them. Which is understandable - /even if it's horrible/ - given that getting Voldemort to spare anyone at all was a fool's hope at best.

Saying that he /made/ Voldemort kill James and Harry is simply false.

#+begin_quote

Voldemort was ALREADY going to kill Harry and James. And Lily. All of them.

Snape didn't have the power to get him to spare Harry.

If he had asked for Voldemort to spare Harry- the kid prophesied to defeat Voldemort- how well do you really think that would've gone over? Voldemort would've looked at him... "So, Severus, you wish for me to be defeated? Avada Kedavra!" ... and that would have been the end of Snape.

So how could he "trade" anything? Voldie was killing Harry no matter what. All he could do was ask for non-essential people to be spared, like Lily and James.

That's not a trade, that's begging for mercy.

And what reason could he give Voldemort for begging for mercy for two of his enemies? Was he old school friends with James? Well, no, there's tons of Death Eaters who could testify that they were enemies in school. So that's suspicious as hell.

All he had an excuse to ask for was Lily.

** That would have hit him at a very young age.

Let's describe a plausible scenario:

Tobias Snape is abusive. Severus doesn't have accidental magic to protect him. Muggle teachers recognize signs of abuse (magicals seem blind to this) and pressure Eileen into leaving Tobias. She gets a job enchanting objects at a small shop at the edge of Knockturn Alley.

Severus focuses his anger at his father, even though he's absent. Changes his name to Severus Prince. He makes elaborate revenge fantasies. He's also angry at the wizarding world: how they treat his mother, the fact that they don't accept squibs like him.

He studies chemistry. And then he joins the IRA for a few years. It gives him an outlet for his anger. Gaining the necessary trust is difficult, but he's learned how to be a smooth talker when necessary.

He comes back in 1984. Tracks down Tobias Snape, kills him. Builds bombs, plants them in Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade. Amateur explosives is an unforgiving hobby, though, and one of his bombs goes off prematurely, killing him.

He takes out a quarter of Diagon Alley with him.

*** I read part of it but I have always felt like the author projected their love of linguistics and language onto Snape. I don't really see him getting into it, although that may be because I have always been more into science/math and not so much into the study of literature or language. None of his internal reasoning for being into the subject made sense to me. Seems like an odd topic for him to get into.

******* How did he not respect her choice? It's not like he followed her around after she got married or was in any way attempting to get back in her life after she started a family.

Begging a murderer to spare Lily's life and asking Dumbledore to save Lily was selfish of him, but I don't see how that relates to him not respecting her choice. It was a result of desperate attempts to save Lily, not because he had some master plan of getting her to himself.

Dumbledore tells him off for begging only for Lilys life. But what was he supposed to do? Be like "Voldemort, please spare the child that the prophecy says is going to destroy you". He would get killed just for suggesting such a thing and obviously he is not going to ask for James life to be spared either. Going to Dumbledore already ensures that the order will attempt to hide the entire family away and not just Lily.

At least he didnt see women as a somehow inferior form of humans. And he did not treat his female students worse than the boys.

He's permanently unable to get anywhere in any position of responsibility, as he got taken in by Combat 18 or some similar group when he was a teenager, and the string of public-order arrests had him narrowly avoid jail right when he should have been starting university. He claims, nowadays, that he was just in to Skrewdriver for the music, but the arrest notes that come up on his Enhanced Disclosure remark on the amount of cheap reproduction SS memorabilia his bedroom was decorated with...

He briefly stands as a local councillor for UKIP, until someone who remembers him from school tweets about his shady past.

Maybe a little too lowly for him, but if he was a squib, he wouldn't hold any power in this world.
