With two years of just the two of them, them being closest in age, having the next closest be Fred and George who naturally have their own bond, it seems natural that Ron and Ginny should have been very good friends, but you don't see that in canon, and you don't see it in much fic either.

Plz no Romione. I guess it's ok if it's a very minor background thing like it is in canon.

Also no Ron/Ginny incest. I was gonna say no incest but I guess if they bond over how weird it is that they caught Fred and George kissing I wanna read that fic

Edit: actually any bad Weasleys other than Ron or Ginny are ok. Them confronting PotionsMad!Molly about consent sounds great


** I don't know how to tag it, but Fate by thetrueSpartan has close Ron and Ginny, and it's not looking like he gets with Hermione (I'm currently reading it!). Some Molly bashing in the beginning, but they make up later.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.

** Linkffn(9260923) is very short, but very sweet.

Linkffn(12743240) is also short, also sweet, but also rather funny. And has an annoyingly appropriate title.
