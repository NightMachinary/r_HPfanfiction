My friend wants to try some fanfiction and do a book club with me. She wanted something longish but easy to read that talks about the 7th year at Hogwarts. I'm deciding between Not From Others and The Seventh Horcrux for it (haven't read either yet) and was looking for some advice.

1. Which is the better choice?
2. How many chapters to read a week/are there natural stopping places good for a book club
3. Is there a 7th year story that's a better start? I've read DAYD and while I liked it I dont she her liking it. She loves Neville though.
4. Any other suggestions for a successful book club?

Linkffn(Not from Others)

Linkffn(The Seventh Horcrux)


** Seventh Horcrux is not a newbie fic, as it pokes fun at a lot of common fanfic tropes. Not From Others is commonly recced for new fanficcers, but I haven't read it myself.

Linkffn(cauterize) is a post-war canon compliant highly recommended angst fic, but as it's a oneshot I'd save it to read a week in between longer fics.

Linkffn(3124159) is an awesome comedy fic from Minerva's POV that could have easily happened in canon. Lengthy chapters, so 1 chapter a week.

Linkffn(realizations by wishweaver) is an AU summer after 4th year when Harry gets a new OC family. No bashing of anyone (very unusual for this type of story!) and well written.

Linkffn(my nephew Harry by lucillia) What would have happened if Marge had taken in Dudley and Harry and discovered that Dudley was a bully and Harry was alright? Marge is very like canon, but believes in 'tough love' not meaningless child abuse. Good alternate POV of a minor character.

All of these are complete and suitable for new readers.

  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.

** I think you meant [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2818538/1/The-Seventh-Horcrux][The Seventh Horcrux by Melinlaleo]], linkffn(2818538), which was an alt-year 7 fic written before DH came out.

It's easily confused with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes]], linkffn(10677106), which came out in 2015 and was a parody.

I would definitely recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]] for your book club.

In addition, I would recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince]], linkffn(5677867), which is year 6 from Ginny's POV and nicely complements "Not From Others". Furthermore, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] is writing a gigantic postwar series consisting of 80+ short and novel length fics. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]], linkffn(6331126), is an excellent story talking about Harry and Ginny's work/life in 2009.

--------------

For AU (alternate universe) postwar fics, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), is my absolute favorite. In this one, Harry led an uprising against a still corrupt Ministry and pureblood oligarchy.

*** Yeah the bot mixed it up but I commented on it, foolish wishing that it would recognize "the" I guess.

Do you have any suggestions on how to split the book up? Should we just go chapter by chapter or do a few chapters at a time?

**** The seventh Horcrux was the first fic I ever read. I'd recommend it, purely because it was what made me start reading HP fanfiction in the first place.

I don't remember anything about plot or chapters, because this was like.... 7 years ago. I read nothing but Harry/Ginny for 2 years after that.

She also has a two part series with one of them being Curse of the Damned or something. I'd recommend those two as the next project.

Not from Others would be a bit more advanced reading I would say. I haven't read it yet, but I assume it would require more knowledge of the HP universe and characters to appreciate the story properly.

** It feels very weird and arrogant to rec my own fic for this, but I did write NFO to be as canon compliant as possible and the feedback I've had on it suggests it's a good introduction to fanfic, particularly if your friend feels uneasy about AU. I'll refrain from giving my opinion on DAYD but I like to think my fic fits the tone of the overall series a little more. I also recommend A Call to Arms by My Dear Professor Mcgonagall as an alternative - there's a little more Neville than I write, if I remember correctly, and it is very nicely written. The only downside is that I think Snape is written way too soppily and there's a weird "Ginny looks just like Lily!" thing. If you do decide to go with NFO I would say read it two or three chapters at a time at the start where things are a little slow then one at a time as things pick up when she gets to Hogwarts.

Another good fic you might enjoy as a fanfic starter is linkffn(Hogwarts Houses Divided) which follows Teddy Lupin. It introduces a lot of new characters but does a great job of capturing the warmth of the first few books.
