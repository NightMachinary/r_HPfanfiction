For those of you who ship Drastoria (Draco/Astoria) or any other pairing with Astoria Greengrass, which Hogwarts house do you see her in? and why? The wiki doesn't mention Hogwarts' house, just that she (like her sister) is a pureblood and that her sister (Daphne) was a Slytherin in Draco's year. There doesn't seem to be any consensus on the topic of Astoria's house. I've read several fics where she is in Slytherin, Ravenclaw (and even Gryffindor) respectively, but oddly enough no Hufflepuff (not that there isn't any). For some reason most fics I've found has her in Ravenclaw. What do you think? where does Astoria belong? There doesn't seem to be a lot of (canon) information regarding her out there.


** Honestly, because of her family I would say Slytherin. Daphne was a Slytherin and according to the information I know, she and Draco both changed their views on blood purity after what they saw during the war. This tells me she (most likely) held the same bigoted blood purity beliefs as other pureblood families, likely making her a Slytherin.

** Do with her what you want / need her to do. Canon gives no info, so it's your character to craft / form.

Figure out what Malfoy would look for in his wife, and start from there. My personal analysis:

- Malfoy always wanted to be accepted. He wouldn't want to piss of all his old buddies, so that basically eliminates Hufflepuff and Gryffindor.
- He'd also want a pureblood wife. He was raised for 17 years in the belief that blood is important, he wouldn't want to be the one to dirty the Malfoy line.
- Malfoy would want a smart wife. While I think he toys with the idea of a dumb trophy-wife he sees the advantage of a smart and powerful witch by his side. His mother saved his life twice by being smart (Forest, Unbreakable Vow). He also had enough of Crabbe and Goyle.
- Now that a big part of society hates him he'd probably like a non-Slytherin wife, simply to dispel rumors and kinda redeem himself.

I think these personally would see her in Ravenclaw for that reason. He has an in with her (Slytherin Daphne), she'd be smart, not too dark of a family, Ravenclaw, neither Slytherin nor Gryffindor, magcially powerful, pureblood.

All together in my head she's now Ravenclaw, or /possibly/ a Slytherin.

*** I like this reasoning, particularly in light of the idea that Astoria somehow tempered Draco's prejudice as mentioned in the [[http://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/draco-malfoy][Pottermore article on Draco]].

**** Yeah, while he doesn't really consciously believe in the idea of blood-purism anymore, I still don't think he'd want to dirty the line. He unconsciously will still be judging people based on blood for a long time - it takes time for a habit like this to go away, and that would make finding a non-pureblood wife hard. If you dislike something about someone, and can't even admit it to yourself, you wouldn't fall in love with them.

So he finds the next best thing - a non-traitor pureblood, who understands him, and shares his view.

***** Given that childbirth was quite risky for Astoria, and Draco told her he didn't care if the Malfoy line ended with him, I doubt he was too worried about creating half-blood Malfoys.

****** I don't consider CC canon, sorry. Epilogue, Pottermore, FB yes, CC no. It wasn't written by JKR, and I feel that every single line.

It simply introduces too many inconsistencies with OP time-travel.

******* Fair nuff. I don't either tbh, in that I don't consider the whole time-turner events to have happened. Especially considering Rowling's comments on the creation of Time-Turners and the problems they caused.

In fact, time travel gives me such a headache, I prefer to pretend that /so many/ devices for time travel didn't exist. Or that Hermione, a 14 year old, wasn't given one, unsupervised. I like stories where the turners can only do five, six, seven, or eight hours in a day, and thus, aren't really useful for anything but overambitious students and Unspeakables experimenting with paradoxes. Even eight is pushing it, tbh.

Given Pottermore's article on them, I'm amazed a play was written with people travelling so far back. Almost the entire cast it seems went back to see James and Lily alive!

******** Yeah, I see it exactly the same way. The worst is that CC uses so many ff-tropes, and does it so badly. I just glance over it, really.

Also, it doesn't really change anything I wrote, because what you say differs from what you think, and that again differs from what you act unconsciously, see racism and sexism. A lot of people aren't consciously racist / sexist, but still act that way. I'd believe Draco would still kinda act that way - especially in choosing a partner for life. Maybe he can 'police himself' for most of the time, but I doubt he can influence who he falls in love with. And I doubt his sub-conscious would allow him to date a muggleborn.

******** Yes, that's why I said "I don't consider CC canon" not "CC isn't canon" - I actually only read half of it, before I gave up. I simply can't accept so much of it, sorry.

** How can I picture her as anything? She's just a name and isn't even in the books... I guess I give her slightly higher odds for Slytherin because of her sister and Death Eater husband.

** I always pictured her as a Slytherin or a Ravenclaw.

As changed and more mature as he is, Draco would /never/ had married a Gryffindor. And Hufflepuffs are even more useless (in his eyes I mean).

*** A Gryffindor would never have married Draco. He was an arse all through his school years, finding a girl who'd overlook that, in Gryffindor, his main target, would be difficult. The same reasoning applies to Hufflepuffs, or maybe even more so, because they'd be loyal to the bullying targets, like Justin.

** I see it as two camps. If it's ever canonically revealed, the choice would probably be Slytherin because that's the obvious choice for someone who marries Draco, or something else, because JKR would do that just to shake conventional wisdom with perhaps some fan pandering and whitewashing thrown in on the side.

Personally, I do find her being in Ravenclaw slightly more interesting. The idea of someone possibly still following older ideals (blah blah pureblood tradition, etc) but not being in Slytherin can maybe lead to an interesting plot (usually doesn't). Alternatively, perhaps she sees her sister in Slytherin, and decides that's not who she wants to grow up to be, she sees the isolation and bigotry or whatever fanon people throw in.

I think I wrote her as a popular Ravenclaw in my most recent story but I can't honestly remember.

** I like her as a character that stands in crass contrast to the fanon-character of the pureblood princess Daphne. As such I do think that Hufflepuff would be a nice House for her.

But then again, she is 100% OC. She can be whatever you need her to be in your story.
