** So I'm not sure what you mean by archetype of a tragic hero, I'm a math major so forgive my ignorance. Could you explain what that is in layman's terms? Google wasn't exactly clear.

*** A tragic hero is a character that faces adversity and danger with courage. However, this can usually lead to their own downfall. A tragic hero usually exhibits the following characteristics:

"Hamartia -- a tragic flaw that causes the downfall of a hero. Hubris -- excessive pride and disrespect for the natural order of things. Peripeteia -- The reversal of fate that the hero experiences. Anagnorisis -- a moment in time when hero makes an important discovery in the story. Nemesis -- a punishment that the protagonist cannot avoid, usually occurring as a result of his hubris. Catharsis -- feelings of pity and fear felt by the audience, for the inevitable downfall of the protagonist."

Examples include Oedipus from Sophocles' Oedipus Rex and Hamlet.

As someone with an advanced degree in Classical Civilizations that sat through way too many lectures on Greek Tragedy and has actually written about half of a novel retelling the Oresteia from the point of view of Pylades, that's a very poor definition that fits closer to an Epic Hero (IE Hector or Achilles) than a Tragic Hero. Your explanation reads more like a poorly edited copy of a wikipedia entry.

A Tragic Hero needs to have a sense of doom about it. It's an archetype that relies heavily on dramatic irony. As the reader/viewer will have to understand the end game for it to truly work. There is a sense that the hero makes the correct decision, morally, but then in actuality it proves to be the absolute wrong decision. After said decision is made, there is some sort of reversal that proves how the original judgement by the character was incorrect. And the character then goes on to understand how he/she was wrong but has by then is past the point of no return, as it were. And the consequences involved then are typically debilitating either mentally or physically to the character. In short, there has to be a 'there was really no other way this could go'.

Hubris as a required flaw was more used because the Greek playwrights were commentating on something, and hubris was big in Greece. Giving the legendary characters that fault is a way to say something about their society and morals.

A Tragic Hero is more about the inevitability of the action when it's the only realistic action that character had. In Harry Potter the closest character that probably comes to the archetype is Snape, but I would argue he doesn't really fit because I don't feel his actions lead directly to his death in that inevitable of a way. Nor does he ever really have the 'moment' required where things spin on his head and shift his world view before it's too late.

That's not to say there not a tragedy to Snape. It's just he doesn't fit that neatly into the archetype. Someone could argue that he sort of does with Lily, but to fit the archetype he'd have needed to be in the right more than he was by that point.

A Tragic Hero, more modernly to fit into the ancient Archetype, needs to be the one that the audience is rooting for, morally. And has to make a decision that is understandable and arguably as morally right as the character, and then essentially have it all backfire on him or her. They must then see the error in their ways, but it's too late to avoid the consequences of their action. It needs to be more of a case of 'did everything right, still lost' than anything else.

This often works better on stage for drawing the empathy of the viewer than it does directly in text.

***** That was a great explanation. I agree that Snape lacks the "trying to do the right thing but failing" dramatic irony

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7309863]]) It doesn't seems like it at the beginning but is probably the most tragic I can think of, all the better because the tragedy is not just shoved in your face with an EMO atmosphere since the beginning

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
