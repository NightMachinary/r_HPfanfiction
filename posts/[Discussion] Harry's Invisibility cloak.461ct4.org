Okay, we know in canon that harry receives his invisibility cloak from Dumbledore at christmas and he decides to use it. Yet Dumbledore knows he's there and even fake moody in GoF. But what I don't get is that its the supposed cloak from the Hallows, and its said the 3rd brother was able to hide from death. So how is it that death couldn't find someone using something of his own creation until willingly given up, but Dumbledore and moody were able to. I'm 90% sure there was something about charms being able to see through it, but surely death would have been able to do that.


** What you're forgetting is that the Tale of Three brothers is a fairy tale for children. It has some elements of truth in it, but much of it is exaggerated/mystified, just like most other fairy tales. For example, it obviously wasn't "Death" who gave the Hallows to the brothers; rather, it was that the Peverells were gifted wizards who created powerful artifacts, which then were passed down as legends.

This is proven by the fact that the elder wand does not guarantee victory for its owner (as the legend says), as evidenced by Dumbledore's victory over Grindelwald when the latter was in possession of the Death Stick. Similarly, while the cloak is special in that the invisibility does not fade, its power of escaping "Death" is obviously just an exaggeration.

*** I guess, but how would the resurrection stone work? Thats necromancy shit right there. It could work like the mirror of erised showing those who you truly miss rather than your desires. But it still seems weird to me.

**** Well, necromancy does exist in the HP world (e.g. Inferi), although no form of completely successful necromancy is known. Cadmus Peverell, who no doubt was a very talented wizard, may have studied necromancy deeply after the loss of his loved one (although that may have been a myth). And what he made (the Resurrection Stone) was an extremely powerful, groundbreaking discovery, like the other two Hollows. However, it too had limitations of necromancy, with the "shades" not having a full form and "suffering greatly" after prolonged existence in the living world.

As for whether the shades were actually their souls or not, I have no clue. Canon doesn't say, so it's up to your interpretation.

**** The Priori Incantatem effect on Tom's wand managed to recreate, or pull back from behind the veil, souls of the people it killed or at least convincing enough facsimiles of them. This would tell us that a part of a person killed by the killing curse lives with them, and yet this doesn't make sense and drawing a spirit back is much more likely.

The Resurrection Stone might be doing just that, only it is more aimed than the effect on wands because it's a tool made specifically for this purpose.

*** I'm of the opinion that so many fairy tales have true roots (particularly in the wizarding world), that the peverell story needs to be more accurate than "the 3 brothers had these items".

Now, this could go many ways. They may have hidden themselves while designing them, and decided the item's power was too strong and more shouldn't be made, so they made up a story where they were given them by "death"

It could be they were able to make a deal with death itself while journeying. Or perhaps it was a demon of some sort, that they had never seen or heard of before and so they dubbed it death, due to its fearsome visage.

Regardless, i don't think it is /obvious/ that it just a story and the peverell brothers made the items. Its hidden in the mists of time, and without being given more information we cant separate fact from fiction

*** I just thought of a few more things, if it was Death (or some being like that) which gave them the hallows.

"But Death was cunning. He pretended to congratulate the three brothers..." (TTotTB). I see Death here as acting truly cunning, like a djinn. Granting gifts (wishes) in such a way that satisfies the request, but not the intent /of/ the request.

1) Elder Wand: "...a wand more powerful than any in existence...that must always win /duels/ for its /owner/...worthy of a wizard /who had conquered Death/!" (TTotTB).

There are so many possible loopholes in this request. "Must always win /duels/", so if Dumbledore didn't formally challenge Grindelwald to a duel, or if their fight was during a battle of many wizards, it still holds true. "For its /owner/", perhaps the only true owner was the eldest peverell brother, so once he was murdered and the wand stolen, no other wizard was ever the owner, and while it was still a powerful wand it didn't guarantee wins for anyone anymore. "Worthy of a wizard /who had conquered Death/", surviving a river crossing that most die doing probably isn't conquering Death (though it might be defying Death), so perhaps the only one who would be guaranteed wins, the true "owner" of the wand, would be one who was immortal (like flamel and the stone, or voldemort with his horcruxes), or the one who had united all the hallows (harry, eventually).

2) The Resurrection Stone: "...asked for the power to /recall others from Death/." (TTotTB)

We already know the trickery of Death in this case, he gave the power to recall the dead in spirit form for a limited time, not true resurrection like the second brother intended. A clear case of Death cunningly avoiding the intent of the request.

3) Cloak of Invisibility: "The youngest brother...did not trust Death. So he asked for something that would enable him to go forth from /that place/ without being /followed/ by Death." (TTotTB)

Here is where its a bit more muddled. Later we see the line, "But though Death searched for the third brother for many years, he was never able to find him." (TTotTB) To paraphrase the end, when the third brother took off the cloak he greeted Death as an old friend and departed this life.

Obviously while the cloak allowed the brother to leave without being followed, it also prevented death from finding him later. There are 2 options i see. First, Death was cunning and the cloak lost its power over Death after the third brother left /that place/, but since the third brother was "the humblest and also the wisest of the brothers" (TTotTB), he took other precautions to ensure Death didn't find him later like his brothers. To add to his ruse, the brother made a show of taking off his cloak when he was ready to die, in order to add to the mystery of his heirloom cloak. Second, Death was unable to work around the restrictions of the request to his advantage, due to Death's powers. There was no item other than Death's own cloak that would enable someone to leave a place "without being /followed/ by Death." So "Death, most /unwillingly/, handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility." (TTotTB)

** IMO, the idea of deathly hallows didn't come up until the sixth or even the seventh book. When the cloak was first introduced, it wasn't meant to be such a powerful magical artifact but a rather amusing and rare device and so it was depicted to have some weaknesses. But recall how, in the seventh book, the cloak's power was emphasized when Harry and co. apparated at Hogsmead and a Death Eater tried to summon it only for the cloak to refuse to budge.

As far as I am concerned, it is a (very) minor plot hole in Rowling's story and as a fanfic writer (who is heavily into the MoD!Harry genre), I tend to ignore it. Why one of my stories is even centered on the invisibility cloak itself.

** Just my headfanon here, but I think of the Cloak as protecting the wearer from an untimely death. Harry wasn't in any immediate danger when the fake Moody spotted him, so the magical eye worked as normal. Likewise, Dumbledore would never mean Harry any harm, so he could both see through its illusion and Freeze Harry in the Astronomy Tower.

** The request was specifically for something that could hide from death, was it not? It's kinda like the old argument could God make a stone so heavy that he himself couldn't lift it?

Maybe Death is just polite enough not to kill anyone under that cloak.

  The third brother was wiser, and hid under the Invisibility Cloak that allowed him to postpone death until he was ready; he lifted the veil that had helped him to evade the afterlife and was welcomed by Death

Googled the story and thats what popped up for the third brother

** They probably couldnt see him, but Harry probably made noise and someone observant enough could pick up on it. The eye might just have seen ripples of sound. If Harry had used a silencing spell then it would be more conspicuos. Basically Harry wasnt adept enough at using the cloak by that point. If the cloak is sentient, then maybe it needs proper intent to work fully like a wand.

** I'm not sure what to do about moody, but it never bothered me that Dumbledore could see through the cloak. He had it in his possession for 11 quiet years, and he was obsessed with the hallows in his youth. I have no doubt that he would have spent the time to study it and determine how it hides the wearer and determine if there is any way to circumvent its invisibility. As dumbledore is brilliant, obsessed, and with a plethora of time, he succeded

Perhaps at some point dumbledore enlisted real moody's help to see what his fake eye made of the cloak, and being the paranoid guy he is, moody tagged the cloak with a subtle charm keyed to his eye so he would never be snuck up on by someone wearing it.

I prefer the idea of Moody's eye being a loophole. The cloak acts like a protective coat so anyone looking at it can't see the person behind it, but we know Moody's eye can see through things, so it bypasses the cloak's protection. So Moody's eye isn't stronger, it just hits straight onto the cloak's weakness.

I don't think a tracking charm (are those even mentioned in canon?) would work, since the cloak is immune to detection magic iirc. There's one scene I remember where someone tries to summon the cloak off Harry, and it's immune to it, and then when Harry talks about the Hallows later he mentions that his cloak doesn't just make him invisible, it /hides/ him, and although I can't remember the exact phrasing he definitely talks about how it can't be affected by locating magic.

** Dumbledore is NOT Death. Protection from Death does not automatically include protection from man.

That said, Harry was an eleven-year old fairly unobservant child and invisibility does not include soundlessness, untouchability, masking of body odour or even transparency to air flow.

** I know it has been a few days since this discussion started, but here is my take on it.

When the first book in the series was published, nobody knew or suspected that Harry Potter had a horcrux in his scar. Of course, in hindsight it was heavily foreshadowed in the hospital scene with Dumbledore, but at that point in time nobody could know which direction Rowling would go with it. The same is true for the cloak. During Harry's first year he only knew that the invisibility cloak was a gift that was originally his father's. I don't remember all that happened with the cloak throughout the book series, but (and this is important) it was said that invisibility cloaks faded with age. Yet, although people close to Harry knew about this being a Potter family heirloom, did anybody ever question the apparent longevity of the cloak over the years? No.

We can assume that invisibility cloaks are likely rather expensive, but their existence must be widely known, or someone like Ron would probably not have known about them. This shouldn't be taken as a dig at the second youngest Weasley, but he clearly was not enthusiastic about learning and Rowling has never shown us that wizards received any kind of established pre-Hogwarts education. Whatever he learned about the wizarding world must have come from his own experience of growing up in a magical family and from whatever second-hand sources that were available to him (the Wizarding Wireless radio, the Daily Prophet, etc). Taking this extrapolation and continuing with what I already wrote earlier (no wizard ever caught on to Harry's cloak being extra special), we can assume that wizards know about the existence of invisibility cloaks like us non-magicals know about, say, helicopters or aeroplanes. Just like we couldn't tell much about the inner workings of such a flying machine (how many people know how many maintenance hours are required for every flying hour for example?), neither did school children, professors or other adults who found out about Harry's cloak ever come to suspect it for being special.

It comes down to this: do you want to believe in continuity or not? Did Rowling already know about the unexplored and unexplained concepts she used in her first book, or did she merely write a children's story with lots of either shallow or accidental insinuations, some of which she then chose to take up in the sequels? It wouldn't change anything about the topic, but in my opinion, Harry had the legendary Cloak of Invisibility from the very beginning in the first book. For what other reason could Dumbledore have wanted to borrow that specific cloak, after all?

Now on to the second question. Harry's cloak is truly the Cloak of Invisibility of legend, but was it handed to the youngest Peverell brother by Death himself, or is it merely an ancient magical artefact?

Over the years and throughout Harry Potter's time at Hogwarts, we have come to learn about a great many magical things that survived until the present, but little concrete information about the age or source of magical objects is actually available in the books. The Sorting Hat is without a doubt the one truly magical object that can be safely attributed to an ancient wizard like Godric Gryffindor, but more remotely, other objects like the moving and talking paintings all over the castle must have endured the test of time as well. While this does not answer the question in any way, it is a good set-up for the opinion I want to express. Even in the first book it is made clear, that impressive magical objects have been created many hundreds if not a thousand years in the past or more. Some of them have been deemed so useful (or indestructible) that they survived until Harry started his first year at Hogwarts.

This is a clear indication that magic was not (entirely) primitive in the past, just like our own forefathers were smarter than many people of today realize. It has taken us hundreds of years to arrive at well thought-out explanations for some of the biggest feats done in ancient times, like the creation of the pyramids for example. Even today many yet disbelieve the power of human ingenuity and organisation that were required.

The Statute of Secrecy was only introduced in 1692, before that you have centuries of time where magicals lived and interacted openly with muggles and, if history is to be believed, not often peacefully. Who is to say, that there was not some well known, feared and a bit deranged wizard living alone in some remote part of the country, who came to be called by the title of "Death" by the non-magicals living in the area? Don't forget, that the story of the three brothers is set in a time, when non-magicals were not only a very superstitious lot but also conditioned to believe in God(s) and Faith through a strong community. Just like people in the Middle Ages saw the devil in everything they could not explain, centuries earlier there existed a true, if baser, spirituality in the common man.

Some wizard in ancient times has probably created a number of magical objects and for some reason that we're not privy to, he gave them to three brothers crossing his lands. Or maybe the brothers even stole the desirable objects from him and made the story up. That would not be a huge surprise, since the tale clearly doesn't paint the brothers in their best light. Whatever may have been the truth, how the story got out would be easy to explain, after the oldest brother started bragging about an unbeatable wand. There are many ways this could've gone down of course, but that is the likeliest explanation in my opinion. Mostly though I like this theory, because it allows for the cloak to be extraordinary without being perfect. It's not a foolproof method to become entirely undetectable after all, just perfectly invisible.
