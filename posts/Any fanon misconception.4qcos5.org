** The wiki is full of unsubstantiated claims and information and doesn't cite most of the stuff. I'd stick the the HP Lexicon for quick look ups, but really, it's the books that count.

** Luna states that other people take her things ("People take them and hide them...") which has led to fanfic exaggerations such as Luna being locked out of the dorms naked.

On the other hand, this is Luna. Maybe she just kicks off her shoes in random places and forgets what she did with them.

** They're not really fanon misconceptions, just points from canon that are very easily twisted for more plot points to write about. Seer Luna and Pervert Sirius were never a Thing in the books. Although I haven't read up on Pottermore, so you could try cross referencing there.

** I get annoyed that Malfoy is so often described as Harry's rival and better at magic than most of the class when he's clearly an incompetent pest.

** The Sirius thing, like you said. Everyone portrais him as a womanizer (unless he's dating Remus), and that always slightly bugged me because there's nothing that tells us that, and yet it seems to be everyone's idea of him.

I think wards are a thing, just not to the extensive detail and boring description some people like to use them as. The lord thing is equally exagerated, but that doesn't usually bother me.

Luna actually grew up to become a magizoologist and prove the existence of many of her animals. I mean, that doesn't invalidate your personality disorder theory, but it does go to show that her father was, in fact, right.

For things that bother me, personally, I need ot be that little bitch again and mention Charlus and Dorea, a concept I never liked even before it became canon that it was false.

** On the sirius note, I think it's worth remembering that he had posters of bikini clad girls in his room. While it's made clear that it's partly teenage rebellion against his parents, it does suggest that he is very much into women and possibly not too concerned with chaste, monogamous relationships. If I recall correctly, in the OotP memory he was also looking over at the girls by the lake (or was that James? I thought he was busy playing with the snitch). The fact that he ignored one particular girl in an exam may be that she's an ex, that he didn't like her, that he didn't even notice and so on. I agree that sometimes manslut!Sirius goes way too far though.

Well, since he left Grimmauld Place at 16, that's probably true.

**** Eh, that doesn't really ring true for me. I know some people don't consider it canon, but Lupin's story on Pottermore mentions that Lupin bitterly said to Tonks "he [Sirius] always got the girls." Personally I read the fact that he wasn't paying attention to the girl in OotP as a sign that he was so used to girls being all over him that he could pick and choose.

That is overzealous. I had stolen porn magazines, posters of scantily clad (celebrity) women, and a number of porn flicks as a teen and was both very much into women and chaste/monogamous. I still am both

  Lordships... it seems that only the Black family practiced that 'Lord somethin somethin'.

And I'm fairly willing to bet that, if the world was more fleshed out, you'd see more of this. I imagine this "lord" refers to the lord of the manor, which doesn't refer specifically to a building but to land. It's an older form of property rights, essentially. The lord of a manor owns land, and under him are tenants or serfs, who are /kind of/ like renters today. Tenants had obligations they had to fulfill to the lord, be it labor, goods, or money (or some combination thereof), under penalty of law. Ultimately, the land and all means of production on the land belonged to the lord of the manor.

I'm /way/ oversimplifying here, but that's the gist of it. Manorialism was around for a very long time and went through some major changes to stay relevant in society, so it'd only make sense for the magical world to take advantage of it, especially when they weren't in full hiding.

Whether or not it's still /relevant/ in the modern magical world is another story, but when you see a fic talk about lords or vassals or whatever, it's probably not as crazy as you think. Lordship (of a manor) was a real thing which existed for a very long time. In a society still as backwards as Magical Britain's, why wouldn't it take them even longer than muggles to lose feudalism?
