I'm looking for fic recommendations. Specifically fics that are so well written, that despite them having a pairing you don't normally like, or using a trope you normally can't stand, you really enjoyed. Maybe they didn't change your mind about the pairing/trope but which are a noted exception to your general dislike. Preferably longer and multi chapter, and also preferably completed or regularly updated.


** linkffn(What's Her Name in Hufflepuff by ashez2ashes) It's a first person POV self insert fic which I normally wouldn't ever check out but I just love it. It's funny, the main character has some amazing sarcastic commentary on everything and it has great worldbuilding. The plot is often original and there is no canon rehash scenes. The OC is a believable likable person who doesn't instantly become best friends with main characters or solve all problems with her super powerful abilitities. She to her frustration keeps running into problems as her plans don't work out they way she thinks they will. A fun read and currently ongoing.

linkffn(Blurring Reality by Terrific Lunacy) A fic with a summary that makes it sound like a bad modern AU but is actually amazing and something way more than that. I originally clicked on it because of how ridiculous it sounded but got really into it. The writing is awesome and it manages to turn into a normal setting into some sort of supernatural thriller with humour and meta commentary on the Harry Potter series as a whole.

The setting is that Hogwarts is a dance school that is putting on a performance called the prophecy. As time goes on, the characters start losing their sense of reality and what is real and what is not as they blend with the characters they are playing. Has some of the most intense action scenes I have read which is strange since most of them are told through dance scenes and performances. It is incomplete though.

*** Thanks for the description of "Blurring Reality". I've seen it recommended several times, but I always thought it sounded like a crack fic, which generally isn't my cup of tea. However, what you've described sounds more like some interesting psychological horror (a little bit like /Black Swan/?) so I'll have to give it a try.

  Tom Riddle, top student of the prestigious Hogwarts School for Dance. Albus Dumbledore, searching for the hero in his famous end of year performance by holding open auditions. Harry Potter, attending said auditions only to listen to the live music for free. Severus Snape, dance instructor, tolerating nothing but perfection.

*** I think one of the things I enjoyed most about this fic was that Bellatrix at the end was still a vicious, vindictive, and borderline psychotic witch - she was just vicious, vindictive, borderline psychotic /devoted to Harry/ rather than Voldemort. There was no 'instant cure' for her personality; she simply had someone different, better, to devote herself to. I very much enjoyed her characterization.

**** Hey, you sound as if you read Delenda Est to its end. I read it all the while back while it was a WIP and have not read it again since it has been finished. Now I keep reading people saying how it is a fic with two very different halves. And that they hated the second half. Could you explain it to me? Because I am very sure all I read was part of the "first half". Did it just become bad? Or were there unrealistic plot twists? Just wondering if its worth it to pick it up again.

I really enjoyed it, but I also didn't walk in expecting one thing and getting it taken away from me.

  Looking after a Muggle animal should be easy compared to saving Hogwarts from Voldemort. Harry and Draco might disagree with that. Featuring Luna, Marauders, peppermints and, of course, a tall, black, badtempered horse named Simon.

  I'm a little upset with the creativity of my and my twin's names. I get that it's because our father's name is Arthur, and I was an unexpected --- though pleasant --- surprise. But Guinevere is just the English version of Ginevra! That's so- Wait. What do I even care about that?I'm the eighth Weasley. In the Harry Potter universe.

  Just another Pureblood!Hermione story. A hidden adoption revealed, a brother found, a new world to figure out: "What are you hoping for?" he asked as they stood ready to do the spell. "I don't know," Hermione admitted. "You?" His knuckles were white on his wand. "A sister," he said, his voice very low, "I'm hoping for a sister." Winner 2015 Energize WIP Awards. COMPLETE.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  Scorpius isn't on the Hogwarts Express at the start of seventh year, and Albus discovers that he's become very ill over the summer. Determined to find out what's wrong with him and how to make him better, Albus starts doing some research, and discovers Moramortia, a fatal illness with just one cure. Together, Albus and Scorpius (with some help from Rose) set out on an adventure to find the ingredients to make the potion that will hopefully save Scorpius's life...

Scorpius receives a prefect badge and Albus is going to join the Quidditch team, if Scorpius can just convince him that he should try out. It's going to be the year everything works out for them, and if that means Scorpius keeping his huge crush on his best friend a secret, then that's just what he's going to have to do.It's just a crush. He can get over it well before fifth year is over, can't he?
