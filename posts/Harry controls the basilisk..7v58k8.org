I'm trying to find a fic I've read before. I believe it's a time travel story but it could be an AU. Harry meets the basilisk before the events of the second year and basilisk explains that Slytherin never meant for it to attack muggleborns Tom was behind that and the snake decides Harry is a better heir of Slytherin. That's all I can remember. Any help finding it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

  A basic rule of time, it will fight change. Harry, Hermione and Luna return to stop Voldemort thanks to the last of the fae. But they are not alone and time will not bend to their will easily. They will fight, they will prank and they will be followed through time. Dumbledore, Ron and Molly bashing. Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith"
