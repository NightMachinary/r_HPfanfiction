I was wondering if there was a fic where Ginny was infatuated with Harry because of hero worship because he saves her life, and Harry was attracted to Ginny because she resembled his mother/it was a way to cope with never knowing his mother. Because I feel that would be a really messed-up and dark fic. I'm not necessarily interested in that type of fic, I just wanted to know if something like that was out there.


** How does Ginny resemble his mother? The red hair? Totally different colours, Lily's is a dark auburn while Ginnys is a crimson ginger golds and coppers.

*** Everyone knows that if you marry a girl with hair color similar to your parents, it's because you have an incest fetish though.

** Ah, yes. The wonderful "Ginny is a redhead, so Harry must have an incest fetish" trope. Makes /so much sense./

*** No. What Rowling was thinking, was "Oh shit, Harry needs a love interest"
