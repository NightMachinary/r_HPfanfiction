Basically the Doctor Who episode "The Eleventh Hour", except the Tardis crashes into Privet Drive. Harry's home alone, or have the Dursley's involved, that could be fun, when it all goes down. Point is the Doctor offers Harry to come with him (as he did to Amelia Pond), see the sights across time and space. An offer to which Harry agrees. And that's the last time anyone sees Harry Potter for many years...

While I'd be interested in what happens /during/ their trips, as I imagine the Doctor could get Harry some magical training (Merlin himself perhaps), let's talk about when he comes back to Earth.

Assuming, for the sake of convenience, that the timeline roughly realigns with its canon counterpart eleven year old Harry reappears on Earth in time to go to the same first year of Hogwarts that he goes to in canon. This is a Harry who's had, at least in my prompt, about three years of travelling space and time. What changes does that cause?

This probably changes his reaction to Time Turners. Instead of "Wow, time travel" it might be closer to "What the hell did you just do?!" I'm imagining Harry, who knows exactly how dangerous time travel is, hyperventilating.

Tardis Translation Circuits means he may not notice he's a Parselmouth, as perhaps he's met and talked to snakes before and just assumes that they're some species that just happens to /look/ like snakes.

Tom Riddle's Diary could, potentially, be taken care of in an interesting way. Harry notices that Ginny is acting weird, figures out that she's possessed (or quickly getting to that state) and calls in the Doctor, as Harry trusts the Doctor to deal with this sort of thing. Maybe because the Doctor helped deal with Harry's Horcrux while they were out and about.

Harry probably wouldn't be that worried about being expelled. If he is he'll just go to Hogwarts at a different time, maybe be part of the first generation and meet the Founders. Or he'll just go back to the Tardis, go back to his travels.

Plus I think the reaction Harry Potter just vanishing one day would be kinda interesting. The Dursley's are suddenly under a lot of scrutiny, magical and muggle, as everyone wants to know what happened to the child left in their care. Dumbledore is freaking out, because the kid who's supposed to defeat Voldemort is just /gone/.

Be funny if Harry, for whatever reason, doesn't say where he's been, "Travelling" he tells them, and while everyone wants to know, no one can justify /making/ him tell them (he's a child, last of the Potter Family, Boy Who Lived, etc, etc).

**** Why do people still measure lengh based on number of chapters (rather than word count)? The Author can make the chapter as long or as short as he wants.

***** Can't speak for others, but for me it's because I've built up the bad habit of not looking at the word count. I just assume "Lots of chapters = lots of story". I shouldn't, and I'm trying to learn not to, but that's what I do.

** Alternatively, it goes like canon and the Doctor wants to take 8 year old Harry with him but accidentally skips a few years and doesn't make it back for a decade and gets stuck with post-DH Harry.

*** Possible, could lead to some interesting moments. I was just more interested in what a Harry that's been on the Tardis for three years would be like at Hogwarts, mainly his reactions to certain parts of canon.
