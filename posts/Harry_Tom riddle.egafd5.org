All I remember is that its on wattpad and harry somehow ends up living with him and being pregnant. To destroy the light side they send Harry's life story to the daily prophet pretending to be someone close to harry. And theres this part where they're shopping for baby stuff and they want to engrave something on the crib butt he shop guy says no so they threaten him with dark lord scariness and he agrees then they go to a different shop and the shop lady says the same thing happened to her so they told her to tell him they sent her and she got very happy


** I'd recommend asking over at [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]] I'm actually pretty surprised you haven't been downvoted xD Normally Mpreg Harrymort stories get destroyed pretty hard...
