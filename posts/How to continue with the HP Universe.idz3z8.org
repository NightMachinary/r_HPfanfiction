Hello everyone this is my first time posting. I wanted to ask you what else can i read? I read for the first time the 7 books and now im in the second one of the James Junior Series that has 5 books. After this what to you recommend. I would really like something to do with the original trio after Hogwarts.

Thanks in advance


** If you don't have any specific preferences for shipping, I recommend reading canon compliant fics that either fill those missing moments or continue after DH. Some good examples:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince]], linkffn(5677867), is a nice year 6 fic from Ginny's POV. Very well written.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]], linkffn(11419408), is a great year 7 fic from Ginny's POV. Can be dark at times.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13072492/1/Democracy][Democracy]], linkffn(13072492), is an interesting case. It's not completely canon compliant, but is a really good political fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]], linkffn(6331126), is IMO the best canon compliant postwar fic. It features Harry and Ginny's work/life in 2009, narrated from their Muggle neighbor's POV. It's part of a 85+ postwar story series.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12925628/1/Interview-with-Director-Potter][Interview with Director Potter]], linkffn(12925628), is my own one shot set 20 years after the Battle. Harry explains many things here.

  The story of "Harry Potter and the HBP", but told from the 3rd person POV of Ginny Weasley. Strictly in-canon. Suitable for anyone whom the "Harry Potter" novels themselves would be suitable for.

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.

** Personally speaking, I like AU (alternate universe) fics way better than canon compliant ones. If you stay around here long enough, you will soon encounter many threads that criticize or deconstruct the canon plot and world. At least I see lots of problems with canon. Also, as you read more and more fanfics, you may soon ask those "what if" questions, and that's a good time to dive into AU fics.

Here are some of my favorites:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106): the most popular fic on this sub by a wide margin. This â€˜Harry' thinks he's Voldemort, acts like Voldemort, has the power of Voldemort, but he only wants to teach DADA forever.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): Harry and his friends finally had it enough and declared war on the incorrigible Ministry and Wizengamot. They begin with vigilante killings of Death Eaters who got off again.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): This Harry never entered Wizarding Britain, and was raised by his own parents who got Voldemort with a nasty trap that night. But that doesn't mean he's a nice guy though. Dark war epic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): Harry time travels to 1975 and has to team up with Bellatrix. This Harry is war hardened veteran, and Bellatrix, despite following Harry, is by no means a paragon of virtue. But it's fun watching her in action.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994): Another dark war epic. This Hermione forms her own guerrilla group after Year 5 and becomes a very effective killer of rank and file Death Eaters. But Harry and Ron are not slacking off either, as they will come into their roles later in the story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/Petrification-Proliferation][Petrification Proliferation]], linkffn(11265467): Dumbledore takes the aftermath of CoS event more seriously. It's very refreshing to see how the canon plot disintegrates if the adult good guys are only slightly more competent and less negligent.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] happens in a sci-fi universe with superpowers. It's a long completed story with 600+k words, goes through all 7 years, and mirrors canon events loosely. The last year is significantly different though.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925): December 1999, badly traumatized Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Neville are thrown into a new world where things are very different. One of the most emotional HP fanfic I've ever read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13133746/1/Daphne-Greengrass-and-the-Importance-of-Intent][Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent]], linkffn(13133746): One of the best Harry/Daphne fics, no bashing, no power fantasies, great characterizations, and a very adorable Astoria.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/Petunia-Evans-Tomb-Raider][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]], linkffn(13052802): Petunia is a squib and a BAMF archeologist. She, Sirius, Bill, and Fleur did the heavy lifting against Voldemort in this fic.
