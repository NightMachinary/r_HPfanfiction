Harry Potter crossover with Sword Art Online More Than 60k words preferred I have read Mystic Knight Online and Magic Online. Thanks for any help.


** Did you enjoy linkffn(Magic Online)? I don't know how to feel about it, the Harry here is very childish as in most of the stories of the same author, but otherwise not bad. There's a bit of overexposure and long explorations in dialogue (not as much as in Twice Blessed Shinobi). What do you think?

*** Harry is very childish in this one. Thats why I switched to linkffn(11815818) This story has a more mature view on the situation and it is weekly updated.

  The magical world isn't as ignorant of muggles as it seems, and Lucius Malfoy has an idea on how to get Harry out of his way. Now Harry is in Japan and trapped in a virtual world of swords. Cut off from his friends and allies, and what he knew, he has to make new ones and get used to an illusory world that has become all too real. Welcome, to SAO Harry. Do try to survive.

  It has always been said that magic and technology did not mix; too bad no one ever mentioned that little fact to young Harry Potter. Add in one mad genius bent on destroying the lives of ten thousand people by trapping them inside of his online virtual reality game and you have the makings of a very dangerous brew. HP/HG
