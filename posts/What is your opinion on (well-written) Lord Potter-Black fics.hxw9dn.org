** The Lord! Harry trope is one of the ones I dislike the most. I don't think it add anything good to a story and most of the time, I either enjoy a fic /despite/ this trope, or it's a deal breaker which make me drop it.

First of all, I don't think a lordship system would fit at all the canon Universe. Mainly because it would defeat the point of the existence of the Death Eater. In an Aristocratic society, they would be the noble class and already in power, so why would they follow a terrorist into a tentative to take the power by force?\\
I also want to point that, from what we saw in canon, Blood may confer an advantage in some groups, but will be always inferior to Abilities when it came to respect. Nobody care about Dumbledore and Voldemort blood status because they both could take half the ministry in a duel and win. Even the worst Blood Purist seem happy to forget Snape Blood Status because he was good. Despite his claim of following "the old ways", Lucius was only respected because of his talent, and lost of this respect when he failed at his task. His son, Draco, was never respected outside of the schoolyard, because he never showed any ability.\\
The only mention of "nobility" in canon are "Lord" Voldemort, who took this title to show how he was superior to the masses (and probably to mock his followers), and the "Most Ancient and Noble House of Black" who just used it as a vanity title. You could add the same thing before your family name, and it would probably have the same legal weight than it had for the Blacks.

Secondly, the Lordship system we see in fanfics is just fucked up.\\
I'm a French, so I'm more used to the French nobility system than the British one. But in France, Nobles inherited lands and assets, not names. Sirius willing everything he owned to Harry does not include his name. So even if Harry had inherited several titles, his name should be "Harry Potter, Lord of that place, that place, that place . . .", not "Lord Harry Potter Black Slytherin Peverell Gryffindor Merlin Lefay Pendragon".\\
Also, I happen to be a descendant of Charlemagne, King of the Francs. Does that mean I could inherit the throne of France if it still existed (and the Carolingians still holded it)? No, because pretty much all the Western Europeans are descendants of Charlemagne, and my position in the succession order would be in the Tens of millionth, if not hundreds. Being a descendant of a Founder does not make you his heir.\\
While I am at it, I find the idea of a vault betting sealed for 1000 years before being opened by Harry just stupid. Nobody would let money sit in a vault like this for so long. At the death of a wizard, his assets either go to the next of a kin (like when the Slytherins money went to the Gaunts), to the person he named in his will, or is probably seized by the Ministry if there is nobody to inherit. There is no Peverell vault because, if there was one, he was merged with the Potter one when the last Peverell married in the family, and so on

Finally, I want to say that all the flaws I just named can easily be ignored. It is easy to imagine an AU where Magical Britain is governed by an Aristocracy, where the nobility is linked to a name and not a title, or a land, and where "Magic" play a role in the succession process, permiting a title to go "dormant" until a rightfull sucessor appear.\\
But my problem with "Lord Harry" is that it seems to always go in pair with other awfull tropes. I don't want to read a story where being a Lord mean that Harry can have a harem "to pass down the names and titles" (and isn't that stupid, Harry can have 50 titles but his children must stick to one. And can't he just do several kid with one girl?). I don't want to read a story where kid are seasoned politicians, and where adult all bend backwards to let one teen do whatever he wants. I just don't want to read a story where Voldemort is just an after thought in a wish fulfilment fic.

​

So yeah, not a big fan of the trope, but it you know "good" ones, I'm still willing to try.

*** I'm not much inclined to either side, but for the heck of it, here are some counter points.

#+end_quote

It could be a society just on the eve of change. The general public has been pressuring for change, feeling badly represented, and the Death Eaters and Voldemort are a reaction -- and reactionary force -- to seeing their power dwindle. It makes, in the theory, for an interesting plotline, because those are the definition of all "interesting times" to live in.

#+begin_quote
  I also want to point that, from what we saw in canon ...
#+end_quote

This is, of course, all true. However, there are no Lords in Canon either, so all that this is saying is that you need to further tweak your setting to make it work. Introduce a stronger (in fact, I would say any at all, it doesn't exist in Canon) relation between blood, ancestry, and ability. I think I disagree that this is a requirement for Lord and Ladies, however. It's nice, but ultimately you can have political power without being special; in fact, that makes those in power all the more desperate to clinge to it.

#+begin_quote
  Secondly, the Lordship system we see in fanfics is just fucked up.
#+end_quote

I'll agree purely on the premise that 90% of everything is shit. But in more detail, yes, authors could put in more work, however, it's not entirely off-base as we see it -- though I very much suspect that is coincidence, not diligence. To wit, "Lord This" or "Lady That" is what you call(ed) peers, that is, anything below a duke (or duchess), e.g. the 7th Marquess of Salisbury, Robert Michael James Gascoyne-Cecil, would be politely addressed as "Lord Gascoyne-Cecil" (the duke gets the "Grace"). Which means, of course, that if Harry's family name /were/ Potter-Black, "Lord Potter-Black" would be the entirely correct way to address and announce him, but his actual title would be Earl of Godrics Hollow or whatever you come up with.

So for the FF to work, all you need now is not even to think up fancy earldoms, but simply stipulate that "Lord This" and "Lady That" is what you formally call wizards that fulfil any random criteria you can come up with, say, being member of the Wizengamot (and how's that for reversing cause and effect?), because it's simply a honorific, not a rank.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yup, the same joke exists in England. [[https://www.le.ac.uk/richardiii/science/genealogy.html][Everyone is related to Richard III.]] However, in terms of claiming inheritances of Founders: What does "Heir of Slytherin" /mean/, in the end? In Slytherin's case you get probably the most of all, because there's a damp cave and a basilisk, but mostly, it'd be the reputation. So the recognition is a formal act, if you can convince people to call you Lord Slytherin, well done. On the other hand, if you somehow added magical requirements ("magic recognises me as the Heir of ...") it's also straight-forward. Either way, someone could be called a heir of a Founder, even if he's the first in a while.

#+begin_quote
  While I am at it, I find the idea of a vault betting sealed for 1000 years before being opened by Harry just stupid.
#+end_quote

So do I, but not on the grounds that 1000 year old vaults are stupid, but the coincidence that it's Harry who opens it. Gringotts vaults are more like safe boxes, so physical assets like houses or land; if you handwaved the continued existence with magic or random legalese about Gringotts, it's reasonable enough for multiple vaults to exist, even if families have consolidated. What doesn't really make sense (and that's my point) is that they are containing useful things. First of all, a whole living room in a Gringotts vault actually /is/ a shit trope, and furthermore, no one in their right mind would keep his stuff split over umpteen vaults. 17610 Galleons in the Potter vault, 3056 Galleons and 11 Sickles in the Peverell vault, 24528 Knuts in Merlin's vault, say what? The Peverell vault, if it exists, is full of dust and nothing else.

So yeah, if you put some work into it, you can get something coherent out of it. Which is naturally the true problem, because you can get something coherent (if not necessarily good or interesting) out of everything if you put in some work, and as per above rule, 90% of all people just don't.

*** Not gonna lie as fucked as that system would be it'd fit right in with the rest of the canon series. Like, the government, as little as we see of it, is really fucked up. People thrown into Azkaban without a trial (Hagrid- PoA), the Minister can just execute a criminal without needing to consult with anyone, or interrogate him, or anything else (Barty Crouch Jr.- GoF), criminals can buy their way out of prison then go on to influence politics with all the money they throw around (ight this one happens in modern western countries too but it's still fucked). The more you look into it the more fucked their society is, so tying Wizengamot seats to noble families rather than through elected representatives works fine for me. As for taking on the names of the lordships someone inherits, I can see why they would. They'd want to show off and using the name of one of the powerful families they represent would totally be something wizards in these stories would do. I agree it can get ridiculous, though in particular I don't mind Harry taking on the name Potter-Black, whether it's a lord story or not, since it usually comes from being Sirius's godson, and in the lordship stories also his heir. Sirius is the closest thing Harry has to a parent, so it works, especially if there's some kind of adoption to go along with it.

*** I personally dislike if Harry is the lord to more than just the Potter and Black houses. None of the founders were noble and their lines pretty much died out. I'm just fine with him inheriting some goodies (not money, he already has too much of that) but I don't want him to be called Lord Potter-Black-Slytherin-Gryffindor. You could reason that the Potters weren't noble or most ancient, but I will argue that they were but were left off of the Sacred Twenty-Eight because the pureblood surpremist author believed them of having dirty blood because of their surname despite being from the Most Ancient and Noble (I'm assuming) House of Peverell. The Weasleys are a part of the directory simplu because they weren't Muggle-lovers at the time, but they would've been left out if they had been. Only a few of the Sacred Twenty-Eight are considered "Blood Traitors" (Abbott, Longbottom, MacMillan, Ollivander, Shacklebolt, Slughorn, and Weasley) while the rest are pureblood surpremists. The pureblood surpremist author (A Nott) thought that the Potters were from dirty blood because Potter is a common Muggle surname.

I will also say (in my own universe) that Harry doesn't necessarily own Hogwarts, but he does have a say in the Board of Directors because most pureblood houses are on the board and the Founders' families have a right to it. I do agree that it's stupid, though. I'm just saying that Harry will have more of a pull because of his titles and his family rights.
