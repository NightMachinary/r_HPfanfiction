** That's the sort line I'd expect in an entirely different scenario.

----

In sheer frustration, Harry jabbed his wand at the door blocking their way, “Confri-“

Harry started down at his suddenly empty hand, and looked up to see Dumbledore holding it gingerly between two fingers, an alarmed expression fading.

"Are you privy with the intricacies of the Blasting Curse's functioning coupled with enchantment, Harry?" Dumbledore finally asked in a mild tone.

“No,” he said, somewhat mulishly.

“Then I'd advise against casting rashly,” said Dumbledore, holding the wand out to Harry. “The enchantments on this door would cause some spectacular fireworks, should it be hit with such a curse, the kind that would result in an extended stay in St. Mungo's, given our immediate vicinity.”

Harry took on a slightly shamefaced expression. “Thank you for stopping me, Professor. I already filled my quota for Hospital Wing visits this year thanks to a mishap in Snape's-“

“Professor Snape's”

“/Professor/ Snape's classroom.” Harry's expression turned mulish again at the correction.

*** I only thought about my prompt because Hermione was already able to enchant objects in her very first term at Hogwarts and she became (at the very least) proficient with a curse while still being a first year. I don't know why, but I just think paper is one of the easier things to enchant and since Hermione is able to enchant goblin-made Galleons, of all things, with the Protean Charm in fifth year then enchanting paper with an admittedly dangerous curse would be feasible for fourth year Hermione.

Also, what scenario were you imagining. I want to say the Locket's cave, but, if I remember correctly, it was a wall that vanished and not a door. I would appreciate it if you could enlighten me.

**** I actually hadn't come up with anything more specific than Harry and Dumbledore attempting to get past an enchanted door.

It was a purely imaginary scenario, and not one from canon or fanfics.

***** Oh, thank you. It was still quite funny how the short text you wrote around my headline made it sound exactly like it was Dumbledore that was speaking.

****** Honestly, the line sounded more Dumbledore than Hermione, in my head.
