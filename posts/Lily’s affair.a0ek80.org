Alright so in the second Harry Potter book Harry was in dire need of help in the chamber of secrets and fawkes the Phoenix comes to the rescue. Well in fantastic beasts 2 Albus tells newt that a Phoenix will always helps a Dumbledore in dire need. And this can't be debunked by the fact that Harry looks like James because they have magic and can alter looks and Dumbledore is one of the most powerful wizards.


** No.

** The how come Fawkes didn't give a shit about Arianna? Are phoenixes inherently sexist? Food for thought... /s

On a more serious note, Rowling can't be trusted (in my opinion) on canon. Yes she created it and can do whatever she wants, but frankly her WoGs have been so erratic and all over the place, that taking them seriously is at best impossible and idiotic at worst.

** An interesting and original idea, not sure I would want to see it explored. But there IS canon evidence that Fawkes helped Harry for other reasons.

"'However,' said Dumbledore, speaking very slowly and clearly so none of them could miss a word, 'you will find that I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me. You will also find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.'"--Chamber of Secrets, Chapter Fourteen

"'[...] the greatest wizard in the world is Albus Dumbledore. Everyone says so. Even when you were strong, you didn't dare try and take over at Hogwarts. Dumbledore saw through you [...]'"--Chamber of Secrets, Chapter Seventeen, right before Fawkes comes and helps Harry,

Pretty sure there were scenes in the movie like this, too? It's been a long time since I've seen it.
