I basically don't care who's who but if Draco is involved he shouldn't be Carol. I don't think someone as cowardly as Draco should be in that position.

*** It would certainly help with the necessary sneaking around!

I have a headcanon that dark magic kinda runs on encryption. Like diffindo is 'plaintext', and you can heal a wound caused by it with episkey, but sectumsempra is 'encoded', so you need a key, which only snape has, to do anything with it. Or presumably it could be bruteforced by the likes of Dumbledore, or given enough time by your Pomfrey, but ultimately the darkness is about encryption.

Those names are also used in [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TriangRelations][TvTropes page on love triangles]]

**** I like the encryption metaphor.

With the Avada Kedavra, it either functions as a one time key pad or something without an inverse (when looking at the mathematics involved).
