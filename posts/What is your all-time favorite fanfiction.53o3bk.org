I'm tied between the Denarian Renegade and Lightning Dragons Roar.


** you should propably ask "and why" or else this is a rather pointless thread; that said:

linkffn(What You Leave Behind), because its exploration of a truly magical Hogwarts is simply amazing. Harrys characterization is really good and its Harry/Fleur which makes every story better anway... or something like that. Only current drawback, hadnt update in a year (though not abdonded, gotta have patience).

Or if you want a finished one: linkffn(Resurrexit) because of how dark and yet engaging it is. An intresing mystery that affects Harry in a really well setuped way.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

** At the moment, it's The Merging. I really like the Tonks, Sirius, and [[/spoiler][Narcissa]] (ch19 spoiler) in that one, and the concepts and plots are really interesting. Even the Dumbledore isn't all that bad...

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8240514/1/The-Son-of-Lord-Voldemort]]

While the author's grammar for the first third of the story or so needs some work, the story itself and especially the world-building are very good. There are little bits and pieces I don't like, but I've never cared much about them, as high quality fics where Harry is blood adopted by Voldemort are so incredibly rare.

These too. Different but still amazing.

**** Well, you typed an apostrophe. That's pretty easy to mistake for a single quotation mark, especially for British and Australian authors where single quotation marks are common for delimiting speech. On most keyboards, it's a lot easier to type an apostrophe than a single quotation mark.

Anyway; I really don't care if its more common there, or is more convenient- i've grown accustomed to quotation marks, so it makes it really hard for me to read stories without it.

HPMoR!

Seriously, while there are fandics with better prose and pacing, HPMoR is amazing for the intricacies of its plotting, references, foreshadowing, jokes, quotables, etc. I am constantly finding new things to appreciate in it.
