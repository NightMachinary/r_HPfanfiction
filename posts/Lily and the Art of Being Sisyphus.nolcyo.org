FemHarry x Tom are my fave pairing right now and I really enjoyed reading this because I love this author's style and the story itself was very interesting.

The only thing is. I have the attention span of a goldfish. Okay, not entirely true, I know for a fact I can read up to 700k+ words slow burn fics and still be interested but this one was REALLY slow pacing. I stopped while Lily was still 5 I think.

Sometimes I skip through several chapters of fics that are this long and usually I can still understand what is going on or make the connections. I did this with this fic and ended up in the scene where Lily Ginny and Luna are in DADA and learning about Boggarts? I got bored of that scene too because it was moving but I couldn't see where it was moving and I was losing interest.

So can anyone help me with this fic because I really want to read it but it's too slow for me. Should I just power through the beginning, will it get more interesting to the point that I can't put the fic down? (For reference I already met Death/Harry and he likes Lily and doesn't approve of her friendship with Wizard Lenin). Is there a point I can jump to and begin reading from there? Can someone summarize the slower parts so I can jump ahead to the good bits?

Basically I just need a guide for understanding this fic and the important parts because where I am doesn't feel like much is happening or will happen for a long time. Unless you (people who have read this fic) say it's necessary I read all of it of it which I can try to do I just need reassurance that it'll pay off eventually.


** I would give up on it. The pace stays slow, and it is a confusing story in general. I finally gave up maybe 40 chapters in.

** It has some interesting points and concepts, but really it quickly became a stand-in for an author SI/complete OC.

Swap a few names, change a few bits of the setting, and you've got an original universe story that's not Harry Potter.

** If the writing style failed to grasp your interest, it's safe to stop. This fic is most notable for author's unique way of weaving the narration and it doesn't change throughout.
