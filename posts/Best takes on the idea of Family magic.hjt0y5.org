I'm looking for fics that include Family magic as part of their story. Generally speaking I prefer longer fics and usually prefer completed fics where possible. Hit me up with your best Family Magic fics!

Thanks in advance!

  What if Sirius decided to stay in England and deliver on his promise to raise Harry instead of hiding somewhere sunny? Changes abound with that one decision...

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

** I've never managed to finish this story. I always abandon reading it half-way through, because Harry ends up becoming this all-powerful being who doesn't even resemble Harry anymore. Objectively, it's an entertaining fic though! linkffn(10709411)

The worldbuilding, politics, and magicbuilding in this is /beautiful/. Highly recommend. End's a tiny bit rushed, but still so freaking cool.
