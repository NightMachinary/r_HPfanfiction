Lots of fics reference in-universe books about the Young Harry Potter Adventures he was supposedly getting up.to pre-Hogwarts.

Are there any fics that actually tell those stories?


** You might enjoy chapters 190-193 from Rorschach's Blot's Odd Ideas. It features Lockhart raising Harry and writing the stories while he takes Harry on adventures (for the sole sake of writing the books). linkffn(2565609)

*** I was kind of hoping for more of a straight up "This is the full text of one of the Boy-Who-Lived stories Ginny Weasley and Romilda Vane grew up with and Indy!Harry sues over", but this'll do I guess.
