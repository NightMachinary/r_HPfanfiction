Is there any fic where Lily and James are not so popular people and no-one apart from Sirius and Lupin tell Harry about them because no-one really liked them too much? We already know that James used to be a bully. Perhaps no female friend of Lily shows up because she had no friends.

I know the terrible Potters are common in WBWL stories, but I am looking for stories set in the "canon" Universe.


** Linkffn(The Fall of The House of Potter) is the only one I can think of.

  AU from year five onwards. At the end of year six Harry finds himself once again isolated and prisoned at the Dursleys. The end of Book six never happened in this tale. Dumbledore has plans that include Harry, but not the way Harry thinks.

** Who Is Harry Potter? by BeepKeeper (unfinished). It's a delightful story in which James, Lily, and Sirius are all amoral, selfish people (and Alice and Frank go along with it to protect Neville), but they're really only in the first two chapters. linkffn(13218646)

  When Harry arrives at Gringotts, Hagrid produces the key but there's nothing else proving that the child is Harry Potter. What if there is a dark story behind the origin of the Boy-Who-Lived. Bashing Potters, Sirius and Dumbles. Good Goblins and Harry's adventures at Hogwarts. HEA in the end.
