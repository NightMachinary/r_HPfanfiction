I'm looking for fics where Harry is surviving as the last person on earth, or where he at least believes himself to be the last person on earth.

An example of this might be "I am Legend" or something along the lines of Harry trying to make his way as the only one left in the world.

Thanks

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

** Not the last man, but the last wizard in this one that was updated recently. I'm having a ton of fun with it, but it may not be what you are looking for linkffn(9310008).

  Earth has nothing left. Earth is no longer green. Earth has no life. Earth has no magic. This is a story of exodus, as the last two magical beings fight to escape earth before magic is completely gone. Salvation has a new name, and that name is Pandora. Only muggles shall remain. Now Full story!

** For a chapter or two he is: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5178251/1/30-Minutes-That-Changed-Everything]]

Only one I can think of off the top of my head. Will look later when not feeding gran breakfast.

** Another one not quite what you're looking for, but still related. Harry's among the last bit of humanity desperately holding out against a zombie apocalypse. Includes a lot of political drama and character deaths.

  A year has passed since the dead started returning to life. The fate of those hoping to survive and rebuild rests on the best and the worst of humanity, both wizards and Muggles, with their political ideologies and the ravenous undead in between, and it's up to Healer Harry Potter to save as many as he can in the crossfire. A Harry Potter Zombie Apocalypse Fanfiction. HP/AG.

** True at the end of the first scene of [[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/harry-potter/dimensional-shift-hp-private-sneak-peek/][Dimensional Shift]]. Then he goes dimension hopping. A few of those dimensions only seem to have one being left, and he gets some tagalongs.
