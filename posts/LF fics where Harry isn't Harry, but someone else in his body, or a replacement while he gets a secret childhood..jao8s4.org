I have seen some fics of harry being possessed by someone else by early childhood, or being taken by someone in the wizarding world and replaced by a golem or a transfigured house elf, and I really would love to read tropes like that again.

  Harriet Potter died at one year old. What was left of her slogged through life, alive in body and mind but not soul. Six years later she was finally cremated. This is not the story of Harriet Potter. This is the story of the brilliant flame who inherited her place, and her journey in the strange world of humans.

  Draco Malfoy awakens in Gryffindor Tower at the start of his sixth year with no memory of how he arrived.Can Draco use Harry's lingering impressions of the world to guide him? Can he navigate the politics of being the Boy Who Lived? And how long before he tips off Ron or Hermione?A bodyswap subversion and bromance, this story features a Ron Weasley convinced they are mates, a Hermione keen on the Dark Arts, a surprisingly friendly Blaise Zabini, and a Luna Lovegood who's just mad enough to find this all perfectly ordinary.
