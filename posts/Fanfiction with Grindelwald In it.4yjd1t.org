I've never read any fanfiction that features Grindelwald actually doing anything in the story, excluding /Lord of the Marauders/(epic crackfic, by the way), and /Harry Potter and the Boy-Who-Lived./

Anyone read any fics where Grindelwald has a part? Preferably where he helps or works against Harry.


** Well, linkffn(The Skitterleap by enembee) is a fic where Grindlewald beat Dumbledore and that is the world that resulted.

linkffn(The Magnate by Halt.CPM) is a Voldemort won fic that features Grindlewald in the later portions. Not quite yet to the point of Harry and Grindlewald having any interactions.

There's some fucking terrible fic where Arcturus Black somehow gets a hold of baby Harry, and then proceeds to break Grindlewald out of Nurmengard, but I forget the name.

linkffn(The One He Feared by Taure) has Grindlewald in the context of Dumbledore v Grindlewald in the first chapter.

And that's all I've got off the top of my head. Which is a shame, because I think Grindlewald has great possibilities, being essentially the dark!Dumbledore.

  Voldemort's mastery of dark power was unrivaled in history. Grindelwald's legendary charisma came a hairsbreadth from bringing Europe to its knees. "Now, which one will it be for you, Mr. Potter?" Massive AU, Durmstrang Harry

** There's an in-progress story linkffn(Child of Hogwarts, part II: The Marauder Legacy by AimeretVivre) that has some Grindelwald. In the first series installment, I think he plays a role in a chapter or two. Without spoiling too much, and this is mostly conjecture, he'll play a limited role in Harry's education and research regarding Horcruxes. This is a fic based on Harry being pulled away from the abusive Dursleys and raised by Dumbledore and McGonagall at the castle. Interesting story, starts summer before Year 2; it took too much straight from canon in the first installment but it has tempered that habit since the middle of that story and I think the author is getting really good at writing this as she goes along.
