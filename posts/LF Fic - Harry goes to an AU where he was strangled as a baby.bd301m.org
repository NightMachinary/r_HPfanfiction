As the title says. I read this years ago, and recently I've gotten back into reading HP fanfiction. This one was one of my favourites at the time (whether it still will be, will remain to be seen) and I cant find it.

​

I remember at the beginning, Harry was the only survivor of the war. Fawkes and Nagini are with him, and I believe Nagini was under the Imperious the entire time. I cant remember how he gets to the AU but when he does, Sirius and Remus are alive, his parents are still dead and so is he (strangled to death rather than AK'ed), and the one thing that stands out is his Patronus. I believe he had the stag, werewolf and grim.

​

Another scene I'm pretty sure happened in this, was he presented the AU Nagini to Snape for potions ingredients, and Voldemort was still human. If anyone knows of this fic can you please let me know? I've been looking for about 3 days and not having any luck

  Harry won the war against Voldemort but at a terrible price.Fawkes gives him another chance in a new world where he died as an infant and where Voldemort still lurks in the shadows...but not for long, because when one exists the other cannot survive. AU
