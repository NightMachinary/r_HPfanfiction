I'm a voracious reader and I have a nice 3 day weekend to become one with my couch. Give me your fics that you're working on! Whether it's an old crumbling parchment of a fic that never got attention or as fresh and popular as a newborn Voldemort. Let's go!

What pairing? Any.

What rating? Who cares.

Long or short? Whatever!

My only nos are anything just written as shock value.

I will happily leave a review for you or a kudos if you don't want feedback.

I use ffn and ao3.

Let's do this! I'll start in chronological order and keep going.


** I'm currently writing "The Granger Principle".

  It seemed like a routine assignment for CI5 officers Ron Weasley and Harry Potter: Investigate a physicist who had caught the attention of some unsavoury elements. Little did they know that Dr Hermione Granger would turn out to have more secrets than Ron would have thought possible.

** Fic 1: Very Dark AU with Cedric Diggory in the Cursed Child Universe. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22127926/chapters/52816285]]

I love this one and am very proud of it but it doesbt get many reads because of Cursed Child dislike.

Fic 2: My current WIP is another AU 'What if' where Draco ends up accepting Dumbledore's offer. People tell me they like this.

*** I can agree with the cursed child dislike. However, I shall persevere! I'll give the first one a go for now and maybe come back for the second. I really don't think Draco gets enough credit as a character, even from his real creator.

Edit: this fic is better than the source material. Which sounds like shade but isn't. I'd recommend for anyone who really wanted to like the cursed child.

  What would happen if Draco, Hagrid, and Ron hadn't colored Harry's perception of the houses so much before the sorting. My take on a Harry sorted differently story. I have a pairing for this fic in mind, but who knows where the story will take itself? Should slowly diverge from canon as a different Harry with different friends makes different choices.

** I highly recommend the series by the TheDivineComedian. Read slowly though as each story is pretty emotionally draining. The author is amazing and writes really well thought out twists and beautiful prose.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13719279][Still life with a skull]] is a really interesting take on Lupin teaching in PoA and the theme of secrets.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12540852/chapters/28558256][They're hiding inside me]] how the marauders try and cope with the Black family.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14760663][Blackpool]] just an amazing and heartbreaking story looking at memory. So painful but worth it.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13281801/chapters/30392982][The Age of Lies]] a bit lighter and my new version of canon for rainy days

Also if you like wolfstar then I highly recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1918284/chapters/4139571][Remain in the light]] by Veeagainst.

For books that are worthy of Rose, Scorpius and Albus then I recomend the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/438892][The Stygian Trilogy]] by Slide. Their work on the HPverse is incredible, I also highly recommend their work on good slytherins during the 2nd war.
