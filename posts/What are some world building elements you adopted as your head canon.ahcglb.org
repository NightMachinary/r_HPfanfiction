Small (or big) background stuff that just make too much sense to not be canon. Or maybe you just loved the idea and now just cant think of the Wizarding World without it. I have a few of my own:

1. Hagrid (and other half giants) being the result of some kind of magical cross breeding rather than natural sex. Cmon, we all know it cant possibly work the regular way.

2. Wizard nations being different than their Muggle counter parts. I love that. Whether they are having older borders, or its mythical cities, long lost in the Muggle world, or anything like that. Its just so weird and unlikely that wizard and muggle states would be identical. I also love stuff like Goblin nation, treaties, cities and cultures of different magical beings. They may be a bit clichee at this point, but it makes everything much bigger.

3. The basilisk from the Chamber of Secrets being a defensive measure for Hogwarts rather than an ethnic cleansing WMD.


** Snitches are magically enchanted such that they are more likely to fly across the vision of the seeker whose team is currently in the lead. It fixes the issue of the parts of the game with the Quaffle not mattering in most matches, and it makes what Krum was able to accomplish in the QWC that much more impressive.

** Does making magical combat deeper count as world building? If so in my head there's like three extremely hard skills that a fighter has to master for years. So here they are

Combat Legilimency Combat Divination (Basically Precognition from Star Wars.) Combat Apparation ( So master tiny jumps in the middle of a battle, and apparating within Anti-Apparation wards/jinxes.)

Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and Voldemort have mastered all of these and in my head Harry manages these three after canon

***** Magic is cast through the Ancient Language, and in most cases the effects are instantaneous. Since the other aspect of magic is telepathic, a battle between mages is a duel where each side has to counter the other's attack the moment they think.

One notable instance of this is in book three: Brisingr, where the wizard on the heroes' side duels an enemy wizard during the siege of a city. The good-guy wizard drops dead, and the enemy wizard has all the water in his body forced out, leaving him a pile of dust.

Arithmancy is rigorous and uses numbers and is more, for lack of a better word, scientific in its approach, based on how it is described.

Divination is like, "She threw some trash on the ground and sought meaning from how it landed." It is far more "artistic" in the means by which it comes to its conclusion.

In that regard, it isn't the "predicting the future" aspect that Hermione hates about Divination, it is the lack of rigor and lack of objectivity that she hates.

******* Well, that is a big part, but I feel that is just a symptom of the underlying issue that Divination is as accurate as throwing a dart at a dart board, you know? Yes, sometimes there are legit prophecies, but there are sometimes where the prophecy seems self-fulfilling.

​

Look at The Prophecy in canon. The prophecy is made that only Harry can kill Voldemort and that he will be marked his equal and all this, right? Harry gets marked because Voldemort goes after him, which in turn makes Lily die to protect him initiating the blood wards over him when Voldemort kills Lily, which is likely the death that causes the Horcrux in Harry to form, thus marking him as his equal.

​

So, had Snape never overheard the prophecy, Voldemort wouldn't have targeted Harry, which means he wouldn't have specifically gone after him, which means Lily wouldn't have sacrificed herself to protect Harry, which means the blood wards wouldn't exist and the Horcrux not formed, which means, in theory, anyone could have destroyed the Horcruxes and killed Voldemort, since Harry wouldn't have been one.

​

So even this prophecy was basically just a random interpretation of something said or seen into what the future held.

Throwing darts at a dart board.

This is why I always felt that Hermione hated Divination. Because Trelawney always made it seem like she had no idea what she was doing, was constantly just making things up, and thus, fell back to predicting Harry's death since Harry didn't start Divination until he already had 2 years at Hogwarts where he nearly died and nearly/should have died as a baby.

There could be an argument to be made here that because of the way that Harry defeated Voldemort, namely by dying (however briefly) to destroy the pseudo-horcrux in his curse scar, that Trelawney's natural talent at predicting the future, however spotty it might look to someone without the right mindset to comprehend it, kept pushing her to point out Harry's oncoming demise, regardless of whether the specifics were accurate or not.

***** My own headcanon is that that's how it /starts/ at OWL level, but, well, just like a lot of current mathematics got its beginning in stats - which, hilariously, arose out of numerology* - it leads on to being able to do some useful things beyond that.

And, bluntly, a predictive tool that's centred in magic is /precisely/ what you need for spell creation. If you can mathematically predict what happens when you wave your wand /so/ and say /this/ incantation, you're only a step short of being able to reason back from effect to cause.

* It goes like this: the rabbis of old used numerology to find interesting things in their scriptures, a central discipline in Kabbalism. Mediaeval muslims borrowed the idea of applying numbers to texts to perform frequency analysis to figure out which of the various holy writings they had were authentic and which not (reasoning that different authors would have a different 'fingerprint' of word and letter usage). Statistical frequency analysis begat early cryptography and suddenly the likes of Fermat and Descartes and Fourier were taking mathematics beyond trig and accounting and doing all kinds of crazy stuff with it.

** I'm writing about Ollivander's wand shop, and so I've built up an elaborate headcanon for how their shop operates.

1. It's not just Ollivanders who work there. At any given time they keep a staff of about 10 people, some of whom are apprentices. They employ Gatherers who are experts on the wand wood, Beast Hunters who are experts on the animals they get the cores from, and Wandsmiths who decide how to put all the materials together and make the final product. But only Garrick Ollivander and his son sell the wands.
2. They use nonfatal surgery to get the heartstrings from sleeping dragons.
3. The wand creation spell requires a long, intense incantation and requires the Wandsmith to add his or her blood. You need a bit of the magic flowing through your own veins to bring the wand to life.
4. The wandshop is three stories, and a spiral staircase takes you through the building: the store is the first story, at the bottom; the workshop where everyone works is on the second story; and the two Ollivanders live in a flat on the third story.
5. Blood-purists hate the Ollivanders for their centuries-old tradition of selling wands to Muggle-borns, and it often makes them a target for Dark wizards. Even more so when they choose to employ Muggle-borns at the wandshop.
6. When they're bored, the crew at Ollivander's likes to pass the time by dueling, which is both practical (see #5) and fun as hell.
7. The son, Todd Ollivander, came up with the wand-hidden-in-umbrella idea for Hagrid.

Personal headcanon is that heartstrings do not have anything to do with a dragon's heart. Like all the other cores they can be harvested without actually hurting the beast. "Heartstring" is just a name some fibrous growths on the underside of a dragon's chest scales so named because of the location they are found in.

** - Dark Magic being similar to black magic in our own culture, in that Christian wizards take issue with magical rituals that seem repulsive to them, either because they defy moral expectations or because they are just for the sake of granting the practitioners more magical power. With time a more practical brand of magic becomes the norm and magical practices are moralized to the point that most wizards and witches don't bother learning magic that isn't useful for everyday purposes or for a career.
- Building upon that, a lot of magic that is associated with women starts being seen as dark or taboo, especially if it's perceived as sexual and doesn't involve procreation.
- Traditional purebloods are intensely disdainful of religion and they resent that Hogwarts follows a muggle calendar and gives children vacations on Christian Holidays (I can understand that maybe Christmas is as good a time as any to give kids a winter break, but I can't see purebloods wanting to have their Christmas home for Easter instead of getting to have their kids around in more magically significant dates).\\

Yule was a Germanic holiday that predated Christianity, and do you really think it's a coincidence that bunnies and eggs have a common theme with Christ's rebirth?

Also, pagan does not necessarily mean non-religious, just of different religious significance. Pagan holidays and rituals were/are mostly to do with the changing seasons, the natural world, and conceptual ideas like sacrifice.

**** Sorry, maybe I shouldn't have said Christian. Let's go with religious. I think there's an assumption that because JK incorporated larger magical lore like Merlin having existed and gone to Hogwarts, that purebloods are pagan. But I don't really see the Blacks or Malfoys for example being pagans either. The Malfoys mingled with the British Royal Class, so I'm guessing they accepted whatever muggle religion the Regent followed until the separation would have made start disdaining of it entirely. I don't necessarily see the Blacks celebrating the solstices either. I think they would more likely to pay attention to dates that marked something magically relevant than to celebrate something to do with nature, so when I say magically significant holidays, I don't mean pagan. Paganism is muggle enough that quite frankly I think some of the supremacists would just turn their nose up at it.

** 2 becomes interesting if you start to calculate in the effects of Grindelwald, Stalin, and Mao.

Given the nature of Grindelwalds goals he likely planned to align the two worlds. Chances are he probably destroyed all the smaller states in the former HRE first off. Then as the Reich expanded he did likewise to elsewhere.

Once Stalin and Mao learn of the magical world I have no doubt it becomes fall in line or be annihilated, particularly if they can get muggle born to their side. A bit of brain washing might be all it takes.

So post war, much of the European magical world in shambles. I can see am ICW mandate to establish as best they are able a world following borders as they are that day.

Furthermore, outside of Europe and parts of the Americas I doubt the statute of secrecy was well received. I could easily see the 1950s and into 1960s being filled with former Grindelwald soldiers and others from the less devastated statue supporters waging a pacification campaign in Africa, SE Asia, elsewhere as those areas made to throw off the Statute at the same time as Grindelwald's War after having it enforced through European colonialism in the first place.

In more closed locations like behind the curtain and in China you have the ICW having to cut deals to maintain the secret and peace with madmen, particularly of you go with a nuclear radiation is anti-magic kind of world building.

  Hagrid (and other half giants) being the result of some kind of magical cross breeding rather than natural sex. Cmon, we all know it cant possibly work the regular way.
#+end_quote

Why can't it work the regular way? It's magic. Magic can literally create fully biologically functioning animals, down to every organ and vein and cell, with transfiguration and conjuration. And you don't even need to know about any of that, you don't need to KNOW what each organ is or how it's shaped or what it DOES in order to just make it all up out of nowhere and have it work! Mages don't need to take biology courses to manipulate biology. They just do it. You think that kind of power can't do a bit of DNA crossing and have it come out functional? Polyjuice gone wrong can do that already, giving a human (Hermione) perfectly functional cat features mixed with her human ones. And then there are centaurs, who are literally naturally born half horse and humanoid all the time too.

I don't see why it's so outrageous for inter-species reproduction to work just fine, with magic doing its thing. If you think otherwise, that's just you refusing to accept canon itself for what it is, because you "just think it shouldn't work". And that isn't headcanon, that's denial of text and evidence. It doesn't make sense at all to think up some random alternative instead of what's plainly already there, and shown to work.

** The many muddled branches of magic. Not all magic is created equal or works the same way although its effects can sometimes be replicated. Combined with various cultural and historical complications the divisions are most often overlooked.

1. Wizardry is magic born of will and whimsy. Most of what are considered charms, hexes, and transfiguration are acts of wizardry. The common use of wizardry is directly linked to the so called Wizarding World's aesthetic including the use of wands.

2. Witchcraft is the art of utilising the the magic inherent in nature/objects/the stars. This is most commonly seen in potions, but includes some forms of divination. More powerful, but more limited than Wizardry; Witchcraft is mostly considered outdated in the modern era.

3. Invocation is the art of calling on the magic of something greater than ones self. The animagus transformation, the patronis spell, the utterance of prophecy, and Snape trying to compel the Marauders Map are all examples of invocation.

The Master of Death is a myth. The Deathly Hollows are not a set, but simply three related and powerful magical artifacts.

1. The Wand is cursed. Those who wield is are destined to die of violent conflict.

2. The Stone is cursed. Those who use it are driven to take their own lives to be with their loved ones.

3. The Cloak is blessed, once part of something greater than man. Its owner cannot die, often manifesting in the form of Plot Armour.

Both Harry and Dumbledore chose to die (2), letting themselves be killed (1), but since Harry is the owner of the Cloak events occur allowing him to return to life (3).

*** I wonder if the Cloak's protection only works on the current owner, and James bestowed Harry his Cloak when he was born, or heard of Voldemort coming to him? It partially navigated events in such a way that would cause Voldemort's initial defeat.

I'd actually like to see a scene where BOTH Lily and James concoct a plan to protect Harry through two means; protection of love and inheritance, mostly because so much credit goes to Lily but so little to James.

You know what, screw it, here's my take:

--------------

"There has been a prophecy..." Dumbledore's countenance was grave. He looked every bit his ninety-nine years.

"Then it looks like we have to pull a fast one on the Dark Lord, eh Lilliekins?"

"Ugh. I told you to stop calling me that. We're parents, now!"

"It's a big responsibility, I know."

"Which? Pulling one over Voldemort or raising children?"

"Yes. We'll need a plan." James' eyes lingered on Dumbledore's wand. A very familiar wand. "Have you heard of the Three Deathly Hallows, honey?"

"You have like seven copies of the Tales of Beetle the Bard lying around the house. So, no. Never heard of it."

"Well, there's a little Potter secret. I'll just gift my good luck charm to young Harry and problem solved!"

"I don't think magical briefs are going to save Harry from Voldemort's favorite spell." Albus blushed. "OH! The cloak?"

"Yes the cloak! What are briefs?"

"I think they are court documents, mister Potter," Albus glanced at Lily with a knowing smile. "Though, a magical pair could be quiet useful indeed."

Lily sighed. "I don't think it's enough. Good luck, sure, but he's barely a year old. I'll have to think of something. How do you even know about this, Albus? Is it a real prophecy?"

"My Divination professor told me, and was completely unawares that she did, so I have complete faith in its authenticity. I am truly sorry."

James waved a hand. "My Lily will outsmart him. Get him to take an unknowing vow or something. We'll be /fine/." James leaned in, speaking in a stage whisper to Dumbledore: "She's actually terrifying. Death might be preferable. Help!"

Albus choked. Lily snorted.

"You know, there's some precedent to an unknowing vow," Lily said, scheming.

"Yeah?"

"Have I ever regaled you with the Tales of Beetle the Bard?"

"Damnit, woman, I'm a wizard not a mind reader!"

"You... You know that one makes you the other, right?"

"Shit. See? Help me, Albus!"

"Unfortunately," Dumbledore tried to get them back on track, "I have on good authority that Severus Snape knows at least part of the prophecy..."

"Oh! Severus!" "Oh Snivelus!" Lily and James announced at the same time.

"Does he still have a crush on me?"

"Very much, I'm afraid. And he is in league with Death Eaters."

"Perfect. Here's what I need you to do, Albus...."

** Well, my headcanon document is [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gy6FOtx28w3JPDeDBOcch0fpuvTEnNwr/view?usp=sharing][here]].

However, that's "headcanon" in a different sense to the meaning used in the OP. My understanding of the word "headcanon" is quite literal. It is canon as it is in your head i.e. it is what you genuinely believe to be canon, whether explicitly stated or not in the books. Assuming you are a reasonable person who only believes things on the basis of evidence, your headcanon is limited to the things which you consider to be implicit within canon, or at the very least supported by some measure of canon evidence.

Stuff that you have completely invented would not be part of your headcanon, because you don't actually believe it to be part of canon. You just wish it was.

With that clarification out of the way, here are the elements which I wish were canon but do not have enough evidence to support them (or completely contradict canon), which I nonetheless generally incorporate into my fics:

- There are approximately 20,000 wizards and witches in wizarding Britain, around half of whom attend Hogwarts. The rest decline their Hogwarts invites and choose home schooling instead, which is the global norm in magical communities. Parents of home-schooled students often group together to educate the children within their community and sometimes these groupings develop into what might be comparable to a Muggle school. But they are schools of magic rather than true magical schools, where the school itself is magical (see below).

- Hogwarts has more than one teacher per subject. The teachers we know are the heads of department e.g. Snape is the Potions Master, Flitwick the Charms Master, etc.

- Attending a true magical school (i.e. one of the eleven in canon, plus two I add) is like having a real life Choose Your Own Adventure. Harry's adventure was by far the most extreme because of the importance of his fate, but everyone at Hogwarts has at least some adventure thrown their way by the magic of the school, which warps fate so that things just work out nicely for everyone involved. Of course, not everyone will answer the call to adventure (looking at you, Percy Weasley). But essentially the rules of reality at Hogwarts and other true magical schools do literally work on story book logic. It is this magic, not any set of literal protections or enchantments, which makes Hogwarts so magical, and which also makes anyone hesitant to attack the school. Any attacker of the school has just cast themselves as the villain of a fairy tale. They are quite literally tempting fate.

- In general, countries which host a true magical school have a much higher standard of wizardry in the general population than the rest of the world, and within that group Britain has the highest proportion of properly educated wizards, being the only country in the world with a true magical school which exclusively accepts individuals from its own nation.

- The nations with true magical schools are the "Great Powers" of the magical world.

- The thirteen true magical schools are: 1. Brazil - Castelobruxo - Amazon Rainforest 2. China - Xifang Xuexiao ("School of the West") - Jade Mountain (Chinese/Tibetan Himalayas) 3. Egypt - Wadi Al Mujawis ("Valley of the Magi") - Theban Necropolis 4. France - Beauxbatons - Pyrennes 5. Great Britain - Hogwarts - Scottish Highlands 6. India - Suvaloka - Mount Meru (Indian Himalayas) 7. Japan - Mahoutokoro - Minami Iwo Jima 8. Persia - Alcaraz (Palace) - Badab-e Surt 9. Peru - El Dorado - Peruvian Altiplano 10. Russia - Koldovstoretz - Mount Elbrus 11. Norway - Durmstrang - Svalbard 12. Uganda - Uagadou - Mountains of the Moon 13. USA - Ilvermorney - Mount Greylock, Massachusetts.

- House-elves do not reproduce biologically but spontaneously appear in sufficiently grand, magical properties. Further their bond of service is to that property, not to an individual. Their Master is whoever owns the property. As owner of the property, the Master can free the house-elf in the same way he could choose to sell off a portion of the property.

- The significant gap in magical talent between normal wizards (even talented ones like Aurors) and wizards like Dumbledore is not natural. In normal times, there would be a bell curve of magical talent. Dumbledore is at the very top end of that bell curve, but there would exist a small number of "almost Dumbledores" who fill the ranks between him and the average wizard. So while Dumbledore might be able to take on 20 Aurors, he would struggle against 2-3 "almost Dumbledores" attacking him simultaneously. However, in the 1960s and 1970s Voldemort systematically killed most of the "almost Dumbledores" in the world (maybe around 100 wizards globally). This is why it took him much longer to take the Ministry the first time around than the second.

- In the event of a truly serious breach of the International Statute of Secrecy, the Department of Mysteries would just reset the day.

- Catching the snitch doesn't give you any points, it just ends the game. Which makes it strategically important as it allows you to end the game on your terms, but it's not a game winner all on its own.

Would it be fairer to say that House-elves are bound to /land/ or /ideas/ rather than property? Over time, their magic and obligations were just fitted to form to modernity in a sense. Dobby's obsession over Harry and the Hogwarts elves over, well, Hogwarts, would encompass that.

The idea of land ownership is relatively new, in a historical sense. For most of human history, "land" either belonged to everyone or the King.

Would White Squirrel's idea of biologically breeding house-elves into their current state be so far off? Elves seem characteristically similar to dogs in their need to please their master, who were artificially selected to have such a personality.

House elves in my mind are basically intelligent, magical, dogs; bred to the point where their magic is powerful and unique but only because of hundreds of generations of masters needed mundane things done efficiently and discreetly.

I guess a point against house-elves being domesticated is their apparently small litter size and incredibly long life-span. The only reason the animals we /have/ domesticated are because they either produce large litters or have short life-spans, or both. Barring either of those, and evolution just doesn't work things out quick enough to be useful. Elephants, for example, would be amazing pack animals, but they just aren't good for breeding.

Well, not really sure what you mean by "fairer" but this was not the concept I was proposing, no. I was referring to a legal estate of land, not the actual physical stuff.

**** Maybe because when you're an animagus, you're closer to your inner animal and basic instincts whereas Occulmency is all about sophistication and control? It's the way I've interpreted it anyway.

***** Yeah, I'd say Occlumency and Legilimency require your thoughts to be very organized with a clear sense of self identification. You have to always know who you are when you are peering into the mind of another, and must always be guarded against intrusion when shielding your mind from others.

Animagus is kind of like letting yourself be open to the animal instinct, to just let go and be wild, even for a split second. The training for the other mind arts would make this task a great deal more difficult.

** These are some from an abandoned plotbunny i was going to write.

Magic comes from two sources the world around you and yourself/emotions. certain spells cannot be used by drawing in ambient magic such as the three unforgivables. In that vain, Fiendfyre is a physical manifestation of the casters rage and it's fuel source is ALL magic, that's why it often turns on the caster and can kill horcruxes it literally devours magic.

Harry Potter is on par power wise with Dumbledore, Grindewald and Voldemort, he is just less skilled than them because of age and experience since he is Tom Riddles Equal.

Skill is more important than power, Harry could throw out spells left and right while being the most powerful student of his year, but he'd lose to a wizard that is lesser than him in power if only because of the skill gap.

I like the idea of Familiars and being able to talk to familiars also the idea that Christian Wizards have different spells and rituals to Pagan Wizards always intrigues me and I subscribe to the idea that Gryffindor was a Christian while Slytherin was a Druid, I also like the Idea that the main argument that caused Gryffindor and Slytherin to split was the idea of accepting Muggleborns in, not because they are Muggleborn but because most of them are predominantly Christian and Slytherin being one of the last true Druids in England would take offense.

******* Apart from the Pope having actual armies being something that was centuries in the future when Hogwarts was founded. During /that/ period what would later become the Papal states had only just stopped being a client duchy of the Frankish Empire and was run by the Count of Tusculum.

Now, if Salazar really was as Basque as his name suggests, he'd have a fairly major hate-boner for the Franks and their religion, since they were reconquista-ing through his homeland at the time (Vasconia, lit. "Land of the Basques" was on its way to becoming Gascony at the time) and the upheaval of the Umayyad conquest had only just settled down.

What he certainly was not was a Druid: they were a thousand years dead by the time Hogwarts was founded, the Romans slaughtered the lot of them as being the focus of resistance to their rule in their Gaulish and Briton possessions.

******* Also, the whole etymology of Saint Patrick driving the "snakes" from Ireland and furthering the Catholic church's goals would make a lot of sense.

Slytherin probably grew up or came of age around the time the Catholic church got started in Ireland (5th century) and [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Saint_Patrick_Catholic_Church_%28Junction_City%2C_Ohio%29_-_stained_glass%2C_Saint_Patrick_-_detail.jpg][this guy looks a lot like a wizard]]. Saint Patrick was a Muggle-Born from Rome and spread Christianity to Slytherin's stomping grounds, likely festering his animosity towards it all.

******* History is written by the victors. It's pretty easy to spread disinformation and twist facts in your favor when you can control the narrative.

People also readily assume all history progresses toward some "ideal" good -- so it's easy to paint the current standards through the lens of history in a sense that "we were wrong, idiots, and ignorant back in the day, now we know better," from a certain point of view.

While I don't go overboard to naming Harry something like Lord Potter-So-Many-Hyphens-Gryffindor, I quite like the ideal behind a noble kind of status when it comes to the Ancient and Noble Houses.

I've always loved worldbuiling that has to do with elemental magic and nature's innate magical properties, so it makes sense to me that synthetics, being completely devoid of any ambient magic (life), can't be altered by or used with magic and that magical folk loath them as freaks of nature.

** Oh-My-God. Yes.

The Marcius Bloodline exists and was just forgotten someplace in the long lost past, harry ‘isn't' a member, but that's why all the magical governments exist, and have existed since Rome.

The Pyramids house the Blood Line trackers for all the magical bloodlines ever, and are why everyone isn't just related to everyone else.

America actually IS in control of a unified MCUSA.

The current magical rules and laws are built apon layer after layer of older and older laws and wards going back to the dawn of humanity (and the Elder Scrolls world). Side note: magical degradation or, The Atlantis Cascade is why the world isn't full of magic anymore, and the laylines are the reason it even exists at all anymore, (the laylines are powered by the literal elder scrolls).

The ICW is just the international body for Wizards and Witches. It's a sub groop of the ICM, (international conglomerate of magicals).

Magic as a whole is driven souly by Will and Intent, not ‘power' or ‘blood' or some such. It's just easier to do magic with wand and spell ‘cus that's what most of todays magicals believe, hence you don't need as much Will.

Oh, the Multiverse is a two stage thing. The Lesser Multiverse is for all HP-verse everywhere, there's another for Marvel and DC and Worm, Star Wars, LoTR and so on and so forth...

The Greater Multiverse is every fiction personified as reality, centered around the Hub, which if IRL earth.

There are Canon Worlds for all the canon as seen from the Hub, and divergent for everything else.

The Deathly Hollows actually ‘do' make people OP, though it varies for verse to verse.

The Philosopher Stone is NOT actually gone, and infact wasn't ever in Hogwarts at All.

Harry has Parseltounge* of his own accord, and not ‘cus of the Crux.

The muggle world knows about the magical, stleast in the higher government, and has been planning a slow reveal of it since the first commercial planes. It will likely become an open secret before the world is actually told about it.

Almost everything I can say about Daphne, Susan, Luna and plenty of other characters is entirely fanon. They weren't all that flushed out in canon.

And I feel like I could go on forever, but I'm going to stop there...

** Since wands choose the master, and not the other way around, I always thought if Neville had used another wand, from the start; and not his father's wand, he would have been a lot better with magic.

Similarly to Ron, if he had used a wand that had chosen him, his magic would have been a lot stronger from the beginning.

The Sorting Hat was created by magic that would be seen as dark magic by the Founders. But being back in the past; magic was seen as differently. (I see this as this way, because they were cautious about magical talking journals/hearing voices through the wall, et cetra. I don't know if this is in any stories; but this is my personal headcanon.

Different languages make spells stronger. If someone used Japanese or Spanish or something, the intent would be stronger, similarly Parseltongue makes magic in general stronger.

** every ark magic actually destroys a person's soul, humanity and mind and finally body.

Not always in this huge Voldemort-loses-his-nose-way, but in smaller unnoticed ways.It starts that you care less and less, become crueler. You feel different with time and even the purest emotions get tainted by it.

It is like carrying a bag with sand on your back with a tiny hole in it. With time the bag loses more and more sand and weight, but because it is so little at a time you don't notice it until it is too late.
