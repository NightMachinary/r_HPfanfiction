:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There was a fic where Harry accidentally brings a cleaning solution to life and it attacks professor Snape's hair and wanders the castle. And at one point it follows Dumbledore to the front hall. And I think at one point he makes a second one but it gets trapped or dies. And I'm pretty sure that isn't all the story or even a large plot point but it's the part I remember.

Help!?


** That sounds like Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions by wyste.
