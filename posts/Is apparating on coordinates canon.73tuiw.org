** I can't recall any time its done. That being said its nitpicking. We know that you need to know your destination and to focus on it. What do you need to know about the destination? Where it is relative to other places? What it looks like? I very much doubt there is a magical co-ordinates grid that filters your apparaition attempt and guides you but if the co-ordinates mean something to you then you might be able to fulfil the destination requirement. While giving me co-ordinates is useless if it became my wave of travelling then I'd probably start to know where places are. In the seventh book Harry and Hermione apparate to Godric's Hollow when neither has been there before (not counting baby Harry) so some way of travelling to somewhere new exists. Can you use photos perhaps? How do you know things haven't changed, you aren't going to apparate inside a wall or get impaled by some temporary scaffolding that wasn't there last time. Either apparition has some built in safety measures or its one of those things you just don't ask about. If coordinates were enough for you to understand your destination and you can picture where it is relative to other places then isn't that enough?

**** That sounds too practical for canon. HP magic is way more whimsical and useless at the same time.

** I assume there's something that can help you apparate to a location you've never been before. Example - Harry apparates to Shell Cottage just by thinking about the name. I'm sure Aurors and Obliviators are needed around the country often to places they haven't been before, so they must have some method of apparating.

*** I think in the wizarding world, names have some inherent magic to them (it's not just apparating that can go by name only; the floo specifically works that way). Plus we always hear that 'names have power' and you should be careful about who you tell your name to.

** This is a thing I wish JKR had gone more into detail about. I get that Apparating to a place you're familiar with such as your own home would be pretty easy, but new places seems very iffy. Like another poster said how do you avoid splinching yourself into a wall or through a fence? If you've read Robin Hobb's Assassin's Apprentice books, they have what they call "skill pillars" gifted users can use for traveling, but a lot of them have fallen into disrepair, making them dangerous to use. Some are underwater or fallen down on the ground--what happens if you try to Apparate to a spot that used to be high and dry but isn't anymore?

*** What happens if you apparate into a person? My headcanon is that apparition will take those things into account and if there's something there instead, it'll just place you right next to it.

**** Given the whole 'feeling like you're being squeezed out of a tube of toothpaste' feeling, I think Apparating works by opening a micro wormhole kind of aperture. The arriving wizard basically shoves aside whatever is in his way, like barreling through a doorway. This is somewhat supported in book 5 when the twins apparate onto Ron's bed. One of them says, 'It's harder to target in the dark' or something.

***** I agree. They likely apparated while standing up so you'd think their feet would get stuck in the bed, but they just land on top of it.

**** Right? Two-headed wizard? I guess the assumption is that the magic of Apparation would make any necessary adjustments, but there is so much that's unknown. It's a bit frustrating as a fan fiction writer.

** I think stuff like names, etc. is much more important than coordinates for magic. Though it may also depend on a caster mindset. If somebody is used to think in terms of coordinates then they will be helpful for him.

*** In other words, someone with an instinctive grasp of numbers and locations could Apparate on coordinates alone.

** Destination, Determination, Deliberation. Coordinates are not mentioned but you have to visualize your destination. This implies some sense of both visual appearance and memory, but also a location upon the earth (or a map). So it's not a giant reach to say that one could be given both a picture of a location and its coordinates and be able to apparate there (or perhaps coordinates alone).
