I read a Percy Jackson fic a while ago, where everything turns into an RPG games, with levels, skill points, quests, and all around goodness.

I'm curious to see if there are any fics similar to this, in the aspect that he is in a video game leveling up.

Here's the link to the fic if anyone wants to read it, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697391/1/Percy-Jackson-and-the-Game]]

** extremly hard to find decent gamer fic, they all either short abandoned or terribly written.
