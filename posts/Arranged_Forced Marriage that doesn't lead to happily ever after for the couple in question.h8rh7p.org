Where manipulative Dumbledore or Fudge or someone else makes out a 'betrothal' contract or somehow forces a similar situation that leads to Harry (or Fem!Harry) getting married to someone he can't stand or possibly hates with a passion and where it doesn't lead to an "and they eventually fell in love despite everything and everything was okay after all!" ending.

Where Harry rages against those that tried to turn him into a housewife/slave/whore/whatever and fights for his independence against all odds.


** First one that sprang to mind is this tragedy, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10027124/1/Playmate][/Playmates/]].

It's not a happily ever after story at all.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/425266][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]] is pretty much the poster fic for this category. They overthrew the government and *executed anyone who supported that marriage law*. And that's only the beginning...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5201691/1/Marriage-in-Mind][Marriage in Mind]], linkffn(5201691), is far less violent, but Harry threatens psychological torture to get the other side to back off.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation][Contractual Invalidation]], linkffn(11697407), deals with the betrothal contract in a unique way. This Harry neither likes nor hates it, but cleverly manipulates the other side to advance his career and agenda.

  After Voldemort's defeat, and in order to keep control of Harry Dumbledore enacts a marriage contract between Harry and Ginny. Bound by Pureblood Traditions, Harry can only use that to his advantage. Not a Harry/Ginny fic. Pre Slash.
