** linkffn(Unatoned by SeriousScribble) is Harry Potter mystery noir that could have been published in pulp magazines with Raymond Chandler stories. The first chapter itself is an homage to the first chapter (basically scene for scene) of Raymond Chandler's famous story /The Big Sleep/ and the movie based off it (starring Humphrey "No One Other Than Clark Gable Looked As Good In A Fedora As I Did" Bogart).

** How long is the ideal chapter for you? Because some authors I've read will do 5k+ words in a chapter, while others barely hit 1k, so that's a /big/ length difference.
