Specifically im looking for a fic where an intelligent harry (a harry that knows more spells than in cannon) is thrown into a world where there is no magic, and he doesn't try to hide his magic.

I really really hate those fics where he is the only magic user, but still hides his magic..

Fics can be standard or crossovers, as long as harry is the only magic user and uses his magic openly. -no problem if 1-2 people travel with him to the new world/universe/reality-

No slash please


** The story is called "stranded" its an xover with the arrow in which harry lands on the island with Sara whom switches places with oliver. Its really interesting I'm still trying to finish it but harry doesn't use the spells often because of a plot twist that you'll have to find out but other than that he doesn't hide it and openly tries to use it.

*** One other thing is that that is also the universe for the flash so superpowers r there but harry is the only one to use magic as far as I've gotten.

** Wand and Shield by Morta's Priest 

It's not exactly nonmagical but there's no Harry Potter Univese type magic in the Avengers Universe before Harry's arrival.

** "Havoc side of the Force" kinda qualifies. Magic and the Force do NOT get along. While he's not hiding his magical talent, he's not flaunting it either. (By which I mean he's not in everyone's face about his magical skills. Someone figures out he can teleport, he won't wipe their minds or deny it)

Sorry for no link, I'm on my phone

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6457720/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Alien-Reality][I know something that's almost word for word what you asked for.]]

He's sent to the world he is in because it has no magic and going back would need a lot iirc, literally everyone of even minor consequence in the story knows he's magical, and Harry qualifies your definition of intelligent (He knows everything Voldemort knew prior to 1981.)

It's a HP/Stargate SG-1 crossover, I'm pretty sure you don't need Stargate knowledge since I have none, but the author explicitly states he expects some. So here's an intro, a few governments found gates built by some ancient alien civilization on earth that can travel to any other gate instantly, doesn't matter where they are, most of them are on random planets across the universe.
