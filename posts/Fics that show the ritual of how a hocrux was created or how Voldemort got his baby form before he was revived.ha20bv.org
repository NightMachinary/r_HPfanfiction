I know that Jk says in an interview that the rituals in the title were so horrible that she couldn't print them (and I'm taking this an canon bc I'm pretty sure it was early times, and even if it wasn't its not dumblegay level so I'm assuming it's an accepted fact??) Anways fics that explore this?

Edit: for anyone interested, I was wondering about this because I was listening to the Potterless podcast, where there's a theory that Bertha Jonkins was pregnant or something and Voldemort possessed her baby, or maybe another baby.


** The Accidental Animagus briefly describes the homunculus creation in chapter 73 ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/73/]]). Nothing too extraordinary, although it did involve extracting a womb from a random passerby.

Enter the Dragon describes Horcrux creation as a perversion of a soul-bonding marriage ritual; the caster murders the "spouse" before the bond can settle, and transfers it to an object instead.

** Fate has a rather grotesque description of how baby form was made. I know I made a comment about it on a deleted account a while back

If you scroll a little, find the post about how the making of horcruxes should be yuckier, you'll find it.

** My fic is a rather embarrassing crossover between Raven from Teen Titans and HP, but I do show a graphic Dark ritual to form a Horcrux (basically Voldemort offers Raven to make one for her to separate her father Trigon's soul from hers) and I tried to make it as disturbing as possible while still being suitable for merely an M rating.

The rest of the story isn't my best writing, but if anyone wants to just read that chapter, it's here: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3044060/26/][Wildcard - Ch 26]]
