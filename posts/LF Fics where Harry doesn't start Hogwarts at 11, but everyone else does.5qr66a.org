Maybe the letters couldn't find him or he was in another dimension, whatever the case, Harry starts Hogwarts late.

Slash, bashing, dark!harry and crossovers are okay. No harems, romance/smut-driven plot, genderbending, mpreg or pottercest. Thank you!

#+begin_quote
  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

*** I finished this earlier today, do you have any other similar recommendations to something like this? Where Harry primarily stays in the muggle world? I never knew how content I was with reading a fic where Voldemort wasn't the end game, I was actually laughing cause I kept thinking all of a sudden Harry would defeat Voldemort with his woodworking skills.
