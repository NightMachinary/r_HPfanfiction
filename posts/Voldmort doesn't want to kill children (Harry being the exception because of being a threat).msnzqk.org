Not out of the goodness of his heart but past experience showed him that people have a soft spot for kids. When he slaughtered Edgar Bones' entire family, including his children, he lost a lot of support from blood purists such as the Blacks. That's why he doesn't kill the child at Godric's Hallow who confuses his appearance with a Halloween costume. That's why he gives an ultimatum to the Hogwarts resistance so that they have time to evacuate the children... he knows that Death Eaters won't put their heart in the fight if they know their kids are in danger. Even though he acts cruelly towards Lucius, he stops the fight partly to keep Draco safe and partly because he learns that a bunch of kids, including Colin Creevey, who have snuck back into the school have been killed. He finds Fenrir who attacks children disgusting and that's why he doesn't get accepted in his inner circle despite his effectiveness.

Also if you know of fics where Voldemort is struggling with moral conundrums even if it's for the sake of maintaining his followers' support, I would gladly appreciate any recommendation.

Edit: I know it's spelled Voldemort but I can't edit post titles.


** There was this fic where bellatrix has a child with voldemort when he doesn't die in the battle of hogwarts, to tie him into a relationship with someone and make him sane. Its a pretty good fic showing how V would act if he had someone to protect. I don't remember the name, unfortunately.

** The Perfectly Normal series has a reasonable Voldemort, who >! Decides that the prophecy was fulfilled when Harry defeated him as a child, and that unless Harry acts against him, they're even. He tells his followers that he's already destroyed Harry's life and will kill any of them who attack harry !<

** Harry Potter and the secret of the Vipers comes to mind.

Here, Voldemort is much more smarter and is portrayed as a revolutionary that is willing to get his hands dirty but still cares about the betterment of the magical society.

From attacking government shipments with magical ingredients to show the people that their lives depend too much on the magical government to normal politics, he is a far more dangerous enemy when he knows when to duke it out and when to talk.

And he is far too interested in Harry and really wants him to join him, which is why he has done Harry some favors I will not spoil here. Harry is conflicted because he agrees with Voldemort's ideas but doesn't agree with how he operates.

It was updated back in January 2021, I haven't seen any news.
