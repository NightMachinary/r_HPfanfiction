** Generally I stay clear from self-insert fics from any fanfiction, my experiences with them usually end in frustration or disgust and most of them are rather.. well, just terrible. Though, everyone's tastes are different so maybe you'll find something you'll like by combing through previous requests, or post an example of a fic you like so others can maybe find something that's similar to what you're looking for.

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

** Linkao3(rose petal red by NonchalantxFish) Is a really good one. It was a bit hard to read for me at the begging , because of the authorâ€˜s...peculiar writing style. And naturally the main character is OP, but it didn't bother me like it usually does. Also, her relationship with her family is very well portrayed. It updates regularly.

  I'm a little upset with the creativity of my and my twin's names. I get that it's because our father's name is Arthur, and I was an unexpected --- though pleasant --- surprise. But Guinevere is just the English version of Ginevra! That's so- Wait. What do I even care about that? I'm the eighth Weasley. In the Harry Potter universe. Ginny is my twin sister. Oh god. (Well, at least magic is super cool. Right?)

** Sir Lucifer Morningstar makes pretty good OC inserts, although they're not self inserts unless he himself is actually that ruthless. His stuff is pretty dark though so be careful of the edge.

** It's finished and short but Young Offender is very good. While the Authors laptop broke and he finished the story by telling the reader what would of happened. It is easily in my top 5 because the story is unique and has a modern twist. Young Offender by Tydbox is what fan fiction should be, funny and thrilling. Also listen to the recommended songs as they help. Hopefully his new story A.D.H.D can be better.
