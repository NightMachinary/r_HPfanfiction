** Controversially I really love Snape/ Harry.\\
There are many reasons for this, and I am sure someone could articulate it better.\\
- I think they have similar childhoods and would be more understanding of each other's difficulties\\
- Snape is such a deep and complex character, it is interesting to read how so many different people can interpret him.\\
- After the war (where he never died thank you very much!) You'd have to wonder how that would change his personality. Is he still the same bastard who is mean and cruel, does he grow and apologise? Does he become a recluse and only have tea with Minerva once a year?

** Ooh. I have a few. Harry/Charlie, Sirius/Remus, and Harry/Tom. I just love the idea of Harry getting along with a teenage Tom Riddle because they're so similar but also different. Sirius and Remus are pretty obvious since they're the only two left but also some other reasons that I can't think up right now. And I just love the idea of Harry being with Charlie. Maybe because he's older and physically looks stronger than Harry, because he hangs around dragons, or because of something else. I don't know. I just love the idea of them together. Drarry's also a little bittersweet and I love it. So much hurt and pain but also so much eventual happiness.
