:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Been going crazy trying to key in search terms in google, but going nowhere!

From what I remember of the fic: Harry (who may or may not be female in this Idk) found his ancestor's journal and it writes of Loki who at some point helped the Wizarding World by erasing the memory of their being from the rest of the world. But Odín messed up Loki's ritual by erasing a few runes and it's part of the reason he's messed up now because Loki is convinced that he didn't act to protect the wizards and hates all non-magical now.

Any help would be appreciated!


** I just read this! It's Holly Potter and the Midlife Crisis.

  “The first group I sent over made the Avengers uncomfortable by thanking them constantly and asking for autographs. The next group stole things to sell on ebay. The group after that didn't even get through the front door because Stark's security system found something in their background that we missed. The fourth group left traumatized after cleaning out Thor's room, apparently the god had some beheaded poultry dripping blood into a bowl in there. Then after that every group I've left hasn't lasted more than three days because of some problem or another. I'm pretty sure one of those assholes has made it a game to scare my workers away.”“I don't think you're supposed to call the heroes of New York assholes.”Or, cleaning up after the Avengers involves more than just getting blood stains out of the carpet and most of them can't take the heat. Thankfully the Savior of the Wizarding has spent the last decade cleaning up after Death Eaters, so she's up to the task. Nothing, not pranks, bird corpses, or unidentified slime will keep her from cleaning up.
