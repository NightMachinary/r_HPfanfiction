*** Also readers should keep in mind that it was before the series was actually finished. So we legitimately didn't know things like where Snape's loyalties actually lied, which obviously plays into the portrayal of him.

** Wow. It's been years since I've read it. Honestly one of the first great fanfics that I read. Also what got me into Time Travels.

Glad we're getting content this year probably. Having one of the great stories resurrect is most welcome.

**** linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches; Revenge is Best Served Raw)is generally good, very heavy AU though. One of the better currently updating ones. Harry Travels back in time and creates a persona of Lord Slytherin, plays at politics and other stuff. WBWL.

Another is linkffn(I'm Still Here) and linkffn(What's a Little Death Between Friends?), both by Kathryn518, though both haven't been updated in quite a while. First is a dimension travel following Voldemort, to the GoF year. Cross Dimension with living Potters and a female Ravenclaw Harry.

linkffn(Realignment) is quite nice, though it is very different from almost all time travel fics I've read in HP, thankfully complete. MoD Harry becomes a dark lord, travels back to Grindelwald era to kill Tom, Dumbleldore protects Tom. Explores the world quite well.

linkffn(On a Pale Horse) is quite amusing, in that it trivializes everything while cackling (also dead). Harry is Death, going to a parallel universe by being summoned. Close enough.

linkffn(Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth) Is is a reincarnation time travel, as a 3rd (but 1st) Black family brother, MoD, Complete. Ignore the part about a sequel, it will probably never be updated.

linkffn(Oh God Not Again) is a crack fic, Harry and one other gets shunted back to the start of Hogwarts, and pretty much nothing changes except it deals with a Harry treating everything in an entirely non serious manner,

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Trouble With Sorting Hats) is a oneshot, mainly the Sorting Hat immediately rats Harry out.

linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute) is Harry traveling back in time the day of the 3rd task, and having twelve hours to defeat Voldemort and destroy all Horecruxes.

linkffn(Wind Shear) is decent, Harry back to the time when Death Eaters were just starting up. Very much able to deal with stuff. Theoretical Bellatrix pairing, but it's mostly her pining for him in some little things until the epilogue. Complete.

linkffn(Stepping Back) is similar to the above, except further forward in time, and stuff happens. Harder to describe it. He has more support from Dumbledore, the Ministry, and friends. Still updating.

linkffn(The Unwinding Golden Thread) is Harry accidentally in Tom's Hogwarts, and Harry tries to get Grindelwald's rise stopped. Of course, time travel isn't something so easily manipulated, and things go wrong. Complete.

linkffn(With Love, Harry) is Harry going back and adopting Tom, and insisting that he's /obviously/ a male wood nymph. Non-serious tone, but I am amused by it. He also keeps accidentally grabbing the Elder Wand. It's gotten up to chapter 11, but currently only edited and reuploaded to chapter 8.

linkffn(October by The Carnivorous Muffin) is death Harry going back to Tom's Hogwarts for lack of anything else to do. He speaks in bad poetry. He also changes a rather significant amount of things. The author also has quite a few side stories. Still updating.

linkffn(The Last Peverell) is a time travel (for the 9th time?) back because MoD stuff, trying to get the magical world not to self destruct. Now back at Marauders era Hogwarts for the first time. Also Harry is female and in the body of a Peverell. Still updating.

linkffn(Unspeakables by Ebenbild) is Harry and Percy back in time, with assumed/mistaken identities, and obviously both unspeakables. Updating occasionally.

linkffn(Full Circle) is the only slash story I actually like. Harry and Tom both keep getting reborn together and finding each other in their lives. They are now back at their first lives. And the most recent chapter introduced the main antagonist which has been hinted at. Still updating.

linkffn(Retrograde) is Harry going back to Amelia Bones' time in Hogwarts after the dementor attack. He also tries to stop Voldemort in his twenties, which launches him back forward. Still updating. Good author in general.

linkffn(Far Too Many Time Travelers). I haven't read it myself, but it's a parody of everybody being time travelers. Updating.

linkffn(Carpe Noctem), Tom is shoved back toward his sixth year after dying. He is displeased with this, and has his sanity again. Still undoubtedly a dark lord. Currently early stages of travel back, a bit of time probing. Dumbledore pretty much immediately notices he's a dark lord. Good, still updating.

linkffn(Phantasy) is Harry needing to keep going back in time, bringing two with herself each time, to try and stop the magical world from being destroyed. She aims to do this by raising Atlantis. She decided to Bring Riddle and Grindlewald this time. Looks to be dead, though the author isn't.

linkffn(From the Ashes by Leonhard van Euler), Dumbledore goes back in time not of his own will, and as a seven year old Harry. He isn't the only one. Still updates sometimes.

There's a few cross dimensional ones I also quite like that I didn't list above, linkffn(Stages of Hope) and linkffn(Dimension Hopping for Beginners), linkffn(Across the Universe), linkffn(A Fearful Redux), linkffn(crawlersout), linkffn(0800-Rent-A-Hero). All decent, but more dimension travel than time in my book.

I promise nothing about how well the links will work. All of them are worth a try, and are generally pretty decent at least. Hope this helps a bit. Apologies for the sheer number of stories, this is me pretty much dumping all of them I kept on my favorites list.

  A mild send-up on a popular genre of Harry Potter fanfiction. As much as I enjoy them, some practical considerations come to mind. Inevitably, Harry has one specific ally in all those fics ... but what if that entity took a different view on things?

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

I promise nothing about how well the links will work. All of them are worth a try, and are generally pretty decent at least. Hope this helps a bit. Apologies for the sheer number of stories, this is me pretty much dumping all of them I kept on my favorites list.

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding?

**** Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass is one of (if not my absolute) favorite fic. linkffn(12188150).

Although it is only a 1 year time travel, which means it departs pretty far from your 'average' time travel fic. It more serves as an excuse to get Tonks impersonating a 5th year rather than really doing much with time travel.

Good time travel fics where time travel is central... A Little Child Shall Lead Them is probably the best (linkffn(10871795)). Hermione goes back in time to when she was a baby and baby-hermione proceeds with a no-nonsense takedown of the timeline.

​

Also recently read "Teddy's Excellent Adventure" which is... hilarious. 6-year old Teddy decides to go back in time and get his adopted father together with his biological mother. linkffn(13021745)

*** The author's summary is decent.

"The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?"

I'll add that while Harry does use his foreknowledge to get a head start on fighting Voldemort, a lot of the story has been focused on rebuilding his friendships on a firmer foundation than the first time and training people to survive the coming war. The reason he went back to try again was because he'd lost everyone, and saving them remains his motivation throughout his second chance at life.

In my opinion, this focus is a strength of the story, neatly bypassing the issue of creating a boring overpowered hero. Watching Neville bloom much earlier, and seeing Ginny as a fully fleshed-out character who's included from day 1, is never boring.

O ye of little faith!

The strength of NoFP, in my opinion, is that it focuses on Harry's relationships. Sure, he has much more magical knowledge, skill and power than he should, but that's only occasionally relevant. The real story is how he tries to be a better friend this time around, to help his loved ones with their problems and guide them to reach their potential - and prepare them to survive the war on their horizon. By doing that, NoFP tells a compelling story regardless of how easy or difficult it may be to fight Voldemort.
