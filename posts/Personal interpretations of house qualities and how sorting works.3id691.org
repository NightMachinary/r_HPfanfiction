I've been thinking about the houses and what they really mean. Now obviously we have canon information regarding this, but everybody has their own interpretation of it.

I have some of my own thoughts, of course. For example, I see a division between the more "pragmatic" houses (Slytherin and Hufflepuff, IMO) and the more "abstract" houses (Ravenclaw and Gryffindor), but then in other ways, Slytherin and Gryffindor are more similar. There's also questions I have about how accurate the sorting songs really are (Slytherin only takes the purest of blood, except that's not true, right? And is Hufflepuff the house for the most loyal and hardworking or is it the house for "the rest"?)

But I'm actually more interested in what you think! What is your personal interpretation of what the houses truly mean? What are some fics that portray this in a way you agree with, and why? How can somebody fit a house while not being a perfect stereotype of that house ('cause we know there's more than four types of people in the world)? If you're a writer, how and to what extent do you incorporate your personal understanding of the houses into your characterization and writing?

P.S. I tried to search for a similar thread and couldn't find one, but feel free to point me to one I might have missed. Apologies if this has already been discussed ad nauseam.

*** I like your thoughts! And I agree that both Slytherins and Hufflepuffs seem to be characterized by loyalty.

For me, the similarities between Gryffindor and Ravenclaw come down to a much more abstract, and possibly idealistic (particularly in the case of Gryffindors), view of the world.

After I posted this, I was thinking about why I said that Slytherin and Gryffindor have a lot in common, and I thought of a way to describe the houses on sort of an XY axis. In this view, Gryffindor is abstract/active, Ravenclaw is abstract/reactive, Slytherin is pragmatic/active, and Hufflepuff is pragmatic/reactive. Any thoughts? Is this too simplistic, or is it a good basic structure?

**** Hmm yes, I'd agree that the Ravenclaws generally have their head in the clouds and are thinking of the world in a more abstract sense because they distance themselves from it when they study it. Gryffindors have the same mindset, but more because they may view it through their ideals instead of what it actually is and so see it through Rose Colored glasses.

*** posted this in another thread earlier, but i'll just write a shortened version --

the traits that seem to be characterized in each house are as follows:

gryffindor - courage

ravenclaw - drive for knowledge

slytherin - ambition

hufflepuff - loyalty (to their own); hard work

Gryffindors having the unique trait of being able to face and overcome their fears, and deal with ambiguity.

Ravenclaws are driven by a desire for knowledge in itself.

Slytherins are characterized by their ambition, and may desire knowledge, have courage, and are loyal, but in the sense that those traits help them achieve their ambition.

Hufflepuffs are hard working. They believe in the power of practice, and are loyal to those who they have bonds with. (ie cedric > harry)

I think the Sorting Hat sorts based off which house you want to be in first, and only if you don't have preconceptions of which house you want to be in does it sort you according to your character at the time. I also don't really understand why you think Slytherins are inherently loyal. I find their loyalty to their families stems from a shared environment and a shared viewpoint of superiority, and only reaches that far (see sirius/regulus*/narcissa/bellatrix/andromeda).

**** That might be so, but if you want to know why a lot of people associate Slytherin with loyalty, it's probably that many of the Slytherins in the series have loyalty as one of their primary traits, and often one of their only sympathetic ones.

I would disagree that their loyalty always ultimately comes down to a "shared viewpoint of superiority" because we repeatedly see Slytherins casting aside these beliefs as soon as they conflict with their personal loyalties. Not necessarily stopping believing them, but choosing a personal loyalty over them.

For example: Regulus (not Reginald, btw) chose his loyalty to Kreacher over the Death Eaters and the values he was raised with. Snape chose his loyalty to Lily in much the same way (though you might say too little, too late). Narcissa (and Lucius also to a degree) chose their loyalty to their son over everything, and from the 6th book on, nearly EVERYTHING Draco does is motivated by loyalty towards his parents. We also know from extra-canon information from JKR that Draco stopped believing in pureblood superiority in his later life, but remains very loyal to his parents despite disagreeing with them.

These are really significant parts of each of these characters, and they're some of the most prominent Slytherins in the series. So you may not agree that this can be expanded to the entire house, but that's basically why a lot of people do associate Slytherins with loyalty.

  The events of Draco's late teens forever changed his life. He had had the beliefs with which he had grown up challenged in the most frightening way: he had experienced terror and despair, seen his parents suffer for their allegiance, and had witnessed the crumbling of all that his family had believed in. People whom Draco had been raised, or else had learned, to hate, such as Dumbledore, had offered him help and kindness, and Harry Potter had given him his life. After the events of the second wizarding war, Lucius found his son as affectionate as ever, but refusing to follow the same old pure-blood line.

  Draco married the younger sister of a fellow Slytherin. Astoria Greengrass, who had gone through a similar (though less violent and frightening) conversion from pure-blood ideals to a more tolerant life view, was felt by Narcissa and Lucius to be something of a disappointment as a daughter-in-law. They had had high hopes of a girl whose family featured on the ‘Sacred Twenty-Eight', but as Astoria refused to raise their grandson Scorpius in the belief that Muggles were scum, family gatherings were often fraught with tension.

****** Well I made a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3bfd35/is_there_any_evidence_of_slytherin_solidarity_in/cslp0na][comment,]] which goes into the canon which shows the Slytherin 'solidarity', when that came up.

Now loyalty isn't the exact same but they share a lot. Sometimes I think it may come down to where you stand, and how you judge. ex. Sirius betrays his family as they see it for a school friend (and a werewolf) , Weasleys betray their sacred twenty-eight and pureblood fellows. Clearly they show a great loyalty to a greater cause but that does mean turning your back on something else. Just because we are not on their side I think it is easy to condemn them for similar things. I wouldn't call Vader a backstabbing traitor- he's a bad ass and saved his son. But Lucius and Narcissa usually are seen as such, despite making the right choice in the end (even if as a last nearly forced measure). Pettigrew is a traitor through and through- probably the worst and is a Gryffindor, Bellatrix shows fanatical loyalty and that is condemned but that doesn't stop it being loyalty. As pointed out in my old comment Gryffindors by and large do not stick together or show a uniform front/loyalty to one another and their house. I think Slytherins get deemed disloyal snakes because honestly, in the cases we see it, they do it so well. Snape betrays the fuck out of Voldemort bringing about his demise. Narcissa betrays the fuck out of Voldemort and helps bring about his demise. Regulus betrays the fuck out of Voldemort and helps bring about his demise. However they don't just backstab one another routinely, they do it for their ambitious goals. Again it often is seen as a grey area but they did choose 'love'/friendship/good, family, and righting a wrong respectively- each showing loyalty to something better in turn.

Finally one thing I forgot to mention I see in my original comment was that all the Slytherins are sent away in the final battle. Clearly they aren't all guilty and I don't think were being condemned completely so much as McGonagall knew that whatever else they stuck together against the rest. (which honestly I think McGonagall would love to see in her own house) I fell like I signed up for that debate thread :P but I really don't mean to debate but I just see things differently (and may very well have forgot obvious cases which show the opposite).

ps. to non-edit I also missed Regulus not just righting a wrong but effectively choosing the inter-species ?love,respect,friendship? of a slave over his pureblood family/death eater ideals. Which in the DH discussion it was pointed out that wizards routinely alter the mind of muggles with no compunction, and we know how even the good guys generally regard other magical creatures.

** Then again...

I'm reminded of a thread a while back where [[/u/Taure][u/Taure]] pointed out that the Sorting Hat 'sorts the students as they would have been in the Founder's time'... which gives the impression that they were going to divide the newcomers evenly, like picking teams for kickball.

In such a situation the Hat may already know where the stronger personalities are likely to go as they enter and only modifies his split if one of them reveals a hidden side. After that the students grow to act like members of their House based upon how the House treats its members.

** I answered a question about differences between Slytherins and Ravenclaws before like this:

#+begin_quote
  I think it's important to focus on motivations, the values that drive a person forward, rather than every trait the Sorting Hat spits out. Intelligence, wit, and cunning don't describe why someone does something; they're more like consequences of their motivations.

  Slytherins' primary motivation is ambition, very self-focused. They want to push themselves as far as they can and think highly of their own worth. Many become intelligent and cunning in order to achieve that. I see intelligence as a tool for them, and the smarter they are, the more successful and respected they tend to be---so not everyone is necessarily intelligent, like in Goyle's case.

  Ravenclaws, on the other hand, are motivated by knowledge. They want to expand their mind, and intelligence is often the result. They think highly of what they know, respect people who can converse on the same level as them, and have little patience for things they consider trivial. Luna's a perfect example---very wrapped up in her family's philosophies and happy to share her wisdom, and while open-minded, never strays too far from her beliefs.

  I can see how Ravenclaw and Slytherin are similar. Their values are both more self-focused, unlike Gryffindor and Hufflepuff, whose values focus on people as a whole. Which doesn't make Ravenclaws and Slytherins inherently selfish, just like how sacrifice isn't inherently noble, because sometimes you can do most by improving yourself and/or being alive. They all have traits that can be potentially good or bad!

Slytherin seems isolated, whether by choice or forced, it's stupid that one house was meant to be the evil house, when they are kids.....granted that the did house a buddying psychopath, but all houses have had bad eggs.

** Hm, so let's see. For what it's worth, I agree with others in the sense that the SH sends you to a house based on what you value, rather than what you necessarily embody. So whether someone goes to Hufflepuff or Slytherin can depend on what type of go-getter they are - does he want to set and achieve lofty goals for himself, or does he just get it done? The first would probably end up in Slytherin, the second probably in Hufflepuff. In a similar vein, Hermione ends up a Gryffindor because although she's a bookworm, she values courage and bravery more than just acquiring knowledge (not to mention that I personally feel like Hermione expected everyone to want to acquire knowledge).

One other way to explain this might be to say that every person has all of the traits of the houses, and it's how they intersect for that particular person that makes the difference. Like the example I gave above, a person who is a hard worker may be a Slytherin because all of that hard work is focused on and secondary to achieving very specific goals - it's not that the hard work isn't necessary, it's just that it's merely a gateway to the primary objective. Hogwarts Houses Divided actually does a good job of showcasing that. I also think Innocent does a good job of this, in showing that Slytherins and Gryffindors will often take the same actions, but for different reasons.

And, I can't help but toss it out here - Forging the Sword also does a good job of exposing little insights about the houses here and there.

Edit: Oh, I also thought that Finding Himself was pretty interesting in tackling and dismantling what it means for "Hufflepuff to take all the rest." I do want to note that, with the exception of Hogwarts Houses Divided, none of these fics (and most IME) are not super focused on the interpretations of houses as a whole, just one particular house, usually.

***** Harry was cunning in the first few books, before Rowling decided to hand him the idiot ball full time. Remember, he's the one that actually figured out the Philosopher's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, and did lots of sneaking around or manipulating authority figures. It's really a shame she changed him, because a Harry that defeats Voldemort through cunning is a much more satisfying character than a Harry that defeats him through pure luck or even raw power.

***** Harry is a bad example in general, because as far as characters go he's really close to being a blank slate, so his lack of cunning isn't about not being cunning but rather about dealing with people who push him away from it. Because really, everything in his life, everything, comes from other people. He's a wizard because other people called him a wizard, he's a hero because other people tell him he is a hero, he is a boy because other people tell him he is a boy, and so on, and so on; had someone glued an artificial cat tail and cat ears to him when he was sleeping and then told him that he is half-human, half-cat, I wouldn't be surprised if he believed that too.

But there are moments when he shows that he has a brain and can use it to be cunning. They are just rare and not very noticeable.

*** Yeah, I've definitely seen people talk about that, and it makes a lot of sense. Especially when you look at somebody like, say, Goyle. Not particularly cunning, no sign of personal ambition as far as I can see, but he agrees with the Slytherin values. Or Dumbledore - sure, he's hardly a coward, but he's also brilliant and very interested in pursuing knowledge, as well as ambitious and cunning. But he clearly puts the highest value on bravery. So yeah, I think values have to be an important factor in sorting.

And yeah, you're probably right about Hermione! She's shocked that everybody else didn't memorize the textbooks. I think she has a point, though. If, at 11, I'd found out a magical world existed and I was part of it, I would have devoured everything I could find on it! It's bizarre how uninterested some of the Muggle-raised kids are.

** I've been paring and parsing this question for a while. This is my pithy summary (so far):

- Gryffindors want to be noticed- they value popularity and seek approval.
- Hufflepuffs want to be included- they value acceptance and seek to do their part.
- Ravenclaws want to be right- they value having the answers, even if they don't share them, and thus seek special cases.
- Slytherins want to be in control- they value influence and seek advantages.

Harry hates his fame and does nothing to encourage or cultivate his popularity (if anything, he avoids it as much as possible), McGonagall seems more concerned about doing what she thinks is right than whether people like her, and I think Neville would definitely more accurately fit as a Hufflepuff than a Gryffindor in your categories.

**** I was thinking of Neville and of Wormtail when I wrote this- it's not that they want to be popular but that they value it in others. Even the word popularity is a bit off-target; it's more a matter of regard. A Gryffindor values those who command attention by force of personality. They value conviction and certainty.

Still, it's a valid argument that Neville would rather have just done his part and been included, but he also stood against stronger personalities when their intentions ran against his own principles. 'You guys should stay in the dorm and not make things worse' was prompted from the same compulsion as 'Kneeling to you, Lord Voldemort, is not what anyone should do.'

As for Harry not valuing popularity, he was happy to be a Quidditch star because he'd earned it, rather than inheriting it from the actions of his parents. Most of his popularity was based on lies, from his perspective. He stood up for the things he believed, trying to prove himself as worthy on his own merits. It's still a value system based on the approval of society... in a way.

As I said, it's a work in progress...

I like that idea, because really everyone can be brave or loyal or smart or cunning. The biggest difference is who you are around, what values you strive for and try to embody, and the political implications of each house. The idea that the house a child is in shapes who they are, and the Hat can see those possibilities and choose which is the best for the child, is one I really like.

** Firstly I don't think the sorting hat can read your mind, I think it subtly asks questions and sees how you respond, not how you'd chose to answer. So its basically a questionnaire, but this is combined with some parameters. It takes into count peoples opinions on what house they want, since most people fit nicely into multiple houses. It tends to sort muggleborns away from Slytherin, and it tries to balance the houses out, which works because people fit multiple places.

The adventurous sorts go to Gryffindore, the deceptive sort go to Slytherin, Ravenclaw is for people who prize knowledge, and Hufflepuff is an open house. I think the loyalty/hardworking is just what is nurtured in that environment.

Yes, Hufflepuff /is/ the House for all of those who don't fit into any of the Houses. But that's not necessarily bad, it means it has a wide variety of people with unique and rare traits.

Gryffindor and Hufflepuff share the trait of caring more for others than yourself (this is stereotypically speaking, of course). Gryffindor and Slytherin share the trait of desiring to be the best there is, to stand above everybody else, to have a superiority complex. Slytherin and Ravenclaw share the trait of making lots (and often too many) plans before acting. Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff share the trait of preferring to stay out of fights (I guess? This is the most difficult one to find a similarity).

But as you see, they share traits with oneanother. There are many more but that would take /forever/ to list out.

**** Good point.

I can't really say for myself why I chose Slytherin. Let's go from house to house for this:

Gryffindor: I'm not brave, and I have no problem with that. Frankly, I feel like a Gryffindor acts before he thinks. Example: Harry going to the ministry to save Sirius. Then there's the fact that Gryffindors are true friends in general. I'm not. I don't even feel the need to have a friend (as for why that is, well, that's a long story).

Huffelpuff: loyal and a good friend. I've already given my thoughts on that. Hardworking? Only if I see a good reason to work hard for something (mostly those reasons are entirely selfish, not very Huffelpuff).

Ravenclaw: I'd say I'm pretty smart and I have a drive for knowledge. But I'm horrible with riddles, so I won't even be able to enter the common room if I wanted to.

Slytherin: I'm not the most cunning person you'll meet. I can't tell a lie to save my life. Avoiding lying is much better, though. Ambition? Only if I see a good reason to be so.

So there you have it. Hard to choose. I felt like a Ravenclaw when I was younger, but in the end, I chose Slytherin on a gut feeling. Ironic, I know. But I feel good about it.
