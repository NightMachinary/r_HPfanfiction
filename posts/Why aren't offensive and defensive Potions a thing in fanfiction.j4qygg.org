In canon, Potions explode accidentally, in Potions class. A dedicated team of researchers and Potions Masters could come up with a battery of potions that do so deliberately (and far more effectively); such would be quite a useful resource for Aurors (and beleaguered Boys-Who-Lived and Co.). So too would a Potion that provides Defensive benefits; for example, one which causes any non-living surface (including clothes) to grow a layer of metal armor, which would absorb most kinds of spellfire.

Why don't we see this concept in fanfiction, like, at all?


** I think that, in Harry Potter, Potions are often "less usefull" than spells, especially in a combat setting, and this for several reasons:

- *Creating a new potions is long and expensive:*\\
  Creating a new spell is probably just as hard as creating a new potion, but Spellmaker don't have to pay for all the ingredients used in their experience, making the whole process a lot more affordable, both for the Ministry and the private researcher.
- *Potions are only consummables:*\\
  A potion can only be used once while a spell can be used forever. For someone like an Auror, learning the spell equivalent of a Potion (like a shield Charm, to use your example) would mean he would be more safe during a fight (since he would not be limited by his supply limit), and cost a lot more on the Ministry since he would not use expensives potions during his fights.
- *Potions are dangerous to use:*\\
  A potion vial can't be hit by anything from an enemy curse to some debris and randomly explode, killing the user. An unused spell doesn't exist and is completely safe.

â€‹

In my opinion, the true strenght lies in 2 things:

- Its ability to create some effect inimitable by Spells (the Wolfbane helping a werewolf keep his mind during the full moon, the Veritaserum forcing someone to tell the truth . . .).
- Its ability to let people do something they would otherwise be unable to (only a Master in Transfiguration would be able to change his appearance to copy the identity of someone else, but thanks to potion the Trio could do it in 2nd year).

And none of these strenght would translate well in combat (if you have the ability to send a rookie into battle with a bag full of potion, just use these funds to recruit a skilled wizard and send him into battle).

** /Avery had moved forward to get a better look at the pitiful boy. On his third step, he put his foot down on some freshly dug earth. Freshly dug earth concealing a muggle mechanism, transferring the pressure of his step directly onto a double volume of a potion mixture Harry had prepared earlier.../

/Since Harry was already lying on the ground, he was relatively protected from the massive explosion that rocked the clearing. Avery had indeed followed normal protocol when stepping on a mine, which was to leap twenty feet in the air and scatter oneself over a wide area./

/At least six of Voldemort's nearby minions were killed instantly by the blast, which stunned the rest./

/What they, or Harry for that matter, didn't expect, was the shockwave traveling through the ground managed to set off the other half dozen potion mines hidden around the clearing./

/Harry covered his head with his arms for almost a minute before the soil landing on him stopped falling. In that time the pain in his scar pushed the fog away and he had recovered his wits. He managed to stand by holding his weight entirely on his left leg./

/The scene resembled nothing short of a battlefield; seven large holes in a forest clearing, surrounded by robed bodies. The ringing in his ears rendered him effectively deaf, but Harry felt a surge of triumph./

/Until the bodies started to move. Though less than one in three of Harry's attackers were struggling to rise, he was still outnumbered by more than twenty-to-one./

** I recall reading a long story where, essentially, potion squirt guns of a sort were used to arm non-magical people and inexperienced people for battle. For the life of me I can't remember what story it was since it's been literal years.

Offensive and defensive potions do get used in fics, it just isn't super common. I've encountered potions to enhance reaction time at the cost of extra exhaustion later, various healing potions, poisonous and caustic potions thrown, potions that released toxic gases when mixed (and used to that effect), potions to enhance senses like sight and hearing... But they're typically /small/ details in the overall story when they appear.

Think about it - Wizards can already cast Confringo and Bombarda. Why do they actually need volatile Potions on them, where they could go off if they were hit with a spell? If they got Stupified and landed wrong or tried to dodge the wrong way, they could be blown up right there.

Armor needs to be fitted and weighted properly to be effective. The Potion you're describing would fuse your joints together.

** Harry creates an offensive potion in HPMOR. In the work leading up to it, we find that creating potions isn't terribly difficult once you figure out the principle behind it, but the principle (like many other such) is not taught or written down anywhere, because it is too dangerous to be used by the unwise. So everyone who can make potions has independently figured out the method for themselves.

Flitwick and McGonagall have a conniption when Harry figures it out. They then tell him that yes, it's already known, and now that he has figured out the secret he has to keep quiet about it.
