So I have been reading a tonne of post war fics recently but every one I have read so far is with Ginny (not that I have a particular problem with that) and I was wondering if there are any good ones where he is not with Ginny?

Edit: Oops should have probably mentioned I am not a fan of Slash so if it could be avoided please. Cheers guys.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8554615/1/The-Lost-Summer][The Lost Summer]] is fairly entertaining, even with the Weasley bashing. I'll let you discover the ships on your own.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9364319/1/Escape][Escape]] is something different, H/Hr.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4757373/1/Heart-s-Home][Heart's Home]] is also pretty good, H/Hr/L.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4978002/1/Dangling-Legs][Dangling Legs]] is really good, but keep the tissues handy. H/Tonks.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4544334/1/Harry-Potter-Mercenary][Harry Potter, Mercenary]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6568694/1/Harry-Potter-Hit-Wizard][Harry Potter, Hit Wizard]] are both pretty hilarious, but they both bash pretty much everyone.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7251575/1/She-ll-Tell-You-It-s-The-Only-Way-To-Be][She'll Tell You it's the Only Way to Be]] is a one-shot, but a damn good one. H/L.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9004333/1/Starting-Over][Starting Over]] is decent, and contains a ship you don't see very often. H/Andi/??

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8585967/1/The-Dark-Side-of-the-Sun][The Dark Side of the Sun]] is a pretty fun one-shot, H/Tracy.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7508571/1/The-Fall-of-the-house-of-Potter][The Fall of the House of Potter]] is really awesome. It contains the actual end of the war, but it was close enough to add and too good to pass up.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3808497/1/The-Road-Not-Taken][The Road Not Taken]] is a one-shot that fixes that crappy epilogue. H/Hr.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9086166/1/Warrior-Witch][Warrior Witch]] is a badass H/Hr fic, if not exceptionally well-written.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7930772/1/We-Will-Be-Together-Again][We Will Be Together Again]] is a double-angst burger with a side of angst, but if that's what you're hungry for it'll whet your appetite. H/Hr.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5324173/1/Why-Won-t-They-Leave-Me-Alone][Why Won't They Leave Me Alone?]] has lots of bashing, but it's still pretty entertaining. H/Hr.

[[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Happily_Ever_After/index/][Happily Ever After]] and [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope]] by Jeconais are both very good, if you don't mind stupidly-powerful Harry and a helping of angst. Both are H/Gabrielle.

** How about with Hermione?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5801908/1/Where-Credit-is-Due][Where Credit is Due]] - Hermione tries to convince Harry to accept his Order of Merlin, but he refuses.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1033104/1/Come-Together][Come Together]] - It's four years after the Trio has graduated from Hogwarts, and they're about to live together again for the first time. But will old friends remain old friends... or will they become something more?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4703843/1/That-Old-House][That Old House]] - An old house sits at the end of a lane. Abandoned and forgotten, no one would have guessed who was going to buy it... or how full a life that old house was yet to live. (/This made my heart hurt, but in a good way/)
