Do these actually exist? I've never really been a fan of slash, and the fact that 99% of these fics seems to be Harry/Voldemort makes it even worse.

So what i'm asking is if anyone know some good Dark Harry fics without slash.


** Check out [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/][Dark Lord Potter Forums]] they really dislike slash there and there is an entire section for Dark Arts!Harry

** I'm not sure if this is what you want, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4545504/1/Aspirations][Aspirations]] is a Dark!Harry/Ginny where they use dark magic but aren't evil.

**** I haven't read it in a while, but I think I remember there being some strange passages early on that I must've gotten used by the end.

** This story is in progress. Very well done so far. Highly recommend it. Dark bad ass Harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9729235/1/Wand-Knife-and-Silence][*Wand, Knife and Silence*]] By: Wanda Ginny Greenleaf Samantha Zabini, black widow and professional assassin, sees Harry on the doorstep of his abusive relatives and decides to do something about it. She takes him to her home where she raises him in the art of death and sabotage. Much later, a sixteen year old Harry's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire. Dumbledore will regret that move. Casanova Harry, rating will go up

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7544355/1/When-a-Veela-Cries][When A Veela Cries]] involves Harry learning plenty of dark magic, but he doesn't become evil (or at least hasn't yet). It's one of the better Harry/Fleur stories out there (probably top 2), and is still being actively updated.

Word of warning: get through the first 5 chapters. Seriously. The first chapter is outright bad. The the next four get progressively better. At chapter 6 and 7, there is a /gigantic/ jump in quality. As if the writer had just taken and passed several college English courses, and had also acquired several betas.
