** My Follows, order of "Last Updated", with one exception.

- *A Long Journey Home* by /Rakeesh/\\
  My absolute uncontested favorite fanfic. Awesome, uncontested worldbuilding, well-written canon characters, well-written OCs, an intriguing story, nice pacing, I love it. If Rakeesh would only sit down and write, the updates are super slow (6 - 12 months per chapter), but it's still worth it.

--------------

- *Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin* by /The Sinister Man/\\
  I like this story, it has a lot of neat world building, a non-evil Dumbledore, and is generally interesting. It's actively updated.

- *Henrietta Potter and the Secret of the Horcrux* by /Guest000/\\
  I help to beta this story, and I like it.

- *Hermione Granger and the Serpent's Renaissance* by /epsi10n/\\
  "Hermione is the reincarnation of Slytherin" - It's not that great, but it has lots of neat stuff in it. It gets progressively more AU as time goes on. I was hoping it was a bit faster going, but the slow divergence from canon is also okay.

- *Blindness* by /AngelaStarCat/\\
  I don't really follow it that actively anymore. The beginning was great and I thoroughly recommend it, but it's dragging on a bit now.

- *Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw* by /LeadVonE/\\
  If you ignore a few flaws, it's a neat fic.

- *A Dramatic Reading* by /White Squirrel/\\
  White Squirrel is a lovely author, even though I find they stick a bit too close to canon. Anyways, this fic has great potential so far.

- *Core Threads* by /theaceoffire/\\
  Like Blindness the beginning was great, but it's a bit slow right now, especially the last two chapters are a bit weak imo.

- *I was never a scarecrow* by /dogbertcarroll/\\
  It hasn't been updated yet (4 Chapters published 1.5 months ago), but it's a lovely Canon!Harry meets Ravenclaw!Harry story. The cool thing is that they are totally okay with each other, and Ravenclaw!Harry isn't super-powerful. It really liked the story so far, it has a nice atmosphere.

- *Just How Can a Computer Do Magic? !* by /Quatermass/\\
  Sequel to *Is Your Great-Aunt an AI? !* by /Quatermass/ - It's the first crossover I liked, a Harry Potter / Portal Crossover. glados is written neatly, Harry is just insane enough, and portal-guns are a fun thing in Hogwarts to have.

- *The Goblet's Surprise* by /furyvore/\\
  One of my favorite new fics. I'd like to see where it's going, but I liked it so far.

- *Shadow Walker* by /lorien829/\\
  I think this is finished somewhere, but I liked this fic very much. It has a sad undertone, but isn't scary or completely desperate. One of my favorite fics.

- *Great Things* by /redfoxrabbit/\\
  Harry Potter is raised by Ollivander. It's a neat fic so far, sadly it doesn't update that often anymore (Last Update in 2016), but it is a fun read so far, if I recall correctly.

It just kinda jumped the shark by making Harry more and more super!Harry. Just way too much... Harry doesn't have to become superior in everything to make a place for himself. Meh.

**** I think at this point the person Harry has come to be paired up with Hermione has nowhere else to go but being stronger and/or smarter. While the potion-pill arc might take some time it doesn't feel like it will hold Harry up.

From this point on I think space exploration will be a sure fire way for Harry to improve himself as is his prerogative as a scientist.

#+begin_quote
  What happened to the Other Hermione that Harry encountered in "Shadow Walks"? As she struggles to survive, despite immense loss, in a world that no longer has a place for her, how will the reappearance of someone she'd thought she'd never see again change her life completely? Reading "Shadow Walks" first is advised. Companion piece; alternate universe.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  Petunia sends a baby Harry to her aunt, living in America, Caroline Evans. Some years later, Caroline becomes GLaDOS, and only Harry stops her from her rampage.

** Recently updated WIPs I'm following:

Linkffn(like grains of sand in the hourglass by temporal knight) Tonks goes back one year in time during the DOM fight. She metamorphs into a girl Harry's age and enrolls at Hogwarts to try to avert Sirius' death. I like it because it's the first time I've seen a long term time travel accident that goes back less than a year in time, horcruxes aren't mentioned as Tonks doesn't know about them, and Tonks is a cool character paired with Harry.

Linkffn(triumphant, the dreamer) SI/OC twin of Harry, who is really a reborn 40 year old woman who basically raises Harry. The petty power dynamics with Petunia and Heather's determination to give Harry a good childhood in spite of their abusive family is interesting. They're in their first year at Hogwarts now.

Linkffn(lady Archimedes) sequel to The Arithmancer. Currently in sixth year, starring a genius mathematician Hermione and a more serious escalating war.

Linkffn(the Hogwarts six and the darkest wizard) currently in fourth year, follows a dark Slytherin OFC who replaced Hermione and her friends Daphne, Tracy, Harry, Ron, and Neville.

I like my badass, proactive witch protagonists. /shrugs/

** Currently reading linkffn(Order of Mercy by MandyinKC), linkffn(Child of Hogwarts, Part III: The Master of Death by AimeretVivre)- you'll need to read the two before it though which are complete, linkffn(Divided and Entwined by Starfox5), linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh by Northumbrian), and last but opposite of least, it just isn't updated regulary, linkffn(Grow Young with Me by Taliesin19).

All of these are good in their own ways, Order of Mercy is the first Percy-centric fic that I have really enjoyed, and I like how it tells a story in canon that is really separate from anything that we know about canon through the books. Child of Hogwarts has its weaknesses and strengths, but it's just a fun series that I've continued to watch because I think it does well to highlight how different Harry would've been treated and hopefully it shows how things could have went better if they had paid more attention to him and trained him earlier and got him away from the Dursleys. Divided and Entwined has built a great world where Muggleborns organized and fought back, organized by our favorite Muggleborn Hermione (flaw in it is that it seems to feature next to no Muggleborn adults which I find fairly weird). Strangers of Drakeshaugh is one of Northumbrians better work, and I consider her my favorite canon writer, and she's developed a great OC muggle in this story, less about magic and more about relationships and a kind inquisitive woman who seems to be oblivious to this magic world she's just on the outside of. And finally, Grow Young with Me, one of my favorite fics of all time and Abigail Waters, my favorite OC (and OC muggle) of all time who has Harry as a patron of her coffee shop she works at and won't leave him alone. There's a lot more to the story but I won't spoil it. The fic is updated very sparsely but in my opinion is still very much worth it everytime it is updated.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/10979995/1/][*/My Effect: Convergence/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2969995/Lanilen][/Lanilen/]]

#+begin_quote
  My disappointment with the original ending of Mass Effect 3 was, I think, shared by many. At the time I thought I had to do something about it. What I didn't expect was for my wish to be granted by being transplanted into the Mass Effect universe, where I had to fix an awful lot more than I expected. A phrase about writing a check and having to pay came to mind...

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** One of my favorites lately is linkao3(7632367) - it's the third book in a Slytherin!Harry series and I really enjoy it! It usually updates about once a week. It is a bit of a canon rehash, but there's enough differences to keep it fresh imo.

#+begin_quote
  -- This book is a continuation of my universe in which Harry is sorted into Slytherin. The major plot points remain the same for the most part, but have been altered through the eyes of Harry being surrounded by snakes, not lions.-- While this book is tagged Snape/Harry please note there is no relationship beyond that of a mentor between them in this book. I have no interest in writing a majorly underage student/teacher fic :) Books 4+ will likely have more of that... I tagged it as such so that people don't start reading it for Mentor!Snape and then surprise!Book Three!! Holy moley, we're here! I really appreciate all the comments and encouragement I've been getting. It makes writing when I'm not super up for it a lot easier! This book IS a part of a series, you could just jump in, but I really suggest reading books 1 and 2. The eventual goal is a retelling of the entire series, so stick around <3Again: thank you, thank you, thank you to everyone who reads and leaves kudos and comments. They mean the world to me!~This fic is a gift for my sister Chewbecca and my bestie StarlightWolf~

** linkao3(Harry's Cousins)

It's a story where Lucius and Narcissa adopt Harry into their family when they find him at the Dursley's when the couple went to their place for a business dinner. It's a moving fic, and I'm happy to see the Malfoy's painted in a good stead for once.

  The Dursleys have never wanted Harry, so when he fortuitously stumbles across a book on Wizard Family Trees, he writes a letter, hoping to find another family to take him in, hopefully one that won't mind when he does 'freaky' stuff....WIP

#+begin_quote
  As Albus and Scorpius begin their life together, Albus discovers that married life is every bit as wonderful and difficult as he always anticipated it would be. Life is better now that they're free from the looming threat of a Dark Arts resurgence, but Albus quickly realizes that there are plenty of other threats, too, like aggravating bosses and unexpected bouts of baby fever. Meanwhile, officials within the Ministry unearth a rapidly-worsening problem: for reasons unknown, the frequency of Squib births has quietly and suddenly quadrupled, leading to serious concerns over what might be prohibiting wizards and witches from passing on their magical genes-- and what that might mean for the coming generations of Wizardkind. While James and his new Ministry department struggle to deal with the societal impacts of an unprecedented amount of Squib children, Lily and Albus find their jobs--and their lives--intersecting in an unexpected way.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

  Sequel to Child of the Storm. Harry's life has changed a lot over the past year, what with the return of his father, Thor, murder attempts by everything from HYDRA assassins to Elder Gods keeping him on his toes and making a few new friends. But while Chthon and HYDRA are gone, all sorts of dark things have been stirred up, things thought long gone. And guess who they're after...

But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.
