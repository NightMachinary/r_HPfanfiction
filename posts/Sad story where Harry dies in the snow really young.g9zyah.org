Hi, I was looking for a fanfic where Harry had a twin brother who was thought to be the bwl, and so Harry was rarely cared for. In the end Harry runs into the forest and freezes to death. His parents find a pensive in his room and find out that he was the true bwl. It's a one shot and I can't find it anymore, it was so sad. Can anyone tell me the name?


** That sounds so tragic :(

** From ElusiveGuy comment:

" Found thanks to the storyid & author from [[/u/Impulse92]] and [[/u/Eawen_Telemnar]], and of course the archive from [[/u/nerdguy1138]]

It's markdown-formatted so you can use a site like [[http://markdownlivepreview.com/]] if you prefer the formatted version.

...and now I'm sad :( "

Tell me if it's that one

** I've found a few references to the fic that make me think it's called "Missing" but I'm having a hard time finding the fic itself.
