** I would love to recommend [[https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/dp/133821666X][The Cursed Child]] by JK rowling. It's a really great fanfic and in one of the alternate universes Ron gets together with Padma. Hope that's what you're searching for.

*** You've heard of death of the author, now get ready for: death by the author! Where a content creator beats their dead horse so far into the ground it descends into hell somehow!

I'm not going to read that monstrosity.

** The other comments are straight clowning. Anyway I don't think Hermione would be able to tolerate that. I mean, canon clearly shows that when Ron and Lavender got together Hermione was pissed and attacked Ron.

*** Yeah, I'm looking for examples of non Romione where neither character is treated like shit. Personally I think Joanne really could have done a better job preserving the characters' previously established motivation and personalities while still ending up at the same end game relationship. It unintentionally made Hermione look like a terrible person and tried, failingly, to present Ron as the one in the wrong. JKR was not really hitting in the ballpark there, but hey! I know a fuck ton of fanfictions that are better than the source material.
