I've found a few here and there but my scouring skills are inept at finding a bunch so I'm looking for some assistance. Any/all would be wonderful. :D


** Might have found it already on fanfiction.net, but Too Close by scared of clouds is a pretty good fic there. It's an AU (obviously) twist on the more typical fic Auror Harry protects Quidditch player Ginny by reversing the roles there.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1482917/hgfan1111][hgfan1111]] had quite a few of those, unfortunately she took them all down. Not sure if they're available anywhere anymore. [[http://dukebrymin.livejournal.com/63318.html][This post]] has a list of them which might help googling. Specifically Easier to Be, Frayed Ends, and Gravity fit the description.

As far as fics that are still online, there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7630045/1/A-Set-Up-Gone-Wrong][A Setup Gone Wrong]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7663066/1/The-First-Annual-Weasley-Brothers-Halloween-Extr][The First Annual Weasley Brothers' Halloween Extravaganza]] which are both good.

** This is kind of after the war but it's AU in that things play out differently. But, it's quite good [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=311797]]
