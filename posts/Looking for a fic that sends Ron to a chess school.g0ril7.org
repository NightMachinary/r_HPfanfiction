I barely remember anything else about this story besides the fact that Ron is "gotten out of the way" by sending him to a chess school. There's a few scenes of him in said school later on, can't really do more detail.


** 'Lord of Caer Azkaban' has Ron attending a chess school in Moscow.

  A letter causes Harry to learn some surprising things about his lineage, a different twist on the usual Harry in Azkaban story line.

** Oh I remember this fic! Unfortunately, I don't remember what its called. However! If I've read it, there's a good chance its complete! I also have an inkling that its might be a time travel fanfic? Maybe, I dunno. Anyway, comment boost, good luck finding it!
