So Dethryl just uploaded the first chapter of the fifth "book" in his excellent Slytherin!Harry series, They Shook Hands, which you can find [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9158765/1/They-Shook-Hands-Year-5][Here.]] He's already finished writing and beta-ing year 5, so it is finished, but won't be posted all at the same time. I just thought I'd give a head's up to anyone who was following the series, or is interested in a good Slytherin!Harry story.

If you haven't read any of the series yet, or it's been awhile, here is the revised copy of the [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7659033/1/They-Shook-Hands-PostCanon-Revision-Year-One][First Year]], the [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7786722/1/They-Shook-Hands-PostCanon-Revision-Year-Two][Second Year]], the [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7949779/1/They-Shook-Hands-PostCanon-Revision-Year-Three][Third Year]], and the [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8120562/1/They-Shook-Hands-PostCanon-Revision-Year-Four][Fourth Year.]] Happy reading!


** Is this slash?

*** No, no slash. It's rated T, and any romance in it is pretty basic and controlled. They shook hands is pretty much the most realistic Slytherin Harry that I've read. It creates a valid picture of how Harry would have been changed had he and Malfoy not gotten off on the wrong foot. It doesn't create a super harry, or future dark lord, or any of some of the other tropes that Slytherin fan fics have. It's good, trust me.

** I [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanficRecs/HarryPotterForWantOfANail][encoutered]] claim that it turns Gryffindor into something like canon!Slytherin - almost everybody is either stupid or bully (inluding bashing of Hermione and Ron). Is it correct?

*** Yeah... it kinda is unfortunately. Even the most well-crafted fics have a few make-it-or-break-it flaws.

The Slytherins are painted with a more realistic brush, making them a wee bit more sympathetic than their canon counterparts, but the majority of Gryffindors are portrayed as belligerent assholes, Ron in particular. Hermione, who was sorted into Hufflepuff, is killed in the second book.

Probably won't enjoy this much if you like the Weasleys and the Gryffindor crew.

**** Oh well. It is quite sad that many people complain that Slytherin is "completely evil house", sort Harry into Slytherin and make Gryffindor "completely evil house".

I see no problem with properly done Weasleys, what includes well done evil!Weasleys. On the other hand Hermione in Hufflepuff is sign of extreme OOC, Sorting Hat done in way that I dislike or author hating this character and for some reason thinking that bashing is better that not introducing somebody. And I really like Hermione.

Thanks for reply!

*** Well, Harry becoming friends with Malfoy had the same effect as Harry becoming friends with Ron did in canon. Both greatly altered his view points, and made him biased to the opposing side. So while Ron told him that Slytherins were evil, and then Malfoy reinforced it by being an arrogant git in canon, the same effect was accomplished by Malfoy being nice, and then having Ron be a total git, cause Harry to go more with that point of view. So, when reading it, you have to remember that it's from that point of veiw, a Slytherin Harry, whose first impressions of "gryfindors" was Ron. But that doesn't mean all Gryfindors are viewed as Ron. Without giving the story away, there are a few gryfindors that the Slytherins like. And finally, as to Hermione, you gotta remember, she was rather annoying at first, and only began to change when she became friends with Harry and Ron. Take away the canon Harry, and she might have not changed. But the author handles her pretty nicely, and gives a good explanation as to why he went with what he did. Hope that helps.

**** At least in canon this evil house thing cannot be explained only by viewpoint.

***** The Gryffindors aren't evil, just Ron and a few mates are portrayed as assholes, always trying to start a fight. Ginny, Percy, and, to a lesser extent, Neville, aren't bashed, and two of them are even liked in Slytherin. As to Hermione being sorted into Hufflepuff, it ins't OOC. The story tells us why, and the reason isn't unbelievable. Dethryl stated that he felt, that without Harry being in Gryffindor, Hermione would have had no buffer from Ron's tormenting, and would have had a terrible time at Hogwarts. By placing her in Hufflepuff, he gave her friends, and an enjoyable time, as opposed to being alone and miserable in Gryffindor. The worst any bashing that happens is just the promoting of the image that she is a know-it-all, and that mainly comes from Draco, and Pansy, and is not anywhere near an important element in the story.

****** Maybe it is a bit of definition problem - bashing for me means that author made character stupid/evil/senile/etc due to hate, in way that is not improving story.

Character in story that have unreasonably poor opinion of somebody else in story is IMHO something completely different.
