Frogs Laffend 2: Return of the Lava Alligator

Deep in a mountain far away evil began to take form when a really evil bird laid an egg and it fell down and rolled into a cave and fell in hot lava and then got mutated into a very mean lava alligator . This alligator was so evil and he wanted to kill every wozard who ever lived. He had sharp claws

Meanwhile Frogs Laffemd was at home and frogs Laffend was bored so frogs Laffebd lit up and started listening to the white album when all the sudden. A owl from Hogwarts came giving frogs Laffend a message. Now frogs Laffend was reading the message the message said we need you again frogs Laffend Hogwarts is in trouble once again. A lava alligator made of lava is attacking.

Chapter 2 Frogs laffend goes to Hogwarts

Hogwarts has just been rebuilt after the battle with horse nordfick. But now it was all destroyed again. From the lava alligator. Laffend got called into Dumeldoor's office. Dumbledoor said to Laffend that this alligator had to be stopped and he couldn't be defeated and he even ate dumbledoor's best friend Severus snape. Laffend said okay I can defeat this monster but it will be hard. Dumbledoor said you can't do this alone that's why I am here to introduce you to your new sidekick. From the corner of the room came a guy who looked so tough that he could beat up everything. "My name is Rasku Bowling Pin the man said"

Chapter 3

The alligator was now attacking everybody. By this time he killed every character from harry potter even dumbledoor and even harry potter's dad and even dudley. The reason the alligator wanted to kill them is because he hated magic and wizards and he loved being evil.

Chapter 4 Rasku and frogs first mission together

Now Rasku was off by his own because frogs sent him on an errand to get a magic stone to kill lava alligator. Rasku was mad because frogs was mean to him. When all of the sudden the lava alligator was right there ready to kill Rasku. Rasku thought fast and kicked him right in the head but the alligator didn't feel it. He just snapped rasku's arm right off and chewed it and ate it and swallowed it. Now Rasku said "next time it's personal" then the lava alligator bit his head off.

Chapter 5 a new ally

Finally frogs Laffend and the lava alligator were face to face. Frogs Laffend knew not to mess around with this foe. He cast his most powerful spell called blue screwdriver and the alligators head exploded. "Wow that was easy" said frogs but then the alligator's head re formed. "HAHAHAHAHHA YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD KILL ME THAT EASILY BUT THATS NOT GOOD ENOUGH I CAN EASILY RE GENERATE ANY PART OF MY BODY BECAUSE I AM MADE OF LAVA AND I CAN RE FORM ANY PART OF MY BODY." whispered the lava alligator. Now frogs Laffend tried a water spell called rushing tsunami because he wanted to sizzle him. But that didn't work either. Frogs was in trouble because he couldn't figure out how to kill the crocodile. Then the alligator scratched frogs Laffend so bad. Frogs Laffend said I need to get out of here and he did a teleport spell and teleported to some random place. Frogs was lucky to be alive and now he had no magic energy left and he had a big scratch.

Chapter 5 horse nordfick returns

The next guy on the lava alligator's list was horse nordfick. Horse nordfick said "you just made a big mistake buddy boy" and he fucking did a karate chop so fast to the lava alligator that the lava alligator died. "NOOO !! I never even got to ride kingda ka!! " And then he died forever.

Chapter 6 frogs laffend's lowest point Frogs Laffend was at his lower point. His side kick got killed by the lava alligator and he failed to kill the lava alligator and now his greatest enemy killed the lava alligator. Frogs Laffend was crying.
