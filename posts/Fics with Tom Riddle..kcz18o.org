Recommend me some fanfiction where Tom Riddle (or Sane Voldemort) plays a big role. I just really want some fics that show the genius, charming person he was before the horcruxes turned him insane.

I like the characterization of Tom Riddle in [[https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind&ved=2ahUKEwjX34ml3M3tAhXeyosBHTWOAz4QFjABegQIDxAB&usg=AOvVaw2rp-LXIk4Iv9DcVMGr6ePO][The Well Groomed Mind]]. So if there are any fics like that, I'd love those too.

- Will accept any bashing, pairing, and graphic stories. +


** Linkffn(Monster by Phoenyx634) Evil and charming sociopath riddle paired with an oc who plays at his level.

Linkffn(When Harry Met Tom) Not as evil but still distinctly Riddle. Nice parallels with FemHarry.

Linkffn(Limpieza de Sangre) Good!Fem!Riddle intepretation moulded into Voldemort by circumstances.

Linkffn(Paradox by olivieblake) Moriarty style transdimensional chess player Riddle. Good luck understanding the plot.

  What if Tom met his match in his fifth year at Hogwarts? What if someone upset the power balance before he became The Dark Lord... And changed the trajectory of history? That person is Amalia Gray. (NOT a time-travel fic!) [Awesome]Fem OC x [Evil]Tom Riddle

  When the battle in the department of mysteries heads south, Harry finds herself flung backwards in time to 1942, where Tom Riddle is a prefect in his fifth year. Armed with this knowledge, but little else, Harry desperately tries to find a way home and for once in her life not screw it up. Tom, for his own part, wonders when Harry Evans will head back to the mothership. fem!Harry

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

** One of my favorite fics of all time is linkao3(The Darkening of Your Soul by Meaglin_Yedi). Its a fic where Harry as MOD gets to go back in time and do everything all over again. Only Catch? If he goes back, so does Tom. Toms soul gets glued back together and both Harry and Tom try to change the world.

While you dont see Tom until chapter 5/6-ish, he is in every chapter after that and while the story is very Harry-centric, Tom plays as much of a roll as Harry does and their relationship is so so well written.

  Harry is betrayed. Harry gets a second chance to do it all over again.There is just one catch. If Harry gets to keep his memories from his previous life, so does Voldemort.

  Tom was now standing straight, looking right at her. He was supposed to be horrified by what he just witnessed. He was supposed to feel sick from the images still flashing through his mind. Tom knew she was manipulative and cunning, always a step ahead of everyone and sometimes even himself. Still, he felt like meeting her for the first time on this night for she was not a flame as he thought at the beginning but an entire wildfire. And he was basking in her blazing heat. He looked at the scar on her neck. He must have looked at it hundreds of times yet he truly saw it for the first time. The scar he knew she bore below her coat, the one the purple spell carved, the one he felt and bled through his shirt was right there. And he felt the sudden urge to touch it. She was standing in front of him in all of her glory and she was magnificent.

  Unspeakable Granger wakes up with missing memories in Hogwarts...in 1942. Hermione might not remember much, but she knew that even post-Voldemort, there were many wannabe dark lords she and her friends had to fight against. The world wasn't automatically sunshine and roses just because they've defeated Voldemort.

  Also, go back? What go back? If she doesn't even know how she got here with all the wounds she had, then there's really no guarantee that a safe way to jump forward exists! Yet the possibilities that are open to her... if she could change the wizarding world half a century earlier, maybe they'd be more prepared against dark lords in the future. Perhaps a better world for the friends she'd left. With this in mind, Hermione Curie (Granger) sets out to use her field healer and master arithmancer abilities to the fullest (if she had to invent a couple of things earlier than they actually happened in her old future, so be it). Not to mention that in her very-biased-opinion, the wizarding world needs to be dragged out of its old prejudices, kicking and screaming if necessary. But who is that particular prefect? Her mind itches at seeing him...
