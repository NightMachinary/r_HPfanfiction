:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
A Slytherin Harry and Gryffindor Harry end up en a world where that harry is dead. Both having lost their significant others in their respective worlds, independently attempted time travel, ran into each other, have worked with each other for a while, and end up in a world where there younger self is dead and their mother is alive and they have a sister, I believe the pairings were Haphne and HHr


** Is this a â€˜what's that fic' because I think you have the wrong tag. But this sounds awesome
