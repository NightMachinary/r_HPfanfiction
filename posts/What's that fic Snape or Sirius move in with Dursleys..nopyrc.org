:END:
Since Harry can't leave the house because of the blood wards, the adult moves in. Dudley's second bedroom is enlarged. Petunia is unhappy about it.


** I know a fic where Remus and Sirius live in the Dursleys backyard or something like that, if that's what you're talking about :) (it was a great fic even if it isn't the one)

  “Fine,” said Sirius calmly. “We'll live in the garden.”“What?” said Remus.“What?” said Petunia.Vernon did his best impression of a walrus mixed with a tomato.“You don't want to raise him,” said Sirius, with the air of describing something to the incredibly dimwitted, “and we sure as hell don't want you to bloody raise him. But he can't leave your property; he's got to call this...” he gestured disdainfully at the living room, “a home until he's of age. So we'll live in the back garden.”(formerly 'Moony and the Dogfather')
