I don't mean the occasional fluff. I mean, pour it on mates.

Preferably straight relationships if you got'em.


** linkffn(Hermione Granger, Demonologist) has the fluffiest, most adorable Hermione ever.

******** Okay, so in the available Flowerpot fics, 98% of them are trash. There is a VERY good reason why my flair is Garbage Sifter. A perusal through the top reviewed Flowerpot fics on FF.net will not help matters much. Most of the most "popular" fics are pretty bad harem fics. I've tried to give you what I consider the best of all the ones I know of, but I encourage you to do your own sifting if you like any of these!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7402590/1/Deprived][Deprived]] - This is a really fun angsty, power fantasy. It was abandoned unfortunately, but what's there is a ton of fun. Don't take it too seriously. Top 4 fics of all time for me.

[[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Enslavement/index/][Enslavement]] - This one was originally a one shot, but was expanded when Jeconais remade it (don't worry I don't only ready angst!). This is kind of fun and is only loosely Flowerpot in reality, but a fun quick read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5142565/1/Knowledge-is-Power][Knowledge is Power]] - Possibly one of my top 4 fics of all time, it's just a really great read. Beginning is a little rough, but once it gets going its so wonderful. Unfortunately it also was abandoned, but it's quite the read!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6535391/1/Letters][Letters]] - Written by TE7 this one is a really good read! Wonderful romance! It recently got a new chapter this past Christmas. I haven't read this one in a while, but I really like it when I did.

This last recommendation isn't Flowerpot but is Harry/Gabbrielle but is really fluffy and sweet: [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope]].

Now if you read all of those and do a little more research into Flowerpot fics, you may realize that there is a glaring omission of the most popular Flowerpot fic that happens to rhyme with Vadmean Cictory. This is a very polarizing fic that people either love or hate. I have been on both sides of the argument, in so far as I used to openly defend it but then moved to relentlessly ridiculing it. DO NOT READ THIS FIC FIRST NO MATTER WHAT. It will give you a very poor impression of what Flowerpot can be. All that said, if you loved what you read, you might want to give it a shot. and form your own opinion. Just be warned.

********* Hm.

I've read Cadmean. I was an edgelord at that point and hadn't read anything else, but I know it.

I've read Deprived. I've read Letters. I apparently need to create an account to read Enslavement, so that's sad.

I'll get to the others.

********** Oh yeah that's right, I forgot you need one FFauthors. It's worth it for all the other fics you can find, so if you have the time I'd go for it.

Ahhhh I'm sorry, I erred on the side of caution and assumed you were new to Flowerpot. We really are quite squeezed for good fics!

************ Ahhhh too true. Hopefully we get some new blood or content coming with the new Fantastic Beasts film.

I sometimes pass the time with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9484157/1/The-Flurry-of-Life][Flurry of Life]] but it's more like a one a day thing. I would recommend getting an account and looking at Jeconais fics if you haven't read them already. Some pretty good fluff there.

** A Wonderful Caricature of Intimacy (just google it, on FFN) is pretty fluffy, though Dramione (sorry if that's not what you're looking for). Post-war reformed Draco has a super cute kid from a previous marriage whom he sends to preschool where Hermione's the teacher. Fluff ensues when she agrees to be the boy's mother figure. There's no violence or any sort of conflict, mostly slow and heartwarming.

*** Similar to this is Charm, by Silverquill11, don't think it's on ffn anymore but I did find it awhile back on another site. Anyway, same thing with Draco's kid, except Hermione is a world-class healer who takes care of the kid after his memory is wiped right at the start.
