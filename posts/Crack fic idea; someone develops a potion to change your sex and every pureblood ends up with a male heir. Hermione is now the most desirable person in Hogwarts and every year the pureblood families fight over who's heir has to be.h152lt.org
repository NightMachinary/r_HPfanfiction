** Well couldn't they just take the potion, temporarily be female, have the baby, and then switch back with the potion?

*** Possibly. Then again, the OP doesn't specify whether the potion can be used multiple times. In linkffn(Effects and Side Effects), Draco uses a potion to turn Harry female, and he ends up in trouble for line theft, as I recall, because he took out the Black heir who was ahead of him.

I've read two stories where Draco was originally female, and Lucius had him potioned from infancy to be male for purposes of being an heir. In [[https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/fanfictionfederation/the-wizard-that-never-was-t52.html][one of them]], he was actually a stolen Delacour girl.

  Voldemort didn't like what happened at the Department of Mysteries and viewed the connection as a liability he could no longer afford. The steps he took changed Harry's life forever, and set him on the path to victory. Fem Harry. Harry.Multi.

***** As I recall, it was one chapter in a collection of one-shots. Malfoy was harassing Harry in the hallways, who suspects Snape is hanging around waiting for an opportunity to take points, so Harry just whirled around and hit Draco with a finite, which instantly turned him female. Pansy wass as upset as Draco, but McGonagall told Snape he couldn't take points since Harry didn't cast an actual spell. Not much more to it than that.
