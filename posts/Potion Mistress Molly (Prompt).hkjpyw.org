Since indy! fics love Molly brewing potions, what if Molly Weasley was the Potions Professor at Hogwarts? How would this change the dynamics of the story. Snape can still be Dumbledore's spy or you can remove his character all together. What would her teaching style be? I would like to read her teaching about Love Potions given her fanon hobby.


** Good!Potions!Molly:

"Today, we'll be learning about the Draught of Affection, which makes the drinker feel affectionate towards anyone for a few hours... It's usually used to, well, never you mind that. I'll tell you once you graduate.

Now, don't expect true love to come from this - or any - potion, or for the affection to be directed at /you/. When I say "anyone", I mean exactly that, it'll make the drinker affectionate towards whomever they interact with, for the hour the potion lasts.\\
Don't make the mistakes I did... Oh, but if I start reminiscing now we'll never finish our assignments.

There, instructions are on the board. Be careful to crush those seeds - your textbook wrongly says to cut them. Crushing is easier and releases more juice, not to mention it keeps you from having to handle a knife. Don't want anyone to lose a finger, after all.

MISS PARKINSON! HOW DARE YOU TRY TO KILL MY SON! THAT'LL BE A HUNDRED POINTS FROM SLYTHERIN, AND IF YOU EVER DO IT AGAIN I'LL SEE YOU EXPELLED! Ronald, dear, go put on some clean underwear, you probably need it after that explosion. Off you go!"

--------------

I have trouble writing Molly Weasley as a bad person (which Potions!Molly often is), but I am 100% on board with "kind but embarrassing parent Molly" who just happens to be /good/ at Potions. Kind of hoping this snippet will spark a full-length fic from someone who's better at writing prompt-fics than me.
