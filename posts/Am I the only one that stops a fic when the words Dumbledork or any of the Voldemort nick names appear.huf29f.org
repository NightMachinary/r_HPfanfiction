***** Well it depends on what you mean by liberties. They can certainly reinvent a character from scratch or change key moments in their backstory so that the character is different from canon. But a lot of times they just go overboard with one particular aspect of the character. Like with the misunderstood Snape trope. They over-blow the good parts of him (which are really tiny) and act as if every moment of his life since he became a double agent for Dumbledore was a major sacrifice. It wasn't, he was a dick. One good deed doesn't erase a life time of being a dick. If the author went all the way to the beginning of Snape's life and highlighted how and why he got to a place where he was truly a good person who was misunderstood by those around him, causing him to turn to dark magic only for him to regret his choices and seek redemption, then that would be fine.

******* Honestly sounds more like a you problem at this point. Voldemort's name is feared by the adults, and that fear was passed down to the children. If Harry and co are using dumb joke names about their scariest opponent, it can be used as a way for their larger group to slowly lose that fear. Who could possibly fear a man named Moldyshorts, or worse, Tommy boy?

I'm sorry to say that you and the OP have a terrible lack of banter in your lives if you can't appreciate that most people will devolve to the humor levels of a fourteen year old in highly stressful situations, y'know, like the middle of a war.

There's similar banter thrown about in most if not all war movies, especially those based on real accounts. There's similar banter in Homer's stories, and Shakespeare's. Please do not act as if humor in the face of terror is somehow a bad thing---you'd likely die of shock once we began speaking of gallows humor.

** Dumbledork is usually a sign of relentless Dumbledore bashing and I have no taste for it, and seldom finish reading those kind of fics. I remember an instance of reading a completely smashed Harry Potter sitting in Aberforth's bar saying "damn Dumbledore" while meaning Albus while Aberforth grumbles about it and that highlights my whole problem with it. It is about as juvenile as Malfoy's "Potty", something Harry doesn't even return like that in canon.

That said, Harry mocking Voldemort is something I can appreciate a while lot more. And of course special mention to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3689325/1/The-Original-Naked-Quidditch-Match]] the Voldemort mocking going on in this fic is nothing short of brilliance.

** I don't know the specifics but the Carrows call Dumbledore "Dumby" in HPB and Peeves says "Voldy's gone moldy" in DH. If it's satire I don't mind it, if someone says it to insult one of the two I also don't mind it, if a writer uses it constantly but it claims to be a serious fic, I probably won't even bother with it.

** If you've got Voldemort calling Dumbledore 'old coot' or 'senile old fool' its understandable. Or if it's a light Dumbledore bash I can see Harry or Sirius using it. With Voldemort, the occasional insult from Harry is perfectly acceptable, after all, he murdered Harry's parents...

** Dumbledork is sorta funny the first time reading it, but repeated uses of it sorta comes off cringe to read and I can't take the character as seriously. Moldyshorts just sorta kills the vibe immediately. I can see how the childishness of it would come about in teens such as they are usually the ones using it, but it doesn't really negate the fact that it is rough to read as a viewer.

** Yes.

Typically, when a derivation of these nicknames are used, it's an indication of the rest of the fic. Those types are cliche-ridden, trope-filled Indie!Harry cringefests.

Besides, there are plenty of ways to slight someone without using such names -- Hell, even basic body-language.

** ITT some people are agreeing you with a comment starting with the word yes and others are agreeing with you starting with a comment with the word no.

In any case it's a major red flag for me, but it depends on the context. I'll usually let it slide if I otherwise like the fic and it's one of the only issues, but fics that do this often have many other things I don't like. However there's several FMA crossovers I like where Ed uses such nicknames for Voldemort, but that generally seems inline with his character and in these fics his grasp of English is often not 100% anyway, so it doesn't bother me as much.
