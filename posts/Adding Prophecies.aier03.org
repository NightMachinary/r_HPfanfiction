It is not uncommon to come across stories which add their own prophecies, most of which are either another version of Trewlaney's first and deal with the defeat of Voldemort (but with a twist) or are used to facilitate shipping.

But has anyone actually read a story where the subject was handled decently and not something akin to "and with the power of love, three will prevail."? Because even after reading tens of millions of words, I can't recall a single case where an original prophecy actually was a good story element.


** linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom) had an interesting prophecy but the fic is incomplete and the prophecy is unresolved.

** I liked the way the prophecy was handled in /To Reach Without,/ even though the Voldemort conflict is overall the weakest part of the story in my opinion. linkffn(To Reach Without by inwardtransience)

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.

** /HPMOR/ is probably the most creative takes on non-canonical Prophecies I know of, with the caveat that it's an AU where Prophecies work notably differently.

** I had a Goblin seer who picked up on the same prophecy as Trelawney, but it took on a slightly different meaning when translated into the Goblin language. Basically, when writing that chapter, I took the original prophecy and ran it through google translate. English to German to Hindi to Chinese to English, and then I put it back into the typical format. Enough changed to make it plausible.

(I also have a second prophecy in play as well, but haven't revealed it in full)

** Both /Dragon Lily/ and its remake /The End of All Things Magical/ have a more far-reaching prophecy, but the first is a bad smut fic (has some decent ideas though), and the remake was abandoned four chapters in.

** I actually have an AU 5th year story with an original prophecy, which is entirely different from Trelawney's. I haven't posted the prophecy chapter itself yet (full disclosure there), but it's written out and coming shortly. The whole story is written actually, and I'm posting a couple chapters a week, so the whole thing will be up fairly soon. I'd definitely love to know if you think it works as a good story element, if you'd like to check it out! I do hope it does.

When a devastating attack on Hogwarts causes Harry to switch places with his on-screen counterpart, Daniyel Bluelake, Harry is thrown into an unfamiliar Muggle world where his life is just a fantasy. His job? Acting. Meanwhile, Daniyel will discover what it truly means to be a wizard as he learns to separate the magical fantasy world he's always known from its dark reality. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, Dan's happy days at Hogwarts are certainly numbered, and a showdown with Voldemort seems inevitable. But what can Dan do, in Harry's place? And how high will the cost be... to switch them back?
