Harry Potter but he Learns magic like from hocus-pocus movie or more Like you seen the old witch movies where they stand over a cauldron and have spell books they make themselves

Update:: Yeah it's like eye of toad and frog of newt When I think about witches I think of blood magic and sacrifice magic with potion magic Where they do eye of toad And then put a load of other stuff in the cauldron as well while saying the spell


** I've never seen Hocus Pocus so I don't know the type of magic you're talking about. Is it still incantations and wand-waving and such, or is it more 'eye of toad and frog of newt, now we'll get to see that boot' sort of a deal?

**** Hmm, okay. Well, it's not technically 'witchery', but there's a fic called Druid of Holly and Yew that I think is almost exactly what you want. Harry is a druid, not a witch, but it's the same idea of magic.
