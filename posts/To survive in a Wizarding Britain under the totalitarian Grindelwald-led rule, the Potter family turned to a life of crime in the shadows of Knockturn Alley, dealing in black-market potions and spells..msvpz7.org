** In response to Grindelwald's German fascist wizard-supremacy Tom Riddle forges an ideology of Marxism with Dumbledorian Characteristics, attempting to unify disenfranchised wizards and muggles to form a new order under his leadership, with the mustachioed Inspector Crouch being left in charge of Grindelwald's anti-communist efforts in Britain. Crouch finds success against Riddle's forces in northern ireland but runs into a snag when noted revolutionary Ronnie Weasley turns to his childhood best friend for help, the ascending Marauders gang leader Harry Potter.

** I absolutely love this vibe. I have this image of Harry being Finn and Euphemia yelling at Sirius because “I found Harry playing with a gun the other day! A loaded gun! He said he got it from you. What have you got to say for yourself?”

However I pose that Tom Riddle is Tommy Shelby +because Cillian Murphy absolutely HAS to play Tom Riddle+ because I feel like so much of both Toms actions stemmed from a fear of death and a striving to be someone. A shrugging off of the common, a rising from the depths of obscurity.

** Here are some of my random thoughts when I came up with this idea:

- Fleamont Potter was forced to turn the Potter family to a life of crime after he and his father Henry were on the losing side of the Grindelwald conflict. Though Henry was executed, Fleamont survived and the Potter name faded into the backwaters of society. They now deal in dangerous and illegal enchantments and potions, mingling with such revolutionaries as the so-called Order of the Phoenix seeking to oppose Grindelwald.
- Euphemia Potter is still alive though Fleamont has died. She is the absolute matriarch of the family and has been a mother to not just James but also his friends and fellow outcasts the Marauders. Formidable, acid-tongued but also grandmotherly and wise, Euphemia is the one who keeps the Potters 'good' despite their shady dealings. I picture her like Diana Rigg or Judi Dench.
- James and Lily are very much still in love. She was an outcast in the Wizarding World for being a Mudblood (Muggle-born is now an outdated term) and was saved from life in the labour camps by an adolescent James. She was tutored in Potions by Fleamont himself.
- Sirius was taken in by the Potters after being disowned from his family. The Black Family are high-ranking aristocrats who fully support the Grindelwald ideology. Sirius is the Arthur Shelby of the family, so to speak, and can be incredibly volatile and angry.

** I really love this idea and would be tempted to write it but I've never written a fanfic before so I don't think I could do it well
