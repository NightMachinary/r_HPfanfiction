What it says on the tin.

Can include full or mostly Genderbend (i.e. all characters or most genderbent), only some, or only Harry.

I say this because I am interested in possibly writing a fanfiction with both a genderbent Harry /and/ a genderbent Tom Riddle, and I want to read some stories to get a good grasp on how a gender swap would affect the characters.

Not looking for transgender fics, but ones in which Harry is born a female and identifies as female (cisgender).

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

  Voldemort knows the prophecy, when he is reborn following the 3rd task of the Triwizard Tournament he takes action to ensure that Harry is no longer a threat. AU. HPLL This story will be updated slowly so that I can finish my other stories.

  The first thing everyone noticed about Hope Potter was that she may have had her mother's face, but she had her father's penchant for causing trouble or somehow finding only made sense that she would fall for a prankster, and it only made sense that danger was attracted to her very scent. Somehow, she was going to prove she was more than just the Girl-Who-Lived. FemHarry.

** As you might expect, you are not the first one to ask --- and certainly not the last one. But still: Did you try searching for fem!harry fics. They are usually cisgendered except for a few exceptions.

Here's a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/search?q=fem%21harry&sort=relevance&restrict_sr=on][link to an appropriate search term]]

*** Help me out here. cisgendered does mean that there is no such thing as Harry keeping his sexuality (and ergo his preferences in all things that have ties to his sexuality like clothes and such)?

Or what exactly does cisgendered mean?

I get a lot about the noun "cisgender" when I google, but close to nothing on the adjective.

**** Cisgender means that you think your gender is the same as you got assigned at birth. For example: You think yourself as a female and were born as one. (Or you think that you are a male and were born as male.)

As opposed to transgender where you think of yourself as another gender as the one you were assigned at birth. (You think of yourself as a female but were born as a male.)

The adjective is essentially when you apply these terms to a person: A cisgendered Harry Potter => A Harry Potter who does think he's male and was born as one.

Actually this topic is complicated, I'm sure I just got it wrong. [[https://youtu.be/V9QnnQN880o][Maybe this YouTube video helps]]

***** Long story short, cisgendered means that your gender and sex are “the same”. So if you have a male body and think yourself a man, you are cisgendered; likewise, if you have a female body and think yourself a woman, you are cisgendered. So yeah, you didn't really get it wrong; maybe didn't give a complete description as a Harry Potter with a female body who thought herself female would also be cisgendered, but outside of that bit which is not really an error you didn't get it wrong.

Though gender identity is not really a binary thing so it all gets really funky once you try to analyse it all in-depth.

In which Harry Potter is born Hera Potter. I just started reading it and it only has 3 chapters so far. It's a Snape/Hera eventual pairing but I am assuming since she is still so young it's not happening anytime soon.
