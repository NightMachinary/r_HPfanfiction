Not knocking anyone or their preferences - I just don't get it. Isn't the plot more important...?


** Quite a lot of it tends to be plot related. For better of for worse certain pairing seem to bind themselves to certain types of stories. FFN doesn't have the monstrosity that is the AO3 tagging system and the main way to search fics other than asking for recommendations here is to search by characters involved. If I wanted a politics fic I might look for a Harry/Daphne fic. Its probably trash but its more likely to contain pureblood politics and a heavy involvement in traditions than any other pairing. Harry/Ginny is often a canon rewrite or canon themed sometime post canon. Harry/Susan tends to be competant ministry through her aunt Amelia. Harry/Tonks tends to have an independent Harry growing up quickly and looking to leave Hogwarts. Harry/Fleur often has the most varied plot lines but it tends to be super Harry gets super babe.

*** Harry/Daphne fics can be the most trashy or the most masterfully written. That's cause it is a pairing often abused. And most of the times it is ruined by the same concept the fic tries to convey, politics. When you screw up how the politics system works in your fic, then no matter how much plot you put behind the reason for a pairing then the fic is still going to be of a lesser quality.

On the other hand we have a few rare Harry/Daphne fics that don't center on politics so much, such as "Runic Animagi". It's one of the best fics I have ever read and I do recommend it to anyone as it has lots and lots of humour.

PS: It features Dobby smoking a bong, and in a way that is totaly legit plotwise.

**** Now, I have never read, nor wanted to read this pairing. In fact my filter set up has Hermione and Snape in the without filter so it's not going to be a nice guess. I will give my expectations off the pairing alone. (Ignoring potential creepiness inherent in the pairing)

Some assumptions to begin with.

- The writer is sympathetic to both Snape and Hermione

- the writer relates to one or both of the characters

What do Snape and Hermione have in common, well they were both bullied. Hermione by Ron in first year and Draco after, Snape by James Potter and co. They are also both intelligent but poor socially. There is a difference between knowing the right thing and knowing when to say it. I assume that the writer shares this or at least relates to it.

With the idea that the writer and the characters are in a world hostile to them for simply being them I might assume that there is a small amount of self-righteousness. One of the common criticisms of H/Hr is that it's regularly preachy and comes across as 'fixing' things, often in a way that sets up the characters and author to pat themselves on the back about how clever they are. With a wand up their backside and Snape's past as a Death Eater you might find they justify Dark magic or at least destruction.

With a sense of self-righteousness and a world against them but we're on their side so I would guess the plot has them vs the world either tearing down the wizarding world and its bigotry or leaving it. With their minds you might even have involvement of muggle science. Either way I expect an insular us vs them story with a 'clever' solution to 'solve' the world or leave it.

*** I don't necessarily agree with this. I mean, every single component in a fic is significant. Even if romance isn't the primary focus of an action/adventure story it's still really important that what romance there is us portrayed well. If you don't like a particular pairing, either because of the pairing itself or because of the way the author portrays it, it can really ruin the overall reading experience.

There was this one HP fic I read ages ago that was marked as gen but wasn't--halfway into the story (it was maybe 200k overall?) Harry started developing feelings for an OFC. The romance was just a minor subplot, but the OFC was such an unlikable character that I just couldn't ignore it. It didn't help at all that she and Harry had such a dull dynamic. It got to the point that I was skimming over all the romantic bits just so I continue reading an otherwise good fic.

So yeah, I'd argue that romance is extremely important regardless what the main genre(s) of a story are. I mean, EpicSolemnity's fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5402147/1/Death-of-Today][Death of Today]] is hardly a romance story but I know several people who won't go near it because of the pairing (Harry/Voldemort) even though romance (and I'm using that word very loosely because they're in no way romantic with each other) takes up like maaaaybe 10% of the entire 500K fic.

***** TBH, 10% would be stretching it. In the grand scheme of things, though, it's really not, especially when you take into consideration the fact that DoT isn't a typical romance story in that what constitutes for romance isn't all that romantic. Like, at all. Most of it is development for a potential relationship that, again, isn't particularly romantic. Or sexual.

I guess it also depends on the reader since I personally don't think 10% is unreasonable. It's still only a tenth of the overall story. Unless the fic features an already established pairing (or a pairing that's soon to be established) anything less would be a huge indicator that the romance aspects haven't been developed well and are likely to feel inorganic and +half-assed+ lackluster.

Have you ever read the /Song of the Lioness/ series by Tamora Pierce? I think that's a great example of a story that contains elements of romance (the protagonist forms attractions, has relationships, gets married, etc) but isn't really a romance. It wouldn't be considered "gen" by any means (nor would DoT) but it would still predominantly be an action/adventure/fantasy story.

I guess what it boils down to is how the romance bits are portrayed.

Also it's like 2AM so this probably makes zero sense.

** !) The original series lacked strong romantic stories. The main ships were barely covered in depth (we never actually see much of either Ron/Hermione or Harry/Ginny once they get together). So people like to fill the blanks or flesh out the characters more.

2) Many people were not happy with the pairings in canon so they want to write their own.

3) As others have said, people just like romance. We can't relate to the crazy life Harry lived, but we can all relate to the trials and tribulations of relationships. These stories make Harry and others feel more real.

** Well, it depends IMHO and the right pairing kind of influences the plot quite a bit!

Pairing Harry with a plotting/scheming Slytherin certainly changes things, because if the Slytherin is her own person and not just an extension of Harry that looks pretty and offers sex then she would probably SCREAM bloody murder when Harry tries to be extremely self-sacrificing and not caring about his image etc. (while a Gryffindor would probably see those qualities as noble and right!)

There's also the fact that certain pairings (at least to me!) make no sense what so ever (Harry/Draco - Hell, slash with Harry in general! Or almost worse: Hermione/Draco (sorry, but even post Hogwarts Draco would probably not touch Hermione that way, hell as far as I see it Draco remained a rich snob who should IMHO rot in Azkaban! Look at who he married: A "perfect" pureblood who's younger than he is, so he can probably boss her around etc.)...or Ginny/Draco (come on that's not Romeo and Juliet! We know that their families hate each other, hell worse: Draco's dad was the one who slipped the diary to Ginny and his deatheater friends killed one of the twins - sorry, but Ginny would probably rather kill Draco than have a relationship with the blond asshole!))
