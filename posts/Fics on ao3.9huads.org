Are there any okay (can't say “good”, cause someone will say there aren't any good) fics on ao3 with either betrothals, lord Potter, good Malfoys, manipulative dumbledore, bashing or any of the other tropes everyone loves to hate? I feel like I've read everything there is on ff.net.

Only criteria I have is no Harry/Ginny, Harry/Voldemort or Harry/Snape. Please over 100 k wording (at least not under 60k), and hopefully finished.

And before someone tells me to search for myself, searching on ao3 is like walking into an uncontrolled zoo.

Thank you!


** Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions linkao3(10588629), which I just read, has a mostly canon Harry who takes a liking to potions class. And not "Harry is immediately a genius at potions because he looks at a textbook", but rather Harry is bad at potions and just really likes it and want to get better. There's some minor Harry/Ginny mutual crushes on each other, but no actual relationship. Funnily enough, the ending and the sequel start to get into Cursed Child stuff, which I usually hate, but this makes it work

Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run linkao3(7331278) is great. It's just under 100k, Draco/Harry slash, and a mix of humor and seriousness from what I remember. It also has one of the best summaries I have ever seen in fanfic.

Holly at Hogwarts linkao3(1048010) is a next-gen fic starring an OC, Dudley Dursley's magical daughter. There are quite a few problems I have with this series (mis-sorted canon characters, some very blatant "all people in this house are X" stereotyping taken seriously in the world, the writing can drag on a bit, the main character has some issues that haven't been fully addressed), but I genuinely still enjoy it. There's been quite a few fun things that recaptured the magic of the original books for me. (Several of the issues I have with the series also get much better or at least more nuanced in the later books). There are 7 finished books (one taking place over a long summer adventure), and the author is currently figuring out what to do with seventh year.

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.

** I can second the opinion that AO3's search function is a mess. It's more like if the website ignores your search input and just says: "Here have some smut, badly written slash and some crossovers, even if you just want to see some simple fanfic you searched the title and author of."

** Linkao3(Other People's Choices) kind of fulfils some of your criteria. It has a sequel which just started posting. The premise is: when the storing hat falls on Harry's head in the CoS he is resorted into Slytherin. Snape becomes his mentor.

  AU. The Sorting Hat doesn't just let the Sword go when it falls on Harry's head in the Chamber, but also Sorts him again, this time into Slytherin. Harry is furious and terrified, and the adults aren't helping much.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648]]) could be to your liking. It's a Slytherin Harry story but not yet finished. But still 4 "books" completed and the fifth being actively posted is not bad

*** I actually just finished reading the first 4 books - there were some plot points I've never seen before and overall I found it an interesting read. The first book is 78k, 2nd and 3rd just over 100k each and the 4th ended up at over 200k.

There's manipulative dumbledore, Ron bashing and Lord Potter/Black although it doesn't seem to be as important as in some of the other stories. No real pairing so far but it doesn't look like it will be Harry/Ginny and I'm pretty confident saying it's definitely not going to be Harry/Voldemort or Harry/Snape.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.
