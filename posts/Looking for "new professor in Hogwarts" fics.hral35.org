I seem to be unable to find actually good fics which focus on a new professor in Hogwarts. Anything I find is either unreadable or abandoned with one chapter. The only good ones I read were one with Virgil from Devil May Cry and John Constantine from Hellblazer.

Please recommend fics you know of. I don't mind any pairings or crossovers. The only thing I can't stand is blatant extreme Mary Sui-ism. No "Harry professor" fics - I'm not interested in them.

  When Roy Mustang went to retrieve his eyesight from Truth, he wasn't expecting to end up doing a job in exchange. It couldn't even be an easy job, of course, because Edward's assessment of Truth was a pretty accurate one.

  When their muggle studies professor retires, Hogwarts decides to try something they've never done before: hire a muggle to teach muggle studies. Katie Harris is a muggle fresh out of school and looking for a job - any job. When she applies to teach at Hogwarts, she has no idea what she's getting herself into. But maybe, just maybe, it'll be the best decision she's ever made.
