** That's kinda hard because normally authors don't like to focus on a main ship just to change it up midway through. Still though, I like the idea, because very, very few people end up sticking with the first person we form a relationship with.

The only one I can think of that applies is What Lies Beneath. It's plot-focused and unfortunately for your request, is neither slash nor post-Deathly Hallows. However, according to the author, the main ship (Harry/Tracey) for much of the work is not the final ship. It is complete apparently, but I never got around to finishing it.

  COMPLETE. H/Tracey. The diary left more than battle wounds. Voldemort's ingenuity planned for more than Harry initially assumed. The time has come when he must pierce the shades of grey that colour the Wizarding World. A fast-paced, psychological thriller

** Closest I can think off is this oneshot linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5614414/1/His-Eyes]]). But even that is quite a longshot from your criteria.

  It's not hard to fall in love with Harry. Nor is it embarrassing. Just wish he loved you back. A Harry/Fleur oneshot.
