Saw a reference to the cartoon and thought it would be funny as a fic.

Snape vanished the contents of Neville's cauldron (why the latter brought it was anyone's guess) before it emitted more than a couple of puffs of smoke, and the couple of Dementors that Umbridge once sent after Harry, slouched and sulked.
