trying to read a story that I liked from the beginning, with interesting action and OC characters , and somewhere around chapter 30 the autor loses focus and puts up a chapter that is pages and pages of talk, uninteresting talk and exposition, and then when the chapter ends adds on another thousand words of explanation what the chapter was about.. Another story I was reading I got to chapter 19 of 21 and deleted it because it was just not going anywhere I wanted to go. I want the time I invested in this back.


** Well, that's just something that happens sometimes when you lose interest in something that doesn't retain the quality you expected. I can't count the number of television shows I've stopped watching, or the amount of books I've stopped reading, or even movies I've switched off partway through because they've just gone downhill.

This isn't something individual to fanfic, man. This is just a fact of consuming media.
