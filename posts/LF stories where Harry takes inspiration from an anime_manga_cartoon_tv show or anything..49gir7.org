*** This story starts out so good and devolves so fast and so hard its crazy. I loved it the first two chapters, but by the point that Draco becomes a Sorcerer (Jedi/Sith) because Hermione doesn't understand operational security I hated it.

** linkffn(Fairy Tail By Araceil)

This fits what you are asking for to a t. It's listed as a crossover, but it actually addresses only the HP world and characters. Unfortunately though, it looks abandoned.

  When Dudley throws a book at his cousin's head, no one could have known the revolution it would spark in the years to come. "I want to start my own Guild! My own family!". No pairing.

#+begin_quote
  Harry takes inspiration from a manga called Fairy Tail, as well as the great creation we call "The Internet". What follows is a different path taken. A path of strife, rebellion, and above all, power. Welcome to the New Age. Timeline moved to the 2010s. Eventual X-over with Devil May Cry 3, Stargate: SG-1, Smallville, Dresden Files and Ranma.

  A 7 year old Harry stumbles on a box of old Naruto manga. Inspired, he reaches deep within, using chakra to quickly become a phenomenal ninja. And thus begins a curious tale. Read and see how it ends! Read 1st chapter A/N...story is officially abandoned.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.
