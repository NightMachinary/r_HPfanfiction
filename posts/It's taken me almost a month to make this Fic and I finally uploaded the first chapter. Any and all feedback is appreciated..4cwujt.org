** Hermywormy, lol

Initially I thought it was another piece of Ron-bashing H/Hr garbage, but then I saw you wrote it. Upvote!

** This was shit. It was too long and I had to quit halfway through when Harry still hadn't outwitted Dumbledore or made friends with a goblin.

** Best story. I left a review but I'll post here too. You shouldn't use characters names at the end of dialog, you should put something like 'bushy haired beauty'. Not doing so shows your poor quality of writing.

** Naturally of course, we already have someone who took the fic seriously.

/"I don't know whether to cringe or not ... ://

*I'll admit, the story was actually pretty funny (when you could read what it said), but the spelling was ATROCIOUS.

/Reading this makes me want to claw out my eyeballs at the complete lack of respect towards the English language."/

It gets to a point where it's just scary.

We now have a second reviewer that makes me question everything.

/"Not too bad, but I prefer Robst"/

Fucking kill me.

This next one is my favourite

/"Not cool :("/

he sounds so innocent and genuinely upset.

We have another that is so informative and helpful.

/"NOOOOO DRARRY 4 Life"/

And holy fuck, this reviewer just roasted me!

/"gr8 b8 m8 I r8 8/8"/

I better stack up on burn heal.

Ok, this one is beyond a joke.

/"Better than canon by a large margin"/

It's so perfectly full of unwarranted self-importance!! Brilliant bit of satire.

** This was amazing, perhaps too amazing. Have you considered pulling it off the web and shopping it around to a few publishers? just change it to post apocalyptic setting and you will be rich.

** I know I'm going to get (probably deserved) shit for this, but I did cringe. Not because I took the fic seriously, but for the fact that there are people out there who think this type of weak parody is actually funny.

Incredibly, it's still better than a good 80% of fics out there.
