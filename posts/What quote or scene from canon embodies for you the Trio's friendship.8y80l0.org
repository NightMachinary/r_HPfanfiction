For me is when Hermione is explaining to Ron and Harry about what a Horcrux really is, and how if she were to stab Harry with a sword, his soul would still be intact. Ron's and Harry's response, combined with Hermione's willingness to both teach and learn stuff to help them, and just their chemistry feels just perfect.


** When Ron and Hermione laugh at the idea of Ginny telling gossipers that Harry has a Hungarian Horntail tattooed to his chest, and Harry immediately retorts by asking her what's Ron got.

This good-natured teasing is just, fun.

In the films, when Ron & Hermione are like proud parents when Harry talks about kissing Cho
