One scene that's always stuck with me from Half-Blood Prince is when Harry sits with Neville and Luna in the train compartment, and Luna comments how people expect him to have cooler friends. I like those two very much as characters, but they always seemed to be on the periphery of other people's friendships. Harry, being who he is, is kind to them, but doesn't actively seek out their company. This translates to most fanfics as well, so I don't think I've ever read a fic that portrayed a real friendship with them instead of the main cast. Give me whatever you've got.

** I'm Not The Only One comes to my mind. It's a Harry/Hermione AU story where Harry is the younger half brother of the BWL. Luna and Neville are his best friends. linkffn(I'm Not The Only One by Potato19)
