I'm looking for a story, where either Harry or a new student uses unique type of magic. I don't mean same thing as HP verse only wandles etc., but totally different "school". D&D, The Elder Scrolls, WoW etc. Can be totally new one, or taken from other books, movies, games.

I don't mind dimension/plane hopping by Harry or the new guy.

Good example would be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]]

  When Dudley throws a book at his cousin's head, no one could have known the revolution it would spark in the years to come. "I want to start my own Guild! My own family!". No pairing.

** Linkffn(school spirit by storyenvy), but too bad it hasn't been updated in a long while. It takes the magic of the Dresden Files series (more crossovers from this series please) and applies it and its concepts in the HP verse by Potter through an insteresting way.

  Harry Potter wasn't surprised to learn he was a wizard. He'd been dreaming of wizards and magic for years. He was just surprised at what sort of wizard he was. Prologue is identical to "Death and Dreams". Dresden Files crossover.

** In this crossover with K----(?) Hitman Reborn, fem!Harry starts learning 'soul' magic and teaching her friends it in fourth year. Linkffn(black sky by umei no mai) it's illegal in Britain because any magic involving the soul is considered dark magic there.

  When you're a Black, you're a Black and nobody gets to hold all the cards except you. Not a Dark Lord with a grudge, not a Headmaster with a prophecy and certainly not the world's most influential Mafia Family... Dorea is as much a Black as a Potter and she is not about to let anybody walk over her! A Fem!Harry story. Slow Build.

*** Is the MC supposed to be fem!harry? I thought she was just a self insert, given the level of fan wank that that story is. I'm still following it with baited breath, but I have no delusions about its trope score.

**** Supposedly she is, at least according to the synopsis.

And I do believe the term is “OC stand-in”.
