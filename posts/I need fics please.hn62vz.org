For the past five months I've stayed away from the fandom, but I'm getting back into it and need some fics to read. I mostly like to read slash and any Harry-centric

  [AU!] It started as a game. When two highborn lords come looking for a distraction from boredom, they merge the worlds of the highest class with those of the lowest class. An invitation sets things in motion that were supposed to stay locked away. Because a kingdom on the verge of collapse, a noble without a past and a circus performer with a secret are not a good combination.

** I just finished The Secret Language of Flowers and it's pretty dang good. Little heavy-handed on the "Everything is nice, but THEN EVERYTHING ABSOLUTELY WAS NOT." thing, but overall real interesting. Doesn't put much effort into redeeming 'old Dray-Dray, but it does okay with not making all the racist Nazis secretly good people.

Like a Ghost in my Town is one of two Harry-Voldemort fics I've actually enjoyed. If you don't enjoy the first one, you can skip it and move straight on to the second - it's a really great sequel in that it explains most of what happened in the first book without just exposition-recapping it all.

Linkao3(260551)

Hogwarts Crammer has Harry not ever going to Hogwarts and all the kids going over to find him later on when the war kicks off.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278]]

Linkao3(7331278)

And finally, Life Skills Outside the Curriculum, which is written by the same author as Language of Flowers and is markedly less Sad about everything. Homeless Harry on the streets (for a while) eventually gets joined by Draco. It's an interesting development arc for him, I gotta say.

  It was "Witch Weekly", of all people and organizations, the first to notice and comment on The Boy Who Lived's absence from the ranks of first years at Hogwarts. The magazine went on to elucubrate that the young hero was studying at a foreign school, possibly Beauxbatons or Holzschuhk√§se.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

  One tiny change makes all the difference in the world. When Harry discovers a small box in his vault during his first visit to Gringotts, he is hoping for a memento of his parents. Instead, his discovery starts him down a path of intrigue and suspicion. Not sure who he can trust, Harry will have to learn to rely on himself. Book 1 of The Cry of Freedom. Updates every Tuesday.
