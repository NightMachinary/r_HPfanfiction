** Trouble I had with this story is how OC the Order had to be. It wasn't believable in the slightest with what we know of them in the actual books. Weasleys throwing around the word Mudblood, Harry and Ron's actions, all Order actions, everything that made them villains.

*** Ugh, I agree with you completely. If you want to write an OC, write an OC. It's like the author wants to only use the goodwill of the community.

** Well. That was... Interesting. And, as the author's notes mentioned, rather dystopian.

I'm reminded of a statement that I heard from With This Ring, but it might have originally come from Terry Pratchett, that being the "good guys" is not like picking a team jersey, but rather depends on doing certain things and not doing certain others.

I can't respect this Harry, but I'm glad he survived.

*** I asked Colubrina about this fic one time and she said she was trying to write a story where the protagonist becomes the villain, and what she learned is that people who love the protagonist will find excuses or reasons to justify why the protagonist's choices were essentially correct.

Seems like a valuable life lesson, now that I think about it in the current political landscape. Ooh, that's uncomfortable.

** I thought this was an interesting and enjoyable read, Colubrina really knows how to get readers hooked from the first few chapters! Part 1's trajectory was more or less what I was expecting to read; I was more surprised by the direction of the plot in Part 2. I think the ending had a satisfying conclusion. This fic was structured well with an ensemble cast of characters.

I felt bad for Harry as the story neared the end - glad he and Hermione are in place where they can start to mend what had happened.

I loved the dystopian elements of this fic. One thing I thought could be explained more is why and how the Order got corrupted. It seemed like there was a thirst for revenge against Death Eaters and anything associated with them, but it doesn't completely explain the hedonistic vibe of post-War Order.

The way everyone slowly figured out the rumors about Hermione being pureblood were false was great. Basically everyone accepted the idea that blood wasn't such a big deal (well almost everyone). I like how this is a Dark Hermione story without blood supremacy.

Before reading this, the only fic by the author I had read was Rebuilding. Both featured roughly the same set of characters, but were entirely different in writing style and execution. I liked the action-packed suspenseful nature of this story, and I'll definitely be reading more Colubrina in the future!

** So, I just finished the first part. I hope I'll manage to finish it all before the month ends. Anyway, I figured I'll write a comment now, and another when I finish it all.

I've seen that most of the discussion here is about "what is good?", So I'll start with the end; Hermione's election speech and the hint that it is based on a famous speech of the 20th century. So... my guess is Hitler. (Before I trigger everyone, let me say that I'm Jewish with European roots, so half my family was murdered.) So, Hitler's speech - he was right. Germany was in shambles, and it was the fault of his predecessors. Not to mention that he did fix their economy (before starting ww2). So, overall, he became a dictator and took care of his people. Can you imagine how history would've remembered him if he didn't start his rampage? As we see only one pov, we can only assume that also Hermione is, indeed, right. Is she a bad person for violently starting a coup? History says "not if she succeeds". They that started the French Revolution aren't "monsters", they that took down Mussolini aren't "murderers" and so forth. Maybe my modern view can't see monarchy as better than democracy - so I'll forgive her for wanting to be a monarch, but only if she really does have the people's best interest at heart. I'm not sure she does. Lastly, and the reason why she's bad: It doesn't have to be a physically violent coup. She didn't have to torture that poor woman, she didn't have to kill (and torture) Ginny.

Sometimes you have to do bad things in order to be good. Yet, being good means doing bad things only when there's no other way.

** Meta: It might be an idea to do this book club every 2 weeks instead of every month? Most people I think who would be interested in the selected fic will probably already have read it, or read it in the first week.

** Thoroughly enjoyed reading, quality writing. Thanks!

The foreshadowing for what Ron would do made for an anxious read up until that point - I'm not talking about what he himself says in conversation, but things like Draco or Hermione saying "I don't know what I would do if anything happened to him". My only nitpick would be that the the death of their baby didn't come as more of a surprise.
