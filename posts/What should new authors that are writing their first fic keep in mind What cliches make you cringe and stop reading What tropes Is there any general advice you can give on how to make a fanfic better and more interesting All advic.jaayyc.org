** Proportionality. Characters should be in character. Be wary of soap opera drama if you haven't built to reactions. Also, be subtle with dialogue. Let the reader pickup on clues, they are generally smarter than you as an author will give them credit for.

Tropes? For me there is little off the table. If Harry is a Lord of Everything, or a super powered creature, or taught by the founders... Don't forget where your tension is coming from. Where is the conflict? Let's say you have a super powered Harry, but it creates a certain flaw, whether in character or whatever. If you resolve that flaw, and then have the story default back into 'defeat Voldemort' after that tension is resolved, the story will be boring. Unless you introduce new issues. 'Defeat Voldemort' can be a subplot in your story.

As for advice, the best advice I hear is generally from a fourth wall break saying /looks at you/ WRITE. Stop procrastinating. Get off social media. Why are you still reading this? Every second you put into writing will improve your writing, even if you don't notice. It's a craft. Get your advice, and then get to it. üëçüòÅ

** I'm not an author, so I don't know if this advice is valid, but I think fanfic authors should focus on the story /they/ want to read. For most of them, fanfics are just an hobby, not a job, and ultimately, things like a fic popularity do not matter when compared to the potential enjoyment of writing. But it is also true that some aspiring author use Fanfictions as a form of training to hone their skills, and I guess these people have a different point of view.

Now, I don't think an author should stop himself from using any cliche or trope if he wants to, because tastes differ. I may hate "Magical Core" and "Lord Harry" with a passion, but I know that some people enjoy them, just like I enjoy some tropes they probably enjoy.\\
That being said, tropes should be used in moderation, if only to write a story that is not the carbon copy of something already existing. I don't really have anything against prompts such as "/Harry discovers that Dumbledore always manipulated him with the help of his friend, but with the help of the Slytherin Ice Queen, he will learn how to navigate the Pure Blood Culture and create his own side as a Grey Wizard",/but that's the kind of story I'm pretty sure I have already read (50 times), so I doubt I would even bother starting it. In the same way, Canon Rehash is generally disliked on this sub.

** One cliche that really gets to me is all the fanciful lord speak bullshit, stuff like "So Mote it be" and "Well met" its just so overused and never really serves a point except for trying and failing to make the characters appear "cultured". Blood Purity apologism is another one I've seen overused, that's terrible. And as a big Ron defender, if I even get a hint of there being any bashing I'm out, although I have noticed that people just tend to write him out of the story instead of bashing him.

What I would suggest is that you do familiarise yourself with what is actually canon and what is fanon, its your choice what to include in the end, but you should know which is which.

*** Personally I like the subversion of the ‚Äúoverly political teens‚Äù where the adults say ‚Äúoh yes you must bow just so when meeting an heir of a pureblood family‚Äù and such but it's just an elaborate hazing ritual that's been going on for the past four-five generations

**** I dont think I've read any fics that have used that subversion, what I wouldnt mind seeing though is a fic that completely mocks the idea of overly political teens. For example it could show Harry, Ron, and Hermione actually acting like teenagers and having fun, while all the Pureblood children are completely boring themselves to death trying to make alliances, which could turn out to be completely pointless once they leave school. Or do the whole Pureblood heir tries to show Harry how to properly act, only for Harry to go "fuck off mate".

** I think the biggest thing to remember is that cliches and tropes /are not plot./ You can't just dump tropes in and expect it to be a story.

Cliches and tropes are cliches and tropes for a reason. You're not going to get away from them. That said, you shouldn't /write/ cliches and tropes. Your writing will contain them, but you shouldn't seek them out.

Also, how much personality a character has should be directly proportional to the amount of time they spend in the story. A random shopkeeper in Diagon that the story interacts with once doesn't really need a personality. A dorm mate that the MC talks to every couple of chapters should be more than just a cardboard cutout roughly shaped like a student.

This kind of ties in with Chekov's Gun - the more detail you pour into something, the more the reader is going to assume that something is actually important. So if you pour a ton of detail into a character, a location, an object or whatever and then it just kinda never gets mentioned again? That's incredibly unsatisfying. The inverse is also true, if something incredibly important and is barely sketched out that's also incredibly unsatisfying.

** Good writing is writing that is easy to understand.

Bad writing is writing that makes it hard to understand.

Good writing is not using all the words you know in order to prove how clever you are. Focus on making sure what you have written can be understood. People might skim over simple writing, but it helps highlight the meaningful stuff. Spend more time building your world, more time fleshing out your characters and less on searching through a thesaurus.

There is nothing new under the sun. Your story idea probably isn't that original, in a lot of ways what your story is about when summed up in a couple of sentences won't be that different to a hundred other stories and that's okay. Don't try too hard to make something new and interesting for the sake of being new and interesting. Make it good. One of the most important things is to know when to stop, when to say enough is enough. People might not hate Harry finds stuff left in his vault by his parents, people will hate Harry finds stuff left to him by Merlin, the Hogwarts founders, Santa, Luke Skywalker and a Harry the time traveller. It is too much. It might sound new and interesting but taking a step back it seems dumb.

When working in someone else's sandpit be aware of the rules. Harry Potter magic is pretty loose, that way JKR could get away with a lot. That doesn't mean there are no rules. As a rule of thumb ask yourself, if this idea is so brilliant why did nobody think of it before? You can create answers to that, people didn't do it because previously a limitation existed, that's pretty much how technology develops. People often had ideas long before it was possible to make. In Harry Potter this means stuff like wandless magic seems stupid, why would they spend 7 years at Hogwarts learning to use a wand if wandless was better? Why do even Dumbledore and Voldemort use wands if they're inferior? It just seems stupid and as if you think you're cleverer than you are. It makes people question you as an author which means they aren't thinking about the story and their emersion is broken, it can also piss people off, see the whole hyperspace ramming in Disney Star Wars. Applying this to the above example, if Harry inherited super powerful shit from Merlin, why didn't Lily and James use it?

** No one's early stuff is good, to write well you must first write poorly (a lot). The more you write, the better you'll get.

Start short. Long works are a lot of work to write and frustrating to not finish.

Know how you will end before you begin, otherwise you're ending won't be set up and will fall flat - or you'll just ramble on forever and quit before you end.

Get a couple of pre-readers, beta readers, and/or editors.

Be a pre-reader/editor for other people. This will help you think about writing at a more technical level, and make you look up stuff.

Editing tip: change the font, so it all looks new. This will help prevent you form glossing over flaws. (but still get another set of eyes on it.)

Your first million or so words aren't going to be great, but the more you write (and revise and edit), the better you'll get.

** I would say trim your writing and plan your timeline. It's not that I won't read a 350k fic, but a lot had better happen in that 350k. I'm consistently annoyed by fics that spend 40 to 60 chapters just to finish 1st year because they spent so much time describing things or adding in extra elements.

Since chapters are often posted one at a time, I think a lot of authors lose sight of the pacing of their own story. Time should pass in the story at more than a snail's pace. Authors that introduce time turners as an element often mess this up too, I've read fic's where 10 chapters record the events of a single day.

Just make sure to think about what you want to happen in a chapter or a set of chapters and prioritize description and dialogue. A lot of fanfiction can end up pretty bloated because there is no page or word limit like a published book would have and so authors don't consider what scenes really add to the story.

** One thing that always makes me think I'm reading a new writer's work is when they start their story/chapter with an interjection or exclaimation of some kind. Like another character yelling the protagonist's name, or a sound of some sort (bell ringing, birds, etc.). It's actually one of the things that's suggested to students writing in elementary school as a way to start a story so I've always associated it with young writers.

** Be in an expert in the thing you're going to write. If you want to make your character a seer or a potions master or a duelling champion you will have to know (and create because there isn't nearly enough in canon) the theories around divination, potions or duelling. You will have to create the theoretical boundaries in the respective fields and have a strong understanding of what that field is and is not in your story. Having your character say they're a prodigy in something is bad, having them show they are one is good but having them show they are in one in a story in which the reader actually understands what being a prodigy entails, is best. This isn't only about abilities or what. I always think having a strong understanding of the concepts in your story is key, example: if you're going to write about a certain era you have familiarise yourself with that time period. If you're going to write about Tom Riddle (born in the 20s) and your depictions of life in that time period is all kinds of wrong, your reader, who might know a bit of history, can't immerse themselves. Not to say you can't take liberties, they will just have to make sense in the broader context of your story.

** As an educator who works with kids age 5-18, the characterization of students of different ages is frequently very badly written. I often see characterizations of 1st-3rd year students that read more like anywhere from 6-8 year olds. I know that it can be hard to remember how you were as at a given age, but there are definitely guides out there written for educators about the emotional maturity of kids at different ages.

First years are 11 to 12 years old. In the US, that's 5th or 6th grade. At that age, kids are starting to learn who they are separate from their parents. Those who are so inclined are beginning to explore things like wearing makeup, fashion, trying out new hobbies, and more. They are beginning to explore their attractions to peers and dating, and may be beginning to rebel from their parents/teachers. They will likely get homesick from time to time, but they are much less free with their hugs to educators than say, a 5-7 year old, and they are very unlikely to hold hands with a teacher while walking around. (Something I've seen more than once.)

I'm late to this thread and doubt many more will swing by, so I'm not going to type much more just now unless anyone asks, but that's one of my big pet peeves.

** A trope that I honestly can't stand is mugglewank, you are reading/writing a story about magic, something that breaks almost every rule about science in the book, applying real-world science to it and then making it so muggle technology is inexplicable better makes absolutely no sense: no, transfiguration is not like nuclear fusion at all no matter how you turn it, the energy output and complexity of the chemical reactions that would be needed in the real world to turn a match into a needle are beyond imagination, the H-bomb does not even come close to comparison; apparatation, space-expansion charms, vanishing charms and portkeys each either break all our knowledge about how space-time works or are world-ending terrifying if you try to apply physics to them; the fidelius, Horcruxes, dementor's and who knows what else all deal with souls and/or metaphysical philosophical concepts as if they were concrete things - no /'rational'/ explanation for it and magicals do not get their powers from genetic mutations, this is just not how biology work and hearing again and again about a supposed /'M-gens'/ gets annoying really, /really/ fast.

As for advice I would say to develop the nuances of the world-budding and magic-system before starting to write (using reason to think about how a reasonable population would react to everything (wandless magic at seven is not bad by itself, having your MC be the only one able to do it while using it better than everyone else uses their wands on the other hand makes absolutely no sense) and giving deeps to your character, even if it doesn't get put explicitly in the story, to help guide what choices they make and /why/ (Dumbledore is seeking power? Fine, why does he wants it, and what does he plan to do with it? Isn't the power he already have enough for whatever his end goal is? He wants to steal from Harry's family vault? Ok, so what is he doing with the money -you can't say war-costs if he already has everything he uses to fight the war and isn't making purchases to help; why didn't he just steal from his political job if he was so money-hungry (remember that if he is so against corruption he should take steps to curb it beyond just not partaking in it himself)? and why is Harry so rich? Wealth can only be accurately measured in comparison with other's wealth so in comparison to the Malfoys and Weasley's, where does Harry's family stand and how did they get there? Fame does not immediately equate richness, you know) and last of all, do not follow blindly cannon, the characters actions should have consequences to the plot, you can't have Harry finding out the monster is a Basilisk in one chapter just to have him going into the Acromantula colony the next to ask what is the monster for example. Last advice I can give is to try not to create baseless and needless angst, conflict between characters is enjoyable when done right and having a character be affected by something they went through makes them more human, but humans are also capable of a wide spectrum of emotions, having a character who is continuously putting himself down while doing mind-blowing achievements is extremely annoying and having a character just up and picking a fight with the MC despite them being in a position that should generate positive feelings between them makes no sense.

** Keep it short and to the point. I, for one, skip most paragraphs that involve unnecessarily long dueling scenes if the fight could be over with one spell (JK did a good job about that and the only lengthy duel in the series - between Dumbledore and Voldemort - is really interesting because it's not just people yelling incantations and dodging colored flashes of light) or long quidditch games if there is nothing actually happening (say someone cursing the protagonist's broom or the balls or Dementors swarming the pitch). I don't mind long stories but I would like each paragraph to have a purpose and not be there just for the word count. If you want to reintroduce the reader to an already known world, make sure you do it in a new and interesting way because we already know from the original series Harry's perception of it.
