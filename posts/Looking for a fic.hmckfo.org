:END:
Hi! This fanfic has been in my head for a while and I can't find it: I think it's Harry/Hermione with Dumbledore Bashing

Dumbledore tried to promote muggle stuff like pencil/pen and paper and show how wonderful they are and how they can live together without the secrecy laws

Harry / Hermione think that the secrecy laws shouldn't go away

He sends Arthur Weasley to go learn about the Muggle World and Arthur comes back saying how awful it can be and talks about bombs, nuclear weapons, war and guns

Dumbledore disagrees and i think either ignores him or tells him he that it's for the greater good
