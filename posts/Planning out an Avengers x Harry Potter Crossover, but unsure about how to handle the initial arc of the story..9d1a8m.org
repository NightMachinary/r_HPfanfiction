** I'd suggest bumping it up to his fifteenth birthday. Then he could wish to get away from all the bad stuff that happened in June of 1995. It would also give more magic to play around with, because a 13 year old Harry hardly knows shit.

#+begin_quote
  Like, should he be found by the police and sent to an orphanage when they can't find any records of him?
#+end_quote

Not appealing, in my opinion.

#+begin_quote
  Does a camera catch him casting magic, and he ends up getting brought into Shield (or some kind of mutant facility--I heard X-Men is apart of MCU).
#+end_quote

Sounds boring.

#+begin_quote
  Does Peter Parker stumble upon Harry during his rounds around the neighborhood fighting crime?
#+end_quote

This could be interesting, especially if this is a teenager Peter. Harry & Peter friendship sounds pretty cool.

**** I love HP/MCU crossovers in general, and I'd love to see Harry become Spiderman's sidekick. Maybe Harry goes to live with Peter and Aunt May?

*** Sorry for the short reply earlier, I was in a setting inappropriate for extended phone use! But I wanted to make sure to say at least thank you!

Firstly, thanks for your evaluation of the three different "paths", so to speak. I also think the Peter route is the most interesting and probably the most least done (if that wording makes sense). At the very least, I haven't seen it much yet.

Secondly, I'm a bit unsure about upping the age. Part of my decision in having Harry be 12-13 was his spell diversity would be smaller, which means he'd have to rely more on creativity and a greater mastery of the spells he would already reasonably have (not to say he wouldn't have awesome spells, a 2nd YR can feasibly know spells like the disarming charm, the memory charm, and a handy spell called Avifor, which turns a person into a bird; this could be considered the equivalent of a one-hit kill since there won't be many who can turn the bird back into a person).

Thank you again very much for your feedback, and I'll take it all into consideration!

**** I'd honestly drop a fic if a 13 yr old Harry used Obliviate or turned people into birds. It's too much. Hermione wasn't confident about using the spell at 17. Harry shouldn't be able to use it simply because he saw one in action. Same with the bird thing, too advanced for a third year.

Harry with only two years experience barely knows anything. Even at 15, he's still very much disadvantaged. Spidey would whoop his ass, for example. At 13, there's honestly squat he could do to really change anything. Especially when there's no more learning magic.

***** I can understand that, although all the spells I mentioned are actually part of the second year textbook for standard spells, so I wouldn't say they're too advanced. I also think spells are about the time spent mastering them. Like, at first Harry could probably only wipe every memory of an opponent (and not control which memory he's erasing), for example.

Thanks for all your perspective!

****** But Harry wouldn't know how to perform the spell in the first place. It's not simply pointing your wand and saying an incantation all the time. And the source for that is the CoS video game, which not only isn't canon but directly contradicts canon. Here's a quote from Goblet of Fire:

#+begin_quote
  Of course, the ideal solution would be for you to Transfigure yourself into a submarine or something,” Hermione said. “If only we'd done human Transfiguration already! But I don't think we start that until sixth year, and it can go badly wrong if you don't know what you're doing. . . .”
#+end_quote

So they don't even start that until sixth year. I dunno. Feel free to do it, but it'll probably break reader's suspension of disbelief.

**** u/FFCheck:
#+begin_quote
  2nd YR can feasibly know spells like . . ., the memory charm, . . .
#+end_quote

You are using some extremely AU 2nd YR if this is your claim. There is absolutely no indication that a 2nd YR can actually /wipe someone's memory/ that would be actually insane if possible in canon. Being mentioned in a spellbook doesn't mean a thing because we don't know if it's a reference or actual instructions.

#+begin_quote
  handy spell called Avifor, which turns a person into a bird
#+end_quote

Yea I'm like 99% sure that isn't right. Human Transfiguration is N.E.W.T level. The 1st/2nd year spell, Avifor, is likely used on inanimate objects. Disarming is a known actual 2nd year canon spell that is taught. Avifor and Memory Charm are unknown, but if Avifor is not Human Transfiguration, it is believable. Memory Charm is just so unbelievable it would take a ton of people out of the story without some magic backstory explanation on why he knows/is good at it.

I agree above that for the story, you should use a year 4 and up Harry. A 13 year old Harry Potter in MCU with only 1st and 2nd year down might as well just be a kid name Harry Potter with zero ties to HP world. A 15+ Harry you can at least explain away a lot of the spells he knows as prep for AU somewhat insignificant Triwizard Tournament. A 16 year old might even be better for a post-Sirius, let me get away, mindset.

The Peter Parker route would be pretty good and put them in approximately the same age range if you age him up. Honestly you could have Tony send Peter over because it wouldn't be outside the realm for Tony to have detected some sort of dimension breach and not being in the area to handle it.

I could understand a SHIELD too because it is extremely unlikely that they don't detect some sort of dimension breach, post-Avengers 1.

If you're stuck on the initial, take what you have now, and work backwards. "What is a logical way to have had Harry placed into this situation." If you already know who Harry is going to know/be friends with, how is he going to know that person/group. Work through there to figure out your initial "alone in the big city in a different dimension" arc. Make it the intro arc more or less.

ETA: You're going to need some way to integrate HP into the world with forged documents. With using already introduced MCU characters, Shuri/Tony/SHIELD are probably the best bet tbh. It really depends on where into MCU you're willing to insert HP. Given you mentioned Peter, I'm guess around Post-Civil War at minimum, otherwise there is absolutely no Spiderman info pre-Civil War and it would require crafting a brand new backstory for MCU Spiderman for your story. The further back into MCU you go, the bigger divergence HP is going to have on the MCU storyline. Meeting Peter would be nice as both a new intro character for HP into MCU plus there's already a direct tie into Tony who can help forge documents and there's only so many movies left in which HP could actually alter the outcome of.

** If you're not sure how to make it work then consider changing it. Does Harry need to be so young? At that age he should be barely useful. Unless you're trying to explore the caring side of the other character by inserting HP then why does he need to be so young?

Harry Potter has never had a holiday, never been abroad. Considering how much he avoids attention, taking Harry post Hogwarts who just wants to get away makes sense and also provides with a competent wizard rather than a child who can't do anything and risks the trace for any spells.

** X-Men isn't currently in the MCU, although with Disney's upcoming acquisition of Fox it's planned to become part of it.

​

Well, where do you want to go? I'm also currently writing my HP/MCU crossover. I knew where I wanted to start (the end of Deathly Hallows) and where I wanted to go (through to the Thanos fight) so the start was pretty easy for me. To plan out you have to have a rough idea of the beginning and end. The in-between is a process of joining the two parts.

**** Sadly, not yet. Because I want to be sure I don't end up leaving people hanging with an unfinished story, I'm not going to start posting until I'm a little over halfway done with the entire story. I've finished like the first seven chapters, which incorporates the end of Deathly Hallows in three chapters (the Ancient One fights in the Battle of Hogwarts, heh) and time skips to some mutant stuff which is how Harry and Hermione end up being involved in broader MCU stuff (I merged some X-men things into the MCU; wizards aren't mutants but there's a debate about whether wizardkind should assist mutants). Last I remember, I had Heimdall bringing Harry and Hermione to Asgard because Harry being Master of Death allows him to permanently avoid his vision (other stuff too, but that's what motivates initial Asgardian interest).

Sorry! I hate to titillate with nothing yet to show for it. :(

** Most HP/Avengers (or more generally MCU) crossovers tend to have him meet Tony Stark/Iron Man or Bruce Banner/Hulk. I really like your idea of him befriending Peter Parker/Spider-Man instead---there's lots of possibilities there, what with the closer age range.

They could be friends instantly or actually be antagonistic to each-other (well, at least when not donning the metaphorical cape); they could work together to keep their abilities hidden or have no idea about the other's skills; there could even be some sort of love triangle involved. Endless possibilities! I'm excited to see where it goes.
