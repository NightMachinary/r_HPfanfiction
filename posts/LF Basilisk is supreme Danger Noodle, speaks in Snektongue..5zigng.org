Am sad though. Lots of Harry Potter stories with sneks. But fanfics never get dialect right. Sneks not speak like sneks.

Do u have fics with proper Snektongue? I would be happy snek to read fic with biggest Danger Noodle and properly Snek language.

Would also be happy snek to read Doge Padfoot. So animagus. Much escape from Azkaban. Such dementors. Do want.


** Yes hello snek am also snek welcom to fanfiction subreddit. Sorry but not very much snek fanfiction. Am many sad but maybe you can boop your snoot on keyboard and write story for megamoodle Basilisk?

Edits: All hail the Great Snek, lord of all noodles in Snekworld

** Okay, this is my first time doing this, so I hope it works... lol

linkffn(Getting Away by fringeperson) has a good amount of Padfoot. linkff(A Sound Like Serpents Singing by Lomonaaeren) has snake stuff. It's not exactly realistic Parsletongue dialect, though, and it doesn't feature the basilisk. linkao3(Welcome Home by orphan_account) has some Padfoot. linkffn(The Games We Play by Respite88) is probably exactly what you want with Parsletongue dialect and Basilisk, but it's only 15k and incomplete (and probably won't be updated). linkffn(The Dog and His Boy by rhyejess) has a lot of Padfoot.
