:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Three months since my last thread and no answer! Someone did say they also read the same story though, but never got a follow up if THEY found out either. :(

So here we go.

So. This fic I'm searching for: Sirius and Remus are involved with Snape taking care of Harry, and Draco tries to kill Harry by pushing him down the grand staircase at Hogwarts under the Imperius, Harry has jealousy issues about Draco and Snape, and they spend Christmases together. One Christmas, his scar goes nuts and Sirius and Remus are there and start freaking out over Harry being in pain.

Harry and Ron are under the cloak in fourth year, and then Fake-Moody shows up and kills Dobby in front of them. Ron runs away to get help, and Harry gets taken to the Graveyard. Snape is in Dumbledore's office and has to listen to Harry get tormented through some magical stone or a mirror, possibly.

Can anyone help me find this one, please?


** I know this fic, but can't remember it on top of my head. Perhaps Other People's Choices? Can't verify atm.

**** It is a very good suggestion bc many people who like Severitus/Snape-adopts-Harry fics also ship Harry/Snape (just not in the same fic).

***** You're telling me to chill? What's YOUR problem? You come onto my post saying shit about "Go try slash!" when this isn't a slash fic I'm looking for. You're the one in the wrong.

******** a) people who read slash don't just read slash. Sorry if that comes as some kind of rude awakening to you.

b) Snappedsnale was probably suggesting that if someone in this sub doesn't get your answer, someone in that sub - who doesn't subscribe to this sub - may know the fic not that the fic is slash or that you are a (horrors!) slash reader.

c) get up off your fainting couch, Ophelia.

******** Yeah oddly enough I think I found this story through the HPSlash reddit (along with many others that aren't slash). I'll look through my bookmarks and see if I can find it but I know I gave up on it so I probably won't find it.
