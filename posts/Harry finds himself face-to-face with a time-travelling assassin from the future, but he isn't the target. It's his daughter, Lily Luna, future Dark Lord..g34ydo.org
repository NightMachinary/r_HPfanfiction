** It reminds me of some story where some woman is told that she has to kill her baby son because he'll grow up into a man that will destroy much of the world and rule the ashes. Her response is to tell her son to burn them all for daring to ask a mother to kill her child.

*** Well, my response would be to tell any children I had to stay safe then do the burning myself (Cassus belli: End Threat), but I understand the sentiment and the story sounds like something I'd like to read.

If not too inconvenient, could you share a link/set of keywords?
