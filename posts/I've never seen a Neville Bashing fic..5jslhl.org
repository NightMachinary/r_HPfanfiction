** I've seen many, either he's an asshole BWL, or he isn't important enough of a character to merit more than a few lines of bashing.

The former is just him slowly becoming a joke to the wizarding community by being an asshole who can't actually do anything.

The latter usually is Harry going apeshit at some point after fourth year because Neville either didn't help introduce Harry to the wizarding world, side with Harry in second year after he is ostracized for being a parselmouth, or side with Harry in the tournament after accusations of cheating and therefore didn't uphold the Potter-Longbottom alliance.

** The closest I've found is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5503587/1/Ghost-of-You][Ghost of You]], an angsty Harry/Ginny story that has its issues but is very engrossing and well-written.

Spoilers for how Neville is bashed:

[[/spoiler][Neville starts out sympathetic and a very close friend to Ginny, since they both went through that year of hell at Hogwarts together. He helps Ginny recover after a nervous breakdown of sorts. Harry gets a bit jealous of their friendship and everyone tells Ginny she is leading Neville on and he loves her. Eventually, Harry and Ginny break up and Neville takes the first opportunity to try to kiss Ginny, which she avoids. He tries again a few times and is overall the typical "nice guy is not so nice" cliche.]]

[[/spoiler][I found it a unique way to bash a character. As a Harry/Ginny fic, Neville serves as the wedge that could tear them apart. But he doesn't act poorly for the vast majority of the fic, so you don't like the character, but also have no legitimate reason not to like him except that he is an obstacle. The entire time, you build up a resentment to a perfectly pleasant character, and who doesn't love Neville? But then it's like a switch goes off and your irrational hatred of him gets rewarded. So I liked it. Plus, I'm sure any woman who was friends with a guy who secretly loved her probably can relate to a lot of the story.]]
