Either canon or post-war years. I've just read linkffn(Phoenix Insurgent) but I haven't found any more similar to this. In OOTP, Fudge is paranoid that Dumbledore will use the Order to move against him, so I'm surprised there aren't more "What if?" fics which portray something like that happening. It'd be interesting to read a fic which presents the Order as a political group with coherent goals beyond the defeat of Voldemort, maybe even a revolutionary secret society like the Jacobins or the Carbonari. As we all know, the Wizarding World is fraught with corruption and injustice which does not necessarily stem from Voldemort, so it would be nice to see this being tackled through direct conflict with those in power, rather than being glossed over in favor of a view which centers Voldemort as the source of all wrong-doing.

Now, fighting on two fronts against the Ministry and Voldemort, he finds himself in dire need of an ally. One who, like him, is a wizard of uncommon power and skill. Canon Departure from OotP. Gen.
