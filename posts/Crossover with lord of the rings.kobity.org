Happy New year everyone!

In the last days of 2020, I started reading these crossovers, especially ones with Harry/legolas (don't judge me, I know it's weird).

Do you have recommendations for crossovers? If it's with Harry/Legolas it's perfect, but I would read everything good


** The only lotr cross over I've read/reading. No pairing

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.
