I've always went by canon, though the logic is pretty flawed. Harry showcases a crush on Cho in PoA(he's 13 here)before the quidditch match against Slytherin. Cho says good luck to him and he blushes. He then asks Cho to the Yule Ball in GoF(14) , but he never really goes into a romantic relationship with anyone until halfway through OotP(15). Even then, Harry never really put much effort into it. He had a lot of things in his mind, so dating took a back seat.

I've legit seen fics where Harry lose his virginty at 14(guess who the female was), and it's just... weird. I'm fine with relationships like in canon; dates, short kisses and the lot, but I can't read about 14 year old kids having steamy make out sessions in a broom closet.


** Depends on the demographic. Depends on whether the area is low income/middle class/Rich

I gew up in a low income (and surbaban area around highschool) area where the average age to start having intercourse was as early as 13-14 years old (7th to 8th grade).

Then by the time High School came around 16 was around the age everyone lost thier virginity. And the vast majority of that was 16 year old girls going out with 20 year old dudes either already out of school or in college and often had thier own car. The others included dudes who got lucky in the backseat of a car or had thier girlfriend invite then over when thier parents weren"t home or were out of town.

Werent any house parties going on, if you threw one the entire block knew it and would tell the offending person's parents. It was a case of everyone knew everyone and would tattle so you had to do it somewhere remote or where no one knew you.

Sorry, got off track. The general consensus is about college aged (18+) because not everyone is comfortable enough (or want ) to read about kids banging, especially those who didnt grow up in an environment where that was considered normal.

Too early would be anything before 12. Thats unnatural and most boys that age cant stand being around girls that age unless he grew up with her. Around 13 (generally) hormones start making us stupid( which is why guys always have a crush on either their middle school or highschool teacher, depending on attractiveness) then anything goes.

*** Wow, this thread is really eye opening for me. I always assumed the average age was around 16-17 in developed countries. There was one kid in my school who lost his virginity at 13 everyone treated him like an outcast. I'm Irish, and we're still kinda prudish about sex, especially in rural areas.

I guess it really depends on the story you want to tell. Certainly unfitting for a classical romance, but "casual sex turning into something more" is not that uncommon in real life.

** Normal school romances are fine; 13's probably about right. But sexual stuff should, in stories, be saved til later (adults?) if not avoided altogether. Fanfic are mostly written by people with barely any dating or sexual experiences and that's made obvious in how they go about it.

For me, where canon failed (and where most fanfic fail even harder) is in the bits that fanfic often skips over: the pre-romance development. Well, hold on. HP canon did the friendships pretty well but not with any of its couples. The friendships were still believable and nice. But canon romance became a definite stinker in its execution. There wasn't hardly any indication beforehand that these couples could believably make things work romantically, the reader has do too much of the work to make it make sense. If the author (canon or fanfic) intends to write a realistic HS relationship then that's fine, because the reader knows it cannot last. But it usually just works in these stories even though it shouldn't. They haven't constructed the foundation to make it do so.

Fanfic nearly always has it twice as bad as canon, though. It rushes through the stuff before the relationship to get to the author's desired ship so it's less believable and less satisfying, AND the romance is stupidly done because they don't realize a relationship is more than kissing, fucking and sweet talk (lack of experience rears it's head here).

If the characters had a solid connection in canon, it's easier to gesture briefly at it in fanfic, but it still shouldn't be immediate. If I'm going to suspend disbelief I can't take seriously kids "being in love" and lasting with an HS relationship. And certainly not pining over a few weeks of one while the world is at stake. /not-so-subtle shade thrown

*** I'd make the argument that most sexual stuff should wait until the characters in question are at least 16, considering that that's the age of consent in the UK. Now, while I can imagine that an argument could be made that the age of consent might be lower in Magical Britain compared to it's Muggle counterpart; I can't imagine, for example, Muggleborn Hermione Granger or Muggle-raised Harry Potter being comfortable with the idea of that kind of physical intimacy at say 12 or 13.

It's not /completely/ inconceivable that there was a witch or wizard with a size kink at some point in the past who came up with a spell or potion or whatever to enlarge someone's, uh, /assets/. But that kind of background world building is definitely beyond the purview of most smut fics, at which point it veers back into ridiculous again.

*** The thing is, teenager romance often comes with little prelude. A friend of mine gatecrashed a random party where he knew no one and was together with the host (15 at the time) within four hours. They lasted for almost two years and did not begin with romantic gestures, but grinding and making out. A different friend got together with a guy because she wanted to know how French kissing a pierced tongue feels like.

Saying that Sex doesn't happen before adulthood is a lie. The average age for losing your virginity is 16 across huge parts of Europe, so for that to be average plenty of people start earlier.

Woah woah woah, that is definitely not what I said. What I said was that fanfic authors shouldn't write underage wizards having sex and falling in "true love" if they want it to be realistic. As I said, if they want to do a realistic HS relationship, have at it. Teens fuck all the time and even in the U.S. people fuck early. But in a fanfic it will probably be written poorly and I cannot take it seriously as evidence that the two are "in love". And it definitely isn't going to be clear path towards a lasting relationship. Even stories with my OTP that do this irritate me.

This seems silly. It's very fucking common for teenagers to /think/ themselves in love, and for the purpose of most fics that's the same as actually being in love.

Yeah epilogues where every school couple actually gets married eventually are silly, but to think that it doesn't actually happen at all is even sillier (I know half a dozen couples that started dating around 14 and made it to marriage and some parenthood already). One would also argue that sharing traumatic experiences would make relationships much tighter than teenager average too. It really doesn't strain my suspension of disbelief to see the main pairing of a fic lasting throughout, it's only an issue when /all/ pairings do that.

That is very fucking silly. The point is kids (even adults, but moreso for kids) can think themselves in love because they mistake wanting to be intimate with being in love (hello hormonal changes).

#+end_quote

It's a hell of a lot more complicated than what you seem to suggest. Such things can strengthen friendships, but if they were already somewhat iffy with each other (say, arguing often) then traumatic events are just as likely (if not much more so) to strain things once they don't have the outside opposition to motivate them looking passed their issues. And fanfic have the habit of not even trying to make the foundation for a long relationship exist, even in pairings I like.

You have a troubling habit of taking what I wrote and not responding to it. No, what I said was is that teenagers (and even adults, but teens moreso) can easily convince themselves that they are in love just because they are attracted to someone. Teens have little to no experience with relationships, so it's not exactly a mystery how this occurs. And fanfic authors do this routinely, it's extremely easy to find. And I'm not underestimating kids, kids are kids and by definition lack the time needed to develop experience and insight into these things.

It has nothing to do with tropes, the point is "One would also argue that sharing traumatic experiences would make relationships much tighter" is lazy nonsense writing that requires great vaguery to say is true. And if that's good enough for you to believe your statement then you can believe anything is true at that point. Harry went through traumatic experiences with Dumbledore at the Ministry and in the cavern in HBP, but it would be stupid to say "Hah, you see! That could bring them closer and they'd be in love!" In other words, just gesturing at shared trauma isn't going to make it make sense to have a relationship, there has to be more explored at an interpersonal level otherwise it just looks like a half-assed. You seem to think I said HS relationships never last; I said they rarely do, so the onus is on the writer to actually develop it so that it makes sense if it does.

** I don't mind 14, that's perfectly legal here in Germany and I know that some of my classmates were active back then. There isn't really a stigma on having sex at that age here, just make sure that you're safe (can't say that the girls parents would be thrilled, but what happens in Hogwarts...)

13 stretched things, I know it happens, but I really don't see Harry actually doing something at that age, but I can see how an older girlfriend could change things here. If you have to include it, stick to non penetrative stuff (and preferably no oral as well).

People fuck when they are bored, even my sixth grade Latin teacher had confirmed that (talking about Roman demographics). Hogwarts is a huge, unsupervised castle with enormous grounds and 10 adults. The only thing stopping sex from being rampant would be a lack of contraceptives, but then pregnancies would be a lot more common.

I'm fine with knowing it happens in a fic, but I can't read descriptive scenes with two underage people. Most people can't I'd assume. In my case, the girl is always an adult, or close to being one, but Harry isn't.

** I don't see young love as implausible even if it starts at 3rd year, or possibly even earlier (age 12-13). But those kind of relationships would be quite different from what most people call "relationships" -- basically close friends who might hold hands with the occasional chaste kiss. I would be surprised to see such a relationship last beyond shortterm.

4-5th year (14-15) is where I'd think "actual" more longterm romance would start to show up. However, going as far as sex before 7th year (17) would seem rather off to me.

One curious thing I've seen in both canon and fanon is that future relationships/marriages seem to start during school. This is, to my knowledge, /rare/ in real life. Not unheard of, but uncommon. Thus, what seems plausible in HP might look less so when trying to compare it to how things go IRL.

They also seem to forget how many people just didn't really date till they got into college or got a job. Like I get it wish fullfillment.

But I feel like it would be better if at least some books with teens and preteens acknowledge that romance isnt that big a deal. Alot of your relationships while you are a teen or a preteen arent that deep even though it might feel like it, and romance is cool but it's not the necessary to end a book about teens and preteens with engagements marriage. To a lot of people reading those books thats not how their highschool experience will end and that's fine.

*** I feel like as a kid things like that feel like those things you feel mature enough for even if you aren't participating at the moment you figure you could of see certain people your age as mature enough for that. Or maybe it's kinda a wish fullfillment thing to see someone your age do it. Which is fine as a kid but awkward to see as a adult. Like on the one hand it's not something that you would be ok thinking about anymore. You might even prefer just to think of childhood as much more innocent than it was. But you did know of people who had sex when they were young. And you know childhood is less innocent than how you would want to picture it. And I think it's important to acknowledge it.

For like the teens writing about smutty sex scenes about people their age I say let them have their fun. But for the adults who want to point out that this is a thing that exists I feel it's possible to make that something that happens without sexualizing it or making it erotic by focusing more on the effects of it happening after the fact rather than presenting sex in the erotic lens people are used to seeing it.

Should you choose to approach that at all as a adult think of when you were that age how insecure you were about your own body. How little you knew about your own body. How little you knew about sex. And how uncomfortable it would be to try to do anything resembling it then. And I don't mean in a comedic way and have cutesy hijinks ensue. I mean just how intimidating and uncomfortable it would be ( or was) to be sexual then.

As for like rushed relationships...it depends. Dating when you are in middle or highschool ( and sometimes even as adults) sometimes has alot of buildup but sometimes...its just kinda random just liking someones face and asking them out in less than a week with the connection sometimes fading just as fast. And if you have rushed relationships on that set up that are depicted as pretty shallow leading up to the characters dating ( and perhaps the relationship itself is pretty shallow) I'd say it's fine pretty realistic tbh. But if it's depicted as the deepest love to ever been conceived at 14 years old...I'm sorry you could have like 3 years of build up I dont buy it.

** i was doing some pretty gross public makeouts at 14. i think comes more down to opportunity than maturity. i probably would have had sex with my gf then if we could have found the privacy to make it happen

  I've legit seen fics where Harry lose his virginty at 14(guess who the female was), and it's just... weird. I'm fine with relationships like in canon; dates, short kisses and the lot, but I can't read about 14 year old kids having steamy make out sessions in a broom closet.
#+end_quote

You seem to be under the impression that sex between teenagers is some kind of culmination of a deeply romantic relationship. IMHO that doesn't mesh with reality.

I agree that overly serious dating comes across as weird and awkward at that age (14-16), but impulsive sexual contact that may or may not be regretted later is pretty par for the course no?

** In most books and fanfics I replace them main character with myself so age doesn't really bother me with this. The issue does come up where the authors of these fics have them act as kids in most things outside the romance. Having them not be able to go to Diagon without an escort but sleeping with Hermione. That bothers me because it makes no sense.

**** I was assuming Hermione tbh. There are plenty of stories where they get going in the fourth year.

Although I know of one Harry/Cedric/Viktor/Hermione/Fleur story where fake Moody slips them a lust potion. A gigantic free for all orgy ensures.

It can be found on Archive (big surprise).

** Depends but really the earliest I would go Is fourth and only really because of the tri-wizard tornement opens the window for some interesting Ideas.

Real if is not happening in fourth year because of shenanigans to do with the tornement then I prefer post Hogwarts if only because the plots of the last three books don't really lend themselfs to Harry getting up to amusing but unrealistic Kinky situations.

It also depends on how reliable a narrator the pov character is.

Harry and Hermione alone in the tent, with almost no hope of victory or survival. It would be "fuck me like it's our last day alive" with a regular frequency.

Harry and Romilda shenanigans. Everything from Potions or confronting her about it (and the ensuring "apology" on her knees) up to "Whatever happened to Bromance?".

Harry hatefucking Marietta. Alternatively, them making up and out in his sixth year.

Harry and anyone from the DA getting together. Maybe they decide to stay behind but then are locked into the RoR.

And the all-time classic, any girl cheering Harry up after the DoM fight/during the summer.

***** Well, you can always throw a squid or a tentacular plant in the mix, or some Lust potion which turns the user into a sex crazed zombie for its duration. Or Tonks and her metamorphic abilities. Or pregnant Fleur and Tonks if that what gets your engine going.

I'm just saying that there are countless scenarios possible in the later books, you just have to get creative instead of outright dismissing it.

I know that there is potential in the later years It's just the majority of fanfictions Are M/f or M/f+, but I would rather read F/fm or F+/fm.
