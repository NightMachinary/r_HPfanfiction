** Emperor "Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU." [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor]] This is a very well written and very long fic. I'm only on chapter 5 (but the chapters are massive), and I am engrossed.

** Unified Theory by Bouncing Soul [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4630585/1/Unified-Theory]]

It's sort of a crossover with Iron Man and plays cracky with the magic-as-energy idea, but I found it fun and engaging.

*** Unfortunately it skipped over the part that I wanted - period directly after ending of the Statute.

*** Is it finished story? I see nothing that would confirm it as either complete or abandoned.

**** I finished reading it myself just now. It does come to a close, but with room for a continuance or maybe a sequel.

** Well the James Potter series, starting with James Potter and the Hall of Elders Crossing. It just happened at the end of the last book.
