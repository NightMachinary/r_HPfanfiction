Some time ago I was looking for crack fics to read, ad I came across a story where McGonagall goes to Harry at the Dursley's instead of Hagrid and Harry questions why his name is Harry Potter when he isn't a ‚ÄúPotter‚Äù (if you get what I'm trying to say)

I'm sorry that I don't remember more but I randomly thought about it a minute ago and I can't seem to find it again.

If you know please please link it because it's driving me crazy trying to remember what it's called.

Thanks in advance :))

  My take on Harry's first year starting with him getting his letters. Add a lot of sarcasm, stir, and serve cold.
