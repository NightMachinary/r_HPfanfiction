I've read all from Engineer4Ever(PJO), Swords and Sorcery, the only two good ones in Eragon (Slowly and BCaL), The Observer Effect (best Tony every), Mistress Potter and the one where she's raped constantly during her childhood by the Dursleys and its an Avengers crossover (don't remember the name) and its quite long, like 300k+. Also read a couple in Twilight, but I wouldn't mind more.

Halp.


** I‘m curious, which are the two eragon crossovers you mention? I assume slowly is „slowly and then all at once“ but I can‘t figure „BCaL“ out.

*** By Courage and Love by Najex. It was inspired by Slowly, same premise and all, but it changes completely mostly due to personalities and writing preferences from the authors (it was allowed by the author of Slowly). In Slowly, there's more focus on integrating both magic systems, aswell as Helena being more mature and levelheaded, while Helena from BCaL is a lot more rash and impulsive, as Harry is in the canon. Godric's personality varies a lot too and BCaL is a lot more focused on romance, and while BCaL has progressed way more through Eragon's canon(they're halfway into the Eldest book) Slowly has significant more changes to the canon. Overall, I couldn't tell you which I like more, seeing as I love HP and Eragon, and both feel as a great fusion of them. So, my advice is, read the shortest and then the longest. The differences between them emerge right form the first chapter and only keep growing.

**** intrestingly enough, based on your search request i applied a filter to show only fics which are longer than 100k words and it did not show up in the results, don‘t know whats up with that, maybe I need to contact ff.net about that.

edit: found the fix, the preapplied age-filters were at fault.

** Harry Potter crossed over with Warhammer 40K. No pairings. Astartes. Warpfire. Power armor. Utter devotion to the glorious Imperium of Man.

If you aren't a fan of Warhammer 40K you will be after reading this.

  The Wizarding World is devastated when Harry Potter disappears from his relatives' house in mysterious circumstances during the summer after his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Desperate to have their boy-hero back no matter what they really should have heeded the Muggle saying "be careful what you wish for". Crossover HP/WH40K.

  When you're a Black, you're a Black and nobody gets to hold all the cards except you. Not a Dark Lord with a grudge, not a Headmaster with a prophecy and certainly not the world's most influential Mafia Family... Dorea is as much a Black as a Potter and she is not about to let anybody walk over her! A Fem!Harry story. Slow Build.

** Well, there's Back to the Beginning, which is a LOTR crossover.... Not sure if it counts since FemHarry here is... kind of like male!Harry who has been reincarnated into a female body but still remembering living as male!Harry... It's not a bad story, but it's been a while since it was updated.

*** Looks interesting, not a huge fan of LOTR, mostly because I read the books and didn't enjoy them(except for Frodo's arc) compared to the movies, so it never clicked with me. Yeah, I don't mind if its genderbend. As long as the MC isn't in a MxM relationship, I don't care much. Thanks.
