I'm pretty sure he was a PI-style guy but he might've been more of a mercenary. Harry's employer didn't mention that he'd have to fight so many vampires. The vampires also captured a bunch of muggles and were using them to power some object. That's all I remember, hopefully one of you kind redditors can remember the title of the fic and let me know what it is.

Thanks in advance!


** Midnight Blues? I cant link it rn but a quick search and you will find it.

At least I think it might be Midnight Blues, if your remember Ron being with him than it might be it.

*** do you remember the author's name? The only Midnight Blues story that I see is the one by Plot Bunny Whisperer, which doesn't sound at all like what I'm looking for. Ron may have been in the story (he might have been a PI/merc alongside Harry) but I remember that the main show down didn't involve Ron.

I remember that after the battle, he returns to Greengrass/Parkinson manor wounded and has a discussion about some object that the Vampires had. It was also not a very long fic either.

**** That actually sounds like one of mine. It's only a one-shot.

***** And help comes from the author themselves! :) That's the one! Thank you for the rec and thank you for writing a great one-shot, it kept me guessing right up to the end. I really liked hardboiled style you wrote in, there really aren't enough of those kinds of fics around.

**** Was it a first person story? There's a story in first person where the goblins screwed Harry over, so he and Ron become mercenaries of sorts.
