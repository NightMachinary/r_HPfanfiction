** It started with such good intentions.\\
A noble (if not wise) wizard wanted to spread better awareness of climate change. He knew exactly how dangerous it is, the risk it posed to humankind muggle and magical alike, the threat to ecosystems natural and supernatural...\\
To try and reach as many people as possible, to make them understand and blow past all the misinformation and confusion, he looked to adapt a last-ditch system employed by Unspeakables; a magical transmission system, broadly based on radio, designed to transmit a Memory Charm worldwide.\\
 \\
It almost went according to plan. The Global Memory Charm was modified and inverted, serving to 'add' memories and make them important rather than making them forgotten.\\
A package of information was assembled, fact-checked, and then, broadcast worldwide to the mind of every living creature on Earth.\\
 \\
And that's where things went wrong; the package of information was too large, and it was magically unbalanced. Entire mental dossiers of the causes of climate change, environmental effects, mass extinctions, fossil fuel usage, etc, were almost entirely lost in transmission. Only a scant few concepts made it through, ideas and phrases that recurred again and again in the package, now stripped of all context.\\
'Humans are hurting the planet.'\\
'Humans are destroying nature.'\\
'Humans must be stopped.'\\
 \\
The broadcast infested the mind of every living thing. Most animals lacked the mentality to understand it. A smarter few like elephants and dolphins began to rampage as well as they could. There was a week of riots worldwide as human muggles were pushed towards violent urges before their minds ultimately rejected the new information. Most magical leaders were able to warn their people of the misanthropy-inducing supernatural influence, averting the worst of it.\\
 \\
But, magical creatures, the numerous intelligent ones from hippogriffs to dragons all the way down to puffskeins, were affected by the broadcast as well. And magical creatures as a rule tend to be far more intelligent than non-magical ones.\\
One by one, the magical creatures of the world stopped, to consider the threat that was humans. And then, they began to walk, and to fly, instinctually collaborating, species like post owls leading the way to human settlements...

*** Funny thing is, magical creatures would have way more trouble with muggle weaponry than they would with wizards. 15ish dragons working together could probably murder all of Hogwarts easily, but an RPG could prooobably take one out pretty easily.

**** The more physical the bodies and attacks of the magical creatures are, the easier they're to kill for the muggles. Unless they get lucky with a thrown boulder giants lose to tanks every time. Napalm and insecticides deal with acrumantulas and no dragon will survive modern anti air rocketry. Even nundus and basilisks will get killed by computer guided bombs after their kill aura and kill sight get figured out. Centaurs might avoid a few fights due to their precognition, but in a fight against modern soldiers they're basically archers on horses. Goblins are smart and make great melee weapons, but they don't seem to have an answer for modern weapons. A dragon burst out of gringotts in the books, a bunker buster bomb going the other way will warm them up nicely. House elves are tricky, they teleport in, kill the nearest people with force pushes and teleport out. But they will also die to a bullet if you're fast enough, so while many civilians will die the muggles have to only get lucky once, the house elves every time. The most difficult by far are Dementors. They have a freezing aura, so they can be dedected by infrared cameras, but otherwise the muggles must fight blind against them. As far as everyone knows they can't be destroyed (but I doubt the wizards tried things like vacuums, gamma radiation, the amount of heat and pressure in a nuclear explosion, acids, extreme high voltages and other things), so containment is the only option. As Dementors can't float through walls and have to open doors, they can be captured with nets and imprisoned. Put them in a sturdy container and drop them into the Mariana trench, where they might starve from lack of people feeling fear.

While the losses in both civilians and soldiers will undoubtedly be high, especially in the initial surprise, I have no doubt that muggles eventually learn to deal with all of them.

***** Yeah, a lot of magical creatures don't really have much going for them beyond being resistant to magic.

You can kill a basilisk with a sword and those things are about as scary as it gets.

**** Depends on the creature, most creatures are vulnerable to the killing curse (which would probably get quickly legalised in this scenario), with the exception of Nundus which are specifically immune and a few weird things like poltergeists and dementors which seem to be completely unkillable.

** Fawkes alone makes this an interesting matchup. Kinda in a similar vein to the whole muggles vs wizards thing, there's not really a way to prevent a Phoenix from teleporting wherever it wants. Probably would get hit by an avada kedavra at some point though, and then killing him constantly would keep him as a chick. Presumably Fawkes can't teleport as a chick.

But getting Fawkes into a position where he has to even take that risk would be difficult.
