I'm writing some adventures as a Parselmouth for Harry at the moment, and I'm characterizing the majority of snakes as being... Not outright unhelpful, but merely petulant and quite focused on themselves. I'm writing them as more like the dragons in How To Train Your Dragon rather than friendly, helpful pets who will help any random human who happens to be able to talk to them.

It occurred to me that for any fic I've read involving Parseltongue as a plot point, I don't think I've ever read a portrayal that writes snakes like snakes (i.e. they're not going to engage in a philosophical conversation because they're snakes and they don't care), and doesn't write them as being uber friendly and helpful.

Does anyone have any recs for stories where that's the case? They don't have to be Harry or Voldemort centred - I wouldn't mind reading a Slytherin fic where this is the case.

** In linkffn(8197451) there are a few snakes Harry interacts with along the same vein.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

  "You're at your new home," I said. "Welcome to the trunk. You're following me, now."

  The snake backed up. "Why?"

  "I can talk to you."

  She sniffed anxiously at the air. "That is true, but you are not my master."

  I raised an eyebrow. "Are you sure?"

  "...Less so now." Nagini said and slithered towards my feet. I patted her head.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

** The snakes are pretty funny in linkffn(magical relations). One is friendly with an extremely unique personality and a couple others are quite murderous.

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*
