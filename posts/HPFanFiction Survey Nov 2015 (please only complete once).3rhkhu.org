If anyone wants access to the raw data to do more detailed analytics just give me a shout.

Edit: Hrm, I had expected that the "Other" options would take what people had written and turn them into a new category that would be part of the pie charts. Clearly that hasn't happened. What I'll have to do is use the raw data to make a chart of the responses once the survey is over (i.e. when responses stop coming in).

Edit2: Interesting to contrast the DLP results: [[http://dlpsurvey.krzaq.cc/]]

Edit 3: Okay, we have over 500 responses now, so I'm closing the survey. Thanks everyone! Big props to the people of this sub for not trolling the survey. Not a single "attack helicopter" in sight for the gender question.

A lot of his prowess is handwaved, and a lot of his actions are ... well, let's just say they don't support the claim that he's the most brilliant wizard of his era. Or the most brilliant Dark wizard, unless all other Dark Arts practitioners are either knaves or fools.

So Voldemort rarely feels like a three-dimensional character to me, which means I don't have that intense an emotional response to him. Umbridge, on the other hand, is deliciously deceitful, effective, and repulsive in ways I find entirely plausible.

I disagree, this sub and DLP are male-dominated, but there are other communities that are female-dominated. Most of the stories that I read where I know the author's gender, the author is female.

That, combined with popularity of harem and harry/multi threads, lead to my belief that this sub is more male-dominated.

As we are offtopic though: Draco/Hermione = star crossed lovers, generally an appealing trope in romance stories. And Snape/Hermione I think is 99% because of Alan Rickman's voice, although I'll admit the revealed backstory in DH also makes him somewhat more appealing. Lonely, dark man with a troubled past and such.

**** I agree with this and wonder if it relates to the platform. I tend to find (with HP and other fandoms) on other sites that there are generally a lot of women reading fanfiction. So much so that finding a guy is a big thing. But on Reddit (even for fanfiction subs like this) there tends to be more men overall.

Anecdotally I find a lot of women I know are not really aware of Reddit esp for fandom things or finding fic. Or they are surprised I use it because they've heard it can be a hostile place for women. I'd be curious to see what the overall gender usage of Reddit is in general compared to the results for this sub.

If this same survey was replicated on twitter or in other communities I wonder if it would be a similar level...I doubt it would.

But yes, I do agree that overall there's quite many women into fan fiction, both writing and reading it; and of those on my alert list whose genders I do know most indeed are women, though whether that's because of their style of writing or because so many are women is not something I know.

***** Yeah, I wandered over from what's left of HP fandom on LJ, which used to be incredibly active and was definitely majority female. Also, the HP section on Archive of Our Own, which was founded by slash fans, is still mostly comprised of fics posted by women.

So the existence of harem stories - which don't seem to be a very prominent fantasy for women - and the focus on Daphne Greengrass surprised me, because I'd never encountered their popularity before. Also, the discomfort with slash on this subreddit is partly explained by the percentage of straight men here. Likewise, the tendency to re-write Harry as a warlike world-conquering badass, whereas on LJ you'd see a lot of superpowered Harry whose ambitions and affections stayed more within the scope of canon and of the familiar, developed characters.

It's a reminder of how huge the HP fandom still is, even now.

****** Hmm ... I'd think harem stories to make sense from women's perspective.

I mean, yes, I don't get the whole fixation on pairings and romance (which probably makes me weird to at least some degree, what with the perception that women's literature is mostly romance), but if you aren't unwilling to share---and harem as it is written by most fan fiction writers presumes consent to share from the get-go so it's technically not cheating and the danger of the relationship ending is lower---then in a typical fan fiction scenario where the so-called “harem politics” aren't an issue it's sort of an easy way out if you put yourself in the place of the character because you both get the guy /and/ don't actually have to fight with other women /and/ most likely the man is going to be quite rich.

So yeah, peculiar kind of wish fulfilment. Though personally I prefer stories of the usual fantasy kind (you know, the character has a goal, struggles to achieve it, there's a journey of some sort either mental or actual, and so on) with the main character being female, so I tend to be a sucker for the “fem!(whatever-main-character)” stories for as long as they aren't centred on romance (I don't mind if it's there, but as part of the story that makes sense and not its central part that is or at least feels forced).

Not sure about the slash part, though, so I'll take your word for it. Though I do think it might have some to do with how low-quality much of the slash is and how enforced the pairings feel, too. Because most people who write slash (be it “femslash” or “slash that is not femslash”; honestly, the distinction feels weird to me, but eh, whatever) do it mostly for the pairing---and for the smut, of course---and that means their plot tends to suck.

#+end_quote

Yeah, no. I mean, we all tend to universalize our own opinions, but objectively speaking, slash fic is no more "low quality" than het fic, femslash, or gen, percentage-wise. There are excellent slash fics, good, thoughtful, erotic, emotional, plotty, etc. And of course there's mediocre slash, and embarrassingly bad slash, and the ratio of good to bad is exactly as much tilted toward badfic as any other category. Het and gen fic are not bastions of glorious prose and fictional plausibility. Nor are they any more persuasive to me, on a pairing level, than slash fic. The epics of Harry going dark or conquering the world often render his character and the magical universe unrecognizable to me, perhaps in the same proportion to which you find romance or pairing fic OOC. It depends, as always, on the writer's talent.

And believe me, if you're gay or bisexual or simply sympathetic, slash pairings don't feel any more 'forced' than other non-canon pairings. For thousands of readers and writers, they're far more interesting than anything canon gave us. They're unexplored territory - territory you may not care about, but we do.

I don't deny that most romance plots are unsuited to sustaining 100K word stories on relationship development alone; other elements are crucial to keeping a story inventive rather than repetitive. But, oddly enough, that applies to non-romance, too. Very few fanfics, IMO, can pull off epic-length wordcount. The writer has to be talented on several levels - basically, have the skill set of a novelist. That's rare in fandom.

(And apologies if you already know this, but the term 'slash' was coined 50 years ago when Kirk/Spock fic became a huge underground phenomenon. The slang term 'slash' derives from the use of / between names, and it signifies exclusively male/male. The word 'fem-' or 'femmeslash' grew out of a need to flag female-oriented content, a necessary distinction because readers of f/f want desperately to find each other's stories in the sea of m/m fic. The descriptors 'gay' and 'lesbian' aren't used because the characters generally aren't, canonically speaking.)

One last thought, re: harem fics. I assume - and those who read and write them, please speak up to contradict me if I'm wrong - that the fics are written from Harry's POV (or Neville's or whoever's), not from the female characters'. I've seen mention of Harry "deserving to get all those gorgeous girls," which implies women as things to acquire, like prizes, and most women I know don't think of themselves that way. And the people I've met in poly relationships certainly don't consider themselves part of a harem. So, fantasy, yes, but not one I've noticed in any of my female-dominated fandom circles.

Thank you for telling me my writing sucks without having taken the trouble to read it. Not that I expect you would like it, and not that I require /anyone/ to like something that's not their jam. But it's a rather large leap to make, and partly what I mean by "discomfort with slash" - the tendency to assume, without giving evidence other than "it's slash," that it's somehow different in kind and quality from het fic. In my experience, het fic is just as preoccupied with pairings and smut - and I see absolutely nothing wrong with that.

******** Actually, I never wrote that slash is objectively worse or even any worse than other stories on average. It's all about being centred on romance to such a degree that anything resembling plot is forgone that makes them suck in my opinion.

But considering this part:

#+begin_quote
  Thank you for telling me my writing sucks without having taken the trouble to read it.
#+end_quote

It seems that I hit a sensitive point and you went on a rant without actually making sure that you are ranting at the right person.

I honestly want to say that what you did was bad form, but considering that much of your message isn't a rant but an actually helpful reply and that you probably had to rant at people who though you vile for being into slash, I guess I can sort of understand even if I think you should have paused for a moment and checked twice before doing that (because it doesn't feel nice when someone chews you out for writing something you didn't actually write, you know).

And just to make it clear, because I do not desire to fight with you because---the part that is a rant aside---your replies were actually fairly good, I do not have anything against slash; if anything, I have quite a lot against romance that makes no sense and has no plot and is just garbage, and quite a lot of stories (including slash, but neither being limited to slash nor being more common with slash) in general are like that; no, let's take it even further, I dislike stories that make no sense in general and are just contrived, and the romance genre in fan fiction is just more notable for stories like that. But there are stories with slash that I like, even if none of them are romance-centred and the slash just happens to be there. Though sure, I do sort of prefer “femslash” over the other kind because it's kind of easier to see myself as one of the characters, but either way I don't have any issues with slash at all (and the “sort of” is there not because of romance reasons but rather because I generally like having a character to project myself onto, and that means I like if there's at least one woman or girl in the story who is actually a worthwhile character, and sometimes slash that is not “femslash” has not a single female character that is important to the plot). And yes, bisexual, but it doesn't really matter.

Continuing from the above, think about it: most of the stories are of low quality, so you rely on people's recommendations. But there are less recommendations for slash because less people are into it, so if you want to try it you most likely will have to try on your own, and most likely (because you do not have any recommendations and the average quality of fan fiction in general is low) you will get something bad. Say what you want, but I think that does contribute to how some people feel about it, as instead of getting recommendations for slash the way “normal” stories get recommendations they step on a mine and decide that it's all bad, rinse and repeat with many other people.

And getting back to harems, neither have I seen any written from a woman's perspective, or at least none that were not crack which I think doesn't count. I'm just looking at it with what I have and taking a guess about what could be appealing about the genre to other women considering that most of those stories are indeed male-centric and it seems sort of counter-intuitive. I'm not saying that my guess is right, since I actually suck at romance (yay, me), and I'm pretty sure even those who are into it don't read all the stories in the genre because some (make that many, most likely, as it tends to be with fan fiction in general) are still trash, but that's what I have for the guess.

Also, is there an umbrella term for both “slash” and “femslash”? I don't want to keep on writing both because it's seriously annoying but it appears that if I do not it will be taken wrongly by other people. Though thanks for the info about the origin of the word, that was ... sort of helpful; well, it will be if there's an umbrella term for both, otherwise I will deem it shrug-worthy and just keep on explaining what I mean.

********* Sorry, this is a quick reply because I have to dash to work, but - no, it wasn't fair to call you out on the slash remark, and I apologize for being unpleasant. You're not doing anything that a thousand other people haven't done before you. Here's the thing, though. I've been in fandom for 10 years - a drop in the bucket compared to a lot of other folks - and although my "community" (several overlapping circles, actually) is primarily slashers and femslashers, it's populated by fans who write and read all sorts of things - except, apparently, for certain tropes that are popular here, but that's not really pertinent to this point. I've participated in conversations in all venues all over LJ and Dreamwidth and lurked in even more. And again and again, I and other slashers have seen the formulation "Slash is bad because..." or "Slash sucks because...", and the end of the sentence is always something to do with implausible pairings, romanticizing the villain characters, self-inserts, terrible prose - reasons that apply to /all other fanfiction./ So if you had said "most fanfic is sucky because..." I wouldn't have had a problem with it Because it's true. We all know that. Who better, since we're the ones who read and write the stuff? But slash gets singled out over and over for the sins that afflict /all/ fanfic as if those inadequacies are something particular to slash or as if slash stories unavoidably and automatically have a higher ratio of suck to excellence. The people who say this perpetuate the assumption, and other people repeat it as if it's a well-known fact. It's a way of separating slash from "real" fanfic - cutting it out of the herd and then blaming it for the mainstream perception that all fanfic is squicky and gross and written by teenagers on a sugar high.

The difficulty in finding recs for good slash and femslash fic is an accident of entry point, I suspect. And of personal taste. When I entered fandom - when I fell in with a surprised and resounding thud - I fell directly into a slash community, found friends immediately, found and joined rec communities, paid attention to the names of authors whose stories I loved, talked to other people who were posting about slash, and set about tracking down all the fic I could consume concerning my favorite pairings/characters. I was lucky, because LiveJournal was at its fannish peak then, and it made conversation central to my experience, plus it was the sort of platform in which rec communities flourished. I had no trouble at all locating or making recs, although if I'd fallen into

Btw, I think I also had a exasperated reaction to your post because you made no distinction between "pairing fic sucks" and "I don't like pairing fic." Romance is a perfectly good reason for a fic to exist. As always, the quality lies in the handling of it. There is absolutely nothing wrong with romance/erotica as a genre - but there's also nothing wrong with having zero interest in it. I don't read published romance fic, and my interest in slash is closely tied to my interest in very specific characters. I'm in fandom for the characters and to a lesser extent the world. But I like the erotic charge between characters enough to write it, and I've discovered some extremely talented authors during my time in fandom, whose work I will defend against all sneers and dismissals.

I also understand the preference for having a woman character in fic that you can relate to, and I know plenty of readers, whether femslash or het fans, have no interest in slash because its main focus isn't women. The lack of women doesn't bother me, because I obsess about certain characters and dynamics (and now certain favorite writers) and don't give a fig about the rest. But I can certainly see the point. I read a metric ton of published fiction, and most of the novels have a vast spectrum of female characters, so that's where I get my fix when it comes to reading about women. Mainstream fiction doesn't give me what I seek from slash fic, though. I come to fandom for what I can't find in published fic.

And of course there's the issue of misogyny, which used to be a fairly pronounced ugliness in older slash fic and still lurks in some writers' output. However, het fic is just as misogynist - it expresses it differently and has its own popular ugly tropes, but it's just as guilty. Having female characters in a fic doesn't magically absolve it of idiotic attitudes toward women. Misogyny in fandom is a thing, and it's a backbutton issue for me, too. But lack of female main characters isn't inherently misogynist if the story is focused on the developing relationship between two men. Don't read it if that bores you, but don't consign it to the suck bucket on reflex. And I think it's fair to say that both het and slash have slowly been evolving away from old unexamined attitudes toward sexuality and women's purpose in plot and as protagonists, mirroring changes in the culture at large.

Re: terminology. No, there's no umbrella term. Slash and femslash are two different things, and it's important to have terminology that distinguishes them. Fans who write femslash have fought to gain visibility and a sense of community separate from the larger perception of slash, which has a much more dramatic popular presence and a gazillion more fanworks. As a consumer of both, I certainly don't want them folded back together because the effective outcome would be that femslash disappears inside the umbrella term.

...so much for being a quick reply. But I am sorry for snarking at you. You're not the first and won't be the last to frame the conversation in a way that implies things you don't mean to imply (although in your follow-up response, I think you /do/ mean to imply that slash is worse because it evolved as pairing fic, which means it can never escape its roots as romance - which I don't agree with, and which, if true, would be true of het fic as well, but never mind). I've just heard this said over and over and over and over by fans who would scoff or be defensive if someone stated the same thing about their preferred genre as if it were an accepted fact, and would debunk the assumption just as sharply.

Ninety percent (or more) of fanfic is ... not good, and some of it is downright execrable and gives me secondhand embarrassment, and that applies across the board. Fortunately, no one has to read badfic (unless they get a kick out of it), and no one has to read good fic if it's not their thing.

One last point (yes, yes, eyeroll - I apologize for nattering on): I have no problem with people criticizing individual fics for their poor storytelling, grammar, characterization, what have you - although I'll snort disparagingly at anyone who says "that pairing is stupid and unbelievable and the fic is automatically awful because Snape/Harry (or fill in the blank), because ugh, who would write /that/?" And I'll discount their opinion as not worth my time. But praise and concrit of specific stories is always welcome; it's part of the fun of a shared interest. Selective condemnation of entire genres? Not so much.

********** Well, I have to say thanks for taking the time to write is, especially with so much of it (it may or may not seem like it, but I do like walls of text---for as long as they aren't a single three-page-long paragraph in a story).

And I apologise too; I probably could have worded what I wrote much better, it's a recurring issue for me and tends to result in misunderstandings of just that sort.

I do agree with you on the entry point thing. And this is actually what I was trying to write about when I wrote the part in which you think I ended up once again seemingly down-putting slash. Sorry about that, I have a tendency to go on a tangent once I start writing something and then end with a batch of text that resembles a pancake more than it does the original idea. Thing is, with a wrong (I think that's not the perfect word to use there, but I can't think of any better one right now) point of entry it's harder to find stories of a certain kind (due to lack of community that actually recommends those stories and all that), and since there are more, probably many more, points of entry that aren't about slash or femslash or both, than they are dealing with either of those, it's a self-perpetuating cycle and I think (or at least hope) that you get what I mean here despite me probably mangling the text yet again: that at least some, and possibly many, people think slash (and femslash) to be worse just because they didn't luck out with their entry point and were left with swimming in the sea of rubbish to find the good stories those with the entry point in question would have shortly gotten recommended to them, and that that is something that happens to many other genres too and not only slash.

As for the lack of distinction ... well, I do make a distinction there, it's just that I once again failed to convey it well. /I don't mind pairing fics/ for as long as the plot makes sense and is interesting and the pairing does not feel out of place with the plot in the story (so if you write a story that made it make sense and the story was interesting and it would be well written, I could probably enjoy even something like Petunia/Dolores); on the other hand, I am of the opinion that /most pairing fics suck, just like most fics suck in general, and it's just more visible with romance-centric stories/ because instead of a failure with some plot device or some plot hack you have a failure with emotions which leaves a more intensive distaste after biting into such a thing. I guess in the end it's that most of the stories where I enjoyed the romance did not have the romance as the primary focus but rather a secondary one, just being there but not actually making the fic appear as “romance” for me, not primarily at the very least.

Point is ... because I'm probably making a pancake out of the text again, that I do make a distinction and the same reasons that turn me from romance fiction also turn me from other fiction, but that reason happens to be more visible when the story is centred on romance. Or at least I see it as more visible then, which might very well be due to a certain personal reason that is a mess to get into.

And another thing is, for me both slash and femslash are just as real a fan fiction as stories that are neither of those are. Notably, I remember enjoying a Harry/Lucius fan fiction (with no smutty bits, but eh, whatever) which weirded me out but only because I don't like Lucius as a character and the very fact that the author managed to make not only the pairing but also Lucius's character for it make sense left me feeling confounded for a bit (kudos to the author, in any case, for making it actually work). Just, you know, I lack that point of entry so for me it's random digging until I find something read-worthy from that category ... well, either of those categories, since it would appear that slash and femslash are not the same thing. So yeah, it's not about slash or femslash evolving from romance (did it even? I don't know and I don't think it would be fair if I rejected it based on the potential of that being true), but about each and every individual story it is about for me being /too much/ about romance, to the point where the plot isn't there; but if the plot is there and the story is written well, I don't mind and probably will enjoy romance, be it het, slash, femslash, polyamorous relationship or whatever else there might be (I mean, for as long as all the people involved are all happy with it, it shouldn't really matter what their relationship is like exactly and with whom), and the specific pairings don't matter to me for as long as the characters are likeable and the pairing works in that particular story within the plot of that particular story.

I guess, all in all, I'm just bad with romance because I tend to approach it really logically (or so they call the approach; I perceive it as a bit absurd but eh) so I can't stomach romance that tastes like plastic. It doesn't mean I dislike romance as it is, I'm just ... I guess it would be fair to say I am overly critical, not only towards that but about other things as well.

As for misogyny, I'll probably sound stupid here, but my approach to it in stories has pretty much always been “eh, people are being stupid again”; I know it's here in many stories, and not only in stories actually, but that's something that goes from the culture and the times we are or were in so I can't really blame the fiction for it (unless the author of the piece I am trying to read happens to be just that bad, in which case I'll probably not read it anyway). And I can project myself onto male characters so I can do with that, it's just ... easier, I guess, or more convenient, to do that with female characters.

And yes, I do agree that off-handed condemnation of whole genres is a no-go. I do tend to say “most of [insert whatever] suck”, but that's because I'm used to the fact that most of everything sucks with no exceptions and unless you get recommendations you just have to keep on digging for the good stuff that is there somewhere under the mountain of crud. But there are good stories in every category ... or at least in most, there might be some niche category that only has one story made by some troll, I don't know enough to reject the possibility of that being the case.

And thanks again. In any case I'll be trying to explain what I mean more readably in the future, if such a thing is even a possibility with me, so that we'd avoid any repeats of the past ... I guess it would be fair to call it silliness, since neither of us actually meant to wage war. And from my side I just ask that if you see me saying something that sounds controversial, ask if I meant it or if I'm just not making sense again, and it'll probably happen to be the latter and all will be fine (and yes, I'm like that with talking in real life too, goes with having a motor-propelled mouth and a weird sense of humour and a near lack of ability to detect sarcasm even in one's own speech).

#+end_quote

Funnily enough, when reading sex scenes, I prefer reading about two guys instead of two girls (if it comes to non-heterosexual sex), despite being a straight woman.

I don't read slash fics in general though, because I mostly read romance stories and frankly, I just want a female protagonist and a hot guy for that. Although if it is a more smutty fic I don't mind a second guy being added to that...

One question though, what do you think about authors not tagging stories as (fem)slash? It rather annoys me if a romance story goes that way because it breaks my identification with the protagonist, but I imagine it also makes it harder to find the story for people who /are/ interested in it?

*** It was obviously Herpo the Foul, inventor of the Horcrux. It may not have been perfect, but it was an easily used method for Immortality that he brought into reach of the common wizard. Uncommon wizard. Rare wizard with the appropriate conscience and morals... fuck it. SOUL MANIPULATION. That's like saying Einstein was a terrible scientist because someone used his knowledge to build those big ass bombs. Granted, Herpo did all of the terrible things too, Herpo *THE FOUL*, but there's no discounting his genius or the untapped potential of his research.

*** To be honest, I don't think the guy trusts himself. That would explain why he's not actually using his positions to force things to happen and instead simply has them because they were offered to him and he couldn't reject the offers without being impolite.

I mean, seriously, his choices led to the death of his sister, to him falling out of favour with his brother, to Grindewald having more time to do whatever nefarious things he'd been doing, to Tom not being stopped in time, to the Potters dying, and so on ... so yeah, a great man with a great many mistakes, I'd be really surprised if he wasn't doubting most if not all of the decisions he was making.

**** Hmm. I don't think Harry's dumb, and I don't think Dumbledore's mad. They're certainly not written to be that way. I do think Dumbledore maintains a "realpolitik" perspective that means he's willing to sacrifice individuals for the sake of the community - without necessarily consulting said individuals on their willingness to be sacrificed. He also has a bad habit of appointing himself the one who knows best, even though he /knows/ he's capable of catastrophic mistakes.

Yes, he's a good man and a great wizard, but he plays things unnecessarily close to the vest, lies by omission, withholds information from people who would fare better if they knew the odds, and depends (by authorial default) far too much on coincidence and luck. I think he's manipulative and that he failed to put his faith in the experience and skills of other strong, intelligent magical folk, and that keeping them in the dark probably led to unnecessary deaths.

But I do love him. I think he's a fantastic character who's wise, often compassionate, witty, and complex. But that doesn't mean I'd want to trust him with my life.

****** Heh. I've seen it used by other fans in discussions about Dumbledore - specifically his willingness to incorporate young children into the war against Voldemort, his decisions about Harry's life and training, the way he uses Snape, and the fact that he masterminds the opposition to the Death Eaters rather than soliciting help from potential allies. He's fairly ruthless, although that ruthlessness extends to himself as well.

#+begin_quote
  Why is which country you identify with not only different from the resdential one, but mandatory?
#+end_quote

Because many people identify with a different nationality than their country of residence - as evidenced by the fairly significant difference between the two. If it's the same for you, just put it as the same country. Don't see what the problem is.

#+begin_quote
  Why can I not homeschool my kids in magic?
#+end_quote

A) This was in "fun stuff" and is not a serious question.

B) It wasn't the intent to list all possible modes of education, just the three we're familiar with from canon.

C) The point of a survey is to group people into broad categories so as to produce general conclusions. A survey that was so fine grained as to allow each person to give individually specific answers would be pointless.

#+begin_quote
  I believe HP about the return of the Dark Lord, but Dumbledore is a mad old fool.
#+end_quote

See A and C above.

#+begin_quote
  I'm a liberalist/anarchist; there's certainly a category for that somewhere, but it's not one of the options you listed.
#+end_quote

See C above. If I started listing every possible political ideology and variation thereof the question would just be a mess. You're meant to pick the answer which is closest to your position, because when you're aiming at a large number of people it's impossible to provide an answer that everyone is going to look at and think "Yup, that's me!".
