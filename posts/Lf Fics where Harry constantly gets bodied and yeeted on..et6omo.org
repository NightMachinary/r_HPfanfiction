** This fic has Harry that is innately even weaker than canon Harry. Canon Harry has performed a few spells on first try. This Harry can't. He trains with a desperate intensity that puts Hermione to shame and as the story progresses he gets stronger and stronger. But early on, he suffered. IIRC even later on he survives by taking the enemy by surprise, or when they are distracted.

***** There's an Anime called Re:Zero, basically an isekai fantasy. The main character is called Subaru, and his power is that everytime he dies, he returns to a previous point in time. He doesn't control the exact place he has his 'save point', much like this Harry.

******* I can't name any off hand. I'm pretty sure I haven't seen any before, but it has been a few years since I've seriously searched through Harry Potter fanfics, so there might be something more recently. The power is called 'Return by Death', if that makes any searches easier on you.
