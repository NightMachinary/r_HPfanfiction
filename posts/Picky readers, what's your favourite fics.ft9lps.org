And by picky I mean really picky, the more fics you drop the better :P

Trying to get into HP fanfics, but I haven't found any ones I've liked except for 2 short comedies and this one: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13405869/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Paradigm-Shift][Hermione Granger and the paradigm shift]]

Also tried some of the better ranked ones at ff.net, but I found them either too ridicolous or out of character.


** linkffn(Cauterize) is probably one of the most universally liked fics out there. Def. worth a try.

** I feel like Harry Potter fan fiction can be a little hard for people to get into sometimes. There is so much of it out there, and a lot of it heavily pulls on specific tropes or influences where you either need to have an interest in those kinds of fics or you need to be able to suspend your belief of what the Harry Potter universe is to really enjoy it without having read fics that it draws its influence from.

It's kind of like drinking alcohol, people tend to start off by drinking coolers and sweet drinks that taste like juice before they move on to wine and hard liquor, because that is more of an acquired taste. Same with Harry Potter fanfiction. Some of the most recommended ones on here are for what I would call the advanced reader, not someone new. No one starting off in Harry Potter fanfiction is reading a 300k word story about how Harry and a female Voldemort get sent back to the time of the founders and fall in love.

I'd recommend starting with something easy, look for good post hogwarts fics. Something that realistically continues the story from where the books left off. Or canon compliant marauders era fics about their time in Hogwarts. I'm horrible at remembering the ones I've read and being able to recommend them, but there's a few really good ones in each of those categories.

**** Try the stories by Northumbrian on ffnet.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian]]

That should keep you busy for a while.

In my personal opinion though "Blood Magic" by Gateway Girl is a really good introduction to HP fanfic for three reasons: It is really well written, known as a "fandom classic" (it was finished before HBP came out) and it introduces new readers to some of the common tropes in the fandom.

Blood Magic is a so-called Severitus fic, this means that in 6th year Harry finds out Snape is his biological father.

*** Sounds good.

Another comment recommended post-hogwarts era fics or canon-compliant marauder era ones, and I really wouldn't mind either of those.

I'm mostly interested in stories about Harry, Ron or Hermione though, so fics set during their time at hogwarts would really be fine as well haha. I like Harmony the most, but Harry/Ginny is a close second and I don't mind Ron/Hermione either really. As long as the fic is good, and beliavable based on it's own boundaries.

The only thing I'd like to avoid is bashing of any of the good guys, genres don't matter as much although at least a side-dish of romance makes everything better.

Cheers!

******** Yeah, Delenda Est is great...probably my favorite HP fanfic. The realistic humanizing of Bellatrix, character progression and rapport between her and Harry were what I was hoping to replicate in my story. Daphne referring to everyone as 'idiot' was basically a straight up steal of Bellatrix calling people nitwits, dummies, etc.

I'm not a big fan of the sequel (the important story had been told and the plotting/characters/travelling between two dimension became too overly complex for me) but I really like their Susan/Harry story Final Protocol. The only problem is it is in progress and hasn't been updated for over a year and a half.

Yeah I read some reviews and the sequel doesn't seem to be as popular. I also believe the main story lost some of it's charm after the second timejump, but it was still pretty good. It was just so delightful seeing Harry interact with the Blacks and Malfoy, his parents as a teacher/student and also getting to know Bellatrix rather than just being married later on.

** I usually go by the author - if I like one story, I try all of them. And then I look at the author's recs or favorite stories.

I do a search on AO3 for terms that appeal or pairings I like.

I will read most pairings, but I also like gen, so try that.

I like crossovers, so that might work.

And I will read unfinished stories if they are over a certain length (which for me is 20,000 words usually unless it is a sequel or I really dig the author's writing or the trope). Despite how terrible it is to not have a completed fic, you will miss many good stories if you are hardline about WIPs.
