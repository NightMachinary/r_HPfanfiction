** When the killing curse struck Harry at the age of 1, his mother's love didn't protect him from death; it allowed him to transcend it.

--------------

10 years later, Hagrid is hiking through the hills of Scotland with a Hogwarts letter in hand, when a small phoenix lands on his head and chirps merrily. Then a whole nest's worth of phoenixes flap down and start using the half-giant's head and shoulders as a perch before chattering noisily amongst themselves.

"Ah, it's nice to meet yeh all too," Hagrid chuckled, before he held up the letter, "I don't suppose any of you lot would know where I could find a Harry Potter?"

There was a pause, then all of the phoenixes started squawking excitedly at once, the smallest of them leaping off Hagrid's head and flapping his way to the ground before bouncing around excitedly.

Hagrid smiled, "Are yeh going to lead the way to him? That's nice of yeh."

The littlest phoenix shook his head before flapping his wings awkwardly, trying to point to himself.

"...Are /you/ Harry? Blimey, why are you a phoenix, lad?...And the important question, do yeh want to come to Hogwarts?"

Hagrid raised the letter again, causing the gathered flock of phoenixes to chatter their curiosity.

"What's Hogwarts? Best school of magic in the world, lads...and ladies?"

Looking around, Hagrid sat down on a nearby rock, taking care not to dislodge any of the feathery lumps covering him, and smiled as the littlest phoenix, Harry, came up to hop on his knee, "Well, it's a long story, but I suppose I should start by telling you about the human magical world..."

/Professor,/

/Found Harry. He's been changed quite a bit by living in the wild, but I'd say it's for the better. He's agreed to come to Hogwarts, he might just need a little tutoring when it comes to reading and writing./

/As a side note, I'd much appreciate it if you talked to Pomona about getting an aviary set up on the grounds, separate from the owlery. Harry's adoptive parents and friends are coming with him and while I don't want to spoil the surprise, let me tell you they're definitely bird-lovers./

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

  Sequel to Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them! Harry is captured by wizards and brought to a castle. The wizards are obnoxious, but there's a lovely wood nearby which is quaintly named the "Forbidden" Forest. Harry thinks that's adorable.
