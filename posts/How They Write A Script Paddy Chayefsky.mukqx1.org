Just helpful thoughts from thee time Oscar-winner for screenwriting: [[https://gointothestory.blcklst.com/how-they-write-a-script-paddy-chayefsky-f055905a15bf]]


** I love stuff like this! This is pretty general information for most people who've taken a writing course or read any kind of "how to" article, but it's really good information nonetheless. I'm quite rigid about a three act structure but freely admit that I don't trim the fat from fanfictions nearly as much as would be recommended because part of the fun is that I can let the characters have long conversations that wouldn't work in a piece intended for a commercial audience. I adore long conversations, and fanfiction is really the only place where I can get away with it.

If you're interested in a more detailed guide, I recommend "The Secrets of Story" by Matt Bird. You can find some general notes here: [[https://mentalpivot.com/book-notes-the-secrets-of-story-by-matt-bird/]]

I really enjoy the focus on characters. I think a big mistake a lot of early writers make is assuming that the plot is the most important part of the story. I love good, flawed characters, which is why I can enjoy something like Cursed Child with great characters but an awful plot more than Fantastic Beasts, which has a solid plot but just doesn't grab with its characters (other than Eddie Redmayne's smile, which can carry a whole series).

As a bonus, the author makes sure that his references and examples will be understandable to the majority of readers, which means that a lot of them come from Harry Potter because it's so widely read (or watched). Could not recommend more!

*** BTW, that abstract of Matt Bird's book is really awesome. I will need a lot more time to study it though.

And concerning Eddie Redmayne, it must be a man×woman thing. You are a lady, aren't you? I cannot care less about him (always prefer a niffler), but I liked more about Tina Goldstein (and strudel, but I always care for a strudel, we all care about it here a lot).

*** I think the plot IS the most /important/ thing, but certainly it is not /the only/ thing. Once you have a good plot (and most fanfiction stories don't even have that), you have to certainly start to work on characters. And yes, not cutting is [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/overall-post-on-breakfast-in-new-york.html][my super pet-peeve]].

**** There's nothing that's unimportant, but for me the order of operations in designing a story would be overall concept and theme, then you create the characters and get to know them so that you understand what is motivating them and how they'd make decisions, then hash out the plot itself. It's all a matter of preference, of course. I would prefer to read a bad plot with really fascinating characters who are acting in a true way than an interesting plot with flat characters. If you design the plot first and adhere to it strictly, then you'll probably hit a point where you're forcing characters to make decisions that move that plot forward rather than just letting them be themselves, which is my pet peeve.

***** I [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/harry-potter-and-dorothy-sayers.html][wrote]] about this quoting “[[https://www.fadedpage.com/showbook.php?pid=20140909][The Mind of the Maker]]” by Dorothy L. Sayers (yes, the author of the Lord Peter Wimsey detective stories), but it is exceedingly weird book and not for everybody (especially, if you cannot swallow a tract on The Holy Trinity). On the other hand, if you can read it, it is just a pure joy to read as any essay by good Oxford don of that era. Also, [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/whats-wrong-with-ginny.html][about a plot]] and [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/one-more-on-breakfast-in-new-york.html][conflict]].
