Does anyone else feel like Harry Potter isn't a good for writing Crossovers. It might (probably) just be the fandoms I'm most interested in. I just don't feel like it ever "fits" together. Anyway I would like to know your opinions about this.

Thanks


** I would argue quite the opposite. Between the Veil of Death giving a perfect excuse to throw people into alternate realities, the title of Master of Death allowing for convenient summoning mishaps (or just plain immorality and simply waiting for the new setting) and Hidden Society allowing HP to slot into nearly any contemporary setting with little fuss, plausibly in-universe excuses for a crossover, virtually /any/ crossover, abound.

Then add in that HP magic is ill-defined enough and the story covers all levels of magical education, it's not terribly difficult to set up things so the crossover worlds are of similar enough power levels (or roflstomp imbalance, if desired) to make for an interesting story.

HP is very flexible from a crossover standpoint.

** Honestly, I don't think I will ever understand this opinion.

It always seems to be laser focused on the idea that the settings need to be balanced in terms of their power, which is just... what? Why? If that was the case the /only/ crossovers which would be viable would be the completely ordinary settings/characters. As soon as you add powers or magic or high technology to the mix you'll start seeing areas in which one could trump the other completely.

Lets not even get into the fact that different people have very different interpretations of just how powerful each 'setting' is. It's the old Jedi vs Wizard debate, and the answer you come to as to which of those two is more 'powerful' in a direct confrontation depends entirely on how you integrate the governing powers of the two settings. Can Force users feel and influence magic spells/powers? Can they predict magic users in a battle? You can say 'no', of course and in that case a single wizard becomes much more powerful than any single Jedi, but that was a choice that did not have to be made. You could just have easily have said 'yes' and ended up with a crossover where wizards do not effortlessly outclass Force users.

Crossovers give a lot of freedom in just how you interpret the the two settings side-by-side because there is /no/ canon which specifies to what level Magic and the Force are mutually intelligible. You can do whatever you like with it, but like with all things which the writer can chose for their story, they do have to actually chose an interpretation that /works/ for the story they want to tell.

So, yes, if you want to write a 'awesome adventurer Harry and co charge around the Star Wars universe as bounty-hunters' story, it'll be completely robbed of stakes if nothing in Star Wars can threaten them, but it is the writer's decision to make those wizards unassailable, not a fundamental property of either setting.

And honestly, the focus on power levels is just... frustrating. Who cares if Harry in Westeros is ludicrously overpowered? Don't tell that story then. Find a different story to tell. One where being able to defeat people in a straight up fight is relatively unimportant. Game of Thrones is all about where Power resides, and how it can be used. Honestly, taking that to 11 by having a fully powered Wizard still unable to lead his nation into a prosperous future due to the petty squabbles of his vassals sounds interesting. Perhaps he's able to bring prosperity to everyone in his immediate view, but as soon as they're a few thousand miles away all bets surely are off. Hell, make the magic user the villain of the story even if they're not aware of it. There's no way running around reading minds and controlling people into peaceful prosperity isn't the act of a well-meaning villain.

Even in a non-crossover story, 'adventurer Harry defeating foes and taking names' is still only /one/ plot concept. It completely ignores pretty much everything else. Romance? Mystery? Horror? All of those are much more focused on the characters and their /knowledge/ than on their ability to kill things. None of those are especially impacted by power levels.

So, in conclusion, two points:

1. Harry Potter is only 'bad' for crossovers if you constrain yourself to a single adventure plotline, and deliberately make canon extrapolations which break the crossover setting.
2. All non-mundane settings have that same issue.

I think that comes from an overemphasis of "there must be conflict" in a story, combined with people thinking that conflict can only arise from a power imbalance.

Heck, a power imbalance can be a conflict in itself. I personally love a good power imbalance!

(Also, just because you can blow someone up, it doesn't make a romantic relationship with them any easier or harder.)

And very much lastly:

Even with that, I love myself a good curbstomp. It's just plain fun to see (from one story I remember) Harry and Ginny absolutely dominating the Helm's Deep Battle with some preparation. It's /fun/ to imagine being a badass hero sometimes, even if things go mostly right!

The conflict then arises from "what happened the last time I saw this?", and not from "what is happening right now," that juxtaposition can be a conflict and interesting.

This is why fanfiction is a different genre. Just like in romance you don't need a power struggle, you don't need one in fanfiction. Write to the strength of your genre!

*** One thing I really enjoy about Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past (not a crossover) is that although Harry is personally very powerful, with oversized magic and years of brutal experience of warfare - it rarely matters in the story. It's about him reconnecting with his friends, preparing them, and building a better life for when they succeed. The characters are really interesting, and there isn't a whole lot of direct combat. Even when there /is/ combat, it's typically overshadowed by the people; the first time we see Harry really get into a fight, it's a curb stomp, but that doesn't matter because the focus of the scene is reconnecting with Sirius, whom he just rescued. Fighting the basilisk is also short, but more importantly, it's done as a team.

Any setting can work, it's about how the author handles it.

** In terms of a magic or fight system... well, in my opinion, yeah. I made a comment a couple months back about it on another post.

#+begin_quote
  In my honest opinion, Harry Potter is generally a bad universe to crossover with. Its magic is versatile, so much so that it tops any other magic system despite it lacking the wide scale or heavy firepower that is often seen in other interpretations of magic. Its magic system only works with itself because the only enemies people have to face are also wizards. The magic the enemy uses is just as versatile as their own. The only universes I can think of that could possibly stand-up to HP would be comics, which constantly deal with characters (magical and non-magical) who can alter reality on a universal scale (characters like scarlet witch in Marvel, or the specter in DC). So vast majority, if not literally all, of the non-comics crossovers would get their shit kicked in pretty easily.

  Part of the reason HP magic is so versatile is that HP magic is trivialized, its usage has become such a massive part of their daily lives that they constantly use it for the most minor of things. It's rarely, if ever, portrayed as some mysterious cosmic force that they manipulate as opposed to something like the force in Star Wars, something that, while it isn't magic, still feels a lot more mystical in-universe than the way HP magic is portrayed.

  HP magic is used freely, for even the smallest of things, and because it's used for almost everything with generally very little difficulty or consequences, it can just do more than any other magic system you can find. This is a bad thing for crossovers, because their magic will never be as versatile as HP and the only way for them to keep up is to learn HP magic. Which destroys a significant part of the reason in making a crossover in the first place.

  At least, thats my opinion.

So, that's it. They can do near anything and getting hit with even a single spell can be crippling (jelly legs spell and that's if you want it to be painless) or immediately fatal (even without using the killing curse).

*** Interesting piece, and you're right, but I think good authors could still write a decent crossover.

For example, two Star Wars crossovers linkffn(Havoc Side of the Force; Unsuspecting Side of the Force) come to mind. Especially in the second one, the Jedi come to some rather blatant misconceptions about the scope of Harry's power since they don't have any context about his abilities, even though they've observed him for quite some time. At some point, one Jedi Master calls him the closest thing to a God a mortal can get or some such, and Yoda states that Obi-Wan (post Phantom Menace) confronting Harry would be suicidal for him.

They're still good stories though incomplete.

**** I'm sure a good author could but I feel that's part of the problem. It not impossible to make a good crossover story with HP, but given how difficult it is to write a good one, I think that fact speaks for itself that HP is generally a shitty choice of a crossover world. Decent crossover story with HP is if the fights aren't really that important to the story.

Now, I've never read either of those two stories but in the second one it still sounds like any SW character would lose in a landslide to any half decent wizard.

Also, I think the magic does matter quite a bit if the crossover story is going to have violent conflicts. Unless they're willing to convert to HP magic, the second universe in the Xover is very likely to have a really tough time of it if one HP spell can end them.

The best thing for the story would be to take this out of the equation by not having many fights.

***** What I mean is that the problem is much deeper and substantial than just type of magic (which is of course problem as well), that there is a difference between romantic and realist literature, and that Harry Potter (and the best fanfiction stories, e.g., Northumbrian ones) is more realist literature with magic than the romantic one (and that most fantasy literature is heavy romantic one).

****** So, you're saying that Harry Potter is low fantasy and doesn't mix well with high fantasy, right? Instead type of world that naturally exist in fantasy stories (kingdoms, knights, elves, etc.), the story takes place in a modern time and world. Even the high fatasy elements that are present (dragons, elves and so on) are held back by modern influence (dragons only live on dragon reserves taken care of by handlers, the wizarding world isn't part of a kingdom but instead run by a corrupt government with elected officials, people learn magic at schools and take exams, etc.).

Tbh, I think that's more to do with the feel of the story. Obviously, there are going to be clashes in the different vibes the two worlds give the reader but that's mostly because of the unique vibe the HP world has. Ignoring the magic fight issue, I think the story can work well enough if the writer is willing to let go of the feeling that the wizarding world has in vanilla HP (and if the reader is willing to forgive the absence of that feeling) and just ignore the fact that the story doesn't feel quite the same as vanilla HP.

So, the magic fight thing doesn't work in universe. While the high/low fantasy thing doesn't work from meta perspective.

******* Not really. I am thinking more about that quotation from Henry James:

#+begin_quote
  realism is what in some shape or form we might encounter, whereas romanticism is something we will never encounter.
#+end_quote

You are still too much focused on the magic. I am thinking more in terms of the story itself. Don't think about fantasy stories at all. Consider “[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivanhoe][Ivanhoe]]” by Walter Scott on the one side as a romantic story, and let's say “[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapped_%28novel%29][Kidnapped]]” by Robert Louis Stevenson. Both of them are adventure stories full of suspension and drama, both them of course completely Muggle and completely free of any magic, supernatural or whatever else. I would say that the key word which differentiates them is “*exceptional*”. Whereas “Ivanhoe” is the novel about exceptional people (Robin Hood and his merry men, king Richard the Lion Heart, king John, historic and thus exotic knights and princesses) doing exceptional things (saving the kingdom for the rightful king among other things), “Kidnapped” has the only historic event of any notice (Appin murder) in three paragraphs and it just an excuse in background for the rest of the story, which is about two completely insignificant (/sub specie aeternitatis/) persons doing something completely historically insignificant: saving their lives and freedom (and inheritance for David). Realist stories (despite the bad rap they got from /Middlemarch/, Balzac and similar stuff) don't have to be boring. I really like “[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_History_of_Mr_Polly][History of Mr Polly]]” by H. G. Wells, which is beautifully written story despite being about pub-owner mixed with a tramp and history of his unfortunate first marriage. In the same way similar good realist stories are also most detective stories (from Hercule Poirot to Law & Order), and I have also mentioned stories by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Ransome][Arthur Ransome]] (probably now mostly forgotten stories about children and their small adventures during their holidays) or Kipling's “[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalky_%26_Co.][Stalky & Co.]]”, the last one I think has to have some influence on JKR.

All fantasy novels and comics are in this perspective romantic stories, because all those Supermans, Batmans, Conans, etc., and the least problem they are willing to care for is saving of the whole world, nothing less. Harry Potter books are about saving the world from the potential evil overlord, true, but it is remarkable how incredibly normal (in good sense of the word) all characters are (with exception of Tom Riddle and Dumbledore). JKR managed brilliantly avoid [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/the-problem-of-peter-pevensie-and-the-problem-of-wands.html][The Problem of Peter Pevensie]] and the positive part of the incredibly convoluted resolution of the story (yes, the thing about the wand ownership is pure /deus ex machina/ pulled out the author's hat in the last few chapters of the book) is that in the end Harry is slightly battered, certainly more experienced, but quite distinctly seventeen year old young man, drop-out after the sixth year of Hogwarts, not a superhero.

It is obvious how much worse most super!Harry and crossovers with Marvel stories and similar end up, because they obviously didn't catch this difference (this atmosphere is perfectly kept by [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]] and it is one of reasons why his stories are so good, or for example stories by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/mzzbee/pseuds/mzzbee][mzzbee]]). It is also the reason how all Lord Potter stories fair poorly, because Harry Potter books and its characters are quite clearly middle class, inhabited by small businessmen, bureaucrats etc., not lords and ladies.

Good crossovers with Harry Potter are possible, but not with Marvel universe, but with very down to the earth and “realistic” stories (e.g., “Operation Wandless by EllianaDunla” linkao3(784221), which is mostly just a crime/espionage story crossed with “[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spooks_(TV_series][Spooks]])”) or perhaps with Sherlock Holmes stories.

******** HP only got famous in the first place because of its magic and its wizarding world. The story as a whole often tends to be iffy at best and only a couple of characters stand out as good or at least interesting characters.

I do think crossovers can be done (yes even in the marvel universe). You'd just have to do so without violent conflict. The problem with doing so is that it can limit the genres of stories written. And if you throw out the magic entirely there isn't much of what made HP special in the first place left in the story.

The story can be good without magic based conflict, yes, but look how many fanfic writers are actually out there trying to write muggle AUs versus all those who only write stories that still utilize magic. Besides, if I wanted to read a story with good characters who don't use magic, I'd go read fanfics of another damn fandom. If I had issues with magic in a story I would be reading fanfics of the most famous magical story of all time.

My issue is that magic is weapon through which all significant conflicts in the HP universe are fought with. Ya can't just discount it as a factor in any story with conflicts in it. One could just have a story without conflicts but honestly that tends to heavily limit the kinds of stories told.

Hell, nearly all the stories I read (that aren't crack or humor of some sort) have violent conflict in them. Call me a simpleton or whatever, but I am just not interested in reading a story without them. And considering how many HP fics do feature battles in them, the magic is very much an important factor since it's what they use to fight.

The genres that don't heavily feature violent conflict or focus strongly on magic are very character and plot focused and tbh outside of a few exceptions HP is pretty weak on both of those fronts. Whenever I /am/ in the mood to read about good characters or a good story, HP is not the fandom I'd be looking through.

  Harry Potter has no idea what to do. His new Auror recruits are nothing short of hopeless. Then an idea hits him..."So, let me get this straight: we're supposed to show some wand-waving weirdos how to do our job?""Yes, that is the general idea."Or: failing Auror recruits get dumped with MI-5 to get a lesson in how spying is really done, and with cooperating magical and Muggle terrorists on the loose, working together might just be a necessity anyway.Set in Spooks season 5 and after the Deathly Hallows, but before the epilogue of Harry Potter

** I feel certain fandoms cross over very nicely without much effort. For example Harry Potter cross over with Warcraft 3, Song of Ice and Fire/Game of thrones are really easy to set up because how well the fit together. ON the other hand it really doesnt fit with Mass Effect or even Naruto.

Also High School DxD can be used to fit any crossover from almost anywhere. List of my favourite Crossover fandoms for Harry Potter

- Warcraft
- GoT
- DxD
- Stargate
- Star wars

** Uh there is a reason why there are so many HP crossovers.\\
As previous speakers said, because it is a secret world an incredible amount is possible without the Veil of Death or the Hollows.\\
For example there are a lot of Avengers / Marvel crossovers or the ASoIaF / GoT as mentioned.\\
There are also good Star Wars crossovers, X-Men etc. In my opinion there is no other story base with so many crossover possibilities.

P.S. There are no good Twilight fic, crossover or the Original Books. The books alone border on a crime against humanity ".... Vampires, damn it dont glitter!" ;)

** I wrote about it [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/harry-potter-and-dorothy-sayers.html][on my blog]]. I think it is not specifically problem of crossovers generally, but what do you want to crossed it with. I mention two cross-over stories which work reasonably well, and from the top of my head I can remember “Sherlock Holmes and the Adventure of the Seventh Safeguard by Charlotte Ann Kent” linkffn(12447494), which works reasonably well as well.

** Sure, they might take a bit of work, but if you do it right, you can make a cohesive world out of pretty much anything. I think a lot of crossovers come off a little badly because they're not overly integrated. It takes a bit of thought to really make two worlds work together, but it can be done. Just gotta find the mesh point where they integrate most easily, then work outward from there. I managed to make a Life is Strange (Telltale-type game set in a Hipster Photography School in a Twee American Fishing Village) and Dead Space (Gore and psychological horror shooter in space with a tonne of monsters made from reanimated human flesh) crossover work pretty well, for example. :D

** I'm writing a HP/Warcraft crossover that I think ties them together rather well. One of the ways I'm welding the worlds together is that the warcraft magic users generally have a lot more power, living on a world with so much more magic in the air/ley-lines than Earth.

On the other hand, Harry's civilization has had to work with a lot less power, so their spells are much more efficient. They've explored much more of the powers of magic that require a gentle/light touch.

I'm also using the idea that overwhelming magical power can be countered to a point with overwhelming control. (Voldemort was stronger than Dumbledore, but Albus had extremely fine control over his spells.)

Basically, in chapter 4, a guy from Warcraft takes a look around and starts thinking "But what if I mix and match these styles of magic together?"

Crossovers can work with HP, but you have to find a good way to sew the worlds together. Or, just dump HP in another universe. (Or vice-versa.)

** Loved it for avatar the last Airbender.

Zuko and the philosopher's rock was hilarious and wonderfully written. I enjoyed book one but stopped after that for no fault on the crossover. It was just such a massive shame the author insisted on crossing it over with... tinkerbell (?) At the end if book 1 that turned me off.

** It's not particularly bad, the simple fact that the wizarding world is actively and effectively concealed allow it to slot into many urban settings and magic is interesting enough to drop into another setting through plot devices like the veil or random magical transport mishaps, have your character be sufficiently moral not to abuse the unforgivables (instant death and mind control are far too effective) and magic might not even be too overpowered.
