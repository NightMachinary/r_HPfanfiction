** Oh god, this is like those age-old "who would win in a fight" type of questions. But I think the real loser would be whoever is around them, cause I imagine them both putting aside their differences and insulting and belittling everyone else to tears. I hope a fic like this exists.

********* I did think of that at first but I already have a story about Aunt Marge at a wedding and I don't really think I could make it that different!

I have thought of a funny conflict between them though, so I think an awkward afternoon tea ought to do it. In regards to other characters there, I'm thinking:

-Colonel Fubster -Harry, obv, and Ginny -Perhaps Molly? I don't know why Harry and Ginny would agree to go on a dog walk with Aunt Muriel otherwise. This is the bit I'm struggling with. Maybe Bill and Fleur instead?

********** Harry: "Huh. Apparently Aunt Marge sent out a notice to everyone she knew, looking for dog-walkers. I believe it, she has enough of them."

Ginny: "Wow, I've never walked a dog! That will be fun, let's do it!"

Harry: "What? No. What? No!"

Ginny: "Yeah, we should totally do it! C'mon, Harry!"

Harry: "Ginny, no! This is not something we're doing!"

Ginny: "Please?!"

Harry: "No."

Ginny: "PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE-"

Harry: "Oh goddamnit, fine! But we /will/ regret this, mark my words."

********** Might I make a suggestion as to put Luna in there? If Marge and Muriel are going to meet and criticize everything in Creation, I'd love to see how Luna "Doesn't Give A Damn What Anyone Else Thinks of Her" Lovegood would have to say.

*********** I'm not sure how I could plausibly get her there. The chances of Marge and Muriel meeting are already slim to none, though I agree that would be entertaining.

I've started writing - Harry and Ginny cajoled into a dog walk with Muriel and Molly. I think adding more would be pushing it!

********** Only somewhat related, but have you heard of the "Colonel Fubster is a Death Eater" [[https://harrypotterrewind.wordpress.com/2010/06/03/colonel-fubster-death-eater/][theory]]? It's a little far-fetched but I feel like if one were to explore it it would likely end up with a darker and less comical story, although it would serve the purpose of connecting Marge directly with the wizarding world. (Not a request or anything, just a thought).
