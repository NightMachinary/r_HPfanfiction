Betrothal stories always seem to take one of two forms:

1. Harry discovers he is betrothed to Daphne Greengrass (or Susan Bones or Fleur Delacour or whoever). They're both upset about being forced to marry someone without having a choice, but soon discover they're absolutely perfect for each other and fall deeply in love and live happily ever after.

2. Harry discovers he is betrothed to the cruel and one-dimensional Ginny Weasley or Draco Malfoy or Severus Snape due to the evil machinations of Molly Weasley or Dumbledore or Voldemort. He says hell no and runs away with Hermione or whoever his true love is and does gringotts inheritance test lord potter grey harry cliche things and probably dumbledore and snape are forced to get married instead for some reason or something.

But I've almost never seen anything other than those two extremes happen. It's always either convenient true love or bashing, there's no middle ground. Are there any fics that have betrothals that don't have either extreme outcome?

(I think at one point I came across one one-shot fic whose name escapes me where Harry is betrothed to Daphne, but Harry's in love with Hermione and Daphne's a lesbian. They're perfectly civil toward each other but never magically fall in love. Are there any other stories where betrothals lead to outcomes along those lines?)


** oh shit I've read one like 4 years ago and now I dont remember the name :/

** Now exactly what you ask for but as close as I have read.

Harry/Daphne get married, and they respect each other and eventually more but in a gradual way. Disclaimer, I have not finished the story so I don't know if it gets better or worse.
