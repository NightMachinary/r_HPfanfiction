** If you make a recommendation thread at least try and explain why you're recommending it. As a cross over do we need to know the other universe or can we pick it up as we go along? What made it stand out? What is it similar to? Who would it appeal to? You've told us nothing about it or why you think we should read it.

*** Cheers bud for the good advice - I'll keep that in mind in future. Retrospectively I should have given way more info, haha. Cheers again for the tips mate.
