Are there any fics, where, for instance, evil!Dumbledore makes it look like Molly was potioning Harry to love Ginny as part of an evil plan to make him marry Daphne Greengrass?

The names don't matter. It just seems like a smarter long term solution to keep people apart to convince them their love is fake and make them doubt it than to try to dose them all the time, but I haven't seen it yet.


** This would be really interesting, I would also like to see the same kind of set up (Harry finds out someone is sneaking him potions and thinks it's love and/or loyalty potions) but it turns out it's nutrient potions because they were worried about him. That would actually fit Molly quite well.

** That's way too meta for someone to have written it. Sorry. When I get to my computer, I'll look though.

It is thought provoking though. I've asked a related question of someone getting portioned, then slowly weaned as conditioning. Good luck!
