couldn't you grab all the gold you have in your vault and use a time turner to go to the past to put the gold in the same vault?

late night thought


** The problem is after 100 loop, there are 98 versions of you who are completely broke, you who are in a timeline not of your own, clearly marked as a traveler from repeated excursions, and that timeline version of you who /are/ rich but can't trust you to not rob them. Cue 99 copies hunting you down

** What someone else said: that's not how time travel works in HP (ignoring Cursed Child). Time is a closed loop. Things have always been that way. If you've taken the money out of the bank, then there's never been any money there and no reason for you to travel back.

** The first thing that stands out to me is that it's the same amount of money being taken and added. Perhaps I should presume the money is in the past when you arrive meaning you double your vaults worth. I suppose it's feasible. Of course you got make sure to not meet yourself coming and going.

You also need to somehow deal with the goblins. Bankers always want to know where your money comes from. Then you have to deal with being poor bc future you took the money to the past. In the past the money accumulates but you have to take the money back in time to do that. Never leaving any money in the future.

** This is a very confusing thought. If i take a galleon from a table at 8 o'clock, go back in time 1 hour, and pocket that galleon at 7 o'clock I would have two gallons.

However say I wanted to see what my past self would do so I hang around the table hiding untill 8 o'clock. Now at this point my past self should have picked the galleon up, and went back in time. BUT THE GALLEON ISN'T THERE!! So my past self decides not to go back in time creating two different versions of me, one is 1h older than the other and I (the one that did time travel) has to hide his entire life from his younger twin.

The second scenario is me tanking a galleon from a table, going back in time and leaving it on the table for my past self to find. He does and pickes up both galleons and goes back in time, but i'm now lacking a galleon. Meanwhile back in the from 7:00 to 8:00 there is an exponentially increasing pile of money from all the time traveling and OH MY GOD THIS IS THE REASON TIME IS LINEAR!!!

Conclusion. You can't use a time turner for anything else other than taking extra clases and saving your godfathers from soul sucking horrors.

THE END!

*** the thing is that in the HP universe, I'm pretty sure it's canon that not only does every thing you do end up with the same ending, I.E no matter what you do there will be a galleon on that table, but if you do things that can't end up with that, time will straight erase you from existence (I'm pretty sure that's covered in PoA though it may just be a conversation of "you'll kill yourself" which I'm remembering wrong)
