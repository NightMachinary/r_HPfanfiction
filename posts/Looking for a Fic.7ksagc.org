I'm looking for a fic I read on FF.net a while ago, it was about Harry going back in time to like 10000 BC and he becomes Merlins son, but at first they can only speak parseltongue with each other. Thanks for the help!!

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!
