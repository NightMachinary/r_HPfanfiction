I've read a few Harry/Narcissa fics lately and was a bit disappointed that after they got down and dirty, the fic ended.

I'd like to read a fic in which they try to make that thing work up to the point of Harry asking for her hand and Draco getting a new half-sibling

If anything like that exists, pls tell me.


** Have you read Narcotic Effects By: Mehetabelo? It's probably one of the best ones I've read. However Draco doesn't get a half brother out of it.

I wouldn't mind a fic where Draco is forced to call Harry dad. It would be good for a laugh.

  Harry and Narcissa romance, several years after the battle for Hogwarts, Harry's marriage to Ginny is on the rocks, a chance meeting in Grimmauld place changes everything.

*** No, Harry gets Narcissa pregnant, ergo Draco gets a new sibling.

I never read that.
