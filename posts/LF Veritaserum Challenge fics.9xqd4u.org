So I found a really awesome fic linkffn(3205105) where the plot is that Harry cannot lie. The fic says that it was written for the Veritaserum Challenge, but I'm having a hard time figuring out where the challenge originated from or if there are more fics like it. Has anyone heard of this and can point me towards the original comm?

  Response to the Veritaserum Challenge. Starts PreHogwarts. Harry cannot lie, how does this affect him? And what happens when he meets an escapee from Azkaban?

** the only â€˜veritiserum challenge' I can find is here [[https://dmhgchallenge.livejournal.com/38863.html]] but it seems to be a Draco/Hermione group and asks for drabbles, so it may not be what you're looking for (tho I haven't read the fic), sorry! Hope you find it.
