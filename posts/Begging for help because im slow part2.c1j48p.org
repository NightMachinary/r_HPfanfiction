Ok so im back again asking for fic search help. Its this weird time travel story where hermione is either lilys twin, or just her younger sister. (She might not be either and im just losing it but im pretty sure theyre related in this one) Its not like Hermione purposely went back in time, she was more unknowingly reincarnated and so has these seer-esk visions and stuff that are actually her past life. Anyway, we find out that it was a ritiual made by Draco, Hermione (original one) and Harry to make Hermione Evans and shes upset that shes a product of magic and not reproduction or something (it probably makes more sense on the story than how im explaining it and i apologize.) On another note, it might be the same one where she's really talented at DADA and all the other subjects but doesnt try in her studies so she gets called out by Proffesor Dunbar or Burbage or whatever the defense proffessor was. I'd appreciate it if anyone can mention any fics that resemble these even vaguely.-- thanks:)


** Never mind the names i offered for the DADA teacherðŸ’€i realize one was a student and the other is the muggle studies prof. Oops
