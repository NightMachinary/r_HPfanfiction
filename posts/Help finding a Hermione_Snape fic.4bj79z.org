I only vaguely remember a piece of dialog. The story happens after the war. It goes something like Snape wants to know why Hermione never visited him in St. Mungo's. She says she did, but he doesn't remember it. She says he kicked her out. Insults her and he jokes that what he said doesn't seem so bad, compared to things he's said before. She gets a look on his face and he wants to know what he said (and he knows it was bad if it made her not try to visit him again) but she just tells him to forget it. I believe this conversation happens at Spinner's End.

Any help would be appreciated! I know it's not much to go off of, sorry.


** Perhaps linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Crystal of Time) where Snape is embarrassed to learn Hermione visited when he was high on drugs, and he slapped her on the arse, called her Gertie, and said she has lovely tits?

Aurette's Hermione always has amazing breasts, I think. That one is not my favorite of her fics, but I enjoyed it fairly well.

*** No, unfortunately that's not the story. The moment I mentioned was a bit angsty, though not too much, if I remember correctly.
