H/HR story, takes place after the Department of Mysteries battle. The thing I particularly remember was Harry and Hermione at a pool, at her house I think. I believe she's wearing a bikini and Harry notices the scar from the battle across her body.

Sorry, not much to go on, but its been bugging me I can't remember which fic this is from.


** This is a bit hard because Hermione having a pool (wearing a bikini, Harry noticing the changes in her body, etc, etc) was a popular thing for a couple of years in the H/Hr fandom so it could be any of hundreds of fics.

Do you remember any more details? Was it short or long? Did it have a plot or was it a fluff piece?

*** It wasn't a one-shot, it was lengthier. I'm pretty sure it had a plot, I don't usually read the fluffier fics.

I'm trying to remember any other stand out details but I'm coming up blank.

**** Were there any nicknames, unusual pets, or animagi forms? Were Ron, Ginny, and the other weasleys bashed? Dumbledore? Who taught defense against the dark arts the next year?

** A bit vague, there are a lot of stories with Hermione in a bikini and her battle scars and Harry being a typical teenage boy. Any other details?

*** That's all I have, unfortunately. Its been driving me nuts trying to remember it. I've been rereading a lot of fics trying to find a scene like that. I haven't gotten to Harry Potter and the Fifth Element yet, do you happen to know if it had that in it?

** Was this a fic taking place at the Burrow? With Fleur, Bill, Harry, Ginny and Ron all there?

*** I don't think this scene was at the Burrow, because I remember a pool and not a pond.

**** Nevermind, I was thinking of a long fic with smut called A Boon for Bill. H/Hr and Bill/Fleur were the main pairings in that.

*** Never done this before, but could it be linkffn(No Thanks by old-crow).

Now that I think about it more, I don't think this is the one I had in mind. Hmmm.
