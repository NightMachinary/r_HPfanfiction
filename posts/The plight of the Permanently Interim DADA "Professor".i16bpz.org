Almost every year the DADA professor manages to leave before completing his duties, one of which is checking the rolls of parchment written by students attempting exams other than their O.W.L.s and N.E.W.T.s. He has been enticed to the position many times and with greater rewards promised at every subsequent turn -- but he refuses them all. He tries to leave the position, but he is never able to!
