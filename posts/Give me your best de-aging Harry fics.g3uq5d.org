I was re-reading These Cuts I Have by Melindaleo and they have a couple of chapters of a deaged Harry - which was the best I've ever read.

Can you tell me some of you favourites? Thanks

** I second A Change in Perspective, which is my favorite de-aging fic.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/14893][Redefining Life series]] by OliverSnape

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8707789][Six, Revisited]] by Warviben

And for a change, somebody besides Harry gets deaged in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8207456][To the Moon]] by VCCV (aka Constant Vigilance)

ETA: OMG how could I forget [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1465900][The Living Years]] by Dementor Delta?

** Will you read deaged Snape being raised by Harry? I know of a great series and a wonderful standalone!

** Time Storm by Shedoc is another great de-aged Harry fic! [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1947047/1/Time_Storm]]

This is a de-aged Harry/Draco fic but it has some themes that may not be for everyone! [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2388416/1/Growing-Pains]] Growing Pains by Sensiblytainted

** I only started Away Childish Things but it's very good so far. Harry is de-aged to ten (memories too) so he knows nothing about the magical world and the way Draco handles the situation is very sweet.

*** THIS is one of my favourite stories of ALL time!

It's completely ruined any other deaged fic I've come across ðŸ˜ª (I think I've sadly checked out all the others listed here, but this one is just a whole other level.)
