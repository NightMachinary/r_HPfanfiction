*** You have some impressive fortitude that upon finishing this story, you actually thought "wow, I would read this again". It's just so /heavy/ on words. Thousands and thousands of needlessly bloated words, describing the same formulaic thought patterns over and over again. Harry does something, Good Guy (Ahsoka) reacts, Neutral Guy (Aayla) reacts, Bad Guy (Jedi Order) reacts. Over and over and over. Like, there's something like 50K words of this stuff just in one travel period. I really don't see what anyone else sees in this fic, except a bunch of squandered potential.

**** Interesting viewpoint. You see formulaic. I personally see excellent, deeply flawed characters, all written with diverse motivations, with intrinsic conflict between them. If you feel that Harry is always the good guy in this story, you're most definitely wrong. Moreover, I see character growth from all of the main cast, including Harry.

If long form character analysis and growth aren't your cup of tea, I can imagine you wouldn't enjoy it, though I personally feel that "needlessly bloated" is a pretty extreme reaction.

That said, read what you want. If you really don't like it, write a better version of it.

Edit: Upvoting your comment for thoughtful critique. I disagree with you, but you gave a proper critique, which should be noted.

***** I didn't say anything about Harry being the good guy. My main point is that the story is just plain boring. Economy of words is very important, but the author spends 20k words to tell something that could have been done in 3k, and then repeats it a few times from different viewpoints. That's not nuance, that's just overkill. It just feels like any number of indy!Harry stories where Harry suddenly takes his destiny into his own hands, unknowingly starts making waves with his powers, while developing a small group of arbitrarily devoted followers.

As for writing one myself, I tried. The lack of Star Wars knowledge (and the lack of writing skill) sort of doomed it from the start.

The Mirror of Maybe is incomplete and will remain so, but what IS written is great. I believe the most chapters(20) are updated on the authors own website, an easy google search will bring it up.

Ignore the grammar as it isn't their first language and actually works well with the fic later on. The story is seriously philosophical with original ideas all over the place and very few if any tropes.

Also Black Comedy as already mentioned, great story :D
