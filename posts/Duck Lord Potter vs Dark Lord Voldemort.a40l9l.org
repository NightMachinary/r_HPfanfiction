Harry misreads and Article due to his bad eyesight and his prescription needing an update. He reads about the Wizarding World claiming him as the new Duck Lord. Deciding that's fairly tame, he decides to go with it. Getting an Army of Ducks, and fighting like a Gear Master from Dragon Nest (They have Ducks trained to operate Gun Turrets, and cast spells, why can't Harry)

No pairing, Harry x Luna (She'd buy into the insanity) or Harry x Commelina (The Academic character from Dragon Nest)

Hermione assumes the Ducks are slaves and starts a group similar to Spew. Something like USED (United Society for the Emancipation of Ducks) or Stud (Stop Tormenting Underprivileged Ducks)

Voldemort assumes Harry has lost his mind in the Graveyard battle when Harry summons Ducks, but the Death Eaters start dropping (Harry can break Gamps law, but only to transfigure people into bread)

Ducks are the Power the Dark Lord knows not. It turns out that Harry accidentally transfigured one of his toys in his Cot into a Duck, that blocked the Avada and reflected it. No Horcrux for Harry (Or you can have the Ducks magically remove it)


** I also want to see horde of rubber ducks taking on the Dark Lord.

** I'm picturing a death eater dying because he didn't take cover.

"DUCK!" yelled Malfoy.

"I KNOW!" Nott screamed back, before dying in a mess of feathers, blood, and skull fragments.

Harry grinned. The spell to conjure rocket-propelled kinetic-kill ducks was a game-changer.

EDIT TO ADD: if you're not picturing rocket-propelled kinetic-kill ducks as wearing little leather flying helmets and aviator goggles you're not doing it right.

** "Yeah, so I'm homeless now," Harry said while sliding the train's compartment door closed.

"WHAT?!" Ron and Hermione both gasped. Harry shrugged.

"It's not so bad. I get more exercise and I'm out in the sun more, plus I'm kind of a Duck Lord." Ron was just staring with his mouth open, half a chocolate frog melting precariously off his lips. Hermione /had/ noticed that Harry was far less pale and looked healthier all around than last year. His hair was still a mess, though. Kind of like a bird's nest.

"Ronald! That's disgusting." Hermione scolded before turning back to Harry: "Honestly, Harry, you could stay with either of us if the situation is that bad. It wouldn't be trouble. Why didn't you tell the headmaster or professor McGonagall things were so bad at home? Also, that was just a stupid misprint in The Prophet, you aren't a /Duck Lord/." Hermione rolled her eyes. Harry looked remarkably calm about his situation.

"Sure I am, Hermione. Dumbledore seemed pretty insistent that I stay with the Dursleys, but he's never checked up on me. I feel kind of bad not saying anything, but at the same time, don't you think /someone/ should have made sure The-Boy-Who-Lived was actually, you know, alive?" Hermione, was for once, speechless. "Also, about the ducks...." Harry sheepishly grinned, opening his school robes, revealing dozens of tiny water fowl. The birds seemed upset at being woken up and immediately filled the compartment with angry chirps.

"Turns out," Harry explained, "When I read that issue of the Prophet, my magic sort of latched onto it. Everything started making sense. I figured out how to shrink the ducks, I got a self-cleaning robe with an infinite number of pockets, and the ducks /really/ like me. I'm a Duck Lord, guys."

"Mate, that's bloody wicked and all, but how do you do magic over the summer?"

"Yeah," Harry smiled, "turns out Aurors are kind of dumb. They show up to the park I stay at whenever some underage magic happens, look around, get confused, get attacked by a horde of angry ducks, and then leave. I don't think anyone expects a famous, Voldemort-defeating wizard to be homeless. Owls can still find me, though." Harry's friends were just staring now, wide eyed.

"Oh, yeah," Harry closed his robes and looked up at his two best friends, hope in his green eyes. "Do you guys know if there are ducks at the Hogwarts lake?"

--------------

"Ducks." Dark Lord Voldemort sat on his thrown in Malfoy Manor, thoroughly confused at the visions he had garnered through his accidental horcrux. His Death Eaters didn't know what to make of it.

"Perhaps it's a metaphor," one of them supplied, kissing his robes. Voldemort didn't recognize the man through the mask, so he absently offered a /CRUCIO/ and left him writhing on the floor.

"Is there a chance," Voldemort knew this voice was Snape's from the low drawl, "that he has learned some form of Occlumency at the school." Voldemort raised a non-existent eyebrow.

"And who could have filled his mind with.... /DUCK/ magic?" Snape snapped up, silently apologetic.

"I'm not sure, my Lord, but he has been behaving far more strangely this year." Voldemort waved a dismissing hand.

"Whatever, let's get this prophecy and see what it entails." The Death Eaters left the manor in force, except for the man whimpering on the marble floor.

--------------

"Aaaaaaah!" Bellatrix charged through the Department of Mysteries, whipping fire around her to shield from all pecking ducks that angrily attacked her. There were SO MANY DUCKS! "What the bloody hell is this?!" The teenager stalked her, calmly, surrounded by flaming feathers.

"Yeah, I wouldn't use fire if I were you. They're protected from it, but their feathers break the charm once they're loose." The boy was surrounded by a whirlwind of flaming feathers, like a hurricane of Phoenixes, waving his wand about and casting magic Bellatrix Lestrange had never known.

"I trained them," Harry Potter explained in his dumb, calm voice. "I trained them to attack the skull masks, and the dark mark, and all known Death Eaters, and Severus Snape."

"What?!" Someone cried. Bellatrix wasn't listening. The ducks were EVERYWHERE. They pecked through her shields, at her eyes and wrists and they invaded her robes. They were all over. The boy was commanding HUNDREDS OF DUCKS. How was this possible?

At first she thought them summoned creatures, a sort of funny joke. She laughed at the army of feathered fowl turning the ministry into a sea of messy bird poop and feathers, but when she whipped her wand to dismiss them, they persisted. They weren't illusions, or magical constructs, either. They were ACTUAL DUCKS.

Who knew ducks could be so vicious?

"AAAAAAAAAAH!" She screamed, bleeding and burnt. Bella had enough and threw all of her magic into a shield, surrounding herself in a bubble. There was a brief respite from the sharp beaks and talons as her cousin taunted her.

"Enjoy Azkaban, cousin?" Sirious' mocking gaze met her own frustrated one. "They never served /me/ pecking duck, but I see you have enough to share." She threw a curse at the man, but a duck intercepted it, blasted into the arched veil emanating in dark whispers.

NO! Not whispers. Quacks. Two ducks popped out of the magical archway where there was one before.

"Neat." Harry ordered some more ducks into the magical construct, and they returned, doubling in number each time.

"NO!"

"Yes," Harry Potter stepped up to her. He was within arm's reach. He couldn't dodge a Killing Curse at this range. "I'm afraid you're surrounded. Better just give up."

"Never." The Dark Lord entered the atrium with a thunderclap of magic, and sent the ducks fluttering afoul. The snake-like wizard hovered down to floor level, raw magic pouring out of him. "I will hear that prophecy in full tonight, whether it is from your lips or Dumbledore's. CALL HIM!" The atrium shuddered with magic, and Harry's rapidly growing army of ducks formed a circle around him. Harry stepped forward, ignoring Bellatrix, much to her anger.

"I don't think you want to do this, Dark Lord." Harry was calm, collected, and seemed almost bored at his challenge thrust before Voldemort.

"You think this power adequate?" Was the Dark Lord's answer waving a lazy hand at hundreds of birds surrounding them. Harry shrugged.

"It's the power you have not, isn't it?" Harry raised his wand. The Dark Lord adopted a dueling stance in kind.

"Looking for a rematch, are we?" Voldemort mocked. His opponent, The Boy-Who-Lived just smiled.

"I've learned a thing or two. Say, would you rather fight an army of duck-sized horses, or any army of horse-sized, magically strengthened ducks?" Suddenly, all the ducks, ALL OF THE HUNDREDS DUCKS, transformed to be giant-sized with a series of /pop/s! The ministry atrium suddenly seemed very small.

"Sorry," Potter said. "Trick question. You're fighting my army of horse-sized ducks. Good luck."

** Honestly, this just reminds me of that part of /Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived/ where they briefly face duck based conquest.

#+begin_quote
  Calypso laughed and smiled softly at Harry. “Did he ever tell you about the duck incident when he was first learning how to make a receptacle for the space enhancement charm?”

  Harry felt his face suddenly pale. “Calypso, you and Viktor promised!”

  “I believe that you told us to never mention it; however, I don't think we ever agreed to anything.”

  Groaning, Harry sagged into his chair as Calypso began to tell the story. Glancing up, he couldn't help but notice the happy and grinning faces around the table. Compared to how the evening could have gone, a little embarrassment wasn't that bad.

  “... and then the ducks just start to multiply, and Harry screams, 'Go get Professor Kosarev before they take over!'”

** I don't know the name of the fic off the top of my head but there I read one where he creates a duck as a guardian animal in his mindscape. He creates more and more and they develop independent personalities. He eventually creates some golems and forces the personalities in them so that they can destroy things in the real world.
