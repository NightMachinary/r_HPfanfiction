As the title says I'm looking for fics where there is interaction between Harry and a female version of Harry. I find there can be so many interresting and/or humorous situations that could be found with 2 different Harry's interacting. (Throw in luna and im such it could be nothing but a crack fic!)

Could be in the style of dimension travel, that harry meets his female counterpart adopts or saves them from dursleys, protects them from others manipulations etc.

Or even fics where Harry has a magical accident or is cloned and end up with a female double.

As long as there is no slash, i dont mind the pairings (even harry/fem!harry)

This is the best of the bunch probably. Killer writing style, great characterization, flowing plot, wholesome Divination techniques, probably my favorite Harry/Tonks depiction.

Unfortunately the author engaged in some tomfoolery with a patreon account; people didn't like that and weren't shy in telling him so. And he stopped writing. Bummer.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP

**** From what I recall, sort of? [[/spoiler][They want him to fight Voldemort and can't really understand why he wouldn't, even if they were wrong to do what they did. And Harry does not approve of Voldemort or Voldemort's actions in the slightest, but he doesn't want to reward the Order of the Phoenix for stealing him away from his dimension. Both sides seem fairly reasonable, imo, so I personally never found it all that annoying.]]

** I remember a Harry/Fleur fic with that premise that I really liked but I can't seem to find it anymore.

It was an older Harry somehow ending up in fem!Harrys world. I don't quite remember why or how but it had a very nice feel to it.

If anyone can find it i'd be very grateful, I'll keep looking just in case and will post the link if i do find it.

Edit: I actually found it quite quickyl right after making this post: linkffn(12446118) The summary is kinda shitty and I really only remember that I liked it but my standards are pretty low so take it with a grain of salt.
