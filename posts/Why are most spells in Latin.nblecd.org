Why not Scottish Gaelic, Celtic, Welsh, heck even some parts could have old Danish spells in the Danelaw areas. The more I read about the British Isles the more apparent it becomes there are (or were) lots of languages spoken there. So why all the Latin? I guess because that's what most of the /written/ record consists of. Literate people were writing in Latin. So recorded spells would be in that language. It would be fun if some spells had been passed down through families though, that were in different languages. Thoughts?
