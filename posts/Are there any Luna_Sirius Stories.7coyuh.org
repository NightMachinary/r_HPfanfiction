This is a pure curiosity thing that my brain is stuck on after reading a passage in the current fan fiction I am reading.

Are there any Luna/Sirius stories? Obviously, it would probably be time travel or Luna aged up, or future Luna/Sirius.

I know Hermione has been paired a lot with Marauders via time travel or whatnot, but Luna is one of my favorite characters to read (usually), and so I am curious. I'm guessing they don't exist but never hurts to ask.
