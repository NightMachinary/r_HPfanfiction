Looking for fics where Harry is raised as a member of the house of black. Stories where Harry is older are preferred

No slash please


** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11488906/1/Potter-vs-Paradox][Potter vs Paradox by Belial666]] linkffn(11488906) adult Female Harry goes back in time and becomes Harry's 6 year old temporal twin, Iris Black, who then takes aging potions to become 11. She's adopted by Arcturus and Melania and they work together to defeat Voldemort. Even though she's 11, she acts with an adult's independence and skill and doesn't give a damn about anyone else's expectations. It's a fun read.

​

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12450594/1/Raven-of-Durmstrang][Raven of Durmstrang by Verkos]] Harry is raised by Dorea Black Potter and they pretend he's the son of Regulus. It's a wbwl fic with Lily and James bashing. linkffn(12450594)

​

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189937?view_full_work=true][Black, in the Smothering Dark by zeitgeistic (faire_weather)]] linkao3(189937) Harry is really Sirius' son and Sirius didn't actually die in the Veil.

​

(Sorry, I recced The Dead Master without noticing your no slash request. The bot picked it up before I could remove it. It's a Harry/Snape fic so probably not your cup of tea.)

  Dumbledore's schemes took everything from him, including the man he loved, but now Harry has devised a means with which to travel back in time to his younger body before he started Hogwarts. He's going to get another chance at his life, and this time Dumbledore won't be getting in his way.An unconventional approach to a Do Over story.WARNING: This story is a W.I.P. It is not finished. It may never be finished. Updates will be sporadic. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.

  The Girl-Who-Lived won; Magical Britain never recovered. As their world grows closer to another war, the surviving DA members concoct an elaborate plan that will see Iris Potter back in time to guide her younger self and prevent the war from ever happening. Fate however has other plans. GWL BWL, dark!Harry, timetravel, canon magic.

  Hadrian Black is entering his fourth year at Durmstrang Institute, and looking forward to it. He has excelled during his time there, and hopes to bring pride to not only his aunt, but his school as well. And, he has been given the chance with the reemergence of Triwizard Tournament, only problem it is being held at Hogwarts. Rated T.

**** linkffn(11653847) has some weird blood adoption going, and a sex-change as part of some botched childhood ritual. That aspect is handled surprisingly well.

linkffn(12745758) Harry is adopted by Andromeda after the Third Year. She gets the Black Lordship soon afterwards, but does not care much about it. Overall family/friendship focused and rather slice-of-life like.

linkffn(11637611) Fem OP!Harry crack which starts out dark and becomes very fluffy after chapter 7/8. Sirius gets the headship, Walburga's portrait trains Harry. A good Hermione redemption arc.

  Harry felt he had lost his chance at family after watching Sirius fly away only for his godfather to show up during the summer. Sirius teaches Harry what he needs to know, helping him become the true Lord Potter. Then the Tri-Wiz comes and the deepest, darkest secret of the Marauders is revealed - Harry was born the daughter of Lily and Sirius. Eventual Fem!HarryxTonks

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.

  The war against the Dark Lord was the last straw. The oppressed, fed up with oligarchy, corruption, and injustice, sharpened their knives, rallying behind those who promised change. They won.
