*** In my opinion, it's exceedingly mediocre. There's nothing really wrong about it, it just feels very amateurish. It's not enough to make it not worth recommending, but you are consistently reminded that you are reading fanfiction as you are reading it

*** Way too angsty for me, which is tougher when it starts from the very beginning, making it hard to care about the characters at all.

*** It's worth a read imo, yeah it feels a little unpolished but fanfiction is fanfiction

*** I'm not bothering with spoiler tags since Chrome is escaping the parens since the new look-and-feel.

Staying super-generic: Hogwarts falls. Dumbledore asks Fleur with his dying breath to take care of Harry. She does. He trains and, eventually, starts to fight back. Along the way is an angsty romance of sorts between the two.

** I thought it was someone reposting the story, cuz I didn't remember the author's name. And I don't remember if I read the whole thing or stopped halfway through it.
