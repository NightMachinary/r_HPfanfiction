Hi

I'm looking for Severus/Narcissa fanfics. I'm not particularly picky about the timeframe of the fic, or if it respects the canon ages of the characters. I don't have a problem with AU neither.

Thanks in advance :)

  Snape makes a deal with Slytherin's most popular witch, the beautiful and witty Narcissa Black, after she offers to help him win back Lily Evans. But what's the cost of her assistance? Will the 2 become freinds, or is Snape simply dancing with the Devil?

** Can anyone remember the fic with the rebels from S America fighting against Harry and the Catholic church through some kind of Super!Floo? That was Snape/Cissa
