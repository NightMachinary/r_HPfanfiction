Title says it all.

Over 70k+ words please.


** Given that the Chamber had no secondary exit, it was probably more suited as a secure storage room than a secret command center.

Because of its secluded location, the Chamber could further be heavily booby trapped.

**** Even our intrepid unreliable narrator would probably notice a giant staircase, and use it rather than having Fawkes carry them up the pipes. That said, I think that all we can say for sure from canon is that any other exits are non-obvious as Harry doesn't make mention of them. There's plenty of wiggle room for other hidden means of egress that require parseltongue to open or other such things.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  6/7th year fic. Harry decides he wants to do things his way, because Dumbledore's method of defeating Voldemort just doesn't appeal. He finds friends in unexpected places and embarks on a method of defeat in which he sometimes holds little hope. H/OFC.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.
