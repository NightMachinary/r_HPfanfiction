Hi Everyone :) Ive been lurking around this sub for a while now. I feel like I must have read 1000s of fanfictions but Im sure there are some more great ones! I am looking for some snape adopts/mentors/is the father of harry fanfictions. Preferably long and complete, but I'm happy to try anything!

Also, any fan fictions where harry is hurt and has a long recovery process? I recently read Moment of Impact by Suite Sambo and it was really good.

Thanks! Xxx


** My favorite fic ever is "Circumstance" by Libellule. Family Night is also a good one.

** Hi, I am finishing binge read this one : [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/288212/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Psychic-Serpent]]

It's alternatives 5-6-7th books, written in 2001 so right after the publication of the goblet of fire. You'll have a "snape adopts/mentors/is the father of harry", news spells, animaguses, and Quidditch ! but I can't say more without spoil you the story ;)

Enjoy :)

  What if Snape survived the final battle, but his innocence was not discovered? Epilogue: He sighed, and said slowly, “I would prefer to hear that... that Voldemort... does not have control over anything anymore, not even a single person's life.”

**** Probably, but the spankings don't actually hurt it's just a tap like someone would tap your shoulder to get your attention. but som people dont like that either. I don't mind it. Some times talking and grounding and coddling your kids doesn't help. I was an awful child, nothing you could say or ground me with did aything. I'd do what I want. Put me in timeouts? Oh ok i walked out and did what I wanted, even if you put me back there, i'd walk out again. tried to do it the super nanny style, still never gave up.

Try grounding me? What are you going to do tie me up in my room to stop me from going out? Nah I'll go out. You would have to physically stop me from going, even then I used to shove my way through. Took away something I like? I'd steal it etc.

So I don't believe from my own experience that talking and grounding and all the soft mushy ways of discipline always work for every child.

***** lets agree to diagree here.

i would never hurt a child and im pretty sure i would have found a way to sanction your behaviour without violence

if its just like a tap on your shoulder to get your intention why did it work better than timeouts and grounding ?

hitting your child (where do you draw the line between hitting, smacking, spanking, „tapping“ btw ?) can severly damage a child and negatively influence the relationship to his parents, authority in general and other people

in addition its illegal where i live, if someone finds out your kids might get taken away

****** Yes, we'll have to. Cause yelling at a child could also just as easily damage them. I still get frightened when people raise their voices. So should people not even raise their voices? Where do you draw the line on over-sheltering them? Making them sit in a chair for 30 minutes while you speak softly to them does nothing in my experience. The line can be drawn with spanking/tapping, and it is where I'm from. It can not leave a mark, or cause any internal or external injury. It can only be the rear, not any other part of the body, and only the parent's hand can be used.

The only thing that made me hate my family very much was getting screamed at and slapped in the face every time I said something sarcastic or they misinterpreted something I said. One time I said, "I know" and my mother heard 'No' and i had a bruise on my cheek for a few days. lol. Thats not a spanking thats just hitting to hit. Big difference.

I guess it all depends on where you come from, and individually how the parent was raised, and the environment which the kid was raised in. It's interesting really, I'd love to do cross-country studies, and international studies on that to compare. It'd be fascinating. But thats the old psychology geek in me.

I don't mind others views, I'm sorry if I came off snippy before, I didn't mean to. Your opinion is just as valid and important as mine or anyone elses. So it doesn't bother me that we disagree. I don't want any hard feelings or anything.
