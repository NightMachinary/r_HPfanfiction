#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.

** It's hard because Severus is the most common cross-gen pairing for her. But her relationship with Sirius in [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/10772496/1/The-Debt-of-Time][A Debt of Time]] is cross gen as well - at least in the first section and then again at the end.

** Lucius/Hermione :

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3494886/1/Eden][Eden]] is super, super dark. Seriously. But really good. It's actually the first fanfic I read, and I'm still blown away when I read it. It's just incredible.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4885321/1/Discovering-Beauty][Discovering Beauty]] (long story with fun and sad moments, and smut) and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11506670/1/Driving-Miss-Granger][Driving Miss Granger]] (short, mostly smut) between others, same author, different stories. I liked some of her other works too.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2506055/chapters/5564747][Muggle Studies]] was good too.

Mizsphinx is a good author too, especially [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5064796/chapters/11647993][Debtors and Collectors]] & [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5048518/chapters/11608999][Penfriends]] (one of my fav, actually)

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/359255/chapters/582284][A Comedy of Manors]] Very funny, intelligent and well written.

I probably have more if you'd like.

--------------

Hermione/Voldemort (yeah, I know, it's not for everyone, but I absolutely love it) :

Anything by LadyMiya, but my all time favorite is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/451982/chapters/775208][Shared Flame]] . She has more fics on ffnet IIRC.

Lunalelle has a very dark story, and an equally dark sequel, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2074249/1/Abyss][Abyss]] is the first one, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2333072/1/Ascent][Ascent]] is the sequel. Super dark (rape and torture, to name a few).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7499274/1/The-Scientist][The Scientist]] by Uchiha.s is super AU (no magic, etc), but extremely good. Like, really, really good.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/users/NerysDax/pseuds/NerysDax][Nerys]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Sharkdiver1980/pseuds/Sharkdiver1980][Sharkdiver1980]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/WildKitsune/pseuds/WildKitsune][WildKitsune]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/SerpentInRed/pseuds/SerpentInRed][SerpentInRed]] are other authors I have read and enjoyed.

  She mustn't be seen. It was the oldest rule of time travel yet one of the hardest to follow. Hermione is thrown back to the start of her third year and the professor who'd always been there for her. Now with Sirius escaped from prison and Remus' entire past before him again, can she be there for him? And what happens once the year is over? WINNER BEST DRAMA MARAUDER MEDALS 2016!

Desperation and a chance encounter lead her into the employ of the three Black sisters. She finds herself caught in their deadly web, helplessly waiting to see who will reach her first.
