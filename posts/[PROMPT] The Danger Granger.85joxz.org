So Hermione, rather than being a stickler for the rules, figures out ways to break the spirit of the rules without breaking the words of them. She has unhealthily gryffindorish tendencies and an active desire to have fun. She turns her vast intellect to the art of sarcasm and sass, and just coasts on her sheer brainpower in terms of classwork.

I'd go for a Harry-Hermione-Luna trio, because thats always fun (pls not an actual relationship tho). Luna just tends to appear in the Gryffindor common room and hangs out with them, I guess?


** [Following is a mix of canon, WoG, and my headcanon] HG all but worships the rules, in letter and spirit, because her childhood was such that her only 'friends' were adults, specifically authority figures, and rules were how she gained their approval, alleviating her loneliness somewhat.

In canon, she changed as a result of a series of major betrayals by authority (i.e. Quirrell, Lockhart, Fudge (and by extension the Ministry (WRT Sirius and Buckbeak)), the law itself (House Elves), the Ministry, & Umbridge.

However, she was not truly changed until fifth year, with the denials of the Ministry and Umbridge. The prior betrayals either were not directly witnessed by her (Quirrell and Lockhart) or were... excusable by someone who did not want to lose their faith.

Therefore, in order to create this AU Hermione, you need to change her childhood such that she does not develop that faith, or loses it early.

The easiest way to do that without changing her too much is to simply have at least one authority figure fail her.

For example, you could have her, suffering from bullies, try to get help from a teacher or administrator, and for whatever reason be rebuffed. This rejection could then break her trust in authority, and she thus rebels against those who have betrayed her by twisting their rules to her benefit - perhaps as her own bullies did to her (for example, if they taunted her until she lashed out, and then got her in trouble for initiating a physical encounter).

*** Hermione doesn't worship rules. She breaks them in canon whenever they get in the way - her way. Harry under attack? Set a teacher on fire. Suspect a fellow student of being the heir of Slytherin? Steal ingredients to illegally brew a potion to impersonate students who you plan to drug and kidnap. Government affecting your education negatively? Found an illegal study group.

**** Aiding an escaped prisoner, mind wiping her parents, interfering in team selection, being rudely critical of a teacher and spectacularly dropping the class, permanently disfiguring a classmate for telling on them, punching out a classmate, kidnapping a reporter and keeping her prisoner... The girl is downright scary. That cute/funny story where she is Harry's Bellatrix is not far off the mark even with canon characterization.

Ginny has more in common with Bellatrix though.

**** I agree but I think it is more she does worship the rules but she care more about her friends because she did not have them before she she will willing to brake them if it means in her opinion that they might leave her if she does not. Leaving her can mean dead or just not being her friend.

*** Looking at when Hermione follows the rules and when she doesn't, her attitude is to follow a rule when she thinks the rule is a good idea, and completely ignore rules when she doesn't. In contrast, Harry's and Ron's attitude is to break any and all rules on a whim, without regard for consequences. In contrast to /that/, sure, she looks like a rule-worshipper, but so would any reasonably level-headed individual.

Examples:

1. /Don't wander around Hogwarts at night:/ Good idea, because Harry's preadolescent honour is not worth the risk of, say, running into a hungry cerebrus.
2. /Don't ride brooms without an teacher present:/ Good idea, because a kid just broke his arm falling off a broom, and Harry, for one, has no idea how good at riding he actually is. Draco is "stealing" the Remembrall in front of two dozen witnesses, so he isn't going to get away with it.
3. /Don't assault teachers, and especially not by setting them on fire:/ Bad idea, since said teacher is trying to murder my friend. Burn the +witch+ wizard!
4. /Don't steal potions ingredients and secretly brew and then ingest a highly complex potion in order to ambush and abduct several students in order to impersonate them while sneaking into a rival House's common room in order to interrogate their friend:/ You get the idea.

*** I think her following rules has almost nothing with her lone childhood. Excellence syndrome isn't so rare and mostly related with parents' high expectations.

Moreover if she's observant she should notice that adults constantly break their own rules (don't drink alcohol, don't smoke, don't swear, don't be lazy, etc.).

** linkffn(Parselmouth of Gryffindor) Hermione's ability to talk to snakes breaks her trust in authority because none of her books say anything about the intelligence of snakes, something she knows is fact.

The madness only grows from there.

  A tiny change in the Granger family tree means Hermione is now a Parselmouth when she starts Hogwarts. Changes pile up as foes are defeated, friends are made, secrets are uncovered, and loopholes are delightfully abused.

  Hermione life suddenly changes, courtesy of an experiment conducted by herself from an alternate, future universe. You'd think messages from the future would have more then vague hints and a headache. Or was that from fighting the troll. CH1-3 Beta-ed.
