While I mostly read HP fan fiction, I occasionally branch out and read works from other fandoms, and what I find (and often seek out) is tons of whump!fics. And yet, somehow, in all my years reading Harry Potter fan fiction, I've never really encountered the equivalent. And honestly, I've never really missed it.

What does everyone think of whump? Why might it not be as popular in the hp fandom?

Edited to add: Whump is basically when a character gets hurt a lot, and usually there are looks into other people's reactions to it. It's a term that's used excessively in pretty much every single other fandom I've ever seen, so I didn't realize it might be unfamiliar to people in this fandom (although considering the topic of discussion, that should have been obvious).

*** Whump is basically when a character gets hurt a lot, and usually there are looks into other people's reactions to it. It's kind of hard to explain.

Whumpage is the act of the character being hurt (e.g. this fic contains excessive whumpage). There's Xwhump where X is the character getting hurt. Sometimes it's accidents, or getting tortured by an enemy, or getting seriously ill.

It might be an older term that's not used as often any more, but I might be thinking that simply because in the past couple years I've read primarily HP fan fiction, where the term isn't really used at all.

** I only ever heard the term used in the Stargate SG1 fandom around the turn of the century and not anywhere else, so I'm a bit surprised about you bringing it up here or that it still exists today, for that matter.

That said, there are a number of darker HP stories that would fit the theme, but the fandom never went so far as to get organized about the topic. In my opinion that's a good thing, because Stargate was a military-themed scifi show, while HP is a children's or young-adult series with a very different target audience both in their original and the fandoms.

** HP is about a bunch of teenagers trying to live their lives under growing oppression, whereas most whump!fics are about adults (usually with a support system) being ground down by circumstances until the bare bones of who they are is showing.

If Ginny Weasley had been ten years older, her situation in COS would have been prime whumpage material. However, she's 11, so her recovery from being mind controlled into a serial killer is just horrifying because she's a child.

** I...have never heard this term before. Does what happens to Snape in linkffn(Larceny, Lechery, and Luna Lovegood) count:

#+begin_quote
  "Well," Snape said to himself. "At least things can't get any worse." As if fate had been challenged to prove him wrong, the oily man felt a what seemed to be a tentacle caress his shoulder. "Oh bugger... no... no wait, that wasn't an invitation... NOOOOOOOOOO."
#+end_quote

Just one of many "comical" things that happen to Snape in that fic, many, many times. The fic overall is pretty good, but the Snape torture is it's worst aspect by far. It's not funny, clever, or well-written.

*** I found some parts of the story amusing [[/spoiler][like the Dark Lord Ron, him being the one who gets a harem for a change, and Harry and Hermione deciding to take up a life of crime]], but the whole "rape is hilarious!" thing is just gross. The story line with [[/spoiler][Dean being repeatedly assaulted]] fell into this category for me too.

*** Not really, I don't think (although probably this is all very subjective). That was intended to be a humorous torture of a character who was intended to be disliked, while I think all the whump I've seen has been hurting a beloved character.

Like reactions to his abuse at the Dursleys, losing Sirius + Dobby + Hedwig + all those other people. In fact, a lot of that is in the books as well.
