I want to read a story where Harry truly moves on, even if the girl is begging him for a second chance or whatever. Maybe she cheats or something, I dunno.

I'm in a particularly vindictive mood.

** Fanfiction doesn't really do "nuanced" relationships. I think the vast majority I've seen have no relationships, stick to canon, or pair Harry up with a soulmate without any other dating experience (and a couple where he dates someone else, but they leave because of his fame or something outside of his control)

*** The biggest problem in literature is that setting up relationships takes up time/pages. You get the reader rooting for the relationship and then have them break up. Since most people don't jump from one relationship straight into the next, you need some time to pass before building up the next relationship, beginning with attraction and the first tentative steps. Then you need to develop it into something meaningful...

Oh right, there was this thing called main plot. Unless you are writing an epic set over several years, multiple relationships aren't really within the scope of most fanfics since there is more going on than just who will bang (unless your whole story is just a romance).

** The only one I can remember and its really bad (that part in specific, I rather liked this fic, except for "I do not forgive, I do not forget" meme) is linkffn(A Cadmean Victory) [[/spoiler][where Harry and Katie are supposed to be going out and Katie just fucks up by saying yes to the Yule Ball to some dude. They breakup and Harry moves on to Fleur, eventually...]] It takes some time and it isn't a good romance by any stretch of the imagination, but it is serviceable.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
