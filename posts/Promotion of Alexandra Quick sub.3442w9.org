Just a quick notice to the community (pun intended). If you want to discuss Alexandra Quick stuff, please come over to [[/r/alexandraquick]]; it needs some love, badly.


** Wouldn't it make more sense to have those discussions here? This is already a small sub and that one has two posts after 9 mo... I get that [[/r/HPMOR]] is successful and gets a good amount of posts, but [[/r/alexandraquick]] will likely never get off the ground.

Maybe think about leading some discussions here. Better visibility and more subscrubers.

*** I just figured that it'd provide a venue to be more focussed on AQ as a series, and not in relation to HP fic, even though it is technically an HP fic. It essentially functions as a standalone series, and it has enough content and plot in it that discussions could function independently of other stuff.

******** Can you elaborate please if you don't mind? I'm very curious why you think that, and maybe eye-opening.

********* Pretty much the sole purpose of the fic is to advocate his transhumanist organisation and to expound on his views. When fanfiction becomes something /other/ than fiction written by fans who love the universe that the author created, and want to build on or improve that world, it conflicts with what I believe fanfiction is really about.

********** Wow, I didn't realize that. How did you know he/she is part of a transhumanist organization? Was there some scandal or something about it previously?

************ ok wow, I am trippin. All this time I Thought you were talking about the Inverarity person who wrote the AQ series, not the HPMOR series! ACK. Thanks for putting up with my ignorance! I tried HPMOR and found it to be esoteric, verbose and not particularly engaging, so hating him is moot for me
