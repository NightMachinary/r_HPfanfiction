I'm in a mood for a bit of House System bashing, including a character refusing to accept awarded points.

It can be "I really don't like the rat race it imposes", it may be "those F****** bastards betrayed me and like he** I will let them benefit from my hard work!".

Any fics where a student or group of students doesn't care, or wants to actively avoid earning House Points.

Other works, where the House System is mocked in other ways, are welcome too.


** I'm pretty sure that's somewhere in [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][The Secret Language of Plants]] series. Draco tries to lead a student revolution and convince all the students that the points system is just a tool of oppression.

** I'm glad that in cannon it doesn't get that much attention.

Like in the first few year for 11, 12 and 13 year olds they might care. But can you really see anyone older actually caring about the points when there is no actual reward for it.

I've been reading 'Fate' recently and the amount some.of the older kids actually care about house points bothers me just because of how little teenagers would care about it in real life.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  Harry Potter discovers the Player Handbook for Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, 2nd Edition after experiencing accidental magic and realizes he may have magic. Directed to a hobby shop, he develops his own style of magic based on tabletop RPGs and comics. Then, he gets his Hogwarts letter. Dark!Indie!Sarcastic!Paranoid!Pragmatic!Harry. Rated M for language and graphic violence.
