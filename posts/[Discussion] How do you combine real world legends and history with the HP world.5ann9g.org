How do you think wizards and other magical races fit into real world history? What's your personal/favourite interpretation of Merlin, King Arthur and other folklore characters? What are your favourite fics that explore this?


** For the Camelot idea in Potterverse, Arthur as he exist in the legends never existed, he is a amalgam of several rulers all folded into one. Merlin was the man behind the royals at the time leading the then magical community, and while some if not most of the Arthurian legends actually happend it wasn't to the same man/men but rather their bloodlines over a 100 year period (people forget that us Humans used to only live like 50 years back then) not including assassinations and stuff.

Gawain who joined the Round table isn't the Gawain who had a run in with the Holy Grail. The Lancelot who fought Galahad isn't the Lancelot who slept with Guinevere.

*** For Merlin, turn him into two people; an 8th century wandering Welsh hermit and mystic (Myrrdin Wyllt) and an 11th century Dumbledore-esque warlock who helped found a breakaway magical kingdom during the Anarchy of King Stephen and Empress Matilda. The Anarchy is a really good time to insert Camelot and King Arthur, just because it was so chaotic and because it fits with the fully medieval style of people's perceptions of the round table.

**** There's also Emrys (or Ambrosius if you want the Latinised name) the Romano-Brittish Seer and warlord. Though he doesn't actually have Merlin in his name...

I'm angling for a muggle-raised half-blood Merlin (for his 'demonic' ancestry) in the 1070-80s or so with the Marcher Lords. Similar level of disruption as the Anarchy but in Wales and it gives it a bit of time for things to get mixed up before Geoffrey writes it all down. The Anarchy is also a great choice though.

** I wrote a story where the Black Death and the Great Fire of London were caused by wizards. And the Loch Ness Monster is a basilisk. It's great fun. You can do anything you like.

*** I like to think that the Bubonic Plague was Dementor population boom, or at least aided by it.

** Personally, I quite like the idea of mixing the Ancient epics (E.g. Illiad, Odyssey, Aeneid, Gilgamesh, Etc) with HP. Never seen it done but it would make sense in a way. Admittedly though, I think that the universe fits between into post western roman empire history.
