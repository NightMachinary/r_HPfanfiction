It doesn't have to be 100% dark all the time, I'd actually rather there be recovery, or slow building of trusts or more relaxing moments the like, in between, to kind of help with the dark stuff, but I'm interested in reading darker stories.

Can be on any site, anyone can be the main character, can be old or new, can be completed or not. Can be any pairing (doesn't have to focus on a pairing), or the pairing can be minor.

Would love more darker/intense Lord Voldemort, darker/intense Death Eaters.

Not necessarily looking for Dark Harry, as those tend to be unbelievable to me, but if you have any really good and somewhat believable dark or grey Harry, I'll take them.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash, threesomes and the like.


** I am also looming for darker themed fics. My favorites are Rise of wizards and cademen victory. looking for a more real fics that a abused child doesnt cope well with the world and isnt fun and loving right out the get go from living under the stairs

** Linkffn(Brutal Harry) has a realistic Harry and does well in dealing with how a person, especially a kid, doesn't just come out of a home like the Dursley's okay. Pretty dark also, but hopeful.

Linkffn(Growing and Standing) touches on dark subjects like bullying and is so well written and touching that I cried, like, the entire fic.

Linkffn(Lady of the Lake) is darker, but it's a famine one that takes place after the series and is an ewe. It's ppe (politics, philosophy, and economics) a bit, and a lot of this author's fics go dark if you like this one.

Linkffn(Devil, Tower, Star) is /super/ dark in a not violent, mostly depicts the realities of war, and features scary magic. It's unfinished, but /so/ good and rather scary at times.

I've got a few others if those fit your tastes! Though if you're hoping for solely bleak only the last probably fits bc I can't stand no emotional payoff in a narrative. Too much cynicism is boring!

  Hermione would do almost anything to win the war against Voldemort, but after reading a book confiscated from the Malfoy estate, she begins to see that there is a price to pay for the magical and brutal help that she receives. Draco Malfoy, proper heir to the terrible magic and badly broken by war himself, is the only one who seems to have any idea of what is haunting her.

  In the Darkest of all possible futures a twist of fate meant to save him led Cedric Diggory to choose an entirely different path.Or: The story of how Cedric Diggory became a Death Eater. This fic was born of my catching a throwaway line in the Cursed Child about Cedric Diggory becoming a Death Eater. We see a lot about political radicalisation these days and I wanted to have a good delve into why someone (especially someone like Cedric) could end up wanting to join an organisation like that

** Their Verdict of Vagaries on FFN is slash Tom Riddle/HP, where Harry makes the wrong choice at the transit station of death and becomes misplaced in time, going down a moral slippery slope as a result of his isolation and trauma suffered at the final battle. It's very long and gets progressively darker as it spans the time from 1945 to 1981, basically observing TR's entire rise and fall from power in close range. In that sense it is quite unique.
