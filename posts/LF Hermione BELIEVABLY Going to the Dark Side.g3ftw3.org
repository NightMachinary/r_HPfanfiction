I would love to see a well written and believable fanfiction of Hermione changing sides. I know it's hard to write, since canon Hermione wouldn't.

I've read lots of different Dark!Hermione stories, but a lot of them are rather quick to flip Hermione over to the dark, and it's not natural, nor very believable.

I'd love to read something where it starts off exactly how it would in canon, with the same level of love and friendship between the Golden Trio. Hermione is still loyal, and she doesn't already hate the Order or anything.

A lot of these fics really change Harry's character into someone who isn't really Hermione's friend because he wants to be, or he's really annoying and ignorant of Hermione's problems, and Hermione is already disillusioned.

I'd love to see a story written where perhaps they (Hermione and Harry etc) drift apart as Hermione spends more time over on the dark side, or maybe something happens that makes her question what side she should be on. Maybe she suddenly becomes a pureblood, maybe she's very powerful so the death eaters don't mind she's Muggleborn, or maybe the Death Eaters are written in a way that makes them less horrible than their canon counterparts.

I'd just love to see a good gradual transition of Hermione changing sides, going dark, or maybe not going dark and the order is secretly purposefully keeping her out of things and she's fed up with it.

I know canon Hermione would never abandon Harry, but I'd love to see something that's written as realistically as possible. Harry could even become disillusioned with Dumbledore and change sides too. Maybe Hermione somehow gets drawn to the dark arts and then gets seduced/lured to the dark side. The author can even mess with canon and make the Order secretly evil and do whatever they want, as long as the relationships Hermione have start as they were in canon, and it's a written in a believable way.

Does anyone know of any fanfictions where Hermione changes sides for a good reason, or is written in a believable way? I'm really sorry if this doesn't make sense, I'm a bit out of it today and I'll come back later and try to make it make more sense lmao

I'd love a long fic if possible, obviously for this to work, the writing has to be really good as well.

Thanks! :)


** Well, linkffn(Hermione Granger, Demonologist) is a somewhat different take on "the dark side", but is a fun read.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.

** TL;DR Are you talking about Hermione going into dark magic and stuff or are you talking about Hermione joining Voldemort? Because one is believable if well-made and the other will forever be impossible unless you ask for an AU. In either case, I don't have a dark!Hermione suggestion /per se/, as this trope is almost never well-written, but I did strike gold with an OC-centric story where the OC is a girl similar but different to Hermione and actually replaces her in the world. She gets sorted into Slytherin because of her natural ambition and ruthlessness and her predisposition to violence as well as her status as Muggle-born helps/forces her to search more and more about magic in general but also to defend herself. By first-year she uses magic in a creative way to help her, by second-year she delves into Runes and Alchemy and in third-year she truly delves in dark magic with the help of the Diary and makes herself an army of disillusioned Inferi spy rats. The story is linkffn(The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House) if you're interested, it's a good read and also does a good job on explaining and expanding the magic system and world-building.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

*** Ooh! Sounds awesome! I'm sorry for such a long post lol! Either is fine! But joining Voldemort would be very interesting even though it's basically impossible to write. Even so, I'd still love to see someone's attempt, and that was the main question of my post. :)
