** I get the impression this community has a higher percentage of straight male members than the fanfiction community at large, so it makes sense that it would be less into slash.

I love slash personally (Remus/Sirius is my all-time favorite OTP) but I don't read that much in the HP fandom anymore (MCU is my current most active fandom) and a lot of my old favorites have disappeared as LJs were deleted, which makes it hard to contribute recs as often as I might like.

I do second the rec for AO3 if you like slash, though. It has a higher percentage of slash and also a slightly older average user base than FFN.net, which means the quality of writing tends to be a bit more consistent (though this isn't universally true by any means) and you get more sex scenes written by people who have actually had sex at least once in their lives. Pick a pairing and sort by kudos or bookmarks to get an idea what the most popular fics are.

** To be frank, I don't like slash because I'm not gay; therefore, I don't search out fics with gay pairings among the main characters. Intellectually I don't think there's anything wrong with homosexuality, but I do find physically intimate scenes between two males somewhat "icky". Sorry. That and I don't like Snape or Malfoy, which seems to make up a vast majority of H/male fics. I have read fics with slash as a side pairing involving, for instance, Sirius/Remus, without any issue. I just skip past the sex scenes.

As far as femslash goes, I don't find it distasteful in the same way I see [male]slash, but I rarely read anything not Harry Centric, so you see how this might pose a problem. I have from time to time read fem!Harry/female, but they are rare and I haven't found many high quality ones. Any recommendations of fem!Harry/female would be welcome.

** I suspect the truest answer is the simplest - most people do not identify as gay, and of that majority a considerable number are probably uncomfortable reading stories which require identifying with a homosexual character, even if it's just subconsciously. This is not necessarily because they are secret bigots (although that can certainly be the case). As much as it pains me to say it, I certainly suffer from this as well.

There's also the (not entirely deserved) idea in certain circles that slash tends to be bad fanfiction. It's not necessarily true, but there is a lot of bad slash out there.

A big reason why I struggle to read slash, to put it simply, is because I primarily read stories about Harry, and I just don't see Harry as gay - his sexuality is not a fundamental part of his personality, sure, but all the same it would take /great/ writing to lead canon Harry to a situation where I'd believe he'd fall in love with another male, and great writing is rare in fanfiction (let's be honest). I also cannot accept Harry being romantically involved with Snape, or Malfoy, or Voldemort, the three most popular pairings as far as I can see. The idea of him ever loving them is from my perspective so plainly ridiculous that I just can't bring myself to ever read any story that has the premise of promised romance between those characters. Snape is a comically ugly, brutish bully, although Harry obviously learns to look past his flaws eventually to focus on his heroic traits. Malfoy is a self-serving coward - how could Harry Potter, of all people, who values courage and selflessness above all else, find anything to love in him? And obviously Voldemort, y'know, killed his parents. To make romance work between those characters, you have to change the personality of those characters to such a degree that they stop being those iconic figures in the first place, and suddenly you're reading about totally different people with familiar names. (Although this is, in part, a general problem about how limiting fanfiction can be for ambitious writers.)

I will read slash when it's recommended and well-written between other characters, or when it's centered around Dumbledore (for obvious reasons) because I can believe in it if it's well-written enough, but I don't like slash when it concerns Harry himself.

** Straight dudes don't want to read about dudes screwing dudes. It's as simple as that.

I'm fairly sure slash is more popular than het, so you should be able to find lots of fics at FFN and AO3. Quality is another matter entirely, but all fics, slash and het, run into that problem.

Most complaints I see arising about slash is the lack of search filter options, not about its existence.

** As a straight male I have no particular dislike for slash, but i do tend to dislike slash(and femslash) stories primarily because the relationship tends to be the key part of the plot, and stories where romance is the main points dont really interest me at all. That being said, I dont like stories where there is a male/female relationship which is the main point of the story.

It also seems to me that when an author writes a slash story they tend to make the relationship the main part of the plot more then non-slash stories for some reason.

** Hm. I'm gay myself, but don't often read slash. It's often poorly written and doesn't really capture what it means to be gay (which, granted, is super subjective). The characters' psychology rarely feels right to me. Fanfic often has two extremes: 1) oh no I'm gay it's terrible and I don't know how to handle it until I see another man's cock and suddenly I'm well-adjusted or 2) being gay is fine and easy and life is a rom-com. I'm not expecting the next "Maurice" or "Fun Home," but the psychology never feels realistic.

Also, I've never read a fic that handled the sex well. I've found myself saying "that's not how it works! That's not how any of it works!" Like, being a bottom turns a male character into a feminized version of themselves. It's not about the relationship between two men anymore, just a wannabe heteroized version of it (I'm not sure I articulated that well, but I just spent twelve hours working on my thesis).

** Personally, I don't like slash because it radically changes the core of Harry's character. I think that a person's sexuality is an important part of who they /are/, what makes their core being. Harry likes flying, he has green eyes and messy hair, and around girls that he likes he gets nervous. That's who he is. Once you take any of those away from him, I just can't read it. It might be fanfiction and it might be AU, but once you change one of the main facets of Harry, you're just putting a self-insert/OC in place of him, and he becomes Harry-In-Name-Only. I don't like fics like that. It's why I dislike Santi's BWL fic.

Other people might call it homophobia, but it's just not. It's not offensive to me that they made Harry gay, it's just stupid and unrealistic. It's why I never read any fics with Dumbledore as a main character who has a romantic interest (usually McGonagall) before JKR's reveal about him, and why I would never read a hetero fic starring him now. I may not like how JKR revealed it (I find it cheap that she outed him in a post-book interview, rather than in-book) but since that, and his relationship with Grindelwald, makes up what I believe to be his core being, it's preposterous to suggest otherwise.

** To answer your question itself, it's hard to say the reason why people don't like slash (especially as I am not one of them). What everyone looks for in literature is different. This sub appears to have more male active members then female, and this influences the general feeling and postings. I can guess a few reasons why people dislike slash, many which boil down to simple homophobia and the cultural insistence that any exposure to homosexuality can somehow make men gay. Outside of knee jerk hate of any same sex relationship there is the /perception/ that;

- slash is poorly written in general (grammar, spelling, flow etc)
- slash is an excuse to feminizes male characters, making them out of character (and often poorly disguised self inserts by young female writers)
- slash has unrealistic sex
- slash is too emotional, angst-y, depressing
- slash is written by women for women, and therefore is not worthwhile/true literature (so not just homophobia but sexism)
- slash is just smut
- characters shouldn't change sexual orientation in fanfiction (this is seen as worse then any other canon deviation)
- there are people who see any pairing (hetro, homo or other) outside of their one true pair as a personal offense

Many of the reasons above also apply to femslash, but in general criticism of femslash is much less. This may be simply because there is less femslash, and homophobic reactions are never as strong against female/female relationships as male/male relationships. Harry Potter, as most popular fiction, also has many more interesting male characters then female characters, meaning the interest in femslash pairs will, by simple proportions, also be less.

*** Whoa whoa whoa - fair enough that you only said it's guessing a few reasons, but from what I've seen the HP community is one of the more open minded ones. I've not seen many people arguing about Dumbledore being gay, or hating on slash, even if they don't like it. I do agree with you though that reddit's demographics might be part of the reason for disinterest in slash here.

The fact is that Harry/Draco/Ron/Snape etc. aren't gay in canon - so when someone changes this in a piece of fanfiction, it is often the main focus. I'm a straight male who loves Harry Potter fanfic, reading stories where the core difference is that a character struggles to come to terms with his homosexuality is not interesting to me. I've already read books with that story.

There aren't many plot reasons to change a character's sexuality, and a lot of the time it is because the fic focused on a particular shipping and/or on the sexual relationship that entails. I'm not particularly into smut or fics focused on relationships, but if I'm going to read it, it would be something about my kinks.

I suppose the distinction I'd make are 'slash fics' and 'fics where characters are gay'. I've read good stories involving Harry/Draco, timetravel!Harry/Snape and Dumbledore/Grindelwald but they were stories with interesting changes to canon regardless of them being slash. If someone says 'slash fic' to me, I think that the main focus is on the slash relationship, which doesn't interest me enough to read it.

For what it's worth I think points 1-4 of your perceptions list are fairly reasonable assumptions for a fair proportion of slash fics. There's a lot of awful hetero fics too, but I never hear of them. I hear of terrible slash fics because some people promote seemingly any fics of their favourite shipping.

**** While it is true that 'slash' may refer to only explicit focused stories, it can also be used for any story in which the main pairing is male/male, and in this sub, I would argue that the second definition is what is generally meant.

HP fandom is rather open minded. This sub is... somewhat not. There is a very vocal subsection which will hate on slash at any opportunity (open any "hated/worst/grossest thing" thread and you will see what I mean). Requests for slash will receive fewer responses, and sometimes outright derision. While this comes from only a small amount of active posters, it /does/ give the impression of wide spread hate or at least intolerance. I am not saying everyone should love slash, but contrast the reactions to slash against harem. Both have their issues with poor writing, lack of plot, and impossible sex. Harem however, is not hated on as slash is here.

I don't understand how changing a characters sexual orientation is seen as so much worse then say their species (Vampire Harry, Werewolf Harry etc). Or moral alignment (Good Draco, Dark Harry, Bad Dumbledore etc) or the world history (Voldemort Wins etc). I would even argue that in the case of Harry, Snape and possibly Draco, there is no good argument that they are strict heterosexuals. Snape is shown as loving a single person, Draco may as well be asexual, and Harry's relationship is Cho is underwhelming, and the issues with Ginny are best left alone. JK did not write romance novels.

Not liking a sexual fantasy (I will not call it a 'kink' because that both implies that it is the only way people who read slash can be sexually aroused, and that slash is only about sexualised male/male interactions) does not give someone the right to claim (as has been only this week) that all slash should be banned. If they don't like it, don't read it. But they also don't have the right to hate everyone who does. And they certainly don't to take every single opportunity to be publicly disgusted by it.

***** Harem is (imo) some sort of sexual wish fulfillment, one that appeals more to hetero guys - the main audience of reddit. It's like some slash fics in that it panders to people who like those sex scenes. No surprise that M/(x)F is more popular to this community than M/M.

Less people like slash here, so it is inevitable that requests for it will get less responses. If a portion of the sub doesn't read it, they can't give suggestions on it.

No argument for being strict hetero doesn't really mean there's an argument for slash. A couple of imperfect relationships don't make you gay.

I don't think that changing a character's sexual orientation/species/moral alignment/anything is bad, it's a fanfic and authors can do what they like. But to make me want to read it, the changes should make interesting differences to the plot. The repercussions of Dumbledore being evil or Draco being good can make for interesting divergences. I haven't read vampire or werewolf Harry before, but Harry being a part of another magical race would massively change the plot. Harry being gay/bi/pan means either that he happens to have a different range of partners to choose from and otherwise doesn't change the plot, or the story is now focused around his sexuality and/or his relationship. It doesn't change his role in the war or how he's likely to face Voldemort, for example. The former seems like an almost unnecessary change to canon - stemming from self insert or shipping. I can understand both and if it has a good plot then I'd happily read it. The latter is honestly not something I, as a hetero male, want to read.

Reading through your post, I feel like I'm missing some specific posts because I haven't seen 'outright derision', '[a claim] that all slash should be banned' or '[people being] publicly disgusted by it'. In fairness I don't view every post here and haven't been active posting for a couple of months, so I probably have missed a fair bit. Perhaps I'm being naive, but I feel like those reactions aren't the norm on here. There are valid reasons for people to not seek out slash fics, and a minority of homophobes doesn't truly answer the question of this thread.

But I simply have no interest in reading about a homosexual Harry or Ron or Draco, etc. If those characters were changed to homosexual characters by the authors of the fanfics and their names were changed and I wasn't specifically looking for fanfiction based on canon, I would be interested in reading whatever. I love to read no matter what the characters sexuality orientation.

** I don't read slash for the same reason I don't read harem or threesome fics: it's just sexual gratification. Having said that, unlike with harems, I don't have any issue with people liking slash or asking for it.

** 1) It's usually badly written. /Very/ badly written.

2) I don't swing that way, but if it was well written, then perhaps. But see point 1.

3) Very often it involves Draco (in [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants][Leather Pants]]), or a Snape/Harry pairing. That is way too out-of-character for me to suspend disbelief.

4) It often contains graphic sex. Not by itself a bad thing, but it seems that the writer has never experienced this, and is merely writing out of his/her ass. Porn movies might inspire, but they never portray the problematic parts.

5) Quite a few of the stories introduce the concept of a dominant/submissive relationship. /Definitely/ not my cup of tea. I'd rather read about Harry as a Furry. And I'm not talking about being an animagus, I'm talking about /wearing a costume/.

Actually, that would be /hilarious/. Now I want to read about Harry wearing a furry costume. And humping Snape's leg.

** a lot of the ways people write harry as a straight man (who knows how to treat a lady properly) are so cringe worthy i need to read an anal sex scene between dobby and harry just to clean my mind. sometimes romance starts or ends well, but rarely both in the same story, and rarely either.

there are a lot of good slash stories on ao3 if you search for pairings specifically, otherwise you have to go through all the draco and snape stories, err.

** I don't like gay porn.

I don't read HP fanfiction for smut or romance. Romantic relationships don't interest me unless they are of the particular kind that I like (and that kind is rare in both fanfiction and literature).

I don't like OOC characters, which slash /always/ has.

In my experience, slash is usually written by women who completely lack understanding of how men act and think, and thus it has bad writing and characterization.

** I'm not a fan of romance fics, if there is a romance plot line I want it to be a C or a B storyline and slash tends to be romance heavy. Also a lot authors throw two characters together that I personally don't think would work well. Draco/Harry, Snape/anyone, Luna/Hermione.

** I like it :) well, femmeslash mostly, but I ship seamus and Dean. :) it can be hard to find good quality stuff that doesn't oversexualise/isn't too porny. I rely mostly on recommendations, so I don't get to see as much as I like.
