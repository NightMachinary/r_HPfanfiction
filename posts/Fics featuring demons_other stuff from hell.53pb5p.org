Looking for fics featuring demons or other stuff that comes from hell. No dementors, unless they have demonic qualities.


** This is a relatively common request, threads (in vague oldest to newest order): [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/33n6x5/lf_fics_with_lovecraftian_themes_or_elements/][lovecraftian]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3ab9v8/lf_fic_with_demons_hellhounds_etc/][demons & hellhounds etc]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3jgnxu/looking_for_superpowered_angeldemon_fics/][superpowered angel & demon]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4ab2lt/request_looking_for_fics_where_harry_makes_a/][Harry makes a demon deal]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4ff3al/stories_with_demonshellthe_devil/][demons and the devil]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4d5jye/request_evildemonvampire_femharry_fics/][evil demon feml!Harry]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4jrex6/looking_for_a_demon_fic/][specific demon fic]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4kjkut/any_vampire_or_demon_or_other_occult_monster/][demons and occult]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4tj7nx/request_paranormal_and_folklore/][paranormal]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4y214s/lf_stories_that_involve_demons_hopefully_some/][demons]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4xeoe5/lf_demon_fem_harry_fics/][demon fem!harry]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2452681/1/Evil-Be-Thou-My-Good][Evil Be Thou My Good]] would be my recommendation in all that. Its a good, complete fic, which actually has a little horror rather then just gore. Supernatural crossovers have a lot of demon deals, but they tend to be fluffy rather then horror. Example: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10916724/1/A-Deal-Made-in-Good-Faith][A Deal Made in Good Faith]], is despite it's 'horror' genre tag, more a mary-sue everyone loves her fic. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6180986/1/Creep][Creep]] is really just an excuse of rough slash sex. For non-supernatural crossovers, I haven't read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5501817/1/Something-Wicked-This-Way-Comes][Something Wicked This Way Comes]] but I have had it recommended to me before. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11309606/1/Broken-Angel][Broken Angel]] might fit (if you count the 9 tails as a demon), but again, it really isn't horror. There is some gore. If you count Hellsing as a demon, there is a number of fics there too. Cthulhu Mythos may also have some fics.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

  Remus Lupin vaguely knew what to expect when a being that called itself a god appeared before him. An offer for a paying job wasn't on that list. It wasn't like he was employed at the moment, and the job had good benefits. Too bad he had no idea what he was getting himself into. Pseudo-Lovecraftian AU, with Powerful!Remus. Mild Dumbledore bashing in early chapters.

  When Hermione looked through the attic of Number 12 Grimmauld Place, she did expect to find dark magic, forbidden rituals and terrible spells. But the darkness rarely tells its secrets, and so Hermione is caught in a whirlwind of black magics, with a demon inside her head and a Mistress hailing from the House of Black.

  (Female Harry! Evil Dumbledore!) Two teenagers, with shared circumstances. Both shaped by deluded old men into weapons against immortal monsters. But perhaps they are more alike than most thought.

** linkffn(A second chance at life by miranda flairgold)

I always hesitate to recommend this one as an HP fic.. because really, its a complete original story with amazing everything in it... where the main character happens to also sometimes go by the name Harry Potter... But demons are a real danger in this one, especially in its sequel.

linkffn(bungle in the jungle by jbern)

You will eventually get used to reading in 2nd person... the demon stuff is much later on after a great journey through cursebreaking with Bill Weasley.
