:END:
The only thing I remember about this fic is during the astronomy tower battle Harry and Dumbledore walk through the school together defeating all the death eaters with no help


** I swear I read this. I will attempt to look through my saves and find it!

Edit2: I apparently don't know how to use the bot lol so here's an excerpt from chapter 33 and the link:

"Those present in Hogwarts that day would remember a sight that would at once terrify them and fill them with hope for the rest of their lives. Striding down the halls like demi-gods, Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter cut a swath through the attacking Death Easters and their allies as a scythe through grain."
