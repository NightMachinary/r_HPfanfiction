Never been a fan of her. Want good fics where she is actively based or isn't very relevant or just plain non existent.

Examples include: 1. Passageways 2. Hp and the Sirens Song 3. For love of Magic 4. A fine spot of trouble 5. Cadmean Victory

The fic has to be good, it should have good plot and good grammar. I dont hate her enough to read stories full of spelling mistakes and bad phrasing.

Also no harry/other male pairing please. Not my cup of tea.

**** Thanks! Iv mentioned the first in my examples above, and I do know about the second, haven't read it yet because I'd need to read the first book which has her as a main character. I have read other fics by The Engulfing Silence, he is a good author.

  One year ends and another begins. During this year, Harry Potter studies under Nicolas Flamel, is forced to deal with a Vampire Princess, and learns there is yet another danger lurking within the walls of Hogwarts, one that's been around since the time of the Founders. What's a poor student with perfect memory to do? Sequel to Gift of Memories. Warning: Character Death!

"Hermione Granger and the Serpent's Renaissance", linkffn(10991501): Don't be misled by her name, she's not Hermione, but Salazar Slytherin in reality.

  They didn't question why Hermione Granger was able to cast every spell in the first class, or why she seemed to know Hogwarts: A History by heart. They never really noticed her resourcefulness, determination or cunning. A Gryffindor meant for Ravenclaw, they called her - and yet...

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.
