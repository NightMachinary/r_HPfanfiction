I was watching Pacific Rim and the Drift mechanic made me think about using it for mind healing and I may do a few thousand words on the idea but for now, I'd like to see more stories where Harry becomes a mediwizard.


** No! As everyone knows Harry is only allowed to be either an Auror or a Quidditch Star! Nothing else.

Just kidding... but the only story that comes to mind right now is this weird crossover fic:

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

** I can only really think of 3 right now. (I'd linkffn, but it's too much work)

Incorruptible: The Dementors Stigma - Zombie Apocalypse

Whispers In The Night - H/Multi 4th year. (H/DG/SB/TD/FD/NT to be exact)

And I think that 'The Lie I've Lived' might also have some healer Harry, though I've kindve forgotten in the 2 days since I read it.

  A year has passed since the dead started returning to life. The fate of those hoping to survive and rebuild rests on the best and the worst of humanity, both wizards and Muggles, with their political ideologies and the ravenous undead in between, and it's up to Healer Harry Potter to save as many as he can in the crossfire. A Harry Potter Zombie Apocalypse Fanfiction. HP/AG.

  Words have more power than we think. Thoughts & dreams can be revealed to those closest to us, to those we want to know more of, & to our greatest enemies. A single act of kindness, a single word can change someone's entire world. Join Harry on another adventure through his time at Hogwarts where even the quietest whispers can make a difference. Harry/Multi. Mature for a reason.
