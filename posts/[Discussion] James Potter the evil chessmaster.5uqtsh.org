This is the first time I have ever seen James Potter portrayed as the master manipulator.

*** Agreed especially since he could of easily established himself as a leader and led to a change in the status quo. Or even usurp control of the Progressive families to lead into change.

Also it's odd that his plans to empower the Wizarding World are contingent on getting lucky that Voldemort doesn't go Scorched Earth one day

  Dumbledore wasn't the only one with plots within plots running during the fight against Voldemort. Though young, another Gryffindor had his own plans for improving the world running, his own ideas how that would come to be, his own unwitting weapon to hone, and his own sacrifices to make for a Greater Good. (Oneshot).

** Totally irrelevant, but I just looked at the title with my early morning blurry eyes and thought it said: James Potter the evil cheesemaker.

Uh oh, plot bunny. Plus autocorrect tried to change cheesemaker to cheesecake.

James Potter the evil cheesecake. I like.

I think I may be getting a migraine.

** There is one big problem with this fic.

He quotes /The Phantom Menace/ during it, which comes out long after his death.
