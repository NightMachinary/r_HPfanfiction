tl;dr title.

What I want to say is, making Dumbledore into this powerful wizard, well loved by public, an important politician who swings opinions, that crosses boundaries between good and evil for the brighter future, that recognizes his mistakes in rise of Riddle and wants to prevent them from coming again and conquer his largest mistake (Riddle himself) by manipulating pieces on the board can create such an interesting story that it pains me everytime that I read Dumbledore being a senile lemon drop addict that sees everything indie!Harry does as becoming dark. In canon Dumbledore is a man who almost became Grindelwalds partner, who doesn't shy away from lethal spells, who fought in wars, and he can become so much more if only given a chance by writers.

I dunno, maybe I'll write this type of story someday, I already have some plot points in my head.

We'll see


** I'd love to see a story which does not present Harry finding out about Dumbledore's manipulation as a moment of triumph, but rather as a moment of absolute panic and fear.

Like can you imagine? Harry just finds out that this Wizarding powerhouse, a guy with 100 years of experience, a ruthless guy, has designs for him. Designs that aren't aligned with Harry's interests at all.

Harry should be terrified out of his mind and he should understand that this is a situation he can not come out on top in. No matter how many lordships he has.

I honestly don't even know how in the case of competent Dumbledore Harry can come out of this situation without his memory being wiped or worse.

Unless he turns for help to the only wizard Dumbledore ever feared...

** honestly what ruins most manipulator-dumbledore fanfics for me is this:

They say that he is this master-manipulator who has years of experience and nearly has the entire country in his grasp, with few exceptions and the exceptions are usually seen as undesired individuals who allied with Voldemort in the past.

And yet he is constantly fooled by some brat who just became interested in politics a week ago and took a starting-course in politics.

It is quite frankly idiotic how contradicting most authors are with their tropes. One minute the enemy is a master-planner and a serious threat, the next he is a bumbling fool who screams like a kid.

If they make Dumbledore a basic manipulate everything to the ‘light side' one dimensional guy, its on the author. Im sure there is another author that can write almost the same plotline with 8x better characterization and decision making.

These stories with boring Dumbledore's give him such basic non subtle manipulation, dialogue and nonsense decision making.

Loosely, the difference is that "greater good" is about maximising the overall balance between good and harm (as Dumbledore sees them); and "lesser evil" is minimising the overall harm, which still requires trade-offs because not all harms can be prevented, and reducing one harm may require increasing another. The latter is a much more passive and less effectual position than the former, but also less ethically risky.

In my fic the Elder Wand was used by a Dark Lord several hundred years ago in a horcrux ritual, to disastrous effects. (It isn't a horcrux, but it /is/ manipulative and evil.) I mean, it's not like Albus had a perfect perfect reccord in cannon with dealing with cursed items after all.

** Harry Potter and the Ring of the Ancients portrays him like that. His true allegiance is revealed in a plot twist at the end. I should not post spoilers but since the story is no longer online it doesn't matter all that much. HE is basically forced to reveal his true nature because of a fuck up on his minions' side and he is so extremely powerful that Harry manages to escape him with some very quick thinking on his feet without making him or Dumbledore seem too ooc.

** What I want to see is manipulative DD who is still mostly doing so for good reasons (leaving whether or not these are the right decisions to interpretation) but Harry understandably not wanting to go along with it, even if they are both on the same side of the good/evil divide.

** linkffn(Tales of Three)

Dumbledore is good but manipulative. I've received a ton of praise for how I wrote him. Sixth chapter is a 10,000 word long conversation with Dumbledore.

  Wrath burns deep within Iris Potter, and such things must be tempered, even if it's with Albus Dumbledore's idea of education and guidance. After a disastrous end to her second year, Iris and Dumbledore find themselves tangling with old enemies, time travel, and what's best left unexplored --- the eldritch. [Mentor!Dumbledore. Morally loose fem!Harry. Canon Divergence.]

** A truly manipulative Dumbledore would be terrifying and an incredibly hard feat to write.

I'm talking about decisions so subtle and apparently innocuous (even down to body-language and vocal inflections!) that it'd take years and teams of fans dissecting/evaluation his every move and action in the narrative to uncover it all, and even then they'd likely miss a lot.

Instead, we get him acting like he'd been hit in the head with a goat-shit covered shovel forty times.

** " who doesn't shy away from lethal spells" you say.... You point out that he almost became partners with Grindelwad, and that he would be the one to understand the boundaries between good and evil. But you forget to point out that he preaches "forgiveness". The only time we see him act in a fashion that could be considered lethal is when dealing with Riddle, who he know he cannot kill.

Personally I think he's blinded by his desire for redemption so much that he tries to redeem everyone and if they don't follow his 'path' then they are in the wrong. But having lived as long as he has and amassed the power he has, he doesn't need to use force to convince them. While it often is over the top, the idea of Dumbledore using his authority to say "You are going dark" is still viable in the sense that he would try to use his position of power to guide and influence rather than use pure force.
