*** Given the limited information Rowling provides, and most peoples' refusal to accept that Lily, totally apart from James related stuff, could have caused problems with Snape's emotional trajectory, its pretty hard not to assign Potter quite a bit of blame for Snape's life. Especially since making James use 4x the hexes as is likely is easier and more age appropriate than say, having a lot of "intense" scenes related to Snape's family life. Most people also lack any exposure to cults/radical political movements necessary to really show why Snape was sucked in to Voldermort's cause. Blaming Potter, especially as Lily eventually marries him, is just easier.

***** Of course, even if no one is even 1% responsible for their own actions in reality, it is valuable to society for us to treat them as if they were because our actions on them affect them. Although whether certain responses are better than others is a whole different issue.

In the case of Snape, given as I said our limited Word of God knowledge of Snape's life, its quite possible to identify several ways in which his life could have been fundamentally altered by even small changes outside his control. Some changes are more intense than others. For instance a happy childhood. Note that Rowling believes, and therefore this applies in canon as Word of God, that love from other people, which in the story as in life is often outside our control, is a powerful determinant of who is on what side in the story.

Another change point is of course the sorting of Lily and Snape. I'd imagine the above are 2 of the most obvious points of departure for Snape fan fic writers.

Others are still potentially obvious and powerful but a little less common I'd expect. Consider the random encounter which created the Snape/Marauder feud. Given the impact of James and Sirius on Lily's and Snape's relationship, this would probably have altered the course of Snape's life as well.

Also consider Snape meeting and making friends with a non-deatheater Slytherin, which we are told exists in canon. This would alter both Snape's potential path, weakening the allure of the deatheaters as well as alter Lily's perception of Slytherin and potentially affect her friend's opinions of Snape since they wouldn't be as likely to consider him totally evil and Lily obsessed. Since most of Lily's damaged opinion of Snape relates to his friends, who fuel his dark magic obsession which she also dislikes, this would possibly give her both the desire and the example to use in effectively demonstrating that he can be happy without being a deatheater.

You could also consider one of the teacher's either out of compassion or at Lily's behest, helping Snape either by hooking him up with potential friends or simply giving him the recognition he desires, and indeed deserves, for his accomplishments.

Snape often comes under fire for his hygiene and appearance. Any change here, from whatever direction it came, would allow him to both impress Lily, if you believe that Rowling was sincere and not just trying to please shippers when she said Snape had a chance, and/or her friends whether this positive impression meant romantic entanglements or simply a more secure friendship and potentially new friends.

There are plenty of other less critical but still potential points of change but I think I've mentioned enough to make the point.

Would Snape be a better or worse person if one of these things happened? Since he would have followed a James-like path of maturing, and James' later maturity is the generally defining factor in the James vs Snape fight that shippers like to have over and over ad nauseum, we have to conclude that he would have been a better person than canon Snape. And yet none of these examples provide any sort of decision by Snape to make good, they would simply be things that he passively accrued benefits from.

Do you hold Snape responsible for his Sorting, or his physical traits? The hatred of him held by James? Was he responsible for his childhood? What about the apathy of the teachers towards his suffering?

Responsibility is quite an interesting topic philosophically. And then there are the neurological influences like depression and other mental disorders.

We know that Peter, a supposed Gryffindor, betrayed Lily and James in the end. Why was he sorted to Gryffindor and not Snape? Was the hat not able to sense Snape's potential for bravery and loyalty and/or Peter's lack thereof?
