******* Not really, Manuel is a just character on Fawtly Towers. Manuel mainly consists out of misunderstandings and getting berated.

It's a classic in British comedy though. Can really recommend it.

** Within six hours of the first copy coming into Umbridge's possession, the following notice goes up.

*EDUCATIONAL DECREE #* </insert number here/> ^{Can't remember what the last one was, but I think it was somewhere around 25.}

*Any student found with a copy of the book* */1984/* *will be expelled*

Within twelve hours, every single student in the school has read the book. And all the teachers and staff too, except Filch.

** Just slightly related, I have to suggest linkao3(1143960), which contains rather gruesome description of the rule of Voldemort over England, and it is pretty close to the combination of “1984” with dementors freely attacking Muggles. Really great story!
