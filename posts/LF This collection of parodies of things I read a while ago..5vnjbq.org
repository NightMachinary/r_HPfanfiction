It had chapters making fun of a lot of fanfiction tropes in pairings, Dramione, Snarry, Greengrass ect. Harry is usually the straight man while everyone around him does stupid stuff.

I specifically remember this one part where Daphne is angsting a monologue about how she can't be seen helping a gryffindor because she's in Slytherin and Harry says something along the lines of "if this is the best help the Greengrasses can provide then why the fuck did my parents make a contract with them."


** Linkffn(Potter ever after) maybe?

  Between marriage contracts, soul bonds, angry fathers, wandering eyes, backstabbing women, and defiant house elves, Harry has a feeling that 'True Love' isn't in the cards for him in this story. Which is just fine by him, as it turns out. A depressing walkthrough of the current state of HP Fanfiction.
