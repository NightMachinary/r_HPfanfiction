I was wondering if there are any good fics that have a well written antagonist (i.e. not just evil for the sake of being evil) with other driving ideologies than blood purity. It seems like in every fic the antagonist is either Voldemort or some desperate Death Eaters (after the fall of Voldemort) or some future blood purist or some past blood purist. It can be any generation.

** The villain in this fic I wrote is pursuing personal power and immortality. She uses a group of pureblood supremacists as her muscle, but discards them pretty ruthlessly in the end. 100% canon-compliant, set ~ 50 years after the end of Voldemort's reign.

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...

** linkffn(Black Luminary) Heavy AU, written from the perspective of Harry who is part of the Black family which is regarded as The Bad Guys by society. The antagonists of the story are mostly the Light Side (so they are not blood-purity motivated) but they have just as many skeletons in the closet as the Dark Side. Who are also not motivated by blood purity but firstly survival and secondly upholding of tradition.

** I've read a few fics where the "Dark" side's primary motivation is to protect wizard kind from the disproportionately larger muggle population and/or provide a better solution than the increasingly porous Statute of Secrecy.

For example:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5925524/1/Twist-of-Fate][Twist of Fate]] - Grindelwald's war is a vast and elaborate smokescreen to cover up his main goal: to find an ancient Hebrew artifact that could enact a "Plagues of Egypt" style genocide on the muggles.

In fics where Dumbledore is the antagonist he sometimes has goals that are against blood purity. For example:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4025300/1/Reverse][Reverse]] - In this alternate universe Albus Dumbledore is a dictator over wizarding Britain. His regime persecutes "Old Bloods" (Pureblood families) while elevating Muggleborns. His justification is that the Old Bloods allegedly hold society back by rejecting the great progress that can be made by integrating magic with muggle technology.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12888734/1/Jonquils-and-Lightning][Jonquils and Lightning]] - In an alternate universe Dumbledore uses his political influence to completely eradicate all traces of powerful magic (including Dark magic) with the idea that the world will be a safer place without such tools in the hands of wizards.
