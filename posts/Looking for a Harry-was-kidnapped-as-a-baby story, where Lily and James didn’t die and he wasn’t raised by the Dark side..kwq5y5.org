Is there any good story where Lily and James didn't die, but thought Harry did? They suffered greatly after their son “died”, but with Sirius and Remus' help they managed to coup. Years later, they had some son or daughter and they found Harry, not raised by the Dark Side but shy, fragile and with an awful past. Now it's their turn to show them what love is and to take care of him. I know it's kinda specific, but is there any story like this that you can recommend?


** Here. It's not finished, but it ends at a fairly satisfying point I believe. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7624618/1/]]
