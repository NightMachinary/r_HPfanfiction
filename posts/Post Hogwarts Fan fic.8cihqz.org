Hello, im searching for a fan fiction post-hogwarts. It was one of the most favorited ones on fanfiction but i can't seem to find it anymore. I remember that the story was finished, and had two sequels(one of the sequels was about his family and sons, and not directly about him). In the story harry at first train to become an auror an succeds an became really op, he goes to live with ginny(who become a star quidditch player) first to the black mansion, and later to a mansion of their own. Later on the story harry becomes a teacher on hogwarts. He has a lot of trouble with post traumatic disorder along the story and the weasleys help a lot... Ohh besides he can be a dragon/serpent animagi i think. If someone knows where i can find about this story... I will be really grateful. Besides that sorry for any grammar mistake, english is not my main language.

***** it's a bit silly sometimes, but i quite like it. At least for me it's really easy to get into. But be warned, Harry becomes stupidly OP later on. If that's of your taste then go for it.
