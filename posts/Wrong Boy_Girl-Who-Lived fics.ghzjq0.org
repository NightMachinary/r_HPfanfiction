What's your favorite 'Wrong Boy/Girl-Who-Lived' fic?

Am I the only one who wonder just how and why the 'Wrong Boy/Girl-Who-Lived' genre is a 'thing'?


** I would imagine it came to be because of the prophecy. There were two candidates because of the specific wording and terms: they needed a child born on the end of July, but also with parents who thrice defied Voldemort.

Rather than create a whole new persona, they thought "what if Harry had a brother?" because that would still follow the requirements but also not add any unnecessary details or invoke any plotholes.

Obviously it would be twins because:

a)twins are quirky and unique

and

b)again, plotholes. It would be rather strange, though not necessarily, to have two children with the same/similar birthday. Rather than overcomplicate it, just make them twins.

Then, of course, after you've given Harry his very own twin (I feel like I'm at BuildABear), there's the question of: if they were both at Godrics Hollow, then how would they know which twin defeated Voldemort? Because people love Harry it would still be him, of course. But wouldn't it be so intresting and /tragic/ for Harry to be the Misunderstood Heroâ„¢? Of course theres the matter of the scar, but that's nothing a little /cough/ falling debris -/cough/ can't solve. Not to mention that this gives /great/ leeway for everyone's favorite hobby: Dumbledore bashing! And incompetent Dumbledore!

This is all just based on my own speculation / logic though, since I haven't been in the fanfiction community nearly long enough to know.

As for my own favourites? I have read some great ones, but before recently I never kept track of titles because apparently I'm clever like that. Of course I love linkffn(Saving Connor) (though I never quite finished reading the complete series) and the classic PoS, which is... Well,, if you know you know.

To tell you the truth WBWL fics are very much guilty pleasure of mine. I love myself a good old "Harry is the smart genius twin and his brother a spoilt brat and Harry secretly does all the work and the Potters abuse Harry" (imagine this but hyphenated - I really can't be bothered to hyphenate but it gives it more effect) fic. I enjoyed linkffn(Invisible by DebsTheSlytherinSnapeFan) which is, fair warning to you, Snarry. Now I have never read a Snarry fic nor do I particularly want to, but I suppose this was good enough, though I have to tell you I yeeted /straight/ out of there after the mpreg became too much.

Though of course no offense to anyone who genuinely likes Snarry or mpreg.

***** Well, WBWL can refer to Neville too, but it's unspecified. The basic formula is "Harry is the BWL but everyone thinks it's someone else," and that other person tends to be a twin sibling because A) it's easier to justify in-universe (both would obviously be in the house together, it would make more sense for Voldemort and/or Peter to mix them up, etc), B) it's an easy vehicle for Neglected!Slytherin!God!Harry and Marauder-bashing, and C) sibling drama. Technically, you can make anybody the WBWL and still be within the genre, but what would you rather do: set up a cracky scenario where Ron/Draco/CharacterIDon'tLike is the WBWL, try to follow canon by setting up a relatively ridiculous scenario where Neville is the WBWL, or simply invent a twin sibling and have everyone think the scar was a piece of falling rubble? It's just more convenient and creates interesting family dynamics.

  AU: Voldemort had no idea what she was starting when she attacked the Potters on Halloween night. Not only did she create a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she unknowingly touched the life of another just as deeply. Harry Potter grew up anonymous and alone, and when he reached Hogwarts, he was not quite what everyone would have expected. WBWL, Fem!Voldemort.

** This one is mine. I basically realized I like WBWL/WGWL tropes and decided to do one of my own.

WIP | fem-twins | Modern Day | James and Lily Bashing | Dumbles is just Dumbles | Voldy is still the bad guy | Tomarry eventually | 450K+ words | Character Growth | Universe Building

Basically, I split Harry into 2, giving one twin half his personality and the other twin the other half. One is kept and the other is given to Petunia. Now, it isn't until Ch. 15 that perceptions truly begin changing. If you read this, I ask that you tough it out and pay special attention to Prue's POVs. In this fic, I portray James and Lily as how I perceive them to be in canon, if they never actually matured at all and the war lasted 20 more years after they graduated.

On the surface, it seems as if the kept twin had a better life, and outside POVs from people who don't know her, paint her one way, when her own POVs paint her a bit differently.

Also, this AU focuses a considerable amount on the muggle side. Both twins got into their jobs very early and are more interested in their work than going to Hogwarts and learning magic. Fem-Harry is a figure skater and the other twin is a quidditch player. Both care more about their own business than anything else in life.

  Karma is real. It's a lesson that many have to learn the hard way. James and Lily Potter made the biggest mistake of their lives. The daughter they abandoned was more than they thought, and she becomes everything they wanted her twin to be. Belladonna Potter has her own plans for her future and no one will stand in her way. Hard work forever pays. A/N: Fem!Harry, Wrong-GWL, Tomarry.
