In canon, Voldemort is one of the most powerful wizards, second only to Dumbledore. However, compared to many fanon interpretations, the Dark Lord is severely lacking in creativity, competence, and feats of power. I can't help but agree with ~85% of the posts on [[/r/whowouldwin][r/whowouldwin]], which state that and explain why Canon!Voldemort would be curb-stomped by a lot of characters, from MCU Dr Strange (IW) to Harry Dresden and members of the White Council.

​

On the other hand, fanon interpretations of the character are much more powerful in their portrayals, as well as willing to use a far more diverse arsenal. Yes, Voldemort still suffers villain stupidity in a lot of fanfics and would still be curb-stomped by many characters from other universes, yet Fanon!Voldemort feels like someone who should be called "He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named". As a whole, HP magic has plenty of utility, though low spell speed and area impact; it's just that most wizards/witches aren't brilliant at it -- this is where fanon beats canon.

​

It has always been a major gripe, when crossover fanfics try to put Canon-ish!Voldemort on the same leagues as god-like characters. In reality, Canon!Voldemort just... isn't really that powerful, unless in a semi-realistic setting. What are your thoughts?


** Well you have a literary dilemma. If he's too powerful, he can't be defeated by Harry. Harry's unfortunately the Everyman. He might have wealth, luck, Love Magic, and a few friends on his side, but he doesn't really have much talent cannon wise to help him other than his bravery and empathy. That is his strength and his special power, but it does stretch believability. The horcrux hunt in itself has a lot of plot holes but I think it was supposed to follow the Hero's Journey and ancient myths like Jason and the Argonauts which is at odds with the magical realism and the casual humor of the first half of the series. I watched an op ed that said that the series is supposed to be a subversion if the fantasy trope of the Chosen One, and it is, but putting it in the context of a somewhat realistic war is kind of jarring.

** Voldemort's flaws lie in his arrogance and pride rather than his magical ability.

He has some significantly impressive magical feats-dueling Dumbledore to a standstill, unassisted flight, 7 Horcruxes, duelling three expert wizards, weird magical arm (which is impressive considering wizards don't really seem to have prosthetics of this versatility before).

On the other hand, I don't really see him matching up well against characters from other universes. HP magic is versatile but their bodies are human and are pretty breakable at the end of the day.

*** Actually, HP wizards have a fair bit more durability than their muggle cousins in canon. Quidditch is a good example, with the Irish seeker ploughing into the ground at 200 ks per hour and just getting a concussion out of the deal.

Also, remember that Voldemort's body is artificial by book 4 and, since we rarely get to see him fight, we don't have a solid idea of what he's capable of. The one time he faced off against Dumbledore in the books the two lit up the atrium like the bastard lovechild of a fireworks display and an artillery barrage. Yet, in the middle of all that, Voldie possesses Potter like it's nothing and then escapes the field despite who knows what protections activating to stop him.

I reckon that, if we had a better idea of his abilities, those vs matchup would look very different. Not 'curbstomps the God Emperor of Mankind like a bitch' different, but different nonetheless.

***** Fiendfyre+Urban environment = not-so-happy fun times.

Actually, I think that he would fit quite nicely into Worm. You have to admit that he would make a kickass gang leader in Brockton Bay or Chicago and he wouldn't really be quite as OP as he would be in other 'hero' universes.

Aside from that, if perils of the warp isn't a thing for him, the Warhammer Fantasy World. As a minor lord, he would have all the muggles he could ever want to mistreat, an endless army of badasses to fight against and Dark Lords to out-edge.

The Avatar universe is a bit hit-and-miss though. I mean, humans, he'd be great against. Spirits and such would be way trickier for him.

Hey, Tom Riddle masquerading as The Avatar sounds like a great premise for a trolling fic.

Every non-HP YA ever would see him win. Well, maybe not PJO, but that's only because Gods tend to get pissy when complete randos show up to insta-murder their kids.

Dresden and Supernatural are a No. With people actively looking to murder people like him and the forces of heaven & hell becoming interested in owning/killing him, I doubt that he would last long.

Another Universe he could handily fit into? Early versions of D&D, which inspired such classics as Berserk, fantasy fuckin' Vietnam and Goblin Slayer, to name a few. Again, plenty of non-magical assholes to kill/enthrall/etc, lots of enemies and more than a few casual scrubs that dare to call themselves Dark Lords. Likelihood of permadeath is high there, because phylacteries are a thing.

But the big scifi ones such as Star Trek, Star Wars, Halo, Mass Effect, BSG and WH40k are on the nope list as far as Voldemort's concerned. Too big, too much clarktech, so very many opportunities for a higher being/giant space octopus/precursor of humanity to come along and just paste his soul across n dimensions.

The Culture series and Stargate are exceptions. I could see him doing very well in those.

Voldemort's new horcrux being a GSV's controlling Mind would be awesome and scary.

***** I think a problem in assessing HP-magic strength is that we never hear about the real limits. Most notably if there is some form of "mana" or magical energy that gets exhausted. So if there is a difference between using "wingardium leviosa" on a feather, on a car, or a comet. Similarly the difference between summoning a small flame or a fire inferno. The books are mostly silent on /what it takes/ to cast a spell.

**** But before Mab gets there he has probably already killed Harry D after figuring out his invocation, everything Dresden does isn't out of the realm of The abilities for Potter Mages and in fact some feats have been outdone by lesser Mages in Hogwarts. The additional fact that Dresden uses multiple foci to achieve the effects he does and Voldemort can do the same with just his wand plus has the broken reality warping spells of Potterdom its a simple leap in logic that Voldemort could kill Dresden, and if he can kill the Main Character he is at least above most characters we know Dresden can defeat.

Mab being a interdimentiomal being who we know and accept to be a fairy being able to kill Voldemort doesn't change that Voldemort can probably kill most human Mages on earth, it's like saying that Since Voldemort can't kill a Outer God that he can't take over the human world of The Cthulhu mythos

I agree with you completely that against most wizards in the HD world, Voldemort would win no doubt. The rules of HP magic are simply more open ended and spells happen much faster in general.

I was specifically talking about the big guys in the HD world. Mab, Titania, Thor, Freakin' Santa Claus, etc etc.

In terms of upper limits of power, there's really just no question that the HD world does it bigger.

And even if a shield charm could stop that (which I doubt), it prevents the caster from using magic offensively.

So you need two or three machine guns to suppress the opposition and then pick them off with regular magic while they are taking cover. Throw in a mortar or two and RPGs (everything easily available in Eastern Europe/Russia), and you have a situation where magic might stop muggle weapons, but at the same time the weapons pin the enemy down (and ammo isn't an issue with transfiguration).

** He apparently is very powerful and is proficient in magical research and feats no other can.

For example he is capable of unaided flight, something which is considered impossible by conventional magical knowledge. Not even Dumbledore was able to do that.

He also performed the single most powerful feat of magic in the HP-Universe, which is the curse on the DADA position. It's literally a spell that somehow warps fate to achieve a certain outcome. Dumbledore couldn't solve that for decades, even with the help of people proficient in the dark arts like Snape. (There's of course the question of the limits of that curse, and why he can't just make a similar "Let me win"-curse so that he can sit back and watch his enemies fail.)

He is also a legilimens so can see his what his opponent is about to do.

However, he is still severely lacking because, as [[/u/Redhotlipstik]] points out, regular guy Harry must be able to defeat him. It's similar to the problem that somehow a group of students can hold their ground against battle-hardened death-eaters. Also, I'd say that Rowling lacks the, let's call it "criminal creativity" of a villain. She doesn't have them (or the good guys) plot out realistic plans.

Edit: An important question for the "who would win" scenarios would be the potency of the killing curse. Many superpowered beings (for example in MCU) can take severe punishment, be it lightning, physical impact, magic, whatnot. If the killing curse would insta-kill a being like Thanos, that would increase Riddle's standing in the lists by a lot.

**** Tbh, the taboo seems to be established magic. My understanding was that this was regular Ministry magic that he could employ after taking over. Partly also because Riddle isn't personally alerted but groups of snatchers who basically work independantly.

And yes, it weakens protective spells. When the trio was attacked by snatchers, all their spells to camouflage them were removed.

*** I'd like to imagine that it's because his horcruxs are being destroyed. Like he's already insane because they are separate from his body, but he can still draw power from them when he needs too. So as his mind/soul is being torn to shreds and destroyed, his magic is following it into death.

Alternatively I like the idea that his rebirth sapped a lot of his magical ability. Either because it was a magic heavy spell that needed long to constantly fed magic to maintain it's self, or because it had been so long since he last used magic that he wasn't at the same caliber as he was before

** He got what I refer to as the HP nerf, where he gets nerfed down to HP's levels, in Book 7. That's literally the only way he could lose.

In Book 5, a glimmer of his power is shown, when he casually waltzes into the Ministry, duels Dumbledore to a standstill (AD has nearly a century of experience on TR, so under normal circumstances, the odds would be heavily stacked against TR, even in spite of the artificial body and enhancements that TR has no doubt done), casually possesses HP, then casually rips through the wards and protections around the Ministry like wet paper when he and Bellatrix escape.

After all that, he falls to a fucking 2nd year spell. Yeah, Rowling definitely gave him the HP nerf.

In a more realistic setting, he would have allowed himself to be disarmed, then taken out his Yew wand, and cursed the shit out of everyone there.

Against characters from other series', well, as long as TR had his horcruxes, he was invulnerable. They might be able to surprise him once and kill him, maybe, but that would just turn him into a wraith. Can't kill a wraith, or trap one (as far as canon).

** I can't think of any fantasy setting that would struggle against Voldemort tbh. MCU is a bad example, because it's probably easier to think in terms of 'who wouldn't smash him'. His threat, doesn't really come from his strength though. It's not his magical prowess that made him feared.

He created a terrorist organization and turned the status quo over night.For years he killed and pillaged, and accumulated a very influential circle of supporters. It was his political might that created his legend. So I wouldn't say that canon Voldemort needed to be overpowered to work, he did the job Rowling intended him to do just fine.

*** Actually outside of Dr. Strange Voldemort probably kills all the Avengers, his magic disrupts the Iron Man Suit, plus he can transfigure it and Tony inside into a crushed ball of alloys and meat, Thor while super powerful is still mortal and this vulnerable to a AK, plus Voldemort has displayed more fluid and abusable magic than even Loki, Cap is a super human but still human, his best trick against Riddle is a shield throw but if Riddle snipes it with anything including Transfiguration, Charms, just blast it away from Rodgers. Rodgers falls to any spell Riddle can think of. Worst for Black widow since she is long lived but not a Super human, she basically falls like any well trained wizard against Voldemort. Vision IS tech so just trying to fight Riddle will destroy him, Scarlet Witch's Hex Bolts could beat him if she could hit Riddle but in the MCU she doesn't have the control over her abilities nor does she seem to actually have Chaos Magic of her comic counter part. Ant Man maybe again and he seems to have the best time against Riddle, but summoning spiders and then a wave of fire once He has revealed himself would do away with the micro hero. Hulk? Hulk's regenerative abilities don't protect him from a AK to his 11 foot tall face while he is screaming about puny mages

In fact if the Time Stone wasn't in the Eye of Agamotto the battle between Strange and Riddle would be much closer.

People forget that ALL Potter Mages have Reality Manipulation skills on a localized level, that is the inherent BASIS of their power. Add onto that the most talented and powerful mage in the entire series without the limitations of morals or fears and 70 years to turn that academic talent into combat skill. Voldemort lost to Harry because of Deus Ex Machina that doesn't make Him weak in fact it doesn't undercut but implies that without that power, Harry would of lost.

Extremely unlikely. I'd give Riddle a fair shot at a number of them, but not even close to all the Avengers. Just off your post -

Iron Man

#+begin_quote
  his magic disrupts the Iron Man Suit, plus he can transfigure it and Tony inside into a crushed ball of alloys and meat
#+end_quote

I'm pretty sure in canon it was magic and electricity that clashed and given that, there is almost zero chance that the suit isn't shielded against electrical interference given how easy IM would be taken down without a shielding.

Being turned into a crushed ball, extremely doubtful. IM is moving at Mach speeds, there is no indication that Riddle is reacting quickly enough.

Thor

#+begin_quote
  Thor while super powerful is still mortal and this vulnerable to a AK
#+end_quote

Unknown. You can assume that, but it can just as easily be assumed that AK could be shrugged off by an Asgardian because the fact is, there is not enough information about how AK works on non-humans.

Cap - agreed, but Caps 2nd best bet would probably his speed. He is that much faster than an average human being, and nothing indicates Riddle is working at superhuman speeds.

Widow - agreed, but she's more of an assassin so there's a pretty fair shot that she wouldn't go toe to toe against Riddle in a fair fight unless she absolutely had to.

Vision

#+begin_quote
  Vision IS tech so just trying to fight Riddle will destroy him
#+end_quote

No chance it is that easy. Again its almost guaranteed Vision is shielded from any type of electric disruption, otherwise any villain fires up EMP and Vision is down.

SW - she has way more control in Infinity Wars. At that point, she has a very good chance at taking down Riddle.

Ant-Man - Probably a wash.

Hulk

#+begin_quote
  Hulk's regenerative abilities don't protect him from a AK to his 11 foot tall face while he is screaming about puny mages
#+end_quote

Unknown. Similar problem with Thor. Hulk is no longer just a human, he is something beyond and there just isn't enough information about AK other than it being soul magic and OHKO to humans.

Strange - Portals OP honestly. Portals are fairly quick to achieve, and with Strange's intellect, I wouldn't doubt he would just portal whatever Riddle sends, right back at him.

#+begin_quote

Yea there is localized Reality Manipulation, but that doesn't change the fact that there is a system/rule in place for magic. It isn't whatever the wizards want to do, they can. MCUs biggest advantage over Potterverse is most likely speed. All the spell slinging in the world won't save them if they cannot hit.

Bear in mind though, this is speculation about a megalomaniacal narcissistic sociopath, so take it as a plausibility and not a certainty.

They limit it by the highest amount of energy it has shown to "tank" in the books. It can't take into account that the sheild charm may be immune to any non-magical attacks because that is considered a No Limits Fallacy. Different universes may have conflicting laws, so vs debates often has rules to take care of that, but as a result it can conflict with the rules of a setting. Thus, Voldemort's power really depends on how you interpret the Harry Potter magic system to work.

So Voldemort is, at least in my opinion the most powerful wizard alive. On the other side it is a bit hard to compare Voldemort to the characters from other universes, mostly because it is hard to hypothesize how HP magic works in contrast to other fantastic powers. For example the killing curse is an unstoppable one hit kill that, coupled with apparition, would give Voldemort an incredible advantage against any Jedi or Sith but if magic acts like a form of energy then it would be incredibly easy even for an average Jedi to defeat him considering that lightsabers can rebound energy hits and Jedi train to stop blaster bolts which travel way faster than spells.
