:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Feeling nostalgic and I can't find one of my favorite fics from back in the day (10+ years ago maybe? idk.) In the fic, Draco and Harry meet as kids. I think they eventually have a falling out (Draco moves away maybe?) but then they meet up again in their late teens. Snape studies plants and teaches harry all about their latin names. While this is all happening harry is struggling with the Dursley's abuse if I remember correctly. I'm afraid this fic might have disappeared with HPFandom's closing. Hopefully not though. I've tried searching ao3 but nada :(

Thank you!


** Linkffn(Draco's boy) This is it for sure :)

  No longer a repost. HPDM. Nonmagic AU. A mysterious little boy named Harry moves in next door to Draco Malfoy, and he's determined to make him his friend and learn all of his secrets. Years later, he's determined to make Harry more than a friend.
