#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time.

** I like the following multi fics:

*Broken Chains* and its sequel *The Stars Alone*, linkffn(7718942;12040341): typical Darth Marrs fics with lots of sex and violence, but I nevertheless enjoy them. I like the sequel actually better.

*The Accidental Bond*, linkffn(5604382): light hearted family/relationship fic.

--------------

My favorite non-canon pairing is Harry/Hermione/Ron, but there are very few of them:

AO3 has [[http://archiveofourown.org/collections/triofic/works][an archive]] of 96 Harry/Hermione/Ron fics. Unfortunately, they are either incomplete, one-shots, or just terrible fics.

*The Sum of Their Parts*, linkffn(11858167), is probably the best romantic Trio fic out there, but it never dived explicitly into romantic aspects of their relationships, merely stating [[/spoiler][they slept together.]]

*Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water*, linkffn(12076771), is the first fic I found that specifically paired Harry/Hermione/Ron together, is of novel length, and has a decent plot. However, It's also a crossover with Kantai fleet girls and requires a certain level of interest in WW2 naval history from readers.

*What it Comes Down to*, linkffn(6858689), is well written, but contains too much torture, angst, and is down right grim-dark. I only made it through a third before giving up.

*Ruthless*, linkffn(10493620), is high quality and has a great plot. However, Theo Nott replaced Ron and the story is relatively short.

  What happens during the year after the battle ends? Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Draco pick up the pieces left behind in the post-war Wizarding World-a world where they are adults and Voldemort is gone in body but not in spirit... This is *mostly* based off of book canon and what JK Rowling has said in interviews. Rated M for some lemon-y scenes.
