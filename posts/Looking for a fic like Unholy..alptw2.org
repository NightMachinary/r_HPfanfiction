  Blood is the one thing that binds us together as a race. Blood tells us who our family is. What one Harry James Potter finds out his blood can do more than THAT, well he decides to take the world by the horns swearing to take what was his and destroy all that stood in way. The blood is life challenge response for DZ2. Pairing undecided. Platonic! Sisterly!Luna to Harry
