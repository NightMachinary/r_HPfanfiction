#+TITLE: I’ve started a crossover fic that’s based on a character being sent to the Wizarding World but I’m not sure if it’s worth continuing anymore. Are you guys interested in reading it?

** I think the better question is *are you interested in writing it*?

If you are truly looking for feedback come join us on the [[/r/HPfanfiction]] discord (link on the sidebar), I'm sure there would be someone willing to give feedback or bounce around ideas. Writing is not something done in isolation.

*** Yup, I completely agree. You need to ask yourself if you enjoy it, the readers and everything else should be secondary. If you're passionate about what you're writing about, it shows, and people will eventually give it a shot. I also find people hesitant to start a story with only 2 chapters, so give it time.
