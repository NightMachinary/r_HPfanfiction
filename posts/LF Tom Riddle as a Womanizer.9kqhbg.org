It will be obviously AU, i think. So, i want to know if there are Fics that have Tom Riddle doesnt become a Dark Lord but instead a Wealthy and Famous (popular) Person and a Womanizer (well, maybe he wouldnt actively posing with his masculine capabilities, but if a Beautiful Woman would ask to share the Night with him, he wouldnt reject her). However, since he is such a Playboy, all Woman he already had, know that they arent the one and only and there are others, because few can resist such an attractive and charming Man (maybe with Bellatrix as his "Wife").

I can think about it as a Glamour Fiction, but since this would maybe be boriing, i would also be fine, if it has some dubious/criminal content (no violance against Woman, but illegal Business stuff). Also good would be if The Females of Toms School time and Harrys School time are roughly in an adequate age so Ginny would be one of his too.

Not necessary, but a Bisexual Tom would also be ok.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14527497/chapters/33565593][The Philosopher King]] might count. It's an AU fic in which Riddle takes over the world through charisma and power without becoming a monster. That covers the "Wealthy and Famous (popular) Person" requirement. As for him being a womanizer: in the fic he is eternally youthful and has had a long string of temporary "companions" (male and female) over the years. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14527497/chapters/33724599#workskin][Chapter three]] goes a bit more into it.

#+begin_quote
  Tom Riddle received a thorough education in magic, cultivated an influential following, and secured his immortality. He then disappeared into the Muggle world and was quickly convinced that, left unchecked, Muggles were certain to doom the entire planet. Tom returned a decade later with a careful strategy for world dominion. He succeeded. By the time a young Harry Potter, Heir to his Name and ward of the Malfoy family, is handed a wand at the traditional age of eight, he stands to inherit a modest territory of 25,000 square kilometers and eight thousand restless Muggle subjects.
