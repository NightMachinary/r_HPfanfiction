does anyone know a good fic, where hermione is muggle royalty, faces prejudiced purebreds and dates harry or is he his soul mate? I've been looking for it, but most of it is incomplete or comes out of character a lot. seriously if anyone knows any good, tell me, please!


** Not exactly royalty but very old noble family I can get from “Reboot by Kallanit” linkffn(9552519).

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. Some character bashing. No Cursed Child or Fantastic Beasts. COMPLETE.
