Title says it all, really. 170 C2 alert emails in my inbox.


** Fandom drama.

**** While its true that it is needless, if we are being honest it merely seems worse because it is so plainly stated on the internet (like reading internet text without emotional or context clues).

Things like this happen a lot in the real world too (have seen it both in my work and social life), but they are rarely ever broadcast publicly the way the internet does. It generally goes along the lines of:

1. Small tizzy between two or more parties
2. One party takes small measure to stymie other because of position of power
3. Slighted party gets angry, reacts to power play by trying to use leverage of their own
4. Retaliation places outside parties in line-of-fire as well, grievance becomes public
5. Results in one or both parties being neutered, but generally nothing systemic changes

Blunt, but it happens quite a bit.

**** Looks like he's not. Despite other members bringing up his behavior being problematic before. They "Don't want to turn it into an inquisition against Xiph". They being the other mods...

** Jep, the community used to be /The Greatest Author in the Fandom/ changed name to /Sorry4TheSpamBabes,luvNMBx/ and is now called /The PortkeyOrg C2/.\\
Got 170 new stories added...and I want to check them to see if they're for me or not. It's rather vexing.
