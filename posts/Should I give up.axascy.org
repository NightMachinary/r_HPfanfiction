This will probably sound very stupid, but I'm posting it anyway.

Recently, I've read a (sexual) fanfiction "Doulothymia, or, What If I Don't Want To Be Mistress?" and got way too attached to the actual plot rather than the sexual stuff, as I'm genuinely interested in how the story plays out and how it all end. But after I've read all the chapters, I've noticed that even though it's still WIP, it's last update was in 2014. I saw a couple of comments from 2019, which were basically talking about how he should finally release the next chapter, but there were no responses. I'm now stuck at this weird phase where it's all I think about, but there will probably never be an actual ending, which makes me feel really empty (like the feeling you get when a series comes to an end and you don't know what to do) and it made me think: Should I just give up on it?

If any of you have also experienced this, can you give me advice as to how get out of this phase?


** Admittedly, I've vanished from stories for years and then returned... bad form, I know. Has the author posted anything else? Otherwise there is only two options: try and throw yourself into another story or (my favourite) put your headphones on, go for a very long walk and make up your own ending in your mind

** I avoid fics that aren't actively being worked on or completed because of this. There've been a few too many fics that left me hanging in the past.
