Hey, I just started rereading an old fic I thought was decent, and I started to get irritated because the story is so very different then I remember, so I figured Ive been mixing the story with another one.

The story Im reading is the The Lie Ive Lived, very famous. The thing is I thought this was a story where Harry gets his Masters in Transfiguration by making a Niffler after the dragon task in his fourth year. Obviously its not, but now im looking for that story and I cant remember its name, im fairly sure its rather famous aswell though.

Things I remember for that story is as follows, He creates his own Pet Niffler with alot more defensive properties, it ends up being quite heavy because of that, also smarter if I recall. He makes real living cows with odd textures during the Dragon task. he takes his Transfiguration test with Minerva and Marshbanks I think her name is, by Hagrid's hut. I also think he transfigures a huge Elepant in the second task to move him and Hermione through a forest of some kind.

Thanks for the help.

Ps. I know nothing how Reddit works, and I cant figure out of to make this post with the right sort of tag "Looking for" so if a mod could help me out thatd be super.


** That seems like a mixture of The Lie I've lived (the Harry, Hermione and elephant/rhino in the forest) and something batcrap coocoo (niffler stuff). Sorry, that's all I've got.

*** Thanks! its not the one im looking for but looks like a fun read all the same.

Update: The cows he does during the dragon task have weird skin, I remember one of the cows skin is like a painting of the night with lots of stars and such.

** The niffler likes to sit on Harry's head and Hedwig's jealous?

**** I don't know yet. But I thought Runemaster involved a new greenhouse that Harry used for his workroom until he graduated and a Dark Lord-ending mega-scythe like from /BTVS/.

***** It is that for sure, that I remember very clearly, I just thought maybe he did the head sitting Niffler aswell? I know he tamed a dragon so not a big stretch for me, or maybe im completely wrong. If you do happen to find it however Id be super glad if you could drop a comment. Ill update here either way after Ive read Runemaster again.

  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.
