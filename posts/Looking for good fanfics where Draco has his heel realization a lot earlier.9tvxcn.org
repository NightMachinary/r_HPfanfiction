Say, at the end of fifth year. instead of during 1996-1997-1998 after having become a Death Eater himself, or even earlier.


** The Code series by Aduro on ffn. Can't look up the link just yet but if you Google it will come up.

**** So the entire series is written over the better part of 13+ years and the beginning of the story you definitely have to get past the Slytherin sex god-esque writing and then it does get better (although full warning, the ice prince and sex-god terms do get used throughout the first story). The beginning is actually my least favorite part of the story itself. I actually realized I'm about the same age as the author so she started writing this just out of high school. As you get through the other stories in the series you see her growth as an author and IMO she gets really good at it. Sidenote: try her story about Draco as an auror that is set during Christmas which was written much later and if you like that I'd give this another go and push through the beginning.

That being said though, it's absolutely not for everyone. It's my favorite series and I still roll my eyes at certain stuff at the beginning. Also it depends on your trope tolerance because the main character is literally a genius so there are a lot of scenes where he gets the better of someone. Those are some of my favorite parts though so to each their own. :)

**** I'm still hopeful! She went on unannounced hiatus during the third story but then came back after SIX years. It's been two years since the fourth story went on hiatus but I've got my fingers crossed she'll return.

*** Here are the links for those interested. linkffn(2750775) and also Discomfort and Joy which is by the same author which I mentioned in a comment below linkffn(5611653). I recommend this one as it has a young Draco (who abandoned Hogwarts around 6th year) and ends up joining the Aurors. He is partnered with Shacklebolt and is wonderfully snarky. When the Death Eaters take over the ministry they end up fleeing and have to spend some time with the Order.

â€‹

Basically, I'd recommend all stories by Aduro. They are really great if you are looking for a 'good but not so good' Draco fix.

  A War-Time Christmas Story in a New AU. Detective-Auror Draco Malfoy is forced to spend the holiday with a few Order Members at the Burrow after the Auror Department falls to Death Eaters. It's the time for miracles, so maybe they'll all get along...

** Linkffn(impose by marauderlover7) is the first book in a continuing series, where the major plot point is that Sirius black escapes from Azkaban 5 years early. As a secondary plot point though, Draco had an Irish twin, Hydrus. Draco goes to Gryffindor and is a good guy. Honestly, the Gryffindor!Draco part is my favorite; I've found most of the rest of it to be an unremarkable canon rehash.

  It was still called the "Noble and Most Ancient House of Black", though it had been years since any of the Blacks that approved of that name had lived there. Sirius Black would be a disappointment to his parents, but Harry Potter - the home's other resident - was a credit to his. Both were proud of that. Sequel to "Innocent", "Initiate" and "Identity".

**** Shared etymology. In wrestling, a heel is the designated villain; a heel realization is becoming aware that you are the baddy.
