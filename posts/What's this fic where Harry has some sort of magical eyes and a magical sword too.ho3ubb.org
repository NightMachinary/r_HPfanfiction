I remember reading a fic where Harry had magical eyes of some sort and a magical sword too (iirc the sword eventually fused with his eye or something). He eventually dueled with Nicolas Flamel who had some magic eye too. I think Hermione got hold of some evil book and became a dark lady along with Daphne (I think they trained a lot in by stopping time) and beat Dumbledore in a duel, who had some sort of power called first blaze. I think the main villains in the series is the fae, who Harry has a contract with. I also think it had a complicated magical system too.

Does anyone know which fic I'm talking about?

  What does it take to destroy something completely? Some would be fine with eradicating its soul. Others would argue that you must erase even the concept of the object from existence. AU, with a notoriously complex Magic system.

***** I think the quality was quite good (tho I may just be saying this due to nostalgia). I think the fic had a lot of subplots and then some stuff that makes sense only with context but I do remember it had a really complicated magical system that I ended up having no clue what was going one at some points as I didn't pay attention early on
