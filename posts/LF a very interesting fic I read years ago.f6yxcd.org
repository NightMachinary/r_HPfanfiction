:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
all I remember of it is that somehow, Harry and Voldemort end up exchanging letters, slowly becoming friends and it ends up with Voldemort being a teacher at Hogwarts or something. Can anyone help me find it? I should also point out that the one I'm looking for isn't a slash fic, as far as I remember

*** I'll read through a few chapters to confirm, but upon first glance, it doesn't seem to be.i should've stated in my original post that it wasn't a slash fic and more of a friendship one. Thanks anyway though
