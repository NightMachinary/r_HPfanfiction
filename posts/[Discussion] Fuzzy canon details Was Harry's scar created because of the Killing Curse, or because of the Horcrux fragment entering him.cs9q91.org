Not sure which of these two it is. I'm thinking about writing a fic that depends on the answer, though. But I suppose even if it isn't the right one for the fic I want to write, I can just do it anyway cuz fanfic...

I want to write an actual good version of those twin sibling, Wrong Kid Who Lived stories, but if it's the Killing Curse that made the scar, then it would end up giving BOTH kids a scar, but only one kid would have the actual Horcrux in them.

But if it's the Horcrux that's responsible for the scar, then only one of them would have a scar, even though both would've been protected by Lily and had the curse deflected.

OR I could just say Voldemort's unstable soul fragmented into TWO shards instead of one, and one went to each kid, so then they both get scars and Horcruxes together. That's totally believable.


** That's a false dichotomy. Neither, either or both, take your pick. The text doesn't make it clear so there is room for interpretation.

The scar is on his soul, and the physical manifestation of that is symbolic. This serves a purpose both in the story as well as being a plot device. Magic doesn't always make perfect sense. This is one of those times.

** It's from the Killing Curse. The text actually does make it pretty clear simply because everyone knows he survives the curse and that's why they look at his scar.

The Boy Who Lived in PS:

  "Is that where -- ?" whispered Professor McGonagall.

  "Yes," said Dumbledore. "He'll have that scar forever. "
#+end_quote

Diagon Alley in PS:

#+begin_quote
  "And that's where. . . "

  Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry's forehead with a long, white finger.

  "I'm sorry to say I sold the wand that did it," he said softly. "Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands. . . well, if I'd known what that wand was going out into the world to do. . . "

Edit:

OoTP

#+begin_quote
  'You are forgetting the next part of the prophecy, the final identifying feature of the boy who could vanquish Voldemort . . . Voldemort himself would mark him as his equal. And so he did, Harry. He chose you, not Neville. He gave you the scar that has proved both blessing and curse. '

** I would think it's caused by the Horcrux, because (as far as I know) he didn't get an other scar when he sacrificed himself. Or maybe, Lily used a rune for protection (sowilo) and the Horcrux went there.

** One would assume it was the killing curse(or more accurately the curse rebounding from lily's sacrifice) because the scar is the shape of a lightning bolt, the wand movement to cast the killing curse.
