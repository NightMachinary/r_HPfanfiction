For me it's dumb stuff, 12yo talking like a 70yo senator, bad obvious writing, such like that

Edit: Lunatic Luna. I love me a good luna and/or luna/Harry fic, but so often Luna is walking around like a madwoman spewing nonsense about nargles and such. Yes, it's her character, but authors turn the dial to 11. I know she is a difficult character to balance, but do or do not, there is no try. Many of the Larry/Huna fics goes something like this "Harry, I was talking to a nargle when a bubbering humdinger said I need you to put your penis inside me. Please do that now" /strips/.

Fucking hell...


** Wow literally so many times. I read a lot of hurt/comfort severitus type stories and stumbled upon like....a 15 chapter story wherein every.single.chapter Harry just.....pees on himself? Like the whole plot to the whole story is just Harry not making it to the bathroom and Snape cleaning it up.

On the first chapter I was like aww that's sad. Second chapter like...hmm interesting. Third chapter & I had that exact moment. Like ..I can't believe I was duped into reading this ðŸ˜‚

** One fanfic I have overall enjoyed, although it's cliches out the wazoo had one moment that just frustrated me to no end.

In /Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone/, Hermione, at the beginning of the year, has no friends. She is frequently showing off in class as well, and that puts her even farther away from her peers. It all comes to a head on Halloween when Ron Weasley gripes that she's terrible and she must have noticed that she has no friends, which leads her to cry for the rest of the day in the girls' toilet. Cue "TROLL! TROLL IN THE DUNGEON! Thought you ought to know."

Now, in the fanfic I was reading, Harry and Hermione met before school, and were best friends for years, to the point where Harry gave her a promise ring(though he was unaware of it's full significance at the time).

Cue Halloween, Ron's rude commentary, and Hermione /still/ spending all day crying in the bathroom because she apparently holds the words of a stranger in higher esteem than that of her close friend.

I still kept reading, but that ridiculously shoehorned in scene just annoyed the piss out of me. I'd have been less annoyed if she just had to go to the loo, and it was just remarkably bad timing.

*** Fics in general that stick practically entirely to the books are so bad. I read this werewolf!harry one where the author basically copy-pasted the entire first book but added a few werewolf-related sentences.

**** /winces/

Ew.

/EDIT/

It's funny. I greatly enjoyed some fics that literally did the same thing, but I suppose context is king.

The fic you're describing sounds like it's trying to be an original story without being original, and so the original text being there doesn't really serve any purpose.

I have, however, enjoyed the /MST3K/ format, where canon characters react to books/stories about themselves...

And I suddenly want to see canon characters reacting to fanfics that run entirely counter to their nature, like Draco reacting to Drarry or Dramione(Either would be hysterical, IMO). Except for Weasley. I really don't want to see canon Weasley reacting to a Weasley bashing fic. That just strikes me as being cruel and canon Weasley already has self-esteem issues.

** Excessive talk of 'masks' in the sense of hiding emotions and projecting a false persona. Especially if the line "they put on their masks" comes into play (unless there is a literal masquerade ball or Death Eaters are getting dressed).
