Most Next Gen seems to be Rose or Albus and I'd like to read something as bit different.

Thanks

  When Annabel meets someone she hasn't seen in many years, her life takes another unexpected turn. How many surprises can she take? Do people really change? Has James Sirius Potter finally grown up? Whatever happened to those brave adventurers, the Drakestone seven? Warning: Language, and some smut.

** There's the [[http://www.jamespotterseries.com][James Potter series by G. Norman Lippert]].

It's not the BEST fanfic series out there -- it's annoyingly American at times, featuring a lot of Americanisms and American characters, including (sigh) exchange students.

But, it IS one of the mose extravagantly-produced fanfics out there. This isn't your average fanfic-posted-on-ff.net, these are professional-looking e-books with painted covers, chapter illustrations, flash sites with outdated-looking CGI trailers and everything.
