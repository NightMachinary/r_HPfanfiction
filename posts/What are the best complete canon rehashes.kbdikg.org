I've read The Arithmancer, the Sacrifices Arc, and the Cupboard Series.


** Complete canon rehashes are hard. The few that don't die in Book 3 or 4 I find tend to go off the rails into "too dark" (honestly, I'm a little worried about that with Animagus at War) or "just plain weird."

The only complete one in my favorites list is the Dangerverse, linkffn(2109424), which sort of exemplifies this. It's massive, gets really dark by the middle, and is filled with mood whiplash. There's a reason I only favorited the first two.

I also have link(13230340). Not complete, but in 6th year with regular updates. Lighter and fluffier and a little bit crack to start with, but fun.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.
