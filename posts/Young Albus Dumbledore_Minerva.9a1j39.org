I've seen this pairing joked about many times. But has anyone ever written it? I would think there could be a really good story centered around the time that Albus has just defeated Grindelwald and is dealing with fame and requests from the ministry. Albus would be moving to headmaster, and all the drama and humor of dealing with the tasks involved with that. Riddle would be starting to gather followers out of Hogwarts, and Albus would be worrying whether he should intervene before he has another Grindelwald. Minerva would be just starting teaching and Albus would be training her as the Transfiguration professor. Not to mention, I would think between Albus's tendency to keep his feelings/secrets/thoughts to himself, and Minerva's no-nonsense approach, they could have an intriguing relationship.


** There's tons written by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/MMADfan/pseuds/MMADfan][MMADfan]]. It's been years since I read any of it, but if I recall correctly, there's a long, long story called Resolving a Misunderstanding that is mostly centered around Minerva's early years at Hogwarts and the start of her relationship with Dumbledore.

** There was a lot of this pairing in the early days of fanfiction.

In fact, I recall one I read just after the reveal that Dumbledore was gay where the author still tried to reconcile the AD/MM ship with the then shocking new revelation.

*** Does that really matter though? Authors write straight characters as gay all the time, so why would it matter the other way around.

*** This is fanfiction it doesn't need to be canon to request it.

That being said, a lot of people (myself included) don't consider interviews/discussions by JK to be canon.

**** She confirmed it in an interview, but he was pretty heavily implied in the books that he was gay.

Not saying fanfiction can't do whatever it wants, of course.
