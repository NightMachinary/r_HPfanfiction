I'm looking for a harry potter/Percy Jackson and olympians crossover.(although it might not be in that particular section of whatever site it was posted on). its a story that starts out with Gaea bearing James potter. he's still married with lily at the time. and much like canon HP. Voldemort shows up, but its Gaea who blocks the Killing curse. harry still ends up at durselys. from what i remember it had only 2-3 chapters at the time. i think the plot summary had the words (and no one knows whos side he's on).Ã‚

i'm not sure if the story is still posted or not and google does not help finding it.
