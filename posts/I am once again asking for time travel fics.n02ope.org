I've read all the Tomarry classics, as well as many of the Harry as the master of death fics. Would prefer something lighthearted like Oh God Not Again. Any pairings are fine really, I just have an aversion to gender swapped characters. Thanks!


** Could I perhaps recommend my own?

  Wherein Harry Potter and Theodore Nott are Auror partners three years after the Battle of Hogwarts, and during an investigation of a criminal coven of witches and wizards, are sent back in time to their eleven-year-old bodies by an old Egyptian ritual. They decide to try and save as many people as possible while researching the ritual that sent them back in time and they change things up along the way; starting with Harry being Sorted in Slytherin.

**** If you enjoy Slytherin Harry- I just read a favorite (not back in time, but Harry goes to Slytherin) called “A Learning Experience”- it's got two sequels and it does justice to Slytherin house.

  How would things have been if Harry had got to know Snape and his Snakes better? A 'Harry in Slytherin' story. Don't groan; it's not that bad! Warnings: mention of sex later on (very mild); typical teenage swearing (mild) and corporal punishment (not graphic or extreme). (Note: the beginning is heavily inspired by Asterix Tutnix.)

** I read an amazing one recently where Snape goes back to Maurader's era and fixes everything. OK- I'm generally not a big Snape shipper (although I love Severitus)- and this DOES end up with a relationship between Snape & Sirius- but it is SOOO good!! Highly recommended, easily my fave “back in time” fic.

  Albus Dumbledore concocts a desperate plan to send Severus back to his last year at Hogwarts and save the Wizarding World from its future fate. What could go wrong? (Certainly not a budding relationship with the person he hated most in the world, nor being thrust into a position of power within the Order of the Phoenix.)

** Time travel is one of my all-time favorite tropes. Since you said you've read most of the Tomarry ones I'll present you with some "Marauders Era Time Travel" or around that time Time Travel fics. Not all are light hearted though but none have a bad ending

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25836640]]) This one is called "Of Gods and Men" and it's a Sirius/Harry fic In the future a disease called "magical consumption" devours wizards and witches, stealing their magic. And somehow the power get's tranfered to Harry, who tried to kill himself the release it but it doesn't work. So he intends to travel back in tim to let himself being killed by Voldemort during the battle, but somehow he ends up in the marauders era where he is forced to pretend to be a student. MoD Harry. Very good engaging story

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4340120]]) Time Turned Back by TaraSoleil. Probably my favorite Harry in the Marauders Era fic. Harry and Hermione both end up in the past. Harry/Sirius Hermione/Remus

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21527806]]) This one is a gen fic called Princeps by Lomonaaeren. The summary should give you a good overview, sequels are also finished. Harry has worked for years as an Unspeakable to identify the best point where he might go back in time to change the impact of Voldemort's war. Now he knows: he will have to return to his parents' Hogwarts years and encourage the Slytherins to stand on their own instead of following a leader. He knows how to assume the post of Defense professor and how to reach the Slytherins. And from there, well, surely nothing can go too wrong.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15930521]]) Step back in time. This one is very good, in which an older battle-worn Harry doesn't quite end up in the marauders era, but around the time his younger self was left on the Durleys doorstep. He basically adopts himself all the while navigating magical Britain, the people who want to meddle with Harry's life and the upcoming rise of the dark Lord. He doesn't take shit from Dumbledore either, young Harry is a sweet kid. Highly recommend. Endgame is Snape/Harry. There are multiple works to this series.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23486791]]) This one is also not a Harry ends up in the Marauders era, but a young Regulus ending up in the future fic. Pairing Harry/Regulus

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15465966]]) Don't know if you know this fic, it's called "The Second String" Harry ends up in the past. He pretends to be a Squib and ends uo working in the Hog's Head. Pairing is Gideon Prewett/Harry Potter. It's a brilliant fic! Highly rec

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3188624]]) Also not Harry in the Marauders era, Snarry fic, features Harry as a Professor

When Harry is accidentally sent back to Hogwarts 1982, he discovers a more bitter and angrier Snape than he knew in his school years. Tasked by Dumbledore with teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts and befriending Snape, as well as finding out how to get back, Harry knows he is in store for a difficult year. Despite their arguing, Harry can't help but find himself drawn to Snape. If Harry and Snape can get over their past and learn to be just a little selfish, their relationship may stand a chance.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1648439]]) Another Snarry fic. Not quite Marauders era either but also good. Things are going poorly for the side of the light, and in a last-ditch effort to fulfill his destiny, Harry goes back in time to try again.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16816447]]) This fic is called the man out of time, not quite what you're looking for, but this is the summary. Harry gets hit with a piece of the veil, and falls into Sirius's past. And back again. Loosely inspired by The Time Traveler's Wife.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23874001]]) This is a rather good and promising WIP in which Regulus Black finds himself in his 3 year younger body after dying in the inferi infested cave. Regulus pov

*And something I think you might also enjoy, especially since those can be quite funny TIME LOOP fics*

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22023307]]) A funny Drarry Time Loop fic. Rivals to Lovers. Harry and Draco both work in the Ministry

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12962190]]) an interesting Snarry fic in which Snape is stuck in a Time Loop. Interesting as it's a unique Snape "character study"

*And even though you said you've read most of them, I'm still gonna leave some Tomarry/fics featuring Voldemort here, maybe there is one you haven't checked out yet*

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23965102][Cacoethes]] Is a fic I recently finished and found very engaging.Tomarry, Features, Time travel, Slytherin!Harry, Kind of a Horcrux bond between Tom and Harry, Grindelwald as a threat

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19949440][Unfogging the future]] Soo good. Pairing (Lavender Brown/Tom Riddle) shouldn't work but works brilliantly. Highly rec Summary: Lavender takes one step forward and -- just like the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the drop of a pebble -- Hogwarts is left behind. There's no jump, no flashes of light, no whirlwinds of disconnected images. Just one little step; behind stood her war and in front stands 1947. "Huh," she says to herself, "didn't see this in the tea leaves."

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2378855][Stand Against the Moon]] contains technically Harry/Death though it's more a Harrymort fic. Nonetheless it checks all boxes in the dark!Harry department. Features Time Travel, Werewolf!Harry, Dark Harry, Dark creatures The sequel is also really good

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24476011][Ouroborus]] WIP in which Voldemort travels back in time and "adopts" his younger self. Very interesting Summary: A strange man adopts Tom Riddle and it is not his father, as Tom desperately wants to believe. Stranded in the past, Voldemort once again comes to the conclusion he's the only one he truly needs.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/284278][If Them's the Rules]] Not quite dark Harry but soo good. Love the worldbuilding and characzerizations. Very on point. WIP Eventual Tomarry

Unable to accept the aftermath of the war, Harry decides to travel back in time to become the parent Tom Riddle obviously should have had. Except that things don't go as planned and Harry finds himself part of a game with hidden rules, trying to survive while raising a boy whose understanding of family has nothing to do with love.

This one [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/790488][World in Pieces]] is not quite a time travel but dimension travel fic. I absolutely love this one. Summary: Harry is summoned to an alternate universe still suffering under Voldemort less than an hour after his own defeat of the bastard. Worse, he's not the first Harry Potter they've called on this way. Worst yet (at the moment), there is no way back home. But give Harry time, and he's likely to find something that's even worse

Also additionally a shameless *self-rec* here. linkao3(The Master of Death by Quine)

Don't know if you're interested as it's a wip and the pairing is Harry with male!Death. Premise: Years after the war, Harry Potter lives an apathetic life. When Death offers him a second chance he takes it. Accompanied by the being, Harry travels back to the summer before Sirius dies. Inside his younger body and the memories of an older self, Harry realizes that being connected to Death may have twisted his morals a little more than expected. Seeking to make up for the boredom of past years, Harry isn't above carving his own space between two sides to even out the playing field.

Some additional info: Basically, MoD!Harry get's influenced by Death and slowly turns dark, though he starts out rather grey already. I've put a bit of focus on Dumbledore's manipulative side as to justify some resentment Harry displays. He's not a dark Lord, more indy!Harry. I've got a few cliché tropes in there but it isn't my intention to delve too much into them. Basically his main motivations are to reunite Voldemort's soul and getting Sirius a trial but he doesn't care much for anything else but Death

** Ah, I was going to suggest "The Three Sisters" by mumuinc, but nevermind, since it's Female Harry (really worth it though, I'm squealing over it haha). [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29799375/chapters/73309881]]. I really suggest you give it a try! It's both light-hearted and dark by moments (canon level). Holly Potter is attacked at the Dursleys, and her aunt sacrifies herself to protect her. Holly then accidentally wakes up in the past, in her 11 yo body, and is found by her mother and aunt, both children.

Have you read "The Turning of Times"? [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10413771/chapters/22996143]]. Don't really remember much, haven't finished it yet. There's a lot of world building, and Harry strikes up a friendship with Snape. Obviously, Harry's in 1975-1976.

There's also "The Heir of House Black" by ravenclawblues. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20459714/chapters/48544922]]. Harry is Master of Death, and after a few deaths, he can't go back to his time, but he wants to prevent his family from getting killed, so he accepts to go to the past. Surprise, he's reborn as Sirius' and Regulus' prodigious older brother, and h'es very protective.

And finally, "Strange Visitors from Another Century" by Izzyaro. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/519887]]. Harry, Ron, and Hermione find themselves 1000 years in the past, and they must find a way back to their time. Fluff, dark and gruesome battles.

  After looking into Snape's pensieve, Harry makes up his mind to take charge of his actions---but before he can, he is sent back in time to 1975. He must find his own way back to the future without upsetting the time line, but the Dark Lord is on the rise, and Harry's never been good at keeping his head down.Canon Divergent after "Snape's Worst Memory" in OotP.Warnings in author's notes.

  It was the year 2003 and Wizarding Britain was finally starting to heal from the wounds of the Second Wizarding War. However, a growing number of Dark wizarding activities across Europe and political impasse in the Wizengamot threatened to destroy the fragile society once and for all. But who was the enemy? Was it just the remnant supporters of Voldemort or was it the rise of a new Dark Lord? 23-year-old Deputy Head Auror Harry Potter tried to get to the bottom of this mystery but there was simply not enough time. There was simply nothing he could do to save the world at this point... Unless he could go back in time and stem the tides... This is a journey of family, of friendship, of self-discovery, and, as always with Harry Potter, a healthy dose of world-saving.(Master of Death Harry Potter/ Rebirth/ Time Travel Fix-It/ Marauders Era)Updates once every two to three weeks. Inspired by Tsume Yuki's "Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is" and with her expressed permission, this is the author's fiction re-imagined.Link: [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is]

** Lighthearted time travel? There is nothing better than In the Bleak Midwinter by TheLoud.

Spoilers for the first chapter: Hermione travels back in time to raise a few weeks old Tom Riddle to be better. Looking for support, she knocks on the door of Tom's father, who then takes very well to the wizard of world (despite the trauma from Merope's abuse).

Told from the perspective of Tom's father.

** Hello! There have been some really good recommendations here.

There's a completed Drarry series on Ao3 called 'Do It All Over Again', told from Draco's perspective. He time travels prior to first year to begin mending his relationship with Harry, as he believes that this will ensure his future survival. I really enjoyed this series because it touched on a lot of realistic conversations between characters, mental health issues, insecurities and the realistic portrayal of trauma.

Link: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/853760]]

There was also an uncompleted 'Harry is a Black' reincarnation fic on fanfiction.net, which I've forgotten the name of. I know it's not time travel, but Harry is reincarnated into an alternate reality, as ten year old wizard, where this reality's Harry survived Godric's Hollow only to die in a car crash at five. Harry poses as Sirius's illegitimate son and legally gets him out of Azkaban. He mingles with other Black family members and it gets quite political towards the end. If anyone knows this fic, you're welcome to comment :)))
