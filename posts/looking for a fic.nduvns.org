:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
hi üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è it's me again i found the previous fic i've been looking for(it's snake whisper by veysha (Toothiana) if anyone is interested) so i'll be looking for another one lol i've lost way too many fics over the years. but back to the topic. FIC IS ABOUT i don't really remember what. but i remember that harry was adopted by voldemort. and voldemort was a politician in opposition to dumbledore. i think grindewald is still around but not 100% sure if that. during the quidditch cup someone attacked with wizards and trolls. and the authors were trying to stun the troll and people were dying. and harry decided fuck it. he killed a troll and told the woman with a child to go to the station since it's currently the safest place to be in. then he used a sonorous charm and told everyone to hide in the stadium since it has wards. then he went to help others. he briefly came to the stadium where his friends were and put them to work. and then went out again. and when voldemort came he got scolded for not keepin himself safe. and i think voldemort and dumbledore teamed up agains the minister who didi t allow the aurors to harm the trolls while people were still dying. and taht pretty much alll i remember of that fic lol if anyone ha say idea where it may came from i would be very very grateful.

Edit: found it ‚ÄòThrough your black hair, my hands' by Marcell13


** Not sure if this is the one, but what you described sounds like 'Through your black hair my hands' on ffnet and Wattpad. The scene you described happens later in the fic.

*** i'll read it anyway xD and come back to you if it's not this one probably is though lol

THANK YOU SO MUCH i've been stuck cause i usually remember a certain scene and they are very random. and then i don't have the patience to read through the whole fic to find it as they usually are further back xD
