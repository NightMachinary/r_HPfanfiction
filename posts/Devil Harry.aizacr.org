*** I enjoyed it too. A shame it followed a cliche romance which pushed me away.

**** It is going to Netflix now and according to the lead actor, no longer being restricted to the rules of the channel they were in, they will be able to do more with the show and follow more the "edgy" tone of the source material.

** I swear, most of the comments in this sub could be replaced by [[/r/subredditsimulator]] and nobody would even fucking notice.

I don't know of anything where Harry is literally Satan, it's something about the fandom thatreally bugs me to be honest. So little exploration of traditional mythologies outside of anime crossovers and those are almost universally dogshit because God forbid than an author try to come up with something original. Here are some that come close-ish to what you're looking for:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7370842/1][The Worse Muggles Imaginable]] The Dursleys are satanists Harry may or may not be the literal son of Satan. Fantastic fic. Doesn't get recced here much because people seem to get off on repeatedly reccing the same narrow set of fics.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4452626/chapters/10116017][This Is Not The Chosen One You're Looking For]] Harry gets swapped with the antichrist in the hospital. Crossover with something called Good Omens. I think it's okay but I haven't read it in a very long time.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8796596/1/][Fallen]] Harry gets summoned in the universe of Buffy the Vampire Slayer where everyone and everything mistakes him for Satan. Not the best written and not worth reading clear-headed.
