:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There was this fanfiction I read a while ago where Remus and Sirius had a daughter and she was maybe a werewolf too? And that since Sirius was in prison Remus raised her on his own. I do remember that she was in a relationship with one of the weasley twins. Since I have obviously forgotten the name any help would be greatly appreciated. This was one of my favorite works and I just wanted to read it again.

Thanks for all of your helpðŸ˜˜


** It's possibly The Littlest Lupin by MissandMaurader, but I'll admit it's been ages since I read that since it's a WIP that hasn't updated since 2018 so I could be wrong.

  Desperate times call for desperate measures, and when Remus Lupin finds himself at his last galleon, he turns to his very last option and becomes a sperm donor. Little does he know, he will soon father our favourite little know-it-all, Hermione Granger. Cover art by Fine Mournings.
