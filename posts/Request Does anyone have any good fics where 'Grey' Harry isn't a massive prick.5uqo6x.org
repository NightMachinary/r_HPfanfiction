Dumbledore did dabble in powerful 'dark' magic when he met Grindelwald, the twinkle could be a side effect of that, just like the red eyes were a side-effect of many rituals he probably performed. I'm not saying magic can't be done or be created from great malicious intent, or fueled by such intent, but to say that certain magics are purely one-sided is preposterous. You could use the imperius curse, crucio, and the killing curse for just as much good as you could for bad. If someone is attempting to kill another wizard and they are extremely resilient to other forms of magic, you could imperio them to make them stop. You could use crucio to get out vital information that could save the world. And you can use the killing curse in self-defense.

The first that comes to mind is the Sacrifices Arc. It has dark and light magic, and it explains a bit about what that means because the distinction is important to the story.

  Introducing black and white concepts already makes it a worse story.
#+end_quote

This is about the magic system. A magic system that contains simple-to-understand categories with concrete differences between parts of it doesn't impair the story.

Black and white /conflicts/ tend to be less satisfying. They're more appropriate for children than adults. That's because humans are adept and experienced in dealing with the motivations of other humans, so a black and white conflict just doesn't ring true.

When it comes to worldbuilding that isn't based on humans, you might as well complain that it's bad storytelling to have a concrete difference between mammals and birds, that that's too black and white.
