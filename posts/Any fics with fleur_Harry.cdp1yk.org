Would like a fic with something kind of like this happening. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/bmjtne/would_love_to_see_a_harryfleur_scene_like_this/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app]] Or just any good Harry/fleur,Harry/Gabrielle, or harry/daphne fics


** I don't know of any fics with that exact type of scene but Linkffn(A Cadmean Victory) is pretty good and complete.

*** I really liked this fic. It does a good job of showing the consequences of Slytherin!Uber!Harry acting of his own accord, while still being a near-canon rehash.

It's kind of like if JKR had written a loner power fantasy instead of a mystery.

**** Yeah it's only of my favorites. The author just does a good job at writing in general and I like the loner aspect of the story.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** It doesn't have a scene like that, but linkffn(In Spite of Obstinate Men by Quatermass) is a pretty good Harry x Fleur fic, it also has a sequel.

Linkffn(Euphoria by Viscount Anarchy) is another good HP/FD fic, the summary doesnt do it justice.

**** For Euphoria: I love Ron's characterization. Very refreshing from all the bashing, he was a true friend to Harry and Hermione. Everything was very tasteful. The summary of the story is underwhelming imho, but it did get me to click on it, so it worked out.
