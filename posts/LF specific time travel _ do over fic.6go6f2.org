I'm looking for a specific fic that I remember reading and enjoying. I've spent an hour or so with Google to no avail so I'm hoping someone here can help. Here's what I remember:

Harry travels back in time somehow and sets up a company dedicated to researching ways to make his younger self's life easier. He employs lots of people; the heads of department become like a family to him. He has a security team that are able to practice in a room like the Room of Requirement that can simulate battles. I think they are able to intervene with the events in the graveyard where Voldemort is reborn. I think Remus is one of his employees, but not sure on that one.

Sorry it's not much but I hope this rings a bell with somebody!

  Harry and his friends ingested love potions; great - he could deal with that. But knowing that he found this out before and the people he trusted sent him back in time without his memory, to relive his past, again and again? Not this time if he had anything to say!

  Rita spouting lies, branded as a Dark wizard and goblins in a rage; Harry's had enough. So, he seeks to jump back in time to save himself from a life of misery and fickle loyalty, maybe a little revenge and mysteries along the way.Time Travel! A Harry raises himself fic. Non-epilogue compliant, non-slash.
