Good day everyone,

I'm writing my first ever fic, it's going to be quite long and I'm fairly early on in the writing (~6k words) though I have at least 5 book-length stories planned. I'm wondering about some things though:

1. Where to start posting?
2. How often to post? And how much per post?
3. How can I find someone who will keep me accountable to keep working on it - I work full time and I'm going to graduate school and there have been weeks where I didn't get to write anything. Those that have written, did you find people being interested pushed you to keep working on it?

Any advice or suggestions?

*** Thanks for the reply!

1. Yeah it seemed like ff.net was a good option as it gets linked to quite a bit but I'm really new to ff and wanted to see if there was a newer site getting more traffic.

2. That's some impressive output. But thank you for the publishing schedule, I thought it might be a monthly deal like comic books...

3. Thanks.

Thanks for all the tips! I really should add some stuff to my spell checker...

  Some people also ask questions via the anonymous review function, but too bad for them because registering an account is easy. Don't be tempted to answer them.

That piece of samsungfutanari69's advice seems pointlessly dickish to me, though. I advise against it. (Though I agree that if someone with an account asks a question in a review, better to answer them in a PM.)

** Don't start posting until your first story (at least) is complete.

Get a beta lined up if you possibly can (you might want to have a reciprocal arrangement), but don't ask them to start reading until the story is complete and as polished as you can get it yourself. Also read a lot and write a lot of constructive criticism of others' work. It really helps with your own writing.

Write the story you want to read because unless you are writing something very formulaic there is no guarantee of feedback (and even then I'm not so sure). Do not rely on encouragement from others to keep you motivated.

Don't respond to negative comments for at least twenty-four hours.

** My advice (worth about what you pay for it) is to hold off posting until at least the first book is complete. Then post a chapter a week or a chapter every two weeks. This will give enough time for folks to notice your story and follow it, but not so much time between updates as to lose track.

At a minimum, post on fanfiction.net since it has the most traffic. Ao3 is growing in popularity, so you may as well post there as well.

Most good writers are self-driven. They don't need some person telling them to write.

*** That makes sense, give a cushion to start.

Sounds good.

I'd like to think I'm a decent writer, and I'm fairly motivated... I was more looking for a partner who I can bounce ideas and so we can keep each other on track.
