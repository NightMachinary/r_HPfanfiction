I thought up two potion based on how I thought felix felici was brewed.

The way the felix felicis is brewed in my head canon is by using Mackled malaclaw venom increasing the effect of the bad luck it causes(because it's easier to make a negative effect worse)and then inverting the effect of the venom so that it gives good luck.

The two potions I thought up involved Unicorn blood

The first is made by destroying the healing effect of the blood (because it's Easier to destroy a positive effect) and then enhancing the curse the blood gives for drinking it and then Inverting the Curse to create a potion that give a blessing equal to how bad the curse of the unicorn blood would have give. It would be even more dangerous to get wrong than felix felicis.( The potion could also be used to Break any curse on a person even the ones like the blood curse that led to Astoria Greengrass early death).

The other involved Invering the effects of unicorn blood makeing it a poison that would be able to kill anyone but would grant a blessed/pleasant death. Then destroying the the blessing before enhancing the poisonous effect of the blood before inverting again to create a potion that could heal anything.

I quite like the idea of potion were you enhance the negative effect it would give before inverting the effect.( and inverting a positive into a negative so that it is easier to make worse before inverting it into a positive again)

You could also use it for evil by inverting the effect of Phonix tears and then enhancing its negative effect to make a poison that not even phonix tears could heal.


** Goblin coins are enchanted to self-stack; gold with gold, silver with silver, bronze with bronze. There are children's games about flipping knuts to guess how they'll stack. It also serves as a simple way to detect fake ones- toss a handful onto a special plate and the real ones stack as expected, leaving the fakes to land haphazardly.

This is how they keep stacks of coins in the vaults under control, and all the magic for it is embedded in the runes along the edge. The coins begin as strips of flat wire, inscribed with their particular magic as each coin is spooled into a disk. They are then stamped and the final inscriptions are laid on the outer edge, including a complex mark identifying the minter -- e.g.: Thriftgilder's work #11005.

*** Hmm...actually, that's a rather ingenious trick in itself; inscribe runes on flat wire before rolling it into a disk, you gain a considerable amount of surface area for crafting. Rune it on both sides, then add thin circular plates on the top and bottom which also each have runes inscribed on both sides...that's a lot of room for coding. Throw in a little power supply in the core of the 'coin', then...

...What, exactly? What kind of enchantment would you inscribe in such a medal/coin?

** Muggle magic was an idea I was kicking around and still am to an extent. Essentially, the difference between magicals and muggles is that magicals are able to draw energy directly through themselves to preform magic, while muggles must use 'ambient' magic to do the same, making casting much more difficult and requiring groups working together or long spans of time to accomplish things.

For example, say a particular family has a habit of knocking on doorways for luck or safety before exiting/entering a building. Over time, belief and repetition build up power until the action actually becomes a form of magic and does what it is intended to do; protect the one preforming the action. The family does this for generations, and eventually a magical child is born when the family has drawn on power in this manner for so long it embeds itself in them. This means that often, muggleborns have no clue where their magic came from, because they may not have a magical relation at all.

An idea I had related to this was there may be pockets of 'muggles' that know about this ability to draw on ambient magic, and form little hidden communities for fear of being attacked for the magic they preform. So there are essentially hidden societies of magicals, and hidden societies of 'magical muggles', and normal muggles, all of which have some level of magical ability under the right circumstances.

Muggles can preform more powerful magic than small parlor tricks like the door knocking example by gathering together and believing hard enough in preforming a ritual. More people and belief equating to more power. Having a 'magical' take part can act as a catalyst and make this kind of intentional magic much more potent.

In this setting, Squibs would simply be the opposite of a Muggleborn. Where a muggleborn happens due to belief and repetition of a using small magics over time, a Squib happens when a magical family begins to simply take magic for granted and starts to just assume they can do it without thought or care or any reverence for the casting. Because magic ceases to be something they think about and put effort into concentrating and caring about, the magic can simply leave their line.

I suppose that means that magic would also be 'semi-sentient' in this scenrario, at least enough to know if it is being taken for granted or not.

Regardless, its a nice thought experiment, and would be fun to play with in a fic that's focused heavily on blood status or politics. Watching the purebloods flip out after learning muggles are technically magical as well would be quite fun I think. : )

** This would require changing the rules slightly, but it makes a backwards sort of sense.

Belief supports or confounds magic. Doing a spell witnessed by a stadium full of muggles should be nearly impossible, unless it's to make everyone ignore something magical.

When amidst muggles, spells are weaker -- or visibility makes overt magic throw alarms, so everyone is taught to hide the magic.

Amidst the magical, great effects can be initiated and are often feared, as the community is taught to believe what they see, to an extent. Little pockets of dynamic reality are tracked and secured and protected from accidental detection.

Why? Because Reality doesn't like to be bent.

Thus, the growth of worldwide intercommunication and the resultant skepticism is making magic harder and harder to accomplish.

**** And that idea along with a forum discussion, prompted this intriguing dystopia:

[[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=25186]["I want ... the Harry Potter story redone in a cyberpunk setting. Yes, still with magic. No, not like Shadowrun."]]

The essence of cyberpunk is deterioration. Apathy and isolation define the outlook and humanity seems less human each year, as body parts are replaced with machine, clothing and even skin is rented out to advertisers just to maintain a meager standard of living. Innovation is both constant and absent- any new idea seems to be gamed out to its furthest use before patents can even be registered. Diversity is everywhere, making it homogenous. Crime is everywhere, making it societally acceptable, even contractural.

It's a corporate-driven worldwide culture of consumerism without context.

And what is magic? Wonder, framed by belief and empowered by a connection to life.

Of course the theme is magic vs. technology.

Assume that all the magical monsters (large or hard to ignore) have been either killed or domesticated. The magical world was revealed but the only ones who believed it were the kooks and the power-brokers at the top, who immediately saw the potential of untapped technologies and the threat of a race dedicated to cutthroat commerce (goblins).

The problem came as magic got harder to squeeze in or sneak by. Reality had a way of imposing itself through its observers- if people couldn't believe that a dragon was really flying above them, it wasn't- it became a weakened monster, no doubt escaped from some lab and likely to give off toxic fumes as it decomposed. In this environment, magic doesn't disrupt technology; tech disrupts magic.

Somewhere down in the dregs, in the infrastructure where the simulated sunlight and security monitors don't penetrate, where the hum of motors and clanking of pipes is vibrating the cement apart, is where the last Potter is raised by her father.

As he lay dying, he charges his daughter with a quest- "Go find the magic. I've told you the stories told to me. Find it. Bring it back. Do the impossible, as often as you can, until they start to believe again."

** I thought of the Draught-of-most-likely-Improbability, which is used to have inter-species kids, like Hagrid.

I have a small scene in which lily is commissioned to brew it and shows it to Harry. It's color is perfect if every time you glance at it, the color is changed and it bubbles in cube-formed-bubbles. It needs to be brewed over a fire with 100 negative degree Celcius temperatures, not to mention that it's core ingredients are tricky to find and refine. You need the middle eye of a three eyed salmon, scrapings of a Wendigo's heart, the feathers of a Thunderbirds third pair of wings and the horn of a bull summoned by a Levitation Charm gone wrong. It also must be begun and finalized by someone who has never before succesfully started and finished a potion, preferably someone who actually tried to do it before.

In the bit of story that I have, Lily is later confronted with the consequences of this commission, as Moody tells her that the woman that took it was off her rocker, had a kid with an Acromantula and was eaten when she tried to live together with the father of the kid. Lily, feeling responsible even if Moody assures her that the Apothecary was to blame, adopts the little Arachnotaur and raises her as Harry's little half-spider-sister.

As the fic is a one-chapter death I think it still counts. Maybe someone finds it funny and uses it.

** Personal theory: Magic is affected by willpower. You are, in effect, imposing your will over reality. The more certain you are of yourself and your abilities, the stronger your magical power is. This often often contributes to sociopathic and narcissistic personalities among powerful wizards, as the self-delusions such mental illnesses are capable of producing actually strengthens the wizard's spells.

** I'm still sitting on the idea with the binding magical contracts.

Pretty much every time I've seen them, said contracts make you lose your magic through some unexplained method if you don't fulfil them, or they make your body move on its own to complete the task ala Sleeping Beauty.

He awakens on his own years later in a fallout/elder scrolls/brutal legend crossed universe and slowly becomes an artificer that was part necromancer/part assassin who creates a bitching car to save the world along with a guerilla band made of animated gorillAs and restore it. I tore that idea apart and it became an original novel where a young boy awakens to find his family missing. He has to track them down in a postapoc world and save them. Called him Vinnie Menelaus. The car got dumped and the guerilla bamd of gorillas became a random encounter in a dnd campaign i wrote then a random encounter in all IRB Studios apps.

** I've recently toyed with the idea that there are levels of magical fighting. Normal level is traditional spell casting - shooting spells at each other, shields, etc. Next level is using environment and transfiguration and the weather, things like that.

The final level and this is basically Voldemort and Dumbledore, is that legilimens use their skill to read their opponents mind and know what their opponent will do before they do it. So they destroy all weaker opponents. But when two fighters meet at this level, their battle takes place entirely in the mindscape, where they fight 'physically' because there are no wands or spells, just one person's magic against other's.
