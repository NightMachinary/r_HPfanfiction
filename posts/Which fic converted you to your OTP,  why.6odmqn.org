I'm a die-hard Snape/Hermione shipper, but I didn't start out that way. It was when I cautiously gave "The Other Side of Darkness" by Abby a chance that my eyes were suddenly opened and I became devoted to that pairing because of how dynamic, flawed, and believable the characters were written. Plus, it alleviated my initial distaste for the age gap by setting it post-Hogwarts and playing into their personalities for a mystery to solve together.

What was it for you, and why?


** For me in the last few months, it's been Harry/Luna. I'll always be open to a good Harry/Daphne, but I think Luna is perfect for Harry. A lot of the books is Harry struggling to find his identity amidst the expectations of the people around him. Someone like Luna who's so open, and accepts Harry for who he is, and not who she wants him to be would be really good for him.

**** Yep... a shame that Luna is so hard to write. There's not very many Harry/Luna fics and most of those that exist don't get Luna right (she's either borderline psychotic or too normal... or the 'she's a seer'-stereotype which is also terrible). Why can't she just be a quirky girl that sometimes says odd things that may or may not have deeper meaning depending on whether she's pranking you right now or not?

*** That's one way of putting it, but Luna is also kind of unstable and damaged herself, so while it might work out like you say it could also be the worst idea ever because if they allow each others delusions (her creatures and his always Mr. Nice-Guy-I-Only-Stand-Up-For-My-Friends-Never-For-Myself-because-I-am-Worthless routine) they might really never gain a stable personality...I still think both should seek therapy because neither have dealt with their issues!

** I am also an SS/HG shipper (there are far more of us than you would think) for me it was a combination of things. I am older than the average reader of fic and was already an adult and parent when I first read HP. I also accept that relationships with age gaps can be loving and functional (I am 11 years older than my husband.) One of the very first fics I ever read was Chasing the Sun by Loten. It was so beautifully written I was captivated, so I searched out other fics featuring the pairing. The more I thought about it the more it just made sense to me.

And of course the tiny problem of Hermione (She-Who-Knits) ever getting together with an ex Death Eater. As someone else already said, you really have to make both of them extremely OOC to make it work (and all that effort so that Hermione gets together with an edgy genius as a foil and poor Sevvy finally finding his muggle born romance?)

****** I haven't read any time travel backwards ones with the pairing where they are both in character so I agree with you on that.

I was thinking about linkffn(Severus, Redux) where Snape created a time potion that accidently time travels him forward to Harry's 6th year (where he ends up as a time clone since original Snape is still around). Hermione gets roped in by Dumbledore to help the younger Snape settle in and he ends up being completely cut off from his house, death eater friends, and has to basically start over and ends up somewhat befriending her. I feel like their friendship/romance in this fic is not to contrived and makes sense.

Although for better or worse, Alan Rickman is kind of fused with Snape's book character now, also people seem to have differing opinions on his character so it's sometimes hard to say what exactly is OC behaviour and what isn't.

Oh yeah I need to be fair here: I mostly just disagree strongly with the interpretation of Snape's character with most SS/HG authors and it makes me angry to read the kind of apologism (and creative reinterpretation of history "poor innocent Severus mercilessly bullied by evil Marauders) required. The only good way for me to enjoy such a fic (same for Dramione) is if it doesn't make excuses and features an extensive redemption ark. But since authors in those genres (for some inexplicable) reason adore Snape/Draco it rarely happens.

It's a problem in general: I like HHr so I'm already mostly on the same page as authors who write that pairing. I'm not fundamentally opposed to Harry/Ginny but 99.99% of stories in that genre assume that I found their canon "romance" convincing and am already "on board" (including all the assumptions about Ginny that aren't in the books, but extrapolated from her archetype). There's only one pairing that I will never read (Ron/Hermione), but many of the big ones make way to many assumptions about their audience - so there's often little point in trying. That's why something rare like Harry/Susan is nice, the author actually has to make it convincing.

Especially when Snape starts making comments how Hermione is the brightest witch of her generation (Don't these people remember that he considers her a know it all and does not give a damn about her book smarts?) Or when she starts thinking about how hot he is, I mean really?.. Most HG/SS are just unreadable to me.

I don't think she despises Snape though. I may have read too much fanfiction so I am not sure what exactly is canon now, but I don't remember her attitude towards him being super strong even after he insults her. I thought she still attempted to correct Harry and Ron to address him properly and given him the benefit of the doubt (at least before he kills dumbledore). I don't think it's impossible for her to develop a friendship or something more with him while still being in character.

Since then, i have been on a Harry-Ron-Hermione or trio ship kick. I enjoy them for basically expanding on the close relationship they have in canon and capturing the dynamic between the trio. Not to mention some of the smutfics are pretty good in exploring the feelings of the trio as they develop their romance

Also I was tired of seeing Ron not given the same focus Harry and Hermione usually gets in fanfiction. The bonus of Trio ship fics in my view is the utter lack of Ron-bashing or even him being overlooked because he doesnt seem to be important in the books. I blame the movies and DH for his horrid portrayal. Furthermore a lot of these fics were written pre DH and even HBP, so Ron is usually written pretty competent, with fierce loyalty towards his other two companions.

So, in practice, I'm /very/ pairing flexible. I go through phases where I'll gravitate towards one pairing or another, but I'll read pretty much any of them. Dramoine (with a strong preference for post-war or AU) is a reoccurring favorite, although no specific fics stand out. Again and Again by Athey has given me a certain fondness for Harry/Voldemort.

** Remus/Sirius for me, but it was the Shrieking Shack scene in PoA that made me start shipping them, not a fic. I wasn't involved in the HP fandom (or any other) at that point and had no idea about shipping or slash, so I thought that I was the only person who thought they seemed kinda gay. Imagine my surprise several years later when I stumbled on the HMS Wolfstar SCUSA thread on FictionAlley Park and realized that not only was I super duper not alone, but there were people writing stories about them! In the intervening years, I'd learned that fanfiction existed and even read a few here and there, but that was the moment where it became a regular part of my life.

**** I think that stuff must have been after my time or something, because I remember very little werewolf-related "mates" stuff back when I was reading R/S most actively, or maybe I just hung out in different corners of the fandom, since it's not a trope I was particularly interested in for R/S (or in general). There was definitely no a/b/o stuff, because it hadn't been invented yet.

I've been meaning for years to go back through my old HP bookmarks and see what's still out there and what vanished in some purge or something, so I don't really have any specific recs offhand, but a few of my favorite R/S authors were [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/musesfool/pseuds/victoria_p][musesfool]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/ignipes][ignipes]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Thistlerose][thistlerose]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/sheafrotherdon/pseuds/sheafrotherdon][sheafrotherdon]], and [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/Penknife][penknife]].

The really popular epic fic back then was [[http://shoebox.lomara.org/shoebox-pdf-chapters/][The Shoebox Project]]. It's a little twee sometimes, but I liked it overall and it had some very nice art.

** I first got into HG/SS my first semester of college, over a decade ago. My roommate introduced me to fanfiction, and said "But don't read the Snape and Hermione stuff, that's just gross." So I immediately googled "Snape Hermione fanfiction" and started reading. I read HG/SS exclusively for more than five years.

Even though it wasn't really one particular story that got me into the pairing, I do remember the story that transitioned me from reading-because-my-roomate-told-me-not-to to reading-because-I-like-it. It was linkffn(The Fire and the Rose). Mind you, this story came out in 2002, even before Order of the Phoenix, and very little was known of Snape's backstory at the time. I feel like Snape as a character is a lot creepier and less savory with his canon backstory as we know it now than he was then. I really disliked the whole pining-for-Lily aspect of his character that was revealed in DH. That's not romantic, that's creepy. Before then, I saw him as a bitter, unpleasant man that no one really liked (and he didn't like anyone else, either) who made some really stupid choices in his youth, but who had reached a turning point (NOT the whole prophecy/Potter thing, remember I got into fanficiton before that was revealed) and decided to change his life. I saw him as a Granny Weatherwax--someone who is temperamentally inclined to darkness, whose natural impulses and instincts are dark and mean and petty and base, but who has consciously decided not to give into those instincts and has to fight that battle every moment of every day. Someone with a strict moral code to hold darker impulses in check--with the line of acceptability drawn in a different place than most people's, but where it is drawn it is absolute and unyielding. An unpleasant, unmitigated bastard who you would never really consider a friend, but who you could trust with your life if you needed to.

And then the sixth and seventh books came out, and we discovered that the true core of Severus Snape was unrequited pining. Instead of a complex character with a message that choice supersedes nature and good isn't necessarily nice or pretty or pleasant, we got a nasty man whose flimsy redemption was "but LOVE!" and my heart broke a little because of the lost potential. And that's why HG/SS is still my OTP even though the whole student/teacher thing is super creepy and even just the age gap is rather unsettling (even though as a person with a spouse 17 years my senior you might think I wouldn't find it unsettling, it still is)--because I miss my head-canon Snape that never really existed and through fanfiction I can catch a glimpse of him sometimes.

*** I loved Fire and the Rose too! Yes, you hit the nail on the head why I support SSHG...I got into the pairing long before JKR cheated his character. I have read several DH-compliant SSHG stories that were actually good and included the Lily part, but also managed to weave a more complex character in addition to it.

Seriously, Snape had so much potential and depth, and then JKR just ruined it. I never bought that Dumbledore would "completely" trust Severus just by seeing his patronus. He was loyal to Lily before, yet that didn't stop his servitude to Voldemort... Dumb.

The best SSHG fics in my opinion ignore a lot of the Canon explanations and invent their own, while staying true to the personality each character. Many times, authors create such high-quality, believable scenarios that I prefer them to the Canon (and I sometimes forget it isn't).

*** Yeah the Weasleys are a really peculiar family unit and even though their interactions are extremely idealized by JKR I never saw them as a good fit for either Harry or Hermione. I usually rail on about how unhappy Hermione would be married to Ronald, but the opposite is true just as much: Can anyone see Ron truly happy being married to a career driven woman who doesn't cook for him?

And for Harry I've always seen him needing some kind of period of normalcy after the war, because all of his past interactions - in some way - revolved around being The-Boy-Who-Lived and fighting Voldemort. Immediately reattaching to his "high school sweetheart" seems like a giant mistake and prevents him from finding an identity of his own choosing (I don't hate Ginny and I think a spunky redhead telling Harry what's what is great, but she is way too attached to Harry Potter the hero and would hold him back). Oh, and I'm sure she doesn't want to be with a boy who fell for her just because she's hot. Let's be honest, Harry has a lot of growing up to do (not his fault, but crushing on Cho and then Ginny says a lot).

One word about Arthur: He seems like a nice guy but I can't respect his laid back approach. It makes me mad when I imagine Harry trying to emulate him, because it's the only father he knows well. It would be really easy for Harry to fall in the trap of being passive...

**** I get where you're coming from but I disagree on a few points:

The Weasleys do represent normalcy for Harry, normalcy of a family that loves him. It makes complete sense for him to remain attached to that after the war. His relationship with Ginny during his 6th year was a respite from the war. It was what his life would be like if it were normal.

"Reattaching" to Ginny is him finding his identity of his own choosing. Clearly, Harry dating Ginny is about the identity Harry always wanted, that of a normal bloke. I don't see Ginny holding him back from finding his identity; she is just at his side when he does his searching.

Ginny dated Dean in Harry's 6th year, but based on her friendship with Hermione, who clued into Harry's feelings early on in HBP, it's a bit safe to assume Ginny realized Harry liked her well before she actually broke up with Dean. Even after the break, Ginny didn't immediately go to Harry. If she was as attached to the hero as you say she is, I imagine she would've dumped Dean immediately and started dating Harry. But that didn't happen. Rowling was pretty clear that Ginny was meant to get over her "hero worshipping" of Harry by the time they got together. Now, maybe you don't think she effectively portrayed that, which is totally fair. But that was clearly the intention of the author.

It's also pretty clear that Harry didn't fall for Ginny because she is hot; otherwise he probably wouldn't noticed her earlier when the rest of the male population had clearly come to that conclusion. Harry fell for her because he actually spent time with her and realized how great she is in his eyes.

That's a complete fantasy. Did they even have one serious/meaningful conversation since the "I was possessed by Tom too" since Book 5? They are just hormonal teenagers who have the hots for each other... Ginny plays quidditch and she is hot... that's it. Cho plays quidditich and she is hot. There's a clear pattern here.

The books are written from Harry's POV... if I don't know her (and I don't... okay, I know that she's a bitch to other women... Fleur/Hermione) he doesn't know her (or all important interactions of them happen off-screen and JKR is a shit writer). He's completely superficial about his romantic interests... and it's no surprise considering his childhood and previous interactions.

****** Uh, yeah they do have plenty of conversations. The whole point of the chapters in HBP set during the summer is to show them interacting, joking around, and just enjoying being around each other. It is even mentioned on the Hogwarts express when Ginny leaves with Dean that Harry had become so used to Ginny being around during the summer. Recall the many times Ginny made Harry laugh, for example.

I personally agree with you that it would've been nice for more drawn-out conversations with Ginny (the library scene in OOTP being the only really good example of that).

The point of Cho was that she was pretty and liked Quidditch. But Harry realizes that doesn't make much of a relationship. Ginny possesses the qualities (humor most importantly) on top of being attractive and into quidditch, that make her work with Harry.

Get Real! Her boyfriend just got violently murdered. And Harry is pissed that she's an emotional mess?! He's a total dick for complainign about the wet snogging! This all just proves my point that he's not ready for any kind of serious romantic relationship (not that I ship Harry/Cho, they are just as bad for each other at this point in Harry's development). Ginny is just less complicated, because she's just happy to have Harry and doesn't see Hermione as competition. It would have been just as believable if Harry suddenly decided that Cho was the love of his life, I know her just as well as Ginny... actually it would feel a little more satisfying because there'd be some kind of effort involved not this "They are sooo perfect for each other for no apparent reason"-shit (by decree of author).

******** Alright, take it easy. I'm not talking about that. I'm agreeing with you that Harry liked Cho for superficial reasons. Then when he didn't like her personality and her crying (which, I agree with you is a completely justified action at this point) the relationship ended. Regardless of whether Cho is justified to feel and act the way she did, and regardless of whether Harry was wrong for reacting the way he did, clearly it showed Harry and Cho was nothing more than a superficial attraction.

Ginny is clearly different. Yes there is an attraction, and yes they both like quidditch. But Harry, who is more emotionally mature at that point, likes Ginny's personality. Perhaps it is wrong for him to be turned off by a woman expressing her emotions in such a way, but Ginny doesn't do the things that Harry finds unattractive personality-wise. That's all I'm saying here. Harry didn't like Ginny just because she was attractive. Otherwise he'd still be with Cho. If anything his brief thing with Cho showed Harry that he needs to be looking for other attributes in a woman before considering her romantically.

********** Rowling herself made the point to mention that in OOTP, Harry felt embarrassed to be seen sitting on the train with Neville and Luna. By the beginning of HBP, he didn't care at all. I actually think Harry is way more stable his 6th year. One could argue his obsession with Malfoy was a bit much but he was actually completely right. And he seemed to behave more like a normal 16 year old that year, dating, playing qudditch, etc.

i don't think he was searching for a "superficial" relationship. He could've had that with any girl. He was searching for a sense of normalcy, which Ginny did provide.

You can't have it both ways with Ginny. Either she lets Harry run over her like a damsel, or she stands up to him and puts him in his place. In OOTP, she stood up to him. Clearly she had no problem yelling at him. I don't think a girl who is a doormat would do that.

Regarding the break up, that was really was not about Harry just not wanting to invest in a relationship. To think so is to fundamentally misunderstand that scene.

Having said that, I can definitely see where you thinig Ginny is there for whatever Harry needs at the moment. The truth is that not enough time was dedicated to their relationship. Rowling simply chose to highlight why Ginny makes sense for him, and that means ignoring the more day-to-day stuff.

Harry and Ginny make sense together. This is obvious if for no other reason than the author put them together and thus had the responsibility of showing why they make sense together.

The whole issue with the H/G ship, in my opinion, is not whether or not they work together, but whether or not the author did a good job of developing them so that we see it play out over the series rather than just being told about it.

Yeah I realized I said that wrong. And your point is fair. I got a bit caught up in defending the pairing and forgot that I actually have the same gripe with you that Ginny is mostly one way, but in that break up scene she kind of acts against her self. I don't think she was a damsel in that scene, though. She understood Harry had a specific job to do that she couldn't help with. And she needed to do her part and let him go without the guilt associated with it. Not to say she could've interjected more of her personality in that conversation, which we can both agree was a mistake on Rowling's part.

And I like that about you, that you want to rid the world of evil and won't passively sit back like so many others and let others fight your battles for you."

This is what she meant. And it's true. Harry can't be happy just going to school while Voldemort continues to reign terror. And I think it is fair for Ginny to like that about him. It also makes sense because this also accurately sums up Ginny, who would never shy away from being in the thick of it.

As far as their relationship, I do agree it won't be smooth sailing as Harry is a closed-book when it comes to sharing his emotions and would be dealing with a lot of trauma from his past. But...Ginny works for him because she has an innate ability to provide comfort and get Harry to talk about his issues. For me, I feel like the big issue for Harry/Ginny after the war is that Harry might do a poor job of being there for Ginny the way she is for him. She went through a lot too and needs someone to support her. Harry simply hasn't been raised to know to provide that. But based on the epilogue, we can assume he eventually gets the hang of it.

*********** So you take the position that Rowling intentionally set it up so Ginny would never see Harry as anything but a fairy tale hero, and as the writer who wrote them together as a happy couple, she was actually ok with that? Because if you actually think that Ginny really thought that Harry was having the time of his life going after Voldemort and liked him for being the white night laughing as he slayed the dragon, then I can't argue with you.

************ Nono, I think that Rowling is a pretty flawed writer - especially concerning relationships, who had some brilliant world-building and lore ideas. I just reject the notion that there's some secret deeper meaning behind stuff like this that needs to be discovered. It's just bad writing and Rowling didn't consider her own protagonist or what it means when his main love interest says something like this about him. It's just 'bla'. I mean, that's why some people think Book 6 has been largely written by Ghost Writers, because almost all character interactions are horrible and barely recognizable (I actually liked Ginny pre-HBP, but that book almost made me hate my favorite character... Hermione).

Just like she didn't think about what it means when the friendly old Grandpa mentor wizard abandons a child with abusive guardians, admits to have known that he'd have a terrible childhood there and never even bothers to check up or talks to him for ten years. I know that she didn't want to imply that Dumbledore is an asshole, but I'm not going to jump through ridiculous hoops in order to make sense of it.

She's just bad at this kind of stuff... but that doesn't mean I can go into excessive mental gymnastics desperately so that "please dear god please" it could all make sense and wouldn't be so terrible as it appears. There's all kinds of problematic stuff like that in those books, it's not exactly this one exception.

************* That's a pretty fair point and one I've felt myself when it comes to Ginny's story. I actually don't like Ginny in the break up scene since it does seem OOC for her not to fight for Harry in that moment or read him the riot act for being so stupid as to think breaking up would protect her, as if she needed it anyway.

Rowling clearly had characters that were there for Harry to react to or project on. The break up scene is really about Harry, about his sacrifice. So Rowling writes Ginny in a way that doesn't quite make sense, but allows Harry to do what he needs to do.

I don't even hate the idea of Ginny allowing him to go off to war. Logistically it makes sense. He has to do this, she can't follow due to the trace and the fact that the series is about the trio, not the trio plus Ginny. Plus, one could easily argue there is a certain "badassery" of stoically sending your SO off to war and preparing to continue the fight at home. Rowling could have incorporated Ginny's actual personality more in that scene while still arriving at the same ending.

And the mental gymnastics begin again. Fuck the stupid trace. It's barely consistent over the series anyway and never really explained how it's supposed to work. If Rowling wanted to have Ginny join the trio she could have disabled the trace somehow (Arthur still works at the ministry right? Could have been a little mission impossible subplot for him...). Writing her into the trio dynamic would have been hard though and she would have actually done something real with their relationship except Harry pining over the stupid map, so she rather didn't want to bother with all that.

Maybe, but it's really hard to write it convincingly if she's supposed to be such a firebrand...

Just when I think we're coming to a mutual and amicable understanding and somewhat agreement, you go and act all condescending again. I get you don't mean it, but come on.

Regarding Ginny not coming with, not saying Rowling couldn't have easily wrote her into it, but I get that she wanted to keep the story focused on the trio, so i'm not going to kill her for using whatever reason necessary to keep it that way. I personally think it would have made a better story to include Ginny.

  19 years after Hogwarts, the world is perfect. The only selfish, power-crazed person that ever existed was defeated, all the deaths the whole affair brought about quickly forgotten and the happy, naturally developed couples were eager to get started on making babies and giving them awful names. And of course it all worked out exactly like that, duh! What an epilogue!

*** I completely agree with your take on Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione. Personally I ship Harry/Luna for exactly that reason - she has a very calming effect on Harry and that something he would likely need and want after all his trauma.

As for SS/HG, I understand why you would think they'd need to be OOC to work (I thought that too), or the author would need to erase/gloss over Snape's past, but the best ones address it and keep them both true to form. Those are the kinds of fics that sold me.

*** I honestly think Harry would be most comfortable with a Muggleborn. Hermione or someone else. I just think he would never have the mindset of someone brought up in a magical household, and would want a home that was at least somewhat Muggle. Especially one in a Muggle neighborhood, to get away from the Wizard paparazzi.

  I'm really skeptical of this idea of yours that there's a way to "do it wrong" in Fanfiction.
#+end_quote

Bad fan fiction has to be conceived through a certain means. It combines using an OTP as a baseline in every fic, using your favourite character as a baseline in every fic, and incoherent plot and OOC decisions. This may be fanfiction but it still has to resemble the original work in order for it to be considered so.
