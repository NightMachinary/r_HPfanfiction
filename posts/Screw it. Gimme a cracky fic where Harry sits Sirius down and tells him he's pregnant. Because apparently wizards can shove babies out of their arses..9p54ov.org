** here's some real stuff to level up the crack: vaginal birth is important because babies get the bacteria for their skin flora on their way to the outside world. an ass baby would get a whole different set of bacteria. add magic to the mix and there could be some interesting effects later on. disgusting, yes, but also interesting.

  Harry: Sirius, sit down.

  Sirius: What is it, Prongslet.

  Harry: /You're/ pregnant.

  Sirius: Lolwut?

  Harry: And so is Moony. You're both the fathers.

Edit: Also, scientists tested it with monkeys. Apparently, surgically implanted embryos can attach to and draw nutrients from the abdominal wall in male monkeys. Of course, the baby also needs to be surgically removed because there's no exit that way. MPreg? Legit. Ass-babies? Nope.

**** I think it was because they were only testing if an embryo could have implanted in the muscle, and that it was removed/aborted immediately upon confirmating that an implantation was successful. They didn't let it grow at all, because seriously an embryo is one hell of a tumor.

My original post may have been a little exaggerated in tone. And also, in writing my reply to this, I went to try to find my original source and couldn't...

You know what? Don't take this with a grain of salt. Unscrew the salt shaker's lid and dump the whole damn thing on this post.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

  Harry has a twin, and everyone thinks it was Nick who survived. What will happen when Harry is pushed aside? Will he fight for a world that didn't want or care about him? Will Dumbledore or the Potter's grovel at his feet? What happens when the world finds out he was the one to survive that fateful Halloween night? Fourth year summer fling HP/VK! Primarily Snarry SS/HP! SLASH
