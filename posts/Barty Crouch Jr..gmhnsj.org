So I have a few stories where Barty Crouch Jr. is a great character. And I want more haha. He doesn't have to be the main character but a strong presences would be nice. I really like the ones where you see his devotion to his Lord. Dark stories are awesome, specifically if Harry goes dark or gray. I really want good Barty, Harry friendship or mentor-ship or even brother like relationship. I prefer slash stories though if they aren't thats okay


** It's not finished yet, but I think linkao3(20428298) fits. Barty Crouch Jr and Luna help Harry survive the Triwizard Tournament, and Barty convinces him to join Voldemort.

** The Well Groomed Mind linkao3(427653) has Barty as a central character. Harry takes private lessons from "Moody", and he figures out that "Moody" is a Death Eater rather earthly, but continues on to build a strong mentor/apprentice relationship.

I also recommend mad_fairy's series, both Ninja Wizard linkao3(10824855) and Mischief's Heir linkao3(4629198). Two different series but they have the same backstory for Barty: the Lestranges convince him they're Harry's legal guardians and he helps them find Harry with the best of intentions. The wards on Privet Drive summon the Aurors who assume Barty was their accomplice and a secret Death Eater. Both stories have him bonding with Sirius over being innocent in Azkaban.

#+begin_quote
  At the height of his power, Lord Voldemort employed another failsafe next to the horcruxes: his most loyal followers would be able to retrieve them and resurrect him with their help. As a result, Barty Crouch Jr. breaks his father's mind control early and goes off to seek his master.While he is unsuccessful in locating him, he manages to find surprising but welcome allies in the Boy-Who-Lived and his godfather. With the support of the Ancient and Noble House of Black on his side, Barty needs to use all his cunning and guile to navigate the world of politics and Dark Arts. And so, four years after their first meeting, a different Harry Potter will arrive at Hogwarts: one who wants nothing more than to bring Lord Voldemort back and who will stop at nothing to achieve his goal.

  A reflection on the relationship between four-year-old Harry and his doting guardian/minion, Barty Crouch Jr. We see a glimpse into the lives of the Petunia and Dudley without Harry around to abuse. Both Petunia and Barty Jr vociferously deny that their respective charges are the least bit spoiled. Part 7 of my Arrested Development series, in which young Harry, abused by the Dursleys, is magically transported to Azkaban. He winds up in Barty Jr's cell. Barty is convinced that the Dark Lord gifted him with Harry to raise as his Prince. Sirius just wants to raise his godson. An unlikely friendship, and an even more unlikely family, forms!
