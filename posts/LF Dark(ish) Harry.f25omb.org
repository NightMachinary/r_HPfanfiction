I have just finished reading Blood and Crest by Cauchy and I really liked his take on Harry.

He definitely learned some of the darker side of magic, but he isn't out right evil or Dark necessary (at least in my opinion).

I also like how Harry was quite competent (if not really good) at Charms, but still had the some struggles with learning the magic and can't just throw his had at anything and be Super! Harry.

Does anyone know of any similar stories - a good and competent Harry who isn't super powerful, but also one who dabbles in some of the darker side of magic and isn't a 100% for the light type Harry.

Thanks in advance.

  "I can't go back, can I?“ Harry asked after a while."Do you want to?“ Death asked instead of answering. Harry stayed quiet."I could choose to go on,“ he said after some time."You could,“ Death replied and paused for a moment. Then he started to talk again. “But there is something you want more than that, don't you?”“What do you mean?” Harry asked as he let his hands wander over the back of a bench."A second chance,“ Death said. Harry stopped and turned around to look at the being. “I cannot simply bring back the dead. But If you were my Master, I could bring you back to the dead." Twenty-four-year old Harry Potter feels like something is missing in his life. When Death offers him a second chance, he takes it.Accompanied by the being, Harry travels back to the summer before Sirius dies. Inside his younger body and the memories of an older self, Harry realizes, that being connected to Death may have twisted his morals a little more than expected.And while the Ministry could use a change; this time he won't let himself being used in this war. Neither by Dumbledore nor anyone else.

** Alaunatar: Stronger Than Hope [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3389525/1/]]\\
Warning: the story has a strong theme of suicidal thinking and an attempt. Harry trains in Occlumency and Legilimency with Snape as his mentor eventually. Snape is not nice. Legilimency is very dark and there's plenty of talk on morality and what is the sacrifice that's worth it to defeat Voldemort.
