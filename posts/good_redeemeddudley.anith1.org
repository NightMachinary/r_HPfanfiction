Any good fics where dudley and harry become friends or dudley sticks up for harry. Maybe they reconnect sometime after the war. I'm fine with one shots, but i'd prefer something longer?


** Not near enough of stuff like this in my opinion. Only things come to mind: the one shot Cousin Harry linkffn(11923249) and Dudley's Memories linkffn(6142629) which starts of with exactly this fix, but Dudley(and co.) play a disappointingly small role in the fic overall.

I'd also recommend linkffn(11577120) which kind of scratches a somewhat similar itch?

** Linkffn(4172226) has Dudley rising to the occasion when Vernon goes too far. It's well-received and quite well-written.

I'd also recommend Linkffn(8369495). It's not quite as dramatic as "A Hero" but I find it to be closer in tone to the original stories, and I prefer it.

Edit: Oh bugger. I posted Ravenclaw Cutie again by mistake. That was from an earlier thread. Sorry. Fixed.

** I cannot for the life of me remember enough unique details to find it, but there was a really well written one where Dudley realized what his parents actually did and eventually went into child psychology and worked with the police as sort of emergency child services in the hopes of finding "funny" cases so he could find the magical world and reconnect with Harry... ultimately to find out that his longtime co-worker and counterpart with social services is actually Hermione who's job it was to cover up magical involvement and protect/whisk away magical children stuck in extreme situations.

Dudley married and goes by his spouse's last name, but wrote a book under Dursley (in hopes harry might find it) about how the "Other" child who is not abused is still fucked up by being in an abusive household, just in different ways.

Hopefully someone else will remember enough to find it?

as well as linkffn(The First Year, an Almost Happily Ever After story)

i last read these like 10 yrs ago when i first discovered fanfics but iirc they were both decent quality

linkffn(The Burn of the Phoenix) is pretty good but unfortunately a oneshot

  Harry Potter spent his eleventh birthday in a cabin on a tiny rock in the middle of the sea, listening to his cousin snore on the couch.When a knock sounded on the wind-swept, rain-drenched door, it was not a giant fist (or a half-giant's fist). It was a short sharp rap that sounded once, twice, three times before Minerva McGonagall simply charmed the lock open and stepped inside. "Apologies," Minerva said crisply, as Vernon raced out brandishing his rifle and Petunia pulled Dudley up off the couch and behind her. "I wasn't sure you could hear me over the weather.” The rain fell down behind the professor in a roar. She was perfectly dry.Minerva fished in her pocket without looking, because the only things allowed in her pockets were only ever exactly what she needed. “I've come to deliver this," she said, pulling out a letter and handing it to Harry, who was cross-legged on the floor, "because our owl post seems to have been unable to get through.”“And I've come to deliver this," she added, pulling out a second letter, "because Hogwarts by-laws require a professor to hand-deliver acceptance letters to Muggleborn families for their explanation and comfort."

** I think little0birds Questions and Answers has some of this (been a while since I read it). The fic is /not/ about Harry and Dudley reconnecting, but they interact enough that it's probably worth mentioning. Linkffn(Questions and Answers). Also, they don't reconnect at the start of the fic, IIRC. It will be partway into the story, and that fic is much too long for me to comb through to find where they first meet up (unfortunately).
