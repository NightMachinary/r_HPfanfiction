I've read linkffn(Holly Evans and the Spiral Path) already, and probably a few others.

  He was only twelve, going on thirteen. And shouldn't Madame Pomfrey been able to detect this and stop it while he'd been in the hospital wing? Because seriously? This? This thing right here? It had to have been something to do with the Basilisk having bitten him. A whole new spin on the Snake!Harry Genre with some Ancestor! thrown in.

** I remember a good one where Harry ends up with a stripe of red hair down the middle of his head, and ends up moving to Knockturn Alley. Living in an inn where he works at the Bookshop that's attached to it, but I cannot find it anywhere. He also falls in love with a drow I think.

Edit: Found it, it's linkffn(Serpens Armarum) and unfortunately looks like it's been deleted.

Edit pt. 2: Found it on fiction hunt

** linkffn(9704180)

The consequences of having powerful venom and phoenix tears in his blood, plus being exposed to soul magic via the Horcrux has consequences in this story. It doesn't depend on the venom being from a basilisk though, the story notes other examples using other types of venom.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

#+begin_quote
  Two years after being impaled by the Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets, Harry starts noticing some...odd changes. During eighth year he can no longer pretend, and has to deal with what he's become. In order to do that, he has to get help from someone less-than-ideal. Over the years, Harry and Snape's relationship grows; now with an alternative Snarry ending. Rating to be safe.
