If you were writing a HP fic whilst students are at school would you write it in the style of an English school and use traditional English words? I.e use 'term' instead of 'semester', 'sweets' instead of 'candy' type of thing. As a writer do you find these things important?

I've read quite a few fics and I don't know personally I prefer to read ones that are properly based in England using the proper words, and find it funny to read the words people thing we use all the times that we don't.

Just curious haha!


** English isn't my native language, so I'm not completely familiar with all the differences, but I try to write everything in British English, both in spelling and the use of English terms.

** Honestly I think it's up to you. If you feel it's easier to keep it with "American" English with chips and fries and soda, go for it. If you feel like "England" English with crisps and mate then do that. Your the writer so do what you can :) If you really just want an opinion and your fine either way, I think fans of HP prefer the proper usage as used in canon but again, whatever floats your boat

** I tend to use American English for narration (just because it's easier and more natural, and I feel that it's awkwarder to mess up on Britishisms than it is to just not use them), but in dialogue I try to keep it as British as possible.

** I think it all depends on the author and their dedication. If they truly want to write a fic using traditional English words but is not a native themselves then that's sort of something they should keep an eye out for when writing and if they want to look up further words that they aren't familiar with but native English speakers use daily.

But if the author isn't a native English speaker and knows that they won't be able to keep up the British slang when writing then they should write the way they know from the start. Consistency is key in my opinion.

*** Yeah I see what you mean. I dunno I just find that when I'm reading a fic and they don't use the proper British words, or over use British words (reading one atm and apparently the only other word for sex is 'shagging' and its used all the time with teenagers.. Not true at all) it kind of annoys me only because I think if I was to read an actual book I'd expect the author to use the proper terms for the location of where they're story is.

Hope that makes sense, I tend to write how I talk and babble a bit.. Sorry!

** It's kind of a double-edged sword for writers (like me) who aren't from the U.K., when you think about it. Either the writers don't make the effort to use the proper words, and it sounds off, or the writers try and they get it wrong, and it sounds off.

It makes sense that, if a reader is from the area where the story is set, that reader going to favor writers who actually know the area rather than writers who don't.
