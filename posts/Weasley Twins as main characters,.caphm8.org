Anything out there that focuses on the Weasey Twins and their interactions with the students who are in their year, two or three years older than the twins, even if the Trio are background characters.

Added interest the author monkeys about a bit - for example sorting one or both elsewhere - but absolutely keeps them in character. No Death Eater Twins please,

**** Thanks! With a name like Madeline_Basset, you might like my other story, In the Bleak Midwinter, even more. I've been told it's Wodehouse-like in style, although it's not an actual crossover.

** In linkao3(14281440;14367483;15287883) they are a way more central to the story, because the main couple is Hermione/George.

  Part 3 of The Arithmancer Series. Hermione won the war, but her career as the world's greatest arithmancer is just beginning. Now, she has places to go, spells to invent, and a family to start. Oh, and a whole lot of dementors to kill.
