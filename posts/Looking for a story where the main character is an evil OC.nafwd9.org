I don't care if it has slash or not but I was wondering if there were any good ones.


** Linkffn(I Am Lord Voldemort) Fully amoral protagonist who lies, cheats, kills and tortures his way through the setting. For reference, he experiments with the Horcrux ritual by torturing prisoners into making one. He even finds ways to defile a Phoenix.

#+begin_quote
  A genre savvy but ignorant of canon OC insert into Voldemort right after the murder of James Potter. Greed replacing pride at the helm of a terrorist group just might change the course of history. After all, the magical world is full of potential waiting to be exploited. (Inspired by The Evil Overlord List and 48 Laws of Power.)

Dude got reincarnated with gamer abilities into HP verse and he doesn't get out of his way to be a dick but does whatever is necessary to get what he wants.
