** "You abandoned your own son?!" Lily questioned furiously. "We died for him!"

The other Lily shrugged. "Why would I want that stupid squib? He's worthless compared to John."

Dumbledore's eyes widened as he saw Lily beating up her doppelgänger. "No, Lily, stop it! Get off her! /Relashio/!"

OoOoO

Dumbledore stroked his beard thoughtfully as he eyed his clone. "So you corrupted a boy named Tom Riddle so you would look like a hero and blocked 99.9% of Harry's core?"

The manipulative Dumbledore nodded quickly. "Yes, it was all very fun! I wish I could tell you all of my exploits! Love potioning him, hiding his lordships from him, and even stealing most of his money!"

Dumbledore sighed. "At least I feel much better about myself now."

OoOoO

"You should have died for them like I would!" Sirius shouted as he kept on punching his other self. "You-you coward!"

The evil Sirius was confused. "Weren't you just laughing about how you planned to kill a classmate?! Even I didn't do that in school!"

OoOoO

Severus sneered as he looked at his smiling clone. "What are you smiling for, you idiot?!"

"Why shouldn't I! Everything is going well for me really!" the clone beamed at Severus. "Beautiful wife, healthy kids, and a perfect job teaching bright young minds!"

Snape fainted.

OoOoO

Ron's clone eyed the Weasleys suspiciously. "Is this an ambush?! Are you Order members?! Because I know you guys went to the Death Eater gathering already! This won't fool me!"

Fred snickered. "So, Ron, when were you going to tell us you were a Death Eater!"

Ron glared at him. "Hey, in that universe, you guys are Death Eaters too, if we believe what he says!"

OoOoO

Harry frowned as he saw his alternate self. "Why are you naked on all fours and begging to be knotted?"

His alternate self ignored him, his eyes landing on Sirius. "Alpha! Knot me! Put your thick, juicy-"

Hermione turned green. "Stop talking!"

** Harry and the other from his universe cautiously entered the next room they were all worried at what might be next that is till they heard a explosion. "Sireously will you two stop testing weapons I'm trying to read" What sounded like another Harry stated and as they saw what was in the room everyone paused as several Harry's walked around the room talking to each other one of which holding a rocket launcher was arguing with another who was holding a book.

** I have to write this at a later date

​

.oOo.

Dumbledore looked at his counterpart, who was talking about how indignant he was that he hadn't used Harry. After all, there were so many different ways to manipulate the naive brat.

Honestly, Albus was still trying to process how he could become someone so heartless. Especially to spoil Tom Riddle? He did exactly the opposite. Use the Potter child? God, he loved him like a son. It made his conscience hardly hold out, although he knew he was doing well. Besides, meeting this Dumbledore allowed him to relieve a little. But when he heard about forcing him to be loyal to him, giving him potions to make him love Ginny Weasley was too much for him.

- What the fuck are you thinking? - he yelled in the face of the speechless old man. - Forcing someone to LOVE ?! YOU MORON...

It ended up with the other Dumbledore's having to pull the canon! Dumbledore away from the Manipulative! Dumbledore, because it would have ended in murder and changed universes.

.oOo.

Lily Potter was currently trying to calm down. She was staring at the front woman, so soulless, heartless, and in general, it couldn't be called her. All she wanted to do now was find that poor boy Harry from their universe, hug him, and make sure that Lily was tormented. For now, however, she had been listening to the argument between Lily who had lost Harry while fighting Voldemort and Lily whose son had been raised by the Dark Lord, who were rightly screaming at the bitch.

Hearing how they threatened her with the Cruciatus curse, she was ready to join them.

The woman's pathetic excuses were like music to her ears. She really didn't want anything more than hurt her. Anyway, now that she thought about it, who was standing in her way? There was no James or Sirius or Dumbledore so she was all hers and the few other women in that room, but that's a detail. I mean, there were these other idiots trying to help her, whether it was because they thought Harry was evil or some other kind of bullshit. In any case, they could handle them.

She stood up with a disturbing smile and sparkling eyes. She pulled out her wand and thought about what she wanted to do first.

.oOo.

Sirius tolerated his counterparts quite well. Of course, he had already dealt with the traitor of his friends, ended up broken with both legs, two teeth knocked out, a concussion and a cracked chest. Now he could have a pleasant conversation with Sirius who raised Harry, and Sirius who was deadly handsome and raised Harry as well.

.oOo.

If Harry were to be honest, he would never have thought that he would have been invited to tea by Tom Riddle, who was smiling and clearly mental, and certainly that he would also invite Dumbledore and (here he began to seriously consider the mental health issue) Severus Snape.

However, once he knocked on room number 7 (began to wonder if this was a joke on the part of the good Dark Lord) and sat back, he couldn't help but notice that the place was really cozy. The green walls, white curtains, a few ancient looking appliances, a green carpet again, a couch covered with a gray blanket in a reindeer pattern, and finally a Christmas tree in the corner of the room were really nice to look at. He couldn't help but wonder what happened to their Tom.

He had almost forgotten that twenty-four-year-old Voldemort was standing leaning on the doorframe, watching him with grinning teeth, and he came to sit on a beautiful green-upholstered chair. Is everything /green/ here? he asked himself mentally, but it was interrupted by the doorbell, which the brunet in the kitchen opened with wandless magic.

- Make yourself at home! - heard him scream - I will come to you soon.

The man looked around the small apartment with hidden admiration. Severus could not imagine his serpentine master in such a decorated room. Or even imagine him as an ordinary person. And also one with empathy. Albus Dumbledore had those annoying glittering eyes in place as always. But now they looked more natural. He sat down comfortably in the armchair that sat on the other side of the patterned table.

They waited in silence for a moment until the young man brought tea with milk and cookies and took his seat himself.

`` It's ... '' he began swaying. "I met that one of yours ... what was his name? Voldimort? No, I guess it was ..."

"Voldemort," Harry put in helpfully, and Tom gave him a grateful look.

- It was he ... Can someone finally tell me what is wrong with my counterpart?! - he said calmly, but it was obvious that he was agitated. - He was killing children! He murdered effortlessly and still laughed. This ... it can't even be called bestiality!

Dumbledore looked at him grimly from under his half glasses.

- Forgive me, Tom, but I don't know when it happened. We suspect that when he turned sixteen and created the Horcrux ...

As Riddle heard the word Horcrux, his cup fell from his hands. He looked shocked, turned terribly pale and focused his incredulous eyes on the old man.

- WHAT HE DID?!

*** .oOo.

Harry honestly had no intention of being in the room of his other versions after meeting Tom. But as he stood in the middle of the arguing five Harry Potter, one with an even more fucked up childhood than he was, he felt even worse than a few minutes before. There were two super Slytherin Potters in the corner of the room who watched it with a mocking smile on their face, there were four mentally tired Boy-Who-Lived by the door, and nearly twenty pathetically annoying scarred men who were making Canon! Harry could feel bile rising in his throat. And to think he might have acted like that.

When he almost had a nervous breakdown due to being pulled all over the place and curious younger or older Harry's who were genuinely curious about how he was living, his savior appeared. Another Harry in Slytherin, but that didn't bother him. The boy pulled him out of the circle of the curious club and quite rudely announced that he was now his and that they could piss off, took him to the cafeteria.

He looked gratefully at his companion and took his seat. He looked around quickly and noticed that there were a few Ron's and Hermione's and probably some giggling Lavender Brown and her severely irritated version. He shook his head and looked at his counterpart in the other universe and smiled.

"Thanks, I thought I was going to die there. Seriously, just a few more minutes and I'd have to crank up." He said, at which the black-haired smirked.

"Someone would have thought the Golden Boy was used to the spotlight." He replied lightly, but there was a hint of bitterness in his tone. If Harry didn't know himself that well, he wouldn't have known the difference. He also knew he wouldn't want mercy, so he quickly changed the subject.

"So .... You like Quidditch?" he asked after some thought.

"W-What? ... Er, I guess ... I usually play the seeker." He said clearly confused. The young man on the other side of the table, on the other hand, smiled inwardly.

"Me too, what's your record for snitch catching time?

They spent an hour talking about Hogwarts, his differences, the Quiddich, politics, and most importantly, Voldemort and his band of flatterers. Harry involuntarily felt relieved that this particular Slytherin Harry had never joined him.

"You know, they say he used to be sane. But sorry, I don't believe it. Nobody in their right mind would create a Horcrux for one. Second, I find it strange that he was chasing children in the first place after hearing the prophecy. Seriously?"

"I totally agree." Canon muttered, "No offense, of course, Tom." He muttered to a man who passed by, who nodded his apology.

"True words never spoken." They heard a scream at which they both laughed.

And then Harry wanted to bring up a topic that annoyed him. He had heard that James and Lily from another universe had another son who became the Chosen One, and that Harry was given to the Dursleys. He needed confirmation.

He cleared his throat and prepared to speak. "I heard that this ... How did he get? Conrad? No ... Connor! Yes, Connor, is the Boy Who Lived at yours." he said casually, but saw the other tense. "Honestly, I always found these titles funny. For me," Harry Potter, the boy his mother saved while he sniffed" It would be more fitting."

A reluctant snort sounded to his right.

"And overall, I was wondering if he was as annoying as they say."

" Yes, he is."

Harry chuckled at the reply.

"And there is also the matter of his parents. "The boy couldn't bring himself to call them parents the Slytherin next to him." They say they are mean. If that's the case, then I need your permission to hurt them pretty badly. Very much."

Hammer stiffened but said nothing. So he continued.

"And as the only member of the family in question, and the future heir, I must obtain such permission from you. "He muttered softly before grabbing his arm." Did they hurt you directly or indirectly? "He asked seriously, dropping his light tone.

For a moment nothing happened, even the buzz seemed to subside and the fire in the fireplace stopped. A feeling of tension filled the air. Green eyes, green eyes did not leave ...

Before he finally nodded.

The elder's eyes sparkled in ways that promised bloody revenge.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, maybe I did Harry some OOC, but really in my imagination after the Deathly Hallows, he had no resistance to taking revenge or whatever. Note that Harry was very protective of his family and children who, like him, grew up in a difficult environment. I think this case could have been considered both.

*** It's basically the concept of a hierarchy in second gender. The levels are Alpha, the one that's supposed to be in charge. Beta, the one that isn't in charge but isn't a pushover. And Omega. In some fiction the omega is the lowest of the low socially, often being raped for breeding purposes. In other fictions the omega is a highly prized and rare partner that can bare children even if the couple is the same gender.
