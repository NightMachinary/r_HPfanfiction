** There's a difference between being able to act calmly and confidently 'in the moment'/in the face of direct danger, and the build-up/pressure of knowing you're expected to perform well at some point in the future

While most of us haven't faced down a mountain troll, I think we can nearly all relate to the feeling of anxiety before a big exam or performance, and I don't think being worried about a big Quidditch match (his first, too!) means that he can't be brave/bold/confident in other situations

*** That and when he played his first match, he was in front of the whole school. In the others instances, he was just with Harry and Hermione. Social pressure is a thing that can really eat you.

*** I think he would have played better at first if someone else broke their leg and he had to fill in last second. Ron's on top when there's no time to think.

** These are different types of bravery. I can perform in front of crowds, but would I fight a troll etc? Hell no. Ron is the opposite. It makes perfect sense to me.

** All the more reason why I love Ron. Confronting a mass murderer? Nothing compared to Quidditch.
