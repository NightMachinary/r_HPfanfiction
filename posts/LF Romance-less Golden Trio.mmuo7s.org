I've always loved the interactions between the golden trio in canon and fanon alike, so I've been looking to read fics that focus on the dynamics between those three in general. However, I don't want one where any of the three are romantically involved with any of the others, just looking for them being really close friends. I don't mind any of them having romance with other characters, in fact I actually would probably prefer it if it's well done. Any genre works, would just prefer avoiding anything overly angst-y


** The best one imo has to be The Sum of Our Parts. It's a dark lord ! Harry where Ron and Hermione stick by him no matter what. There's no romance.

(honey) there is no right way is a groundhog day AU but I love the golden trio friendship in it. It's not the main point though

There's also a great trio friendship in the Methods of Humanity series. The first work doesn't feature the trio but the second does. Again, the main focus is something else, but Ron and Hermione back Harry up and you can tell they're close friends.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  ‘Have you tried everything?' Hermione asked insistently.‘Yes! Every time I get to the cup and Cedric doesn't take it with me I go immediately back to my bed in the morning. But all the times he is with me, he dies and after I fall asleep I return too.'‘I guess it is obvious then, isn't it?' Both Harry and Hermione turned to stare at Ron, who looked at them defensively and shrugged ‘You have to go with Diggory and make sure he survives.'Harry/Cedric - Groundhog day AU

  Tom Riddle was never taught how to understand children. Learning from scratch didn't seem proper, but it seems to be working so far.
