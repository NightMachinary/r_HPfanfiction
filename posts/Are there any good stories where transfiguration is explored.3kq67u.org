I always thought that transfiguration would be the most interesting subject and I was just interested to see if anyone had written a fic where it was fleshed out a bit.


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Golden Needle by xenocidender) is pretty good and goes into depth about transfiguration.

  Harry has an idea of how to break the rules of Transfiguration, and it actually might work. Maybe. Plenty of other things happen too. No slash and no pairings as yet.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** linkffn(The Lie I've Lived by Jbern) has the main character use a lot of transfiguration in duels, and also to solve tasks in the (modified) triwizard tournament. I don't think the mechanics are fleshed out completely, but there's definitely more there than in canon.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

** Alexandra Potter by Taure goes into considerable depth on this subject, including sections of a chapter the author has written expounding what he thinks the canonical theory of transfiguration is.

  First year fem!Harry AU. Alexandra Potter has finally come to Hogwarts, where she will meet new friends and discover a world of magic. But will an escalating rivalry threaten all that she's built? Character-driven story, lots of world building. No canon rehash, no bashing.
