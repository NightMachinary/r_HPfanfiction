:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I don't remember much but I do remember Harry ran away and wanted to go travel the world when he was 15/16. Tom and Harry stayed at some fancy hotel for a bit before parting ways which made them really upset. I think Narcissa Malfoy became Tom's advisor which made Lucius upset.

There was also this one specific scene that I remember where Tom was eating with the Malfoys and Harry gifted him a quill that was sentimental for him. Lucius thought it must be something expensive and exotic, Narcissa knew what it meant and I think Draco insulted it, causing Tom to get mad.

It was an ao3 fic, I think.
