Sirius ﻿Black was taken aback when he met an unknown cousin named Jack. He didn't know who Jack was, but he knew that he had a sister.

“I don't know what you're talking about,” said Jack, looking startled.

“ We don't know you,” said Harry. “We don't know who you are.”

“We don't know you either,” said Jack in astonishment. “ We're your cousins, aren't we?”

“Yeah,” said Harry.

“We don't know anything about you, either,” said Jack. “You 're not in our family.”

“Well, I'm not in yours,” said Harry. “I can't be your cousin.”

“Well, I'm not either,” said Jack. “I can't be your brother, either.”

“I'm not either,” said Harry.

“I can't be your uncle, your step-uncle, or your half-uncle.”

“Well, you're not my uncle,” said Harry again. “I'll never be your uncle, and you'll never be my dad.”

“Don't be silly, of course,” said Jack, “you are my dad.”

“You can't be my dad, then,” said Harry. “Dad's got a sister.”

“Oh, come on, man!” said Jack in disbelief. “You're the son of a witch!”

“ I'm your father,” Harry repeated. “I've got a sister too.”

“You're not related to her by blood, then?” jeered Jack. “You 're not even related to her sister, you are related to me, because I'm my dad's son.”

“I'm not related to you, I'm related to Dad!” said Harry furiously. “You're trying to make me a dad!”

“I'm trying to make you a normal dad, Harry,” said Hermione. “I'll be your dad from now on.”

“I'll be your dad too,” Harry repeated. “I'll be like Dad, I'll be there to look after you.”

�

The next day Harry, Ron, and Hermione went down to breakfast, where the Gryffindor table was already packed with parents of students already present. Harry, who had never before seen so many people, found it very difficult to sit down. Hermione was sitting right behind him, her face set and expressionless. Harry noticed that she was holding a rather large piece of toast.

“What's up, Mom?” he asked her.

She looked at him in surprise and said, “I've been up all day with Dad, trying to find out what's going on.”

“What are you doing?”

“I'm trying to find out what the hell is going on.”

“Me too."

"Me neither,” she said, and she left.

Harry sat down and tried to read his mind. He was thinking about the way he felt about his parents. He had never been more proud of them, and he was sure he had never felt so sorry for himself. He was sitting there, in the middle of the Gryffindor common room, and he had never had a better feeling about him. He had never felt so proud of anything in his life. He had never felt so happy. He was sitting here, and he was going to tell Ron and Hermione that he was sorry he had come to see them, and that he wished he had just told them. He was going to tell them that he was sorry they had to go through what they had had to go through, and that he would never forgive them. He was going to tell them that he was proud of them, that he was proud of them, he was going to tell them that he loved them, he was going to tell them that he loved them so much that he could have killed them himself. Harry's heart was pounding more strongly than it had in months. He was going to tell them, he was going to tell them, he was going to tell them, he was going to tell them....

"I love you, Harry."

*** Yes it is. There's a text box that you can let the bot fill out, or you can type a word, a phrase or a sentence into it. From there, the bot generates various "choices" you can pick from. It's all up to you what to choose and up to what length. I stopped when the sentences the bot was giving me were getting repetitive.

** "I ﻿like anime. Magic's much cooler there. I wish we had magic like that," said Lupin, who was now holding a large bottle of pink liquid.

"I've been trying to find a way to make it work. But I don't think I've found it yet. I think I'll just have to wait until I've got a better understanding of how magic works, shall I?" asked Lily.

"You wait," said Lupin coldly, and he took a swig of liquid from his bottle and turned to leave.

"You drank it! You drank the potion! I didn't think you were going to drink it, you know it's poison!" said Hermione, who, it transpired, was sitting at a table across the room.

"You're just being a bit overbearing, Hermione," Lily sighed. "I think you know the potion's best left to the witches who've had a proper go at it. I've tried very hard. I think you're a bit too harsh."

"I've had a go at it!" Hermione exclaimed looking horrified. "I'm not harsh!"

"I think you're being a bit harsh, Hermione," said Lupin, his eyes on the door. "You've had a go at the Potters, you know. You've been rude and nasty, and you've been a bit harsh."

"I'm not being rude and nasty!" Hermione said, and her voice was suddenly much higher than usual. "I'm not trying to be rude or anything!"

"Well, then," said Lupin, "I don't want to argue with you, Hermione, and I'm not being rude or anything if I don't have to, so let's just say it's going a bit downhill from here." He and Hermione exchanged a look.

"I don't want to know where this is heading," Lily sighed, and she and Lupin turned to walk out of the classroom, and Hermione, who was still sitting with her head in her hands, looked around.

"I don't think we're going to be going anywhere," Hermione muttered to herself.

--------------

Hermione ﻿wanted to get along with the Potters but the Potters were not to be trusted. They had been plotting to kill Crookshanks for ages.

“But he's been dead for ages!” said Harry.

“He didn't die in the fire,” said Hermione. “The Potters..."

“What﻿ are you talking about?” said Harry. “Crookshanks is a mean little rat, Hermione.”

Hermione looked at him in surprise. “He's a cat, not a rat.”

“This is important,” said Harry. “Crookshanks was supposed to die, and you know it, I saw it happen. And you didn't stop them, and I've got proof.”

Hermione's eyes glazed over. "I'm sorry,” said Hermione, but her voice was very deep. “I just ---”

“Hermione!" Harry called, panicked I'm going to tell Mum and Dad,” he added hastily.

--------------

They were back in the kitchen, where Harry made to take the kettle of boiling water out for Lily and Lupin's tea

"What happened?” mouthed Lily at Harry, but he just shook his head.

“You know,” Hermione added, looking up at him, “Crookshanks died when it was a matter of time. I saw him coming back up the chimney, and I jumped in the kettle and I was right beside him.”

“Yes, I saw him come back up the chimney,” said Harry, trying to look as though he knew exactly what she'd just seen. “And he was right beside Hermione."

“And when he's dead,” said Hermione, “I'll be able to have him as a pet.”

Lily's eyes widened. “I don't know what you're talking about,” she said, “I've never killed anyone.”

Hermione looked at her. Her heart was pounding very fast. “I'll be able to have him as a pet,” she told her. “I'll be able to have him around me.”

Lily looked shocked. "It's getting worse! I don't believe it!"

"It's not getting any worse, she's just being stupid," said Harry, looking exasperated. "I'm not even going to tell you how uch I'm worried, all right?" facing Hermione again.

"Then don't. I know," said Hermione, looking aghast. "You've been worried about me for ages. I don't think I can stand it any longer."

"Look, I'm not complaining," said Harry. "I'm not complaining because you're going to be brilliant at everything you do, and I'm not complaining because you're going to have loads of fun. I'm just worried that you're going to be a bit... a bit... stupid."

"Well, I'm not a bit stupid!" said Hermione, her eyes on Harry. "I'm a bit like you, aren't I?"

"Yeah, I know," said Harry, "but I'm not a bit like you, either."

Hermione looked as though she had swallowed a lot of food in one sitting. Harry, who had been looking around for a reason to be angry with her, was not sure what to say. But he had to admit that she had always been a bit... off.

Lupin pinched the bridge of his nose, his eyes flashing. “It's not a good sign,” he said darkly. You have to give her time, Harry, to sort out their problems." �

** You could be great, Harry Potter. Join me. Together, we can be great.” “Great?” repeated Ron, looking shocked and slightly frightened. “I don't think so. ...” “I think we're going to have to do something a little

more complicated than that,” said Hermione, “because we've got to get you out of here.” “What?” said Harry. “Where are we going?” “ Out of the fire,” said Ron. “You're the only one who can get us out.” “But I can't --- I can't go inside the castle, I'

m supposed to be in the Forbidden Forest, I can't do anything ---” “You can do anything if you're in the Forbidden Forest, Hermione, you need to concentrate, you can't do anything for ages and ages and ages, you need to do something, you need to do something.” “But I can't, I'm supposed to be in the library, I can't ---� “You can do anything if you're in the library, Hermione, you need to concentrate, you can do it, you're the only one who can't do it, you're the only one who's stuck in the middle of a forest, you've got to use your wits, you've got to find a way out, you've got to,” said Harry, who was trying to sound cheerful and cheerful. “I'm going to go and see Ron.” Ron looked up at Harry as though he had never seen him before. “Harry,” he said, looking at Harry in the same kind of confused awe that Harry had seen him looking at the snake, “I've never even seen a snake.” “That's okay,” said Harry, “I� m going to go and see Ron.” And he set off, determined to see Ron again. Chapter 13 The Three Broomsticks Harry and Ron walked into the small kitchen, which was very much like the living room from the movie The Three Broomsticks. It had been renovated this year, with a new rug and a new carpet. There were also several new pictures on the walls, all of which were of Harry and Ron, with the caption, “Harry Potter and the Three Broomsticks.” Harry couldn't help noticing that the walls were covered with large, brightly colored photographs of Ron. He was wearing a brand-new pair of black tennis shoes with matching socks, and was holding a brand-new, gold-plated silver frying pan. “I haven't had time to get these,” said Ron, “but I'll have to get them now.” The frying pan was now sitting on top of the fireplace mantelpiece. Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the room together, Ron taking the back seat, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the car in the parking space beside the fireplace. “I'll take the back seat,” said Harry. “Ron, where's Hermione?” “Both of you get in the back,” said Ron. “I'll park in the lot behind the shop.” Harry, Ron, and Hermione drove up to the lot, which was a few hundred feet above the Muggle street. They parked in a small lot just off the main road, and then they walked around to the right of the sign that read Muggle Road and Half-Blood Prince's. They walked a short way up the road, and then, just as they were about to turn right, a sign on the side of a nearby building said “MORPHEUS GRIMLOCKS OUTSIDE.” The sign was in Greek, and Harry could not understand it. “I'm sorry,” he said, and he led the way up the stairs. They walked for a while in silence, and Harry wondered whether he was being watched. When at last they reached the bottom of the stairs, they were met by a large sign that read “MORPHEUS GRIMLOCKS OUTSIDE.” “What's that supposed to mean?” said Harry. “That's a warning,� said Hermione, who was looking rather nervous. “You don't want to get lost in there.” “We do,” said Harry, and with a great effort he managed to convince himself that he was still walking, “and Morpheus Grimlock's out. ...” “I hope you get your memories back before you spend too long in there,” said Hermione, “because I'm afraid you won't be able to go back to Hogwarts.” “But I'm not sure I want to!” said Harry. “You'll have to ask your parents,� said Hermione. “They might not like it, but you'll be able to come back to Hogwarts ---” “But you won't be able to go back to the movies!” said Harry. � I want to go to the movies!” “Well, Harry, it's not that simple, is it? You won't be able to go back to the movies with your parents?” “ I --- I'm sure I will,” said Harry, relieved. “But I don't want to go to the movies with my sister, my sister is really bad at magic, she's not good at all.” “Why not?” asked Hermione, who had been listening closely. “I don't mind if you don't like me,” said Harry. “I don 't mind at all.” “But you're not allowed to have a girlfriend!” said Hermione in a muffled voice. “Well, yeah, but I'm not allowed to have a girlfriend who's not me!” said Harry furiously. “I'm supposed to have a girlfriend who can defeat dementors, and I'm not supposed to have a girlfriend who's not me. And if you go and have a girlfriend who's not me, I'm not supposed to have a girlfriend either!” “You're supposed to have a girlfriend who's not me!” said Harry again. “You're supposed to have a girlfriend who's got the Dark Mark on her chest, and I'm not supposed to have a girlfriend who's got the Dark Mark on her chest!” “I'm not a girl!” said Hermione in a low, cold voice. “I'm not a girl!” “I'm not a girl!” said Hermione again. “I'm a girl!” Hermione was sobbing into a tissue. Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, stunned. “Hermione,� they said together, “we're supposed to have the Dark Mark on our chest, we're supposed to be friends with the Dark Lord's favorite, we're supposed to be working together to do his dirty work ---” “What d'you mean, our favorite?” said Ron. “Hermione, you know the Dark Mark, you know where it is, you know who the guy who made it is!” Ron cried. “We're supposed to be his Death Eaters!” “It doesn't matter!” said Ron. “The point is, we're with the Dark Lord, we're his Death Eaters, and I don't care what we do, you can't put the Dark Mark on me or Hermione or anyone else, and I won't use magic to do it!” “I don't think there's anything magic can do,” said Hermione. “It's not like the Eye of Slughorn, or the sword of Gry ffindor, or the sword of Hufflepuff, or the sword of Ravenclaw, or the sword of Slytherin ---” “Don't say the name of your favorite team, Hermione,” said Ron sharply. “It's a curse, and it's not very fun to break.” Hermione made a sudden note on her clipboard. “I don't think I could do it justice,” she said, looking up the definition of the term in the dictionary. “I mean, I could try and do it right, but I'd lose the flair. ... I'd have to say it in all caps, and it would look a bit like this: Curse that is not named in the preceding sentence. ...” She looked at Ron. “I don't think I could do it better, Ron
