From a different comment on here, made me interested in any stories where Harry ends up helping and maybe protecting abused kids. So any stories that has that would be neat.

I'd rather not have Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione, but if the story is good enough I'll accept it.

No Dumbledore or Weasley Bashing

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Crossovers are fine, I might not be able to read them, but someone else might be interested.


** This isn't exactly helping abused kids but more domestic abuse in general. Harry's an Auror who helps with domestic abuse and is good with kids from those situations. It has a little Ron and Hermione bashing but they feel genuine regret at the end and get better.

** linkao3(1535306) This one is a time travel where Harry goes into the past and adopts every magical orphan, squib and I'm pretty sure he found some kids with creature blood as well. Not sure if that's what you're looking for, but I'll link it anyway since I like it a lot.
