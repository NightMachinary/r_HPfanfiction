Reading fanfics, I've seen Harry inherit anything from a modest sum to literally the world's largest single fortune.

I generally think that the Potters were upper middle class and left Harry something like $500,000 worth of Galleons. A lot of money, but he's still going to need to work for a living.

I mostly /prefer/ that Harry has inherited a lot more than that, something like tens of millions in Galleons. He is solidly very wealthy, but nothing approaching one of the richest people on the planet. He's significantly below the Malfoys.

Thoughts?


** I assume that the Malfoys are significantly below the richer muggles since the wizard economy is tiny compared to the muggle one. Which means that while Harry is well-off in Wizarding Britain, he's not that well-off in Britain and certainly can't buy out entire stores on a whim. (I also assume that Galleons aren't freely convertible).

For Harry, my assumptions vary with a story's needs. In one he inherited enough gold to cover his tuition and another's, with a little left over. In another, he was more wealthy.

*** According to that ridiculous exchange rate of 5, yes, they were not wealthy in Muggle world.

But my take is that one Galleon was the exact equivalent of one ounce of real gold, which was worth 200 GBP in the 90s and 1000 GBP today.

Goblins were fleecing the wizards.

******** New headcanon:

One of the things that strengthened anti-muggleborn prejudice was a muggleborn who actually pulled this off in the late 1800s (playing off the the fall of the price of Silver (He melted down Galleons, traded them for cheaper silver and sold them back to the Goblins to be minted into Sickles (due to a number of quirks of laws including the SOS, the Wizard economy is almost entirely decoupled from the Muggle one, and the money exchange provided by Gringotts is/was hardcoded into Goblin/Human treaties or something), which helped to trigger and exacerbate the Panic of 1873 and the Long Depression.

The Goblin response to this (War), coupled with money supply issues with regard to defaults on magically enforced contracts (that demanded payment specifically in Galleons of which there was an insufficient supply) so damaged the British Wizarding community (and many others) that antimundane factions became wildly popular, thus helping set the scene for the rises of Grindelwald and Voldemort.

** About [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5w21_Vphbg][this]] much?

But I honestly think it depends on the story. Canon-compliant stories shouldn't see Harry buying his way out of every obstacle, but he shouldn't have to worry about saving for a house, dependants, etc.

In an AU, though? I think it's up to the author. Harry's family history allows for a certain amount of poetic license where his inherited wealth is concerned, IMO.

With all that being said, show and tell is so important here. No one wants to read an entire bank statement in a fanfic. There are better ways, like having Harry drink phoenix tear-infused volcanic water out of a pure orichalum goblet to rehydrate after the daily morning run around his twenty acre property.

New headcanon: The wizarding world is so old-fashioned because their economy is incapable of growing like it should due to a money supply that is far too small. After about 1870, goblins realized that economics is a better way than war to keep wizards from growing too powerful. The goblins are huge supporters of the Statute of Secrecy because if galleons were too freely convertible into muggle money, much-needed inflation would hit the wizarding world.

** I tend to assume that Harry is wealthy enough to live out a few years after Hogwarts without much trouble, including paying for a first home and what he needs to live. So, half a million $ in Galleons seems good, if a bit on the high end of what I generally assume. For the story's purposes he can buy equipment on a whim, but his money isn't a source of power on it's own.

Wizarding Society doesn't seem to be comparable with 20th/21st century capitalism. For example, my goblins don't do loans. They make their money with fees and payments for services as well as the enchanting and crafting of weapons and tools. But for loans they would need trust, and Goblins do not trust anybody. Loans are therefore only a private thing. I also don't assume interests. Money in my headcanon's wizarding world is very much the basic idea of a currency - a symbolic representation of the worth of products and services, there to make trading these things easier. It doesn't have to be any more profound, since the wizarding economy seems very basic and small. In the same vein I also assume that most wizards and witches don't work, except in their own gardens or fields to grow what cannot be transfigured.

For a ranking of wealth, I assume that the Malfoys are right on top, together with other Sacred 28 families. The Blacks /were/ the top, until their House got practically dismantled. But neither of those families even got close to any amount of wealth you can hoard with the tools and tricks of modern capitalism. These families have shares and ownership of manufacturers and workshops who provide products like brooms to the general public, and their wealth is /only/ coming from selling those products.

** I'm mostly fine with any level as long as it is used. The problem in some stories is they give him some large amount and the only thing they do with it is have him go shopping and spend .0000001% of it or just make some item randomly expensive then never revisit his wealth in any significant way.

Make him poor and it can give you a way to build tension.

Make him upper middle class and he doesn't need to work much but can't buy god. Takes some tension away but you can have him work less/adventure more. This is also the path many stories take by ignoring wealth entirely.

Make him super wealthy and you can have him use money to affect changes to britain or the world at large, funding other schools or major projects such as bootstrapping the wizarding world or solving climate change or getting offworld or funding all muggleborns way into the wizarding world etc.

The down side of this one is what I mentioned earlier, people have a knee jerk reaction to make harry rich as a way to power but then never touch it again and all it does is make your story look childish or make you look like it is your first story and you didn't reason out your plot.

The last category is where you make him the richest person on the planet. I don't really see the point of this one unless you are doing a story about how harry learns to be a true philanthropist and world player outside of the wizarding world. Could be an interesting story if someone really tries. Sadly the stories that go for the super rich route are almost always when he is 11 he discovers this wealth then all the bitches flock to his dick, seems silly.

tldr: Make him how you want but think about your reasons for it and use the wealth or lack of as a way to build your story and i'll be happy.

** Well canonically, Harry should have enough to comfortably support a family of 3 for a least a year whilst unemployed, plus the inheritance from Sirius, which I am inclined to believe was grossly understated by Dumbledore. Furthermore, given the age of the Potter Family and the knowledge of their being the last surviving line of the Peverells, who were also a prominent amongst their contemporaries, Harry's wealth in terms of heirlooms and artefacts that must have accumulated over the 800 years that the family has existed, is also far greater than we are led to believe.

** I figure it this way. James and Lily didn't seem like they had to work to support themselves, so the Potter fortune as it stood in 1981 was enough to sustain them. So they die and there's no vault activity for the next 10 years. In my head, Goblin banks operate like regular banks, using the money deposited with them to make loans and generate more wealth, so by the time 10 years pass, there's quite a bit more in the vault. Then Harry's at school with modest needs, so it grows for another 7 years. By the time he leaves school, the Potter fortune has been quietly growing for almost 20 years.

Then there's the investment he made with WWW. He might have thought of it as a one-off, but Fred and George didn't and consider him a silent partner, so there's another income stream. He's a property owner with Number 12 and I imagine the cottage (such as it is) in Godric's Hollow. Number 12 probably doesn't generate anything, but he could easily sell the land the cottage was on and invest that money either in another property such as a flat in London or something else.

In my mind, since Harry was raised in the Muggle world, he would be aware of the Muggle economy and would make strategic investments in order to give himself and his family everything they need. Magical world goes to shit? No worries, plenty of Muggle cash. Muggle economy takes a downturn? Good old Gringott's is there.

When you get to a certain point, money begets money--it reaches a sort of critical mass. I like to think that Harry definitely has "fuck you" money, but he's not one to sit around on his ass. He's someone that needs to be doing something. Also, I gave Harry a Black Card because it's fun and why not?

** At the moment I'm writing a story where Harry is studying some Peverell books and finds a way to go back in time to stop the First Blood War.

At the moment I've got him starting from literally no money.

My thought process in that is that there's no reason for the Peverells to have any money left over. Either 1.) They simply relinquished their wealth over to the Potters when Iolanthe married. 2.) They didn't have much money to begin with, and it's all been spent up with service fees to the Goblins. 3.) Any money they had was put in a vault somewhere that wasn't Gringotts, since it is likely that the Peverells stopped existing before Gringotts was a thing.

Basically I try to think of a way to make the story believable. I could understand if Harry inherited a lot of wealth from the Potters and Blacks, making him quite wealthy. But I think simply giving Harry all the solutions makes for a boring story.

**** I think so? Like I read alot of Avengers HP crossovers and I think alot of authors there do it well.

If Harry works it's for fun. He has enough to buy a house Tony Stark would like, start a business, and casually buy new wardrobes and vehicles with enough left to still throw arund and not worry about income.

** So it heavily depends on the story needs, not to mention what sort of exchange rate you are working with for Galleons and Dollars/Pounds.

However, my view on it was that the Potters were quite wealthy initially. This is based upon the history of the Potters and their position within the Wizarding world, plus the fact that James and Lily clearly did not have to work and could remain in hiding for a while not to mention help support a war. So clearly they had plenty of wealth initially.

It has been estimated that the Malfoys are worth $850 million. So I figure the Potters were at one time easily pushing $100 million. Just a note... the Malfoy wealth number is based on the value of gold in the real world, not the originally estimated exchange rate which people have always questioned as being far too low. But we can still use it as a comparison and then one can scale it as they see fit.

The questions are then, how much did the first war eat into that wealth, and did that wealth grow as Harry aged up?

I would not be surprised if the war and other complications led to a significant drop in the Potter's wealth, but I still can't see them not being millionaires. So in my view what is initially in Harry's vault should at the very least be a couple million dollars. Enough to be wealthy but not enough to necessarily completely not work in the Wizarding world.

HOWEVER, throw in the Black family inheritance, and the seed money and investment in WWW, and Harry very likely would not have to work in his lifetime if he chooses not to (which he wouldn't). My guess is that upon Harry's 18th birthday he would have a net worth of $25 million minimum with growth potential.

And all this is assuming that Goblins do not provide interest on gold kept in their vaults which I firmly believe that they do.

** The answer in numerical terms depends on your approach to the magical economy. However, the number in functional terms should be, I think, enough to be considered rich, but not enough to be considered very rich. The Muggle world equivalent would probably be Â£1-3 million, including real estate value (equivalent in terms of relative social position, not in terms of exchange rates).

**** But unless he literally has billions and billions of dollars available to invest, there's no way he owns even so much as 1%. T Rowe Price owns about 3% of both Google and Microsoft and they manage an $800B investment portfolio. That's the kind of money it takes to own large amounts of stock. And 1% is a large amount when we're talking big companies like this.

***** I do not recall saying he owned a specific percentage, just that he could have invested. FWIW, I work at yonder Fruit Company and I did the math. If I'd kept my options, I'd have over $3M at the current price. So, if Harry had invested $3000 when the price was $9 like it was in 2002 ...

** Wealth is an interesting thing. Like, someone had to accumulate it at some point in time, but people go way overboard on how much is realistic given the size of the wizarding world. And, like, how many people are actually "living without having to work" off that amount - at some point it has to run out.

Honestly, I don't think the exact number matters at all. And I will close any fic that actually gives a seven figure number or higher, pretty much without exception. If you want to have it so Harry has enough to do whatever Plot Gimmicks you need him to do, fine, but if the wealth itself ever becomes what the plot is circled around, then no thanks. It's just not interesting. And political intrigue should never be based around the number of zeroes in someone's bank account.

But it doesn't have to. That what investments are for. You live off of the interest, not the principle.

** One note: in most societies, old wealth like the Malfoys appear to have isn't just in pure money/gold. It's often in titles, land, property, etc etc. So there could be a situation where Harry (or any newly wealthier person) has the same amount of liquid currency as the Malfoys, but the Malfoys are still wealthier due to land, connections, government positions, etc. An example of this is how L. Malfoy was on the Board of Governors.

** It depends on my story. Right now i have a noodling story where he has 77,777,777.77 and has spent about a million of it so far buying some properties in star's hollow and some nice cars.

In darkness ascendant he has the literal wealth of a whole world but he can't really do anything with it because it would upset the economy so he has about 2 million galleons to start off with but he's growing that while sirius has about six to ten million he's investing in harry's ideas. But in darkness ascendant the pound to galleon is 50:1 instead of 5:1.

In trek to the stars, harry has access to multiple planets' assets but is also building a fleet of ships, purchasing armaments and reverse-engineering muggle tech to remake it magically. So while he's technically a trillionaire it's on paper. Also, galleons are mo longer the big coin. Inflation has made two more coins be invented so the sickle is the smallest with knuts no longer used/made.
