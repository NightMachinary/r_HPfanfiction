Hi all, I am writing a Rita Skeeter Autobiography (Title TBD and I am taking suggestions!)

Does anyone have any head canons they have about Rita's life that they would like seen or anything they think would be particularly interesting to explore? I am looking for any ideas :]


** I said it in another comment, and I don't think I've ever heard of someone else having this head canon.

  I like to think Rita Skeeter is a descendant of Beedle the Bard. Their family has always had the propensity for snooping and an affinity for beetle Animagus forms. In his day, Beedle was a nuisance like Rita and the Peverell brothers were very upset that he popularized their work.

** There's a fic called Logos in which Rita and Umbridge have a fling that is tied to politics and power. I take it as just short of Canon.

** Her house is an interesting point to discuss. I think personality-wise she was probably a Slytherin, in which case one has to wonder about her relationship to Bellatrix Black, who was likely a dormitory mate (or one year above her).

edit: it isn't stated anywhere that she was at Hogwarts at all though, so you could write her like that too.
