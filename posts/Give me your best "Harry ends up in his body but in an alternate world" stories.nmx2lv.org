Preferably gen, and if there are ships, preferably canon ones.


** I know its different but its one of my fav fics and this fic does have alternate dimension but there is no Harry Potter in that world..... basically what would happen if Tom Riddle did not become Voldemort, its gen and the reason I am suggesting is coz its really really good...

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.

** The Lone Traveler series if you haven't read it already. It's originally by The Professional, but it was vastly extended by dunuelos (I'm linking just one by dunuelos, but they have a lot of them!). The good thing about the later is that if you don't like a particular universe in which Harry appears, you can generally just skip that chapter and move onto the next world.

(the premise makes it sound like time travel, it's not)

  After spending half his life trying to rid the world of Voldemort, Harry Potter finally succeeds. However, the price has been high. Too high. Unfortunately, when Harry risks his life to go back and â€˜do things right', something goes wrong...

  Finding himself in another universe, Harry makes the perfectly logical choice and adopts his younger self, destroys this world's leftover Voldie pieces, and tries his best to avoid happy goblins.
