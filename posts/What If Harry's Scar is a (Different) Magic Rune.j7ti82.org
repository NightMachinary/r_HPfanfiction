There's a fanon theory that Harry's famous lightning bolt scar is a sowilo, a rune in Elder Futhark that represents the sun or power in general. Today I learned that the Phoenician +alphabet+ abjad has [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nun_(letter][the letter nun]] which looks very similar to sowilo but means "snake".

What if Harry's Parselmouth ability does come from his scar, but not in the way Dumbledore thought? What if it's because he had the +rune+ letter for snake magically etched into his skull?

***** Interesting. Especially given that the Hebrew Aleph-Bet is the origin of the term Alphabet (to the best of my recollection, Hebrew being older than Latin), despite Hebrew script being abjad, rather than alphabet.

****** Then it would be Phoenician, not Hebrew, with ʾālep and bēt. And Proto-Sinaitic is even older and is also thought to have had similar letter names.

However, the term itself looks like it uses Greek "alpha", not "alep" or "aleph", and Wikipedia agrees with my suspicion:

  The English word alphabet came into Middle English from the Late Latin word alphabetum, which in turn originated in the Greek ἀλφάβητος (alphabētos)

** Interesting idea though I guess the big issue with this is why/how he got it.

The sowilo rune makes a certain amount of sense as it's both/or either why he survived the killing curse and how Voldy's soul fragment didn't instantly overpower baby Harry's undeveloped mind.

Why would Lily use that rune. Who else could've done it and why. Of maybe it's a byproduct of the failed killing curse and Voldy's residual magic after the destruction of his body, though that feels like a flimsy reason.

Problem is that its canon that the reason for the scar's shape is that it is literally just the wand motion for the killing curse

I don't think it is. As best I can track down, that idea was started by a random twitter user, sourcing the [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Killing_Curse][HP Fandom wiki]] (not Pottermore or the books), which had a picture of the hand movement, but that picture doesn't have any listed source (only part of that info block that lacks a listed source). I've seen speculation that it was from one of the games, but the wand movement was never mentioned in the books, JKR's twitter, or Pottermore. As to the movies, everyone just kind of points without making distinct wand movements for it, so that doesn't help either. Also the listed hand movement on the fandom wiki is mirrored to Harry's scar, which is just odd.

*** Not really. Book one had Dumbledore travel by broom because she hadn't invented apparition yet. Also, Harry is /really/ dumb. Just, in general. Like, his first reaction to Dobby popping up and mentioning how his master makes him torture himself is to strangle the little guy for getting him in trouble. That's just off the top of my head, by the way. The little detail of his scar isn't that deep, she just thought a lightning bolt was a cool symbol for the hero to have on his head.

**** To be fair with Harry empathy is not really something easily developed at twelve years of age after an at least non-affectionate potentially abusive childhood. He knew very well that he could get in trouble with the Dursley's if they found Dobby there, he also knew that he couldn't actually use magic to defend himself without being possibly expelled from the world he considered his home, my guess is that any preoccupation he may have had concerning the strange creature that randomly popped in his bedroom trying to get him to stay with his hated relatives instead of going back to the place he considers his true home and admitted having tried to manipulate him by stealing his mail was overshadowed by his preoccupation over his own well-being. The guy later let Voldemort off him without knowing he would get the chance of coming back, he is allowed the odd selfish moment now and then.

**** Harry isn't dumb.\\

There's many more instances but I'll move past this point.\\
There's a difference between putting thought into things and knowing everything before hand.\\
As a writer, I do this a lot. Half-way into a project, I come up with something else. For her, it was the series. Once a book is out there, it's out there. You can't go back and edit it. That's why I think one should have all the books at least drafted before publishing one. Things get better over time, and you come up with more stuff.\\

I'm also a writer. The thing with glaring plot inconsistencies like these is that you either plan everything out beforehand so they don't creep up on you, or you keep in mind everything you've already written so you don't contradict yourself, even if it means you can't include the cool new idea you just thought of.

******* You're confusing the fictional character with the in universe character.

That lady didn't do that much planning. A lot of it was off the cuff and happened to work together because it's a magical universe where "A Wizard Did It" is normal. Her poor planning, especially in the early books, is very evident. An absolute idiot author can write a strong, smart Chad character. Just watch me do it

"There was a big strong smart guy named Chad who could bench press the sun with just the goosebumps on his biceps. He was also super smart and defeated every chessmaster in the world after seven years of no food, water, or sunlight."

There. An absolute idiot writing a genius character. And look at that great planning! The time he beat all the chessmasters is obviously the time he bench pressed the sun because there's no food, water, or sunlight in space. Errr, maybe not the last one but that's just a minor plot hole, right? Totally not making that connection to be extra snarky.
