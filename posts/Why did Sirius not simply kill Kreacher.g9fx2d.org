** Well, probably because that would be a pretty fucked up thing to do, even if he hated Kreacher. Before betraying Sirius, all Kreacher really did was be annoying and mutter nasty things at people. Just executing him is the sort of thing his insane family would do, with their wall of house elf heads. And what difference would it make that he was wanted for killing 13 people? He didn't kill them, and as far as we know, hadn't ever killed anyone.

*** What I meant by that is that it's not like he could have gotten lower in terms of public opinion. He wouldn't have killed the Muggles, obviously, but he definitely would have killed Peter if he had been quicker. It's not like Kreacher was only annoying, but he was an active nuisance and always in the legs of everyone when the Order was making Grimmauld Place an actual livable place and he always tried and sometimes succeeded at hiding items cursed by the Blacks.

**** Peter betrayed Sirius' best friends to Voldemort, and framed Sirius for it. That's a much better reason to kill someone than just being annoying and senile. The general public wouldn't have any idea what Sirius did in Grimmauld Place anyway, but I think most of the Order, and definitely Dumbledore, would have correctly seen Sirius executing Kreacher for being annoying as psychotic.

Recall Dumbledore's words to Harry about Kreacher, even after Kreacher betrayed him and Sirius:

#+begin_quote
  “And,” whispered Harry, his hands curled in cold fists on his knees, “and Hermione kept telling us to be nice to him ---”

  “She was quite right, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “I warned Sirius when we adopted twelve Grimmauld Place as our headquarters that Kreacher must be treated with kindness and respect. I also told him that Kreacher could be dangerous to us. I do not think that Sirius took me very seriously, or that he ever saw Kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a humans ---”

  “Don't you blame --- don't you --- talk --- about Sirius like ---” Harry's breath was constricted, he could not get the words out properly. But the rage that had subsided so briefly had flared in him again; he would not let Dumbledore criticize Sirius. “Kreacher's a lying --- foul --- he deserved ---”

  “Kreacher is what he has been made by wizards, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “Yes, he is to be pitied. His existence has been as miserable as your friend Dobby's. He was forced to do Sirius's bidding, because Sirius was the last of the family to which he was enslaved, but he felt no true loyalty to him. And whatever Kreacher's faults, it must be admitted that Sirius did nothing to make Kreacher's lot easier ---”

  “Sirius did not hate Kreacher,” said Dumbledore. “He regarded him as a servant unworthy of much interest or notice. Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike. . . . The fountain we destroyed tonight told a lie. We wizards have mistreated and abused our fellows for too long, and we are now reaping our reward.”

  “SO SIRIUS DESERVED WHAT HE GOT, DID HE?” Harry yelled.

  “I did not say that, nor will you ever hear me say it,” Dumbledore replied quietly. “Sirius was not a cruel man, he was kind to house-elves in general. He had no love for Kreacher, because Kreacher was a living reminder of the home Sirius had hated.”

***** Except Dumbledore's words aren't really from a place of authority here. And they are quite wrong. As I said to someone else:

#+begin_quote
  If you don't think being called a disappointment and other things from the age of five and a blood-traitor and every possible obscenity there is by someone who lives in the same house as you (who also echoes what the rest of his family says, btw) from the age of eleven/twelve mentally marks someone than I would like to question your insight in human psychology.
#+end_quote

Sirius and Kreacher date from the former's childhood, and Kreacher is very nasty and deliberate in his choice of words. Now put that though a twelve years-long Azkaban filter. I'm not saying it's the right thing, I'm saying it's not really outside of the realm of possibilities for Sirius to do it.

****** Quite true, verbal abuse at that age would definitely have a strong enough effect to - theoretically, at least - cause Sirius to want to kill Kreacher, but Sirius also holed up in his hated family home with his hated family elf seemingly just because Dumbledore said so, and it's not out of character for most people to go with what Dumbledore says over what they think. He's basically the Rowling-Magical Britain version of Superman, and if Superman tells you to do something and you're not a supervillain or a supervillain minion, you're probably gonna do it.

** Watsonian explanation: Sirius is one of the good guys, and good guys don't kill their brainwashed slaves (what Kreacher is) just because they are annoying.\\
His only true betrayal is when he went to the Malfoys, and even there the value of the informations he gave them is . . . trivial at best (Harry really like his godfather?) and he sais to Harry that Sirius was "not there". Even with it, the whole DoM battle and Sirius death are at least 90% on Sirius impulsiveness (like, if you go to London from Hogwarts, which take litteraly hours to do, can't you take 5 more minutes to check the house before?).\\
He could have been killed after his betrayal, but Dumbledore still mainly had pity for him, and Harry chose to just make him do something he hates rather that the freedom of Death.

Doylish explanation: Kreacher was needed later in the story. I'm not sure Rowling had already planed his whole conflict with Dobby about Harry, but the Locket Horcruxe and Regulus sacrifice where already foreshadowed, and she needed Kreacher to tell the story to the heroes.
