Maybe Harry's invisibility cloak works like the fabled cloak should and Moody's eye can't see through it (so his warning Moody not to let Snape get it doesn't work), or maybe Snape is quicker, or Harry just freezes in shock. What happens next? Would Snape jump on the chance to punish Harry and miss Crouch? Would Crouch attack Snape if he realised his cover was in danger (combine that with Harry's cloak being properly impenetrable maybe). Would Snape play it cool and inform the headmaster? Would Snape attack Crouch? How do you think things would go?


** The only thing I can say with confidence is that Snape would definitely take the cloak and then gleefully assign a ten year long detention to Harry.

After that, it's up for debate. How much does Crouch trust Snape? Enough to put the Dark Lord's resurrection plan in his hands? Probably not. So he would try to attack -- but not in front of Harry.

Snape, for his part, can't really "expose" Crouch; at least, not publically. He's still playing spy. But he will, no doubt, inform Dumbledore the first moment he can.

** Without the warning Snape, would likely recognize the parchment and keep quiet about it in front of Crouch/Moody. I don't think Crouch would have a reason to truly attack Snape yet -- he seems to still be ascertaining Snape's true loyalties.

If Snape has access to the contents of the map and saw the name Bartemius Crouch at odd times when he is supposedly ill, he'd definitely tell Dumbledore. Also he might try to see where the real Moody is on the map and realize that the locations don't add up.
