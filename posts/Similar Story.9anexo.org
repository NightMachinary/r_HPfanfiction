  Despair over the loss of his godfather in the Battle of the Dept. of Mysteries, followed by abandonment, isolation and hopelessness drive Harry to try and end his own life. Though death itself cannot halt his just vengeance against the Dark Lord, nor keep him from attaining that which he has ever been denied; someone to love and be loved by.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is depressed. Being shunned by the majority of the school for being different, bullied by some for having a power that only two other people has, he is at the end of his tether. What happens when he goes to the Astronomy Tower and sees Hermione and Ron discussing him...and how the Dursley's were right about him being a complete freak...
