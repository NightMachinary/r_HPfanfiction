It's like, in the far future, the Statute of Secrecy comes down and muggles learn about magic, and they want to know, 'how can we do magic?'.

So the scientists get busy; for ethics reasons they can't really experiment on any humans, so using their cloning knowledge they create near-humans, sort of the equivalent of today's lab mice, and breed several generations of them until they get a) a living creature that can use magic, and has the same order of physical and mental capabilities as a human.

The reason that these near-humans, or the first house-elves, are so subservient is because, intellectually, while they have the same brainpower as a human, their instincts are tweaked so that instead of seeking their own health/happiness/self-determination/gratification/prestige/whatever, they're moreso patterned after strong A.I., made with a desire to serve and care for others with little concern for their own needs. Engineered, not evolved.

So with that success, muggle scientists started on the first step in giving normal muggles magical capabilities, but since these near-human experiments were human-safe, a company snapped them up, marketed them as house-elves, and started selling them en-masse to muggles fascinated by magic and wanting it in their home naow.

...And then a time-travel accident happened and some people with their elves got sucked a few thousand years into the past, some witches & wizards snapped them up, and the rest is history. Stupid time-turners.

Am I drunk? Those mandarines tasted a little fermented when I gobbled them up.

*** So, you don't think there's any fanfic potential in the idea, then? No events where muggles & house-elves accidentally arrive from the future with advanced technology?

***** Well of course its dumb.

Unfortunately, Rowling kind of opened Pandora's (no, not you Mrs. Lovegood) Box in Prisoner of Azkaban when she introduced the time-turner, and its never been the same since. She tried to shut the box by getting rid of it, and even put a lock on the box when she destroyed the time-turners in Order of the Phoenix, but once you let out the monster you can't put it back in the box.

Just to make things worse, years later Rowling seems to have decided, "Well, its been long enough, and I'm out o f ideas, so maybe we can try opening the box again." Only this time, she took a sledgehammer and smashed the box to pieces, so no one can really ignore what happened after Cursed Child.
