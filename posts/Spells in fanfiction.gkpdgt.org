** One thing you can do is supplement real spells with more general action.

Saying "Harry leapt behind the pillar just as the white streak of the man's spell hit the staircase and shattered the stone" eludes to a spell without you naming what it is.

*** What if Harry is the one casting the spell? Obviously, voldy and most of his minions can cast silently, so there is no problem there, but when Harry casts (either silently or not) in my fic, I want the readers to know the spells he cast

**** Unless you're writing some OP Harry, he won't know many different spells. And unless you're writing some duel tournament, he won't need many different spells, either - learning to cast a few spells perfectly is usually much more efficient than barely-casting a lot of different spells. Disarming Charm, Reductor Curse, Blasting Curse, Stunner, Cutting Curse or something like it covers a lot of tings. Then add Transfiguration for the clever bits, or conjuring, and you're pretty much set.

***** Well it is a powerful Harry, the eventual Dark Lord's equal, and it makes sense to have Harry have lots of spells up his sleeve.

****** Most of the "original" spells are bad in combat. I cringe when I read about "clever combos" where you only have to hit the enemy with this spell, and then you can follow up with this other spell, and he is down - yeah, if you can hit him with one spell, pick a spell that ends the fight right away.

**** Hmmm I'm not sure. I actually don't ever write action. Perhaps saying that Harry reciprocated a spell could also save you from coming up from something new. Or saying more generally that he "fired a series of offensive spells" is a way to say it more generally.

I think you'll have to use some actual spells, either canon or those of your own making, but there are a few ways to be more general.

** Just skip the incantations, saying a character used a curse and then describing the effects is perfectly fine.

*** And this is something like 70% of the spell work in canon. We read “Harry stunned him” at least as often as “Harry shouted Stupefy!” Especially in fight scenes.

** My advice is to let your imagination run wild and invent your own. You can use google translate for Latin, Greek, and perhaps Icelandic, and then just slightly change the word if it's too hard to pronounce.

And like another comment suggests, if your characters are competent with silent casting, you can skip this step altogether and just describe the color and what it does.

** I don't write any more but when I did I used a Latin-English dictionary to invent plausible-sounding spells. It was one of the more enjoyable parts of writing.

** Some fanfic writers do base their spells off translations of Latin. If it's not immediately obvious, they'll generally add an author's note on what the spell is and what it does, and all that.

*** Thanks. I was planning on doing something similar, but describing the spells in the books from where Harry reads them, or from the person who teaches him.
