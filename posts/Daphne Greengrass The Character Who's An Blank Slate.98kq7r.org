Daphne Greengrass, a character that much is not known about, neither her physical appearance. personality, (both platonic and romantic) relationships and affiliation.

She's the perfect character to play around, because nothing is strictly defined about her. beyond her name, the fact she's a pure-blood and that she has a younger sister in Astoria. a blank slate, as I've said in the title.

Daphne can be portrayed in so many interesting and different ways because of that, and yet, her most popular depiction is as the blonde-haired blue-eyed [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefrostingIceQueen][cold-hearted Ice Queen of Slytherin]] . why is that? what makes that characterization of Daphne the most popular one?

And most importantly, how would you write Daphne personally to put your own spin on her?


** Writers like her exactly because of her blank slate and the canon name.

I personally hate the 'Ice Queen' trope with a passion now. It has become so boring and repetitive.

That being said, I do enjoy quite a few Harry/Daphne fics, among them [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9095016/1/Betrayal][Betrayal]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation][Contractual Invalidation]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/1/Dodging-Prison-and-Stealing-Witches-Revenge-is-Best-Served-Raw][Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches]] (this one is an exception), and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6943436/1/The-Pureblood-Princess][The Pureblood Princess]], linkffn(9095016;11697407;11574569;6943436).

During his years at Hogwarts, Harry had never singled out Daphne (and Tracey Davis) for any kind of transgressions or anything special, whereas he had dissed every other single Slytherin of his year in his thoughts. That led me to believe that Daphne Greengrass was:

- was not a great beauty or Harry would have remarked in his thoughts. Harry did have eyes for hot girls.
- was not an openly confrontational person and knew how to keep a low profile.
- was likely not a blood purist since there was zero evidence of her antagonizing Hermione. (JKR might have said something bad about her, but I at least haven't seen that particular interview)
- could be one of "a handful Slytherins" who came back with Slughorn in the Final Battle.
- had hidden strengths that a writer could expand on.

Stuff like this just reminds me of the lack of vision JKR had for her characters and world (at least in regards to the epilogue and post-series). It's like Magical Britain is some kind of backwater incestuous Texan town.

** Simple, no physical description of her is ever given. Daphne is basic super hot Slytherin #1, Cho Chang is basic super hot Ravenclaw #1, Sue Bones is basic super hot Hufflepuff #1 and Katie Bell is basic super hot Gryffindor #1.

I'm pretty sure she first became popular as a character in lemons and stuff. Given the personality assigned to her in the most tropey fanficions, it wouldn't shock me at all to learn that it was mainly first developed by smut writers. The whole heiress ice queen persona is just to differentiate her from other members of the harem. It's just flushed-out enough to be able to spot her in a big pile of limbs whenever she has a line to speak during an orgy.

If compelled to write my own Daphne Greengrass, I would probably start back from scratch. Give the poor girl a bit more personality than a B-list character from a crappy japanese dating sim.

PS: Please fix your title... "The character who is A blank slate" would be acceptable. "The slytherin blank slate" would be okay. "Daphne Greengrass: as slated, a serene stare at the Slytherin blank slate" would be goofy but my personal favorite.

** I'm not a fan of "ice queen" Daphne, mainly because I think that characterisation does not fit with children well. Perhaps it could be a good characterisation for an adult Daphne, but I don't like the trope of super political teenagers or Slytherin house being some kind of cult.

The stance I take is that Slytherins are just normal children like the rest of Hogwarts, and behave as such. Of course, the social elite are well represented in the house, and so many will have had a privileged upbringing, and will display certain unconscious biases, but there should be (at least in the first few years of Hogwarts) something quite innocent about it.

With this in mind, "ice Queen Slytherin girl" (whether Daphne or someone else) doesn't quite fit with my vision for Slytherin house, in so far as it refers to someone who constantly comports themselves according to correct etiquette, who conceals their feelings, behaves very formally, and has their entire life and behaviour oriented around some political stance.

Another thing I dislike about it is that it presents "correct pureblood behaviour" as quite one dimensional, with the "ice queen" being the extreme end of a linear scale - "maximum pureblood". Not only is this uncanonical (in canon, "pureblood" does not equate to "social elite") I think this displays a lack of familiarity with real life upper class people.

In Victoria Potter, which features the Slytherin girls heavily (being a fem!Harry in Slytherin), I am attempting to use Pansy and Daphne as a kind of case study in how there can be multiple dimensions within "correct upper class behaviour".

Pansy represents the "metropolitan upper class". She's into fashion and carefully selects her outfits. She's not especially bright but she values academic performance and works hard because it's expected by her parents. She likes things neat and ordered and done according to rules, everything in its correct place (with her, naturally, at the top). She prefers controlled environments and dislikes the mess of the outdoors. She's aware of her privilege and enjoys it.

Daphne, meanwhile, represents the "rural upper class". She dresses well, but with a certain informal effortlessness rather than careful coordination. Practical, outdoor pursuits are valued as highly as academic success, and she enjoys adventures through bogs and forests. She has a happy-go-lucky approach to life and enjoys spontaneity. She considers herself "normal" and is unappreciative of the gilded life she leads.

(Note that I use the terms "urban/rural" as useful labels for their characteristics, not literal descriptions. In the literal sense, they're both rural upper class, in that they both live with a large amount of land, outside of urban areas.)

Each of these girls is based on girls I went to school with: on the one hand, the "fashion show" types who were big into music and drama, who tended to be the children of upper-middle class parents like lawyers and doctors; on the other hand, the "horse girl" types, more into sports and parties, who tended to be the children of genuine upper-class people (i.e. farmers).

My Daphne was introduced to muggle dome mystery suspense novels as a young girl by Tracy's mother and, combined with what she thinks she knows about Slytherin, comes to Hogwarys expecting plots and manipulations and Machiavellian 11 year olds. She turns out to be completely wrong about the other students but is constantly claiming she is right about everything because of all the plots and intrigue surrounding Harry.

We already have a nerdy girl, a upbeat beautiful and sporty girl, a crazy tomboy kind of girl (maybe even 2), a "classic beauty" unattainable girl, etc. These serve as a basis for all kinds of romantic entanglements, but there's really not a female character from canon that could convincingly pull off the: "I totally hate you, baka!"

How about Daphne as someone who sides with muggles, muggle-born and wizards & witches who were raised by muggles? that hasn't been done yet right? Daphne wears their clothes, has their memorabilia in her room. maybe she even dyes her hair, like say brown with blue highlights for example.

And if her parents and sister are kept as pure-blood supremacists who are Death Eaters, maybe that type of behavior can actually get Daphne disowned as the elder daughter by her parents. so she's living in an apartment of her own that she maintains via having a job when she gets the Hogwarts letter.

Well, every Daphne story I have ever read portrayed her like a pureblood that is different. As the unusual and tolerant Slytherin, the pureblood who is not a supremacist and quickly becomes a rebel. I do not remember where, but I have definitely read something where she was disowned. As for being muggleborn: You would have to have a pretty fantastic explanation to put a muggleborn in Slytherin, since its founder literally left a monster in the school to kill all muggleborns. Applied Cultural Anthropology put Hermione in Slytherin and tried its hardest to show the reader why and it still feels forced.

Where did I say banging Hermione? I'm legitimately curious, because I can't remember even typing such a thing in the first. and I do believe, that done well it could be a good base for a personality as long people remember to differentiate Daphne from canon Sirius. and there is a certain amount of politics involved in even the canon books like Order of the Phoenix or to a smaller extent, Half-Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows.

**** Hellblazer Daphne /has no personality!/ She is only mentioned in Order of the Phoenix as taking her OWLS with Hermione. :) She did not /get/ a character description or anything! She can be used for any story purpose. :)

** Anytime the 'Ice Queen' is used in one of my stories, I play it for laughs: "What? People call me the Ice Queen? But... how do they even notice me?"

** I don't mind the Ice queen stuff as long as its just a mask.

my favourite use of Daphne in fics is as the Stoic Woobie.

A Daphne who in first year thought she had it all figured out, that had all sorts of plans about how she was going to be some political mastermind who though she was going to rule Slytherin house.

Only to be Crushed under the heel of the other Slytherin students, after being crushed she then after Joins Pansy Parkinson gangs for protection and then over the years she becomes the Stoic Woobie/ Ice Queen that most Fics portray her as.

Maybe add on some extra Tragedy to her story by having her have to make sacrifices to Protect her sister
