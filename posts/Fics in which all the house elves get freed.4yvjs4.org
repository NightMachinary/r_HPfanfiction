** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Witch Queen)

really like the story. give it a chance, the first chap is dark and the writing is kind of ornate. the later chaps are easier to read. the details matter. incomplete. ymmv.

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.

** The house elves are on their way to being freed in linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/507700]]) the sequel to Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them. As Harry considers himself a forest elf, freeing his 'brethren' is a big priority and he's gotten at least one law passed and six or seven elves freed so far.

  Harry is captured by wizards and brought to a castle. The wizards are obnoxious, but there's a lovely wood nearby which is quaintly named the "Forbidden" Forest. Harry thinks that's adorable.
