I remember reading a fic on FFN that has Harry marrying Susan Bones, Marietta Edgecombe and Milicent Bulstrode because of Dumbledore's manipulations.

It has many clich√©s but it was readable, at least for me.

PS: I don't know if it was completed or not.

PS2: As far as I remember it was between 6th or 7th year, because in the story Marietta hated Harry for the Incident with the sneak mark and Susan married Harry as a result of Amelia Bones dying.
