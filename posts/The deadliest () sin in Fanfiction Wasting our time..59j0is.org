So, this is sort of a rant, but I really think this is one of the biggest problems in Fanfiction, no matter which genre/pairing and I'm wondering if others agree with me:

Be it the introduction of a character we already know from canon in excruciating detail (without deviating from canon at all) or rehashing canon events via terrible information dumps; it's always shocking how much time and word-count the average Fic wastes on this kind of stuff. How often do I have to read a scene where Harry guides the Granger parents or Amelia Bones through a rambling retelling of his adventures? Is it really necessary to experience all the little details - including the fucking wand-weighing ceremony - of the tournament when the meat of your story happens at or after the third event? It all seems to come from a terrible fear of letting the actions of their characters speak for themselves and allowing the reader to infer the rest from that. It must be some kind of epidemic.

There are so many stories, where I find myself skimming through multiple pages or sometimes chapters of completely pointless exposition without any kind of payoff and usually not missing much by doing so. Not to mention that this sort of plagiarism (even though it's probably unintentional) doesn't really improve the quality of the story. I've been looking through my favorites and I noticed that many of them feature original ideas and content and have very little of this kind of clumsy exposition. I won't even go into stories that may feature an original idea (or half of an idea), but think their readers are babies or mentally handicapped, so they decide to explain it again and again in as verbose a manner as possible: Harry comes up with a plan in a rambling multi page monologue, then - of course - we have the obligatory meeting with his friends/allies where he explains his plan /again/ and then while executing the plan we of course have to explain each step once more as it is happening (and having something explained three times isn't even the worst I've seen).

I can tolerate a lot of things (cliches, grammatical errors, head-hopping), but when I feel my time is being wasted by re-hashing canon or describing a single weekend in 200k words then I'm out. Not to put too fine a point on it, but brevity /is/ the soul of wit.


** Most of the times I feel like people don't know when to start their story. Especially in fanfiction you have the luxury of just dropping into the action asap. Everybody knows the characters, everybody knows what happened. Give them a paragraph of intro and then get on with it.

No changes in your fic before the third task? Then the best start for your story is exactly there.

There is nothing happening in first year? Start with Dobby and his visits at Privet Drive.

I agree. I abhor having the feeling of wasting my time with a fic.

For example, linkffn(Notebooks and Letters) - for me, this fiction was completely waste of time. As par the writer's word - "The 'true' version of Books 5, 6, and 7" - basically 99% of canon retelling & pairing H/Hr instead of H/G.

** I agree and disagree. I think rehashing canon events or summarising them in a conversation is definitely bad writing. However, I disagree that doing a full introduction for canon characters and locations is bad. In fact I feel quite the opposite.

The "ideal" fanfic is one that is of publishable quality, i.e. it could stand on its own as an independent story. Now, if it's a "sequel" to a canon then of course it can presume familiarity with the locations and characters of the stories to which it is a sequel e.g. a 4th year divergence can assume the reader knows about PS, CoS and PoA. But a 4th year divergence should not be acting as if the readers are familiar with GoF and later. They haven't been introduced yet in that continuity.

Not only is it lazy writing, it's also quite harmful to the story as it leads to reader frustration when they can assume some things from later canon but not others, without any consistent rule determining which elements have been retained and which have been changed.

I think I know what you're getting at. JKR if I remember correctly did that too in her books: She always 'introduced' Harry as if we didn't know him, but it was always very brief and most importantly not some kind of information dump. The beginning of the story always told us something about the character of Harry, but always through the events that unfolded around him (like using a flying car to travel to Hogwarts with his best mate: readers who already know from previous books that Harry is brave can focus on the adventure). It's principally showing instead of telling, which most Fanfic authors don't seem to understand.

**** That wasn't really what I meant. What I meant was, for example, including occlumency in a fic set prior to OotP and not explaining what it is to the reader, or glossing over the explanation of what it is. Just relying on the fact that the reader already knows what it is from having read canon. It's inherently bad writing (you could never do it in a real piece of literature that was to be published) and on top of that muddles the plot because what happens if your version of occlumency is different from the canon version but you're relying on readers implying canon occlumency into your story? Inconsistency is what happens.

***** I don't know, one of my favorite things about reading fan fiction is the extra context you have outside of the fic. So, maybe the characters hear about Occlumency and to them it's sort of this big mystery, but the author knows that the reader already knows what it is, so it's sort of like a little wink or an inside joke. Or seeing an event or character go differently than in canon, which is only special because we have a baseline canon to compare it to.

I agree with the necessity of being clear and consistent (in general, obviously there are fics that might do this differently on purpose), but I think it's a waste to say that fan fiction must be held to the same standards as original fiction. One of the greatest things about fan fiction is that it's explicitly not original fiction, and thus there are many freedoms available that would not have been available otherwise.

***** Okay I get it, but with Occlumancy - for example - you conveniently picked an example that can be explained in a sentence or two, which I don't really mind. Especially if it fits in the framework of the story: Most people don't know what Occlumency is so explaining it at some point makes sense. Still even there, maybe you shouldn't write a story that relies heavily on Occlumency - unless you have a fantastic new idea - because that topic has been heavily explored in Canon already (not to mention the billion of mindscape fortification castle cliches of Fanon). People seem to forget that JKR always added new lore in her books - I would probably not have read all books if she wrote all of them about Philosopher stones.

I will subtly disagree. To me, Harry Potter fic is sort of like the Commedia dell'Arte. We have a set of stock characters that everyone is familiar with so you don't have to introduce them, and an overall world that they get slotted into. What the author then needs to do is generate an interesting new scenario and execute it very well.

The beauty of it is that you don't, in fact, need to introduce the whole situation or produce something that could stand alone, because you /can/ presume familiarity of the reader with the canon.

This means, for example, that it is possible to produce short fiction with tremendous emotional impact, because there's a lot of background that you can presume the reader already has.

I only read fanfiction because it takes most of any given original book before you really understand what's going on.

With fanfic there is no need to explain who the Death Eaters are or why they hate this one kid in particular. You can just open with Crouch Jr being discovered at the world cup and everyone understands what those things mean.

** I mostly agree with this, especially the canon re-hash information dump. But I don't completely agree with the bit about character introductions. Mostly because first impressions are very important, so if I'm reading a fic where, for example, Harry spends his childhood raised by Sirius Black, then I would want to read/write his thoughts on the canon characters. Maybe he meets Ron and his first reaction is that "the red-headed boy looks poor and has dirt on his nose. His robes are ill-fitting, and his hands seem too big for his arms". This describes Ron accurately, not changing canon, but Harry's perception is changed, and showing this change in how he views otherwise canon characters gives the read a better understanding of Harry's character. Does that make sense?

As a writer, I tend to write things according to what the main character would or would not know. So if the main character has never been to Hogwarts, I describe Hogwarts as they see it. If they've never met a character, I describe that character from their perspective. On the flip side of that, I try not to do information dumps of canon information. For example, I am working on a Snape-centric story right now where Harry doesn't end up at Hogwarts until 6th year, and knows very little about the wizarding world. I had a scene where Harry asks Snape a bunch of questions, and I basically summed up everything that had happened in canon, and all of the major points that diverged from canon, in one paragraph. Ie: Snape told Harry about the first war, the rise and fall of the Dark Lord. He told him about Lily's death, and how Sirius Black had been framed for betraying the Potters'. etc etc.

Sorry for any babbling, I'm sleep deprived... lol.

** I think that its a fine line. While much is lazy writing sometimes recaps and the like are used to highlight certain points. Even if the divergence is later, something said earlier might have been what caused the writer to create the story and its either foreshadowing or highlighting this for the reader. Long conversations where Harry goes over his adventures is tiring for the reader but important if for some reason you have been living under a rock for a while, part of the reason you find this frustrating is you read a lot of fanfiction, if you hadn't read any for a few months it might be a useful reminder. It also allows the writer to spin them for a certain point. While you might not like certain tropes the adventure retelling allows someone to plant the seeds. It also highlights the fact that in the books Harry never spoke about his adventures nor got an outside view. It would be possible to cover this in a line with 'and so Harry told her/him all about his adventures' but that doesn't highlight what the writer might be wanting to highlight. Have you ever re-read a story fanfiction or otherwise where you see things you missed the first time? Be patient and if the rest of the story is better then the writer might have dropped some hints if you know what to look for.

** Hm, I can see both sides. When I try to write ff I generally orient myself with a "WWJKRD"?

If it's a longer fic (that essentially replaces at least one book) I'm totally fine with re-introducing the characters like Rowling does. The first few sentences of every HP book are always a retelling of what happened so far, intertwined with action. That's my goal, to do that as well. Rowling obviously knows how to write a book, and made it possible to get back into the story after a long break or to start with any one book (maybe except DH). I feel like that's a noble goal, and if you can achieve this without boring the reader to death (because you move the plot forward at the same time) then good on you!

For one-shots just assume the reader knows everything. But that's kinda obvious.

Problems occur when authors immediately jump to the payoff (love in chapter 1) and then ramble on and on about how perfect they are for each other and buying the perfect engagement ring that matches her eyes.

But I really need to make clear that exploring human nature and character driven story telling really are not exclusive to stories that appeal primarily to women (like your typical romance). One just has to look at "Measure of a Man" from Star Trek TNG (a pretty male dominated show in terms of viewership I think) to understand this.

******* I'll sum it up this way, to simplify (though your mileage may vary on that, as I sometimes make things more complicated than I intend to; if that happens to be the case then I apologise for it) the whole thing:

Whatever anyone considers “payoff” is up to them; some people want romance, others want actions, others want mystery. Much of what is written is low quality and as such it offers no payoff to those who wish for those things to happen realistically, believably, in an interesting way that keeps the tension at a somewhat decent level; still, there are people who are satisfied with even that level of writing, so writing crap is, in itself, not necessarily wasting the readers' time.

No, you waste your readers' time when there is no payoff for anyone, which is the case when you rehash canon stuff as it being a rehash means that the readers already know what will happen and how so there is no point in it and no new developments. It being written in an interesting way, a different way, with changed events or from a different perspective, can make it refreshing and keep the tension higher than the floor level, which means it would no longer be a waste of time, but enough writers don't even bother to do that that it's really confounding by now. I mean, seriously, how many people rehashed the troll encounter without changing anything? Or the tasks of the tournament?

PS. While I will agree that there is a certain correlation between the gender of the readers and what they /tend/ to prefer, it's not really gone far enough that putting it all on the readers' gender would do the job. I mean, there are men who prefer romance or series focused purely on character development, and there are women who prefer action and stuff of that ilk. Add to this the “This is a man's world already” and it's not really that your post /offended/ any singular reader but rather that you came across as a tad condescending, judgmental, and a bit of an ass too. Personally I really don't care about judging that because I really don't know you, but it's the attitude of this sort that made the people dislike what you wrote rather than simply the fact that you expressed an opinion that objectively does not seem to be true.

But I agree that new storylines and such are of course better, however not everyone is that creative and I wouldn't skip stories that aren't creative. I skip the action ones usually, and people writing them can get offended about such a thing too, I would understand that, although not everyone can have the same taste. Still, I would respect them, and try to judge them by other standards than I usually judge a fic on, being open for a new genre and now it seemed to me that fics focusing on character development did not get any respect. That was what I meant with the comment. In real life it always seems that typical masculine traits are valued the most above all too. The fact that I come accross as judgemental is because no-one has statistics about this kind of thing, so there really isn't anything else than feelings.

  Males always want new things: new new new, action, complicated plots, or they're bored. Women are interested in relationships between characters, investigating the human nature.

So what i'm reading is... your sexist? Or stereotypical?

*** First off, this comment is generalities. Counter-examples to everything I'm saying could be easily provided.

I couldn't disagree more. In my experience, the longest, most rambling, undirected time-wasting fics I've ever read were written by men. I think it comes from a lot of men being overly detail oriented, and focused on worldbuilding at the expense of character interaction. For example, I doubt you'd find a woman adding 8 schools to the Triwizard Tournament, a bunch of extra events with complicated scoring rules, and then including a tournament bracket in every single chapter. A fic that's based on relationships, in order to be effective, needs to be tightly plotted, and it needs to let the reader draw conclusions themselves; readers are always more effected by conclusions they've drawn than things they've been told. Also, I think women have (probably unfairly) had "Mary Sue!" screamed in your faces so many times about every character you write, that female authors are a lot more careful about this. It's fics written by men who send Harry on a shopping trip that takes 3 chapters, where he buys all sorts of cool stuff that the author would sure like to own! Then Harry has to spend another 2 chapters telling a gasping Susan Bones about all the awesome adventures he had in each previous book! Then Harry spends, like, an entire chapter doing nothing but listening to the author's favourite music!

It could be that I just have bad luck with authors whom I'm aware are male, though.

**** Huh? This supports what I meant to say in my comment. It's also my experience that men focus on worldbuilding in favor of character development (and tend to value it way more). Perhaps, to not offend people, I should not attach things to gender but rather a different mindset that seems to be common, but not limited to, a gender. In my opinion, relation-based fics do get away with a lot less planning ahead; not that I'd say that's a good thing of course, but there is a lot less to 'resolve' if it's about the inner world and relationships of one or more characters than with 10 or more elaborate plotlines unfding in 63178 different locations, with 71 different characters. I am curious to know why you think it's the other way around, though, so if you care to explain, I would be interested.

***** Sorry, I thought what you meant was that females write more fics that people like the OP might consider "time-wasting". My experience is that the fics that do the things OP is complaining about tend to be written by males. Also, in my experience, relationship fics are more deeply planned, because everything that happens tends to support the ship/character development the author is interested in. World-building fics just tend to ramble around for a few hundred thousand words and then stop.

******* I think this could be another factor. I've read world-building fics that rambled on and went nowhere, and liked them anyway. But I don't recommend them to people unless I know those people also love world-building. Similarly, I suspect all of my friends know me well enough that they won't recommend a romance to me, unless they think it's outstandingly good/special. So that means I only read the good romance fics, and that probably leaves me with the false impression that most romance fics are better plotted/written/planned/etc.

Another issue I have talking about gender in fanfic is that it can be really hard to associate a username with a gender on the internet. Brighter_days, for example, could really be either gender. So if I like a fic written by someone called brighter_days, obviously that person must be a guy! If I didn't like it, they're obviously a girl! Now I can draw conclusions about the kind of fics guys write, based on those assumptions! I've seen people do /exactly/ this, and it drives me nuts.

******** Yes that's true. You can't really use anecdotes as evidence and I was doing just that. Nobody researched fanfiction in this area and it wouldnt add much, it will benefit no-one. Men are just an easy target because theyre always the 'succesful ones' that dictate the status quo; so why should it be any different in fanfiction? But, I was wrong in this case on top of it, and even if they are, well, so be it.

So was I! We both have enough anecdotes to make for an interesting discussion. I just wanted to point them out as anecdotes, so that nobody would take the discussion too seriously, that's all. But even though all we've got are anecdotes, I still think the discussion was and is worth having, even if all it does is allow us to share perspectives/opinions with each other. I wouldn't say you are "wrong", anymore than I'd say I'm "right". We've just had different experiences in the same community.
