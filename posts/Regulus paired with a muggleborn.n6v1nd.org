I read a fic where Reg falls for a Muggle-born boy and I don't remember the name but I literally cried over it for like- hours heh. But if there r any other fics that pair Reg with a muggleborn. Preferably happy ending, y'know so I don't cry myself to sleep again, but angst is fine too, ig.

#+begin_quote
  Sirius runs away. Regulus starts to understand what it means to be a Black, and he isn't sure if he wants to be a part of that definition either."It happened in an instant.One moment, their Mother was screaming, magic whirling around her in a sort of destructive tornado, and the next moment his brother was out of the house. Suddenly there was no defiant voice to match the pure rage-- only a small click of a window latch and he was gone, venturing into the cold night and leaving the house ringing with an unfamiliar silence.He hadn't looked back, not once."
