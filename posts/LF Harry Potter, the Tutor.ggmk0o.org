The title says it all!

We saw Harry briefly shine with the DA in canon - and I want more.

Please rec fics in which Harry (preferably) finds himself in the role of a teacher - it can be helping someone with homework (if it's not a one-off), leading or helping organize a student's club, or even being a professor or assistant professor. What I'd like to see is the MC embracing the role and be an uplifting influence - inspiring and educational.

Examples:Professor Potter - linkffn(11141124)Students' Club; tutoring Dudley - linkao3(4629198)Professor Potter linkffn(10695216)

Crossovers are welcome, explicit s.mut and explicit M/M are not.

  Sequel to Fate's Gamble. Harry has finished with his original world (aside from a few visits) and now it's time to follow through on his promise to Fate to set right another world that her meddling didn't have quite the same effect as in his own. Summoned to fight Voldemort once more, Harry decides to have some fun while he's there. This is fan fiction, I only own the plot.

** Let's see what I have

Crafting Magic - linkffn(13256217) - Harry goes about and brings the arts to Hogwarts.

Head Boy Potter - linkffn(10942945) - Harry goes about being Head Boy and stopping bullying.

Harry the Hufflepuff - linkffn(6466185) - A fun take on Harry being an inspiring and educational figure all in the name of lazyness. It has several sequals.

Teaching at Hogwarts - linkffn(7770261) - A decent fic not the best fic but not terrible.

Well I hope you enjoy these, I wish I had more too offer.

  Magic is more than just waving a stick and saying fancy words. Magic is about life and art. Magic is about the people one chooses to interact with. An artistic Harry Potter decides to live up to his last name and begins to craft some wonderful pottery and ceramic creations. At age 11, he discovers that not only is his work magical but so is he!

  Harry as head boy cracks down on bullying and decides that he's going to help improve the relations between the houses. The first years happen to find a special place in his heart though as he helps them with their first year. A series of one-shots.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.
