Dumbledore is a hard character to get right, I think, and so he comes off as 2D a lot of the time. Either 'bwahaha I'm evil and controlling but the sheeple love me cuz I killed a guy in ww2' or 'half senile grandfatherly baffoon who "/really/ does regret things, Harry!"'

I'm tired of that shit. Link me your favorite Dumbledores- whether he's a bad guy, a good guy, or (my personal favorite) somewhat in-between.

Note: I'm not wanting Dumbledore in a specific position in the story, I wanna clarify. I don't care who the main character is- Harry, Ron, Dumbledore, hell even Snape. So long as Dumbledore is a somewhat-major character I'm down.


** Linkffn(12713828) by [[/u/Taure][u/Taure]]. Dumbledore in VP world is a masterstroke. Especially the last chapter. Its a fem!Harry fic so it may not be your cup of tea.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequenes of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** He's very good in the Weasley Girl stories, where he is definitely a good guy. Especially in the second story, Secrets of the Past, he's a little more involved in the plot than in canon... he's still conveniently not available for the big confrontation so the kids have to step up themselves. but it's a lot clearer that he does a lot of things behind the scenes. linkao3(3721921; 3793561)

He's also good in Harry Potter and the Natural 20. That fic plays up his eccentricities a lot more; he seems to enjoy just messing with people by going off on absurd tangents and not taking things very seriously.

** Linkffn(Stages of Hope) definitely. Granted, he's an AU Dumbles, but he doesn't come off as either evil or blatantly ineffective. On a slightly unrelated side note, Hiruzen Sarutobi often gets the Dumbledore treatment. I think it's interesting how the “old mentor figure trope” can become so skewed in fanon.

*** I think the problem with Dumbledore and Sarutobi is that they wield a great deal of power. Yoda was a good fit for the "old wise mentor" trope because while he was powerful and knowledgeable in the force, he was in exile on a backwater planet, living in hiding.

Dumbledore and Sarutobi both still wield significant political as well as personal power at the time the boy heroes are suffering, and so it's very logical for fanfic writers to ask the question "What were you doing with all your power while the protagonist was suffering?". It does reflect badly on Dumbledore that he has to rely on people like Mrs Figg and Mundungus, people who seem more like hindrances than helps. That he seemingly couldn't think of a way to get two powerless muggles to at least treat Harry with the bare minimum of decency, if not love or worse was unaware of the details of Harry's childhood. It reflects badly on Sarutobi that other Jinchuuriki were given people to raise and train them, while Naruto was seemingly left to wander around and get neglected and even sometimes abused.

While Luke had humble origins, they were never abusive. He didn't live in suffering until he met Yoda, he had a pretty decent life. So Yoda isn't interrogated the same way in fanon. As my own side not, the Fantastic Beasts movies are trashing Dumbles' character even more IMHO, because he's supposed to be in the prime of his life and not yet having achieved the crowning achievement of defeating Grindelwald and yet here he is using Newt like a catspaw. It seems he was never very heroic, even in his own epic story.

  Canon Divergence AU  Dumbledore raises Harry from the age of four after the Dursleys are found to be unfit guardians. They live in relative isolation, away from the pressures and dangers of the wizarding world, until Harry turns eleven. Then they return to Hogwarts together in the role of headmaster and student.Nothing has changed except for Harry and Dumbledore and what they mean to each other. And that changes everything.

And i think [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/umbrus-shade-the-incredibly-annoyed-ravenclaw-harry-potter-si.48980/]] has got a nice portrayal of him.

linkffn(7578572) does him quite well, i think the closest one to canon that there is - a bit extravagant and quirky but still powerful and somewhat influential. And he does try to explain why he left him with the Dursleys - maybe not the best and most elaborate fasion, but at least there is some reasoning behind it.
