While a long time fan it is only about a year since I became acquainted with fan fiction and I am constantly surprised at the hate, rage, vitriol and judgemental condescension that seems to pour in to any thread raising a question regarding one ship or another.

I don't care that you love Dramoine or think Remus and Sirius belonged together.

If I see an interesting question about my OTP I'll happily offer my 2 cents and read the opinions of others but soon enough the thread fills up with people hating all over it.

I get people are passionately invested in their ships but me loving one doesn't prevent you loving another so...

I guess I'm just flummoxed. Why are people not content to love their pairing without feeling the need to tear down the choices of others?

What's the social imperative at work here?

It's not like sooner or later a clear shipping Victor will emerge so why does it seem every body expects you to justify your ship the second you express a preference?

*** This. There will always be haters. Fanfiction isn't some magical(heh) territory where its protected from those who have an open dislike of certain things even if its not pairings. You could present the best basketball team in the world with the best people of the highest integrity who you think no one could possibly hate on but someone will find something to hate on. It shouldn't be surprising to anyone who's lived on this planet for longer then 15-20 years. Differing opinions on things will always be something that occurs. And it makes for interesting discussion for those who are able to and rage/hate talk for those who aren't able to express their thoughts in the right way.

But I confess myself genuinely disappointed that we cannot learn to respect those differences. Even when they are fictional.

I find it sad that we seem so determined to focus on what divides us from one another rather than what unites us, even here.

*** Yes, it's actually very much like rivalries between sporting teams and their fans. Like, there's no genuine reason for me to dislike Manchester United supporters other than that they support an opposing side, yet every time I see one, I have to physically restrain myself from punching them.

Similarly, hardcore shippers feel like they're part of a team or a collective of some kind, and dislike other ships for no other real reason than that they're another team.

** u/philosophize:
#+begin_quote
  Because plot is more important.
#+end_quote

Plot may be more important than any particular relationship, but it isn't more important than characters because without interesting characters that readers can care about, they won't care much about the plot and what happens to them.

Of course, the relationships (romantic and otherwise) are key to developing interesting characters that people care about. Some people may get rather myopic about which romantic relationships they're willing to accept, but that seems to be true across pretty much all media.

In fanfiction, though, /all/ different possibilities are explored to varying degrees, not just the ones which corporations and original authors find appropriate. This allows people to become much more emotionally invested in the new versions of characters - versions that they find more interesting, relatable, or whatever, based on the particular set of relationships (again, romantic and otherwise). It's no longer simply in their heads, it's out there on the screen, and they can talk to other, like-minded fans, thus reinforcing their position.

And the more emotionally invested people get, the more any disagreement - never mind criticism - will be perceived as a personal attack. Again, I think you'll be able to find similar things in all media (look at how passionate people get about "Han Shot First" - it's not romance, but it /is/ about the essential nature of the character, which romantic entanglements also deeply affect), but fanfiction is (obviously) far closer to the fans, thus allowing any problems to grow a lot stronger.

*** Fair enough, but my question stands.

This is a genuine question so please don't read it with a hostile tone, just a dry academic one; So because you, personally, are against the idea of Harry/Lupin or Snape/Granger do you feel its okay to criticise/judge/deride others who don't share your view?

Because that is what I am asking - I understand peoples' emotional investment in their ship. What I do not (but am seeking to) understand is why some individuals feel the need to try and enforce their POV regarding particular ships (or categories of) though derision and condescension and simple meanness.

For example, in a recent thread an OP asked why proponents of two particular ships felt connected to those pairs. A perfectly reasonable question.

Early on the thread was interesting and full of genuine responses regarding why people bonded to the OTP they did, but very quickly I found the thread subject to a lot of response from people who began their posts by identifying themselves as NOT shipping the pairs in question before saying something like "IMO its because" or "from what I can see" or "from the outside it looks" and then providing a response which belittled or demeaned or devalued the ships in question.

I confess my self confused and irritated. For a start, these responses don't address the question which was specifically addressed to fans of those pairs. The OP had already confessed to not being a fan himself/herself and was trying to understand those who are.

These responses *cannot* by definition answer the OPs question because the respondents themselves don't know the answer. The responses therefore are only to demean/rile/upset or attempt to belittle the genuine proponents of the pairs in question.

My intent here is trying to understand that mentality.

Perhaps I am wearing rose coloured glasses but I really want to part of a community that is trying to be less divided rather than one trying to dig all this ultimately unimportant trenches deeper.

If you really want outrageous ships, try Harry/Lily(Evans) or Lily/Giant Squid.

As to the age old question whom Harry should be paired with, I think canon Harry should definitely go with Ginny, but in fanfics, I'm fine with Hermione, Luna, Fleur, Daphne, Astoria, or even Bellatrix Black(not Lestrange).

For example, Snape/Hermione. I, personally, dislike Snape. I find him to be an obsessed man-child who can't let go of a grudge against a dead man. Were I any less openminded/apathetic about other pairings, I might be rather confused and offended that people would pair Snape with Hermione in an attempt to make him look more personable and redeemable when I personally think he can't be such.

** It's not contentious when it is removed from the realm of canon. Meaning people don't care if it's in fanfiction or whatnot. People can write whatever they wish. When it becomes a problem is when fanon shippers proclaim their superiority over canon by saying that their ship should have happened, instead of the canon ship, and then go on to blind themselves. Frequently this devolves into character bashing (to give a few examples, Harry/Hermione shippers bashing on Ginny and Ron, Snape/Lily shippers bashing on James, Dumbledore and even Lily in some cases), just to prove that their ship is better than the canon.

As a fairly staunch canon shipper myself I have no problem with ships such as Ginny/Luna etc. Because fans of the more minor fanon ships do not have the sense of entitlement that major fanon ships such as Harry/Hermione and Snape/Lily have. An entitlement which is born out of there actually being a chance of that particular ship happening. I mean, no one actually says that Harry/Pansy "should have happened". But there are people who enjoy it and write it.

And you can also add in the moral element too. I strongly believe that teacher/student relationships are unacceptable, and the vast majority of the British public share my opinion. As Snape/Hermione is a teacher/student relationship, you can expect a lot of backlash from the fandom.

And of course there is also the projection onto a favourite character. People who identify with Ron are more likely to defend Ron/Hermione at all costs, because it's about him "winning" the girl, after everything he has been through. People who identify with Hermione may also do that, but they may also bash on Ron for being "stupid" (see what I wrote on character bashing above).

So three aspects fuel the shipping wars: canon vs fanon entitlement, morality, and projection onto your character.

*** Well said. I mostly stick to canon ships though I'm open to other ships if it's a realistic AU. I just don't get the dislike and hatred some people have for shippings they don't like. It's even worse if writers use this in their stories to their own detriment. One thing I have found is that shipping fics that are bashing characters tend to have other serious problems as well. The bashing and hate may well be a symptom of general lack of characterization and writing skills.

**** I wasn't talking about canon vs fanon specifically. I was talking about a particular strain of fanon shippers, particularly present in H/Hr and Snily, which argues that their ship is the best, had the most evidence, and that the characters stepping in the way of that ship are unworthy. Basically, what they try and do is argue with the canon while ignoring canon itself.

What I said sounds paradoxical, but when you see people saying 100% fanon stuff such as that Ron is moronic and a coward, that Ginny is a gold-digger fangirling bitch, that Molly hatched up a secret plot to use love potions on Harry, or that James "stole" Lily from Snape, or that Lily was not a good friend to Snape, and then try and elevate it to the level of canon, you understand why there's such a backlash. So no, it doesn't cut both ways. What virtually all canon shippers are against is not fanon shipping as a whole, but fanon that gets passed as canon.

However, I still don't think it gives "Canonites" (nor the other parties) the right to attack, demean, belittle or insult one another.

That is my primary thrust here.

Not who is on solid ground regarding the source material. Not whether trying to usurp Canon with Fanon is acceptable.

Reading all the responses from the various forums I posed this question in my general (though as yet statistically unproven) impression is the vast majority of people, from all facets of the fandom don't care how people choose to engage with the material. Like yourself they may find it grinds their gears when people throw Canon to the dog or when the reverse is true & their beloved head canon is blugeoned by a "Canon-nazi", but most look for a measured and fitting response or just keep scrolling. It seems a vocal minority however who use these exchanges as a chance to insult, bully and demean their "opposition" and I don't think that is okay. I don't understand why we as a community shrug our collective shoulders and put it down to people being arseholes instead of saying "No, This behaviour is not acceptable".

****** I think actually one can put it down to trolls just being trolls. For specific examples, I remember back in December when there was a "wank" (that basically means drama in fandom terminology), where on Tumblr a troll posted a YUUUGE manifesto (and I say YUUUGE) against people who shipped Harry/Draco or Remus/Sirius (I'm sure there were others too). Why? Because apparently, it went against their "Christian beliefs". They then proceeded to condemn all of those people to hell and say that they needed to turn back to Jesus Christ. I think they were a canon shipper, but I'm not sure.

There will always be trolls on the Internet, no matter what. This is not just a fandom problem, you see it also in the comments of news articles.

And besides of that, there will always be debates, sometimes heated, between shippers, particularly between canon and fanon shippers. That doesn't mean we're going to start launching nuclear bombs at each other.

Had this person (or persons) chosen simply write this blog and post it somewhere I would say "Okay, they are merely exercising their right to express an opinion. People seeking others who share or take an interest in this opinion will be able to find it".

Except the author /didn't/ do that. They deliberately sought to berate, chastise and castigate and /tagged/ their very targets in order to be sure their message was forced home.

Does anyone actually /believe/ a rant designed to condemn would win people over or is it really just an excuse to be hateful and expect it to be tolerated? If anyone should understand that trying to covert people by the sword is ineffective you would think it is the Christian community.

/"You have not converted a man because you have silenced him."/ (John Morely, 1st Viscount Morely of Blackburn)

Trolls are entitled to hold an opinion. They are entitled to express it. But no one regardless of their status as "troll" or not should be tolerated in hate speech and derision /within the broader community./

You have a right to free speech. That does not trump everyone else right to a safe place.

I guess what I mean is, yes, there will always *BE* trolls, but instead of biting, of taking the bait and being incited to engage with their nastiness we should refrain from "feeding" them. If we don't neither side will gain ground but plenty of people will be made angry, or scared or sickened or otherwise upset.

Which was ridiculous, because the choice was never anybody but JKR's to make, but most of us were fairly young and can't be held legally responsible for our actions. Anyway, I think that tone has never quite left the fandom.

This could apply to almost anyone in the series. There's nothing in here that's exclusive to Hermione or Severus.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione secretly suspected that Dumbledore's death was a coup d'grace on Severus' part and there was more to it.
#+end_quote

This is directly contradicted by canon. In HBP's "The Phoenix Lament," Hermione apologises to Harry for allowing Snape to get past her. There is absolutely no indication that she possess the omniscient hindsight you've given her here.

#+begin_quote
  On his behalf, Lily Evans was a kind, clever, brave Gryffindor. Ticks on all 3 for Hermione.

That's an incredibly thin pretext. She also had a crush on Gilderoy Lockhart, said Cedric Diggory was handsome, and snogged Cormac McLaggen. Does that mean she's should have ended up with a blond?

I think the most compelling evidence against the pairing is that Hermione was "horrified" at hearing Harry say that Snape called Lily a Mudblood. Hr/S also reeks of paedophilia.

I'm afraid I very much don't see the difference between Head Canon and Fanon (which seems only to be shared head canon)

Besides which, if I am asked why *I* like a pairing or ship than surely a subjective response is called for?

Furthermore, I am not saying people are hating on my opinion (and I could give a tinker's cuss if they do) I meant they were pouring scorn upon the whole thread and pairs in question.

Oookay I see... we are having two totally different discussions here. I have NEVER suggested my pairing fits canon. Severus dies for goodness sake and she marries Ron so being canonical is a non-starter.

My problem with the responses I am taking exception to is that they DON'T and CAN'T answer the OPs actual question which was specifically directed toward people who shipped H/Sn and Sn/Hr, he asked a subjective question - why do you people like this?

The thread subject to a lot of response from people who began their posts by identifying themselves as NOT shipping the pairs in question before saying something like "IMO its because" or "from what I can see" or "from the outside it looks" and then providing a response which belittled or demeaned or devalued the ships in question by implying the people who chose them disregard or don't understand the source material.

My point here is, those responses don't answer the question posed, and are unlikely to change the minds of people who DO like these pairings. So if not to engender discord *what purpose do they serve* and if they *are* intended to create an argument I would like to understand why.

*But since you're asking why someone doesn't like Hr/S, I'll respond to your original post*

I'm not. I couldn't care less why Joe Bloggs doesn't find Snanger appealing. There are a myriad reasons why what works for one just grosses out another.

My question is why people who have zero investment in a ship feel like commentating upon it, and why this commentary is so often diminutive.

I had been going to continue addressing your reply but see the rest of it has nothing to do with what I am trying to understand.

You don't like Snape Granger and don't share how I view the material. I get it and I don't care we disagree.

See how easy that is. You disagree with me and I... couldn't care less, and continue having no interest in and nothing to say regarding whoever your favourite pair is.

However I will say you are making my point by choosing NOT to respond to the actual question I have posted instead climbing onto a soapbox to decry my choice of pair and imply I am a child sex offender.

***** Head canon/ Fanon = potato/potahto and I fail to see its relevance here

<I certainly agree with this. No one should take you to task for simply stating your opinion. My issue was that you presented your preference as plausible:

'I think I just find it a plausible match based upon character traits.'>

Given this relationship is by definition going to have to be AU I stand by claim that based upon my reading of their characters (which no doubt differs from your own) I find this pairing plausible. I do not expect you to.

<The other instances that I've already listed are more of the same canon interpretations that you brought up in defense of the pairing.>

Yes of course they are because canon informs Head canon.

<I have NEVER suggested my pairing fits canon.

'Fair enough, but listing traits that you believe the canon characters have in common is quite close to this.'>

And what bearing does that have *on the question as asked* which had NOTHING WHATSOEVER to do with any specified pair at all.

<he asked a subjective question - why do you people like this?

'Yes, and if the answer had just been, "I like it because it appeals to me," then that's unimpeachable. The comparison of canon personalities is what piqued my interest.">

And it would have been an extremely dull and uninformative, repetitive and ultimately useless response to the question. Providing the background Head canon/fanon/interpretation of the text which lead to the development of this preference seemed a far more interesting answer and one of more value to the person posing the question. Which was posed in another thread and *continues to have no relevance to the question I asked here*, in this thread which you still seem to be completely missing.

<So if not to engender discord what purpose do they serve and if they are intended to create an argument I would like to understand why.

"I most definitely did not want to start an argument. If someone makes a claim that two characters share motivations/interests/personality traits, though, they'll need to defend them with more than fanon as that is very subjective.">

Clearly you did or you wouldn't have jumped threads in order to continue railing at me and refusing to answer the question as posed HERE in this thread.

More over. WHY? Why should I or anyone have to defend their interpretation and subjective response. Who are you, or anyone for that matter to require I (or anyone else) justify my interpretation and response to this. That compulsion to try and make people accountable is what I am trying to understand through the ACTUAL question posed by this thread. NOT what you seem so determined to try and make this conversation about, which is my preference of OTP.

<Why?

"I said that the pairing has a certain undesirable flavour to it, not the people who ship it.">

The implication remains. Moreover, you haven't answered the question.

I am not sure if you simply don't understand what or why I am asking - it isn't in the least about my preferences or yours - or if you are the exact example of what my original post was about. In which case I can only assume the answer is that you don't know yourself why you are choosing to engage in this behaviour the way you are.

I will leave this conversation at that, I hope you have a great day.

****** Sorry to pop in on a discussion you seem to want to be over, but it was the most interesting set of comments in this post, not in the least because of the reference to the previous thread.

It seems to me you both had some good points, however Judy, as this post and the (Harry or Hermione)/Snape thread are discussion threads, you need to expect your reasoning will be dissected, agreed with, or disagreed with. As a self proclaimed Hr/S shipper, when you give reasons why you think the ship is plausible due to canon, you bet your bottom dollar someone will come along and pick apart your arguments to try to show their side. Discussion threads are there for that purpose, to discuss -- not to just throw out your opinion and let it sit there uncontested.

And while this comment thread has gone off topic, discussions tend to be like that --they may start at one point and end at another. That this commenter referred back to a previous thread that spawned this post makes it actually well thought out as far as many discussions go. I personally would be pleased that someone cared enough about my post(s) to engage in a spirited discussion.

******* I don't mind being disagreed with or vigorous debate. Primarily because I believe having your view challenged is the best way to grow and learn.

What I object to is the way many posters choose to speak about other people's viewpoints in the diminutive. Simply because we cannot agree does not mean I am lesser than the person I am disagreeing with nor is the reverse true.

In this thread my largest bone of contention is simply bad manners - address the question at hand or please save your breath because how can we have worthwhile discussion or debate if every conversation is constantly hijacked.

I felt my question in this thread was a valid one and I am truly trying to understand the viewpoint and desired outcome of the people who do undercut the preferences/choices expressed by others.

I also recognised the previous thread and the conversation therein was not the appropriate place - I didn't wish to drive the conversation away from the topic of interest to the OP.

I agree [[/u/MacsenWledig][u/MacsenWledig]] made some excellent points and having had a peek at his/her comment history I can see he/she is generally precise and well informed. However when push came to shove they inevitably fell back on personal opinion - as seen in the paedophilia comment . The very thing they had first taken exception to in my early responses to the original threads question.

Over and over in this thread people who did come to offer an answer to the question as posed said variations of the same thing. People react so strongly because they care so much/are so invested in their own preferences.

Discussion is wonderful. Bullying is not. Thoughtless minimisation or worse deliberate degradation of something others care about is not. THAT is my beef in all of this. I'm a tough old bird and I am more than equipped to tell someone to rack off if I ever felt genuinely attacked or threatened. However, many Redditors do not have the same life experience and emotional resources I do. They deserve a safe place to engage without being spoken down to.

That is the crux of my issue.

** Because plot is more important. Stories tend to be way better when the author isn't focused on trying to shoehorn in a random relationship. People get tunnel-vision when it comes to it, and they lose sight of what really matters, and that's quality fiction. But, when you have a nonsensical pairings (I'm sure mentioning Hermione/Snape here will get this downvoted to -100), you lose the feel of the HP universe and a story ends up as just two characters who bear no resemblance to their canon counterparts other than their names, and no meaningful plot.

**** However, the people writing fanfiction are generally not professional writers and even if they are they wouldn't go with something that would be in need of excuses and explanation at every corner. Your normal amateur writer is bound to loose focus eventually if he has to force his desired pairings into a story, especially if they want to stay "close" to canon in other aspects.

Hence, pairings like Harry/Draco or Hermione/Snape have less good fics in general because you need exceptional storytelling skills to pull them off.

***** Actually, no, I don't agree that an amateur writer would lose focus on the story by writing the ship. Because for many people, the reason for writing the story /is/ the pairing and the chemistry they see in it. Tell them to stop paying so much attention to the pairing, and they'll stop writing. That might suit some of the people here who hate that particular ship, but love of a pairing is as good a reason as any to write fanfic. It doesn't mean /I'll/ read it, but hey, somebody might.

And a romance plot is a plot. It's not necessarily a complex or original plot, but that very limitation is one way for amateur writers to get their start. And let's be real here, fanfic is not a masterclass in fiction writing. Which is not to deny the presence of some incredibly talented writers in fandom. But it should come as no surprise that most hobby writers are mediocre. They're not aiming for publication or awards, and besides, publication is no insurance against mediocrity.

In any case, I think people who dislike certain ships and don't read widely in them or read them at all (you may or may not be one of those people, but I've no idea since I don't know what you read) aren't the people who get to say which fics are good. I don't like the horror genre much, and no one would ever think of asking me to recommend good horror novels.

A lot of fic is written for aficionados of a certain thing - a pairing, a particular kind of AU, a kink, a trope - and more of it tends to be written the more of a reception it gets. That's not a value judgment one way or another. But those stories exist /only/ because the writer is interested in that compelling aspect, not because they're trying to demonstrate their credentials as a Great Writer. You may not get why - you may think your personal favorite thing is clearly superior in every way to that stupid popular thing over there - but then it's up to you to stir up interest in your favorite and persuade other people to champion it and write for it.

** I have only recently started reading Harry Potter fanfictions and one of the things that I found surprising was not the large variety of "shipping" but the fact that many authors seem to do it very well. In the original stories by JK Rowling, I felt Harry and Hermione were much more suited for each other than Harry and Ginny and I could feel Rowling's forceful hand bringing Harry and Ginny together. But some of the fanfictions I have read have shown much better Harry/Ginny pairings. And Harry/Luna. And Harry/Daphne. Ad infinitum.

For me, all those Harrys are different people. And each of those Harrys could be involved with someone different. It's up to the author to sell the pairing and if he/she does it well, that's all the justification that's needed for the pairing to occur.

***** Thank-you for that. I appreciate you taking the time to clarify.

I accept your meaning that it is your assessment that people's attachment to their OTPs is what leads to contentiousness. I agree it is a significant contributing factor, though not the sole contributor.

I concur the resultant behaviour is unpleasant and yields no tangible results (which is by definition a stupid course of action).

I do not accept the leap that therefore all OTP is stupid, simply because all people who engage with an OTP do not adopt the "I'm right and you're wrong mindset"

In fact based on the responses here and in other forums where I have posed this question out of interest it seems the majority of people express a preference for a particular pairing (whether or not that label it an OTP) but they also go out of their way in their responses to say others should be entitled to their own preferences.

I am coming to the conclusion (perhaps erroneously, I admit I am not yet certain on this point) that it is only an extremely vocal minority who are indulging in anti-social behaviour. Short of throwing up my hands and saying "well some people are just arseholes" I am still not sure I understand what makes those behaviours their choice which is what I am seeking to do.

Opinions are opinions - we all have them. I'm thoroughly opinionated. However, I don't accept that simply because someone holds an opinion gives them a right to express it in such a fashion as to demean or belittle those people who do not share it. I don't understand why those of us who do "play nice" with one another simply accept people "pissing in our pockets" instead of saying "No, that is unacceptable."

Regarding this: /"However, your choice of language implies that any one who thinks otherwise is "stupid" and wrong. Is that what you intended to imply? If so, why? Why do you want to tell other fans you think they are stupid?"/

I (now) understand and concede your initial point, however what I intended with this question was /not/ to ask you to justify why you felt OTPs were stupid (or their proponents) but rather to point out through the use of such a negative word as "Stupid" the likelihood is high that people who do not share your opinion will feel attacked and insulted leading to squabbles and pointless nastiness.

In reference to:

/"What I think you are attempting to articulate is that your preferences lie with Canon only pairing or canon compliant stories"/ It was not criticism or query on your preferences (which are of course entirely your own). I have always been taught the best way to be clear you understand instructions or in this case someone's argument is to repeat back to them your understanding of what they had just said. This was my attempt to be sure I understood your intended point in your remarks about "There's canon pairing and then there's everything else. There is no OTP".

Clearly at that time I /didn't/ have a grasp of what your point was, so again, thank-you for taking the time to respond with a clarification. It really does help my understanding.
