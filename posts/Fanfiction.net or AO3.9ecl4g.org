Which do HP fans tend to prefer? Why?

So I'm aware that this fandom is pretty old compared to the other popular fandoms today. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm under the impression that most of the original, older fics had their start on fanfiction.net

See, I only started reading fanfic in 2015 when I was 14. I found AO3 first by searching the internet for a specific pairing and then being suggested the archive. (I knew fanfic existed I just had never pursued it before, thus leading me to using Google rather than a specific website)

I avoid fanfiction.net because it's just not fun to navigate on mobile imo. And I was confused by the layout at first. I wonder if I'm missing out.

Personally, I love AO3: the users, the works and the layout. But I still do wonder, especially when it comes to such a well developed fandom like this with such an expansive library of fics.


** Honestly, both are good to me- though I tend to treat AO3 as a site for smut, Fanfiction.net for everything else.

You are missing out I'd say on a good many stories that are exclusive to Fanfiction.net I'd say, but it isn't as easy to find stories I admit- the tagging system of AO3 is superior mostly.

*** Haha yeah I suppose there is a lot of that on AO3, although if ff.net is better for that then perhaps I should be giving the site more of a try. I'm not really into smut.

Yeah, the filter options on ff confused me and still kinda do, it would be cool if they updated them because it's one of the main reasons I don't use it

** In my limited experience (I crossposted 3 of my stories there this week), Archive yields more kudos and reviews/100 views, but FFN has simply a far larger reader base. If you write rare pairings/characters, it is easy to get swept under the rug by the flood of other stories, but it's also easier to get thousands of views there. I began writing a year ago and just my two most popular stories (both still ongoing) have gotten 200k views.

The FFN app is vastly superior to the Ao3 app (which really sucks) and even beats FFN in browser view since, for example, characters get sorted by their popularity.

There are many great stories far below 1000 favs or follows on FFN, so don't discount them. If anything, nearly all of the very popular stories on FFN are shite or, at the very least, start out promising but then take a turn for the worse, like Delenda Est with the return to the future, or Rune Stone Path with the inclusion of Daphne Greengrass.

** From the perspective of posting fics, I much prefer FF.Net. It's just a lot more convenient to upload a doc than to have to copy/paste text into an editor and then fiddle around with it because the formatting has gone weird. It's also a lot easier to make changes to previous chapters on FF.Net, as you can just upload the new doc and switch the old one out for the new one. On AO3 you have to go into the text editor and manually edit in your changes.

Also you get a lot more reviews on FF.Net. AO3 readers tend to leave kudos and leave it at that, only rarely adding comments.

You can literally copy-paste from the FFN doc editor (or G-Drive) to the Ao3 "post new story/chapter" tab if you set it to "Rich text" instead of HTML. I crossposted 3 of my stories this week and spent more time wondering how to tag it than actually copying the content.

And there are still some more specialized archives around, though many of the smaller ones are being imported to Ao3 through the Open Doors project. Check out fanficauthors.net (which is multi-fandom, but has plenty of HP stories.)

Better updated, and actually updated. Submitting a fic is way easier, and I can use html/css to fix it. Reviewing, and replying to reviews is easier. I just like the level of control I have over my own content.

The search is better, I like the warnings, and tagging. The staff at Ao3 is very responsive, and they warn you for downtime, you can report stories easier, and they actually get back to you.

They have more serious, and long stories. There's some that have been kicked of for different reasons and have been moved to ao3, tthat have more "adult content". But at least both sites are better than livejournal.

Although for Fantastic Beasts, ao3 is better.

** Another thing I like on Ao3 is the bookmark search - you can see people's comments and tags on stories they bookmark, which is sometimes more useful than the author's summary and tags. Ffn just gives you the numbers, or lists someone's favorites with no commentary.

** For me, AO3 is great for searching new fics comparatively to FFN but you find better things asking recs in a preexisting community like a subreddit (ex: [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] ).

.

Otherwise, it really depends how you like to read fics and for that you have a few options:

-FFN web, which is very simple and minimalist, both on computer and mobile

-FFN app, which I use and find pretty good, if a bit buggy in parts

-AO3 web, FFN in more complex

-another website like Sufficient Velocity, SpaceBattles, SIYE or DLP

-a third party app, try not to use them as a lot don't transmit to the website the author uses the number of readers, of favs, etc...

** I prefer FF.net because it's the first that I knew. And in general has more complex and mature stories than Ao3. FF.net has many defects like you can't really search a story as freely as in AO3 but at least it doesn't have people blogging their opinions like it was Tumblr on the 4 million tags that a common fic has there.

Unless I really like the pairing or the summary is Really good. Tags like these make me avoid the fic entirely

** I prefer AO3 because the tags make it really easy to tell which romance or slash fics are story based and which are smut. Almost every one of my favorite fics is /technically/ a romance, but it's very background to the central story (just like cannon).

***** I was more thinking comparatively, I started reading when I was 15 and people have been saying they've been reading since 2004... I was born in the year 2000. That's a decade difference even if I began reading at 13/14. Note that I didn't say everyone on the thread, just "others".

** In general, I read and write exclusively on ffnet and only end up on AO3 when following specific recommendation links. But I write and read gen, and from the general tone of responses AO3 is more pairing-focused, so it makes sense.

**** I just had a play with it today. When a story has more then one chapter and you press "next chapter" it goes to the nexh chapter and skips the header information (on mobile) which I didn't realize before as I had only looked at it on PC.

The other thing I like about FF.net is that you can download stories and read them offline (well on the unofficial app). Is this possible on ao3?
