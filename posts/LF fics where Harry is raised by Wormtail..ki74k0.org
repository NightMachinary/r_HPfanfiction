** Survival.

It beat through his brain like a mantra, one word on repeat, always there, always running through his thoughts. It ran as he ran, through the dark alleyways, and open streets. He paused, and it didn't.

Survival.

He knew what was going to happen, could see it whenever he closed his eyes. Sirius would be out for blood, and Remus wouldn't be far behind him. He hadn't thought that through, hadn't covered his tracks as well as he could have.

Hadn't covered them at all, to be quite honest. He'd been too caught up in the thought of being the hero, the one to give the Dark Lord what he wanted above all else.

There was no cost that was too great when it came to securing the future. That was the one lesson his father had taught him that was worth anything at all. If you weren't ready to pay the cost of it in blood, then you didn't deserve to win, or even to live.

He paused for a moment, listening to the sounds of running footsteps, and raised his head to watch the oversized, shadowy shape moving down the street ahead of him.

People had seen the damage, the traces of the explosion in the air, but had no idea where it had come from. That meant that the house was still protected. That meant that one of the Potters lived, impossible thought that they may have seemed in the moment.

He still had time. Time enough, to cover his tracks.

If he didn't start now, then it was game over.

Sucking in his stomach, he entered one of the rat holes at the edge of the property in Godric's Hollow, a hole that had been left open for him to come and go with ease.

Standing on the carpet, he raised his head and sniffed the air as his claws worked loose a thread of lemon yellow from the carpet.

Impossible.

He could smell Harry, the scent already as familiar as his own.

Turning his head, he made a decision in the moment, and with a swift, decisive strike he bit through his own leg, removing any trace that he had ever called the Dark Lord his Master with a single, decisive stroke. He had a wand, and it would be as good of a story as any.

Survival.

It hurt, but a single limb was a small price to pay.

He watched those claws twitching as the limb lay there, took a deep breath and willed himself back to human.

He would survive, he knew this now. He would teach Harry to survive, too.

After all, if there were one thing that a rat was good at...

** That's one I haven't heard of! I've read a few where Harry is raised by Fenrir Greyback, though.
