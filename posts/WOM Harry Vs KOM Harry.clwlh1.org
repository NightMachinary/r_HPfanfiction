Who would win in a fight? Worthy of Magic Harry or Kaleidoscope of Magic Harry? This was just a thought that has been stuck in my head for a while now and I wanted to see what the community thought.

** Definitely WOM. I mean he transformed thevwhile if England into a ficking desert to test out survival of thie fittest.

He killed a werewolf, by accident.

Worthy of Magic deserves to be finished for the fans.
