No Weasley bashing, no OP Harry, Harry smarter or stronger then in canon is fine but I'd like for it to be believable, because he worked for it.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual. (Doesn't have to focus on a pairing).

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can be oneshot/drabbles/multichapter. Can be older or newer. Can be as Canon or as AU as possible. Would rather NOT have Cursed Child Compliant though.

Anyone can be the person that has memory loss/amnesia. It can be a major thing in the story or a minor thing in the story.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine.


** Daphne's Surprise had memory lose due to obliviation. But sadly it was never finished and I think the author took it down cause someone plagiarized it

** Lockhart actually went through with Harry and Ron's Chamber of Secrets obliviation in this.
