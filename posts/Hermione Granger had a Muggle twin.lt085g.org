Part of the reason she was so driven to learn magic was to not waste the gift she'd been given but not her sister, but another part... It wasn't until after the war that she finally completed her research.

  Dolores came awake with a start, but looking around she couldn't help but wonder if she was still suffering after-effects from being Stunned, as for some reason she was seeing /two/ of Potter's Mudblood whore!

  "Confused, Madam Umbridge?" one of them asked with a cold smile. "Let me introduce my twin sister, Antigone. You've probably never heard of her - I kept her a secret, even from my friends. After all, people like you or Malfoy would've done monstrous things to the Muggle twin of the best friend of the 'Boy-Who-Lived'. It's been terribly hard, these past few years, living apart from her, seeing her denied the wondrous world I was gifted by happenstance."

  "Fortunately," her grin widened, "I've found a solution, which is why you're here. I'm sure you'll be pleased to know that you'll /finally/ be correct about a Muggleborn stealing magic from a witch..."

There are two major directions I could see things going from here:

1. The ritual is pretty much a one-off, making use of the commonality between identical twins, so only other magical/Muggle or magical/Squib twin pairs can use it. Further story would probably center around Antigone Granger experiencing magic and trying to fit into the already-established social dynamics of her new peers, what happens to Umbridge if she survives the ritual, trying to keep what happened secret, and/or the fallout when it becomes known.
2. The ritual is more generally-applicable. Blood-purists now face one of their greatest fears - Muggleborn coming to steal their magic - but also have the ability to take magic from "unworthies" to give to their Squib children. That's already enough to spark a whole new wave of trouble, even if the ritual only works with recipients that /don't/ already have magic (and even if that's the case, it doesn't mean nobody would try to steal somebody else's power to add to their own, possibly with messy results).


** That would work perfectly as a way for the Ministry to remove the most dangerous criminals. If captured, their magic gets removed. It's reminding me of something else, but I can't exactly think of its name at the moment

** I could see it working as a nearly one-off relying on twins where one is magical and one isn't. At least that's how I would write it if I were to do so.

*** Not really. If you could actualy steal magic, then that would validate at least some of the pureblood propaganda. And Hermione trying to gift her twin magic would also validating pureblood bigotry - that magic means you're worth more.

Both aren't themes I would write.

**** True. I was thinking more about the fallout side of it, which vibed a bit like /Divided and Entwined/ and /The Marriage Law Revolution/, but you do tend to smash blood-purist dogma.

EDIT: My intent, possibly not conveyed effectively, was that Hermione was the one to discovered the method. Perhaps she was even inspired by her experiences to make the blood-purists' worst nightmares real - "You've been claiming this for years, why aren't you happy that I'm proving you right?".

I'm not sure I'd agree that it's validating the idea that magic makes you worth more, though. At least in Hermione's head in this prompt, she's thinking "Magic is an incredible gift, one you've abused terribly and don't deserve, so I'm giving it to my sister instead." Of course, the blood-purists /would/ take it as validation, but the thing about bigots and conspiracists is that everything is either taken as validation or denied/ignored.

**** For the first part, it would validate pureblood propaganda, but doesn't really change the fact that killing innocent muggleborns is wrong, right? Considering purebloods don't tend to be completely stomped in you fics, why would you not write this?

For the second part, why wouldn't a muggleborn witch want their muggle sibling to have magic if they like them? It's still a cool thing to have. It doesn't mean they are worth more after having magic, simply that magic is something valuable to have. Why would you avoid writing this?

***** I don't write stories where the pureblood propaganda is correct. A world where you can steal magic doesn't appeal to me, either.

Working dark magic to grant magic to your sibling? That level of fixation on magic doesn't appeal to me.

****** I'm curious why it doesn't appeal to you as a writer. I get it as a reader because of the types of stories that tend to be produced from these concepts, but as a writer you have control over the execution.

Also, why is it such a bad thing to work dark magic to give magic to a sibling? You're essentially gifting them with powerful tools that are extremely beneficial for anything they want to do.

******* I wouldn't write a story where there's a "Jewish conspiracy" or where the "Aryan race is superiour" bullshit is actually true, either.

And are you seriously asking me why working dark magic for personal/family gain is a bad thing?

******** The first two feel different to me because they use actual real life groups with historical connotations. I suppose the fact that you liken this to writing a story where pureblood propaganda is true is the difference between us that had me asking the question in the first place.

For the second part, yes, yes I am. For example, the idea of a story where Hermione works dark magic on people like Voldemort and Bellatrix to take their magic away and give it to someone else interests me.
