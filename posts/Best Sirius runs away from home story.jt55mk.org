There's alot of them what are your favorite?

It can be the whole story is about him running away and like the fall out from that.

Or that's a big part but not the full story.

Sirius Centric

More centered on friendship than romance

I'm fine with slash

no marauder x oc, no marauder x character who named dropped but not explored in canon like say Marlene McKinnon. No incest and no one x Bellatrix.

  It's the summer after fifth year, and Sirius has made himself scarce as usual. But then Remus catches a glimpse of him in Witch Weekly's special on the Black-Malfoy wedding. Something about that photo is very, very off... Turns out this is the summer Sirius runs away. Or tries to. Because the Blacks are not giving up on their heir without a fight.

  When Sirius ran away from home he went to live with the Potters, but before he made it there he wound up lost, alone, and hurt in Muggle London. With James out of the country, Peter stuck at home, and Remus trapped by the full moon, it's Lily Evans (who hates his guts) that Sirius is forced to turn to for shelter and more advice than he could have bargained for.
