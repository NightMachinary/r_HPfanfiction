In canon, the guy is incompetent to the point of ridiculousness, and most fics that do use him just follow suit, making him nothing more than an annoyance.

I'm looking for stories that actually use his character for something more than a bit of comedic relief. Obviously, those stories have to be somewhat AU for this to work.


** Lockhart in Prince of Slytherin is a very interesting take on this character.

  Formerly Defense for Two. Adopted from Perspicacity with permission. They thought Lockhart was a fraud. They were wrong; he was their guide into a world of danger, adventure, intrigue and other Unspeakable Things.

** link(11913447) probably the most AU, since Harry from the future and Lockhart have merged, but still.

link(13388022) Here, Lockhart is quite useful for Harry to manage his fame realistically.

** A Lockhart who has still subpart magical skills which must had been hard for him being in Ravenclaw and who does all the treasurous Obliviate he did in canon and is more skillful in treating fame and less comically incompetent would be nice to have

***** Yes. Best thing about it is his last wish, he wants her to publish the one book where he wrote down the truth about all his exploits. Like, the guy was a bastard, but man was he a respect-deserving bastard.

** In my fic linkffn(A Different Perspective by StellaStarMagic) Lockhart will play a bigger role and will definitely not be an incompetent buffoon like in canon, though, for obvious reasons, I can't spoil what his agenda is and what his role later will be. I'm currently back to writing the Year-Two-Finale, where what's going on with Lockhart will be revealed, and yeah. :o)

If the premise for my fic is something you would read, feel free to have a look, but know that Lockhart won't have a major role throughout the fic if that's what you are looking for. He will appear here and there though.

  When trying to stop his godfather from falling through the Veil of Death, Harry fell through with him. Death was none too pleased to see him this early in its realm, however, so he got another chance at life. Not as Harry though. His new life would be that of Rose Potter, Harry Potter's twin sister.
