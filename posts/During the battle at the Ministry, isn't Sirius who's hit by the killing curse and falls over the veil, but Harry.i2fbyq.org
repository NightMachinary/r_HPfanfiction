During the battle at the Ministry, isn't Sirius who's hit by the killing curse and falls over the veil, but Harry

I'd like to read a Fanfiction with the consequences. Or an AUs starring Harry beyond the veil or Sirius who's to deal with Harry's death and war (if he manages to escape from the Ministry). Thanks a lot!


** There's a fic where both Sirius and Harry fall through the veil. Idk if it's something that you would read but here:

  It was only one second. One second when Remus stared at the rigid body of his last best friend falling through the veil. One second when he heard James's son too late, when he wasn't fast enough to catch him. Then Harry ran through the veil.

** Well.. gotta point out that Sirius is neither hit with the killing curse (isnt the spell that hits Sirius described as red in the books?) And he doesnt fall over the veil either, but through it ;)

Despite my silly nitpicking, im interrested in this premise as well

*** The first that he manages to avoid yes, the second that hits him is described as a bright thing (At least in my native language). In English, the spell that hits him is also red?

**** He was hit by an unknown spell acording to the fandom wiki. And isn't people just die instantly when hit by Avada Kedavra? Sirius stumbled a little then fell into the Veil.

In the movie he was hit by a red colour spell, i think. Not sure what spell is that.
