**** Hmm... full on vampire is something I can help you out with.

linkffn(2737363) Twists of Fate is, in my opinion, one of the, if not /the/ best takes on vampire!Harry out there. Lupin raises him in this fic and Harry is wonderful snarky in it.

linkffn(2649475) Lord of the Night was in my "decent" folder, but I honestly can't remember the details of it. It has been a DLP forum recommendation, though.

At last, shameless self-bump: linkffn(The Bloodmoon Rises). My own story with 50/50 story-arcs covering Harry and Hermione.

  Voldemort had not only sent his Death Eaters to the Ministry, but vampires as well. Hermione and Harry fall to them and find themselves in new, undead lives. While Harry struggles to remain human, Hermione becomes what was believed dead long ago. She becomes a Countess, an heir to Dracula. Unfortunatly, there are no books on that.

**** Hm. It may be a bit more tongue in cheek than what you're wanting, but my favorite vampire!Harry fic is [[https://mirabellafic.dreamwidth.org/19848.html#cutid1][Harry Potter and the Inconvenient Condition]] It's a Drarry, which is why I asked about your feelings on slash but it's not one of those ones where Draco wakes up one day and is all sugary sweet and OOC. Hilarious one-shot

*Author's Summary:* Harry comes back from vacation with an inconvenient case of vampirism and must learn to cope with blood, Malfoy, and recalcitrant secretaries. And if that doesn't tell you everything about the plot you need to know, you haven't read enough badfic.

** Sorry, but what exactly is a half vampire? I mean... Vampires create more vampires through draining their blood, right? So you wouldn't pass it down by having babies. Is it something like Susan Rodriguez in the Dresden Files - bitten by a vampire, but not fully one until she bites a human?
