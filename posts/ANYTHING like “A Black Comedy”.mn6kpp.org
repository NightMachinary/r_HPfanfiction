I never see any good adult single Harrys that are funny. I just want an adult Harry living his best semi-crack life. Preferably no ships or romance. time or dimension travel is fine. Looking for comedy.


** *A Black Comedy* is in a class of its own. I never found anything as good as that one. Most post-Hogwarts fics are full of boring domestic stuff. *Weeb Adventures* is not too bad. Also check out Nonjon's other works.

** One of my favorite "adult Harry" fics is The Moon Looks Lovely Tonight. It's eventually a Harry/Draco ship but the focus of the story is more about Harry coping with adulthood in his own unique way.

** I would say Nonjon's brand of humour is unique unto itself. His "YOU WHAT?" Trilogy leaves me in stitches to this day.

For some high crack fun, try Dear Order: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3157478/1/Dear-Order]]

Other than that, JBern's Lie I've Lived is good for a chuckle if you like swearing and lad humour: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived]]

*** I've read “dear order“ sadly. The summery of “the lie I've lived“ is pretty vague. What's it about?

**** Basically James's memories end up in Harry's body post his death and after the dementor incident at the end of POS, Harry begins accessing those memories. The Sorting Hat becomes Harry's trusted guide and advisor and he is a foul-mouthed scrap of cloth that brings much of the potty humour and occasional gravitas to the proceedings. The one-two punch between Harry and the Sorting Hat is what makes the fic excellent imho.

The author also completely revamps the Triwizard tournament and makes it much more exciting. There are elements of Indie!Harry, but the story is a bit old and I felt those elements were handled well.

**** Basically Harry has James Potter's memories and is now a fusion of both. Named Harry James Potter in the Marauder's Map.

The Sorting Hat swears a lot, and is very present in the story.

When I read it, I felt Harry's anger at times, and so, was impressed by the author's ability to make the reader feel the story.

It's in First Person POV.
