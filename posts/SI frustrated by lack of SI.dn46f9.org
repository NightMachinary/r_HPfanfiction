"Ten /Inches/ of text? Why can't wizards just use meters like normal people?"


** No no no.

If you *really* want frustration, the wizards use pre-standardization imperial units. An inch is thee grains of barley.

What do you mean your ruler says it is something else? Let me conjure some Barley to prove my definition is correct.

*** Did you know that show sizes are done in barleycorns. Fun fact :D

** Because British haven't used SI units until they were more or less forced to it by EU (i.e., in 1970s and 1980s), and of course wizards are little bit behind Muggles.

What's more interesting how ridiculously small those assignments were: ten inches of text? That's slightly more than one Letter paper right (using US paper format, because it is measured in inches)? And everybody cries about it like they were forced to write PhD dissertation.

*** One page typed is a hell of a lot easier than filling ten inches of parchment using a quill.

**** Are you kidding? No one writes that small. One page typed is at least twice the text of one page handwritten.

***** It's not a matter of size, it's a matter of handwriting, particularly with a quill on parchment, being drastically more difficult than typing.

****** Okay, using a quill is tricky. But once you get the hang of it, the main difficulty is what to write. The content of the essay. Not the actual process of writing.

** Us brits still use miles on our road signs. 1760 yards in a mile, weird, but sure okay. Only time I really use yards is when I watch football, players always trying to steal a few more. Metres are better but when someone says they are 1.6m, I say cool, then convert that into feet. It's all very confusing.

*** I'm an American but the opposite, I use metric unless otherwise forced too (for other people mainly, although I've converted a couple of my friends).

Mind I'm good enough at mental math to do the conversions in my head without pause.
