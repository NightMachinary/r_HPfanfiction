*** Mostly Ron's attitude all the way up to Goblet of Fire. I just never enjoyed his character at all and think I would have enjoyed canon more if Harry and Hermione's friendship with Ron ended completely in GoF. I also think him ending up with Hermione is some Stockholm syndrome shit. Not that I care too much about pairings though.

Edit: Did you guys expect rational hate from a guy who made w thread asking fics featuring Harry murdering Ron?

***** Ron's attitude? The only problem I have with Ron in the whole series is GoF when he doesn't believe Harry (though thorough analyses have shown that it isn't completely unwarranted), and when he's a jerk to Hermione at the Yule Ball.

Ron's got a great attitude I think. He's been overshadowed his whole life by his brothers, and makes friends with the most famous kid in the country. But he's still super supportive and awesome to Harry and literally sacrifices himself to a giant violent chess game at the age of 12. Supports Harry in CoS when everyone thinks he's the heir of Slytherin. His friend gets the Ferrari of broomsticks when Ron's never even had his own new broom before, and he's not jealous at all, just like hey mate you're going to whoop Malfoy's ass on this! HE STANDS UP ON A BROKEN LEG TO TELL A DERANGED MASS MURDERER THAT HE'LL HAVE TO KILL HIM BEFORE HE CAN GET TO HARRY AT THE AGE OF 14. He also breaks Harry out of the Dursleys' house and lets him spend part of the summer at his house, even though he knew he'd get in trouble for it.

Ron doesn't have an attitude problem.

****** Well said! Though as for Ron's epic scene in Azkaban, the movie gave that line to Hermione instead. I'd say about 1 in 4 Harmony shippers I've spoken too point towards the Azkaban film for why they like H/Hr so much, and they don't tend to listen when I point out that Hermione basically stole Ron's thunder.

******* I like the smart girl getting the hero instead of the athletic one. I'd like Ron/Hermione more if canon hadn't messed up Ron so much. The brave kid who was ready to die for his friends vanished just so the plot could have some more angst in it.

I wish JKR had let Ron keep being the grounded, laid back hero, keeping Harry from angsting, Hermione from freaking out, and generally pulling the trio through the DH Farce. Or at least let him kill a couple Death Eaters to save his family and friends.

********** The years before? You mean the one moment of teenage angst and the horcrux manipulating him? He does far more in that time than you give him credit for, he follows Harry to two seperate Death Eater battles, supports him all through 5th and 6th year then leaves with him on the Horcrux hunt putting his entire family at risk when he has no reason to fight (pureblood, unlike Hermione and Harry he could just move on with his life) and he only does that because it's the right thing to do.

That just shows a blatant misunderstanding of the series, only one Death Eater is killed by a good guy in the entire series. Also he /is/ shown "taking down Greyback".

I think you're misunderstanding the point of most of the series. Also that it's a YA book that isn't going to have it's heroes brutally killing people.

I think that's largely down to the movies and I also don't think that manic fans who treat him like that mean that his character is different from what is actually in the books. Nor are they in any way the majority of HP fans.

I mean you clearly don't understand it if you think the point of the series is to Martyr yourself and if that's genuinely your takeaway I don't really think there's any point in having a conversation about it.

And again, Childrens books do not need to have that in there.

At the very end of the darkest book to save her daughter from the woman that murdered her brothers.

But anyway that's not even really the point, you can't think it's appropriate for Ron to kill someone randomly at the end of the series to redeem himself.

*************** First, Bellatrix did not kill fred or any other weasley. Except maybe Mollys brothers. Molly only goes for the kill when Bella shoots a spell at Ginny. Que "not my daughter you bitch!"

Secondly, there is a difference between battling oppression as was attempted to be shown, and what was shown as a war in the harry potter series. In war both sides have losses. I personally agree with Starfox that a "war" without any deatheater deaths is pathetic. And the whole concept of battling oppression means by definition that the oppressed will murder in their rise from oppression. Look at every single example in history. Every revolution except one has had a brutality to it. Even the glorious revolution killed the previous ruler. The only completely none violent revolution qas led by Ghandi. What JK wrote was a war without hell. Which isnt possible. Its one of the key reasons i loathe the 7th book

***************** We also can not say that Bellatrix killed Fabian and Gideon. All we know from canon was that it took a "group of" deatheaters to kill them. Also we can assume that if the Malfoys got off scotfree, then so did others. after all Harry Potter is all about forgive and get stabbed later. The fact that there is not a single "hero" killing another person except for Molly is wrong. "taking down" can mean stunning, while "dealing with" (im thinking of Avery now) can also mean stunning. There is two deaths told in the final battle on the death eater side. Molly is the only one to actually kill someone. Harry just killed Tom with an expelliarmus (which is also impossible but whatever)
