I read this fic awhile back, that I can't remember the name of, so if someone would be kind enough to tell me, it would be greatly appreciated! All I remember about it was that Padma was a complete contrarian and enjoyed to argue against whatever opinion Hermione had. It got to the point where over summer Padma would send multiple essay length letters about whatever article happened to come up just to get a rise out of Hermione. They weren't main characters. I believe it was Harry-focused and that he had formed a friend/study group with people from multiple houses. There was a scene where Harry notices that Padma doesn't have any friends besides her sister.

I remember thinking that it was the funniest Padma I had read (her arguing just for arguing had her advocate for some really bizarre positions), but the work wasn't complete at the time and I'd like to see how it progressed.

​

Thanks in advance!

*** Thank you! It's funny, this was my very first post on Reddit. I was going to do another another fic search request where Harry was acknowledged to be a boy by himself and muggles, but every single witch and wizard thought he was a girl. Now thanks to you, I found out they were the same story. Cheers!

** Would like to read this too since it may be the first time I see any story where people argue back to her over-opinionated personality.
