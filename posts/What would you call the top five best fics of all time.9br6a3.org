** *1 Out of the Night by Raining Ink*

The fully realised Knockturn Alley setting is amazing; interesting exploration of magic and especially dark magic; a more magically talented Harry than canon; an interesting character arc for Harry. The fic's biggest weakness is perhaps its over-emphasis on the dark magic it introduces.

*2 Forging the Sword by Myst Shadow*

Great Harry-Ron-Hermione friendship dynamic, in which it's not so much a trio as a collection of duos. Each pair has their own distinct way of relating to each other. Also contains an interesting exploration of magic and a realistic development of a more magically talented Harry than canon. The also has its characters discuss some "fan favourite" debates -- the utility of binding vows, wizards v Muggles -- and generally handles them well.

The fic's greatest weakness is its slow pace.

*3 Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi*

An interesting exploration of the development of a Dumbledore/Voldemort/Grindelwald type magical talent (Harry). Also the only "Harry's brother is the BWL" which doesn't feature ridiculous moustache-twirling Dumbledore or abusive/neglectful James and Lily. Harry leaves Hogwarts because of the cruelty of children and the way his magical talent sets him apart, not because of his home life. A slow burn fic, but that's part of the charm: it's all about following Harry's magical development.

The fic's weaknesses are its OC Calypso (stupid name for a start) and that it perhaps over-supered Durmstrang. Nonetheless, in many ways my fic Victoria Potter is an attempt to do a fem!Harry "Boy Who Lived".

*4 A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh*

An excellent exploration of an immortal female Harry who has lived through most of history. The strongest element of the fic is the characterisation of fem!Harry herself as well as the detailed coverage of historical periods. Also great Dumbledore scenes.

The fic's biggest weakness is the magic itself, which sometimes feels somewhat unimaginative and unmagical.

*5 What You Leave Behind by Newcomb*

Similar to Boy Who Lived, this fic is about the development of a magical genius Harry. Absolutely great depiction of magic, which captures all the charm, nuance and understated power of the HP magic system. Also great depiction of Dumbledore, which goes hand in hand with the magic, as Dumbledore is occupying a mentor-like role. Also Harry/Fleur, which is always welcome, and has Harry older than he was in canon, which makes for interesting new relationships within Hogwarts.

Likely to make its way up the list /when/ the author gets to later years.

Personally, I quite liked these stories but I don't think some deserve to be on this list because to me, a story is only as good as it's ending and a story that's been unfinished for years like Santi's story don't really deserve the "honor", compared to other, finished stories (or still updating very regularly.

**** Out of the Night is not on FF.Net so that link won't work. Link below.

For me, completion doesn't really matter at all. I view HP fanfiction as a sandbox to play in, and most fics I'm interested in for the ideas presented, not the actual story. When an ending is done well, it's like the cherry on the top. When it's done badly, it can leave a nasty aftertaste in the mouth. Either way, it's not the substance of the fic.

***** You know, its funny because I remember a while back reading a longer fic and being rather miffed about the ending.

So as a result I went back through my handy-dandy excel sheet and filtered and marked every completed fic that I could say I felt had an average (meaning issues are generally resolved, but it didn't leave a big mark) or worse (meaning the ending was such that it lowered the quality of the story in my mind). Well what do you know, I found an 87% match for this category for fics that weren't oneshots and longer than 25k words.

Say what you want about certain elements of JK Rowling and her world building, but the fact that she had a rough idea of /how/ she wanted the story to end meant that she had somewhere she was aiming in the distance even at the beginning. Most fanfiction I've encountered are written without an ending really in mind, and centered more on an idea or several ideas. This can be fun, but it leaves much to be desired in the conclusion if you haven't any thoughts on where you want to go with it.

Yeah, the author deleted the fic and departed the fanfiction world. The reasoning was that fanfiction was taking up a lot of their time and they wanted to focus on real life stuff. So long as the fic was online, it would remain a temptation to return to it. So they took it offline, but they gave everyone warning so that readers could download a copy.

** It really depends how you would define "best". It could be best in terms of story or it could be best in terms of idea and innovation, the second which can include unfinished fics.

Anyway, I'll just give you both list, starting by the innovative ones (not in any order):

*Harry Dursley and the chronicles of the King*

It covers only the first four years of cannon but has a worldbuilding that his amongst the greatest (best characterisation of Grindelwald I've ever read, hence my flair). It doesn't get to be on the other list because the Fourth Year is a mess due to time turners.

It is finished (with a sequel you can ignore).

*Harry Potter and the prince of Slytherin*

In all honesty, this fic doesn't /really/ innovate but it take all the tropes that you've seen in other fics and /does them correctly/ I do not know how this is possible but every single trope that is mishandled and brutalized by others reach their full potential here. Other than that it is nicely (if a bit naively at times) written, if you can get past the horrible first chapter (thankfully very short).

It is still ongoing.

*Blood crest*

I honestly don't know how to present this story besides what the summary says... to make long story short, it is one of the most interesting take on necromancy that I have read (not that I've read a lot of those...).

It is still ongoing (if a tad slowly) and would be in the other list if it was finished (probably).

*To judge a book*

It'll probably never be finished but damn if it isn't interesting, with one of my favourite Killing Curse scar.

*With strength of steel wings*

Remember what I said about the necromancy in Blood crest? You can say the same about runes and tattoos here (especially when coupled with ritual scarification).

It's better than I make it sound like but is sadly unfinished.

.

linkffn(Harry Dursley and the Chronicles of the King; Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin; Blood Crest; To judge a book; With Strength of Steel Wings)

*** The list of the ones I consider best, as a story with a beginning, middle and conclusion (or at least one that is updating consistently), like the other one, it will be in no particular order:

*The Art of self-fashioning*

Think transfiguration is boring and useless in fighting? You just haven't seen what someone driven can do to the field, especially when they aren't limited by small things like self-preservation.

It is finished.

*The many Deaths of Harry Potter*

Remember those fic that are a "do-over" by reincarnation of the protagonist? Harry don't but it doesn't let that stop him (or: Re:Zero in Harry Potter).

It is finished.

*Too young to die*

Very angsty but great. Just remember that every single loose thread is tied at the end (and some exist only because we don't see other pov's than Harry's) (and that the tears are worth it in the end).

It is finished.

*the Firebird trilogy*

A great fic that takes cannon and change it drastically without harming the characters characterisation. Or: how would a story focusing on "Soul-Bonds" harems would really work in a world of magic.

It is finished.

*A fresh bouquet*

An OCSI that knows cannon and hasn't been reborn in the nicest of times tries to make everything possible to survive the war.

It is still ongoing.

.

Also, because I cannot not include it in some shape or form, here's the best "crack" story I've ever read:

*2 girls 1 cup*

The title is a troll but is well earned. I do not think I've read another "crack" fic that is half as cracky as that one.

** *1. Out of the Night by Raining Ink*

I absolutely love the emphasis this fic gives on making magic magical. The magic it introduces is, well, beautiful. It's a pity that it's abandoned. Especially with the hints of Harry/Astoria near the end, that ship doesn't have many interesting fics to its name.

Deleted but rehosted by someone else here: linkffn(12723942)

*2. The Futile Facade by murkybluematter* (series)

I was skeptical about this one at first, but everyone recommended it so eventually I read it. And just wow. This fic is amazing. The amount of detail it goes into about potions is extraordinary.

It's biggest flaw (in my opinion) is that some of the plot is taken from Alanna the Lioness. But I suppose that's no worse than the other half of the plot being taken from Harry Potter, is it? Either way, even that's not enough to knock it down from top 5, especially as I've never read Alanna the Lioness.

Updated recently after a long period of not updating. So, hopefully going to continue? linkffn(11911497)

*3. Fractal by OnTheImportanceOfLungs*

Massive AU. The world and the magic seem bigger and more magical. Not like canon's "Modern UK, but with magic, bad puns, and things moving and being annoying for no reason whatsoever".

Allegedly, it's a rewrite of some other fic, but the difference between the two is night and day.

linkffn(8545947)

*4. To Reach Without by inwardtransience*

This has, I have to say, some of the best characterization of Harry/Melantha going through the process of reworking her life when she suddenly became a girl. It also has a more interesting (and, dare I say it, more realistic) world which is detailed better in the author's other main story, The Long Game (linkffn(11762909)).

Unfortunately both stories suffer from the author's flaw of adding new and unlikable characters for no reason whatsoever. To Reach Without handles this better than The Long Game, but I still very nearly left To Reach Without off this list for that reason.

linkffn(1862560)

*5. I Know Not, and I Cannot Know--Yet I Live and I Love by billowsandsmoke*

Luna and Snape friendship. Canon-compliant one-shot.

linkffn(11923164)

--------------

If I could get another 6, they'd be these.

*Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi*

This one is tricky. But it's well-written, nonetheless. I love Calypso as a character. She has to be one of my all-time favorite OCs.

linkffn(5353809) but there's a longer version on some Russian site.

*anything by Ellory*

Ellory writes (or wrote) a number of one-shots dealing with pureblood culture, and in particular courting customs. Very well written, often AU. Unfortunately, there's not a whole lot too them since they're romance one-shots.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1614796/Ellory]]

*Black Luminary by YakAge*

Major AU featuring a dark Harry as a member of the Black family. It's good, but a bit weird.

*The Legacy by storytellerSpW*

HP/DG contract, but not quite what you might think it is. Features one of the best relationship developments that I've seen in a long time. Which is the major focus. The rest isn't quite as good though.

*Alexandra Quick by Inverarity* (series)

American wizarding school. Only tangentially Potterverse, but the world is really well-done. (Certainly better than that manure Rowling calls wizarding America!) My major concern with it is that the main character is frustrating to read on the second read-through.

linkffn(3964606)

*Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time by joe6991*

Somewhat revolutionary, honestly. I can't put it on my top 5 because it reads like a jackhammer, but it's still quite good.

linkffn(4068153)

--------------

And some honorable mentions:

*Six Pomegranite Seeds by Seselt* linkffn(12132374)

*Princess of the Blacks by Silently Watches* (series)

*Ectomancer by RustyRed* linkffn(4563439)

--------------

And a few that would have made it, but they jumped the shark (even if only a little bit):

*Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man* linkffn(11191235)

Years one and two were good, but I've not enjoyed pretty much anything after that. It's still well-written. Just not as good any more.

*Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbonë by enembee* linkffn(7287278)

Major change of pace partway through. Unfortunately for it, because before that I'd have put it much higher.

  Harry left to go fight Voldemort. Now, he comes home two weeks later--and finds his two best friends engaged. But there is more to the story than meets the eye. Especially when he finds out Hermione's pregnant. With his baby. (will eventually be HHr)

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...

** *1) Basilisk-born by Ebenbild*

It's a WIP, but super good Harry gets thrown back in time and has to live each day till he gets to the present. Everything written is well thought out and has a connection to newer parts of the Fic and the world building is amazingly done

*2) The Debt of Time by ShayaLonnie*

Amazing Marauder Era fic, where Hermione is taken to back to the 70s and grows up with James Potter, as a 5th Marauder. It's a Sirius/Hermione ship but the detail that went into it is great

*3) Rise of the Wizards by Teufel1987*

This is a canon divergent from the end of OoTP. Its a darker Harry Fanfic where he becomes mistrustful of Dumbledore and company, and how he takes over the wizarding world. It's very political and has a strong beginning with setting up the stage with a strong ending.

*4) A Marauder's Plan by CatsAreCool*

Canon Divergent from the end of POA. What if Sirius decided to stay in England after escaping Hogwarts and try to clear his name. This is a great Sirius is a father figure to Harry. Plays with Ancient and Noble House

*5) Angry Harry and the Seven by Sinyk*

AU, marriage contract with Daphne Greengrass. Follows HP & DG all the 7 years as they go through Hogwarts. Lords, Manipulative but redeemed Dumbledore. He and Harry start off the wrong foot but learn to work together. It's a well written detailed book into the History of the Ancient and Noble Houses, and traditions of the noble. Minor politics iirc.

** Limiting myself to one story per author, and to completed stories only, I'm going for:

- linkffn(Limpieza de Sangre by TheEndless7) The interplay between Harry and Emily is incredible, and the way it influences Harry in his relationships with others is handled superbly. What's more subtle is the effect Harry has on Emily in return.

- linkffn(The Debt of Time by ShayaLonnie) If there's one criticism it's that Hermione/Mia is an almost perfect entity incapble of doing wrong in anyone's eyes, except her own. But it's written brilliantly and manages to weave known canon events into its plot without stumbling.

- linkffn(Patron by Starfox5) A compelling and genuinely different "alternate universe", exploring many different aspects of magic and much more.

- linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense by murkybluematter) Cheating a bit because although this book is finished, the series is ongoing. Manages to take a premise that can't possible work and damn well makes it work. The characters are great and it contains really original approaches to potions and potion-making.

- Vox Corporis (removed from ffn now) One of the best love stories out there. It's possibly a little dated these days but still holds up really well.

If I had to include unfinished stories, then Unlike a Sister, Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past, A Long Journey Home, Prince of the Dark Kingdom and With Strength of Steel Wings would have to fit in somewhere.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.

** 1. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality]]) -- you can love it, you can hate it, you can ignore it. But still it's the most remarkable fanfiction story among all others.

2. [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/5185][Forever Knight]] -- the most complex and fulfilling representation of Vampires.

3. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10496512/1/Where-is-Hermione]]) -- I'm including it, because it's the first fic that rightfully and realistically bash the common trope "Hermione can't do wrong".

4, 5... Honestly, don't know. There are some remarkable fics, but none of them can be called "the best".

[Edit]: after some thinking I've added the third story.

******* Personally, I find the writing and dialogue stilted, awkward and unnatural. Harry's character is also gratingly obnoxious, and is often used as the author's mouthpiece to correct what he perceives as the flaws of JK Rowling's world in a condescending manner. I think that this is just bad form; fanfiction is about the appreciation of the original work, and not about ripping holes in it and making it seem like you are somehow better/smarter than Rowling because you've managed to create a more 'logical' world. I know many fics exploit plot holes and try to make theirs a better version of events in so doing, but there's a way to do it without having unbearable arrogance leak through every word, and even then, I tend to avoid those milder fics. All of this is compounded with the fact that HPMoR is practically revered by some people as being the greatest piece of fanfiction of all-time and its place on the top of the Most Favourited list. Being one of the HPMoR haters, I'm of the opinion that it doesn't deserve that spot, and its place there only increases my distaste for it even more.

It's one of those fics that you know you love or you hate in the first few chapters. I couldn't get past chapter 22 of HPMoR, and I absolutely hated Harry's character.

I believe there's a more detailed (and negative) critique out there by someone who does a chapter by chapter review of HPMoR. A quick Google search should turn up with it, but since I'm on my phone it's a bit inconvenient to link it. Anyway, I think what I've said covers most of the main points of why HPMoR is hated.

EDIT: Clarifying points.

** Not sure about the top five, but i say the best two right now are Melindaleo's fanfics that she had recently written, These Cuts I have, about Harry trying to cope and move on after the battle and taking down Voldemort, and Some cuts leave Scars, when the Boys(Harry and Ron) and the girls (Hermione and Ginny) are seperated for some time while while the girls are at Hogwarts finishing their last year.
