I'm thinking of writing a fic where, as a twist, Harry would be the villain in the end (it'd be told from multiple perspectives).


** Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.... Good old Voldy was so close to establishing his kingdom if it werent for those meddling kids.

**** Isn't there a time travel story where that name was explained away by Harry being drunk and thinking it would be funny to name his son after all his worst enemies? I think it was Albus Severus Tom Vernon Potter or something.

  101 names and the logic behind them that Harry and Ginny could have used, because if there's one thing most of the fandom agrees on, it's that Albus Severus Potter was a horrible name for Harry's second child. Names are Sirius, serious, and silly. Name suggestions taken and appreciated!

** Do you want villain or antagonist? A villain does evil things. An antagonist opposes the protagonist (the main character). These two things often go together but not necessarily.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

  AU. Years after his defeat of Voldemort, Harry Potter remains a willing and secret prisoner of the Ministry, but not all is what it seems. Harry has a plan, and the world will never be the same.
