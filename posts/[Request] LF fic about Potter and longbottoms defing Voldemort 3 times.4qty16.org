I have been looking for a fanfic I read in 2008ish about how the Potters and Longbottoms defied Voldemort 3 times. There was a chapter I remember about the Potter wedding at Mcgonagall's estate, Death Eaters and Voldemort came, Petunia came and Lily saved her with a shield charm from Malfoy or Bellatrix. Yeah I can't remember anything else, but that chapter.

Also taking suggestions for similar fics.
