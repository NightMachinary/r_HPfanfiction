**** Its really close to the next chapter being done, in the last update about it, she said it was about 65% done, and this was early dec. It really doesn't matter much that its incomplete, on her tumblr she keeps posting random facts about the fic every week, with snippets from either the past or future. its "[[http://taliesin-19.tumblr.com/]]"

Don't be discouraged because of it being incomplete, its really worth it.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

***** Not the guy you're replying to, but I'll say it felt very underdeveloped to me. I want to say that it felt rushed, but really they just went for a walk at the end of season 4 so I can't really say it was rushed. More sudden than rushed, I guess.

I don't think immature and unbelievable are the words I would use, but all the same I wasn't really satisfied with what we got.

***** Korrasami happens at the last second because fans wanted it. It's built up so poorly, the "writers" needed to explain it later on in interviews.

But it's okay, because everything about this show is poorly written. It's just a kid's show after all. Some crappy cartoon throwing around big boy concepts like terrorism and ptsd and spirituality and politics to disguise the fact that Spongebob tackled most of these subjects with more wit and depth.

  A sixth-year adventure told from Ron's perspective. RonHermione; HarrySusan. The Trio must stop Voldemort from wiping out Muggles. THIS IS A RE-WRITE. Rated R for language, violence, and sexual situations.
