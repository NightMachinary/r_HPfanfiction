** I tend to find that there are some really good crossovers that have extremely overpowered harry...usually consisting of chapter one being the complete victory of harry over voldemort opening up the crossover for a variety of series. In particular I enjoy several star wars fics.

#+begin_quote
  Ahsoka feeling abandoned, betrayed and disillusioned with the Jedi Order, decided to part ways. She left to find meaning and purpose in her life. She never expected it to come in the form of an enigmatic green eyed young man who had more than a passing interest in the past. She never imagined that learning about the history of the galaxy could be so dangerous---or magical.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

This reminds me of something else do you know a story where the witches are weaker than the wizard so they bond to the wizards so they share his power weakening him in the process and harry figures out how to avoid that.. Tom never bonded and its why hes a dark lord. Albus bonded YEARS ago and they let him get away with being powerful since hes so old...
