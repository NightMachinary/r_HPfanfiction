  'I have nothing more to say to you, Potter,' he said quietly. 'You have irked me too often, for too long. AVADA KEDAVRA!'

  Harry had not even opened his mouth to resist; his mind was blank, his wand pointing uselessly at the floor.

  "But..." Harry raised his hand instinctively toward the lightning scar. It did not seem to be there. "But I should have died! I didn't defend myself! I meant to let him kill me!"

  "And that," said Dumbledore, "will, I think, have made all the difference."

--------------

So, in Deathly Hallows, right near the end, we find that apparently because Harry didn't resist being killed by Voldemort, he ironically survived and Voldemort's horcrux 'took the hit' instead.

Staring down the magical equivalent of a incoming freight train without so much as flinching, though, I can't help but think that would be a teeny bit difficult, psychologically speaking.

So...why did Harry just pretty much give up upon encountering Voldemort near the end of Order of the Phoenix? Compared to the last time he encountered Voldemort, back in his first year, where he attacked Quirrelmort with his bare hands (which conveniently worked)?

Given that we find out later on that not-resisting like that would have actually saved his life and removed the horcrux in him...do you suppose that it's possible that Manipulative!Dumbledore (if you believe in that characterisation) put a compulsion or suggestion on Harry to make him shut down when faced with Voldemort's killing curse?

Although if that's the case, then I can't come up with an explanation for why Dumbledore swooped in to save him at that exact moment; not unless he wasn't 100% sure it would work and Voldemort killing Harry then would completely and utterly destabilise the Ministry (the guy you're denying returned showed up and killed the witness you've been vilifying all year? You're so fired.) or something.


** Dumbledore would have let him die if that was the case. Harry was just paralyzed with emotion. Fear, grief, shock.

** I doubt the deep and ancient magic of sacrifice would have worked if the sacrifice was in fact not willing.

** 1. No. I believe him going there and allowing himself to be killed of his own free will was part of the shtick.

1. I'm not sure you were suggesting if this was a possible course of action or if you were just bringing up his defiance, but don't forget that Voldemort's ritual in GOF negated that protection.

2. There is a bit of a debate about which schools of magic persist after death, but everything we've seen canonically points towards magic being cast against a person failing when the caster dies. My only example: Dumbledore's petrification spell on Harry in HBP.

3. No.
