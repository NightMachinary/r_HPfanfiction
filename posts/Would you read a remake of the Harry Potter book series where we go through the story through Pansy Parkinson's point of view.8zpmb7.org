Question above. And there would be 8 books instead of 7 and the *titles of them all would be called this:*

1. Pansy Parkinson and the House of Slytherin
2. Pansy Parkinson and the Chamber of Secrets
3. Pansy Parkinson and the Prisoner of Azkaban
4. Pansy Parkinson and the Triwizard Tournament
5. Pansy Parkinson and the Super Cool Teacher
6. Pansy Parkinson and the Super Annoying Teacher
7. Pansy Parkinson and the Dark Lord
8. Pansy Parkinson and the Unforgettable Night


** If the story follows the stations of canon, then no. If it's another "Slytherins are noble, misunderstood souls, bullied by evil Gryffindors and faced with ignorant mudbloods trying to tear down Wizarding Culture", then no.

If canon gets derailed early on and Pansy gets a redemption arc, ending up fighting bigotry - probably. I've written an AU story myself where she's one of the POV characters, starting as Draco's girlfriend and ending up with Ron.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** No. She is uninteresting.

Draco Malfoy would be better. Or perhaps a peripheral Slytherin like Blaise would be even more interesting. You'd have a ton of leeway to write your story, dip into canon events when you feel like it, then slither back into your own world-building.

Things you can explore:

- Knockturn Alley (and other "bad" shops)
- Dark Magic (Capital "D" - Dark)
- Foreign witches and wizards
- Foreign magical culture
- Living life under Ministry thumb, maybe you have memorabilia that are Dark, they are taken away from you, then the story is the path taken to retrieve what was taken.

Pro-tip. Don't think heavily about the sequels before you've written the first story. You never know how your fic will pan out. For example, I originally planned four books in my series, some covering a couple years. However, I had a light bulb go off in my head and realized two separate stories is all I needed to convey the change in my characters.

*** She's not interesting to you, maybe. Personally, I think it's fun to read a story from a bitchy character's point of view, and seeing whether she changes or not depending on her experiences.

**** To each their own, I suppose. I prefer /grander/ stories, therefore need characters closer to the big stuff, therefore if they aren't involved they are at least fly-on-the-wall.

I never took Pansy as intelligent or involved enough with things, similar to Lavender Brown. In my head Blaise is a more reserved Slytherin and unexplored enough to craft a unique story skirting around canon, and Draco is extremely well placed to craft a good story.

This so much. I spent possibly hours working on an outline for sequels and when my story went a different way, a lot of it had to be scrapped. Write ideas, plan foreshadowing, but don't absolutely dedicate yourself to certain things.

** I think it's okay if you take into consideration the things people are telling you - BUT, also, some people can be harsh... and not all people necessarily will think the same way they do, so I guess it's better if you do you. If you want to write a story about Pansy or whichever character you'd like, with canon or not, do it! The point is for you to have fun doing something you like! I'm pretty sure any story can be good if you put effort and there's going to be someone who will enjoy it. It's also good to learn, so don't be afraid to give it a try. Good luck!

** I like alternate viewpoint stories, but I am not sure Pansy's could make up a whole series of books. A few One-shots, definitely. but books may be a bit much.
