** Peeves is a poltergeist, the magical manifestation of the chaos, exuberance, irreverance, etc. of Hogwarts' children.

Filch and Norris are the magical manifestation of the bitter despair and frustration of her staff trying and failing to rein in said chaos.

Together, they form part of the gestalt consciousness of Hogwarts.

*** Was reading a fic the other day where Peeves is actually Helga Hufflepuff, Mrs Norris is Rowena Ravenclaw and the Sorting Hat is Godric Griffyndor (he's pretty bitter he doesn't have legs).

Peeves/Helga causes so much chaos because she's trying to live up to Hogwart's greatest prankster - Salazar Slytherin.

****** Vandal savage, after centuries of leading and outliving his various societies decided he'd pursue a few lifetimes of quite peace. He pursued a career in the arts, construction, a few years of bartending before deciding to try his luck as 'The mysterious janitor' trope.

One day, between jobs, he found the leaky cauldron and magical society (again) and found an ad in the prophet looking for a custodian for hogwarts.

He decided that he'd give it a try, it would give him some excitement and mystery that he'd missed over the long years before he tried to concure the world once more.

Sadly he was on the receiving end of an errant spell and can't remember who he was. The persona of Argus Filch is all he knows until he is released from the spell... if anyone cared to look and see that he was bespelled.
