Not an interrogation, but him going through a normal day or so while on it.


** ...Strange, as soon as I read this I thought of the episode of Get Smart with the lie pill.

"Yes, I would very much like a punch on the nose!"

I wonder how this would go with anti-veritaserum instead? So that everything Harry says is a lie?

  What happens when there's a party in the Gryffindor common room and Harry accidentally drinks a truth serum developed by the Weasley twins? Weasley-bashing galore. One-shot. A touch of crude language.

  A series of Vignettes involving possibly the second most powerful but underused magic in the HP universe, Veritaserum. AU after GOF. Rating increased to T due to a bit of implied sexual situations, attempted suicide, abuse, and other nasty stuff.
