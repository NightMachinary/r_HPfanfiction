:END:
The Evil Harry was always trying to murder his siblings and killing animals. James and the Marauders hated him but Lily was holding out hope for him. Harry is reborn into his body and makes up to his siblings and parents. Thanks in advance.


** wait wait this reminds me of a fic.

in the fic harry somehow ended up in the same world as a deatheater!harry because he was like, searching for rowenas diadem in a cave?

and then he ends up in the potters cellar and he tries to explain himself to dumbledore and the evil sibling had killed one of his siblings who liked herbology or something? and then harry somehow escapes and he runs around with two children who were kidnapped by bellatrix? because if thats the fic then i may have it!

**** Can I recommend the most splendid and glorious [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4413323/chapters/10023830?view_adult=true][^{A Big Happy Weasley Family}]] instead? Because having looked over the fic you mentioned, it doesn't appear to be written too well.
