***** For some reason, that one keeps going to the top of my bookmarks page (ordered by date last updated) even though there isn't a new chapter. Like, I read chp 12 on day one, then day two has it back to the top of my bookmarks page even though it still is only 12 chapters.

  The fiasco that is Harry's life could be summed up in two words --- Avada Kedavra. Those words have haunted him for as long as he can remember, endangering him with their very existence. He'd resigned himself to a life without a soulmate, to pain and sorrow... but then the Blacks happened. Or, one Black in particular.Whose idea was it to let a Black woman invent time travel, anyway?

  Being reborn as a daughter of the House of Black was bewildering, but realising they weren't actually evil was another problem entirely. Despite a name and gender change, Harry Potter wasn't someone who would let their family suffer for no reason. Lyra was a Black, and Blacks protect their own. Time travel, genderbending - fem! Harry, slash and fem slash, same-sex pregnancies.
