I want to see murder and an insanely evil/dark Harry! Any pairings are fine.


** Evil:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6985795/1/Xerosis][Xerosis by Batsutousai]] - Honestly the only Voldy/Harry slash I've ever enjoyed, quite good.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2232745/1/Hero-Villain-Saviour-Conqueror][Hero, Villain, Saviour, Conqueror by Lady Smoothie]], one of the better Harry goes to Azkaban and turns dark fics.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/84440/chapters/113998][Harry Potter And The Dark Lord Sidious by angelholme]] Harry/Luna/evil.

--------------

Sort of evil:

The Harveste Addams series by kyaru-chan. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6341291/1/Harveste][0 (Short beginning)]] - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6343441/1/Harveste-Addams-and-the-Sorceror-s-Stone][1]] - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6345632/1/Harveste-Addams-and-the-Chamber-of-Secrets][2]] - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6349792/1/Harveste-Addams-and-the-Prisoner-of-Azkaban][3]] - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6356100/1/Harveste-Addams-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire][4]] - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6533730/1/Harveste-Addams-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix][5]] - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7388007/1/Harveste-Addams-and-the-HalfBlood-Prince][6]] Harry/blaise/draco/hermione. Harry snaps and kills the Dursleys at age 7 or so, gets adopted by the Addams, and decides to wear dresses. Yeah, that last part threw me for a loop too, but aside from that it's a pretty good series. Book 6 is incomplete and it doesn't look like the authors going to be completing the series.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion by Rorschach's Blot]] . This one is a toss up, on the one hand, all the people he kills are bastards or evil, on the other hand he enjoys the hell out of it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6966314/1/DOOM-Day][Doom Day By Joshua-the-Evil-Guy]] - A groundhogs day fic, a few times Harry goes a /little/ crazy and tortures people to death, particularly Snape and Umbitch. Though in his defense, it really was a case of temporary insanity.

--------------

More amoral than evil/dark:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate][When In Doubt, Obliviate By: Sarah1281]], Harry raised by Lockhart, nuff' said.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedyby nonjon]] - Stealing from death eaters, pissing off the wizarding government, and just plain not giving a fuck.

**** One more I finished reading (Prompted by your question wanted to read a dark fic, been putting it off since I don't generally like post-hogwarts fics, but turns out after 6 paragraphs it skims Harry's 7 years and a decade after. )

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4133028/1/The-Birth-of-Evil][The Birth of Evil by DisobedienceWriter]] - Quite good. Harry becomes Voldy's equal pre-hogwarts in that he can do some wandless magic, though surprisingly the author doesn't delve into the "Super Harry" area too badly at first, instead doing it gradually, he has to work hard at it at first and eventually in Hogwarts he forgoes a wand in place of a fake to avoid losing his ability, but it's assumed that it's at least as hard wandlessly as with a wand the first year. Though after that.. Well, that stops pretty quick, becoming super-intelligent-powerful Harry, though more believable than some fics.

He gets rid of corrupt politicians and death eaters with a mixture of public shaming of their corruption, and assassination, as well as destroying large amounts of wizarding gold to reduce bribes.

My only big complaint is that the whole thing is too short, only 25,965 words to cover 7 years of Hogwarts, and decades-a century after, seems rushed to say the least.

** Oh god I used to read a bunch of really good dark Harry fics. I can't remember any now, but if I find any I'll post them.

That being said, others please post some! I know there must be some good ones since I stopped reading them.

--------------

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/Again-and-Again][Again and again]]*

/The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp/

I really like this one. He isn't so much dark as much as just working with Voldemort. The writing is top notch and one of my favourite stories.

--------------

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9315209/1/Out-of-the-Night][Out of the Night]]*

/Adopted from Raining Ink. Between 5th and 6th years, Harry is ready to take his life into his own hands. He's making decisions that will change the course of the war and he's determined to learn the truth about Dark magic. Independent!Harry. Dark!Harry. No pairings./

Another really good one. This one explores more of what is really means to be a 'dark' wizard, more than just casting dark spells and stuff.

--------------

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6953303/19/A-Snake-Named-Voldemort][A Snake Named Voldemort]]*

/COMPLETE After being turned into a snake and unable to change back, Lord Voldemort is forced to turn to the only other living Parselmouth, Harry Potter. After making a deal, Harry agrees to help the Dark Lord return to his human form. SLASH HP/LVTMR/

Honestly, not really a dark Harry fic, but its too good to not post.

--------------

*I'll see if I can find more. They aren't really super dark Harry or insane, but the first is a great story, the second delves into what makes a wizard dark and the third is also really good. I know I've read other really dark/insane/powerful Harry fics, let me see if I can find them.*

--------------

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6254783/1/Rise-of-the-Wizards][Rise of the Wizards]]*

/Voldemort's attempt at possessing Harry had a different outcome when Harry fought back with the "Power He Knows Not". This set a change in motion that shall affect both Wizards and Muggles. AU after fifth year: Featuring a darkish and manipulative Harry/

A really great story about Harry vanquishing the world of muggles. Would highly recommend.

--------------

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4924413/1/Dark-and-Light][Dark and Light]]*

/He was a genius. He could paint, play music, talk to snakes, control fire. He was more powerful and intelligent then any knew. He had strong 'friends'. The problem was, he had few emotions. Dark Harry. I Do Not Own Harry Potter. -Slash-/

Not so much insane but he is pretty messed up. Good fic.

--------------

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6163339/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Descent-into-Darkness][Harry Potter and the Descent into Darkness]]* /and the sequel/ *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6367096/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Breeding-Darkness][Harry Potter and the Breeding Darkness]]*

/4th yr. Through an accident Harry and Voldemort's Horcrux begin to interact and Harry slowly begins to change. He becomes stronger & slowly grows aware of the sinister events that have perpetuated his entire life. Dark!Harry eventual LV/HP SLASH/

Really great fic. I think the sequel is abandoned, but its a really great fic.
