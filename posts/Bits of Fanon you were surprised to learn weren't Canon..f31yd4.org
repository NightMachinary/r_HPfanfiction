Every once in a while I'll read a direct quote from canon, or a chapter in canon, or a pet peeve post on reddit and realize that a bit of fanon I thought to be canon wasn't after all.

Past ones for me have been Nevilles mom not actually being Harry's godmother, Snape not actually being Draco's godfather, and Sirius actually knowing from the beginning that Dumbledore was having Hagrid take Harry to the Dursleys (that one was a surprise for me, how many fics have that same scene where Sirius realizes that Harry has spent the last thirteen years with Petunia and that it is the last place he was supposed to go? As opposed to acquiescing to Hagrids insistence that Dumbledore said Harry was supposed to go to his muggle relatives)

Most recently was the fact that the Sorting Hat does apparently discuss what it finds out in students heads with the Headmaster, as at the end of CoS Dumbledore is aware that Harry told the hat not to put him in Slytherin.

What were pieces of fanon you were surprised to find out weren't canon?


** Basically any fanon with the Wizengamot is not supported by canon. Most of them claim things about pureblood heads of their house have a seat and are a lord of some kind. There's no evidence in canon for this. To be fair, there's also not a lot of evidence regarding how wizards and witches are appointed to the Wizengamot in the first place.

*** The Wizengamot always confused me- is it a legislative or judicial body? IRL these things are normally kept [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers#United_Kingdom][separate]]. For example in the UK it's:

- Parliament -- legislature
- Prime Minister, Cabinet, Government Departments and Civil Service -- executive
- Courts -- judiciary

While in fics you have the Wizengamot convicting criminals in one chapter and voting on laws the next.

#+end_quote

In short, yes.

To fully explain, according to the only canon [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/order-of-merlin][article]] (if you consider J.K. Rowling's Pottermore writings as canon) that references the Wizengamot says that it acts as both the court and parliament.

However, there is another judicial body called "The Council of Magical Law," referenced in /Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire/, Chapter 30 "The Pensieve." Unfortunately, there seems to be even less known about this council than the Wizengamot.

I remember a fic that has Harry talking about the Council of Magical Law because he saw it in the Pensieve and then the other characters ask him how does he know about it since it was only a short-lived assemblage for the aftermath of the first war.

**** It's both - and actually, IRL having them be separate is more of a modern thing.

In the case of the Wizengamot, I believe it's at least partly influence by an actual anglo-saxon institution, the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witenagemot][Witen-agemot]] from the ~7th-11th century. At least the names are strangely similar. The RL assembly was a council of nobles that had some sorts of legislative power (ie, they might meet with the king and promulgate laws together), gave advice to the rulers, had some choice over succession, etc - but like any such council of nobles, its actual powers and influence was never quite fixed and would wax/wane over time.

This reinforces to me that the Wizengamot could very easily be a (partly) hereditary body - it's ancient, has its name from an explicit council of nobles, and the WW doesn't really modernize all that quickly. At the same time, I think that it's also clearly not entirely hereditary - and that the Minister seems to have a decent chunk of control over its members. So my headcanon on the subject is that some families have hereditary seats, while the Minister can nominate others to take part in the Wizengamot.

I could also picture the HP one as a bit like the French parlements of the Ancien Regime with some increased legislatural power on the side.

***** *Witenagemot*

The Witenaġemot (Old English: witena ġemōt, Old English pronunciation: [ˈwitenɑ jeˈmoːt], modern English "meeting of wise men"), also known as the Witan (more properly the title of its members), was a political institution in Anglo-Saxon England which operated from before the 7th century until the 11th century. The Witenagemot was an assembly of the tribe whose primary function was to advise the king and whose membership was composed of the most important noblemen in England, both ecclesiastic and secular. The institution is thought to represent an aristocratic development of the ancient Germanic general assemblies, or folkmoots. In England, by the 7th century, these ancient folkmoots had developed into convocations of the land's most powerful and important people, including ealdormen, thegns, and senior clergy, to discuss matters of both national and local significance.

***** Huh. It always bothered me in the OotP movie when Fudge pronounced it "wiz-zen-aga-mot" instead of "wiz-zen-gam-mut" (which I felt was more accurate). Now that you've taught me about the Witenagemot, I wonder if the actor was pronouncing it that way on purpose to make the comparison more apparent.

I'm still not giving Michael Gambon a pass for pronouncing Beauxbatons "bo-bat-tins", though.

**** If we're talking purely in terms of book canon (so no Pottermore or anything like that) Judicial, I think.

We know Arthur, who is nominally a civil servant or a bureaucrat, wrote an important law... which suggests wizarding society has no legislature as we would understand it.

This is then consistent with "the Minister for Magic" which is the head of the bureaucracy of the Ministry. This terminology is always very consistent and it positions the Ministry as effectively just part of Britain's wider government (I actually read a fic once, don't remember which, that took this to its logical extreme, i.e. that the Minister is theoretically just a minister same as the Home Secretary or the Chancellor).

It also seems, to me, that there is no electoral process whatsoever and that, instead, the Minister is simply chosen as a consequence of office politics. This also explains why the Death Eaters and the Order exist... they're not political parties but instead secret societies that spend their time infiltrating the bureaucracy. Given the blatant Nazi allegory, this really rather suggests an absence of political parties. And given Dumbledore's tendency to use agents, if there were elections it seems fairly self evident there would have been a candidate everyone knows is Dumbledore's candidate. Wizarding society really only seems to make sense if it's a whole bunch of people responding to informal mechanisms. Once everyone thinks everyone is losing confidence in Fudge, everyone would be looking for someone else because there's no formal mechanism (such as an election) to see if people have actually lost confidence in Fudge.

(I don't think Rowling designed it deliberately like this... it's just that the system looks an awful lot like an aristocracy, i.e. personal status and political status are 100% equivalent. Back in the day France didn't go to war with England but instead of the King of France and the King of England were personally at war. It's all very schoolyard, right? Doesn't that sound a lot like Draco vs Harry, so why not also apply it to Dumbledore vs Voldemort? This personal = political is, incidentally, why Magna Carta reads like a contract, not a law. It is a contract.)

Whether or not there's taxation in the wizarding world is an interesting question. Reading the books leaves me with an impression that Lucius Malfoy funds the Ministry pretty much on his own (which, frankly, explains a lot about what happens in the books).

*** Well I'd say it's pretty straight forward how they are appointed. They obviously have to see who can poke the Umbrage with a stick without her noticing, this most likely why she is so pink. the minister of magic is elected by a contest to see who is the best at transfiguration, this would also explain Umbrage as she is most likely a failed attempt of turning a toad into a human. Malfoy obviously rigged the votes as there is no way Fudge could be good at anything.

***** I think there's reasonably clear evidence against the whole "lord" thing because ultimately it all comes down to the "noble and most ancient house of Black". This is a family which is presented as being completely up its own arse about pure blood stuff... as in to an unusual extent. And sure maybe you can argue that most of the reason we get that presentation is because our observer is Harry and a lot of the information comes from Sirius. But the reality is that the books take a very strong line against pure blood ideology and the only other family we meet who take things as seriously as the Blacks are basically exiles from wizarding society as a whole (i.e. the Gaunts). Conclusion? They call themselves a "noble and most ancient house" to make themselves feel good... no different to the "Peverell coat of arms".

I mean... there are no wizarding princes.

****** Well, the 'lord' aspect doesn't fully rely on the Black family and how they style themselves. It's more an offshoot of the pureblood culture - that is, we know that there's a bunch of Purebloods who view themselves as superior to those who aren't as such, and those ancient families can be quite wealthy (eg - the Malfoys) and aristocratic. Combine that with them being the majority of the WW historically, and institutions/power seems like they'd be arranged around them.

Throw in that a lot of the time, the WW seems to be somewhat backwards in how they're politically organized... it's not hard to imagine that there's a holdover from medieval/aristocratic institutions, particularly since the UK actually does have a house of parliament still called 'House of Lords'.

It's obviously not stated in canon either way - but I think it's reasonable to see the whole lord thing extended to most of the purebloods. After all, we know basically nothing about the political organization of the WW.

Also, for Notice-Me-Not, the biggest canon example is Harry not noticing The Leaky Cauldron (that's in London) until Hagrid points it out to him. Since he's a wizard he wouldn't be affected by a Muggle Repelling Charm, so it should be a different charm, which I think is one of the main inspirations for the fanon "NMN Charm."

**** I mean, it is one of those things that when taking things into context regarding the Wizarding World, it's one of those things that you would easily consider a part of it despite the idea never being explicitly stated.

1. Wizarding world is traditional, and definitely clings to things that the muggles have since moved on from.

   1. old wealthy families would likely cling to tradition even more so.

2. An old tradition, admittedly that no longer seems to have any actual importance here in the US, was that you would name someone that held your ideals, that you trusted, and yet wasn't a family member as the godparent to your child so that if something happened to you you could be certain that the child would be "raised right" because the godparent would be the one the child goes to.\\

   1. Narcissa directly refers to Snape as "Lucius's old friend".
   2. Narcissa trusts Snape enough to risk death when she goes to ask Snape to assist Draco. Perhaps she only went to him because he was in a position to help; but that's an awfully large risk for someone that you don't have other, more personal reasons to trust them. Being Draco's favorite teacher is not enough to overcome the fact that most of the rest of the inner circle did not trust Snape in regards to his loyalty to Voldemort.

It's completely true that he manipulates and guides Harry's life, but one of the things he tries to manipulate Harry's life into being is ordinary or unburdened (something like that anyway). That's why he doesn't tell Harry about the prophecy earlier (he specifically says this in King's Cross). This is much more like paternalistic reasoning.

The Greater Good would suggest sticking Harry in a boot camp and training him as a child soldier or assassin, X-23 style. The closest you get to that is the first book.^{1}

^{1} Can we just talk about this for a minute? Fluffy must be immune to pretty much any magic since otherwise nothing in the book makes sense. The Devil's Snare kills Bode, iirc, in OOTP, which implies it's dangerous and, critically, rare. That Hermione knows what it is suggests nothing more than Hermione's obsessiveness and ignorance of magic... she reads about everything because she doesn't know what's important to read about (hence not knowing what mudblood means). I know they reference Professor Sprout and Harry assumes it's from Herbology but Hermione may have just asked her. It's a defensible trap is what I'm saying. The flying keys do seem an actually bad defence but, on the other hand, wizards aren't very logical... which is how they decide which key to look for. The logic trap is also used by Snape, which rather implies it's probably a true critique of wizarding society. The transfigured chess pieces. Let's talk about their ELO for a minute. That we know Ron can beat them doesn't tell us how good they actually are. For all we know Ron could be another Capablanca, Alekhine or whatever. It could actually be a very good defence.

This is only true if you believe there's some alternative means of extracting the Horcrux, which Dumbledore can assume is not the case because of the basilisk venom incident.

Dumbledore doesn't create a martyr, but instead tricks a self-sacrificing and (in some ways) pessimistic young man into a situation which Dumbeldore believes the "martyr" will survive. There's absolutely no reason to believe that Harry couldn't have burnt himself and Voldemort to a crisp via Fiendfyre.

Was Harry self-sacrificing prior to Dumbledore's (Hogwarts based) interference? Probably, yes. Look at the flying lesson. All Harry wants to do at this stage is have nothing to do with the Dursleys... he puts that on the line right then. At this point, either everything is all Dumbledore and we have no basis to know what Harry would be like, or we have to accept Dumbledore did not create Harry's personality.

You said it yourself too, Dumbledore tricks a person that is self-sacrificing and pessimistic into saving the entirety of the Wizarding world just because a prophecy says it has to be him. It's a form of Manipulation, by using one's personality to manipulate the person into another's doing. In all words, doing the dirty work of one person without the other knowing.

Yeah. Because Voldemort only got by Fluffy because Hagrid was drunk. A devil's snare was used to assassinate a patient in St Mungos (which requires high level herbology). We have no idea how difficult the chess set is (can you beat Magnus Carlsen? I think not. But maybe Ron could) and the logic puzzle was designed to defeat wizards (as opposed to muggle raised individuals). The Mirror was only defeated /because/ Harry was there.

Maybe these protections are a lot better than you think? The only reason to believe they're bad is by deciding they're bad /a priori/ or doing what most fanfics do and concluding it's possible to fly over the chess set. Based on canon?

Utilitarianism:  A family of consequentialist ethical theories that promotes actions that maximize happiness and well-being for the affected individuals.

Yes it's true that Dumbledore cares about his well-being, now wouldn't that include him checking up to Harry regularly at the Dursleys to make sure he's fine? I'll leave you to that.

#+begin_quote

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

No it doesn't, I mean you don't expect a student to go down and help a situation that really shouldn't be handled by them, let alone three 11-12 year old kids.

#+begin_quote
  Yeah. Because Voldemort only got by Fluffy because Hagrid was drunk.
#+end_quote

Quirrel just needed to look into Care of Magical Creatures section for that piece of information, or read about Orpheus about that.

#+begin_quote
  We have no idea how difficult the chess set
#+end_quote

There's no saying what sort of enchantments are on the chess at, if the transfigured chess pieces can blow each other into rubble so easily then any second year up can blow it up with a simple bombarda.

If that doesn't work we still can't judge on Ron's chess skills too much because other than a few Gryffindor students he didn't play chess with anyone else. It's easy to learn what other's moves are if you are actually into chess.

  A devil's snare was used to assassinate a patient in St Mungos (which requires high level herbology).
#+end_quote

It was taught in //first year// herbology class everyone knows how to defeat it

#+begin_quote
  logic puzzle was designed to defeat wizards (as opposed to muggle raised individuals)
#+end_quote

All potions and wine have distinct smells, if that doesn't work then transfigure an animal to test put what's in the bottles, and since Quirrel already got over the fire and there still potion left it's safe to assume it's self refilling, so even after you test out all of them you will still have some left.

Besides if they went down with a Ravenclaw student the logic puzzles wouldn't be a problem.

#+end_quote

The Mirror was a smart contraption that is actually the only smart thing to trap Voldemort in. But other than that the others are quite easy.

#+begin_quote
  Literally the one obstacle we know was put in not to be an obstacle.
#+end_quote

That was only because Quirrel already knocked it out. If he hadn't and the troll regained consciousness it would've been the situation I mentioned.

#+begin_quote
  Er, no. That's the opposite of my point. I'm saying what wizards consider "too dangerous" has no resemblance to what we do.
#+end_quote

What they consider dangerous is mixed with bigotry, religious stuff, politics and corruption. Buckbeak is not dangerous at all yet they still decided to "kill" him because Lucius Malfoy ordered them to do so, he is also one of the major factors why corruption is rooted deep in the ministry. Thestrals are another sample of it, they are completely harmless yet because of beliefs and fear they rule it as what they call "dangerous" creatures. While some of their categories may be correct such as dragons.

What they see as dangerous most of the time are dangerous but if used correctly it isn't, a knife itself is completely harmless but the way a person use it determines how "dangerous" it is. It's like a strong repulse can cause blunt trauma if strong enough, and those are fatal, yet they still teach it in charms.

Yes, because paternalism means actually looking after someone's best interests? No it doesn't and you know it. It means acting in what you think is someone's best interest. Which, in this case, means putting Harry where he's safe, i.e. the Dursleys. Which, in this case, means making sure Harry doesn't grow up a celebrity, i.e. separating Harry from the magical world (which also has the effect of making him even safer).

It's a pathetically easy case.

Yes, this is my point. You need Ron to be objectively poor at chess for the trap to fail. You can't know this, you admit you can't know this, and yet act like you do know this.

Good work.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Nope. Hermione mentions Sprout. Harry says it's in herbology but he didn't recognise it. And our other bit of evidence is that it got into St Mungos... including after being seen by people who were nearly killed by it.

Hell, it may even be the case that only First Years are likely to recognise it... that's a more reasonable explanation of the evidence than "everyone knows how to defeat it" which isn't actually the same as "everyone knows how to escape it".

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

hahahaha

oh, wait, ur serious

wtf

How is is safe to assume it's refilling? I mean, sure, maybe you can dance in and out of the room with a trial and error method. Maybe it works like that. But we also don't know if you can actually trial and error using conjured animals... nor, indeed, is it the case that what's good for the goose is good for the gander.

The only way you can trial and error that system and be sure, is by imperioing other people (since conjuring humans seems impossible). And that is, of course, assuming it refills in any fashion (which it probably does since three people get there... although possibly Dumbledore had his own personal supply).

#+begin_quote

#+begin_quote

No, it's because Quirrel (the guy trying to break in) was responsible for one of the layers of defence. It's a bad defence because the person who chose it doesn't want it to be a good one.

#+begin_quote
  But other than that the others are quite easy.
#+end_quote

Well, yes, of course they're easy if you presuppose that they're easy. But if you take them at face value, it's hard to conclude that they are easy. /Of course/ they're easy... Harry and his friends get through them. Er, no, maybe there's something special about Harry and his friends. How do you tell which interpretation is correct?

Your answer? Assume that Ron's bad at chess (having no evidence for this), that a plant used to assassinate a wizard later on is actually not a big deal, that Fluffy is an easily researched question (despite Voldemort's having to resort to tricking Hagrid... Voldemort! well known wizarding genius) and that there are a whole bunch of loopholes to a logic puzzle (and, hey, we do know Barty Crouch jr is good at lateral thinking so maybe Voldemort was too). The point is... the only reason you have to believe these assumptions is the conclusion you want these assumptions to demonstrate. That's a terrible argument.

(And, indeed, we do know that is the case... see: the mirror.)

#+begin_quote
  help a situation that really shouldn't be handled by them
#+end_quote

We've established that the only reason to put in the age line is to keep the pupils safe. We have also established that wizards don't consider Fluffy to be overly dangerous. So... why would they put an age line to prevent access to a security measure we're told only Dumbledore and Hagrid know how to circumvent when we have no evidence to believe they're actually worried about Fluffy's hurting pupils? It makes things extra safe? This is in the same book that tells us wizards aren't logical.

#+begin_quote
  Buckbeak is not dangerous at all yet they still decided to "kill" him because Lucius Malfoy ordered them to do so
#+end_quote

Yes, precisely. We're meant to believe that Buckbeak isn't dangerous. If a dog attacked a child at a school... even if the child was being stupid... we'd destroy it. Really not sure what you think you're saying here.

#+begin_quote
  It's like a strong repulse can cause blunt trauma if strong enough, and those are fatal, yet they still teach it in charms.
#+end_quote

How you think this helps your case escapes me.

You: Fluffy is too dangerous! Me: Fluffy is clearly not something wizards are overly concerned about... look at all these dangerous things wizards don't give two hoots about. You: Here are some more of those dangerous things wizards don't give two hoots about.

Hey, I guess that was your point... that "dangerous" is a label that the completely corrupt wizarding society allows to be applied via what passes for their political processes. Well, okay, clearly Quirrel should have been manipulating the political processes to have Fluffy destroyed (if, indeed, that's actually possible) instead of acting how he did. Are you actually surprised one of the most important figures in this corrupt society (i.e. Dumbledore) decides to just stick Fluffy in a school? It's a corrupt society that appears to endorse rule breaking for your own ends.

I mean, hell, Sirius tried to murder Snape when he was a teenager and no-one cares particularly... it's not even Snape's worst memory. Judging anything in it by the standards of the real world is clearly completely insane.

And how are you going to prove that Harry was safe? There wasn't much of a description other than Harry being locked in every single summer by the Dursleys and the dementor attack outside the wards which should have worked because his life was being threatened by it. And if you mean the Dursley's are a safe place to put Harry in then what is it with the emotional and occasional physical abuse then? As for not growing up arrogant simply place him with someone he knew wouldn't spoil Harry too much and discipline him when he should be? Hell even at Neville's too, he could stay there, or the Tonks. People believe Voldemort is dead so safety wouldn't be too much of an issue. Or he could live in Hogwarts which I quote , “Is the safest place in earth other than Gringotts.” McGonagall can raise him right, he can even get some training too!

no one truly knows how and that would be JKR's fault, she didn't explain thorough enough, to her it's just convient that the chess set is there and most people's first instinct to do so is to play through it, while the others would've tried to find alternatives.

#+begin_quote

It's either this or McGonagall preset the chess to make the easiest move whenever the other player made theirs. It's kind of like those games on a tablet where you can set difficulty and McGonagall set it to easy.

Which basically indicates that it was taught in first year, both Harry and Hermione pays attention in class but can only vaguely remember Sprout mentioning it due to the stress of the situation. Most people panic when they are “strangled” by devil's snare and forget about what they were taught about it.

Are you actually serious about this, conjuring humans? I meant conjuring animals not humans don't jump into conclusions. It's one of the five games law of transfiguration you CAN'T CONJURE OR TRANSFIGURÉ HUMANS. First years learn to transfigure cauldron to cats, which basically can work on anything after you master the spell.

#+end_quote

Hermione said so herself wizards don't use logic. We're here originally debating about Dumbledore's competence, but now here we are arguing about things that JKR did a horrible job at writing it clear about. Voldemort is too proud and his pride was his eventual downfall, he didn't bother asking Quirrell to research, but rather resorting to drastic ways to get the information, Quirrell also could've just wen town to Hagrid's hut and lure him into telling him, but stupidity ensued and hence getting Hagrid drunk.

#+begin_quote
  Yes, precisely. We're meant to believe that Buckbeak isn't dangerous. If a dog attacked a child at a school... even if the child was being stupid... we'd destroy it. Really not sure what you think you're saying here.
#+end_quote

While a dog might be alive creatures too, it's entirely different from a Hippogriff as Hippogriffs fully understands what a human says and is extremely prideful, they attack, like humans when they are insulted. Buckbeak's execution was also due to corruption of course, without hearing testimony from other witnesses but Draco Malfoy's.

If anything, I'd rather you not start another sub-branch argument out of something that we don't know much about other than from Snape's perspective of the day's event. So let's leave it there.
