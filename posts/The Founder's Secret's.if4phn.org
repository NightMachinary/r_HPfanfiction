** Wow! This is a fun story that takes a good dark twist at the end. Lots of creativity and a nice effort at capturing the personalities and feelings of the founders. The main serious issue is that it needs editing: there are a lot of small spelling and grammar errors.

If English is not your first language, you did fine telling the story; but either way, you should get some help from a beta reader (someone who reads the story and checks for errors before you publish it) to handle these minor issues. Keep writing and practicing and you'll get better and better!
