** That probably wouldn't work as he was not a licensed medical worker. Plus this is the wizard world we are talking about shit like this happens every day.

*** The fact that he wasn't a licensed medical worker might get him into trouble of its own. Plus, Harry refused consent to the treatment, which means it was basically assault.

***** If you're going for the civil tort, sure. Where I'm from, the crime of assault includes actual harm.

*** You can still be sued for negligence if you're not a medical professional!

(Warning: technical legal stuff ahead)

To show negligence, you need to show that you owe someone a duty to care for them (Lockhart is a teacher, so that's a given); that the duty was breached (would a reasonable teacher have tried to mend his arm rather than take him to the school nurse) and that the breach caused the injury (which is fairly obvious let's be honest).

TL;DR: Harry could totally sue

**** You don't even need the teacher status to get to duty -- that's fulfilled by the simple fact of GL affirmatively involving himself in the first place, same as any bystander in your garden-variety roadway accident.

Also, elements for battery are def there. Just not medical battery since as discussed, not licensed

***** Very true!! Also false imprisonment, considering Harry tried to get away but Lockhart wouldn't let him.

** Something along those lines happens in this fic. It's only a small part of the story but I recommend the series it's part of in general.
