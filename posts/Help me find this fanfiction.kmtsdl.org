I'm looking for a fanfiction where Neville and Harry kill Voldemort and then tell everyone where they can shove it. It was Weasley bashing and dumbledore bashing.


** Was it Harry potter and marriage contracts? The weasleys dont comenoff the best and Neville and harry keep coming up with more and more outlandish stories about how they beat Voldemort just to mess with Dumbledore
