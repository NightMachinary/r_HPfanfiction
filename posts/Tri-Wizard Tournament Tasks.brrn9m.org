I've had this idea for a Fic for awhile now, but I'm having trouble coming up with TriWiz Tasks. Anyone have any ideas to help me brainstorm?


** Well, who is organising it? The minstry or others? Are they incompetent like in canon? How hard should the challenges be? How deadly? Focus on spells, creatures, cursebreaking, flying, knowledge, duels, what? Should they compete one at a time, or together? Timebased? Completion based? Is voldemort behind it? Does the last task need to include a portkey? Is the tasks the main focus of the year?

Give us a bit of info of what you want from the tasks, should help both us and you to figure out what you want:D

** If you want inspiration for different tasks for the champions to complete [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/][Patron]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/][Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon]] have some good alternative tasks. One thing similar between the two is the idea of having 4 tasks with each task representing one of the classical elements (fire, water, air, earth)

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

** The first fic in the Black Queen series by Silently Watches has some different tasks. I remember there was a duel and something about tokens and fortresses, also challenge rooms instead of a maze and a glass 3D maze.

I can't really remember though, there may have been others, you may get some ideas or inspiration from there.
