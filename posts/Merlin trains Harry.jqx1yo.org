Does anyone know any fics where Harry is trained by Merlin. They are my guilty pleasure fics. I'm fine with any pairings except for snarry and hinny. Thanks in advance.


** There are 2 I know of

First is linkffn(basilisk born by ebenbild)

Second is

linkffn(harry potter and the heir of the founders by sinyk)

I'm not a fan of the 2nd as all the main characters sound like obnoxious kids

Basilisk born is a classic though

** It was a crispy night, full of uncertainty in the air. Harry was nervous, he knew he had to be aware. He could come at him any moment now.

He thought he heard the sound of footsteps on his right, so he hurried in the opposite direction. He raced through the brushes, wary of the very trees around him. He crossed a small stream,and looked for coverage.

His breathing was uneven, he knew, but it shouldn't take long. He should be able to apparate away on the small town across the old tracks.

"Bugger. Now or never!"

He turned to both sides and strode forward. As if his very life depended on it. He thought he was going to make it when. His foot touched the tracks, but he should have know better. Two heartbeat later, a moustrous whistle came, followed by a blinding light. Harry barely had time to turn to it before Merlin guided the Hogwarts Express to ride through him.

The last thing Harry heard before the train killed him was the victory howl of the old wizard.
