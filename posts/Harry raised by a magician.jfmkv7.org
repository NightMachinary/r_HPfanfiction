Someone famous enough to go onstage or just an unimportant street magician. Either one works if you can find one. I'd love to see them try to capitalize on his accidental magic. And the irony of a real magic user taking after a fake would be utterly hilarious.


** This would be interesting, especially if Petunia was the magician. If she can't learn real magic, she'll have to make do.

** I like it. Have Harry seem to do impossible things with magic that just turn out to be cheap tricks.

** Pretty sure there's a few DC crossovers where he raised by one of the Zatarras, although I'm not sure any of them were finished. Would that count?

*** Just checked and I only found a single unfinished fem!harry fic (only 1 chapter so probably a one-shot) but yeah it counts. I don't really care if the magician actually does have magic or not, as long as Harry (or fem-Harry) is raised as one.

** I remember one story I read quite some time ago, which had Harry running away with a brother and sister. The sister turned out to have magic, and she and Harry performed as street magicians while the brother worked under an aging glamour they applied. That's about all I remember of it.

*** I'll have to search for it, then. Here's hoping I can find it.
