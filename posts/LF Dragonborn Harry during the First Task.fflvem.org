I've seen plenty of Elder Scrolls crossovers, but I've never seen Harry either end up killing the Dragon and finding out he's a Dragonborn, or already knowing he's a Dragonborn, and just shouting at the Dragon.


** What are your favourites? Care to share some? I'm interested.

** While its not there yet, linkffn(11797476) has 13 year old Harry summoned to Skyrim to be the Dragonborn. Author has said that they will eventually go back to Earth, but will run through most of the Skyrim quest lines first.

*** There's another one in this vein, Linkffn(the length and breadth of skyrim), I think. It's a long title, but it has a very similar prompt to the one you linked, except it's hermione instead. A very interesting character study.

Haven't seen anything like the OP requested, but it sounds pretty cool.

  Cast into an unfamiliar world, with only the memories of her spells and best friend, can Hermione beat the odds and find a way home? AU on both sides of the fence.

  When the True Dragonborn is killed by the Thalmor before uncovering his true nature, Sheogorath comes up with a crazy plan and Akatosh takes some drastic measures. Now, Harry is stuck in a world he knows nothing about, with nothing to his name but a pair of glasses and a black dragon that wants him very dead. What a start...
