I'm having such fun writing about the pets of the main characters in my long fic, giving them personalities and using them for comedic moments and major feels.

What I really want to read but don't have time to write myself is a Crookshanks/Pigwigeon buddy cop type tale where they're secretly the heroes of every significant even that happens in canon.

I like the idea they can speak to each other and other animals but not humans (or chose not to talk to humans) because humans don't understand them.

Just Hedwig, but you could argue she's the Power He Knows Not.

  Hedwig is a very smart owl; none would dare deny that! So what is a very smart owl to do when she finds her human's living conditions unsatisfactory? Finding a new home is top of the list. Finding a mate for him is right after it. After all how is an owl supposed to justify having owlets if her human hasn't had children of his own yet? Very much a humor fic, no bashing of anyone.

** It's not like that, but a story about pets if you haven't read it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11695364/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Fabulous-Cowpig]]

There are mostly OC animal characters in it, but Crookshanks and Scabbers also appear. Pigwigeon isn't in it if I remember correctly.
