I have read hundreds of stories where Harry tries to run away from the world.... and in the end he always manages to crawl back. I was just rereading Behind Blue Eyes and some things resonated with me before it became awful. The biggest one was Tonks getting a message to Harry that Remus was worried, and that Sirius would be disappointed in him. What a fucking terrible thing to say first of all... But more importantly untrue. I doubt Sirius would be anything but supportive of Harry trying to leave.

They are asking a 15 year old kid to stand up and defeat the Boogeyman. Running away is rarely the answer, and has some pretty harsh consequences long term.... but this is a situation where I think it is justified. I hate stories that have a huge runaway setup with no payoff.

So any stories where Harry runs... and stays gone? Escapes to a different country and lives the rest of his days as a free man? Britain either figures things out or falls, doesn't really matter to me. I would also like a story where Harry refuses to participate in the Tri-wizard tournament... and actually loses his magic.

I guess I am just tired of stories with tons of build up... and then clever "No consequences here, status quo everyone."

** Linkffn(harry potter and the power of paranoia) has a great setup for getting him away, and he does stay away, but it kind of loses something after the initial rush. Although I did like the solution for keeping Dumbledore out of his life at the end. Without killing him.

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.
