Under "without special treatment" I mean than if a Hero is allowed to do something, it means that others are allowed to do it too under the same circumstances.

This is a list of such examples:

- if a 3rd year Gryffindor is given a time turner for educational purposes, then at least half of Ravenclaws use them too;
- if schoolchildren are allowed to use time turners, then adults also heavily use them for different purposes (research, extending working hours, criminal activities, etc.);
- if students are allowed to have cats in the school, Hogwarts is overwhelmed with them (I think at least one girl in every House in every year will have it);
- if a school student found information about horcruxes in the school library, then every other old Dark family has one or more books about them;
- if a underaged wizard was able to create a horcrux with killing a muggle, most of Dark families members have one properly hidden (who cares about muggles?);
- if wizards and witches live significantly longer than muggles, then there're a lot of gran- and gran-gran- parents for pure- and half-blood children;
- if the magical society is not democratic, it's ruled by old generation (in our world Prince Charles is 69 years old already and he is still just prince), Dumbledore isn't the only old man in power;
- if Obliviate and Polyjuice are part of the school program, then they are commonly used by children and adults in their everyday life (Lockhart isn't the only one);
- if there're 3 wizards who can read thoughts, then there're a lot more of such wizards and witches (it is a very useful skill);
- if Riddle could use taboo to locate anyone who says his nickname, then it's heavily used by the Ministry (e.g. to track Unforgivables or Morsmordre);
- if a bunch of schoolchildren can broke into the Ministry and the Department of Mysteries at night without meeting anyone, every other wizard or witch did it at least once;
- if 3 schoolchildren became animagi by themselves than they are not the only ones and some others did it successfully too;
- (fanon) if Potter-Black heir is required to have a wife for each line, then there's no extinct families in Magical World: Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, Slytherin, Peverell, etc. are living families, because the same was required for their non-direct heirs;

Are there any such stories?

It's very unpleasant when you return in the evening and find a small mountain of cat shit on you bed.

Or pissed bag, shoes, other clothes in the morning.

Or loud demands of a female cat in heat at night (constant decline of that is not healthy for them too).

Or constant fighting between males for a female attention.

Or ruined clothes.

The list is endless.

It will also lead to tension between cat owners when something nasty is found again.

Not mentioning that Hogwarts students are teenagers and being responsible owners is the last thing in the mind of most of them.

P. S.: I would like to see Hermione's reaction if she known that there's a dedicated house elf who constantly monitors her Crookshanks and cleans for him.

P. P. S.: I think it's a very bad lesson for a teenager to constantly rely on 3rd party (house elves) for taking care of his/her pet. It totally contradicts to educational part of pet ownership.

*** That's not /quite/ right though, if I may go off on a tangent. The rules say "an owl /or/ a cat /or/ a toad"; this means if they have one they can't have another one off that list; but other pets than just owls, cats and toads are allowed.

If a disease takes a huge amount of people (the whole generation?), it's a pandemic, which is a huge occurrence.

I can understand when Dark side is ruthless towards Light families. Still it means that Dark families has a lot more survivals.

**** May be you are right, But the problem with canon is we only see it through protagonist point of view, he doesn't explore much ( because it is ingrained into him: never to ask questions, never to be seen, no friends will stay with you..). The only adults he knows are the Weasleys, Sirius, professors, and OOtP, and the common thing in all of them are belligerents in a conflict, who stand up for their beliefs. That's why he finds it astonishing that majority of people with sheep mentality, because he don't know anyone different.\\
I think these families are heavily targeted for their outspoken beliefs, that's why we don't get to see any elders there. Regarding Grindelwald war, i don't think only Dumbledore participated in it. In magical world with government showing a blind eye the conflict descended in to conflict between families, akin to mafia wars, combined with a parallel WW2 it might have become a matter of personal glory and adventure for young wizards of British of that era to go to front lines, while not a significant number, it might be still a good number enough to mount a effective resistance.

I'm not sure about Voldemort's First war. Dark side was winning and their loses should be significantly less that Light side's, because they weren't restricted by moral.

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.
