Basically I want a story that covers what happens between the end of the Deathly Hallows and the epilogue. I need something that is going to fill in that gap for me! I am not interested in any Next Gen fics because I am waiting on the next James Potter series book to fill my urge on that. I just want to find out what happens after. Read about everyone's weddings, where they live, their jobs, having babies. How Neville courts Hannah, how everyone copes with the losses of their friends and families.

One shots are fine, but I would really like something novel length. As close to canon as possible!

Provide me with some tips on searching for my specifications on one of the websites if you want, because I have a hard time sifting through the vast amount of fanfictions on them.

Thanks!


** [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=232569][Learning to Live Again]] is one of my all-time favorites. It begins the morning after the battle and runs for a couple of years afterward. It also has an excellent sequel called Thirty-One Bottles.

*** I haven't left canon that far yet, maybe thy dash of Draco/Hermione will give me the courage. Thanks for the link!
