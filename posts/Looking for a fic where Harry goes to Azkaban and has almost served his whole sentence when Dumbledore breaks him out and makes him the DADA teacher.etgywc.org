:END:
Neville's son is a big character and there is a manhunt going on looking for Harry but secretly he is the DADA professor. I remember that his room is really colourful to "make up for his lack of childhood" and at the end of the fic he proves his innocence. Thanks!

Edit: I found it, it's called Under Suspicion by Ottilchen

  Harry Potter certainly never expected to be visited that night, but he learns he is needed, and he is needed now. He becomes a new person so he is safe while he is helping. What will being home again be like from an entirely new perspective? Can he help?
