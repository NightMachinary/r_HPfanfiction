I'll be honest, reading about different tropes makes me laugh so hard!!! I get obscene delight when I see them in subsequent fics. My most frustrating one is when someone calls Hermione "Mione".

I never realized there were so many in this world of fanfiction! Please share your favorites (or just any!) below!

** The Goblet of fire cannot bind me because nobody knows my true name. I am Hararaldr-Lokisson-Evans-Potter-Black not Harry Potter!

** [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FandomSpecificPlot/HarryPotter]]

That list covers most of the common tropes, and most are annoying as fuck because their inclusion ruins perfectly good stories otherwise, for example the "pureblood customs" in Rune Stone Path (or any other fic tbh).

In my opinion, the worst offenders are any sort of pureblood elitism (be it through customs, politics or society as a whole), harems (because the girls are reduced to their bodies and a single quality while the character development approaches 0) and depicting the Death Eaters as anything but the war criminals and murderers they were.

Bashing, in a serious matter, is just horrible, but if you turn the crack up to 11, it can be hilarious if done well. I fondly remember a German parody where Slytherin House as a whole was gay, Quidditch was teleshopping, Dumbledore was a rapper called Fresh D and everyone was a fucking pervert at 11/12.

** In my opinion Mione is pretty okay. While its mentioned only once in canon, i find it incredibly unrealistic that her friends always call her by her full four syllable long name

*** Exactly.. If literally everybody shortens Ronald, Percival and William it seems strange that they wouldn't do it for Hermione too.. and IMO 'Mione seems more palatable and less juvenile than Hermi

**** Actually, I'm pretty sure that Percy's first name really is Percy, not Percival, but your point remains.

*** Maybe I'm just being my Appalachian self and dropping syllables, but even after the movies I've always thought it as "Her-my-knee." Or maybe I'm just Viktor Krum...
