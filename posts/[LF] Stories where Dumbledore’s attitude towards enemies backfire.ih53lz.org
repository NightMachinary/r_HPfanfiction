  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

*** The fact that so many people were able and willing to show up at the graveyard that quickly tells its own story, throw in the fact that Snape's spiel worked and Draco was free to cause as much havoc as he was in attempting to kill Dumbledore.. And Slytherin House as a whole never seemed to get into trouble because Snape protected them and Dumbledore in turn protected him.. I also don't believe we hear about any instances where The Order manages to harm the Death Eaters, although I am happy to be proven wrong..

***** It was, but the fact that Dumbledore couldn't or didn't do something to stop it from happening to the extent that it did rubs me the wrong way.. I don't believe for a second that Dumbledore, being as powerful, well connected and personally influential as he was, could not have forced through genuine trials for more people than we saw in the books.. I think he was too preoccupied with the prophesy to insure justice for everyone who lost life, limb or loved ones.. Which seems even more nuts when you consider the fact that he believes Voldemort to be out there still.. One would think that making sure that Tom had as few people on standby for his eventual return would be right up there alongside researching immortality..

****** I mean Fudge was able to take the Chief Warlock position from him, why couldn't he also keep DE out of Azkaban? It's blatently obvious that Lucius has him in his pocket, so going by that logic, Fudge beats Dumbledore politically.

Edit: I assume not, had she been, she would have ended up as Voldemort's puppet á la Pius Thicknesse and he would in all likelihood have control..

******* Fudge was able to do so because Dumbledore enabled him, covering for his inept leadership with daily owls until Fudge decides he no longer needs help and turns on him. Plus I suspect there is some truth to the guess that he simply did not care about being ousted. Dumbledore still controlled Harry, which is all that mattered for his plan. Let them think they were winning, it was an acceptable inconvenience.

******** Mabe. I guess there are multiple schools of thought on this. Don't get me wrong, I know that Dumbledore was pretty damn manipulative, but considering the end goal, it seemed acceptable. Well apart from the Dursleys. Then you could say he either wanted a moldable pawn, or he truly believed in familial love. I've always see sawed on that though. Hre ae solid arguments for each. Although what Dumbledore said about knowing he would be going through dark, and difficult years. I lends credence to the moldable pawn theory.

********* Alternatively, re. Dursleys... Dumbledore was 100% convinced that keeping him there behind the Bond of Blood charm is the only thing to keep him alive. This could have completely averted so many shitty cliche in fanfiction with a single line. "Between the ages of 2 and 8 the charm averted no fewer than X attempts on your life"

********* If Harry had liked Mrs. Figg at all, then Dumbledore was nieve. But Mrs. Figg somehow ends up coming off as complicit in underfeeding Harry and keeping him repressed and suppressed in general. To me, the fact that she was a squib pretty much means that Dumbledore knew enough to know that as a government official he should intervene. When you factor in the damage to his own sister from muggles who did not accept magic, it becomes even worse.

********** Yeah, I guess. I never liked Dumbledore as a character, because JK kind of dug herself a hole with him. You can't have him be a very influential, competant, and powerful wizard, and then just breeze over such things without giving a reason. From our point of view, he seems like a manipulative old man who doesn't see people as people, but as chess pieces. He's ruthless, and while there is a somewhat valid reason for that(Voldemort having almost won before Lily stopped him), it doesn't mean it's a victory worth having. I think there's a saying about victory at too great a cost to morals.

#+end_quote

The story is that Death Eaters were tried by the Council of Magical Law, which was headed by Bartemius Crouch Sr, who was responsible for the Death Eaters roaming free after the 1st war.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Battle of the Seven Potters Tonks mentions hurting and probably killing Rodolphus. If we're including Moody in the Order, he kills Evan Rosier.

*** Dumbledore specifically was never put in a situation in which he had the need of killing or even doing anything particularly nasty to his enemies (even the whole capturing instead of killing deal at OotP can be attributed more to pragmatism than anything else) and while at first sight he seems to be given second chances to anyone it could all be explained in other ways, Snape brought him important information and agreed to spy for him, Draco was more of an unwittingly helper for his euthanasia and we have no idea if he even could have done anything at all to put more DE in Azkaban.

What we do see is that the order did use lethal force in battle and during HBP also berated Harry for not doing the same, if we assume that they were operating normally during that particular incident and that they operated based on Dumbledore's instructions then we can conclude that he at the very least didn't forbid it, he probably instructed them to fight without holding back even if he didn't outright tell them to kill.
