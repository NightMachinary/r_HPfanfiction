If you have such a fic then please, send me one. If not try to come up with a scene with such a Albus Dumbledore. I don't mean it in a way of like a high Dumbledore saying: "Harry you did some crazy sh!t, 50 points do Gryffindore", but rather an over enthusiastic knowledge sharing Dumbledore. Possibly a bit inebriated Dumbledore, but not Trlawney drunk, for sure. I would also prefer if the wisdom of Dumbledore wouldn't be about magic but more like he was in the first book. With "love being the most powerful force", or "socks are the best Christmas present", but crank it up to eleven.

"Ah, Bertie Bott's every flavour beans... I was most unfortunate in my youth to come upon a vomit flavour one... And since them I've lost my liking for them... But I think, I could be safe, with a nice toffee... Mmm. Alas. Earwax..." -said Dumbledore at the end of the PS, and left Harry in the Hogwart's infirmary. However in my version the scene would continue, with Albus saying: "*BUT WHAT A VINTAGE! Two, no three hours after a shower Harry, the best time for a earwax snack. The moistness, the texture! This has got to be the best earwax I've ever tasted. Blast!.. Now I see why the cockroaches think it a delicacy, Harry! Do you understand Harry?! It is so much better than a vomit flavour one, Harry. My relief is truly... Overwhelming". - Albus feints from being overwhelmed with relief.*

PS: Besides PKA 493 is one of a most entertaining video podcasts I've ever seen.


** Dumbledore would most likely be high off lemon drops.

** Dumbledore, after years of taking hard substances, has to move on to stronger stuff like lemon drops in order to keep down his notorious alter ego *Gellert Grindelwald*
