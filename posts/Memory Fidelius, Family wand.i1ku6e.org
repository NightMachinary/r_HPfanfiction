:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I'm looking for this fic where Harry is taken to a goblin shaman in Gringotts by Bill. He examines Harry and apparently there is a part of his memory that's under a fidelius!

While going through his vault he finds a wand that apparently holds a part of him (a pseudo horcrux I suppose?) it just so happens to be a family wand used by his ancestor.

Also there is a portrait of him looking much different with i think a very odd title. I think it was the pale horseman/horseman of the apocalypse. Don't remember exactly. But there is a portrait of him that looks very regal and different but he doesn't remember every getting one made.

Any idea which fic?

  Memories are tricky things. Sometimes, they cause us to lose nights of sleep. Sometimes, they bring light to darkness. Sometimes, they change the course of destiny. Set after the events of Fourth year. Follow Harry Potter as he finds his way across his strange problems, his notoriety and of course, the resurrected dark lord trying to kill him.
