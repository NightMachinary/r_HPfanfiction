*** I read these, and was enjoying them. Then the [[/spoiler][special wish jewels came]] and I was thinking, this is weird, but ok. I'll roll with it. I kept going, enjoying most of the story, getting into it. Then [[/spoiler][sirius' wife got obliviated and he turned squibish and got locked as padfoot, and it kind of hinted she was being used as a sex toy and when she finally got her memories back and sirius his magic back she decided she wasn't the same person and left him]]. I kinda rage quit. I don't mind some angst, but that was too much for me. I was on edge already from the whole [[/spoiler][remus is banned from seeing the kids and draco is being poisoned/brainwashed at the notts]] bit, and the other part put me over the edge.

I think I only had one book left. I really liked the premise, the pack, animagus stuff, and the prophecies. It was a great world, but had too much angst.

Ps, did you read it all? If you feel like it, I wouldn't mind being convinced I should finish it - Iirc I only had one book left. Maybe 2? Its been a while.

**** I read it all but honestly I started when I was 14 and it was more of a emotional connection sms like a real accomplishment when it finally was finished. It definitely was most angsty in the last book. For me I started not liking the world and the pack and the prophecies but I stuck out for the characters

** Against the Moon has been fantastic so far. Be warned that it's super long and not anywhere near completion (105 chapters in and they're only at the end of second year).

  The odds were stacked against him: a child from a blended home with no friends, no social skills to speak of, and a terrible secret. Yet slowly Remus Lupin began to realize there was a place for him in the world, if he could find the courage to claim it.

  Remus Lupin didn't graduate from Hogwarts to become an odd-jobs man. He always knew he would be fighting the good fight, he just didn't know on which side of the Law. In the end,he made his own side.
