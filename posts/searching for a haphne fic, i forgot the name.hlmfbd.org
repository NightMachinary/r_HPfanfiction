*** it starts between 4th and 5th year, harrys friendship with ron and hermione isn't existing anymore after they are back to hogwarts, harry and sirius kinda keep to themselves at grimmauld place, sirius tells kreacher that harry is the heir of the blacks, harry is behaving dark and like a "pureblood heir" because the hocrux inside him merges with him and he gets voldemorts memories, at hogwarts he gets every spell right after the first try because of the memories...
