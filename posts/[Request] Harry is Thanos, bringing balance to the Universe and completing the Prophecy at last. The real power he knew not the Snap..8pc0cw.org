** "Hey Ginny. I've come to save you all, which, for some reason, entails killing half of you. So! Which 4 members of your family will you part with?"

"Easy, Harry. Charlie, Percy, and the twins."

"...Ok, you're going to have to explain that to me. Except for Percy. I know he's a dick."

"I mean, Charlie has barely appeared in these 7 years of our lives. He has no romantic connections, unlike Bill, and honestly no one will be too sad to see him go."

"Right. But really. The twins?"

"They're low-key dicks too, you know. Their experiments could have killed us all, so I say they're fair game. Also, killing only one of them would be cruel to the other, so one fell swoop would be fine."

"...Ginny, is there something else?"

"...No."

"Ginny, I know that face. Your 'tells' are showing again."

"Okay, they never sent me that toilet seat they promised me back in first year!"

"Okay, that makes sense."

** Oh. There's actually a request for it here. I just commented less than a minute ago saying this needed to happen...imma upvote so more people see this. Maybe change it to a prompt, but ask if such stories are out there, and if so could they be linked, that way if there aren't any someone may write one.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

** I had a thought a while back about something like this. You could make certain artifacts in the HPverse be like Infinity Stones. Like:

Elder Wand = Power

Invisibility Cloak = Time

Resurrection Stone = Soul

Sorting Hat = Mind

Sword of Gryffindor = Reality

Goblet of Fire = Space

Then the story can be about Harry or whomever collecting all the stuff for the snap.
