What of Voldemort could smell emotion? Maybe he was only a mediocre legilimens, but could smell when people were lying?

What if he hated love because it made everyone smell overpoweringly of cheap air freshener? What if Snape could lie to him because he had excellent parasympathetic control, or maybe he was the only Death Eater who wore deodorant?

I would like to see a fic exploring this.


** Smelling guilt sounds like an easy enough implementation. An emotion detecting spell that works slightly different for everyone. Voldemort learned how to do it wandlessly. When he uses the spell it works by stimulating the olfactory portion of his brain which means he can smell emotions even without a nose. In fact not having a nose makes it even easier because there are less actual smells clouding his sense.

No, no, it's the reverse (come now! the Grim Greasy Git, /deodorant/?). He's so constantly caked in smelly potions residue and general ickiness that Voldemort can't smell his emotions.

***** That's true too! I guess I was thinking of the antipersperant effect of deodorant to prevent the sweating caused by nervousness/guilt/what have you.

*** I am strangely reminded of Roald Dahl's The Witches, what with clean children being easy for the witches to smell, and the odour of dirty children being blocked by all the grime.

*** No no, go full circle. Other wizards are so used to bad smells that Snape's higher level of hygiene is actually unnatural to them, which is why they constantly insult him.

** Once, Voldemort tried cursing his nose off to make it stop, but unfortunately it was actually a form of magical synaesthesia.

He now knows no nose won't help quell the smells well.

**** Constantly waving his tongue around, trying to taste the air. The Death Eaters think it's supposed to be an evil affection, and no one has the balls to tell him it looks ridiculous.
