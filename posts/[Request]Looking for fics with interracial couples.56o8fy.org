  At 17, Andromeda Black thought being in love was everything. At 57, Andromeda Tonks knew better. Yet the first time Kingsley Shacklebolt asked her out, she surprised herself by saying yes.

** I liked *A Bit Unhealthy* (George/Angelina)

They are a canon couple so you will be able to find a few stories featuring them, and some with Fred/Angelina as well (also thought to be a canon couple).

  Post-DH George Weasley/Angelina Johnson, prompted by Rowling's saying of the pairing that "maybe it's a bit unhealthy, but I think that they would've been happy." A writing challenge if I ever saw one.

*** I would like to read some good Harry/Cho fics. IMO, Cho got unjustly maligned in the fandom. The fact that Cho came back to take part in the final battle showed her true character. By that time, she already graduated and was NOT even at school, and she was pretty much thrown out of DA after the Marietta disaster.

*** Not being argumentative or anything, but how is this an interracial pairing? I can see the inter-species but you've really got me stumped on the interracial part.

** Technically, all of my more recent h/hr stories are interracial because my headcanon has always been that hermione was blewish, i just never brought it up but there was thus one story where Harry returns home after years abroad and Hermione is black and he's confused, I'm sure someone will link it

***** Although if Hermione is described as "very brown" after a vacation overseas, then it's possible to infer that she wasn't "very brown" or "brown" previously. But in general there's more room for interpretation, ethnicity-wise, with her than with a lot of other characters.

****** Yes, you're right but if I went out and got a tan, most people would say something along the lines of "very tan/tanned," not "very brown." In my mind, she was brown (or cafe au lait in my headcanon(Like rihanna or Chanel Iman)) already, she just got browner (google rihanna tan lines for a visual).

******* Hmm... that's also possible. I think I had Enid Blyton's description of kids being tanned after vacation in mind, which gives a different mental image.
