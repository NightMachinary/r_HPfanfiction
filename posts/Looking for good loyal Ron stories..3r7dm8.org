So i have only seen like 3 stories where Harry gets screwed in one way or another and Ron sticks with him. Can anyone recommend some good ones? Preferably comedy but any genre is fine.


** In my opinion, linkffn(Forging the Sword by Myst Shadow) has the best trio interaction of all times. Due to the divergence, they're way more serious than in canon, they still have a few disagreements, but they're shaping up to be a team unlike any other.

** I've written a good, loyal Ron in all my HP stories on FFnet. Even in my first story, where he starts out a bit close to the "ignorant of muggles" clichee, and distanced from Harry, they reconcile and Ron ends up a hero. Best of "my" Rons is probably in "Uncle Quentin's Spy". linkffn(11102515) He's also very loyal and good in "Patron".

** linkffn(Invisible Circus by sceneii)

Everything (including Harry) thinks Ron is a traitor. In reality, he's an undercover spy.

*** Changing Ron (and, if slightly less often, Hermione) into someone less likeable is one of the easiest but also cheapest waya to give Harry other friends. It doesn't help that Ron also was badly treated by both the movie, where he lost a number of his best moments to Hermione, and the books, where he went from the kid ready to die for his friends at 12 to the guy who quit over food.

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Cannon to Epilogue, then not so much...
