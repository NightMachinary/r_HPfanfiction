:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
If my memory serves correctly, it's a fanfic based off of Harry not defeating Voldemort, but Voldemort didn't kill Harry. The only detail that I can remember specifically is that Hermione had been captured and enslaved, and that the Death Eaters moved her to a new location every couple months so that the Order wouldn't be able to find her. I think she tries to escape by slitting one of the Lestrange brothers' throats, but he somehow survives? I think there's a scene where she's being moved to a new location in a carriage? Idk? Anywhom, super frustrating that I can't remember anything else about it, if anyone knows the fic I'm talking about please let me know!!


** It's Cruel and Beautiful World by Lena Phoria but the story has been deleted from ffn, however I'm pretty sure you can find pdfs for it online.
