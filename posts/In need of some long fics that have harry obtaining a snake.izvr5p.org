As the title says I'm in need of some long (over 100,00 words) fics that involve harry having a snake as a pet(a basilisk would be nice but not necessary) . Additionally I would like the fic to have no slash


** Have you read antithesis? It's dark, long, and the only WBWL fic I've ever liked. Harry has his own snake he rescues from the zoo, who becomes his best friend. In addition, the basilisk in this fic is a character unto herself.

**** It's kind of like canon in that Harry's character and the story grows more complex with the older he gets so don't let the first couple of chapters fool you.

****** I helped beta that fic, it's dark, complicated and unique in all that I've read. I have great respect for the author. Definitely gets more and more in depth, and better as you read more.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

  Harry is still angry but this year he has a person to blame. A secret trunk, a kitten with a secret and an secret potion. I've been told this isn't complete. It is a complete year at Hogwarts as are the books so I considered it Complete.

** Amythyst linkao3(11047995) the series is sitting at 580k, currently up to 5th year, and still (slowly) updating.

But Jax the snake is a main character in his own right. He and Harry consider each other their only family.

  Curiosity killed the cat, satisfaction brought it back. Harry's curiosity leads him to exploring the Chamber a bit more thoroughly before he leaves for the Summer. What he finds there gives him a new responsibility beyond just himself and a lifelong satisfaction in the choices he makes from there on.
