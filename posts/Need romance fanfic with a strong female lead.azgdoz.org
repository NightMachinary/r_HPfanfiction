** /Hella Potter and the Reincarnated OC/ (linkffn(13175310)) is my current guilty pleasure fic. Hella (fem!Harry) got a pretty decent confidence boost from the titular OC. It's one of my favorite fem!Harry stories.

Mind you, the story's a commissioned one; the writer will keep writing it as long as the patron keeps paying. But since the Cambrian's is getting paid, he's also got an incentive to make it good. Cambrian's a prolific writer too, though he primarily writes hardcore smut. /Hella Potter/ is unusually tame and wholesome relative to the rest of his hyper-indulgant works.

If you want something quick, steamy, and well-written, I suggest giving it a try.

Further, rather than selling a product, Cambrian was selling his services as a writer, and freely distributes his creation afterward. I'm no copyright lawyer, nor am I read up on copyright law, but you could probably argue something like that if it ever came up in court.

It probably wouldn't, though. Conventions and the like would have a much harder time if every piece of commissioned fan art was struck down legally.

** WTF is intellectual property???????
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: wtf-is-intellectual-property
   :END:
Copyright is a subset of intellectual property, which also covers patent, trademark, and trade secret. Popular discussion often fails to distinguish between these largely distinct areas, which often leads to confusion. In brief:

- Copyright exists to protect creative, nonfunctional works.
- Patent exists to protect functional works.
- Trademark exists to identify the source of goods and services.
- Trade secret exists to prevent misappropriation of economically valuable information.

You are probably familiar with [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmwM_AKeMCk][A Very Potter Musical]]. (If not, you are very fortunate because you just found out about probably the best Harry Potter fanwork.) You may notice that, after the Starkid logo, we get this message:

#+begin_quote
  This Fan Musical is produced and performed solely for the personal, non-commercial enjoyment of ourselves and other Harry Potter fans.

  It is in no way sponsored, approved, endorsed by or affiliated with J. K. Rowling or Warner Bros. or any of their affiliates.
#+end_quote

Spoiler for when we get to the copyright section: in general, giving credit to an original author has zero (0) bearing on whether something's copyright infringement. So, why the disclaimer? Is Team Starkid stupid?

No; Team Starkid is not stupid. As some background, the musical was originally titled "Harry Potter: the Musical". This runs into trademark, not copyright, issues: it's unclear whether the source of the musical is J. K. Rowling or Warner Brothers. This is not okay for the same reason it's not okay for me to sell Apple computers: I'm piggybacking off the reputation and goodwill that someone else has built up. In this case, give an obvious parody a name befitting a parody and add the above disclaimer, thereby making it 100% clear that the source of the musical is neither J. K. Rowling nor Warner Brothers, and presto, your trademark issue is gone.

Conversely, authors who include similar disclaimers when the publish to ffn are /including needless words/. There was never a trademark issue to begin with because there is no confusion to readers about whether the source of a work published to fanfiction.net is J. K. Rowling.

** WTF is copyright????????
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: wtf-is-copyright
   :END:
Copyright consists of a number of exclusive rights given to the author of a creative work. We say the rights are exclusive because only the author has these rights. As you might expect, one of these exclusive rights is the right to make copies (hence "copyright"); when J. K. Rowling wrote Harry Potter, she was the only one who had the right to make copies of it. Importantly for our purposes, one of the exclusive rights given to the author of a creative work is the right to make derivative works. (Read: "I was making a derivative work" would be the /opposite/ of a defense.) Examples of derivative works include the Harry Potter films, the Cursed Child play, and fanfiction.

So, Harry Potter fanfiction is a derivative work of Harry Potter, only J. K. Rowling has the right to make derivative works of Harry Potter, therefore Harry Potter fanfiction infringes on J. K. Rowling's exclusive rights. Case closed, right?

As usual, things are not so cut and dry.

*** Did J. K. Rowling license Harry Potter fanfiction????????
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: did-j.-k.-rowling-license-harry-potter-fanfiction
    :END:
You might have noticed that J. K. Rowling did not make the Harry Potter films. Did Warner Brothers infringe on J. K. Rowling's exclusive rights to make Harry Potter films?

No; Warner Brothers did not infringe on J. K. Rowling's exclusive rights to make Harry Potter films. Copyright holders may free sell their exclusive rights, which is called licensing. Warner Brothers gave J. K. Rowling a boatload of money in exchange for exclusive rights to make Harry Potter films.

Interesting tidbit: authors are allowed to license exclusively /or/ non-exclusively. In the former case, the author transfers their exclusive right(s), so that only the licensee. Without doing research, my guess is that this is how J. K. Rowling licensed her exclusive rights to make Harry Potter films to Warner Brothers; notice how no one else has made Harry Potter films. However, in the latter case, authors can exchange permission to make derivative works for money /without/ giving away their right to make additional similar licensing agreements. For instance, my understanding is +that quite a number of game studios have made Lord of the Rings video games, presumably because Christopher Tolkien nonexclusively licensed the right to make video games to said game studios+wrong, see comment from [[/u/Evan_Th]] below, but the larger point stands. Importantly, exclusive licenses require written contracts, whereas nonexclusive licenses /don't/.

So, even though J. K. Rowling has exclusive rights to make derivative works, fanfiction authors are in the clear if J. K. Rowling has issued a license for such derivative works. Has she? As usual, the answer is [[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3753001.stm][maybe kinda]]:

#+begin_quote
  The spokesman for the Christopher Little literary agency said: "JK Rowling's reaction is that she is very flattered by the fact there is such great interest in her Harry Potter series and that people take the time to write their own stories.

  "Her concern would be to make sure that it remains a non-commercial activity to ensure fans are not exploited and it is not being published in the strict sense of traditional print publishing."

  He said writers had to ensure that the stories were not obscene and were credited to the author and not to JK Rowling.
#+end_quote

This means a broad swathe of Harry Potter fanfiction (read: derivative works) are, in fact, licensed by J. K. Rowling and therefore in the clear. Commissions /probably/ fall afoul of the "non-commercial" bit, but it's not like "non-commercial" is terribly well-defined---incidentally, a problem with Creative Commons licenses as well---and the model of "get paid per month Patreon and my users vote on what I write" is murkier still.

*** WTF is fair use???????????????
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: wtf-is-fair-use
    :END:
Fair use allows for use of copyright material under certain circumstances, regardless of license. Whether something is fair use is based on a context-sensitive four-factor test:

1. Purpose and character of the use.
2. Nature of the copyrighted work.
3. Amount used.
4. Effect on the market of the original work.

So, might fanfiction be protected under fair use? Well, the fourth factor weighs in favor (insofar as people aren't going to not buy Harry Potters books because they could read fanfic instead), second weighs against (Harry Potter is a very creative work with no functional aspects = highly protected by copyright), and the other two are ambiguous. Ultimately, nobody knows whether fanfiction would be found as fair use (my guess is no, but I wouldn't be surprised if I were wrong) because nobody has made that defense because the issue has never gone to court, which brings us to the next section.

*** Does any of this actually matter????????????
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: does-any-of-this-actually-matter
    :END:
No, none of this actually matters.

(Finally, a refreshingly clear answer!)

It is vanishingly unlikely that J. K. Rowling sues you for copyright infringement. Any damages she might recover are negligible (especially compared to her existing wealth) and she'd piss off quite a few of her fans quite a bit. Even authors who actively dislike fanfiction (Orson Scott Card comes to mind) still haven't sued anyone, presumably for similar reasons. Without checking my facts, I think that nitwit who wrote 50 Shades of Grey might posture aggressively at fan works (yes, 50 Shades started as a fanwork. Yes, the hypocrisy is mind-boggling), but this has never ended in court because, at the end of the day, everybody involved would much rather that not happen. Contrast this with, say, someone trying to make a bunch of money via unlicensed Harry Potter video games. This has tremendous effects on the market for legitimately-licensed video games (=lots of damages) and they have the money with which to pay those damages. Suing a game studio also won't come with the backlash that suing some fanfiction author would.

** Caveats
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: caveats
   :END:

1. My background here is "read a book on intellectual property". This topic is close enough to my interests that I'm fairly confident on what I wrote, especially the broad strokes of it, but there's probably some minor detail that's not quite right. Moreover, said book didn't cover fanfiction; there might be some esoteric fanfiction exceptions that I'm unaware of.
2. More importantly, the above is very US-centric. There's various treaties that more-or-less put most nations more-or-less on the same page, but I'm not nearly as certain about international IP law as I am US IP law. In particular, it's my understanding that fair use in the US is broader than it is elsewhere.
3. I have suppressed all manner of detail for the sake of conciseness and relevance. For instance, works don't qualify for copyright until they're fixed in a tangible medium that lets you get it back out, such that people who went to midnight releases of book 7 and shouted spoilers over a megaphone weren't making unauthorized copies, but recording themselves doing that /was/.

***** Great explanation!

To nitpick one minor point: The Lord of the Rings movies and video games and just about all tie-in merchandise are legal because J. R. R. Tolkien himself exclusively licensed a whole lot of rights back in 1968. He did it reluctantly because he needed the money (it was before the books became popular), and both he and his son Christopher Tolkien regretted it. Christopher himself refused any subsequent licensing, and when Peter Jackson finally bought and took advantage of the movie licensing, he sharply criticized the movies as missing the books' themes.

However, Christopher finally went to his well-deserved retirement last year and passed on Estate management to his nephews. Unfortunately from my perspective and a number of fans' (who agree with Christopher's verdict on the films), they've quietly licensed some more film rights to Amazon. It's not clear how much, and I'm hoping they do it better than Jackson did, but I'm not optimistic.

Oh well. At least it can't be worse than a lot of fanfic.

  Most people tend to assume they'll wake up exactly where they fall asleep, and usually they have good reason to do so. For someone, however, even that simple certainty stops being a given one strange night, when quite surprisingly he does in fact not wake up where he fell asleep. And that is only the beginning of what will be one most unusual week in the life of Harry Potter.

*** That first one isn't that good, which was disappointing.

I thought at first that it was a decently-written fic with good intelligent protagonists, but then intelligent!Hermione turned out to be a Mary Sue (or so close that she's indistinguishable from one), whose central motivation is that "the wizarding world needs to be dragged out of its old prejudices, kicking and screaming if necessary", according to the author's summary. That would be fine, if pretty high-handed to think that way about other cultures, but the story's pacing to achieving such a goal for the wizarding world is... not very good. After ~400k words, only 2-3 months have passed in-story, due to many random subplots and dozens of OC's that expand the worldbuilding but add little to the story.

I also found it disturbing that Hermione is mentally a 25 year old dropped into the body of her 15 year old self, but still has sex with 15 year old Tom Riddle, because apparently his intelligence makes him mature enough for this to be okay. If it was a 25 year old time traveler Harry and a 15 year old girl, the weird vibes would be way more obvious.

**** Well, I don't take it personally that your opinion is different when it comes to fiction. That's why there is so much variety out there.

Hermione in canon is always verging on a Mary Sue. Doesn't seem so out of character that she's even more so like that when she's older.

I don't mind long--I read quickly and fanfic is free entertainment. As long as it's not horribly written or offensive, I can persist even if I want the plot to move along. I just skim if things get boring.

You have a point about the age gap, but it's Tom Riddle, rising Dark Lord--a girl his age would get eaten up. And Hermione thinks of him as an opponent, not a child.

*** I liked that one overall, enough to save it. This Hermione seemed a bit soft in her personality--ordinarily she seems quite hyperfocused when it comes to goals, but I can see that when it comes to romance she's got a weak spot. In canon she forgave Ron way too many times for it to be sensible. Regulus grows up pretty quickly in the story, so he's faster than Ron was.

** I like /Denial/ by little beloved (ffnlink(8967842)). It's Hermione x Snape, and a marriage law fic, but 5+ years after school, and they aren't paired by the law. There's actually romantic development between the two.

Hermione also /does/ spend a bit of time /not/ strong, but she's crying over a boy, which is bound to happen in a romance. She also comes out of the far end better for it, and it really does make sense in context.

It's also held up for multiple rereadings over several years, and is one of my favorite fics!

Edit: there is also smut, but the majority of the story is well-crafted plot. It also has two of my favorite OCs, an eccentric uncle named Lance, and a devoted yet ballsy houself names Moe.
