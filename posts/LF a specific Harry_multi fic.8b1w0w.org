Starts off with Harry taking Lavender to the Yule Ball instead of Parvati. All the characters are aged up, it's basically Harry having his way with almost all the typical fanfic women. Still being updated far as I know. Can't for the life of me remember the name.

  The stress from the Triwizard Tournament was building up. Harry just hoped that the Yule Ball and his date with Lavender Brown might alleviate some of it. Lemons. Harry/Multi. Hermione, Cho, Fleur, Lavender, Susan, Hannah and possibly more.
