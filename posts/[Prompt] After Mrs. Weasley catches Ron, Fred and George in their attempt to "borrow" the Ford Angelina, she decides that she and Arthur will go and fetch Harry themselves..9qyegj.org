*Requirements*

- I'm not fussy about length--as long as is necessary
- Molly looking like a saber-toothed tiger when she catches her sons
- Arthur being fascinated by various Muggle items
- The Weasleys encountering Vernon and Petunia

*Edit*

Given my inability to edit the title, I should point out that it's Ford Anglia, not Angelina.


** Sorry for nitpicking, but Ford Anglia.
