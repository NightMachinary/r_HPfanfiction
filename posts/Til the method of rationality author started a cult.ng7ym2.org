** So, Eliezer Yudkowsky is the 'leader' of LessWrong.\\
Yudkowsky calls himself an 'autodidact'. This word means 'self-taught'. Now, Yud (as I'll refer to him for short, for convenience rather than meaning anything derogatory) is certainly a little smarter than your average bear. He's pretty good at writing long essays, after all.\\
And I should point out that some of the articles on LessWrong (Yud is not the only contributor) are interesting, valuable or positive.

He is, however, very misguided on certain topics, especially those regarding his favoured topics like Bayes Theorem and probability, computer science, and AI.

Yud's main issue in terms of his 'personal philosophy' is a slavish adherence to the idea of 'Bayesianism' and his view of 'rationality', even when it does not actually make sense. Yud rejects the idea of anything having absolutely 0% or absolutely 100% probablity, which leads to some very odd opinions and conclusions. In one of Yud's own essays, he points out that if you're mugged and asked for $50 or the mugger will detonate a nuclear bomb in the city (but he doesn't have a gun pointed at you), then you should give the mugger the money - after all, there's a nonzero chance of the city blowing up!

As for the cult-like ideas - Yud is the head of MIRI, the 'Machine Intelligence Research Institution'.\\
The ideas of this institution go basically like this:

- One day there's going to be a really powerful AI that can do almost anything.\\
- We should do everything possible to make sure that AI is friendly to humans instead of unfriendly.\\
- You should donate money to us to help our cause.\\
- If the AI is super-powerful, then the best thing in the world would be to help it come into existence faster, and the worst thing (from the AI's perspective) is to prevent that. The AI will be powerful enough to know who donated and who didn't.\\
- Since the AI is guaranteed to exist eventually, then you should donate lots of money to us so that the AI will know you were good.\\
- If you didn't donate or help, the AI will know that. So it will retroactively motivate you by simulating a virtual version of you, and then torturing it. In fact, it could simulate torturing billions of you!
- In fact, you might be a simulation right now and have no way of knowing! In fact, the odds are, you /are/ the simulation (check out that probability again!). You could be tortured right now, or seconds from now! Donate now to save yourself!\\

As critics have attempted to point out, this is basically just reinventing religion and is a cult.

Lastly, /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/ is poor fanfiction that is not particularly faithful to the characters, not actually faithful to actual rational science despite Rational-Harry claiming it's what he believes, and also against some of the most obvious themes of the novels. Anyone who's read the actual novels can tell you that Dementors are a metaphor for depression, and that Voldemort's big issue is that he believes that nothing is worse than death, and so he tortures his own soul and ruins lives to escape it. And his literal name, Voldemort, is 'flight of/from death'.\\
Yud himself, unfortunately, is absolutely terrified of death himself. This means that /he/ thinks Dementors are a metaphor for death, and thinks Voldemort is totally right but is just doing things the wrong way.\\
The words are in roughly the right order and are spelled correctly, that's the most you can say for it. It's just nerd-wank.

*** The AI thing is a particularly funny one, I think - the one I remember from him is the 'Roko's Basilisk' one, which apparently gave him (and a bunch of other people in his forums) nightmares.

Looks like it mutated into the MRI one, but it's just so funny to me that his version of logic/rationality is that you should be living terrified of a hypothetical future AI punishing you in a simulation for not bringing it around.

For the fic itself, I know there was a chapter by chapter critique of it that I found here: [[https://danluu.com/su3su2u1/hpmor/]] that was interesting (on top of the more obvious failings/problems in it). The fic itself can be enjoyable, depending on the person's taste - but it moved too far away from the premise I was personally interested in, and I thought the 'rationality' espoused by it was not particularly rational.

**** To be fair, while Yudkowsky's initial reaction suggested that he was actually worried by the idea of Roko's Basilisk:

  Listen to me very closely, you idiot.\\
  YOU DO NOT THINK IN SUFFICIENT DETAIL ABOUT SUPERINTELLIGENCES CONSIDERING WHETHER OR NOT TO BLACKMAIL YOU. THAT IS THE ONLY POSSIBLE THING WHICH GIVES THEM A MOTIVE TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON THE BLACKMAIL.\\
  There's an obvious equilibrium to this problem where you engage in all positive acausal trades and ignore all attempts at acausal blackmail. Until we have a better worked-out version of TDT and we can prove that formally, it should just be OBVIOUS that you DO NOT THINK ABOUT DISTANT BLACKMAILERS in SUFFICIENT DETAIL that they have a motive to ACTUALLY BLACKMAIL YOU.

He was since stated that he does NOT believe you should be living in fear of it:

#+begin_quote
  ...a Friendly AI torturing people who didn't help it exist has probability ~0, nor did I ever say otherwise. If that were a thing I expected to happen given some particular design, which it never was, then I would just build a different AI instead---what kind of monster or idiot do people take me for? Furthermore, the Newcomblike decision theories that are one of my major innovations say that rational agents ignore blackmail threats (and meta-blackmail threats and so on).

*** I'll agree that Yudkowsky is conceited and that the lesswrong movement can be somewhat cult-like, but as someone who used to read a lot of his essays I believe a lot of this copy and paste misrepresents his positions.

A google search turn up the [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Ap4KfkHyxjYPDiqh2/pascal-s-muggle-infinitesimal-priors-and-strong-evidence][article]] for the claim about the hypothetical scenario with the mugger. Yudskowsky does not argue that you should give the mugger the money, but rather goes through some rather convoluted and long-winded thoughts on preventing being led to such an absurd conclusion by just doing the math.

The summary of the ideas of the institute conflates their actual goals of making sure that powerful AI is friendly with the hypothetical evil AI called Roko's Basiisk. The lesswrong community came up with and worried over the idea of this hypothetical future AI that will torture anybody who does not help create it, and the idea of this AI motivating people to actually help create it for real to avoid being tortured. And yes, there is some weird stuff in there about it torturing simulated versions of you. So they don't want to create such an AI themselves, but some are afraid others will do so.

Joking aside i believe in death by author. As soon as the Author is finished writing, it is up to us to interpret it however we want. Its why i don't particularly care about J.K. popping back up with useless information like the hufflepuffs have massive circle jerks or that wizards used to drop trough anywhere then vanish the remains.

Fanfic is just someones take on a book. I don't care if they interpret the book different. Now Personally i didn't care for hpmor but if someone likes it, i could give two flying Fs. I will say if you think the author is a piece of trash dont buy stuff from them and pirate it. A book can be great and the author can be a terrible human, Its not mutually exclusive.

This is not really what "death of the author" means. Death of the author is about interpretation - the freedom to form different opinions of a work. For example: is Snape a good man? JKR says yes. But that is a moral judgement and someone with a different moral code may think differently. "Death of the author" means that you can't say "JKR intended Snape to be good" as a conclusive argument. Because the author's intent is irrelevant to what judgement is justified by the work, and the work may justify different judgements depending on the reader's perspective.

However, death of the author does *not* entail that the work itself is whatever you want it to be. Snape told Voldemort about the prophecy. That is a fact of the story, not a matter of interpretation. If the reader disagrees, they are simply wrong.

An author adding to their story is not covered by death of the author, because the author is not attempting to dictate an interpretation of their story. Rather, they are creating more, new story - new facts.

I don't really see how anyone can really say an author cannot do this. After all, Chamber of Secrets was JKR adding more story to the published work that was Philosopher's Stone. And so on after that. If "authors cannot add to their story after it is published" is a rule, then the only canon is Philosopher's Stone, and there is no such thing as a sequel.

***** I think there's two points in there:

*Argument from contradiction*

This is the idea that an author can only add to their work in circumstances where there is no possibility for contradiction of previous material.

I think there are a few problems with this argument:

1. There are many examples of authors adding to a story in a contradictory way e.g. the different continuities of Marvel comics, the different continuities of Star Wars, the different timelines of Star Trek.

2. Additionally, formal publication is no protection against accidental contradiction; see the Trace as against Petunia's statement about Lily coming back from Hogwarts and using magic in the holidays.

3. If the presence of contradiction does render something non-canon, then again, many of the later HP books must be excluded from the HP canon.

In short, the rule appears to be too strict and fails to accurately describe common practice.

*Argument from formality*

This is the idea that an author can only add to their work if they publish that addition through a particular medium (namely, a novel).

This just feels rather anachronistic and gives arbitrary priority to traditional print publishing over other forms of media.

As against these arguments, I would put forward a further point:

*Argument from the possibility of sequels*

If you concede that JKR could write an 8th Harry Potter book and that this book would be canon, then it seems that you concede the point that JKR has the right to add to the work, and that addition could contain whatever she wants.

Once you have made that concession, there doesn't really seem to be much scope for any principled objection to JKR adding to the story through other modes of publishing, including web publishing or non-written media. Because you've admitted that JKR has the power to stipulate new story content, all your objection is left with is some idea that new story content has to be on paper and bound with a spine.

****** I agree with you that the term "death of the author" refers to interpretation of the work, rather than factual additions to the series, like you wrote above. What the term means isn't up for interpretation!

However, regarding people ignoring parts of the author's additions to their stories, I don't think that your "Argument from the possibility of sequels" works, given that people do routinely discount the Cursed Child.

Some things are not explicitly stated and they always fall onto the interpretation of the reader. To use your example, some fics portray Snape as a deranged man with an unhealthy obsession for Lily, some fics portray him as a noble man who spent his entire life atoning for his mistake. JK never said or gave any indication that he was one way or another in the story. So that aspect can be whatever the reader wants it to be.
