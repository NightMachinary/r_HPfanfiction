Everything that is made is made using magic and imbued with magic. When you want to defend a house you don't just use wards. You use statues that can be animated, plants, potions, runes that can create fire arrows of death, etc. Worried about anti-apparation and portray wards, dig a tunnel or hidden safe rooms undetectable by magic. Every chore has a spell. Basically looking for fics where wizards and witches use magic and their brains to their full potential.

"Wait, Harry. I seriously need to crap," said Ginny.

In complete shock, Harry saw how Ginny used 'Accio' to summon the literal shit out of her only to vanish it afterwards.

His girlfriend gave him the most normal of smiles afterwards, as if she had just washed her hands in front of him.

"Sorry about that, you were saying...?"

*** Too complex.. what about the wizards who can't perform a summoning or (worse) vanishing ? I posit the existence of shit-vanishing underclothes.
