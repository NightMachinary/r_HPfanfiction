currently rewatching House of Cards and this got me the inspiration and Question if there are similar Fics in the HP universe, of course from the View of Harry and/or Ginny. Both can be married, but their marriage is more for Publicity or Business, so they actually have an open marriage and sleep with other People for Power or influence, or other things but not as drasticall as murder or "damaging" others (what kind of damage is subjective, so im open for anything). Im fine if Harry is "married" with any other Woman if not (or besides) with Ginny.


** I have yet to find a single Postwar H/G fic that depicts them as competent and ruthless politicians, which I think was most likely true considering they climbed to the top of that cesspool known as the British Ministry of Magic at such young age.

** Man, I'd love a Frank Underwood-esque Harry Potter. That would be great.
