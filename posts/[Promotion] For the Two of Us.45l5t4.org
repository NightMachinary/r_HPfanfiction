A little one-shot I re-read and wanted to share. It's sweet and a tiny bit sad from the POV of a young Mcgonagall.

  My name is Minerva, from the roman goddess. When I was born, I was expected to live up to the name. And I tried, I truly did. Athena was my sister, and when she died, I did not mope around and grieve, no, I lived my life. I lived it for the both of us.
