I'm planning on writing a Harry Potter/fate crossover where all the summoned servants in fate are Harry Potter characters. While I have got all the other classes in fate, I'm yet to find any character from Harry Potter that can qualify as a Lancer class servant in fate. For those who do not know, the class definitions in fate are really lax (like most of the archers in fate using swords instead of bows) so a lancer class servant would only need to have used some Lance like object to qualify. Is there any character in Harry Potter that can qualify as a lancer?


** The only one I can think of would be Sir Cadogan the knight from the portrait in PoA... not sure how you could incorporate him though!

** Firenze as the rest of the Centaurs held an spear I Guess, other than than I once created a versi√≥n of post-war Harry as a Lancer based not on the weapon itself, but on its combat skills akin to the Lancer class, more than the Caster class.

** An idea for you, as I'm planning something similar except I'm going to have it be that 9 HP characters become demi servants/psuedo servants, but why not use Parvarti and just have her be the body for Parvarti?

** If you want to make a literary joke: Ron prehaps, mainly due to the fact that he fills the role of Lancer (When Refering to the literary device.) Although Neville could act as such, as be takes up the role of Lancer to Harry during year 7, along with using a large pointy object to Flay nagini.

If going just by character traits, I would suggest luna, I would see her as a lighter unit, flitting around the field, focusing on a more support role, likely using a quarterstaff or Naginata, focusing dodging and deflecting over blocking, not meant for fighting heavy units, but more for whittling down lighter units, or distracting a heavy hitter.

** Well if you look into fanfiction, Harry has often used long pointy objects to stab his harem of girls ;)

In the books, well no character that has used Spears and lances come to mind and this speaks badly about any character that can qualify as a lancer since iirc the fame of a heroic spirit is an very important factor. I'm not the most knowledgeable about the fate universe but I'm fairly certain there are more classes than the standard seven (eg: Avenger, Ruler, etc...) So if you can't find a suitable character to be a lancer you can replace the lancer class with one of the rarer classes.
