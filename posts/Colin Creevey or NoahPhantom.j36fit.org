I've just finished Vekin87's Albus Potter series and although I found the first 2 books to be a tad amateur, the series evolved into a great series. I was just wondering what your opinions were of Colin Creevey and NoahPhantom? I find Albus the most interesting of the three Potter children and really fancy giving another author a go but I cannot decide between the two. I've heard NoahPhantom's series deteriorates over time but I can't seem to find anything about the quality of Creevey's work.

Any opinions are appreciated, thanks guys.


** I've read NoahPhantom's works a few times- I have now reached the age where I can't seem to read them anymore. There is a lot more world building than in Vekin87 but this ultimately means a lot more exposition which gets a bit boring to read over time. I can't comment on Colin Creevey, but I would recommend giving NoahPhantom's a read. I would say the plot doesn't really ramp up until the later books but it also becomes much more AU then as well (compliant with the series but has very different themes). I enjoy the originality and world building though and the ideas have definitely informed some of my own ideas on magic.

Edit: removed what I think might have been a bit of a spoiler?

*** Thank you for taking the time to reply. I started NoahPhamtom's series a few hours ago and so far, I'm impressed with it (although James is a bit of an ass)

Just a quick question, what does AU mean?

**** AU means alternate universe, so not canon compliant. This can range from minor changes to the magic or schooling system to huge ones like the universe not having magic or Voldemort winning the first war.

** You're right that NoahPhantom's series doesn't build up in quality the same way Vekin's does. It's very different than Vekin's series; it's way crazier and over-the-top, more colorful, and probably better with worldbuilding, the plotting is really detailed and exceptional, but the characters somewhat take a hit. There's a plot point in book 7 that I thought was absolutely terrible. I didn't think the ending was very good, but the epilogue is. I have a lot of mixed feelings about this series, but it's definitely very high quality, at least by fanfic standards.

Colin Creevey's series was, at least to me, a little lower quality in terms of writing. It's not very fast-paced, doesn't reach that much beyond canon, and is largely character driven. Someone brought it up the other day on here and I'll probably give it another go to try to finish it. But I did find NoahPhantom's series a metaphorical page-turner, which doesn't really apply to this one.

Some other things to try might be Slide's Stygian Trilogy, which has Albus as one of the main characters and to me is better than both Vekin and Noah, or Lippert's James Potter series, which I avoided for a while but enjoyed when I read it.

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.

**** Thanks for that detailed reply, I really appreciate it. Lippert's James Potter series was actually the first fanfic I ever read and while I enjoyed it, I found it to be a tad corny, overly political and I couldn't stand Petra as a character. I also didn't like how he made Harry out to be dull and boring.

I then moved on to Albus Severus fanfics as I find him to have the most potential. Sharing the names of two of the most interesting characters opens up so many possibilities namely interactions with certain portraits in the Headmaster's office!

Anyway, I'm blabbing. I started NoahPhantom's series a few hours ago and already I'm impressed with his prose so hopefully it'll keep me busy for a while.

Oh and I've heard of the Stygian trilogy and I've heard it's very good so I will definitely give that a shot too

***** It's funny, you had the same gripes as me with Lippert. He had a couple of incredible ideas, like a conservative Harry and James's obsession with Petra, but never really fleshed out either the political system or Petra's character well enough for them to work. Also agree about the corniness, the whole Christmas scene in book five was completely unnecessary as well.

But yeah, you don't get any of that in NoahPhantom. There are flaws, but they're very different flaws.
