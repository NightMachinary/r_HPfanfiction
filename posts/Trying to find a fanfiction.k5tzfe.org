** Not sure if you are aware, but characters reading the books is a whole trope/sub-genre, so if that is all you remember I doubt anybody can point you towards the specific fic you read.

I have avoided the trope, so could not even point you towards some of the better ones, but you could check out these threads, maybe you get lucky:
