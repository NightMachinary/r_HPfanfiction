I'm working on my own rewrite of the series with a bunch of OC's. As far as actually writing them I'm currently working on Chamber of Secrets but I have been working out the plot in my head and I want to write a simple plot outline for the series. I would like to do cursed child after I have finished the series and want to have the plot worked out before I come to write Goblet of Fire for obvious reasons. I'm having trouble working out the time travel scenes -- what happens and how they can eventually put it right without changing the plot but I'm having a bit of trouble with this.

Here's what I have:

OC is Hogwarts champion alongside Harry instead of Cedric. The basic premise is still going back in time to save Cedric, but in my version he dies during the battle of Hogwarts serving Voldemort under the Imperius curse (much like Stan Shunpike's situation...I always thought being a death eater was so out of character for Cedric). OC is the one to kill Cedric in the battle of Hogwarts; he survives the triwizard tournament, unlike Cedric he does not accompany Harry to the graveyard.

Albus, Scorpious and Delphi's idea is to destroy the triwizard cup to stop Harry from being sent to the graveyard thus stopping Voldemort's return altogether and saving not only Cedric but everyone else who died, then replace the cup with a duplicate. Delphi then intends turn the new cup into a portkey when Albus and Scorpious have walked away, then have OC touch the cup as well as Harry thus having him killed so Cedric survives to kill Neville.

The issue I am having is that I intended OC to be under the Imperius Curse by Barty Crouch Jr (to force him to ensure Harry wins) and he is instructed not to touch the cup. The obvious answer to Delphi would be to simply kill Barty Crouch, but that would change the plot of Goblet of Fire and Albus and Scorpius wouldn't be able to put it right later. Another option I considered was having Delphi convince Crouch to lift the curse (they are on the same side after all), but I intended to have OC still under the curse after Harry's return in order to convince him to go back to the castle so he could kill him. Not only that, but it would make more sense to Crouch to keep him under the curse and order him to touch the cup himself...but I have no way of having Scorpius and Albus change this when they go back again.

Does anyone have any ideas on how to solve this?


** 1) I am pretty surprised someone may want to use the plot of Cursed Child (I have a deep hatred for it).

2) Considering your scenario, I you want the OC to touch the Cup without the curse being lifted, just create an event where he touch the cup without planning to do it :

- For example, while Scorpius and Albus leach to hide, Delphi may stay near the Cup "to make sure there is no problem", using the Invisibility Cloack if possible or just under a Desilusion charm. When the victims are near the cup, a Depulso charm in the back of OC, pushed toward Harry, who fall on the cup. Oc is touching Harry when he touchs the portkey, so he should be taked along.

*** I actually liked cursed child, my issue with it was Cedric being a death eater, which is why I fixed it by having him under the imperius curse instead.

I like your idea of forcing him some other way, I didn't think about him being transported if he were touching Harry *facepalm*

** Delphi may have discovered a way to break the Imperius that wasn't known during the war but was discovered later. I favor the use of the Cruciatus in some specific form, but your muse may vary.

*** Crouch can fight the imperius curse, I was thinking of having her convince him to go along with her plan...the issue was coming up with a way for scorpius to stop this when he goes back in time to fix it.

**** He doesn't need to be persuaded. He's very intelligent. All she has to do is do or say something to let him know that* someone* is going for the cup and he'll improvise. He beat Moody, a powerful veteran Auror, confunded the Goblet and performed multiple wordless human transfigurations, all after more than a decade of being restricted from casting. He won't have any issues stopping a couple of kids.

I'm slightly confused as to why Delphi would want the curse lifted, if getting Harry to the graveyard to resurrect Voldemort is what she too wants? And remember, they go back several times already. Scorpius doesn't need to stop it precisely then, he can possibly counteract it on a different trip.
