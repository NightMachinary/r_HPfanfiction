I can't remember where I read it, and it might just have been the Weasley twins trying to screw with the new kid (Harry), but I'm pretty sure I remember a reference to Quidditch players disappearing and then "turn up in a month or two!". This can be in 1st year, as an act of sabotage by Quirrell, 2nd, as another desperate attempt by Dobby to "help" or perhaps in lew of the the cursed Bludger. I'm thinking it could start as a desert/wilderness survival story, and then he'd stumble on one of Bill's excavations and it could turn either into a nice Mentor fic or a powerwank, I'm not picky. Either way, he'd eventually make it back to Hogwarts, deeply tanned and with a few useful curses and countercurses under his belt.

  Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.

I always read this as a joke about referees being getting cursed.

*** As did I, but it opens up possibilities. We could say that Harry was trying to save Hootch from it?
