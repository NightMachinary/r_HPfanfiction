- Snape changes the class schedules so that Griffyndors are with Hufflepuffs and Slytherins with Ravenclaws... and as a result Slytherin and Ravenclaw first years team up to create new and innovative potions with no knowledge about how they should go about it, resulting in /more/ explosions and some crimes against nature while the Gryffindor/Hufflepuff class gets so bored and unaware of their surroundings that they plainly forget to finish their potions half the time.

-Then he decides to try again but inverting it, Gryffindors egg the Ravenclaws in their experiments to go beyond sanity and logic while Slytherin wastes all the class annoying Hufflepuffs and all their ingredients sabotaging their potions.

-McGonnagal finally concretizes her dream of ending divination... but it turns out that divination is actually an integral (though not widely divulged) part of the job for aurors, healers, enchanters...

-Flitwick removes Binns as history teacher for someone who teaches more than Goblin rebellions... but it turns out that Binn's class was a point of pride for ghosts all over the world that now start haunting Hogwarts and an important part of an already forgotten treatise with the Goblin Nation which sparks another rebellion.

-Hagrid decides to expand the pre-authorized pet list while no one is looking... enough said.

-Anyone decides to mount an extermination of the Acromantula population on the Forbidden forest, with their natural predators gone an even more dangerous colony of magical creatures move right in (alternatively when Harry kills the Basilisk the Acromantulla population starts attacking the castle).

-Someone finally fires Flich, five minutes later a duel starts in the middle of the hallway and promptly escalates into a full-blown civil war all around the castle with random popular students declaring themselves king/queen and battling to conquer first Hogwarts and then Britain.

Flitwick set the wards back to their max-security settings, accidentally making them forcibly keep away all external communication, animals dead or alive (including livestock for food-supply and magical beasts) making everyone have to get his authorization to cast any spell least they be banished to the heart of the Forbidden Forest /and/ sending himself into a comma caused by expanding the information gathered by the wards to the max capacity and then redirecting the influx from Dumbledore's silver instruments directly into his brain.

-Madam Hooch send for new brooms for flying class, unfortunately not only are the new brooms more expensive, but they are also much more fragile and need to be replaced frequently after 11 YO crash them by accident while mounting one for the first time in their lives while trying to impress their classmates.

-Professors form an united front to keep external factors (like the PS or dementor's or tournaments...) from interfering in Hogwarts, only to then discover that the bulk of the school's funding comes from political articulations and fees for Hogwarts service as a bank for things Gringotts either is unwilling to store or isn't trusted enough to store, and that they together don't have an ounce of Dumbledore's political acumen, contacts or the political capital to bend any situation in Hogwart's favor.

-They then decide to replace DADA as a class to outwit the curse, instead the curse now affects every class.

*** More that Flich is the only authority figure with the sheer unoccupied time to keep watch over the halls in frequent bases, it doesn't matter if the students could take him on a fight, he can tell on them to the teachers, and with his knowledge of the secret passages plus Mrs. Nora working around the clock to track places with too many students he can break the inevitable duels that pop up every now and then before things get too bad. Without him though, student A starts a duel and it both drags on long enough and escalated high enough that the friends of both students get there and feel the need to interfere whether they agree with their friends or not, this ends accumulating and eventually someone will (probably by accident) do or say something particularly beyond the pale, and considering that the students around are hormonal teenagers pumped up on adrenaline in a high-stress combat situation this results in them also going past the limits, at this point even if a professor comes up to try breaking the fight the students are more likely to just attack them too (mob mentality is such a warm and fuzzy piece of human psychology üòÅ). As a result of it the side that manages to make the most damage will probably drive the other away and the group of children previously pumped up on adrenaline will then come down into a terror/shock hangover while still a bit drunk on victory and look to the most well-liked or skilled individual around for guidance, this student that is also a child will have two options, he and his friends can stand-down and take their rightful punishment or they can deny to have done anything wrong at all and dig their heels in to save themselves and their friends of being punished (a punishment that is already harsh but that their panicked minds will turn into some hellish landscape of torture), still riding the high of winning the battle (potentially against a teacher even) and of being named the leader by the students around there is little chance of this leader to heed reason or good sense in this situation and will instead decide to tactically take over part of the castle since their group already proved to themselves that they are battle-capable. Meanwhile the defeated group will grow resentful of their loss and fearful of being punished which will blown into panic at hearing that the other group is still baying for their blood passing through a similar process, both groups being potentially much more harshly affected if there were actual deaths involved, speeding up the process on both fronts, consider that this is something that will probably repeat over and over again and you end up with many factions distrusting one another and thus trying to conquer as much space as they can. Admittedly, this would be a reaaallll long-shot and chances are that the rebellions would be squashed down pretty fast by either the staff or the ministry that both have actively trained and tested fighters plus that either portrayals or ghosts would go call a teacher before it ever got that far, but it was the most far-reaching potential consequence of Flich's being fired that I could come up with.

#+end_quote

Divination is so underused in canon and fanfics. I love the idea of healers narrowing down treatment plans or aurors narrowing down a criminal's location.

In The 9th House by Leigh Bardugo (actual novel, not HP related), the book opens up with Yale students predicting the stock market by playing around with a dead man's entrails, something the ancient romans actually used to do. It's called anthropomancy. I would kill to see that go down in Knocturn Alley or have a badass Lavender do it for the war.

*** Oh, definitely! Lavander always seemed like such an underused character for me, you know, like, she was the girl to whom Hermione was rude a couple of times and that eventually became Ron's girlfriend, and then was mauled by Greyback, but she had basically no importance at all in the story from start to finish, no character growth and minimal personality overall which is such a shame, I mean, what was it like for her to have her favorite class be dismissed out of hand and vocally by Hermione? What was her relationship with Ron like for her and how did their breakup and eventually getting together with Hermione affect her? And how did she deal with being attacked by Greyback?

**** If you notice, every traditionally feminine character in the series is looked down upon. Sure Umbridge and Skeeter are pieces of shit, but there's also a lot of hate on Fleur and Lavender too. Granted, it's not just a Rowling issue, but it's still annoying.
