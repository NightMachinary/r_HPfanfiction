** Heh. I like it. Here's my take:

#+begin_quote
  Harry jogged through onto platform 9 and 3 quarters. It had taken him forever to finally feel around the column between platforms 9 and 10 to figure out there was an invisible barrier separating the normal side of the train station from the magical side, and the train seemed about to leave.

  As he lugged his trunk towards the train he saw a pair of redheads standing at the entrance to the train handing out twine necklaces to the last few stragglers boarding the train. One student, wearing green highlighted robes, just scowled at the grinning pair, muttering, "Warped Weasleys," under their breath.

  As Harry approached, the pair looked up at him with seemingly dazed expressions on their faces; they were twins. "Oh, look Fred, it's Harry Potter."

  "I think you're right, George. Hi, Harry Potter," said the other, "better board quick the train is leaving."

  "Er, hi," mumbled Harry. He struggled with his trunk for a minute before both of the twins lunged forward, causing him to flinch backwards.

  "Need some help there Harry?" they both exclaimed in unison, wrestling his trunk onto the train.

  Eyes wide, Harry's gaze darted back and forth between them.

  "Here you are now, come along, the train is leaving," said the one named George. To impress his point, the steam whistle on the train let out a long burble.

  "Thanks..." said Harry as he hopped into the train.

  The two had already finished stowing his trunk in a nearby storage compartment. "Don't forget your charm, you'll need it," said Fred, thrusting a necklace festooned with a bottle cork pendant into Harry's hands.

  "Nargles you know," agreed George, shouting over his shoulder as the two took off up the train.

  Harry could only stare at their retreating backs as he looked around.

  --------------

  Harry entered the train compartment with a single redheaded boy leaning way back and reading a book upside down. "Excuse me, do you mind if I ride in this compartment?"

  The boy glanced up, and Harry noticed he has a massive splotch of puke-green muck on the left side of his face. "Hello, Harry Potter. Not at all," he said, before returning to his paper.

  Harry just sat and stared for a moment, wondering his he was going mad. Shaking his head, he sat down resignedly across from the boy.

  "Name's Ron, Ron Weasley. Nice to meet you."

  "Hi... I'm... Harry..."

  "Have either of you seen a toad? Neville's lost his."

  Harry and Ron looked up to see a girl with a bushy brown mane of hair.

  "Are you reading Hogwarts: A History?" asked Hermione, her voice pitched up in excitement, and pointing at the book in Ron's hands.

  "No actually, this is Hogwarts: An Alternate History," he said, holding the book up so she could see the title.

  Hermione tilted he head to the side, reading the book's title upside down.

  "What is this?" she asked, her interest peaked.

  "This is the true account of the history of Hogwarts," replied Ron, his voice monotone and his eyes glassy and unfocused.

  "Hogwarts: A History, is the ministry approved historical text," said Hermione with a huff. "Can I see that?"

  "Of course," said Ron, delicately handing her the book.

  Hermione took it and intoned, "Hogwart's: An Alternate History by Muriel Weasley. There's an apostrophe in 'Hogwarts'!" she exclaimed.

  Ron nodded sagely.

  She turned open the cover, reading the publisher's summary. Hermione's eyes scanned rapidly back and forth her face reddening and jaws grinding. "Hogwart's was founded in 1968 by Bingham Hogwart?" she shouted, glaring at Ron.

  "I suspect time travel," he said.

  Hermione glared daggers at him as she passed the book back and turned to leave. Just before she left, she looked back at Ron and motioned towards her face. "Did you know-"

  "You've got a bit of dirt on your nose, right there," interrupted Ron, pointing to his own nose, and indeed, she did.

  Hermione's mouth snapped shut and her eyes burned with anger. With a strangled cry, she slammed the door. Her footsteps could be heard marching away up the train.

  Harry started at the closed door before looking at Ron who's eyes were now owlishly wide, looking rather sincere.

  "Lovely girl," he said, before returning to his book.

*** I hope Muriel's last name isn't Weasley because otherwise I think Molly and Arthur would be like second cousins. Although that might explain the entire Weasley family having Luna's character to be fair.

Anyway, I would definitely read an entire seven books of everyone is insane except Luna.

**** Luna is the best. Couldn't pass this prompt up. Such an amusing concept. I assumed that if Ron was Lovegoodish, the whole family would be. I'm in stitches thinking about Percy.

** And it's because of a botched fertility ritual when they were trying to conceive a girl. They got it right the next time. Blood magic is tricky.
