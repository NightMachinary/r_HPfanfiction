(Wasn't entirely sure whether to put the flair as self-p or discussion)

What the title basically says. The snip is from the pov of the oc from the fic itself (dream sequence of sorts).

Changes to the canon verse include both, another Peverell and a fourth Hollow.

...

-Rodrick furrowed his brows as he took in the strange pathway. When he turned to question the man himself, he found no one in sight.

"I suppose this is faster compared to simply reading it..." Rodrick remarked to no one in particular. He focused his eyes on the four figures slowly walking down the muddy pathway. At the back, his eyes widened when they spotted the man's face. Only he looked to be a /teen/, and clearly the youngest of the four.

He watched as the four slowly came upon a small crossing, one missing a bridge. The /rough/ river halting the four wizards on their tracks. Though what grabbed his attention was the subtle hints of magic in place. Someone had cursed the river... Placed a /condition/ over it. When he turned back to the four brothers he found them squabbling amongst each other though he, unfortunately, couldn't make any sense of the words.

The eldest brother was the first to attempt to cross, from what he could tell, the man didn't seem to want to work with the others... Or perhaps it was more out of pride that he'd wanted to solve it himself?

Regardless, he failed.

The second brother followed, unfortunately receiving the same result before allowing the third his turn.

Before long it was the youngest turn, however unlike the others and surprisingly enough to Rodrick who could finally make out the words.

The brother asked them to help him. Finally succeeding in creating a stable enough bridge to cross over the cursed river. As the four crossed over, Rodrick watched the youngest fall back in step, his eyes glazed over as he stared at a necklace dangling off of a nearby tree.

The scenery quickly changed the moment the youngest picked up and put on the cursed Hollow. Rodrick found himself in what looked like a basement, to his surprise he heard a voice echo from right beside him.

He found the youngest brother, only this time he was hidden under an invisibility charm. Further ahead in the room, the oldest was working away on something.

/'If only he'd let me help... I know what's missing...'/

Rodrick heard the voice echo around the room, was the stranger willingly showing him his thoughts? Or was it simply because the book had contained all of them? How did the book even get any of the knowledge? A small frown took over when he looked down at the necklace. Perhaps it was from there...

Turning his attention back up, Rodrick walked towards the eldest, curious as to what the man was trying to accomplish before his eyes widened in shock. For their laid on the table was a wand eerily similar to the Elder Wand.

The scenery once again changed after that reveal, this time, however, Rodrick felt the tension rise as he took in his surroundings.

He was in a graveyard... Ahead of him lay a grave. The words Antioch Peverell instilled into the stone.

Behind him stood the youngest Peverell brother, a look of anguish on his face.

"Why... Why now... The moment we get close to finishing the wand... You just leave..."

A stream of information quickly flew into Rodrick's head at the words, the man's brother had apparently died in an accident... What accident it was, he didn't know. Though the wizard before him looked angered.

Once again Rodrick fought off the nauseating feeling as the world around him warped. This time he found himself in a rather large room, filtered with all kinds of books, however, his attention lay in front of him as he watched the second eldest and the youngest brother interact over something.

"You really think it could work?" The second eldest questioned.

The youngest simply nodded as he held the Elder Wand out in front of the strange object.

Rodrick turned his attention towards the table and found a stone.

"We'll find out who killed him," The youngest 'svoice reverberated around the room. His senses distorting as the scenery once again changed.

And once again he found himself standing in the middle of the same graveyard, only this time, he found two graves instead of the one. The words Cadmus Peverell etched into the second stone.

"He got you too..." The youngest remarked mournfully, resigned to the loss of another brother.

Rodrick turned at the sound footsteps, finding the third brother at the entrance to the graveyard. A look of anger, shock and most of all of /fear/ as he gazed at his younger brother.

That was the last thing he saw before everything disappeared and Rodrick found himself in the blank void once again. The stranger right beside him.

"Do you understand?" The stranger questioned staring ahead.

"Were you under control?"

The man simply nodded.

"The Hollow?"

Once again the man simply nodded, "Gifts of Death require death itself to create, however, I had not known what had been going on, merely urged to create the Hollows using any means necessary. By the time I'd come to, my brothers were all dead,"

"What did you do?"

The man let off a mirthless chuckle, "I was angry and stupid and disillusioned by power. I was meddling with things I did not understand..." The man seemed to stop for a second before turning to gaze at Rodrick. "You must understand, the Hollows must always exist. While the three items you have seen can be recreated, the necklace surrounding your neck cannot. And /one/ must always exist, no matter what,"

"You tried to destroy it?" Rodrick questioned, inwardly sighing, if the first three Hollows could be recreated then that likely meant they'd existed long before the man before him had created them... Just how many people had failed its goal and suffered?

"One doesn't try to destroy death's gifts without consequence,"

"What happened?" Rodrick questioned.

"To this day, I still am not sure what had occurred. One moment I had been aiming the elder wand at the cursed thing and the next I was on the opposite side of a crossing. Awaiting my former brothers,"

"Former?"

"I was removed from history. That was the price I paid,"

Rodrick gulped down something vile at the words... "I take it you're responsible for the lack of information regarding this necklace then?"

The man nodded, "However at the time I had possessed /all/ four Hollows, it was where my second mistake had come. You see, I sought to reward my brothers, to give them what they'd all sought to create and so... I took Death's mantle and rewarded their efforts for passing the curse."

"You gave away the Hollows?"

The man chuckled, "Death was none too pleased about it, I had been the first person in centuries to manage to collect all four and I'd given them away out of /spite/,"

Rodrick merely listened in.

"I was bound to this necklace for what I had done, I cannot pass on to the next life until the Hollows are returned, That is my final punishment... Not that the Hollows had helped my brothers all that much..." The stranger added on mournfully. "Death is not an entity you wish to displease Mr Grindelwald,"

...

â€‹

Tl;dr for those too lazy to read, boils down to a fourth brother who get's possessed by death's fourth, only existing hollow, and is forced to recreate the other (main) three, his brother's lives been the cost of each one. Realising what he did after the fact, he tries to destroy the necklace and is looped back in time to the bridge, written out of history. At which point he, as a last fuck you to death, pretends to be him and gives them out to his brothers. -Canon ensues-

Any feedback is appreciated.
