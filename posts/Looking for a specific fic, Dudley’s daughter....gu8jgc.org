:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi all! I'm after a fic I read a while ago - I thought I'd saved it but apparently not ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è In it, Dudley has a daughter who is showing signs that's she's a witch, so he contacts Harry who invites the whole family round to his and Ginnys house. It was very well written, and I thoroughly enjoyed it, as it seemed to be a nice follow on from the actual books. Can anyone help please?


** It sounds a lot like this one:

Word of warning, don't make the same mistake I did and read their other one-shot "Whelped" right after you read this fluffy piece. It is probably one of the most disturbing fics I have read. Good fic too, but the contrast is a bit much.

  It's twenty one years later and for the sake of his daughter, Dudley is going to have to learn about the Wizarding World after all.
