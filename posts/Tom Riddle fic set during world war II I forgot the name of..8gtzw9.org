Okay, time traveler harry decides to go back in time to kill tom riddle. Tom becomes dumbledore's apprentice, and starts learning advanced transfiguration. There's a scene with a silver centipede. Last chapter was Tom capturing the elder wand from Grindlewald. Totally forgot the name of this fic, and somehow chrome lost my browsing history.

  DONE! Harry has defeated Voldemort, but it was a costly victory. Aberforth Dumbledore presents a plan to go back and kill the infant Riddle, but Harry will have to stay there 10 years. Can Harry alter the wizarding world's destiny? WWII and Grindelwald
