A few times through the series, Rowling mentions Harry's nighttime wanderings under the Invisibility Cloak. From all the secret passages Harry knows off the top of his head (HBP when Ron's dating Lavender), it's clear these wanderings are more than the specific stuff that we see in the book.

Anyone know any missing moments fanfics, or just fanfics in general showing Harry's crazy adventures with the Invisibility Cloak? Yes, I'm aware of the smut.


** "Yes, I'm aware of the smut" is probably the best post-script of all time.

** I like how he dosen't care what happens when he's under it. when they forgot the cloak after sending Norbert away was a mistake. But my question is why was Snape in North Tower anyway
