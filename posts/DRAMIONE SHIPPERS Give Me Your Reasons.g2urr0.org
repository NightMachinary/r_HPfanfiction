** Well I wasn't always a dramoine shipper but I started reading some stories with them as a pairing. An excellent writer I followed had written them as a pairing and I thought I'd give it a go to see what the fuss was about. 1. Intelligence was one aspect of the relationship that shippers enjoy. I can't remember the books very well I'm an old lady now but I think Draco was quite academic before the whole Voldy tasks started happening so some people have them bond through academics. 2. Overcoming stereotypes and vulnerability - Hermione and Draco have this stereotypes that divide them. Draco is higher being, aristocratic, anti-feminist, anti-muggleborn stereotype and Hermione is lower (mudblood) being, working class, pro feminist, access for all magical ability kinda stereotype. They are more than their stereotypes, they are characters who experience pain, fear and vulnerability and some stories have them bound through shared human experience and overcoming their stereotypes. 3. Sexual chemistry - they both cute as hell. I think in real life the actors are very good friends and Emma Watson had a crush on Tom Felton at some stage so that may influence readers. 4. Opposites attract 5. Conflict - It's like a Romeo Juliet fantasy where the two can't really be together because there are too many variables. So anyone who loves tragedy or angst would love this pairing. Draco couldn't hang out with the trio without drama and Hermione couldn't visit Malfoy Manor without angst. 6. Character building - Draco is a product of his environment and we don't really begin to see him as than a one dimensional character (in the movies) until he can't bring himself to kill Dumbledore. We only get Harry's perspective of Draco in the books and movies but it is plausible that Draco is as misunderstood as Harry and with the amount of Hermione/Harry fiction you could easily swap Harry out for Draco for this reason. I remember reading somewhere that Hermione is so popular to write pairings for because she is a well rounded and relatable character who is easy to pair with others because she is adaptable.

** My original reason was pretty simple. I loved both characters. Hermione was my favourite from the very first book and Draco quickly jumped up following Half-Blood Prince. It felt pretty natural to shove them together and see what happens from there, especially since I've got a major fondness for enemies-to-friends-to-??? pairings. Forgiveness, empathy, and surprising connections are major draws for most ships I enjoy.

For the characters specifically, I like pairings with a fiercely competent (yet flawed) woman and the guy who will never be good enough for her but is trying to be something better. I like that both characters have important relationships (Hermione & the Trio, Draco and his parents) which motivate them and which they'd struggle to deal with if they were to form any type of relationship. I like that Hermione cannot be easily slotted into the Manic Pixie Dream Girl or Gentle Girl type tropes which are common with this type of ship. I like that Draco is similarly a far cry from the typical Bad Boy male character since he's... Well, pretty pathetic honestly.

Also, while Cursed Child may be largely a mess, the line /I'm being bossed around by Hermione Granger and I'm mildly enjoying it/ is great and I'd be lying if I said it didn't reinvigorate my interest in the pairing.

** It's the weird trope that "opposites attract", which is not true at all, and actually leads to miserable relationships. As always, it's a dumbed down version of "differences complete eachother" - but it has somehow been warped into hatred transforming into love, which surprise surprise, doesn't happen. Of course, hormones are weird like that, and people that age can't differentiate, but in general how you feel about a person is a pretty good indicator of how much you love them.

And she /hates/ him. Much more than either Ron or Harry. They have it fine, they're just scarhead and the blood traitor, but "at least" they're somewhat "pure" - she's a full muggleborn.

I don't read fics which pair the two if there wasn't

A) a real redemption arc

B) a change of character before the books.

I'm just not into completely fucked up relationships or the tired, sexist trope of "fixing him".

** Not a Dramione shipper, but my highly uneducated guess is that the scene where Hermione snaps and punches/slaps Draco is the face awoke something in the shippers.

** Because it's fanfiction. I'm all about Romione in the actual books, but I find it more interesting to read other ships. The exception is if I'm reading a Harry/notGinny as the main pairing, then I actually prefer background Romione. I read a bit of FF back before the books ended and I dabbled in Romione stories but that was to satiate my adolescent heart's need to see them together. Once the books ended and about a decade later I entered that black hole we call AO3.

Yeah, Draco's a massive jerk in the books. But he's written morally grey and a good fanfic author can write a compelling story that thoughtfully redeems him. The books jumps from the battle to the epilogue and there is a lot of space to reimagine his life. Sure, he was a coward. He's not brave and chose to tout pureblood nonsense when he was younger but I still felt sorry for him in book 6. His support network looked a lot different than Harry's. If it's not a dramione/drarry story I still don't like seeing Draco written as an Ultimate Villain for those reasons. Snape got redemption and forgiveness (both by Harry and a large majority of fans) and why must Draco be so different?

The childhood bully history is their hardest obstacle to overcome. But again, there are some great authors that can use canon and still write a powerful story of forgiveness. It's good for Draco to grovel and make amends for his past douchiness. If that part is ignored, then I tend to skip those stories because I find it too OOC for Hermione. There's no way she'd forgive without some conversation.

I'm not really picky about ships, it's more of what I don't like then what I do but what I especially like about Dramione/Drarry is the enemies to friends to lovers tension.

Maybe what makes me a bit of a hypocrite is I find Pansy/Harry stories to be a bit odd. She tried to turn him into Voldemort. Like, not even Draco did that in DH. However, I've still read stories with that pairing because the author wrote a post-war world where that kind of forgiveness was possible. Like I said, it's fanfiction. Personally, I'm not there to read epilogue compliant slice of life stuff.

** While JK Rowling is right that the relationship isnt a healthy one in the books. They happen to be the perfect conduits for love to hate/ opposite attract/ remo juliet tropes.

Also the actors from the movie look smoking hot together. That helps.

** I'm not a shipper but I'd guess that it's the ”forbidden fruit” attracting them to it, they're the polar opposites, the bully and the bookworm, Slytherin and Gryffindor, Blond and Brunette. What else is there, (yes i know brown isn't te opposite of white but it's more common than black)

** Forbidden romances are thrilling. Isn't that obvious, half of romance books I've seen have forbidden romances. Actually most. From the forbidden vampire romances to the fobidden dork X cute popular guy romances.

Maybe nearly all of them, because all romances need obstacles and forbidden romances are good obstacles.
