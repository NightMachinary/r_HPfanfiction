Stories like this are just my style. I typically go for a more "Harry's jaded, sadistic and perverse but still defeats Voldemort and maybe gets laid on the way there"...well, forget the point I was making. Pretty sure this one fits that picture.

I think the only fanfic that I've read where I've enjoyed the insults and comments more was "The Lie I've Lived." That fiction has me rolling every time. +Goddamn Sorting Hat+

Do y'all have any recommends for me that are similar in style to Denarian Renegade and the Lie I've Lived?

** linkffn(A Fallen God by Hostiel) is the same concept as Denarian but with Loki replacing Meciel.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Elves Most Fabulous by Steelbadger) has jaded auror!Harry transplanted into Mirkwood.

linkffn(Dead Man Walking by Kitty Smith) is less insults, more gallows humour.

linkffn(Oops by michaelsuave) is less badass but plenty of crude humour.

  When Loki fell from the Bifrost he was expecting the cool embrace of oblivion, not to become a spirit and then be ripped apart and forced into the mind of a six year-old named Harry Potter. With no physical form, he must keep the boy alive if he seeks to keep existing, and everyone knows that the best way to ensure continued survival is to simply become greater than everyone else.

  Go back to the beginning, that was the plan. Stop Voldemort on the cusp of becoming a dark lord, stop him before he created his first horcrux and change history before it could be written. That was the plan, only Harry made a mistake.

** Well, the Denarian Trilogy is often considered the best crossover in the fandom (and sometimes just outright the best series, and yes, I know it's technically 5 stories), so there's nowhere else to go but downwards. I don't think TLIL is anywhere near as good as it.

Perhaps you should have a look at the actual Dresden Files? It's 15 books, and while some of them are a bit rough, it's an excellent series with a lot of FF potential.

***** I definitely agree that it's a bit rough, but the sheer enjoyability of it has ranked it among the highest in my favorite fanfictions even thought there are better written, fleshed out fanfics.

I will admit to being an avid fan of HPMOR but my tastes range all over the place. The Refiner's Fire was an excellent one as well.

** I think I have suggested this once more before, but anyway: linkffn(The Fallen Renegade) is based on Shezza's series. Or, it is a fanfic of that fanfic, if you will.

It has a WBWL premise, and as is the case with most wbl fics, the first chapter that sets things up might cause a bit of eye rolling (ok a lot) but it features a bastard and smart-aleck Harry pretty well. It gets especially fun during the Hogwarts arc (starts at about chapter 12).

Edit: Forgot to say that it is abandoned, but it is still fun while it lasts.

  He hated his life, his relatives, and most importantly, his own weakness. So when he chances upon a Denarius coin, he took it, even if it meant damning his own soul in the process. And now, he's a Denarian, the host of a Fallen Angel, and the Fallen is hungry for vengeance; and for him, absolutely nothing will stand in his way. Based on Shezza's Denarian Renegade. Slight HP/FD.
