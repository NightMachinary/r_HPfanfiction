Dumbledore had 'sources' and the knowledge of the prophecy to tell him that Voldemort wasn't dead. He may have suspected Horcruxes, but he never knew till he saw the Diary.

If Voldemort never made his Diary, or Malfoy never released it. What if Dumbledore died, never knowing about them and thus Harry and co never knew either.

Would the ministry be able to figure it out? The Aurors, Hit-wizards, Unspeakables and other randoms on the side of 'Light'. Short of contrived plot device "Hermione goes to the library to 'research' and comes back knowing everything about Horcruxes and immortality in 5 hours", would anyone have come up with a way to defeat him?

After Tom, Dumbledore removed the books from the public library, but surely Hogwarts isn't the only place where Books are available, specially in a world where instantaneous copying is possible. The way the books make it sound, Dumbledore(existence in general, not Toms) and Tom were the only people who knew about Horcruxes before he told Harry.

Not the best place maybe, but HpFf deals in AU's a lot, so felt like a good place to ask.


** 'The Secrets of Darkest Art' was in Hogwarts library, so this knowledge shouldn't be that exotic.

If Slughorn knew, then Unspeakables, highly experienced Ministry officials, many accomplished wizards from dark families should also know.

Since the Dark Lord showed himself to be immortal, others should have guessed horcruxes even by the process of elimination.

Of course, JKR would have none of that due to her plot reasons.

*** I'm personally surprised how everyone didn't know about them XD

The names of the books themselves stand out. If I was a Hogwarts student with a pass or access to the Restricted section, I'd certainly want to read books named 'Magick Moste Evile" or "Secrets of the Darkest Art", the very names beget curiosity.

***** Since Tom doesn't have his nose buried in a book, or speak in limericks, we can safely assume neither of those books are cursed.

Though that is an interesting explanation for Hermione's pathological need to read books.

Also, Ron's explanation sounds like it has more to do with providing excuses for his aversion to reading than anything else.

** Slughorn also knew of them, though not the specifics of how they were made. Whether he might have shared this knowledge with others following Voldemort's rise to power is a bit iffy. The Flamels, having been around nearly a millennia and having interest in methods for immortality may also have provided information.

I think the key difference in a 'Dumbledore dies before realizing the truth' scenario is that it would take a great deal longer for the good guys to figure out that Voldemort had more than one backup life preserver.

Actually, their best path to finding out about this without Dumbledore's involvement would be Harry's link to Voldemort's brain. That could provide the essential clue to an Unspeakable or experienced Healer that soul-shenanigans are in play.

*** Since Slughorn's primary interest was himself, I don't think there's any evidence to suggest that he would come forth with his knowledge, particularly as it was based on one conversation among the hundreds that he may have had with students over the years. Dumbledore's experience in trying to get Slughorn to reveal his memory suggests that Slughorn tried to repress the truth, even from himself. Also, since Slughorn doesn't seem to be that intellectually inclined (and horcruxes were an obscure kind of magic), he may never have connected the horcrux conversation with Voldemort's vulnerabilities, thereby further exonerating himself from stepping forward. It was a contrived plot device that Dumbledore even knew that the conversation between Slughorn and Tom ever took place.

I agree that Harry's horcrux link with V would probably have been the best way of even stumbling on the split-soul scenario. However, given Harry's weakness with occlumency, I image that V's influence would corrupt Harry before the necessary could be extracted.

**** If Slughorn wasn't intellectually inclined and yet knew about Horcruxes, than that would make him most suspicious. I personally think he knew, at least enough that it revolted him, but he knew. He may have considered it for himself till he found out what it entailed. that would make more sense for a self interested person. Also, he was hiding from Death Eaters, that means he had connected at least the fact that Voldemort had particular reason to want him dead.

***** Well, to be fair, Slughorn does fish for people of fame and influence to bathe in it, so he might have actually had a pupil who was into history of dark arts or something like that and learned from that pupil during one of their meetings. If that were the case then it would be nothing more than a piece of trivia to him, a dark and potentially dangerous piece of trivia admittedly but still trivia, which means he didn't know the actual dangers of this stuff and what made him try to change his own memory was the realisation that Tom actually wanted to use this information rather than learn it just to know it.

Admittedly, one cannot be a high-grade potioneer without actually reading stuff, but we don't really have anything to suggest that he reads stuff to gather knowledge rather than just because he needs it for something and just the stuff he needs, so it could go either way.

**** Given the propensity of wizards to suffer from accidental and sometimes intentional human transfiguration, I doubt that it would be a direct correlation. For one thing, Riddle is the only one we're aware of that ever made more than one. Herpo the Foul was known to have made one, but his appearance was never described as inhuman so much as ugly. Salazar Slytherin was described as monkey-faced, but we have no indication that he had made a horcrux, nor why someone so focused on snakes would trend toward a primate-like transformation.

**** I always thought that jkr had implied that he underwent many other magical transformations which made him unrecognisable. My Headcanon is that he underwent a ritual which accidentally disfigured him, and being vain, he undertook further rituals to reconstruct himself and make himself look terrifying, rather than merely disfigured.

**** My headcanon regarding that is that some rituals made him a bit different, but he was never a snake thing before he fell for the first time. What I think happened was that he drank Unicorn Blood. Unicorn Blood saves your life from just about everything, but is also eternally curses you. We never hear about the curse, but it make a huge amount of sense that the curse is to change the body to reflect the state of the soul. That's why Voldemort pops through Quirrels head, because he is a parasite attached to his soul, and the unicorn blood makes this physically visible. It also explains why a chunk of Voldemort's soul looks like a scaley baby, and why before graveyard scene, we was a scaley baby. The graveyard ritual strengthened his soul, by adding components like his father's bone, the flesh and strength of his followers, and blood of enemy, which came with a magical blood protection for free. The base material was unicorns blood and snake venom, because once Voldemort had a body, he could strengthen it's​ existence with unicorn blood, while binding himself to reality with his familiars venom.

** The Department of Mysteries seems to deal in prophecies and arcane artefacts. If you brought a horcrux to them, they'd probably be able to identify it. They didn't receive a horcrux (active or not) in canon, as far as I know.

Slughorn would have known, or at least suspected, once Voldemort returned.

** jk never really explained what makes one piece of magic difficult, or even what being powerfully magic meant. perhaps there are things which make the possibility incredibly unlikely, otherwise every death eater would have one. sometimes it seemed like you kill someone and rip your soul out. sometimes it seems like even a great evil dark lord like voldemort shouldn't have been able to achieve a single horcrux easily.

*** I think the 'terrible act' Rowling describes is the ripping of the soul itself. Most wizards didn't do it because your soul is where most of your emotions come from (Rowling envisions having your soul taken out, as being in a state of eternal depression). It's likely that the terrible act is then splitting your soul because you would be risking your after-life, and your ability to call upon more powerful magics that require great amounts of certain emotions. Voldemort was only focused on the darker aspects of magic, which only required two emotions to fuel them, fear and anger, so he left those emotions inside of himself.
