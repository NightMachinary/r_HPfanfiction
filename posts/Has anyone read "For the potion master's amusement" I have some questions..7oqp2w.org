So it's 87 chapters story and I've reached chapter 22 (the one after she jealously tears pages from the journal he gave her). I have a number of other seemingly interesting HP fanfics in the pipeline and I was wondering if at some point will we see any plot in this book (as it stretches up to 87 chapters) or is it all the same till the end?

I like how it's going and how dom/sub is written and handled, but every new chapter i find myself looking for some story in it and regretted having spent another previous chapter looking for it.

If anyone has read it, would you please tell me if there is one or shall I abandon it?


** It's a slow burn for this fic but there definitely is a plot once they leave Hogwarts. You'll find that the majority of the story is based around their relationship dynamic though.

** I was obsessed with FTPMA and loved every second of it... granted this was several years ago so maybe it hasn't aged well but I remember really loving it!

*** I am liking it as well....till now. Do you remember it having a plotline apart from the sub/dom thing?

**** I really liked the story, but it's mostly the sub/dom thing IMHO. What plot there is mostly revolves around their relationship, just like [[/u/firewhiskyepiskey][u/firewhiskyepiskey]] said above.

** It's one of my favorites. It really develops more once they leave Hogwarts.

** I... No. Not much plot, no. It's mostly relationship and smut I think.

Also the Snape is a tool.
