Right. So, I'm currently writing a fic and I need a couple scenes that simply highlight the friendship that exists between Harry, Hermione, and Ron. And I've got nothin'. My brain just keeps spinning its wheels without getting anywhere - pretty soon it's just going to catch on fire.

So, anyone here got a good idea for a trio friendship scene that I can use? It should take place in second or third year, and not reference any of the main plot points of the series. Just something light and fun where they are seen to be just happy hanging out with each other. Like a weird, quirky conversation during homework or something.

Any ideas?


** A good startinng point could be all of three of them doing homework. Then Hermione finds something weird she doesn't understand and Ron explains how the weird thing is actually a Wizarding custom that is actually a staple of their culture. Cue Hermione explaining why it's actually insane, Harry nodding along but not wanting to offend anyone, Ron getting annoyed that they are not getting it. End the scene with Hermione and Harry warming up a bit to wizarding customs and Ron acknowledging how maybe some things wizards do are just plain strange.

A couple of examples that come to mind that I read in fanfics are: In some story some dude liked to be transfigured into a tree and have people call him Mr. Woody. Some other character uses that as an example to demonstrate to Harry why his shit is not weird at all.

Another (I think it was on OTWTG) was a discussion about the nature of belief and how it differs between wizards and muggles - what with how muggles have basically embraced science and sceptiscism towards supernatural things, while belief is paramount to wizards, since it powers their magic. Blaise uses this to extrapolate on why the whole wizarding community treats Harry as some sort of messianic figure (Harry thinks the whole community is kinda idiotic for doing it) and Blaise points out how the public's belief is centered on Harry, because he makes it easy for them, with all the crazy shit he pulls.

*** A debate about the nature of magic isn't really what I'm looking for. The homework idea is more along the right lines, but still a bit too serious. I'm trying to get something that's just a goofy seen showing how the trio are good friends, not highlighting the differences between the muggle and magical worlds, etc.

Thanks for your ideas though!

** Working together on divination homework can lead to interesting discussions. Long conversations on what ghastly future is coming and making a contest over the funniest stories. I imagine that Ron's homework was always the most entertaining, Hermione always wrote dissertations on why divination was a sham, and Harry just gave dull boring work if Ron didn't encourage him.

** Second Year: The trio wonder what Dumbledore does on Holiday and each come up with their ideas of what vacation he would go on.\\
Hermione: He would obviously go to an academic convention. Maybe the International Alchemy Expo in Montereal?\\
Harry: How about the Beach?\\
Hermione: That's a bit ridiculous. Honestly, can you picture Dumbledore in a bathing suit?\\
Ron: Well I am now. I'm going to blame my nightmares on you.

Third Year: A snowball fight in winter on the way to Care of Magical creatures. Ron throws a snowball at Harry and misses and hits Hermione. Hermione gets him back by making a snowball go down his shirt with magic. Harry laughs at them both so they launch snowballs at him. They get to Care of Magical creatures covered in snow and laughing.

** Some of the scenes in Weres Harry, particularly during Fourth Year, such as the Hogsmead weekend and the Aftermath of the Graveyard.

*** Thanks for the idea, but I don't think I want to lift scenes out of another author's story. Apart from the plagiarism, that just seems rude.

** How about harry and hermione are having a conversation about something muggle (maybe how her older sister who is a model or photographer or makeup artist just sent her photos of a fashion shoot she worked on) as harry and ron play chess who's interjecting how weird muggle stuff is and talking about the magic equivalent (mannequins that dance for attention to show off their outfits) while hermione rolls her eyes at ron's interjections.

*** Thanks for the suggestion. Again, I don't want to go into a debate on differences between the worlds. But it's not a bad idea.
