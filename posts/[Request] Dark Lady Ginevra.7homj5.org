  Being possessed by Tom Riddle wrought changes in Ginny Weasley no one could have imagined. Six years after first finding the diary, she's reached her goal. Now, Harry and Order face their most difficult challenge: fighting a friend.

Colubrina's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12473874/1/Things-in-Common][Things in Common]] is something akin to it.

There was another time loop oneshot one whose name I've forgotten. [[/u/susire][u/susire]] might remember.

**** Are you looking merely looking for 'Dark Lady' fics - which implies a desire to rule, or merely a dark!Ginny fic? I can give you a few more recs for the latter.

***** More towards the former, but I'd like to see any exploration of the diary's aftermath
