JK is known for being a bit free and lose with how she conceives of magic, but the curse on the Defense position, I felt, was never adequately explained in canon, unless I missed something. No other spells work in that way - being somehow undetectable, and broken on the caster's death.

How do you curse a job anyway, if it changes every year? That sounds more like a fairytale witch's curse ability rather than the way spells normally work in the Harry Potter universe.

Finally, was it ever actually confirmed that the post /was/ cursed, or is that itself just suspicion in the fandom or between the characters? If anyone's read good explanations for any of these points, it'd be great to hear them.

** I've always wondered if Harry took on the curse himself when he taught DA in fifth year. They did get caught and the group broken up.

I believe JKR said in an interview or Pottermore or something that the position was definitely cursed and the curse was lifted with Voldemort's death.

*** I think there was one person who already attempted to explain the curse as it was. The explanation actually made sense if you thought about it, and boiled down to the following:

It worked on anyone trying to teach people Defence Against Dark Arts, no matter the name of the position or whether it was official or not (so Harry got hit with it). But it had the loophole that it wouldn't work on anyone more suited for the position than Tom. And what it did was basically hit the one trying to teach with what they didn't want to happen most ... well, you could say with what they feared most, that is one way of saying it. And the curse stopped working with Tom's death not because he died but because he no longer was suited to becoming a Defence Against Dark Arts professor which automatically triggered the loophole.

** From Forging the Sword:

#+begin_quote
  The introduction had finished by informing the reader that those modern spells were not what this book was about, and if that was what they were looking for, here were a few books to look up. (Harry had noted down the names quickly, then continued reading.) What the book was about, the author had continued, were curses in the old sense of the word. Magic called down by blood or death or bitter grief, human will and human hate twisting wild magic with emotion, creating something that lived, not sentient but far more complex than a mere spell. Emotion and intent creating a hook that anchored itself in the power of the natural world, a true curse was both subtle and dangerous, pervasive and persistent, because it was no mere spell to be blocked, or object to be purified and destroyed. Old curses were malice embodied in magic - and it was a magic that could and would and did kill.

** There are canon spells that work like that. Fidelius, for example, doesn't fade but weakens a lot on the caster's death. Suddenly everyone is 'the' secret keeper, as we saw with Grimmauld Place.

Though, the Fidelius is also a weird spell. Look at Godric's Hollow. In theory nobody should still be able to find it, because Wormtail only betrayed the secret to Voldemort (as far as we know). It might be possible -and highly probable- that the spell stopped working with the deaths of Lily & James, but how exactly that works has never been explained.

*** My operating theory about the Fidelius is that it specifically has to be used on a location whose owner is part of the enchanting, and that the Fidelius can break if the secret no longer applies: i.e. 'The Potters live in the house at 106 Matchstick Court in Godric's Hollow' would no longer be true when the house lost its roof or the (adult) Potters no longer lived.

** linkffn(11488906)

It was explained in Potter vs Paradox I believe. I'm not sure which chapter it was in but the conversation began with the Blacks' tendency to die young being a curse of the same sort if that helps at all.

As to why someone would want to curse a teaching position? Maybe Voldemort fully intended to return to that teaching position and he wanted to make sure it was vacant when he arrived.

** Seventh horcrux has a Tom Riddle curse the position when he doesnt get it. As all curses or spells require some clause (the fidelus hides you from everyone but you have to trust someone with the secret) the curse would be lifted if a professor were hired who would have been better than Tom.
