In the recent unpopular opinions post, [[/u/InquisitorCOC][u/InquisitorCOC]] pointed out how underutilized Slughorn is as a character and how a good example of a Slytherin he is. I was hoping you all could recommend some fics with a Slughorn that's appreciated and we'll used.


** linkffn(Faery Heroes). It has excessive bashing but Slughorn is great.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny

** He's pretty good in Hogwarts Houses Divided. Not a MAJOR character, maybe, but he gets some really good moments where his Slytherin qualities shine without him becoming a villain. I especially like his response when people are angry that the Slytherins did not stay to fight at the Battle of Hogwarts:

#+begin_quote
  ‚ÄúHere comes the House That Ran,‚Äù muttered Lee Jordan darkly.

  ‚ÄúI beg your pardon, Mr. Jordan!‚Äù said Professor Slughorn, his cheeks coloring. Harry frowned at Lee. He knew that was what some of his peers called Slytherin House, but he wasn't happy about Lee saying it aloud, especially here. Were they doomed to rehash old grudges every year?

  Behind them, Hagrid rumbled, ‚ÄúS'true. No offense, Professor, I know you stayed to fight, but all the others---‚Äù

  ‚ÄúAll the others /survived/,‚Äù said Slughorn, with ice in his tone, ‚ÄúI sent my students to the only place they would be safe if Hogwarts fell, while the other houses allowed children to fight. You may take pride in the number of Gryffindors whose names will be read today. I take pride in the number of Slytherins who are still alive.‚Äù

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

*** Never though of that. He might have done okay in Hufflepuff, but I think he would have been a better Ravenclaw. He was kinda loyal to Harry later, but it never struck me as a core trait of his. And his loyalty to Harry was more because of guilt. He did seem to love knowledge and learning which is why I'd say Ravenclaw

**** I was thinking more of how he's a real networker. He seeks out interesting and intelligent students and people. He keeps up correspondence with all his slug club members. Remembers them fondly. Harry doesn't really participate in slug club so slughorn doesn't have very much reason to be personally loyal... Only as protective or helpful as he would be for any other student.

  Inspired by a post on Tumblr, this is a AU story set during Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts, with one big, foul-mouthed difference. Instead of Horace Slughorn, the position of Potions professor will be taken on by...Gordon Ramsay.
