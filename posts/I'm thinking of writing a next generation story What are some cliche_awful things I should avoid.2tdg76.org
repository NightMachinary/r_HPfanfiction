Title says it all. I think I want to make a series about Al Potter and Rose Weasley's time at Hogwarts. Nothing's set in stone, but I have some ideas. I've also got a timeline going, but before I get too deep I want to know what are some things I should avoid. Anything cliche/shouldn't be repeated/cringe-worthy. Go :)


** I don't read a lot of next gen fics, but one annoying cliche I've noticed is making the kids carbon copies of their parents and constantly comparing them to the previous generation.

** Fics that stand out to me think beyond the fanon; that holds true to any era, any genre. Many fics assume that readers already know what the characters are supposed to be like because of canon or how they're portrayed in other fics, and the shallow characterization is very obvious. It's this---not the cliche itself---that makes a bad story.

So I'd say that you should always question your initial ideas and headcanon, because I think many people miss out on much more interesting stories by blindly accepting assumptions. Al and Rose are often best friends; more than that, the Weasley-Potter clan is often extremely close and harmonious---why? All families are a bit dysfunctional, disagree, have black sheep, etc. Which kids would actually take after their parents? Which take after an uncle? Who were bad parents?---it doesn't have to be intentional. Harry was probably very busy and with his childhood, probably spoiled his kids too much; maybe they're brats. What about the other side of the family, the not-so-famous sides? Hermione's cousins, the Dursleys? What does Albus know of Vernon? Is there a reason why you'd like to write Al and Rose and not Hugo and Roxanne? Once, I thought I wanted to write Rose and Scorpius heist fic and made the girl Cho's daughter instead---less people in the cast were related to each other and it felt better in my head; many next gen Hogwarts seem to only host two families or only Gryffindors and Slytherins. Are the trio kids talented? What if they struggled with mediocrity?

Anyway, I could go on and on :) Hopefully that gave you some ideas?

*** No, thank you! That was excellent. I like what you mentioned about Harry probably spoiling his kids. I don't know if you've ever seen the Avatar: The Last Airbender and the sequel series Korra, but one of things that really struck me (and it's not really a spoiler) was that the main cast in the first story turned out to be pretty bad parents. And just that nod to the illusion of perfection really made me think. I kind of want to get into that with this story...series, if I'm honest with myself.

I do have a strong draw to Albus, because of his horrible name and being the middle child in a famous family. But I want to include more of the cousins and other "new" characters as well. We shall see. Nothing's set in stone. I'm still brain-storming.

**** I love Korra! I love the unglamorous takes on the old and new cast; it was rougher but more ambitious than A:tla in characterization--Toph's family is the pinnacle. They stole the whole show.

I'm glad I could help! I write and read a lot of next gen, just usually not ones that star Al and Rose as mains. If you make any headway, feel free to message me if you have any questions or need an initial read through :) I would love to see more next gen authors here.

**** I could see them spoiling their kids because neither of them had much as kids. But on the other hand, Harry knows what happens when you spoil kids, and Ginny had a perfectly happy childhood without those things. I tend to think of Harry as someone who enjoys spoiling his kids but who has very zero tolerance for "but I wanted the red oneeeee" behavior.

If you want to distract yourself with some reading, check out loveadubdub's take on the next gen, especially [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4260581/1/Lessons-Learned][Lessons Learned]]. It's next gen but it's like the anti-thesis of fluffy next gen. Everyone is imperfect, none of the kids are well-adjusted, all of them need a good shake, and yet it's so freaking realistic that it's almost depressing. You can totally see how they ended up where they were and why they're making the choices they make.

**** According to JKR, Harry and Dudley are on "Christmas card terms."

That does not imply that Harry still speaks to Vernon/Petunia. Actually it doesn't even imply that Harry's children have met Dudley's children.

To be honest, I doubt that Harry would be interested in continuing a relationship with Dudley if Dudley hadn't semi-removed himself from his parents' clutches.

You have somehow forgotten the rest of those quotes from JKR.

However, I know that after Dudley's brave attempt at reconciliation at the start of Deathly Hallows, the two cousins would have remained on â€˜Christmas Card' terms for the rest of their lives, and that Harry would have taken his family to *visit Dudley's when they were in the neighbourhood* (occasions dreaded by James, Albus and Lily). (Src: jkrowling.com)

Harry and Dudley would still see each other enough to be on Christmas-card terms, but they would visit more out of a sense of duty and *sit in silence so that their children could see their cousins.* (src: J.K. Rowling's comments at Carnegie Hall)*

** Scorpius/Rose. Albus in Slytherin bffs with Scorpius. Neither particularly awful, actually my favourite Next Gen story has both but they're done to death.

One thing I recommend is playing on the whole "famous" aspect, it seems to get ignored a lot.

*** I haven't read THAT much Next Gen, but I do see a lot of of what you mentioned. I do like Albus in Slytherin, but maybe I can twist it up a bit. Thanks for warning me about the Scorpius/Rose. Nothing's set in stone, but thank you for input. What's your favorite Next Gen story that you mentioned?

Another thing, I do see some of the "famous" tropes, but they either overshoot it or miss it completely. I'll have to think about how to do that correctly.

** Albus in Slytherin. Seriously. /He didn't want to be in Slytherin./

We know so little about this character, and yet people just decide that he had a personality transplant on the train.

He freaks out at the idea of maybe being put in Slytherin. Harry tells him that there's nothing wrong with being a Slytherin, he's still freaked out. The idea that Harry wouldn't mind him being in Slytherin doesn't seem make a difference. He doesn't calm down until Harry tells him that the sorting hat takes his choice into account (i.e., the sorting hat wouldn't arbitrarily put him in Slytherin).

I have no clue why people constantly put him in Slytherin. And part of me thinks that Ron wouldn't have made the joke about them being disinherited if it didn't seem as though both of them would land in Gryffindor anyway. I honestly think it would be hard /not/ to be a Gryffindor after growing up in that family.

As for Rose, I imagine Rose to be who Hermione would have been if Hermione had:

a) been raised in a family that valued bravery, outspokenness, and a certain amount of disrespect for authority.

b) learned from a young age that she had to be loud in order to be heard.

c) had her poor social skills minimized by the fact that she always had built-in friends in the form of blood relatives.

d) been hailed as "just as clever as her mother" by a number of people.
