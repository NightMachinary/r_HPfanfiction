I stopped reading about a month ago, because I got tired of the tone of this fic, Harry is too depressed and cynical in my opinion. Does it change a bit? Or gets more interesting? I couldn't get very invested in his character but I thought maybe there is something that can change my mind


** Funnily enough, I think it just finished today, the most recent chapter is titled 'Epilogue' and features a time skip. With a fairly happy ending.

What part/s in particular didn't you like?

*** It's not a particular part that I didn't like, just Harry's cynism I guess.

I'm surprised it's finished already, I guess I'll read it then, it is of good quality after all, if a bit depressive.

** Ooooh, it's finally finished? Maybe it's time to read it through.

I, like you, stopped around a month ago. There are plenty of things wrong with it, in my opinion, but nothing that cannot be ignored:

1. Visiting many canon stations for no reason.
2. Continuity errors, for example with Hagrid and forest detention, and with Skeeter interview at the wand weighing.
3. Lots of typos.

** --*Warning*: probably spoiler and I haven't finished this fic so not a complete perspective.--

Yeah, at some point I just figured that it wasn't worth subjecting myself to the sheer depressiveness of the situations and attitudes that were apparently everything that was left. In the beginning I felt like it could be an interesting fic where the main mechanic would lead to a kind of tainted and emotionally turbulent but nevertheless hopeful attitude. But it was just a drag where everything went to shit at the point where I dropped it.

If Harry, the main perspective through which I'm experiencing the world, is emotionally dead and has no apparent emotional investment in the world anymore, then how can I?

*** Honestly, I feel the author took the wrong tone with the story. Harry knew he was always going to wake up again after dying, so that Harry took on a paranoid and depressive bent felt wrong. He should have become less cautious, imo, and experimented more.

***** I think it would be more freeing to know that if you die you go back in time than to know that if you die, well, you die.

******* Yes, I know what you mean, but it doesn't make Harry very appealing or interesting, I thought we would see a more reckless Harry, instead we got paranoid and unmotivated (beyond surviving) Harry.

*** Yeah. That Harry could easily end up like Henry Morgan from Forever TV series who experimented with all kinds of way of dying. In a lot of scenes, I ask the question of why the hell he is not just commiting suicide. Something went wrong? Just commit suicide.

But in the end, it's a relatively good fic. Ending is also nice.

*** I'm not saying it's the wrong reaction, only that it made me less interested in this fic at some point because Harry is to "lifeless" or emotionless. I don't really know how better to put it.
