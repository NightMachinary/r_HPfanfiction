Has anyone read, Paradigm Of Uncertainty by Lori? I've seen it on a few best fan fiction lists and I've gave it a go. I've read so many fanfics at this point I'm re reading ones I haven't read for a while. This one isn't on the normal fanfiction so it was refreshing to read something new. But I just couldn't get into this one. So what I'm asking is what is so good about it, should I give it another go?


** I read it about a decade ago. It was a satisfying-ish read, from what I remember.

Pros:

- Barely Harry Potter. It got started before even GoF came out. So the author got creative.

- Technically well written

- Adult, competent Harry and friends

- Well developed OCs (there's a ton of OCs)

- Pretty well plotted, for fanfiction. Excellent pacing.

- Snappy dialogue

- Enjoyable re-imagination of the wider wizarding world and the ICW.

- Good grammar and spelling.

Cons:

- Barely Harry Potter

- Cliches abound - not HP cliches, but if you're moderately well-read in fantasy and classic literature and watched enough movies, well the plot isn't that hard to pierce through.

- Harmonian author. Hermione is mary-sueish in this, by way of having flaws that aren't really flows.

- Third part of the trilogy is abandoned.

- Unintesting final villain (the first one was great though)

I'd give it about 7/10, considering when it was written. I would probably not re-read it, but, for a first-time read, I'd say go ahead and sink your time into it.

If you are easily bothered by non-canon elements, well, this will upset you. It's extremely AU. So go in with an open mind.

*** Thank you so much that's exactly the sort of review I was after. I think you've picked up on the problem. It's takes me a while to adjust to OCs, and there are quite a few. Considering you say it's written before GoF, I am actually quite impressed. It makes sense why the characters aren't...quite right. Yet well written. I think I'll give it a miss as you've said the story isn't quite complete. Thanks again.

** I read it about when it came out. It was easily one of the best fan fictions I ever read. Not sure if it held up, but it's quality writing. I recommend it.

** It's been years since I've read it so I'm not sure if the plot would still stand up, but IIRC the writing quality was excellent.
