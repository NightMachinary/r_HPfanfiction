Found this on tumblr and wanted to share it. I'm also fleshing it out a bit more.

Basically, Regulus doesn't die, but instead basically replaces Snape. Snape still exists, but he's just a Death-Eater making a life as a potions master.

My only absolutes are past Wolfstar(particularly an awkward third year of Regulus working with his older brother's ex), Regulus and Sirius both being convinced their the good brother, and a scene where Sirius somehow walks in on Remus and Regulus having a casual conversation about, like, Harry's grades or something.

Also, to note, I don't quite believe that Regulus would have the same attitude towards Harry as Snape did. A) I think Regulus would have enough sense to reserve judgement until he met Harry, and b) I don't think Regulus was targeted the same way Snape was. Wether it be they simply didn't pay as much attention to him, or Sirius didn't actually want to hurt him, it doesn't quite matter. If you haven't guessed, I really like Regulus.

  Regulus agrees to be a spy for the Order of the Phoenix shortly before Voldemort's downfall. Thirteen years later, he's a reluctant potions master under the watchful eye of Albus Dumbledore, just trying to get through his days without cursing the meddling Headmaster. Now Regulus's estranged brother has escaped from Azkaban, and Dumbledore has had the grand idea to invite Sirius's pet werewolf to teach at the school.

** I remember reading that tumblr post! I took the concept and twisted it slightly, making Regulus a ghost rather than the Potions Master (because I couldn't resist the prospect of delicious exchanges between Reg and Severus) - the first part is finished, if you're interested linkao3(23417602)

  Regulus Black died twelve years ago and was transported to Hogwarts, as a ghost. It's not the place he would have chosen to linger for all eternity, but he supposes it's pleasant enough.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.
