Imperius is quite possibly the darkest spell in Harry Potter. If you can't resist it someone could make you do anything. Amortentia? Legal Slavery. Myrtle? Massively perverted voyeur. Umbridge? Actively tortured students and got away with it, outside of her Centaur experience. Are there any I've missed, and any fics that touch on these, as well as the morality of it all?


** There are a few more super dark things, that are usually ignored:

Askaban is a torture prison. You are punished by being tortured for however long you are there, that's about as middle ages as it gets. And the Kiss is like a death sentence, but worse. Even if you do not get into Azkaban, your wand can get snapped, which means you are not allowed to do magic anymore, which makes a normal life in the wizarding world impossible. Imagine for example judges being able to take your sense of hearing as a punishment.

House elves? Legal slavery. House elves have literally no rights at all, you can torture and kill sentient beings for your own pleasure or whatever and no one gives a shit.

A HUGE one that is usually overlooked: The Wizengamot makes laws AND judges. There is no separation of legislative and judiciary.

One more horrible thing, probably the one that pisses me of the most: The teachers in Hogwarts have obviously absolutely no idea how to treat an abused child and child abuse in general is just shrugged at, you could even argue that it gets glorified. Either you have nice genetics (which means your parents were good people, because even if they did not raise you, you WILL become like them) or you are fucked. Those thousands of children that are conceived in rape in America every year, nope, they all become murderous psychopaths anyway, better not offer them any kind of therapy. aaaaahhhhh.

Just a thought:

It's worse than that. There's no separation of /executive/ and judiciary. Cornelius Fudge is able to issue a death warrant - or the dementor equivalent, at any rate - without any apparent judicial oversight, and does so at least twice.

Further, if wizarding Britain is anything like the portrayal of MaCUSA, there's no separation of law-enforcement and judiciary. ("Percival Graves" sentences two people to death and nobody bats an eyelid: this is apparently a normal exercise of an auror's authority.)

So you've got, like, only a tiny high-privileged group of elites who are disconnected from the culture of most of the magical community making the laws.

this isn't about racism of the general population or individuals who happen to be in power but about discrimination by the government itself. Of course there is racism even if muggleborns are accepted in powerful positions. Pottemore even mentions that the muggleborn minister was probably assassinated for his blood status.

It was mentioned in Prisoner of Azkaban that the ministry gave Dementors the permission to kiss Sirius for escaping Azkaban, so death for escaping Azkaban was already established procedure when the Dementor kissed Coruch on Fudges order, we have no reason to assume that Fudge could have ordered it on anyone else(legaly, not practically like Umbridge did)

***** It may not be seen as practical. It took Barty Crouch Jr. thirteen years to learn how to resist even a little bit. It took his dad (already a leader of men with an arguably very strong will) many months. We don't know if there are any ill effects from the curse afterwards, especially if forced to endure it for a prolonged period of time. We don't know if there are any ill effects on the person casting it, especially if they do it a lot or for a prolonged time.

And finally, the temptations and potential for abuse are probably just too much. Let's say you're teaching someone to resist it. Probably they will resist more strongly if it's something they want very badly not to do, right? So I'm sure any instructor with a sadistic bent (Snape teaching DADA, anyone?) could naturally gravitate towards making students do some very horrible things, and that's /in/ class

As it is now, with the curse being an unforgivable, you can just arrest anyone whose wand shows they cast it. If you have instructors authorized to teach it... they basically have a license to do anything they want to anyone. If it went too far... just obliviate them. You were teaching that too, right? Surely your most attractive students need a few after-hours remedial lessons?

It's a world where your child could be killed by magic and someone could decide you don't even have the right to mourn them).

** Here's a few: In the HP 'verse, it's more than likely that humans aren't on top of the food chain at all. Megafauna such as Dragons and Nundus survived well into the 20th century after all-and picking off lone humans out on walks as snack food could very well be how they did this.

There's also the fact that there are several human-level intelligent species kicking around, not least of which are the goblins, the merpeople and the centaurs. Though they probably share a common ancestor with humanity (or may be a recent offshoot from humanity itself), they are different enough to probably make interbreeding problematic without magic and would have fought many, many wars for commonly desired resources with their human neighbors.

What's telling is just how little this issue comes up in canon. The existence of other intelligent species on Earth is huge, but it's just glossed over. Considering how irrationally violent humans get over even slight differences of appearance and/or culture in other humans, you can probably guess just why such things don't find much room in a story like this.

Then you have the diseases. Diseases capable of overcoming a magical being's immune system, no less. Dragon pox still kills magic-using humans despite the sheer level of bullshit healing magic is capable of. Just how devastating are they if spread amongst the muggle population?

And then you have the blurred line diseases like the werewolf curse, which is as enigmatic as it is terrifying. Basically, you don't exhibit any immediately obvious symptoms until the night of the full moon, when you transform into a monstrous creature for the night. Considering just how much ground a wolf can cover over one night, a super-wolf the size of a tall human would likely be a complete and utter terror to your average village, let alone an individual human.

Then there are the other aspects of the biome that aren't really talked about. The venomous tentacula, the strangling vines, the mandrakes and others all grow in nature. That means that humans come across them, possibly quite regularly, and never report them. Some may survive long enough to be obliviated, sure. The majority, though? They probably don't have a clue of what they're dealing with and thus get munched.

And there are tons such examples in the books. Salamanders, Acromantulae, Sphinxes, Dementors and other such beings exist. Some, like the Acromantula, eat humans outright. Others kill humans simply as a side-effect to their presence. Yet more do so out of revenge, self-defence, speciesism...

So this is where the dark part comes in-imagine a world where such things are relatively common outside of urban population centers. Where the farther you venture from civilisation, the more such magical flora & fauna roam free. It sounds nice, sure, but take into account that people still live out there. Far away from civilisation, close to places where colonies of magical species live, may very well be the most dangerous place to be on Earth. Because if the beasts don't get you, the vegetation will.

Now, imagine trying to farm land anywhere near territory claimed by the more malicious entities.

**** That statement raises so many questions, starting with 'are we sure that they aren't just self-propagating curses instead, then?' and getting increasingly more ridiculous.

The main question is why, though. It doesn't make any sense for magical diseases to be so limited in scope. If anything, there should be at least one family of diseases capable of affecting both magical and muggle humans, largely because there aren't any differences large enough to separate the two populations beyond the 'they have magic' thing.

Are there any resources tackling these questions? Because that's a really strange thing and I crave knowledge about it.
