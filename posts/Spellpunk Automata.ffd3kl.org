So, we've had intermittent discussions on why the Industrial Revolution would never happen to a Rowling-Magical World, but what would happen if it did? Specifically, what would happen if an English wizard invented an enchanted item that could enchant other items on its own, thus allowing mass production of magical items? Or an enchanted item that could transfigure (assuming the canon-stated permanent transfiguration rule) items on its own?

I'm curious what we think might happen - would we end up with a magical sub-society of Spellpunks? Would Rowling-Magical and Muggle come into conflict?

Spellpunk being the Arcane equivalent of Steampunk, btw. Magic-made and magic-powered technological equivalents alongside anachronistic juxtaposition of cosmetic cultural elements (eg. Dressing like a Victorian Gentleperson while playing with your steam-powered touch-screen Ipad-equivalent).


** In canon, this kind of thing appears to have been happening for a while, with the relatively recent development of more and more "magitek" machines - like the foe glass, or the enchanted telescopes, or Arthur's flying ford, or Albus' deluminator.

Add to this that the ministry was seamlessly embedded into the London cityscape, effortlessly interfacing with technology such as telephone lines and similar, and that the ICW at least has to keep appraised of any new technologies which would mean global disclosure, I believe that this spellpunk era is slowly coming, at least in canon.

** I'm more interested in the scientific revolution that coincides with that industrial revolution.

Magic is already incredibly hacky. Subject to a rigorous scientific method, most every door would open to the magical world.

Cracking the formula to the philosophers stone is a forgone conclusion.

I mean, they'll be as gods. There's just no other way to say it.

*** Ever since I heard J.K. Rowling say it, I've always been a fan of the idea that magic can't be studied like science. Like if you look at it too closely, it changes all its â€˜rules'. Yes it has rules, but those rules are subject to change and without warning.

Which would make for a hilarious fic around the same time as the scientific revolution where some group of people try to study the science of magic and everything around them breaks because magic doesn't understand how it's suppose to act when it's being studied.

**** If it obeys causality, it can be studied. If it doesn't, it's harder to hold narrative tension.

J.K.R likes to say pretty things, but this contradicts the - mostly - hard magic system she depicted in the books.

I can imagine it being pretty great, reading the journals of a bewildered mage trying to decrypt the deeper secrets of magic. His experiments yielding increasingly bizarre and contradictory results.

***** Yeah JK Rowling is pretty self contradictory at some points. But if I said that without talking about JK Rowling people would be replying with all the times in the books that wasn't true.

And just because magic can be studied, doesn't make that study useful. Imagine if magical study took the uncertainty principle, that is the more you try to study magic the more it changes. Or if magic began to behave how the experimenter expected it to behave, so that no two studies on magic reproduced the same results.

Magic can still be replicable without being understandable which can hold narrative tension, as J.K. Rowling showed. You don't need to understand how a light switch works to turn it on.

*** Tbh I'm not really sure what is supposed to be different in your scenario than is in canon. Magic isn't really seen as some wholly misunderstood thing, but one with a curriculum, branches and understood laws. It might not be technically science since it's about the supernatural, but it's not guesswork, their equivalent of the scientific revolution already occurred.

** Basically individual magic competence becomes irrelevant, as does Hogwarts. Why study for years to learn how to perform transfiguration when you can just buy an artefact that does it all for you?

Magical capabilities like Dumbledore's go from being twice-a-century rarities to just what every wizard can do as standard.

The shift in power away from talented individuals and towards the common people results in the Ministry growing in power. The influential individuals of the wizarding world are no longer those with brilliant minds but rather those with a pile of gold.

Wizards become substantially more reliant on systems and products, and their society increasingly resembles Muggle society. Wizards begin to forget how to do magic. They used to bend nature to their will. Now they press buttons.

And so magic begins to fade from the world. Eventually the industrial enchantments fail, and there's no one left who can fix them. The statute of secrecy isn't broken because there's no magic left to expose. The wizarding world is left as a society of squibs, a sub-culture of the Muggle world with the memory of magic and a great sense of loss for the gift they squandered.

"If only Lord Voldemort had won the war," they whisper to each other, "maybe he could have saved us from all becoming Muggles."

Their only hope is an ancient prophecy, passed down the generations.

/When magic degrades/

/And Muggledom pervades/

/All wizards will yearn/

/And hail the Dark Lord's return/

**** Because knowledge of mathematics is still useful.

If you lived in a post-scarcity society in which every individual could have everything they could possibly want at the push of a button, for zero effort, would people still study mathematics?

Probably only those who found it interesting.

****** I'm not just saying that the knowledge disappears. I am saying that magic itself disappears. Like the opposite of the "Hogwarts is a really magical place" effect - when wizards start to live distinctly unmagical lives, the world in turn loses its magic.

***** But what if you're cutting up a pie for five people but two people want slices that are twice as big as everyone else's. How many slices do you need and how big should each slice be.

Or what if you eat a banana everyday and want to know how many you need for a week?

Basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are something everyone needs to know (or will end up knowing).

Math isn't something that exists in nature. Math is a language people created to help describe the world around them. People may not necessarily study it, but they will learn it nevertheless.

*** I don't think any of this follows. An enchantment process to get whatever transfigured object you happen to want doesn't seem to have anything to do with, say, learning to magically defend oneself.

IRL, it's not as if the pre-Industrial world had all the same technology as today, but relegated to a higher class of educated and talented people who could make the stuff themselves, that was then supplanted by mass production. Rather, mass production coincided with other scientific developments and allowed those to propagate more widely (e.g. cars).
