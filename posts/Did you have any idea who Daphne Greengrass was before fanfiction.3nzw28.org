** She's mentioned in Order of the Phoenix when Hermione is called to take her Charms practical exam.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione's name was called. Trembling, she left the chamber with Anthony Goldstein, Gregory Goyle and Daphne Greengrass. Students who had already been tested did not return afterwards, so Harry and Ron had no idea how Hermione had done.

  ‘She'll be fine, remember she got a hundred and twelve per cent on one of our Charms tests?' said Ron.

  Ten minutes later, Professor Flitwick called, ‘Parkinson, Pansy -- Patil, Padma -- Patil, Parvati -- Potter, Harry.'

This is also the point at which Sally-Ann Perks is confirmed as gone from Harry's year.

I honestly think the biggest wasted opportunity re: Ginny is at (IIRC) the beginning of OotP when Harry gets to Grimmauld Place and is ranting to Hermione, Ron, /and Ginny/ about how no one else knows what it's like to have Voldemort in their head. Yeah, no one else knows...except the chick sitting right next to you who was possessed by him for a year. Sure, Harry.

This is where JKR should have started building their future romance: having Ginny call him on his bullshit and give them that connection via an experience literally no one else alive understands.

Imagine if Hermione wasn't a main character, yet people still wrote her as many do; condescending and overbearing. We, the readers, accept that because we know her value and her depth, yet if she wasn't a main character she would just be annoying. I feel that's what happened with Daphne.

Sorry, but what the heck does being pureblood have to do with Jane Austen? Who did not, by the way, write about a stupid, cruel aristocracy persecuting others to protect the sanctity of their bloodlines. Middle class gentility and sharp-tongued comedies of manners are worlds away from HP fanfic. Nor are they Harlequin Regency romances.

(I can't help it - the kneejerk assumptions that abound about Austen exasperate me.)

Also, as HP names go, "Daphne" is pretty mild. It does have a mythological precedent, but it's also a fairly well-established girls' name. No cause for embarrassment there.

And this may be another subcultural divide, but in my usual HP corner I rarely encounter fics about Daphne. Astoria is a much more popular blank slate onto which writers project wizarding biases and the consequences of arranged marriages and complex infidelities.

**** Nor did I ever say she did. I, in jest I might add, made comment on the equivalency between the cultural divide often used by literature of that period and the one they wish to impose upon the Harry Potter universe.

Take Pride and Prejudce, arguably Austen's most famous story, with one of it's main narratives being that of Marriage and societal expectation placed upon people during this period.

Now can we find an equivalence within the fanfiction world of people getting married due to societal and familial expectation. What about marriage contracts, a huge mainstay in the Daphne Greengrass genre? Is there not an equivalence between the maritial expectations on the Bennet sisters and the maritial expectations so often put on characters like Daphne during stories of the 'pureblood' genre. It may not be an equality, but to say there is no overlap in genre is absurd.

Austen characterises Elizabeth as this beautiful and intelligent, yet prejudicing woman. How many times has there been a fanfiction which opened with Harry describing Daphne as the 'most beautiful girl he had ever seen' yet their first interaction shows her having a point of view developed from her prior judging of him because he's the Gryffindor saviour. Then the narrative furthers with him defying her expectations and her rethinking her policy of prejudce toward people.

Sure, Austen doesn't feature bloodline purity as a central focus. Nor, does she paint the aristocracy as stupid, I will agree. But really, manners isn't in the aristocratical aspect of fanficiton? What about all the times Harry learns he's a Pureblood heir and 'has to learn how to act like one'?

And to your last point, I think that's definitely subculture divide. There are masses of Daphne fics centred around what you personally have found in Astoria fics.

** The sad thing is that a story with the OC named "Daphne" will generate much more interest than a story with the exact same charcter but a non-Canon name.

*** It has specificity goes for it.

As far as the fandom is concerned a Harry/Daphne fic is a Harry/Slytherin-Ice-Queen fic and nothing else. Harry/OC could be almost anything. Because of the sheer size of the Harry Potter fandom I imagine most people simply pass on fics they're unsure of; there's always another page of stories to peruse.

In much the same way as a good, specific, but non spoilery summary tells you everything about a fic without detracting from a story, simply placing 'Harry/Daphne' on the fic can almost be a substitute for any summary at all.

That's how homogeneous the Harry/Daphne space is. Those stories don't even need a summary because everyone already knows exactly what the outline of the story is.

**** I think it's more a sort of "OC means it's a Mary Sue" reflex. I write Daphne as a ditz anyway :P

***** Agreed, though a lot of people (in the fanfics i've read, at least) write daphene as either the SlytheRon or ideal slytherin, or as just another minor personality, with individualized traits but minimal charicture.

That was about it. Now many, many fics have painted me a picture that I like a lot.

** I knew she was a classmate of Harry and in Slytherin. That's all. Strangely, I never really imagined her as blonde, like many do, but more like how those nymphs are portrayed in paintings like [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Apollo_and_Daphne_waterhouse.jpg][this]]

*** After reading a few fics about her, I always ignored people descriptions of her and made up my own. I can only take too many blonde ice queen stories, but god do I love a good Daphne fic.

** All we knew was she was in the same year as Harry. Personally, I enjoy her. What makes characters like Daphne, Susan, Fleur, and others so enjoyable to me is that there is much more wiggle room with their characters than saym Hermione or Ginny. With Daphne, there are common Fanon facts about her and logical inferences that you can make based on the little you know. It establishes a really rough outline that then an author can take and develop how they see fit. As others have said, many characters are rather painfully underdeveloped which is where I feel Fanfiction is so great. People take characters like that, develop them, then have them affect the story.
