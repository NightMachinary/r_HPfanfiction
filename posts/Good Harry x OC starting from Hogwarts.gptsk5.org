I have read stuff like "Grow Young with Me" which starts after Hogwarts but I'm looking for fanfics where it starts during Hogwarts.


** Linkffn(ten more minutes)

Technically not an OC.

  What if Harry had waited ten more minutes and said goodbye to the waitress in HP/HBP? Prequel, "What We Had," is now up on my page!

  After the graveyard, the Dursleys leave Harry with a muggle Spanish family for the summer. There, he meets a muggle girl who thinks (British) wizards have no common sense, and turns his world upside down while helping him deal with his life. After this, Hogwarts will have to prepare for the new and improved Harry Potter. How will his new maturity and take on life affect the war?

** I know a four story series written post GOF that has Harry falling in love with a Slytherin OC in either the final story or the one before that. He is in his 7th year. I haven't read it in about 15 years but I loved it! Let me know if you are interested.

*** What are the reasons it is hated by a lot of the sub? It is always a 50-50 for me if I agree or not when this sub bashes a fic, so some info would be appreciated. It sounds for example like it could be really trope and chlich√© heavy, which would be a reason to skip it for me.

EDIT: Nevermind, I just read through some reviews. Gonna skip this one I think.

**** I don't like it because the romance and plot are overly dramatic and angsty, with the "Will they, Won't they" completely overdone just for angst reasons alone.

It gets grating after a time, so I just skimmed over it, saw it continues like that for a long time, and then that it only seemingly resolves itself in the last part of the last chapter published.

Honestly, I use fiction to have and to escape from some of that stuff in life, so angsty, overdramatic stories that keep extending the angst just for the sake of angst are NOT my cup of tea.

PS: I don't even recall the grammar or if it's tropey, just this observation I made, it has been a few years a read it all, and it hasn't updated since.
