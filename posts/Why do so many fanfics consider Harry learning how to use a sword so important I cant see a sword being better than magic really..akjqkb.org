** Honestly, swords are so overdone and have little use other than slaying some magic-resisting creature anyway. Everything else you can do with a wand, but better.

Also many writers turn every fight into a fencing-like duel, even if it isn't the best approach in the context. I rarely see fighting with magic treated like a gunfight, for example, even though wands are a long-range weapon and it would make sense to use them as such at least in some situations.

*** If you want to slay creatures that resist magic there's a few better options: conjure/transfigure something either heavy or sharp and launch it at them (we see this a few times), but lets say you absolutely want to use a weapon, well swords are just not a good pick, a spear or really any other polearm would be better. A bow might work too, though I could see arguments against that: a longbow took a lot of training and could have some unpleasant effects on your health (twisted spines and such), bows may well lack the impact/penetration to bring down anything you'd actually need one against (whereas polearms were rather effective at handling steel plate, and would likely fair better)

** I can only speak for myself here, but I find it difficult to write magical duels and make them seem interesting, so in one instance, I turned a magical duel into a sword fight. I figure as an Auror, Harry would have learned how to handle all sorts of weapons because only the foolish depend on only one weapon. Also, in canon, there is precedence for wizards using swords--why would Godric Gryffindor have had one--and Harry does use it as do Ron and Neville.

It can certainly be a fun storytelling device as well. Naturally athletic Harry thinks that training with the sword will be a cinch, but what if Ron's better? How does Harry feel the first time he actually has to harm someone with a sword--how does it feel to run someone through with a piece of steel that he controls, to feel someone's dying breath on his face?

I think there are a lot of things you can do with the idea of learning to use a sword and it's an opportunity to add extra dimension to an already well-established character.

#+begin_quote
  The question of why a wizard would need a sword, though often asked, is easily answered. In the days before the International Statute of Secrecy, when wizards mingled freely with Muggles, they would use swords to defend themselves just as often as wands. Indeed, it was considered unsporting to use a wand against a Muggle sword (which is not to say it was never done). Many gifted wizards were also accomplished duellists in the conventional sense, Gryffindor among them.

** It would be if you are fighting something magic resistant. It could also be used as an offhand weapon, to use spells and a sword simultaneously, for blocking or offense.

That said, as a creature slaying weapon, the spear would be far better than the sword. Due to its reach, which would still be surpassed by the bow, unless you need to actively channel magic through the weapon. On that note, I wonder whether a staff that is also a spear would have been used for this. Either by transforming and manifesting a spearhead or by just being sufficiently sharp and pointy.

** Probably because swords are cool, fit into fantasy, even if it's urban fantasy, they're familiar weapons, and because they're visceral. A big part of making fights interesting, beyond keeping the tension high and the action snappy is how flashy and visceral it is. A lot of authors haven't quite mastered the art of high tension battles, but what they can do is make a fight flashy. The problem with HP magic is that it isn't all that flashy. It's certainly a light-show, but spells like /Bombarda/ seem to be the exception rather than the rule, and an AK is powerful but visually isn't all that impactful. A lot of the most flashy and powerful magic also seems to really be restricted to the upper tiers of magical ability, so there's even less likelyhood that Harry's going to be throwing around visually interesting magic. Swords thus present a solution to this, allowing Harry to get up close and personal and make the fight visceral. As mentioned before, they fit into fantasy, and more importantly, canon itself. No one goes around in canon beating up people with fists and magic really.

Although honestly, a lot of these issues could be solved if authors wrote more running battles, which would allow the battles to be more visceral.

** Magic is better than a sword, sure, until your wavy stick gets stepped on or something. But a sword is better than no sword, magic not considered in the equation.

There's also potential that training with swords can correlate with casting and duelling, both can involve a one handed weapon that you have to awkwardly wave around at your opponent, and different stances and posture can effect what openings you leave unguarded. And practicing with a 2-3 Lb sword might train muscles that'll help make your wand movements quick and snappy. It would likely also be more satisfying to practice over the summers than practicing wand motions for spells you can't use because of the statute of secrecy.

I can also see each of the golden trio getting into it as individuals quite easily. Hermione'd run off and dig up fencing manuals and make sure they're doing everything very properly and by the book, maybe she had some introduction to it through her parents? Dr. Granger and Granger met or competed in a fencing tournament in college or something? Ron would relate it to heroics, and then have fun with the physical side of it and the mental challenge of finding openings and getting his opponent off balance. There wouldn't be as much of a financial barrier to him getting involved as with quidditch, and it's expensive broomsticks, I don't think. You could have the weasleys have a few heirloom swords sitting around somewhere, or even have his friends give him equipment as gifts on some occasions without it being something he'd feel too guilty about. And It actually might fit in somewhat neatly with Ron's strengths in spatial/physical intelligence as shown through his mastery of Chess and fascination with quidditch strategy(three dimensional formation plans could easily be a headache to try to figure out). And lastly, Harry'd think it was something fantastical that the Dursley's would disapprove of quite hypocritically, considering how hard they want to be posh upper middle class. He'd love it.

**** I was figuring it could relate to some spatial awareness, visualizing where moves will go and how they can be defended against. The same with the quidditch strategy of seeing how chaser formations will force their way across the field soaring above or ducking below the other chasers, discreetely passing the quaffle off to each other to pull the beaters and keepers attention away from the chaser who actually has the quaffle. I think those sort of skills could translate to swordplay and, like, parrying gambits? Idk.

A dagger would also be a good thing to pick up, especially with tip-of-the-wand deflections like that! But I don't think a dagger would have the same heft that'd make training so physically beneficial, especially since the short blade wouldn't lever against the hand so much. If you mastered the fine motor control to be precise with a sword, whose tip would basically be an armslength away from your hand, it would merely be a matter of adjusting for a wand's specific weight and length in your movements, and you would have enough vigor for the most precise exacting fanciful wand motions at great speed without ever getting sloppy.

Also, learning a martial art isn't necessarily just about becoming a badass; it builds discipline and self-confidence. Becoming an expert at swinging a heavy metal object around that you can slice your own limbs off with is a mental practice as much as a physical one.

** Why do people pick Fighters over Wizards in tabletop and video game RPGs? Mostly for the same reason. Some people like the fantasy of being a wise wizard, others like being brave knights, and then there are people who like gish characters who can cut up anything that gets close and kill it with fire as well.

Plus, swords are an inherent staple of fantasy, to the point that they're usually designated to be the "main character" weapon. And in a setting like the one in HP, you have the opportunity to introduce /magic swords/.

It's possible that complex machines tend to have issues in the wizarding world, so I wouldn't really trust a gun to work the best. But a sword? That's a piece of solid metal with sharp edges.

** A long long time ago I read a fic where 6 of the Harry Potter characters were taught a variety of weapon skills, and they each found one that they were comfortable weilding, usually in addition to their wand, but not all of them. Think someone used a staff, or a mace, so if they got disarmed they could smack someone. But I think that was a founders era fic where learning to use various weapons was simply part of a student's learning at Hogwarts, it wasn't anything special.

In regards to Harry using Godric's swords, well, it's there, and he or someone else might as well learn to use it, because I doubt anyone would see it coming. That said, I personally believe that there needed to be more rogues on Harry's team, just sneak in and stab the DE's, vanish and sneak out.

***** Nope not the one I'm thinking of. They spoke regular English. They learned about the same plants they had. They learned modern like spells. I might be forgetting something but I don't remember them learning anything they could have learned regularly. And the whole sword thing, I can't remember the reasoning but I remember it was something like “well deatheaters don't know much about them” because it makes sense for a summer of training letting them have a chance against people so much older than them bringing swords to a gun(wand) fight.

****** I don't think they thought they'd go back, I think they grew old in the founders era, and didn't go back until they died? But I could be wrong. This must've been nearly a decade ago now, so my memory is a bit fuzzy.

******* I think we're looking at different stories. The one I remember they were told by the castle I think that they can get training.

** I cannot think of any fics with this. Then again, I tend to abandon stories that emphasize dodging/athleticism in magical combat so maybe I just didn't read far enough.

Can you list some examples?

** No clue at all. Though I've never read one where it goes into ant actual detail about him learning how to use a sword. What I /have/ seen a lot of is Harry practicing eastern martial arts for some reason.

Cut to Harry Potter age 10, "After reading some sciene textbooks in the public library, Harry decided to go train at his dojo which he started going to several years ago when he decided he wanted to go to a dojo."

*** mastering a martial art in one summer is very common. Especially fics before and after GOF. Take Judo for example after years of training and finally reaching your first black belt, you are told that you have now started to learn Judo. It takes years to master the basics, you need constant repetition/ drills to learn one single technique and then you learn them in a classroom setting which does not in any way relate to street fighting.

** I personally think the reason why wands are so pervasive is that are excellent general purpose tools. I do think that there are cases where other tools are more suitable than a wand. Also, Bellatrix carries around a dagger and Godric a sword (I know Pottermore says it was for fighting muggles, but meh I don't like that XD).
