I take anything, from a simple cutting charm on his sleeve or a conspiracy with Mad-Eye to slip him Veriatsserum up to Harry getting him arrested after the Bathroom fight for attempting an unforgivable.

No slash and no Death Eater apologism.


** (Wish I knew of a story with this)

A thought: If Malfoy had successfully Crucioed Harry, that would be the real test if the Evil!Dumbledore trope is valid or not. I mean he basically let Draco operate with impunity because "Muh innocence. Student safety, what's that?", but an Unforgivable used on a human is life imprisonment.

Edit: I'm dumb. Draco used an Imperius on Rosmerta and got away with it (though tbf, there was nor direct proof it was him), but in the bathroom case Harry's recollection couldn't really be discounted.

*** Yes! I hate canon dumbledore so much for that, second most of all! :( He literally, seriously /knew/ about Malfoy's multiple failed attempted murders that ended up affecting other students, and he /knowingly let them continue to happen anyway! Throughout the entire fucking year, he just let him keep trying, and almost killing other kids!/ That's just messed up and sick and I hate him! That's like in real life, knowing a kid brought a knife to school and he keeps trying to get a teacher alone to stab him to death, but he keeps losing his nerve or screwing up and stabbing other kids instead in empty hallways and bathrooms, and you just let him keep doing it because /oh he's not succeeding, at least they're alive!/ Dumbledore gave that exact reason at the end on the tower, all "Oh your attempts were half hearted, nobody died from it so it's all fine!"

/"I appreciate the difficulty of your position," said Dumbledore. "Why else do you think I have not confronted you before now?/ Because I knew that you would have been murdered if Lord Voldemort realised that I suspected you. I did not dare speak to you of the mission with which I knew you had been entrusted, in case he used Legilimency against you," continued Dumbledore. "But now at last we can speak plainly to each other.../no harm has been done, you have hurt nobody, though you are very lucky that your unintentional victims survived..."/

Dumbledore literally LET Malfoy keep almost killing other students because he didn't want Malfoy to be murdered by Voldemort for failing his mission! He placed, in very plain words, Malfoy's stupid life above every other student's! When he could've solved BOTH PROBLEMS AND JUST FUCKING THREW MALFOY IN GRIMMAULD PLACE AND BEEN DONE WITH IT!

Canon Dumbledore is a fucked up disturbing asshole of insane proportions and I fucking hate him too much to ever say!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**** Hate it or love it, letting canon Draco run free was a General Dumbledore move and not a Headmaster Dumbledore move. Draco's fate in the sixth book is tied very intimately to Snape's after he takes the Unbreakable Vow. As we come to learn in the next novel, after Harry, Snape is the 2nd most important person to the Order's war effort.

Malfoy's bumbling failures also provided an opening for Snape to step in and take over killing Dumbledore. Since Dumbledore had arranged for Snape to kill him, this was supposed to officially end the Elder Wand's power/curse since he died a "natural" death.

Lastly, Snape killing Dumbledore entrenches his legitimacy as a spy, and moves him up to Voldemort's right hand man, allowing him more access and information, as well as less scrutiny and greater freedom in his actions to perform key tasks in /Deathly Hallows/ like handing Harry the Sword of Gryffindor.

As a school teacher whose students are his first priority, Dumbledore was disgustingly negligible. But as a general whose priority is to vanquish Voldemort, letting Draco run free was a key element in one of the most intricate plans Dumbledore pulled in the series.

P.S. This isn't an opinion, but my attempt at an objective analysis.

He does a crap job there as well.

After HP manages to get back from the graveyard, he gives AD a few names. The man who fought in two wars previously does not do anything to have those men discreetly killed, even after they are outed at the Ministry a year later. FFS, the captured ones aren't even executed.

As a general, AD is useless. He's far too soft to be a general. I mean, he knows HP is a horcrux and doesn't kill him himself? What would have happened if HP decided to say fuck this and ran off to Australia? (I mean, canon HP is such a spineless turdball who has zero value for his own life, but miracles are known to happen)

***** I mean, he is undebatably manipulative in canon, even; the entire first book was essentially a test by Dumbledore for Harry. The traps were laughably easy, he specifically appointed Hagrid to first contact with Harry, and there is no doubt that he purposefully gave sensitive information to Hagrid, who cannot keep a secret. I think he believes he is doing good, but it doesn't make him a good person in any way.

******* Or just found a hole in the ground and covered it. Its not like Dumbledore can forget where it is, he has a pensieve; slap up some simple protections preventing spells like Point Me, and you're golden. One thing I never got about Horcruxes; why hide it in Hogwarts or the Gaunt place instead of making a random stone your Horcrux and dropping it into the Mariana Trench or something? No one is going to find it that way.

********** More reasonable people don't really make Horcruxes. According to both Dumbledore and Hermione (JK mouthpieces), the tearing of your soul is genuinely awful. There's no recovery, and the immortality gained is just a step up from drinking unicorn blood. So generally, the people making Horcruxes are crazy fuckers like Voldemort

As for the whole "dropping it into the Mariana trench", you have to wonder if you can come back through a horcrux physically. Tom Riddle nearly did it through the diary, and that would have been impossible to do if the diary was stuck in the bottom of the mariana trench.

******** Dumbledore mentions that it's possible to track Dark Magic in HBP, so it needs to be somewhere accessible that you can access readily but magically ward from easy detection. And the thing is, wizards seem completely immune to water pressure. All the Triwizard entrants swam to the bottom of the lake while still keeping (even in Krum's case) mostly human bodies and had no issues there, so I don't think the trench is any safer than anywhere else other than being annoying to swim down. As for the object, well, who'd want a random rock to be the container for your soul? Given the above stuff, you might as well use something nice if you can.

********** Well I'm assuming people know about the Horcrux otherwise there's no need to hide it that deep down. :) And water pressure kills pretty soon after diving down. After just a couple hundred feet (about 40 meters) you're not going to survive the pressure unassisted, you only have a few minutes before it kills you. And absolutely no one thinks it to be a problem for the wizards, all of them (besides Fleur) reach the bottom without mentioning any issues with it. Remember, all the contestants retained their human bodies. Harry just had Gillyweed, Fleur and Cedric used the Bubble-head Charm and Krum only Transfigured his head.

It's right in line with what Newt says in Fantastic Beasts. Wizards have subtle physiological differences from Muggles. That's why sturdy objects flying at, what, a hundred miles an hour (Bludgers) don't kill them when they hit their faces.

**** That's why I tend to ignore HPB and DH when it comes to characterisation - every character, but Dumbledore the most, is ruined in order to push the plot along. From Ron and Hermione suddenly thinking Malfoy is innocent to Dumbledore valuing scum like Draco more than his innocent students, everyone is acting out of character and like an idiot.

In most of my stories, Dumbledore would rather kill a Death Eater than risk, much less sacrifice, an innocent. And Draco is a Death Eater.

****** I disagree here. Sixteen-year-old Ron not believing Malfoy is a death eater is a sign of his maturity from twelve to sixteen. He's less likely to believe a wild theory and is far more measured.

​

You have to keep in mind that the Voldemort follower doesn't mean Death Eater. The Death Eaters are a tight-knit group who's number is 20-30 with a max of at most 50. Prominent Voldemort supporters like Greyback were never inducted with the mark, so Ron is right to disbelieve a schoolboy from a disgraced family would be added to frankly, a very elite group.
