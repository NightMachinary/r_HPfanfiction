:END:
I recall reading a bit, but not finishing, a fic where somehow there were 3 harry potters in the world. I think one was evil, one was good, and one grey, or something like that. At least one of them was with Daphne and I think one was with Hermione, but I don't remember.

  Our choices define us. When Harry and his closest friends are transported to an alternate dimension, thirty years after the war's end, and forced to face the results of what would have been if only they had chosen differently, he will discover just how true this is. Features H/G, H/Hr, H/DG. Not multi.
