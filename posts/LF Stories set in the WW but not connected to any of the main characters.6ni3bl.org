  Cara is a young muggleborn who hasn't had very many breaks in her life. Then she dives head first into the weirdest world she could never have imagined by accepting a letter to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where she is sorted into Hufflepuff and proceeds to be a wrecking ball to a school where age old house prejudices still exist. OC nearly all the way.

  It's 3003 and Rowena Potter is nearly finished with her sixth year at Hogwarts. A mysterious object found in the Forbidden Forest opens her up to a world of adventure - one with implications about her past, the history of the world she thought she knew, and a future she has to make for herself. (Second place in the Original Character Competition!)

#+begin_quote
  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.

** linkffn(11860644) has mostly all OCs from what I remember. Ignore what the main characters are listed as for the most part. It's next gen by the way. Also linkffn(6536945) has all OCs except with some Death Eater last names like Yaxley or something. This one takes place during the Second Wizarding War, so '97 to '98.

#+begin_quote
  The story of a Muggle-born criminal, a Pureblood supremacist, and an ex-Auror on the run during in the Third Wizarding War. Expect a lot of violence and some swearing. Mostly canon compliant.

#+begin_quote
  Slytherin House isn't what it used to be. There are barely enough children to fill a classroom, let alone a House Table, and the Quidditch captain is a muggle-born fourth year. For a new generation starting at Hogwarts as the war drifts into memory, there's far more to learn about the four Houses than they could ever have imagined (prequel to Snake Bites).
