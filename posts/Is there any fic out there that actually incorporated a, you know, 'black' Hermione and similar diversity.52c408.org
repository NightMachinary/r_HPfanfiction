** Well, I don't see that kind of diversity really worth directly exploring in the HP-World, because of how that magical society works. Purebloods don't seem to care what color your skin is, but rather your magical ancestry (muggle, magical or only partially human). You can still explore those kinds of issues by going with partial humans (and thus still fitting in with the worldbuilding): part-Veela, Goblin ancestry, werewolves and half-Giants are four we see in canon, and this list could easily be expanded.

But to answer your question, no, not really.

EDIT: For clarity of what I meant.

** It's a very minor plot point in this story linkffn(11792471). The fact that Hermione is part black comes up when they're discussing house elf rights.

  Harry's been learning about pure-blood culture, with Pansy's help, and trying to blend in as an ordinary wizard. But will all his attempts at seeming normal be ruined when they find out he can speak to snakes? His Slytherin friends take the news differently than the Gryffindors. Smart!Harry, Sane!Voldemort. Complete. Part 3 of "Perfectly Normal".

** My headcanon has ALWAYS been that she's at least partially jewish-black accounting for frizzy hair and cafe au lait skin kinda mentioned in the beginning of book three so basically every one of my fics she's---what's the term for black and jewish? Blackish doesn't sound right. Jack is obviously not it.

Anyway, my hermione has always been dark skinned but the lack of skin color based racism from draco and the like just never made me bring it up.

Edit: ahahahaha the term is blewish! That's fantastic!

** I don't know about a black Hermione or anything, but I think there was a fic mentioned here a few times with a transgendered Hermione in Slytherin or something. I know it's not skin color, but it still sorta counts as diversity.

*** Is Session Transcripts the fic you were thinking of? It has a really interesting portrayal of transgender Slytherin Hermione, although I thought the Severitus portion of the story was a bit heavy-handed and not really my thing. linkffn(7508449)

  What happens when a brain damaged Harry and a transgender Hermione both get sorted into Slytherin? Snape's not sure, but he thinks it's likely to be an interesting term. This story follows various first years through the trials of their first year.
