Here's the trick though, it has to be bashing, but not for the sake of bashing. As in he's a manipulator, but he doesn't want Harry to suffer at the Dursley's. He just thinks he knows best(which he may, but that's not what i'm looking for).

Thanks,\\

** Building Doors by JAWorley

Author summary: After Harry blows up Aunt Marge and catches the Knight Bus to Diagonalley, he decides to take charge of his life when he learns he's being sent back to Four Privet Drive. Harry spends the summer turning life in Diagonalley on its head, trying not to worry about the murderer Sirius Black, and attempting to avoid Severus Snape. In the midst of this he finds himself embroiled in an intense legal battle against Albus Dumbledore to decide his future. For the first time his fate rests solely in his own hands, and depend on the decisions he finds himself being forced to make. Harry wishes he could just be a thirteen year old boy, and begins to wonder if he'll ever have the childhood he desires the most. Some of the warnings listed just as a precaution for things mentioned or alluded to.

** Not recent, but perhaps maybe one you haven't read before or overlooked, With Strength of Steel Wings by AngelaStarCat. Harry starts believably growing in power from a young age. Get's taken in by a muggle who uses orphans to find suspicious things in suspicious areas (magical items). The whole thing is a slow written/well-developed story. It's unfinished, but it got pretty far, sitting at over 700k words. It features a Harry who doesn't trust Dumbledore's machinations because Harry has some secrets of his own. And a slow realization that though Dumbledore may have been important in the past and made good decisions before, it doesn't mean that he is now. PowerfulHarry! takes a completely different route than usual stories and it's really fun to read :] linkffn(With Strength of Steel Wings)
