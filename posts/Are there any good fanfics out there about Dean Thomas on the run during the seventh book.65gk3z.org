I'm currently rereading Deathly Hallows and just finished the chapter where the trio overhear Dean, Ted Tonks, Dirk Cresswell, and the goblins. I thought it would be interesting to read more about them and their time on the run. Are there any fanfics out there about that?


** TobermorianSass/postmodern potter has some background on the muggle-born resistance that is, frankly, delightful. Dean and Justin Finch-Fletchley deal with Snatchers and Death Eaters with guns.

  In the war, Dean holed up in hollows and friendly attics and Muggle pubs. He drew Umbridge the Toad, noseless Voldy confused by the last dozen plus years of wizardly pop culture, the Ministry of Magic with its fingers stuffed in its stuffy ears. He drew Snape as Headmaster, his sneer easy after seven years of notebook margin practice. Dean drew the Dark Mark over London's skyline and he left his work nailed up around Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade, Godric's Hollow. He signed his name. He had things he wanted to say. There were long days when he didn't talk to anyone-- walking old fields and long roads, sleeping in haystacks. There were long weeks when he only talked to strangers-- passersby, shop owners, sympathizers, snatchers who he traded curses with. He drew the Gryffindor Common Room, hearths all ablaze. He listened to Lee Jordan's radio show on the crackling airwaves. He drew his little sisters, who had gone to France with his mother and father. He drew faces from the darkened boys' dormitory-- Harry's long bangs hiding his scar, Neville practicing his dance moves for the Yule Ball, Ron asleep with his head on his thick Weasley sweater, Seamus grinning at him over a three a.m. game of cards.
