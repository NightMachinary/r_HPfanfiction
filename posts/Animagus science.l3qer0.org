Okay so I think this belongs here but say like Sirius ate raisins or chocolate smth like that then transformed to padfoot or ate them AS padfoot would he get sick???? What if any of them ate raw meat?? Technically their anatomy has to change but well magic, so would they process things as humans or as animals? Deer are omnivores btw!


** I assume that if he ate something edible to a human while he was in human form, that food would transform to something edible to dogs when he transformed to dog form.

*** And I would believe the reverse is also true. Ie if he eats something as a dog that would normally be bad for a human it would transform to something safe to humans.

If it's Safe for one form, it will remain safe when you switch to the other form.

*** Ok Damn just deleted my message lol,,,, but uhhh do you think If say Sirius ate chocolate IN dog form he would get sick or be fine?? If you think he would get sick do you think he'd get better when he turned into a human again??

**** I think that would depend on how the animagus transformation works in the universe you imagine. I've read fics that what happens in one form translates directly into the other. So a wound to the leg in your animagus form translates to a wound to your leg in your human form. I've read other fics where when you transform to your other form and any wounds that had been suffered are not present in the other form. Allowing either time or getting to help to fix the problem.

Now that deals with physical damage. The question is what happens to food? If it doesn't transform to something "safe" then in your example if Sirius chows down on a lb of chocolate just before he transforms then his dog form should get sick. And transforming back should fix the problem.

Maybe what happens is that magic protects the transformation such that if the food is "safe" for that form when eaten, then when you change forms the the energy/nutrients remain safe in your other form.

Or it could just be that since he is not really a dog and only takes the shape of one and the abilities (not the internal biology) then what he eats has no impact on his dog form unless it's poisonous to his human form.

**** I think he'd get sick. I also think that if he ate chocolate in dog form, then transformed into human form, the chocolate would transform into something poisonous to humans, so he'd still be sick.

This goes with how it generally seems that physical conditions carry over. When he was a dirty, scrawny human, he was also a dirty, scrawny dog.

** If someone caught, killed, cooked and then ate Prongs(James) in his animagus form, would it count as cannibalism, d'you think?

*** I don't think we ever see a transformed animagus die - would he transform back on death, like the wolves do in the excellent documentary American Werewolf In London?

*** I saw this asked the other day, and it depends on if he turns back into a human when he dies.. the meat would be deer but he was still human so,,, maybe not cannibalism but morally not very good

** There's nothing inherently bad about eating raw meat, aside from parasites. We have evolved to much more efficiently extract nutrients from cooked food, but raw meat won't harm humans, unlike how chocolate poisons dogs.

You've now got me peckish for steak tartare, which I make with raw horse meat.
