Hedric (Harry/Cedric) is a really cute ship that I'm currently obsessed with but I can't find many good fics for the ship. Anyone know of any?


** Fanfiction has cursed me. Sorry for the pain of this, but my mind automatically went to Hedwig/Cedric on reading the title.

Incidentally, my favorite fic with Harry/Cedric, is actually Harry/Cedric/Cho, and really cute.

  ‘Have you tried everything?' Hermione asked insistently.‘Yes! Every time I get to the cup and Cedric doesn't take it with me I go immediately back to my bed in the morning. But all the times he is with me, he dies and after I fall asleep I return too.'‘I guess it is obvious then, isn't it?' Both Harry and Hermione turned to stare at Ron, who looked at them defensively and shrugged ‘You have to go with Diggory and make sure he survives.'Harry/Cedric - Groundhog day AU

** I like fics that unsettle me so I don't know if that's your cup of tea but the two Hedric fics I've enjoyed that are not /too/ popular so you may not have read them

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17414504/chapters/40992482]])

This is probably my fav Hedric fic. It follows a mentally unstable Cedric who becomes obsessed with Harry. I like my obsessive romances.

The second one's linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13622355]]) it's about a Cedric who doesn't really have moral qualms and sets about wooing Harry because he wants the best of everything for himself.

Hope you enjoy!

  Cedric demands only the best of himself, and for himself. The best marks in school, the best position on the quidditch team, and the best reputation. When it's time for him to begin dating, he won't settle for less than the best partner, as well.

  Prisoner of Azkaban AU: After the Gryffindor-Hufflepuff Quidditch match, Harry finds himself striking up two unlikely friendships. The first is with Hufflepuff's captain, Cedric Diggory. The second is with the Grim. You know, that canine specter of Death that's been trying to kill him. Between that and learning the Patronus Charm, surviving Sirius Black, passing his classes, training for the Quidditch House Cup, trying to figure out why Professor Lupin treats him so strangely, helping Hermione fight for werewolf rights, and more, Harry seems to be in for yet another busy year at Hogwarts. (Tl;dr: an alternate canon for POA, featuring crushes on handsome Hufflepuffs and canine Marauder dads.)

  Harry makes three rules to survive fourth year: 1) watch the new DADA professor like a hawk, 2) suspect all animals of being animagi, and 3) avoid Cedric Diggory at all costs. Shame Diggory didn't get the memo. For a tumblr prompt by johnlocked-starkid: maybe a Harry/Cedric thing where the Triwizard Cup isn't a portkey and Voldemort doesn't happen, and instead they just win together and are happy and celebrate together. (bonus points for shy confessions of a crush from one or the other)

  They passed through the barrier and found themselves in Kings Crossing proper, everywhere thronged by children also back for the summer holiday. Any one of the smiling adults could be Harry's relations, so Cedric kept his eyes sharp for lanky builds or unruly dark hair or bright green eyes, amid all the joyful reunions going on around them. It was hard not to be infected by the celebratory mood.Maybe a summer holiday in the peaceful, uncomplicated muggle world was exactly what Cedric needed.
