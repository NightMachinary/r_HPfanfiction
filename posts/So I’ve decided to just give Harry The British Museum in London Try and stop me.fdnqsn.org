The Evans name is synonymous with archaeology. For centuries the potter line had been known as the Liberal Lions of Magical Britain. They were the commanders on the front lines Of every magical conflict going back to William the conqueror. When the Potter Dragon roared sounding the call to arms every Wizard in Britain answered, even the Welsh. And when no enemy presented itself tried to Invade England shores, the Potters turned their Tactical minds to magical Politics , Charlus Potter . Was know as the Liberal Dragon of his day, many a piece of Legislation was put to a flame went he raised his voice against it. Charlus and Fleamont kept Grindelwald's Forces at bay for nearly a decade before Dumbledore finally got up the nerve to act. The Potters were forever watch wizarding Britain back. It was an inherited trait pass down the family line One generation to the next. Through Fleamont and Charlus to James and onward to his son. The last son of the Britain's greatest Defenders , Harry James Potter. What the British empire called the Potter warrior spirit, Harry called like his Father before him, The Potter's Damned Luck. A Potter could let a matter rest when they knew No one else would pick it up. Harry inherited his reckless bravery and protective instincts from His father's side of the family But while the potters were known as the Warriors of Magical Britain. The Evans Line were known as a more Curious sort. Just what did Lily Evans pass on to her son, What kind of Legacy could she possibly leave That's my equal her husband's contribution. The Evans clan were not known for their warrior nature Or business acumen. No They were known for something far more distinctive, They were the great explorers of Britain, Historian, Adventures, And with more recent generations Archaeologists. Harry potter May have inherited the will to fight from his father, but he got his Thirst for adventure and curiosity from his mother.

What kind of wizard would Harry Potter grow up to be, If he grew up knowing his mother's father, Head curator of the greatest museum in the British Empire.

More importantly what kind of Curse Breaker would be , After he for filled his duty as a Potter. ( Defeating a dark Lord and rescuing an entire nation from Darkness and damnation Tends to satisfy the potter legacy rather early in one's life) . How will Harry Live up to his mother's side of the family.
