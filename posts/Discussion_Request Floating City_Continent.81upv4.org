any Flying City stories?

Like maybe a Story were after the Horror that was Wold war two and Seeing the power of the Nuclear bomb The International confederation of Wizards takes notice of the Progress the Muggels had made over The first half of the 20th century and they Predict that within 200 years the muggle will find magic no matter what they do leading to the Most Ambitious magical project of all time.

The Creation of a Floating Continent to which they will move everything magical.

They start in Japan and move everything but the Muggleborns onto the Continent taking everything everything magical even the land that there Magical stuff sits upon leaveing Giant Craters in the Ground were they have Taken the land, adding to the new Continents mass.and then Over the Next 40 years they move from Country to country Moving everything magical onto the Flying landmass.

The Flying Continent is the reason that the ICW Didn't interfere in Voldemort's first rise they couldn't even though he was a massive Risk to the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy they need all hands on deck over the years as they moved the Flying Continent around the whole world. until the Only Magic on Earth not on the Flying Continent was is in England(who has been moved to the back of the Queue) , Under the Sea or New muggleborns.

Do you think that the Wizards of harry Potter would be able to make and hide a Flying Continent?


** My fic Lords of Magic had a floating city. This was a massive AU however.

Canonically, I don't believe that HP magic could do such a thing. HP magic can do almost anything but only within a relatively limited range(1). "Time and space matter in magic" says Snape. Being able to cast a spell over an entire city at once is not a piece of magic that seems possible. Supporting this, Hermione comments in GoF that she's not sure if McGonagall would be able to transfigure something the size of a dragon due to how big it is (interestingly, she specifically identifies the size as the problem, not the fact that /it's a dragon/). That implies that "dragon size" is around the upper limit of scale for a skilled user of HP magic.

It's true that in DH, Flitwick and McGonagall both cast spells over all of Hogwarts. However I'm not sure how much we can infer from this, given how little we know about how Hogwarts' protections work. Were they casting fresh protections out of nowhere? Were they activating or otherwise reinforcing pre-existing protections? Hard to say, and therefore hard to draw conclusions. But at most it would mean extending the maximum scale to around Hogwarts-size, which is still well short of city size.

Of course the magic system has clever ways to get around the physical limits - casting magic on abstract ideas and information which has no location (Fidelius is magic on a secret, Taboo is on a word). But it's not clear that there's an abstract medium which would allow you to levitate a city.

(1) This is one of the many reasons why I consider the "could magic stop a nuclear bomb?" question silly. There's actually there's two separate issues in that question. Firstly, can magic create a zone of safety within the area of effect of a nuclear bomb? Secondly, can magic stop a nuclear bomb in its entirety? I would submit that the answer to the first is "yes", given magic's ability to override physical nature within the range of a wizard's magic, whereas the answer to the second is "no" - not because the bomb is too powerful, but because the area you need to cast magic over is too large.

*** That would only be true if one /did/ try to levitate the entire city at once. What about building a city ex nihilo from a lot of individually-charmed levitating stones, that you could then assemble into a platform?

On the subject of the bombs, I think that thinking about how magic could protect from the blast is thinking about it the wrong way. They need to cast at the bomb /before it hits the ground/. Hit it with /Arresto Momentum/ before it lands and you're safe, it might even be really easy to Vanish it.

That seems impossible from a different perspective - magically possible, but logistically beyond wizarding capabilities. It would be such a massive project I can't see it getting off the ground (pun intended).

Re: bombs, getting to it before it explodes would of course be ideal, but I'm not sure how likely it is. Surely it would require you to be in the right place at the right time, and very quick reaction times on top of that. Seems to me that locations enchanted in advance with protective spells are the best strategy.

Most modern nukes are airburst and have a final velocity between Mach 1 and 10, depending on the delivery system. Good luck hitting that with "arresto momentum" while it is still miles away. Also, MIRVs are a thing.

I would put a caveat to your answer - if and only if the witch or wizard designing the protective spells for it is aware of what to create a protection from.

**** I don't believe that magic works that way.

Firstly, I think you have identified the wrong category of knowledge as being relevant to successful magic.

Consider transfiguration. It's possible to transfigure things into animals which are physically identical to real animals, despite not knowing about that animal's biology or chemistry or really knowing much about the animal at all. The magic fills in the detail for you. What you as a wizard need to understand is how the magic works, not the non-magical details of the result.

Secondly, I think you are misunderstanding the conceptual nature of HP magic. It doesn't run off physical values or work via physical mechanisms. The shield charm isn't a filter system running off a list of definitions of things to stop.

The shield charm is protective. Its nature is that it will attempt to protect you from harm. It doesn't matter what the type of harm is, because the magic is capable of distinguishing for itself what is and isn't harmful. We've seen the shield charm adapt for various different situations depending on what the harm in question is, whether it be a physical or magical threat. The caster doesn't need to tell the magic this, because it doesn't run off the caster's subjective intent. Magic itself has a concept of protection "built in" to its rules.

I never said they need to know the non-magical details. But they need to have a concept of what they are defending against. They need to give magic a direction. They do not tell magic "protect me" with their spells and then magic looks around decides which danger to apply itself to, the spells tell magic "protect me /from this/". And with some of the dangers from a nuclear weapon they need to know that a particular danger exists in the first place to devise a defence against it.

Otherwise you get wizards erecting a shield charm in the direction of the explosion and dying very surprised torn apart by the blast winds.

*** I was thinking of it being a bit like a magical manhattan project. Exept it's being done by the best magical mind from all over the world.

I sort of see it as them creating the core of the city/continent that they will slowly add to over time as they move from country to country.

I guess one of the questions is that if you put the Continent under the fidelius charm and then add to its mass over time will the new mass be hidden by the secret. I think it would provided you worded the secret right like"the magical continent is hidden in the sky" doesn't matter how much mass you add to the floating land mass it doesn't change the fact that it is the magical continent.

It would be easier to put permanent magics on a small corner stone of what would grow to be there magical continent. Then for them to try to put permanent magic on the finished product.

** IF I were to write something like that, I'd make the Wizarding World live in a slightly shifted dimension - like an empty version of our world. The entrance would be located on an flying Island made from Granite.

The only way to access it would be to go to the entrace - another island, located on the Pole of inaccessibility. I'd make it look like an old, gigantic pyramid. Made from perfect slabs of Granite. It would be perfectly clear to anyone, that this construct was made by a higher power (than the regular human). Stairs would lead the way up to the Arc, in which a simple Floo Hearth would sit, waiting for Magicals. It would be framed by two Gubraithian Fire.

How would I go and have my characters create something like that? After decades of bloody war, Harry Potter and subsidiary his parents, ended the reign of the most terrible Dark Lord. The magical world was close to being annihilated by Dark Lord and Muggles alike. The thread of magic was getting out of hands, for the regular people. In the aftermath a more ruthless Minister decides - enough is enough. A plan was concocted - use Sacrificial Magic to create a dimensional rift. Send in dying prisoners, and let their death fuel the ambient magic. The more people live and die there, the stronger and more stable the dimension becomes.

And so on and so on. Well, look at that. I managed to type all that while waiting for my Netflix Movie to load!

I was at first thinking the magical world would create something like a giant empty pot plant but then thought in the magical world there might be some truth tot the saying "magic's in the air". so Instead a Giant hollow sphere.

The Wizards designing and making it would have to world in Shifts so they could Use felix felicis to make sure that the project was perfect.

First they would make the sphere out of common crystal so that is was easy to carve the giant runic array into the whole sphere before having Nicolas Flamel use the philosopher's stone ability to transmutation of common crystals into precious stones and diamonds to make it into a Better Substance than crystal at channelling magic.

Then to Charge the Magics of the Sphere they would use A fusion reaction along with a Magical energy conversion array to use the energy from the fusion reaction to charge it.

Then they would Transfer everything magical under the earths crust and all things living in it into the Sphere, then using 90% of the sand that powers time turners they would Speed up time inside the Sphere so 20,000,000 years needed for the environment inside the Sphere to stabilise would only take one year.

Next they would transfer the magic in the oceans and all things in it before using 9% of the time turner sand to Speed up time so that the 2,000,000 years needed for the environment in the Sphere to stabilise again.

Next the Magic in the atmosphere before using age speed up time for 200,000 years. using 0.9% of the time turner sand

next would be the transfer of all Non-sentient magical life that is not living under wards before speeding up time for 20,000 years inside the Sphere.

They would begin the transfer of all NON-human magical Sentient beings. which would also include the second last time the environment inside the sphere would need to be sped up for 2000 years.

Then they would begin The process of going from Country to Country to manually transfer all Magic left. The magical civil war caused by Voldemort would Cause England to be Skipped over when the rest of magical Europe was transferred into the Sphere causing the English wizarding world to have to Wait more two Decades before it was there turn.

IN the 90's when all but Magical England had been transferred to the Magical continent. It would undergo the last Period of time dilation with Time being speed up so that 200 years pass on the Inside while only one year passed on the outside.this time with all Magical life(including wizards) apart from the English being inside when it happened.

Then work would begin for The transfer of all magic in England with The World Cup and The triwizard tournament bith happening in england to help cover up Negotiations from most of the Wizarding world while all Non-Human magical life Being slowing transferred over.

this were Going smoothly with the Transfer of THE English wizards to be announced at the end of the tri-wizard tournament until Voldemort Returned
