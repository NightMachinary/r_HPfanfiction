** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3780602/11/Invisible][Invisible]] has Harry as a Potions Master before he is 17, and it has new potions and a few creative uses.

I should warn you now, it's a Harry + Snape slash, as well as a Wrong Boy Who Lived with some Neglectful, if not outright abusive James/Lily. I know some people find faults with some of those plots.
