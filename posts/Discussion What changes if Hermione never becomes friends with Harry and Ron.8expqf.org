I noticed that in a lot of AU stories, Hermione still becomes friend with Harry (or Harry and Ron) even when it doesn't make sense for it to happen. So that got me to thinking... what would be different if Hermione never becomes Harry and Ron's friend on Halloween night? For simplicity's sake, assume everything else is the same.


** First year could go several different ways depending on what happens to Hermione.

If Hermione dies to the troll, the public loses trust in the school security, Flamel takes back the stone, Voldemort leaves. It's a relatively quiet and uneventful year after that but that loss of trust might convince the ministry to start interfering at Hogwarts sooner.

If the troll event doesn't happen and they simply never become friends then the rest of the year progresses as expected just with much less certainty about exactly what is happening, eventually ending up stuck at some stage in the stones protections (the logic puzzle if nothing else) and having to wait for Dumbledore to get back and confront Voldemort.

Beyond first year anything goes really, the potential for divergence from canon events is already ridiculous by this stage and there is no reason to expect anything else to happen in the same way.

Honestly if we make the assumption that the same events happen even in the absence of Hermione then I expect that in most of those events Harry would end up dead.

*** Agreed. Even if Harry never fought the basilisk, they were already in the process of shutting down the school after Ginny was taken. Hermione, even petrified, was integral to the plot.

Now I'm curious if there's any fanfics about the school actually shutting down ðŸ¤”

** Most people here seem to be looking at this from a harry/general world perspective and doing a good job, but not really exploring how Hermione herself may be changed as a result and what that would impact the story.

First it is important to remember that Hermione was not Harry and Ron's friend when they went to save her from the troll. So in my mind there exist 2 possible ways the night plays out that result in Hermione not being their friend at the end of the night.

1) Harry and Ron go to save Hermione as is canon, however Hermione tells the teachers the only reason she was even near the troll in the first place was that Ron had been making fun of her earlier. She while thankful for being saved is too prideful to admit that she needed help, and Harry and Ron feel insulted by her never thanking them for saving her life.So they don't become friends.

2) Harry and Ron decide not to go themselves to find Hermione and instead tell a teacher/prefect that she is missing. A search ensues and Hermione is found and rescued by a teacher, and ultimately a friendship never forms.

I honestly think it is highly unlikely that Hermione would die that night, assuming like you said everything is the same EXCEPT the end result being they arent friends. Harry still has his "saving people" thing which would drive him to either help her, or alert a teacher or someone to the danger.

So Hermione survives the night and the trio never forms what next? I think there is a strong case to be made that she and Neville would likely end up being friends. Both were outcasts within their house and Hermione's apparent need to nag people about school work coupled with Neville's poor performance in class, coupled with them both having underdeveloped social confidence and a thirst to fit in somewhere, would in my mind almost force them together.

Beyond that I don't see much changing for her first year, i think she does exceptionally well in her school work, tutors Neville instead of Ron and Harry, and carries on mostly like normal.

What impact does this have on the rest of hogwarts year 1?

Assuming Harry dies falling off the broom, it doesn't really matter what happens with their friendship. Voldemort would have killed his marked opposition, and would eventually be resurrected either via the stone, or other means, and supposedly rule over Wizarding Britain in due time.

Its actually absurd to consider that happening though because there is zero, yes zero chance that Harry would have died in the quidditch match. I can here you already "How can you possibly say that..." soo ill explain.

First given the context of the situation, even if all of the teachers suspect something may be suspicious, it does not make sense for any of them to interfere until Harry actually falls from the broom EXCEPT for Snape, or Oliver Wood/Hooch calling a time out. It is likely against the rules of play for anyone but an official to call a halt to the game for any reason except a really good one. So right there teacher's are probably likely to let it play out and trust that the captian's of the team and the Ref on the field deal with the issues. UNLESS Harry actually falls from his broom, then you know saving his life make sense for anyone who wishes to do so. HOWEVER this would likely result in an investigation as to why this occurred, and there would then be the discovery that his broom was being tampered with, and chances are the game would be rescheduled and played again later, you know for fairness. Because of this, if Snape actually suspected something sinister was afoot, given that Slytherin had at the time a growing lead, it would make sense that he would try to counter the jinx, hopefully under the radar so no one noticed him interfering with the game. Maybe, he is not trying to stop it fully, maybe he was just doing enough to keep the broom and Harry afloat.

Regardless of Snape's motivations, it makes a lot of sense that the scenario would play out like it did in canon, with no one stopping the game, even if Hermione never lit someone on fire.

So Harry would still be alive, him and Ron would be friends, they would likely still be suspicious of Snape, and they would likely have still gotten into a bunch of stupid trouble and discovered the plot to steal something, but probably would never have made good headway on the whole "what is there to be stolen?" question. That being said I do not think that Ron or Harry would have ever made it out of the Gryffindor common room, to "save" the stone. Lets assume they still tell Minerva that "Dumbles is gone Snape is going to steal the stone" and get brushed off pushing them to feel they need to save it. 1) they don't have a way to stop Neville from blocking them from leaving the common room, and 2) if they did push past Neville or hurt him etc... Hermione would 200% snitch on them and go to Minerva if first she hadn't already been with Neville and stunned them herself... so McGonagall using context clues as to where they would be sneaking off too, would likely have gone to alert Dumbledore, or just go and fetch the stupid kids from the corridor herself.

Here is the first huge unanswerable divergence then, either A) Voldemort succeeds and gets the stone. OR B) The trap by Dumbledore actually works and whatever he was planning to do with that trap comes to fruition in ways we can't predict. Either way it would leave the world beyond changed and hard to predict moving forward.

Worse yet, Hermione would probably be right there with Neville, sick and tired of them getting into trouble and pissing away the House Points she earns through hard work, and she isn't going to take it any more, she doesn't buy their ridiculous conspiracy theory about Snape, and they aren't going off on yet another ridiculous adventure if she has anything to say about it.

** Well I think a lot of it depends on if she dies to the troll. Guilt can do a lot. Harry would almost certainly feel responsible, it might even end his friendship with Ron. If he felt he failed then he might dive into his work far more than in canon and without Hermione to use as a crutch at time he might be slightly better in class. Not fanon training montage levels but more dedicated. I could imagine that without Hermione's guiding influence he might look into his parents more. With the staff aware that he blames himself then McGonagall would look after Harry more. Possibly leading him to learn more about his parents and trying to live up to their standards. His parents were super talented and head boy and girl, he could easily aspire to match that. With a closer relationship between McGonagall and Harry she'd probably be more trusting of him if he claimed someone was trying to steal the stone.

** In (roughly?) chronological order -

Harry falls from his broom in the Quidditch match, doesn't die (Snape saves him) but probably doesn't catch the snitch either. With how crap the Gryffindor replacement seeker is, this probably doesn't alter Harry's Quidditch career much, but Wood will probably complain to McGonagall. Given how often attempted murder is hushed up these complaints probably come to nothing.

The research on Flamel doesn't go as well. Whether they figure it out or not probably doesn't matter; they know Snape's trying to steal something important even if they don't know what it is. They're Gryffindors! Let's go save it.

What happens next depends on how much you believe the entire First Year was set up by Dumbledore and how much was happy coincidence. Worst case scenario, Harry, Ron and Neville (since they can't petrify him) get strangled by Devil's Snare. Best case is Harry gets to Snape's riddle and gets stuck until Dumbledore arrives.

** I really don't think Harry would die if he fell off his broom during Quidditch. There's no reason Dumbledore or another teacher wouldn't save him like they did in third year. Falling off your broom has to be something that just happens once in awhile in Quidditch especially Quidditch done by kids.

Personally, I'm on the fence whether Dumbledore meant for Harry to go after the stone and thus force the confrontation between him and Voldemort or if the trap was actually meant to capture Quirrel/Voldemort.

******* Seems way easier to cast an Arresto Momentum than engage in a battle of wills with Quirrelmort. Harry getting a few broken bones in the process is a bonus.

Here's what's actually happening: Quirrelmort is not a total imbecile and is aware that basic spells like Levicorpus/Accio/Arresto Momentum exist. Clearly he is prepared to cast counter-jinxes for such obvious rescue attempts and is trying to create a tragic accident in which Harry sadly breaks his neck.

Which means that (a) Harry is in actual danger of dying and (b) Snape needs to stop Quirrelmort as fast as possible.

***** Yeah, basically. I think that people in the HP fandom who are hardcore enough to write and/or debate fanfic tend to be very much on the studious side and tend to project that onto Harry. In reality, Harry and Ron are pretty normal. It's Hermione who's the weirdo who studies ahead and reads nonfiction in bed (and we love her for it). Without Hermione, they'd do enough work not to get weekly howlers from Molly, and no more. Ditto their intellectual independence. Forming your own independent opinions is hard work.

****** Maybe maybe not. I would say they actually would have far more incentive to work on their magic skills without someone looming over them.

******** I wouldnt care about that either when you are always put down by someone else.... But for instance using magic to get away with shit. Trying to destroy Malfoy. Maraudering around... You know its magic being good at it is just awesome.

**** Harry doesn't get the memo about the basilisk and it moving in the sewers, thus doesn't figure out where the entrance to the chamber is. In the end goes to sleep depressed about Hogwarts closing and his friends sister dying.
