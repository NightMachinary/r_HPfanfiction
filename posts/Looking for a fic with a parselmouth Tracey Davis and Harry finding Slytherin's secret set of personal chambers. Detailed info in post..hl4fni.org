:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Right, I'm not even sure I liked this fic but it has been niggling my head for months. Harry is a parselmouth and finds that Salazar Slytherin built a secret set of rooms (unrelated to the Chamber of Secrets). I think there were bedrooms, a bathroom and a lounge of some sort.

Anyway, they can only be accessed by a parselmouth. Any non-parselmouths brought there will forget about it/have some kind of memory block afterwards. (NOTE: The fic I am looking for is NOT Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin.) Harry at some point brings Cho into the lounge.

Cho and Harry have really bad sex. Harry is clearly not really enjoying it (unlike Cho) and actually finds it quite uncomfortable but powers through so it'll be over soon. While Cho is riding him Harry is convinced he can hear someone laughing. Eventually, after Cho's been dealt with, Harry finds a secret room behind a portrait or mirror that Slytherin set up to spy on all his guests.

Inside that secret room is Tracey Davis, a parselmouth that found the secret chambers before, who has been watching Harry's discomfort and laughing about it. Harry and Tracey talk.

That is all I can remember but hopefully it is specific enough. I don't think it was a smut fic but it may have been rated mature/adult. I also think it is likely to be on fanfiction.net just based on my reading habits.

And help would be appreciated. Thanks.

EDIT: Looks like this post might violate rule 8 so if you do find the fic then perhaps just put the name rather than sending good ol' ffnbot to make a link.

EDIT 2: Good news, bad news: The fic was Unchained By Lucifael. Although having glanced at it I think it was definitely a smut fic. The funny Cho bit is at the end of chapter 10. Thanks to [[/u/brockothrow]] for finding it!
