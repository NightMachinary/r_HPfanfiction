I don't even dislike that writers make students have them if they intend their main character to practise potion-making outside of lessons, but I think writers should be reminded that first years, at the very least, supply themselves from a cupboard inside the classroom and are only asked to bring their own cauldron (pewter, size 2) and a set of crystal vials to sample their potions so the professor can examine it. I just thought it would be good to note that your MCs had the forethought (and as such weren't the kind of dunderhead Snape is used to teach) to do this

  Then they visited the apothecary's, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor, jars of herbs, dried roots and bright powders lined the walls, bundles of feathers, strings of fangs and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).

  There were, however, things that Harry needed to buy. He went to the apothecary to replenish his store of Potions' ingredients, and as his school robes were now several inches too short in the arm and leg, he visited Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions and bought new ones.

  ‘Everyone all right?' said Mrs Weasley. ‘Got your robes? Right then, we can pop in at the apothecary and Eeylops on the way to Fred and George's -- stick close, now ...'

  Neither Harry nor Ron bought any ingredients at the apothecary, seeing that they were no longer studying Potions,

** Ingredients aren't on the list but in chapter 5 "Diagon Alley" of book 1 we get this:

"Then they visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop)."

Plus in chapter 4 "The Leaky Cauldron" of PoA,

"He went to the Apothecary to replenish his store of potions ingredients".

So it's clearly expected that students bring at least some basic stuff with them.

EDIT: Plus "Harry threw his books and ingredients back into his bag and left at top speed to tell Ron and Hermione what he had just witnessed" from Ch 27 of book 4. "Neither Harry nor Ron bought any ingredients at the Apothecary, seeing that they were no longer studying Potions" and "“Yes,” said Harry, “but I didn't buy the books or any ingredients or anything ---” and "You can use ingredients from the store cupboard today" all from ch 9 of book 6.

*** Except that could just have been Hagrid who remembered buying potion ingredients from his second and third year and so went to the apothecary with Harry despite the supplies list not mentioning ingredients. I also said first years. The faculty may not expect from first years to bring their own ingredients since they are beginners and they wouldn't want them to experiment with potions without being supervised while second years are ‘allowed' to since have experience with the subject.

Could also just be that Rowling didn't look back at the supplies list, although it's a bit unlikely because how would you remember scales but not ingredients, and I don't think the scales are ever mentioned again after Harry buys them.

**** That sounds like a stretch to me.

Scales are mentioned several times over the series:

“Hey, Harry,” said Seamus Finnigan, leaning over to borrow Harry's brass scales, “have you heard? Daily Prophet this morning ---they reckon Sirius Black's been sighted.”

Books, clothes, telescope, and scales all soared into the air and flew pell-mell into the trunk.

“Scales out, everyone, and potion kits, and don't forget your copies of Advanced Potion-Making. . . .”

“I haven't got a book or scales or anything --- nor's Ron --- we didn't realize we'd be able to do the N.E.W.T., you see ---”

There was a scraping as everyone drew their cauldrons toward them and some loud clunks as people began adding weights to their scales, but nobody spoke. The concentration within the room was almost tangible.

Etc etc.

***** I assume you had an electronic copy of HP to help find that many references to scales, but if not it's pretty impressive you found that many.

****** I'd love to claim that I found all of them by hand but, as you guessed, I have a text file with all the books in it. Really useful when looking for things like this or checking JKR's style of writing, for example.
