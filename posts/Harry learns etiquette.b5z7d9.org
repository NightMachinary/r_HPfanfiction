A fic about Harry learning and preferring pureblood etiquette when he learns he's at the top of the food chain. I've been looking for it for a while since I've seen in somewhere before but can find it again. Any help appreciated


** There's so many! Any more details? Pairings? Length? Rating?

*** It's like a memory of a memory for me. I know he was openly acknowledged as a half blood. They're super super intense on the social castes. Everyone stands when a Black enters and they roll up their sleeves in the presence of their superiors

**** I remember reading a story with the sleeves thing where Harry immersed himself in pureblood culture/etiquette; it might be the one you're thinking of. I can't remember its name, but I know that it was on AO3, if that helps at all.

Random details I remember are the Malfoys were anti Voldemort and that Lucius was a double agent all along, that Harry was in Ravenclaw which had a mentorship program where fourth years looked after first years. Harry's mentor was a Japanese kid, and the fic had some very basic untranslated Japanese in it. I'm gonna be honest, I was reading it as a "so bad it's good" kinda thing.

***** That sounds like the one to me. I wish I could just remember the name

**** And he was still at Hogwarts? I think I remember this. He perhaps ran away or just sort of left during the summer at the Dursley's? I read this fairly recently, I think on fanfiction.net, sorry I don't remember much else about it, if there is a pairing it was probably either drarry, snarry or haphne

***** He was still there, it started his first year. Heavy Daphne involvement I believe. Thanks for the assistance anyhow :)

** Oh, I could have sworn the sleeves rolled thing was something he noticed in sixth year after Sirius has died? I must be thinking of a different fic...

*** As I said my memory is fuzzy on but I'm fairly sure all of his knowledge came prior to Sirius being out of Azkaban. You could be correct however

**** Mm, I definitely know the story and I definitely have read what the other poster mentioned, I just didn't think it was the same story for some reason, I was just so sure there was a line in there about Harry being all â€˜wtf how have I not noticed this before??' Regarding the sleeves thing. I could very easily be wrong though- I read ALOT while sleep deprived with babies who wouldn't sleep ðŸ˜… so it's all blurred into one big universe at some points
