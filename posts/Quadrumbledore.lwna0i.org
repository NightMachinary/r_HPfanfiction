In his search for Voldemort's Horcruxes, Professor Dumbledore doesn't leave a stone unturned. Unfortunately, that led to chaotic results in the summer of 1996, when what he thought to be a clever plan backfired incredibly.

Throughout the previous school year, Severus had confided Albus with the details of Voldemort's growing anxiety. The evil wizard had grown restless due to ignoring the full contents of the prophecy, that much was a given, but there was something else as well. Something that Albus had fearfully unravelled with the pass of the years.

"The Dark Lord is missing a last piece to his collection, or so he says. The /key to immortality/, has escaped his lips," Severus had said, "You know what it is, don't you?"

Albus would answer vaguely, keeping a secret from Severus that he had known for some time now.

/Horcruxes/. That was Voldemort's macabre secret to immortality. And now, if Severus was right, he was only missing one.

For a long time, Albus thought Voldemort had already split his soul for the last time. However, the more information he got, the more he realized the snake wasn't really a Horcrux. So that's how he came with his crazy plan.

Using Severus, Albus was able to smuggle the Sorting Hat to Voldemort, being a relic from the founders, with a certain something from each one of them, it would be a prime candidate for Voldemort's final Horcrux. What of course Voldemort ignored was that Dumbledore had charmed it beforehand to recover it after, leaving a duplicate in its place.

A clever plan indeed. One that guaranteed one Horcrux less to track. Though some might think it cruel. It did require sentencing a sentinent hat to a gruesome fate. And one which acknowledged a new person was going to die in order to produce the Horcrux. But, being rational, Voldemort was going to keep killing people regardless, and using this to stop him might actually help in minimizing the casualties down the line.

What Albus didn't expect was the hat to explode.

It had happened swiftly. The moment he struck the Horcrux-hat a four coloured light filled his office and something broke him. The Horcrux was gone, that much was for sure, but so was the old Albus.

Instead, Dumbledore split, as a soul would do when making a Horcrux. Only he did so in a more notable way. He did so physically, producing more than one Dumbledore.

One would think that having more than one Dumbledore would help the war efforts, but things were more convoluted and the group of Dumbledore produced as many headaches as they helped.

A part of him that identified as /Percival Dumbledore/ seemed to emphasize the very nature of Rowena Ravenclaw, so faithfully passed onto the former sorting hat. He kept the headmaster office and the position, with the pensieve of course. He didn't like the very thing Voldemort represented certainly, but had other calling in him other than actively fighting the forces of evil. He was studious and hoped to dive into the more mystical side of Magic, as his young self had once done. Finding a revolutionary truth that would change the Wizarding World forever. He embraced academics and saw Hogwarts as his mission in life. He swiftly fired Severus from his teaching position. The man was fighting for the right side, but he couldn't have a person like him poisoning the hungry minds of his students. He fired Professor Trelawney as well, as crucial as she was, Divination had no place in her school. Percival was fond of Hagrid as well, but he put rational thoughts over the heart, and made sure to get a more competent person to teach Magical Creatures in his school. He also made sure of doing his part in the war, showing Harry all the Voldemort and Horcrux memories he had collected. Which was, in his opinion, the best way to win this war. As he favoured a no nonsense, approach he started being more straight forward with the boy, telling him of Horcruxes and why he needed Slughorn's memory from the get go, as well as passing onto him every known way of destroying Horcruxes.

The part of him who identified himself as /Albus Dumbledore/ didn't agree with Percival in much. He had channelled all of Godric Gryffindor's attributed from the sorting hat, and had left Hogwarts for a more active role as the leader of the Order of the Phoenix, fighting where it mattered. Fawkes had followed him loyally. Remus, Kingsley and the rest certainly welcomed the more hands-on approach of warrior Dumbledore and kept close contact with Albus at all times. He made sure to keep Severus in the loop, though he kept his distance from him, considering where Snape was most of the time. He convinced Severus to share his secret with at least one member of the Order (which turned out to be Kingsley), as well as some other crucial secrets. Albus argued almost every day with Percival. He struggled to find safe shelter for Sybil Trelawney, but the woman was too much of an oddball and kept putting herself in danger unpredictably, causing the Order major headaches. Even when Hagrid was still the keeper of the keys at Hogwarts, Albus kept more closer contact with him than Percival. He also tried to see Harry once in a while. Train him. Teach him how to make fire rings and some other badass spells. The worst might come for the boy any moment, and better to leave him more than just pensieve memories. If there was something he shared with Percival though, was his growing uneasiness at hiding from the boy his fatal fate.

The part of him who identified as /Wulfric Dumbledore/, was of little help. He had pulled the Salazar Slytherin traits out of the hat and his ambition was as great as it had been in his early years of befriending Grindelwald. He took the position of Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot and the Elder wand as well. He was by no means evil, but had his own agenda that didn't only include winning the war. He wanted Voldemort gone, but wanted the glory afterwards, and Scrimgeour's position as well. He tried to provide Albus good intel from the Ministry, but since they argued every time they met, they kept their personal interactions to a minimum. He reproached Albus for not making better use of Severus and Percival for being so straightforward with Harry. He tried to convince his two other parts that if they wanted to have any chance of winning the war, they needed to keep Harry in the dark until the very last second, so he couldn't back away. Wulfric was a manipulative bastard. And Albus and Percival frequently questioned if he was undermining the current minister as they spoke. He was effective though, and managed to sway the Wizengamot against the Malfoys. Also held a close relationship with Mundungus, who did all of his shady work.

The part of him who identified as /Brian Dumbledore/ and had absorbed the essence of Helga Hufflepuff from the hat, sold lemon sherbets in Diagon Alley.

TL;DR: Voldemort uses the sorting hat instead of Nagini as his last Horcrux. Dumbledore splits in four trying to destroy the hat, and the hat causes him to split into 4 Dumbledores, each one channelling the traits of one of the founders. The 4 Dumbledores are more magic power on the light side, but also a total mess all around.


** I personally think with the way you described them Percival Dumbledore would fire hagrid as a teacher, but then ensure hagrid would get a proper education and the job returned to him once he finished it

** I would think Brian would be more involved - like trying to mediate between the other parts of Dumbledore (trying to unite them like the founders were once united). Also, maybe the one most concerned about the people in the story and how they are feeling (how is Hagrid after losing the teaching role that meant so much to him? How is Harry doing torn between viewing memories and learning to fight (and his headmaster suddenly becoming 4 people with their own personalities all different from the man he knew?).

*** Oh he would definitely be good to Hagrid, even offer lemon sherbets discounts.

I haven't given it too much thought to Harry. It's a prompt, not a full story.

** Brian could have been just as important as the other 3, taking over the Supreme Mugwump of the ICW position. He could meditate between the 4 positions as [[/u/RememberThisPassword]] said, while also driving cooperation in the international community. Instead of leaning into the Hufflepuff traits of loyalty and diligence, you made a joke about them being useless.
