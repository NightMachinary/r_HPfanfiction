I'm not going to tell anyone /they/ have to like it, but I'm blown away with every rereading by the amount of actual care and concern that nearly every character is written. Almost no one has ridiculous motivations simply to push the plot along. Every aspect is slowly and carefully examined and considered so as to even more fully immerse the reader into a new Harry Potter world and a much more believable cast of characters.

And the storytelling by which we learn of the characters' histories and motivations never feels forced or shoehorned, but always serves to move the story along.

I know a lot of you familiar with the story may feel it is plodding and meandering, and a few are upset that the story isnt complete, but I'm not reading these stories simply to make another notch in my belt. I'm reading them to escape into a magical world, and I dont want that to ever end.

The Prince of Slytherin is a growing and expansive new magical world, and it's still updating. I'm reading it again, laughing, crying, getting surprised again by plot points I had forgotten and utterly enjoying every word.

I hope more people read it, and I'm so glad I found it via this sub, years ago!

** That's an oddly aggressive//confrontational recommendation.

** I was getting sad cuz I hadn't found any nice, long, engaging fix's in a while. I'd heard of HPatPoS, but I thought it probably wasn't for me. But since you posted, I decided I'd go ahead and check it out. And now I'm completely enthralled. I love the story. It zigs and zags in completely new ways and keeps the story moving so I never want to stop reading.

Great recommendation!

*** Hey, thanks for the response! My only goal was to share my favorite fic, but I did a quick search and saw a lot of people didn't like it. I guess that's where the aggression came from. I was joking, but there is always a little bit of honesty in every joke.
