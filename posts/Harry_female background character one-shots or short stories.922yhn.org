Can you recommend any shortish (<20k words) stories where Harry (or Fem!Harry) is paired with ANY female background character (Sue Li, Hestia Carrow, Gwenog Jones, Penelope Clearwater)? Preferably without the common tropes like arranged marriage/marriage laws or instant "true love". The romance does not have to be the main aspect of the story, but not just three lines at the end either.

Please no m/m (duh), positive depictions of Snape or Malfoy or cheating as a theme. Everything else goes.


** Be careful what you ask for, this is how Daphne greengrass was discovered.

*** If it gives me more Harry/Lavender stories, or some decent Harry/Padma, then I'm game.

** Are you specifically wanting smut or just a romance? Because there's tons of the former.

*** At least porn with plot. But an actual story would be preferred.

**** I'm not well-read on this stuff, but I read this one a while back and thought it was okay.\\

I think it had Harry/Katie as one of the pairings or something.

***** That one is really cringeworthy. The "dirty talk" is highly amusing because it makes even the average "Brazzers" /movie/ look like a documentary. It borders on paedophile erotica when Hermione describes 12-year-old Ginny and Luna naked in quite some detail. Pretty much its only saving grace is the realistic depiction of body parts (no porn level exaggerations). Also, I wouldn't call Hermione a background character, who happens to be the main PoV there.

****** Well, I tried to help but honestly I haven't read a lot of that sort of stuff. Sorry I don't know of one more to your tastes.
