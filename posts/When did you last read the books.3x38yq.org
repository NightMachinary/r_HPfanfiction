Really curious about this, because so many people seem to embrace fanon as canon without even realizing that it's not. Myself, I last read the series about an year ago, but I occasionally browse the books when I'm not sure about details.


** Every Christmas since 2007 when I did my first re-read of the complete series. I'll be getting to them again in a week.

*** I love this idea. Especially with how important Christmas time is in pretty much every book. Something important or meaningful happens on or near Christmas in all of them. May have to copy you on this tradition.

** I'm on my first thorough re-read after 7 years away. I skimmed them the winter right after Deathly Hallows and then left them at home when I went to college.

Man is it great to re-read these books. I didn't realize how much I've missed her writing style. And the themes and symbols go deep and really satisfy. Something I rarely find in fanon.

Fanon actually motivated me to do this. It's a love and hate relationship - so many creative ideas and love in fanfiction but on the flipside so much muck.

*** Excellent choice, that is definitely one of (if not /the/) best in the series. Avoids the usual complaints about canon Harry not earning his wins/being too soft/lazy, has amazing antagonists, realistic teenage romance with no 'true love' crap, great new allies, is lots of fun but also deadly serious and dark as shit at times. Yep I've talked myself into it, OotP is my favorite. Sorry PoA.

** i fall asleep listening to the audio books. so several re-reads per year, unless i'm just listening to my favorite parts (about 30 chapters in total) & skipping around. honestly I've listened to book 6 twice through in the past two weeks already.

** Haven't read anything after GoF since they were published, although I did recently buy a copy of a Maen yr Athronydd so I could read it to my kids.

I strongly disliked many of the themes and plot devices occurring in the second half of the original series and I don't feel as though I'm missing out on anything by preferring parts of fanon to canon.

*** When I was younger, I loved the entire series. But now I am not as, thrilled with 6 and despise 7. I prefer Fanon much more as there are just so many stories to enjoy! So much more of this universe to explore. While so much are sub par, the truly great stories are stunningly brilliant

**** I suspect the vast majority of readers are overwhelmingly thrilled with the original series in its entirety and I'm happy for them.

Fanon is so broad that there are parts to pick and choose no matter what your preference. I suppose it's the freedom of that wide range of ideas that intrigues me so much more than JKR's story.
