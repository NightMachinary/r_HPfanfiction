From when Draco bumps into Harry in Diagon Alley:

#+begin_quote
  Distracted as he was, he crashed into a rather well dressed boy with hair a peroxide blond. The boy steadied himself against the doorway before focusing his gaze on Harry. His look of surprise soon turned into a sneer, one reminiscent of his Aunt in her worst of moods. As if his very existence offended the boy.

  “Watch where you're going Weasley.”

It's on the spacebattles forum, link here: [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/immortality-is-messy-a-harry-potter-au.352132/]]

And sadly, it's only five chapters long and abandoned. Story ends right when Harry gets sorted. Still, a redhead Harry is a redhead Harry.
