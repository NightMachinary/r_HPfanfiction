So you know how all of the Slytherin fics have specialized dueling pits, the "Everything in Slytherin stays in Slytherin" policy, or a hierarchy of sorts that people need to navigate? I want to see a fic that has some Gryffindor culture and traditions. It could be special parties, rituals, or something similar to what we see in the Slytherin fics, but I really just want something that helps establish a kind of Gryffindor culture, because even in canon those kinds of things weren't really discussed.

The closest I've ever seen to that was a fic where Gryffindors would do the third-floor obstacle run to the Mirror of Erised regularly that year. But that was only valid for that year. I'm looking for something that has an established tradition in Gryffindor house.

Thanks in advance!

***** Yeah, I can see them being known as the "party" house where that stuff occurs but I can also see the darker aspects of having some absolutely brutal hazing in order to live up to the stereotypes of being "the brave house." Kinda like what can happen in certain fraternities in North American universities.

****** Idk if they would go that far. I see Gryffindors as pretty loyal to each other. Like they ain't known for their loyalty like for Hufflepuff but I can see them being you mess with one of them you mess with them all. Like I love the scene in OoTP where the twins are comforting the crying first year after detention using the blood quill. This shows the house is really close and loyal to each other.

But that's when outsiders come to mess with people considered part of the group. I can definitely imagine a Gryffindor house where people need to go through hazing rituals before they're truly considered a part of the group. Sure that's not really depicted in canon, but stuff like that happens (or at least happened) all the time in real life at military academies (both high-school level and above), uni frats, high school sports teams, etc.

******** Maybe but I can't see them doing anything too dangerous. I can see their hazing being more embarrassing or stupid than something that will get a poor first year killed. Like maybe hand Mcgonagall a can of catfood, streak through the great hall in their underwear, hug Snape, or tug on Dumbledore's beard. I don't see the Gryffindors doing something that would put new first years in life threatening danger.

The bar for "too dangerous" is a lot higher with magic, though. In canon, people can regrow bones in a day, heal broken noses or deep gashes in seconds, and participate in sports where people fly on brooms to dodge iron objects launched specifically for the purpose of dislodging others from their brooms. I can easily a culture like that developing school hazing practices where people can get seriously hurt by muggle standards because for the wizarding world such injuries are not considered that big of a deal.

******* I don't think they are loyal to each other, they abandon Harry in the chamber of secret, Goblet of fire, the order of Phoenix.

** The only one I can think of is the "[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1259006][War is for Children]]" series from petroltogo, the second (and most recent part) was updated January this year. I enjoyed the first part a lot and while I'd like more detail into the culture the conflict it causes is the main focus of the story.

Honestly outside of Slytherin, I can't think of many stories where the other houses get fleshed out beyond canon.

  In which the Sorting is less of a choice between Dark and Light and more of a fashion statement, Gryffindors are more than reckless, bumbling fools, and Slytherins aren't the only ones playing politics.Because you didn't actually believe that life is so straightforward as to be defined solely by the colour of a tie, did you? Hidden in plain sight, in the one house they least expected, Harry Potter becomes what he was always meant to be. Hogwarts beware, the Dark Lord's equal is rising!

*** Yeah, I remember wickwynn's /The Tinkerer/ had developed a lot of stuff in Hufflepuff house (although there have been others), and HPMOR had developed some specialized traditions and features and stuff for Ravenclaw, although nowhere near the level of /The Tinkerer./

Anyway, thanks for the rec! I'll check it out :)
