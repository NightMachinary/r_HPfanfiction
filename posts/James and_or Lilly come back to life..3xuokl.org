As the title says. I'm looking for a fic where one or both come back during Deathly Hallows. Preferably without a whiny pathetic Harry.

*** And there's no whiny pathetic Harry.

Has to be noted, though, that this one is the third story of a trilogy.

*** I had to post this exerpt from chapter 12:

"Ah, now this one is familiar to me," Ollivander said as he moved on to Cedric, who handed him his wand. "Ash and Unicorn hair from a very honorable steed. I see you've kept it clean." "I polish my wand every night before bed," Cedric said with a self satisfied smirk. "Sometimes my girlfriend helps me polish it. She's quite good at it. Always manages to rub it just right to get the desired results." Harry looked at his wand and noticed finger smudges and bacon grease on it, and quickly tried to clean it with the sleeve of his robes.
