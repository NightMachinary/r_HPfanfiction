Essentially characters that either

A. Were essentially not existent in the book had a non existent personality or only ever name dropped. Like for example Regulus Black, the Greengrass sisters, Pansy, Blaise, Charlie Weasely etc. But fanon gave them fleshed out personalities that you like or like versions of.

Or

B. Were focused on quite a bit but fanon interpertation is so vastly different from canon that they arguably are a different character. But you happen to like this drastically different character. Harry has this happen to him for example in Dark or Independent Harry stories, Hermione does too, Draco and Snape also sometimes get this treatment.

Also since there can be some variety in the fanon version of the characters please specify the depiction.

In the case of B what if situations dont count by default. Depictions of Draco who chooses to say join Harry's side doesnt necessarily count he could still have a very similar personality to canon.

But a Draco who is always suave and sophisticated and sensitive , and never dramatic petty or bitter would count as that is arguably not his canon personality.

*** As a bonus, I actually quite /dislike/ tactics!Ron, which I feel kinda misses the point of why Ron is a good character in the first place. He doesn't need to be a strategic mastermind who masterfully marshals the forces of good in order to have value.

**** Sure, but book!canon and movie!canon both ignore the part of his character that leads to sudden flashes of brilliance in favour of shoring up other characters, which also does him a disservice. The point isn't just that different people have different kinds of value but also that there are different kinds of smarts which are all just as valuable.

** It's not really mentioned in the books, but that guy in the pub that wandlessly stirs his tea while reading Hawking, just before Harry visits Diagon Alley. Just casually flaunting his immense magical power while reading up on cutting edge muggle science.

**** Here you go: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10522345/1/Relationship-Status-Pending]]

Warning: It's a Dramione ultimately but I think Theo really wins this one, his characterization in this is divine. The rest I could take or leave honestly.

** A.): Blaise Zabini, Pansy Parkinson, Theodore Nott, Vincent Crabbe, Millicent Bulstrode, Gregory Goyle, Charlie Weasley, Fluffy...

B.): Draco/Malfoy family, Snape (Severitus), Lupin (responsible Lupin aka non-lukewarm Remus), Hermione (non-marry-sue), Dumbledore (where he */isn't/* a slimy manipulating arse-hat). ... Draco who isn't eager to follows his parents footsteps and can think for himself. Lucius & Narcissa when they aren't all that interested in following a megalomaniac but still care enough about keeping old family traditions - minus the racist/neo-nazi mentalities - while still loving their son unconditionally. Snape a still bitter arsehole, who has a gradual character growth that leads him to make better decisions and choices. Finally opening up those so-called observant eyes of his to realize that Harry is just as much of James' child as he is */Lily's/*. Even despite Harry looking like his father, Snape acknowledges he has his mother's heart. Remus, Hermione and Dumbledore really says it all... ...

Here are some of my favorite characters who fall in the middle of both perimeters.

C.): Angelina Johnson, Cho Chang, Viktor Krum, Padma Patil...
