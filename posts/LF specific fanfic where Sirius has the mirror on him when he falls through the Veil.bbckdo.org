  What if Sirius had the other two-way mirror on him when he died and Harry found that he was able to talk to his godfather and parents though it? Not to mention, meet all those others who went before? "Sirius Black? Sirius Black!" "Pads, is that your pocket talking to you?" "I dunno, but it sounds like...no way, it couldn't have been there the whole time...Harry!"
