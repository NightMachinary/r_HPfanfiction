**** Yes! I thought about that! Since Lucius Malfoy is always bribing Ministry officials for things, why does Harry never try that too? :( He could bribe people to plant evidence on Lucius or just get real evidence from the manor and get him in Azkaban! Or he could bribe Fudge or something to look into Voldemort or to get Sirius free.

*** You would find this fic surprising then. It's in first person POV, but it turns out to be a pretty decent read.

#+begin_quote
  Six months after Harry Potter defeated the Dark Lord, Voldemort, someone decided to turn back time and change history where Harry Potter was reduced to nothing more than a myth. Strangely, only Draco Malfoy and Hermione Granger, mortal enemies at best, were unaffected by the sudden time shift. Now they must find a way to return to their true timeline as only they know the truth.

  A man appears at the gates of Malfoy Manor. Draco Malfoy isn't the average first choice for a hero sent back in time to save the world. Narcissa Malfoy, slightly surprised to see the grown man her eleven-year-old son could be, isn't the average first choice for his Horcrux-hunting partner either. Honestly, they're supposed to be on the other side in all this business. But it cannot be denied that they're very efficient, especially given their quest is relegated to Narcissa's free time and Draco is relegated to a guest wing bedroom so his father and younger self don't interfere. Nor can it be denied that if the Dark Lord isn't going to show them loyalty and victory, then... well... Family First, after all.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11377120/1/Hogwarts-Marauding-the-Timeline][Marauding the Timeline]] by Hplover4ever3 would possibly be something you're looking for. The author somehow kept Draco in character while making the story ridiculously good. Plus it has recently been updated, so I know the author is dedicated. So far it has around 332,622 words.

linkffn(11377120) Status: Ongoing

Edit: The next fic is in first person POV, but it turns out to be a pretty decent read. Also it's a crossover between HP and MCU

  "I'm Sirius Black," said the boy. "Who the hell are you?" Draco hesitated. Well how the hell was he supposed to answer this? / / Back in 1976, Draco has a lot on his hands...avoiding questions (both students' and teachers'), playing his part well, & trying himself to understand why on earth he was sorted into Gryffindor this time around. It's going to be one hell of a ride. . .
