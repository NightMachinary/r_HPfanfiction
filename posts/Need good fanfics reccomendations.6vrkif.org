** If you are not looking for a specific type of recommendation it is probably better to use the links on the right side of this subreddit. Requesting is best left to finding specific types where you can provide more detail, especially if the requests are very specific.

Here are the links on the right side for ease of access:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/wiki/index#wiki_general_recommendations]]

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3f97u2/the_most_popular_fanfics_of_all_time_in/]]

There are also a bunch of other links to things like related subreddits. Simply scroll down looking at the right bar and explore it.

** I don't want to sound overly rude but... Use the search option, there you would probably find a fic that you might like from Harry/hermione to snape/lily or even Sirius/lupin, crossovers and many more.

Then you can pick any fic you think you might like.
