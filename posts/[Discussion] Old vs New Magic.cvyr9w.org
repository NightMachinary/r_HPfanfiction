How do you prefer it done? I like the fantasy element of old magic being more powerful, but new magic symbolizing progress.


** The Harry Potter setting presents everyday magic as a sort of technology that wizards work on. Wands, floo powder, portkeys are all invented. Spells and potions are researched and refined all the time. The Wolfsbane potion wasn't invented yet when Remus was a student, but it was there in 1993 when he came to teach at Hogwarts.

Of course there's ancient magic like what Lily used to save Harry and defeat Voldemort. And of course in real life technology there's examples of ancient technology with advantages that we don't use in modern times (mostly because we have a slightly inferior way that's much cheaper). But I do think harping too much on how superior ancient magic is kind of misses the point of the setting. If Isaac Newton travelled through time to the modern day, most physics graduates would know more about physics than he did. Wanking ancient wizards/witches too much kind of rubs me the wrong way.

Still, if you go by the books, the hallows are unsurpassed and very possibly man-made.

On the other hand, Voldemort is ranked as the worst Dark Wizard in history, ahead of Grindelwald.

Yes they may be man-made, but as we don't see any other items approach their power, longevity and quality it may be that the cost to make them is quite severe. Given that the legends of their origin involve death I'm sure you can imagine some reasons why no modern wand or cloak maker has succeeded in making an equal.

****** Yes, add in those too if you want! My point is that these ancient artifacts that have no modern equivalent, and I speculated that it isn't just because modern wizards simply don't know how but that the cost is too high to replicate them. When I say "any other items" I mean items of the type. Like there are no wands that match the Elder Wand, and no invisibility cloaks that have lasted as long as The Cloak.

However, keep in mind that we never see the diadem, locket or cup having any power aside from the Horcrux effect and we never get to compare the sword to any other goblin made swords to see if it's particularly superior.

*** I think, within the setting, one of the big reasons they wank ancient wizards and old magic is because old magic seems to have done some very impressive things that haven't been replicated in the modern age, like the creation of Hogwarts. For instance, we don't have any indication that say, Malfoy Manor was created in a single afternoon using modern spells. Additionally, the wizarding world seems to be kind of bad at passing down knowledge, so it is believable that there are old spells that might surpass modern ones in important ways. Your example of some old methods beating new ones except in the matter of cost, isn't really applicable to wizards for instance.

Let's imagine that Felix Felicis is a modern potion. It is very difficult to brew, and requires expensive ingredients, but replaced a much older form of ritual magic that took months of preparation and exacting practice. The ritual form of the luck magic however lasts much longer, a whole year of good fortune in fact. Now, if you just want to sell luck to people, Felix Felicis is the way to go, despite the difficulty. But if you want the magic for your self, then the ritual is the option you would prefer. Thus, our plucky up and comer might reasonably disdain Felix Felicis, a modern invention, for the ancient (and possibly secret) magic that, for his case scenario, works better.

Direct comparisons between the muggle and the wizarding are easy to make, but the details can often make things murky. I would agree that, on balance, Dumbledore is probably a better dueler than Godric Gryfindor because Dumbledore has an extra millennia of spell creation and refinement to draw from, but we can't honestly discount the possibility of Godric knowing some forgotten spell that could give him an edge, or was eventually discarded because despite the power it was difficult to teach.

I agree is that there are amazing ancient artifacts and feats that are talked about and even shown, and that's fine. But by and large these ancient artifacts are objects to be acted upon. The feats serve as explanations of current circumstances in the setting, not expectations for what the protagonists must do. In canon Merlin doesn't come back to put Harry through a training montage that makes him super awesome and able to defeat Voldemort easily. The story doesn't hinge on Harry's use of the Deathly Hallows, but on Voldemort's obsession with them, particularly the Elder Wand.

So to me the point of canon is not "ancient magic is amazing and powerful, if you need a power up just find a lost McGuffin or old forgotten tome and you're good!". That's a fantasy trope, but one that Harry Potter largely misses. The point is that power, of all sorts and origins, corrupts. That we can't see clearly unless we stop obsessing over these trappings and start caring about what's really important, like love and friendship.

All these words to say that fics that start bringing in ancient magic (especially if someone from centuries past trains Harry) that insta-defeats modern magic or start putting the crux of the story on possession of ancient McGuffins rather than on the moral choices of the protagonist start to lose my interest. Also rituals are almost completely fanon, especially referring to them as such. Much like calling Dumbledore "the leader of the light", it's not /wrong/ but it's not canon. There were so few rituals (one really, in the graveyard) shown that there was no need to refer to them as if they were a whole class of magical activity.

***** To be fair in regards to branches of magic, JKR doesn't exactly do a great job of defining and expanding on the various rules and classifications of magic within the books. Rituals are clearly a thing, even though we only see one in canon, much like Alchemy is a thing, even though it's really only mentioned in Philosopher's Stone. Just because JKR doesn't expand on the subjects doesn't really make them fanon (although, yeah, specific common rituals in fanfics that don't show up in canon /would/ be fanon, but I'm specifically referring to it's classification as a piece of magic). It's more likely that these subjects are outdated, too dangerous to be taught at school, or are specialized branches that would require post-NEWT studies, such as an apprenticeship.

***** I'm not sure I would agree with your idea that modernization is a major theme in the series. That isn't to say that I think glorification of the old is a major theme either; I don't really see strong progressive or regressive themes. For instance, both Dumbledore and Voldemort promise more rights to traditionally marginalized groups like werewolves, and neither of them seem to have a pronounced philosophical hardon for light or dark magic aside from personal preference.

Perhaps on a more meta level, since the founding of Hogwarts presumably served an important role in standardizing the teaching and dissemination of magical knowledge? I'm not trying to argue that within the books they glorify ancient magic. I do not believe that ever actually happens. Associations with such ideas have been absorbed into the fannon, for instance assuming that deatheaters have strong 'make wizarding britain great again' sort of leanings which presumably includes 'old magic is good magic' ideas. But that isn't ever clearly established in the books. Similarly, I don't think anyone ever suggests that newer magic is better than older magic in any real way. New things get invented, which is good because it solves problems (like wolfsbane potion) but no one seems to be really enthusiastic about invention or development of new spells. The national magical research institute is literally called The Department of Mysteries. Arithmancy is supposedly important in the creation of new spells, but its barely talked about.

If you want to talk about things we can reasonably assume about the wizarding world despite it never having screen time, then I think my earlier point still stands. New magic is likely easier to cast, easier to learn, and slightly weaker/inferior. Old magic is probably harder to learn, harder to perform (difficult potions, long incantations to spells, etc), and potentially more powerful/longer lasting etc. In terms of what most people know and cast, new spells are likely preferred. But I think it isn't unreasonable to speculate there could be older forms of magic that dedicated searchers might find and use which would suit their needs better than more modern spells. For instance, if I want to build an entire neighborhood's worth of houses, modern construction techniques are almost certainly my best bet. If I want to build myself a castle, there are lots of pointers I could take from modern architecture, but a lot of what I end up doing is going to be exactly what they did 1000 years ago, if for no other reason than no one really makes castles anymore.

I did not say this at all. I was just pushing back against this idea in fanon that ancient magic = awesome and instawin. In the setting magic is a technology, and like most technologies magic has generally gotten better with time. The main point of my replies is that fanfics overly focusing on McGuffins or ancient artifacts misses the point of Harry Potter, whether they're new or old.

New brooms, faster and better than the ones before them, come out every year. Fred and George spend years creating WWW products. Pandora Lovegood was a spell researcher, and it's never said anywhere that she worked for the Department of Mysteries. Severus Snape also invented several spells without working there. I certainly don't think magical innovation and experimentation are confined to just that one institution, and in canon it's shown that people are very excited about new discoveries and products.

It must be remembered that what inventions they do have are pretty fantastic. The floo network is akin to Star Trek transporter technology, and wizards have had them for a few centuries. People often take Arthur's lack of comprehension of muggle technology as stupidity, when I think it just underlines how truly differently wizards live. A Starfleet Vulcan explorer landing on Earth would have similar troubles. There isn't much about the muggle 90's that magic can't top IMHO. Except maybe Mariah Carey!

Which is just restating my analogy that old magic that is superior to modern magic most likely is disused because of a cost attached to it. Whether it's difficulty of learning or using the magic requires human sacrifice the concept is the same.

Anyway I think we are in violent agreement for the most part.

** The way I like to think of it is sort of similar to how technology worked in the muggle world - it wasn't a straight linear trajectory, nor even always moving forward. When civilisations fall, vast quantities of knowledge tend to be lost in the process. It took centuries to figure out how the Pyramids or Stonehenge were built. The Greeks could do shit with bronze that we still can't replicate, and nobody really knows what the /fuck/ is up with Damascus steel. That shit's got carbon nanotubes, yo!

With magic being as naturally esoteric as it is, I can only imagine it to be like that cranked up by several magnitudes. Modern wizards, by and large, can do stuff with magic that would blow the socks off of their ancient counterparts, but there's still a lot of relics and old magic that the ancients cooked up that still have modern magic's greatest experts saying “What the scrum-diddly fuck is this?”.

Hence how Voldemort can be the most powerful dark lord of all time, yet still be caught blindsided by ancient magic like blood bonds and the Deathly Hallows.

** When I've seen that idea done well in fics, it's usually that the old ways of practicing magic have more raw power but less diverse applications and/or less fine control.

For example, one of the characters in "To Play the Devil" weilds a staff and channels magic more like magicians did in old folktales, with bits of music and expending small items of minor power. In a fight his magic has great offensive force, but he doesn't have the quick versatility of a hundred spells that a wizard with a wand could cast.

I think that type of world-building makes sense from a narative standpoint. It allows for the old obscure magics to be exciting, but it still makes sense why modern methods of magic became the norm.

** Old magic being superior to new magic is an extremely common trope in fantasy. Hell, its derived in large part from mythology itself in many ways, as often old deities or humans were more powerful than the modern day equivalents in such tales. The trope has its heyday in the Tolkeinverse though, with its themes of waning magic and rising mankind in the story. It has its merits, but frankly it is more suited towards stories with mythical or supernatural powerful figures that gifted power in the past, rather than people in the past being just better.

In the Harry Potter universe, I think people misconstrue the existence of places like Hogwarts or objects like the Deathly Hallows as signs that wizards were more skilled in the past. Rather, the world indicates these are so amazing because they are /anomalies/, rather than the norm. Wizards and witches haven't grown more powerful or such, magic has not changed in and of itself. Exceptional wizards rise to the forefront in every era, same as the modern. Often their abilities are raised up to near god-like or mythical statuses overtime - this is even occurring with Dumbledore, Voldemort and Harry in the modern era.

New magic is better. Why do I say that? Well look at it this way: the main charm to lift objects that is used today is the Levitation Charm (Wingardium Leviosa). However, there exists numerous other charms that do similar if not identical work (ex. the Hover Charm, the Rocket Charm, even the Summoning Charm possibly). And yet, the main one used is Wingardium Leviosa, for the same reason Google is the dominant internet search engine: its better than the competition. Magical knowledge improves overtime by finding out what works and what does not, by looking for ways around the current weaknesses. In this manner, magic is similar to technology in that its always improving, though its the rare few who are able to truly jump the game forward.

A good fic that discusses this at one point would be linkffn(Realignment by puzzleSB).

** New magic is usually more refined and more exact.

Ancient magic has the advantage of unorthodox methods that have fallen out of favor like human sacrifice which provides massive amounts of raw power, but it's more crude than new magic.

Plus some enchantments can draw on magic from the environment which allows them to last long beyond the deaths of their creators, and if those are centuries old they hold a lot of raw power too.

New magic is precise and efficient, old magic relies on raw power to get things done.

Some very powerful spells from that were available in ancient times are forgotten because they were banned for causing too much trouble.

** My view of it is that it's a combination of survivorship bias and a cost/benefit analysis that modern wizards find completely unacceptable.

Survivorship bias as in nobody remembers the ancient spell to create light, because Lumos is better in every possible way (for one, you don't need 3 ounces of mouse blood).

Cost/benefit analysis as in "Yes, they could influence the weather across all of england, but they also killed half a dozen squibs to fuel it and risked the wizard casting it dying from the strain."

You see the cost/benefit one a lot in fics in "rituals" (or often even "runes") where it's a lot of work with some drawbacks, sometimes serious ones, to achieve something that's only marginally better than what wizards can do now. Usually the biggest benefit is that the ritual caster can do it /alone,/ or at least with one or two close confidants. Great for Harry because he has no support structure and, as a child and a student, not really given much independence to do these things with a group. Not really a problem for the wizarding world at large.

** Personally i like that magic as a whole is the same but certain techniques are taught more than others because its most easy or convenient to teach to teach it that way at the time. For example there are requires a sort of instinct if belief or emotion behind it. Like say the patronus which requires a strong enough good memory to give you conviction. Or the cruciatus where you need to want to hurt someone to use the spell effectively. Or divination which to a certain degree is a intuition you have or don't in some of its aspects.

In comparison things like say transfiguration potions and Arithmancy have specific things you need to do as long as you understand what you need to do and are precise you are able to pull it off well. This kind of magic is easier to teach to a large number of students . It is limiting as to truly understand all or magic that emotional instinctive aspect might be needed. But it might not be easy to incorporate into the current schooling system. At least not till higher studies.

The emotional and instinct based stuff is a older practice since spells were likely created they didn't naturally exist. There were no specific rules you could read up at the begining. You just had to rely on instinct and experimentation. But at the same time the importance of a particular wand movement wasnt something wizards made up there is a reason why it worked. So its not really fair to say its a newer magic. But its just magic that was discovered later.
