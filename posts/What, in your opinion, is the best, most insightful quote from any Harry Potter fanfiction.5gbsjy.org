** I found that HPMoR actually had some pretty decent quotes.

However, when combined with some other shortcomings, this had the effect of coming off as preachy, effectively turning some readers away.

** "But think about it, Ms. Weasley. Wouldn't it be nice if there were a boy hero in the world, one who rose from the ashes like Fawkes here? Wouldn't it be nice if love could protect you from the Avada Kedavra? Wouldn't it be wonderful if a boy hero appeared to give us all hope, to make us believe that we really can conquer a foe we imagine so much more powerful than we are? Wouldn't it be lovely if it were all true? And if enough people believed in it strongly enough, wouldn't that be a kind of magic in and of itself?"

** It is from HPMOR, which I know is not everyone's favourite.

I actually wrote this one up and tacked it to my office bulletin board, because it reminds me both to be and not to be a "hero"

"But she had to carry on, because that was what heroes did, they carried on, and also because it had seemed infinitely too awful to tell everyone she was calling it off. Hermione wondered how much heroism had gone on for reasons like that. Most books didn't say "And then they refused to give up, no matter how sensible it would have been, because that would've been too embarrassing"; but a great deal of history made a lot more sense that way."

Also, this quote from Where your treasure is because I've found it to be true in my life.

"It appeared to be physiologically impossible to cry and eat a chocolate biscuit at the same time, and the biscuit was so delicious that she gave crying up as a bad job."

** There's a lot, but the one that I immediately thought of (and probably not the most insightful, but the most memorable) is:

#+begin_quote
  Sirius sighed and propped his head on his hand, elbow planted on the desk. "If you befriend someone no one else likes, you don't just gain the man's friendship. You gain his soul."

  "I shouldn't think I'd like someone's soul," Harry said after a moment's consideration. "I might do something awful with it."

** "Harry there is no such thing as being evil. People label you evil for your actions. Have i done heinous things? Yes. Have i ruinned countless lives? Yes. I even enjoyed it. But you and yours made me "evil". Me? I just lived up to it." Voldemort

I love this quote because its about the concept that good and evil are labels created by the public not actual adjectives that mean anything. Voldemort here (i dont remember the fic though i believe it to be a one-shot) does not deny he did twisted things and enjoyed it. He is saying he cant be evil unless someone says he is.

*** Like [[/u/Taure]] said, this isn't a good argument. To show this, I think I'll just condense it down into a nine word quote you may or may not recognize:

#+begin_quote
  From my point of view the Jedi are evil!

**** Okay enough.

Firstly, the quote was never said to be accurate. What is good and evil morally and ethically is decided ny a culture of people. Voldemort while most would consider him evil does his followers believe the same? Probably not. It is not so much a declaration of reality and definition but a view point objective.

I enjoy the quote because it is not the cookie cutter voldemort that is like Im evil blahblah blah i do evil things! Blood purity. I get that the philosophy behind the statement is not solid but then again neither is the philosophy behind any act.
