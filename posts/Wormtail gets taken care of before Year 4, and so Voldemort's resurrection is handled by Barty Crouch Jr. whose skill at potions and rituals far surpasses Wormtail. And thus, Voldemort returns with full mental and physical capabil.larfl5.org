Harry still participates and wins in the Triwizard Tournament - however instead of the public resurrection ceremony, Crouch nicks some of his blood after he has won. Voldemort is reborn in a less public way.

After rebirth, Voldemort is less pointlessly cruel and more charismatic, the kind of person you'd expect to lead a revolution. Book 5 proceeds in a different way.

Due to Voldemort's resurrection not being public, the Ministry carries on as usual. However Fudge finds himself in sticky situations emphasizing how ineffectual he is, culminating in his impeachment.

Meanwhile, Voldemort still has ability to influence Harry with visions due to the Scarcrux, and he uses that ability ruthlessly. He plants ideas in Harry, making him believe that he himself is a genius. After Fudge's impeachment, the fact that Harry was declared of age when he participated in the Triwizard Tournament becomes public knowledge and the Boy-Who-Lived is assailed with letters filled with pleas to become the Minister of Magic, so that Wizarding Britain can rise once again. The Boy Who Lived applies for the post - and wins handily.

Dumbledore feels mild unease as he witnesses the events happening. It strangely parallels the election of 17 year old Millicent Bagnold as the Minister of Magic in 1980...


** if you like the idea of a more active, slightly mad & cunning Barty Crouch Jr., who replaces Wormtail as the right hand of Voldemort, I strongly suggest the Marauder's Plan ff. :) linkffn(Marauder's Plan)

When I read it in december , it gave me the same ecstatic feeling that the HP series had given me many years ago for the first time, and that is as great of a compliment as I can give to a HP fanfic.

** Barty Jr resurrecting Voldemort is a good idea, but why does it have be Year 4?

Based on book timeline, there was no way Barty Jr had enough time to find Voldemort and sabotage the TWT. Wormtail was only able to find Voldemort so quickly because as a rat, he overheard their conversations. Barty Jr didn't have this luxury, so it could be years before he finally found his master in a dark corner of Albanian forest!

Besides, why is everyone so infatuated with that Voldemort Resurrection Scheme in Year 4? Why can't Voldemort come back later when Harry's much older and better prepared. Then you can avoid the child soldier issue and forcing some ridiculous power progressions on Harry (and his friends). Can't we have at least some refreshing new plots?

*** Well in this particular prompt, I felt it was more about Voldemort manipulating Harry from the shadows then Barty's feat of resurrecting him. Could be an interesting story.

**** But you still need a third person, whose existence in this case would have been unknown to everyone if Wormtail didn't accidentally run into Bertha Jorkins. Harry would have to also be completely different or Voldemort really powerful as a wraith to possess Harry to enter the Triwizard Tournament. Also it's heavily implied that the rudimentary body was needed in order for the resurrection ritual to work. There are other things that are missing.

** No one else mentioned it. But the idea of voldemort putting a 17 year old in charge of the government is genius. Teenagers have no self awareness. The government would be drastically weakened as the bureaucrats started to eat each other and started a giant power grab.

  Not all wars are black and white, as Harry learns when the second war with Voldemort seems to be painted in nothing but shades of grey. In which Harry is confused, Tonks is overwhelmed, Barty is a genius, Snape hates everyone, Dumbledore is trying his best, and Voldemort is having the time of her life. fem!Voldemort
