** I won't get into whether or not this interview is good or bad or whatever, that's not my job or anything.

That being said, orthography, please pay attention to it. Stuff like mistaking the usage of your/you're has absolutely no place in anything that is supposed to be taken seriously, and by having mishaps of this sort in the text you may be causing some people to dismiss the interview purely based on that.

Edit: And of course I had to have eaten a word because irony likes us all.

*** Where did I misuse the word? I hate when I make that kind of mistake as I know the difference. Please let me know and I'll correct it. Thanks!

**** Hmm ... upon taking a quick look, it either got edited (which I wouldn't blame you for) or I was too tired and should not have been telling people about spelling.

In any case, I'll comb through it in a day since I have work ahead of me now and I don't want to be stupid twice so no attempts before getting more sleep.

Sorry about that.

*** This subreddit is a bit of an echo chamber with people promoting the same handful of fics as "the best" but I had never heard of any of those authors until I came here and never really got into them. Fanfiction is a large community and different people have different opinions. I've seen some swear up and down that DAYD is the best and others read only Dramione and promote the best of those stories. I find it amusing that you're asking others if those authors ring any bells when Not From Others is just as recommended on this subreddit. It's where I first heard about it.

*** And I haven't heard of any of the fanfic writers you listed.

Fanfiction is incredibly fragmented into categories and pairings. I don't think you can say there's a top list of most respected writers in the fanfiction world.

About the interview itself: pretty good, with some intersting discussion, although I'm getting very sick of pairing discussions.

Congrats to FloratCastellum with her mother being clean! That's wonderful to hear!

*** Well obviously this is a matter of opinion, but whenever people ask for recommendations in /hpfanfiction, her name is always mentioned. And her stories are given generally excellent reviews.

**** That's because she's active on here and has one story that is recced often (and it is phenomenal). That being said, it has less than 200 favourites and none of her other fics have more than 50. That's not one of the most respected writers.

**** Actually, depending on the wording you used, it might very well not be a matter of opinion.

When you write “respected”, it's possible for you to be writing about your own respect for her, and thus it could be taken as an opinion. When you write “one of the most respected”, however, then you are taking the opinions of others and comparing one to another, which means that need to be looking at what is individually a subjective phenomenon objectively, and thus it is not allowed to be your opinion or anyone else's but instead has to be properly looked into.

Just a lesson for the future.
