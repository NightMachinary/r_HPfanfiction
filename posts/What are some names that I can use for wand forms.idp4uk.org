So I a writing a fanfic, and I am using the idea that like a jedi, a wizard or a witch has a different or style for wand waving. So what are some great names and styles are these forms.


** So, you're not talking the motions, like swish and flick? You're talking more like martial arts styles with wing chun being more short and compact movements, and wu shu being larger, swooping movements?

In that case, you could use descriptive words such as stiff, compact, expressive, loose, flowery, and the like for styles.

You could also use the names of the people who originated the styles or were well-known for being capable in the style. These would be your character names, unless you want to borrow names from Renaissance swordsmen, like Capo Ferro.

You could also use "descriptive" words like "shadow wand," "hidden strike," or something like that.

*** As I mentioned to another comment, is that the issue I have naming the forms coincides with it either it being more offensive or more defensive. Fir example, strike of the phoniex will be dealing with being in the offensive. Very graceful movements.

** Have you ever read the Wheel of Time? In it, sword forms have things like:

- Arc of the Moon
- Cat Crosses the Courtyard (more of a general method of movement)
- Lizard in the Thornbush
- Parting the Silk
- The Viper Flicks Its Tongue

etc. You could talk that kind of approach (naturalistic) and adapt it to magic. Such as, I don't know, The Phoenix Spreads Its Wings or some such.

*** This sounds similar the I think v or vi forms for lightsabers. But I think with what you said, it should be phonies strikes, but I don't how some will be more offensive or defensive strikes.

** I don't do it too often, but I usually name them after the person who pioneered them, or the place that it originated from. Hogwarts Standard is the go to, while there could also be like the Flitwick half-grip, and it could be optimized for whatever he specialized in.
