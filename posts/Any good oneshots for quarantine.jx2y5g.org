I am currently quarantined and I was wondering if there is any good oneshots someone can recommend to me. Preferably Harmione, Lunnary, or HarryxPansy. I don't really care if there is any smut.

  "This Cinders girl is just like you!" Dudley snickers as he watches the television. "Dressed in rags, does all the chores, always dirty, and no one wants her!" Later, when Harry lies in bed and stares up at the dusty cobwebs on the cupboard ceiling, he can't help but wonder wearily: "If I'm Cinders, does that mean one day someone will come to save me too?" Oneshot. HHr.

  A short one shot in honor of Harry's fortieth birthday. In my opinion Harry's ideal birthday at that age would be extremely underwhelming to an outsider but Harry always did seem to defy the public's expectations.
