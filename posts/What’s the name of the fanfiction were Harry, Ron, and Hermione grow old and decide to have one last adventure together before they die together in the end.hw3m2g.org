:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember that this story was a one shot on FanFiction.Net were Harry, Ron, and Hermione are all old in age and I think they decide to sneak in to Gringotts and ride a dragon just for the hell of it. To have one last adventure. And then in the morning when people find the golden trio on the ground in the ministry I think holding hands in death with a smile gracing their face. This story was a one shot and I think it may have gotten an award. I remember it being on FanFiction.Net but maybe it might have been on livejournal too I'm not sure. It's been years but I'm determined to find this story.


** That's beautiful and I hope you find it.
