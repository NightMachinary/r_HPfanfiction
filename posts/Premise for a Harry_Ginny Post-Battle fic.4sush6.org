I'm not sure if there are any well-written long fics about this premise, but what if after Harry broke it off with Ginny, she decided to date someone else in her 6th year in order to further show that she was not connected to Harry in any way? Then, when the war ended and Harry wanted to get back together, which perhaps he always assumed would happen, he finds out she is still dating someone else. Then the rest of the story is about Ginny deciding who to choose and all the drama that comes with that.

I think this could be a good, realistic story. It would fit canon in that there is logic to Ginny dating someone else to give the appearance that she has no more connection to Harry, thus protecting her from the Carrows and Snape. But then she actually develops feelings for whoever she dates. And then Harry wins and comes back into her life. What does she do?

I'd love to know if there are any stories that have that premise. If not, if anyone wants to tackle it, that'd be great. I'm not a writer so it won't be me :)


** "there is logic to Ginny dating someone else to give the appearance that she has no more connection to Harry"

Where's the logic in that? She's a Weasley, and that is more than enough reason for the Carrows to go after her, and she was in the DA, and went with Harry to the DoM...

*** There is a difference between being a target in general and being a target to get at somebody else.

I think Sirius's case is the closest analogue here. Sirius would have been a target anyway, with he being who he was. But Sirius was targeted in particular for getting to Harry after Kreacher revealed how close they were. Sirius wouldn't have died had he not been singled out by Voldemort for being close to Harry.

*** Harry broke up with her to protect her right? There needed to at least be the perception that connections between her and Harry had been severed, to the point where using her to get to Harry would not have worked. If Harry started dating someone else, it would lend credibility to the perception.

Now I'd probably agree that there is enough past connection where Harry and Ginny not being together would not stop the Death Eaters from going after her. I myself believe that harry's reasoning for breaking up with her was faulty. But within the context of the reason Harry gave to Ginny (of which she agreed with) this logically would make sense.

**** You underestimate Ginny.

She was a good actor and adapt at lying, as shown in OoTP. She could perfectly play up the role of a jilted girlfriend, even cursing Harry and Hermione a little bit just to makes things look more credible.

Then on the Christmas Eve, Voldemort watched with his own eyes as Harry and Hermione disapparated away. A few days later, Death Eaters Travers and Selwyn again watched Harry and Hermione escaping right under their noses. For the Death Eaters, it became pretty obvious that Harry and Hermione were together, and Weasleys were not part of them.

***** Listen, I'm not saying it was ever likely Ginny would date someone else. Everything you said I agree with. All I'm saying, and I hope I'm clear here, is that such a story would be interesting, and the basic premise is not so far fetched as to render any such story unreadable. There are many fics out there that, while well-written, I just can't get into because the premise itself is just so out there.

That would be way too OOC for Ginny, who was loyal to a fault with respect to Harry.

As for protecting her from the Carrows, I hardly think it was necessary. She had dated Harry for only a few weeks, and once she passed the interrogation during the wedding night attack, she would have been cleared by the time school started. Even if Snape knew about their true relationship, don't you think Snape also had incentives to cover things up?

Speaking of Snape, it was obvious from the name 'Albus Severus Potter' that Ginny owed him several favors, in hind sight. The sword incident was the only known one, but there should have been other occasions in which Snape bailed her out of tight spots.

*** I generally agree it would be OOC. But again, if it was part of a plan to show distance, it would make more sense. Also, remember her comment to Harry about dating a Veela. It was said in jest, but I do think a part of her thought that Harry very well might be moving on from her and find himself dating someone else. She could decide, in an effort to both protect herself and her family, and to better deal with the year in front of her, to date someone else, if only as a distraction.

I agree Snape was never actually a threat, but Ginny did not know that. My point about it being logical was not to say its logical from the reader's perspective, but from her perspective with the limited information she had.

I think, within canon, Ginny never bought Harry's argument that as long as people thought they were together, she would be at risk. If she did, she never would have pulled those stunts she pulled like stealing the sword. She rightly assumed that if the Death Eaters were going to come after her, it would be as much about her being a blood traitor as anything else.

Perhaps putting separation between herself and Harry was more about protecting Harry than herself. Harry thought they might use Ginny to get to Harry. So to keep Harry focused on his task, they had to break up. My point is there is logic then for having Ginny date someone else, to further solidify the fact that they couldn't use Ginny to get to Harry.
