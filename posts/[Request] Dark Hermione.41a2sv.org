I was wondering if there are any good dark!Hermione (or even evil) out there where she is powerful and won't be paired up with /all the super handsome and dashing moody characters who are secretly totaly awesome and misunderstood/ ? (I'm meaning no Draco, Snape, Voldemort etc.)


** Linkffn(applied cultural anthropology) is what you want to a t. Not complete, but it does get updates, although not as often as I'd like.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

  Hermione is a sister to Harry, a mother to Rose and Hugo, a wife to Ron, and a Legilimens and Unspeakable. She is also very, very angry. A look at a Hermione who developed the instincts she evidenced with Marietta Egdecombe and Dolores Umbridge. AU, though canon compliant. *Drama/horror. COMPLETE.*

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.

  Hermione and Draco team up after the war to overthrow the Order and take over wizarding Britain. "I don't even especially mind belonging to you most of the time," he closes his eyes and just breathes for a bit, savoring not being in pain. Finally he adds, "Just... try to take better care of your toys." Dark Dramione. COMPLETE

** - An off-FF.net classic is [[http://grangerenchanted.com/enchant/viewstory.php?sid=1819][Dangerous]], probably abandoned, but what's written is very good.

- linkffn(The Two-Body Problem by tozette) seems to be going in that general direction.

- linkffn(Darkest Witch of Her Age by darkrose0510) is a bit emo and is probably abandoned, but she's more likely to Crucio Draco than to kiss him. (In fact, she does just that.) Her fall from grace might be a bit insufficiently motivated.

  Modern AU - Primarily Tomione but other pairings will happen (het/slash) - Hermione's just a small town girl, livin' in a lonely world. She took the midnight plane on a journey to LA in order to pursue her dream. What could possibly go wrong? - Not quite a crack!fic. Un-beta'd and rated M for sexual references, situations, and a lot of language. An a cappella story of aca-love.

** Almost forgot: this one is off AO3: linkao3(682335): an Antichrist-like Hermione takes over the world. It's more of a drabble than a full-on narrative, and YMMV, but it's clever, and it has this amazing line: [[/spoiler][It was so blindingly obvious, in retrospect, that it stunned her that she had not seen it immediately after the final demise of Voldemort. What had Dumbledore left them? Ronald had been given an indulgence to save him from his own misguided behavior, Harry had been given a relic to encourage his martyrdom, and she - she had been given Dumbledore's own youthful inspiration. Clearly, he had meant her to succeed where he had failed. Clearly.]]

  When she was young and naive, she thought that nothing could justify slavery and the end of liberation justified any means.

  Like all children, however, she grew up, and put aside childish naivete; she came to realize that slavery was not such a bad thing - that slaves did not desire freedom, but a kind master.
