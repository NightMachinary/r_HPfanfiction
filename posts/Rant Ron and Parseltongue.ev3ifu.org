It is completely ludicrous that Ron "learns" Parseltongue from Harry talking in his sleep. *You cannot learn a language by listening to it with NO CONTEXT!* You can listen to Russian audiobooks for years and not learn the language, because it's only noise until somebody teaches you that THIS noise means THAT object. Or perhaps Chinese is a better example because it's a tonal language.

With access to a pensieve, he theoretically could have watched the memory from second year enough times to mimic the command to open (because it has context), but there's no way he could pick out the four syllables and proper intonation of the "Open" command from the few-and-far-apart times he'd heard it (Chamber of Secrets and the locket horcrux).

So, the question becomes: was Ron possessed by a horcrux? That's how Ginny was able to speak Parseltongue.


** Ron didn't learn Parseltongue from Harry talking in his sleep, that was only in the movies.

In the Books Ron imitated what Harry said to open Slytherin's locket(the only thing Harry said in Parseltongue was 'open') and he still needed quite a few tries, it was made pretty clear that Ron didn't really learn how to speak Parseltongue.

** That's movie only. In the books he kinda just tries to imitate Harry until he gets it right. Not that that's really any more feasible cuz I don't think the human mouth can actually accurately imitate a snake without magic but that's a separate can of worms.

** The simplest explanation is that whatever magic was in charge of verifying the password had very wide tolerances, so anything even vaguely correct would work. Beyond that, what's wrong with just plain old luck and destiny? Harry's had a large number of highly improbable events happen to help him defeat Voldemort. Why can't Ron have a few?

** There's actually a fan fiction based on this (the name of which I can't remember; anyone know?). The plotline starts with Ron using parseltongue to open the chamber entrance during the battle of Hogwarts, and Hermione realizes he's a dark wizard because of it. It's one of those Ron/Dumbles bashing, HarryXHermione, time travel fics.

It's not that hard to imitate words from other languages when you don't know how to speak them.

*** Yes, it is, because you have to know what the word IS. He only heard the word "open" a few times, and it's not like he was paying strict attention at the time because there was all this other stress happening. He would have been standing there making random hissing noises.

**** Have you never had to learn a song in another language back in your school days? I know that in primary school (where the official language was English) we were taught several songs in different languages. I can still sing the first verse and chorus of that Alouette song, even though I don't know what the hell any of it means.

You can however imitate something you hear, and from what the books said, it took Ron quite a few tries to imiate it correctly. Doesn't mean he actually knows Parsletongue now though.

** My headcanon is Occam's Razor: Ron was a parselmouth and hid it. Mimicing Parseltongue is so hard to mechanically explain and too "ass-pully" for my tastes.

Don't forget there was two doors he had to open, and the first door requiring being opened again to leave. So three doors. The odds of him "mimicking" parseltongue three times in only a "few" tries is so far out there that the whole thing isn't very likely. Why would he hide it? He grew up being indoctrinated that Slytherins bad. Snakes bad. Dark magic bad. And then he saw how Harry was treated in Year2.
