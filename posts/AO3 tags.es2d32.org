What are some of your favorite tags to search for HP fanfics on AO3? I can't go through them all, but have a couple favorite tags throughout various fandoms I'll favorite to scroll through occasionally. What tags usually gives good fics, and a decent number of them? I'm willing to read just about anything, quite literally, so nothing needs to be excluded for that.

EDIT: I do understand the various ways I can sort/exclude/filter the fanfics. I just have read a lot of HP fanfic, and was looking for ways/tags to come across fics I maybe haven't seen yet. Also, thanks those of your who rec'd tags!


** I tend to sort by Bookmarks, Kudos, Comments and Hits. I exclude what I don't want but I find that most tags aren't universal enough so I exclude instead of include mostly

*** I find that sorting by hits or kudos gets mostly pure Explit smut. If that isn't your fancy, do you exclude Explicit rated fics?

** I don't do blind tag searches. When I read a story that I really like, I check out the tags for that story and click on the one(s) for the aspect(s) that I really enjoyed about it. That typically leads me on a "free association" trail (just like old-school web surfing) of tags that may or may not have anything to do with one another.

That said, try "The Author Regrets Nothing" for a fun ride.

** I usually just look for ships and then check crossovers/no crossovers depends on what you want and start reading. If you want something happy look for "fluff" I'm also fond of "angst with happy end" but normally i don't really do tags.

I mostly use them to exclude stuff, like oc's genderswap etc. You get the hang of what you want eventually but it's always good to look for tropes you are into.

Personally I like "Master of Death Harry" and "Time Travel" You can also look for a lot of other tropes or exclude the ones you dislike. "Wrong boy who lived" or "Harry is a Slytherin" "Dark Harry" "Mentor Snape" are some popular rropes i think. "Creature Harry Potter" or "Creature fic" is also cool. You can also explicitly search for "Werewolves" or "Vampires" or whatever you want

If you don't want anything graphic exclude "Porn what Plot" "Graphic Violence" "Rape/Non-con" maybe "dubious consent" "sex"

I personally never sort by hits or kudos or comments otherwise you don't get to see the new fics. I also tend to mostly browse through completed fics which is a checkbox you can click. You can also sort by rating and relationships. You can also exclude certain ships and decide if you only want M/M relationship fics or F/F or F/M or other
