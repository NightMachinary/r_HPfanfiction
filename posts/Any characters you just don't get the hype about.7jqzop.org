For me, I think it's Dobby. I don't really find him interesting at all, and I'm always surprised at how upset people get that I killed him off in my AU, or when people mention him as their favourite character. I thought he was sound and all, just didn't see him as CRUCIAL or anything.

*** Canon Tonks sucks, at least in HBP and DH. There, I said it. Her husband was an utter dick, wallowing in self pity and running away from responsibility, which would have gotten him divorced in real life. Her death only served the "history repeats itself" trope. But early OotP is where she "shines". Everyone is tense due to Voldemort, Molly is her annoying self and then you have the only adult witch, who is not a Weasley, walking around seemingly without giving a fuck with pink hair, daring to bark at Moody and trying to lighten the mood. She is the only woman who starts as a badass, everyone else did not. Molly ignored child abuse, Ginny almost got everyone in Hogwarts killed, Hermione was annoying and Fleur almost became Dragon BBQ. But Tonks is this playful young woman who already got through Auror training, making her the only female Auror we ever get to know IIRC. She was the victim of Rowling's strange delusions about epic love stories that actually are unhealthy relationships.

And Tonks in fanficton is interesting. Outside of smut you rarely find the same characterisation for her. Compared to Daphne, Hermione or Ginny that makes her stand out.

There are some good short-stories and quite a few fics with good Tonks characterisations (Rune Stone Path, Old Friends, New Friends). Summer of change and the retransmuted series are some classics that didn't age well because they had tropes that became overused over the years.

I think if I'm to read a Tonks-focused story, then the main trio should not be major characters. If Tonks is just a side character, then I don't mind the presence of the trio, but any relationships would just feel awkward.

He was a shitty, cowardly husband, who spat on his friendship with the Potters by staying out of Harry's life and is an overall boring character. Turning him into the good guys is just whitewashing but for Tonks the options seem to be limited to either him or Charlie Weasley. So no Tonks stories for me -. -

********* I'm open for no romance as well but good stories are hard to find, especially without pairings since relationships are a fundamental part of our nature.

As for Remus, he ran away from his pregnant wife. There's no excuse for that, especially since broken thrust is hard to heal. He completely ignored Harry, the son of his best friend, his honorary brother. Harry was in desperate need of help, suffering child abuse for over a decade and running into situations no child should experience, and yet he did nothing. Sirius Black, despite facing summary execution, did far more for Harry than Lupin. His anti dementor lessons were also horrible, exposing Harry to the boggart despite him not being able to cast the spell. And the boggart lesson went against every pedagogic method known.

I'm not saying that Lupin is worse than Voldemort but his personal failings are massive and almost always whitewashed or justfied with a sob-story.

*** I agree. Snape was not a tragic character, he was a man who joined the magical Waffen-SS AFTER driving his best friend away with his ideology. He only "turned" when the same friend, now married woman he was lusting after, was threatened and even then only wanted to save her, not her husband and child. He maybe even hoped to profit from her family getting torn apart. He then spent the next decade being an absolute dick and dooming an entire generation by keeping people from going into health care and civil service. Snape proceeded to be an arse to his love's son, try to get an innocent man executed, helped with child endangerment (Protection of the Stone). While being a double agent for a illegitimate paramilitary group he covered Death Eater Crimes.

Because his motivation was love for a married woman who perished fifteen years ago due his actions, which has to be a very strange kind of necrophilia, he was declared a hero in the end. How? His only good action was delivering a magical sword, which honestly could have been hidden somewhere by Dumbledore or delivered by phoenix. Talking a teenager (=child soldier) into taking a killing curse for the team does not count as good act. There was no reason for him to die.

**** I think you're exaggerating slightly, especially of the "dooming an entire generation by keeping people from going into health care and civil service." Yes, he only wanted to take NEWT students who were O-level, but if we judge by Harry's sixth year there were ten students who had managed to get top marks in Potions. (Four Slytherins including Malfoy, four Ravenclaws, Ernie Macmillan from Hufflepuff and of course Hermione.) If we assume this is an average number of top students, that's still ten per year. And Snape taught Potions for fourteen years, so that should make it... a hundred and forty people with the necessary schooling to join the Aurors or become Healers. That is if Healers even need NEWT-level Potions; far as I know the books never say.

You're right that Snape was a small-minded, petty man who by all acounts was a horrible person... but I'd argue that this is a big part of WHY he was a tragic character. If he'd been noble and heroic and good, his death would have been tragic. As it was, the tragedy was the person he'd let himself become. Or that's my take on him, anyway.

This is not in the series I read. Or rather, it's a personal black-and-white morality version of a semi-redemptive narrative arc. Snape loved Lily long before she married; it wasn't "his love for a married woman," it was his love for someone he'd known since he was nine. Lily doesn't cease to be her own person, a person worthy of love, simply because she got married. Their friendship ended /before/ she changed her mind about James and long before Lily and James married. All the evidence supports the fact that, after the conversation outside the Gryffindor common room, Snape complied with Lily's wishes and left her alone. It wasn't a sudden lust for a married woman that compelled him, and it wasn't a desire to "have" Lily. The fact that he still loved her - and love isn't only about wanting to fuck her, as so many Snape-haters imply; Snape clearly idealized her, which is a problem in itself, but he loved the person who had been his friend growing up - the fact that he loved her is /a good thing./ He wasn't stalking her, bothering her, or interfering with her marriage. He only breaks his silence about Lily to beg Dumbledore to save her life.

Also, he didn't know who the prophecy pointed to. That doesn't absolve him of his indifference to the fact that someone, somewhere was going to become a target for murder; he obviously didn't care about that, which is the low point from which he has to struggle upward to the understanding that other people's lives matter. If this had been a book about Snape, we would have seen more of that struggle. As it is, by the time we get to the line "Lately, only those whom I could not save," it's right there on the page that Snape finally gives a fuck and has actually made attempts to save people who are not Lily. Hate him as much as you like, but in fiction this is considered moral growth and is part of his redemption arc.

And the whole point of "Talking a teenager (=child soldier) into taking a killing curse for the team" is a very curious reinterpretation of that particular plot point. That was entirely Dumbledore's scheme, and Snape actually has one morally transcendent moment when he recognizes how horrible it is and is shocked by Dumbledore's manipulation and apparent cynicism. He goes along with it because, by that point, he's not /only/ doing this for Lily. He clearly understands that defeating Voldemort is the thing that must happen at all costs, even if that cost includes his own death. If you hate that plot point so much, blame Dumbledore and JKR. It's pretty apparent that Dumbledore assumed Voldemort would live on and find a way to possess Harry - or kill Harry and possess his body - if the horcrux wasn't destroyed. It's never simply stated in the books, but the whole motivating force for the complicated shenanigans around Harry not dying (or Harry returning from death) involves the extreme danger of even one horcrux remaining in the world - a danger compelling enough to "excuse" the potential sacrifice of a 17-year-old boy.

You're transposing a fantastical world with a convoluted salvation narrative (Harry's, not Snape's) into the real world and judging everyone based on that. Which warps the story beyond the framework the author obviously intends. I mean, feel free to do that. But it makes your summary sound like a weird literal-minded parody of HP and makes me wonder what in the world you find to /like/ in the series at all.

  Snape said nothing, but merely looked up at Dumbledore.

  “Hide them all, then,” he croaked. “Keep her --- them --- safe. Please.”

  “And what will you give me in return, Severus?”

** I don't get why people love Sirius Black so much. I'm sympathetic to his conviction without a trial and wrongful imprisonment backstory, but nothing about how his character, as portrayed in Goblet and Phoenix, seemed at all endearing to me. Most fic writers seem to gloss over, forget about, or use his imprisonment as an excuse for his negative character traits and paint him as a fun ladies man (after they make sure that he gets out of Azkaban and gets pardoned as soon as possible, whether it helps move the plot of their fic along or not).

I also don't get the love for Draco. Throughout cannon Draco is the biggest bully in Harry's year, he's basically a slightly smarter, skinny, version of Dudley. He's lucky that Harry can't let anyone die in front of him without trying to help them, and that Narcissa lied to Voldemort's face. He wouldn't be a free citizen, or alive, in the epilogue if it wasn't for those two decisions.

It also boggles my mind how many hoops people are willing to jump through in order to paint him as a good person in their fics, or pair him up with Hermione or Harry romantically. I'm sorry, it's like I'm a HP/GW shipper (technically I am, but this is an apt metaphor for my feelings on this ) and HP/DM and HP/HG are my Harmonians.

I...I just can't, with all the fics tagged DM/HP and DM/HG that I have to scroll passed in order to find something to read. Every time I find a promising fic summery I curse Draco's existence as soon as I see DM/HP or DM/HG at the end of it. It's even worse to find a fic that I'm liking, then suddenly, DM/HP or DM/HG pops up out of nowhere (whether it's in the background or foreground) and I just can't continue reading it.

Seriously though, if there wasn't so much fan love for Draco, I wouldn't hate him so much. He would just get the pity that I felt for him while reading cannon.

If Harry accomplished some of the things fanon!Hermione does, it would feel even cheaper than it already does.

Even so, I love Hermione. I figure the authors that make her a huge Mary Sue or otherwise one dimensional would do that to whatever character they picked; it just happens to be Hermione because she's the easiest.

***** Yeah, I actually like Hermione a lot, which is why the wish fulfilment with her is so creepy - just because her flaws, such as her stubborness, her lacking sensitivity, et cetera, actually make her more interesting as a person. Especially given the fanon so often attacks Ron for the same flaws.

****** Tangentially related wall of text below, for no other reason than I've been thinking about it for character arc within a story:

Hermione's desire for authority figures is one of her most interesting traits that could be (but doesn't have to be) interpreted as flaw.

In canon, she obviously starts with McGonagall since it's likely that McGonagall introduced her to magic and then became her Head of House. Combined with her guidance of the first years through the sorting and her aura of general competence and rule following, it makes sense.

Over time, I think McGonagall lets Hermione down. Hermione perceives (perhaps erroneously) that she ignored the threat to the stone, is powerless against the basilisk, and continues to be a non player in keeping her and her friends safe.

Hermione's attention then shifts to the next natural place, Dumbledore. Through the middle books Hermione consistently has the opinion that Dumbledore will know everything, can fix everything, and that everything he does is correct and for good reasons. It frustrates Harry and Ron because they don't understand her basic need for authority to be her guidance and safety net.

Then, particularly after Dumbledore's death, her ultimate authority shifts to Harry. Canon!Harry would probably argue with me, but no matter how intelligent, resourceful, and bossy Hermione gets, she's dedicated to making what Harry wants happen. Her character has matured and she's not afraid to stand up to her authority figure, but ultimately she needs him because when she /doesn't/ have the answer, he keeps her from a downward emotional spiral.

Perhaps this is why I find Harmony so disconcerting. Not that Harry and Hermione wouldn't work, but I feel like Hermione would be happier with someone who can deflect her intensity with simplicity and humor while leaving Harry to be her authority. Ultimately this is why I like her with Ron. After Deathly Hallows, he's the most likely person to understand her relationship with Harry and be comfortable with it.

Anyway, not sure why any of this is relevant but I started thinking and writing and here we are.

A trusted authority also provides a way to admit she's wrong without losing confidence, which helps with her stubbornness.

***** I'm not so sure. While it's true that intelligence and study are key to being a powerful wizard within the HP universe, the top tier wizards all have a "secret ingredient" element which elevates them to that level. It's hard to define but nonetheless I think most readers know it when they see it - a kind of combination of instinct, character, force of will... the ability to turn everything up to 11 when the situation calls for it.

What prevents Harry from being a great wizard is the study/academic elements, but he seems to have that "secret ingredient" which can't be taught.

Hermione, on the other hand, has the study/intelligence side of things, but lacks that element of true magicalness about her.

For me it's easier to imagine Harry being more studious than it is to imagine Hermione as fundamentally more magical in her ways of thinking and viewing the world.

Hermione grew up in an upper middle class family as an only child with loving and supportive parents, pretty close to an ideal environment. Canon Hermione is peak Hermione, which is a notch or two below the truly great wizards like Dumbledore.

While the Dursley's abuse in fanfiction is often overblown, Harry clearly did not grow up in anything close to an ideal environment, which is why I find a more skilled Harry perfectly believable in AU's that change his childhood (such as The Santi's fic). Even small changes that cause the Dursleys to treat him better could believably have a large impact on his potential.

That said, most OP!Hermione characters I've read don't need intangibles because she can't be wrong and in the unimaginable case she is, she's got some ridiculous invented spell to save the day. She (and whoever she happens to be friends with) don't really struggle. Writers who write powerful characters that still struggle believably are pretty rare.

*** I agree that fanon!Luna drives me absolutely bonkers most of the time, but there is one snippet of Deathly Hallows that makes canon!Luna interesting to me.

#+begin_quote
  After a while, exhausted and drained, Harry found himself sitting on a bench beside Luna.

  “I'd want some peace and quiet, if it were me,” she said.

  “I'd love some,” he replied.

  “I'll distract them all,” she said. “Use your Cloak.”

  And before he could say a word she had cried, “Oooh, look, a Blibbering Humdinger!” and pointed out of the window. Everyone who heard looked around, and Harry slid the Cloak up over himself, and got to his feet.

  Now he could move through the Hall without interference.
#+end_quote

That snippet says so much about what Luna's grasp on reality, and most importantly, her grasp on how other people see her.

In my headcanon, Luna came to Hogwarts with a tenuous grasp on reality due to her mother's death and her father's eccentricity, as well as a lack of people her own age to connect with. Her friendship with Ginny, her inclusion in the DA, and then the resulting friendships from that gave her something to stand on.

However, those things happened when she'd already gone through a lot of her formative years. Rather than change her personality entirely, Luna still finds comfort in her imaginary creatures and allows her weirdness to remain a wall between herself and others. Those willing to see through the weirdness (her protection against bullying) will find a Ravenclaw mind and a Gryffindor heart underneath.

Thus, we arrive at a Luna that mostly knows how others see her and manipulates that to her own and her friends' advantage. I imagine her adult life being a fusion of Slughorn's party and the Ravenclaw common room door. The Rotfang conspiracy at once amused Harry enough to get him to snort mead, distracted multiple Hogwarts professors, and said something eerily accurate about how the Ministry is being infiltrated by dark wizards. I don't think it's an accident that we see this side of Luna directly after Harry lit her up with happiness with the invitation.

**** And then there are people who makes them out as those unscrupulous bullies that everyone secretly hated all along. They were probably arrogant prats, sure, but I'm pretty sure that Lily exaggarated, and that they weren't by any means worse than Fred and George, whose practical jokes may have gone too far at times, but mostly they just loved to put on a show.

They're probably those class clowns that most people just forgot about after school. And they probably weren't widely known as The Marauders in-universe; the twins wouldn't have known of them if it weren't for the map. (In canon, only Ron referred to MWPP as such in book 6.)

Snape, who often get glorified whenever they were vilified, never hesitated to use the M-word to any muggleborn but Lily, and called what future Death Eater Mulciber did to Mary Macdonald - actual bullying (or something worse) by the sound of it -, 'an innocent prank' without any hint of sarcasm. I.e. he isn't exaclty a good source of what counts as bullying and what doesn't, and he's like 90% of our canonical source from that era.

The only one of them I like is Sirius, though. The werewolf incident coincides pretty well with his escape from home, so he probably wasn't by his right mind at the time (maybe some DE-related pressure from family), something that Snape probably used to get the secret of the willow out of him. James is just a dick who probably had to grow up really fast, Remus is like a male Hermione just without any of her zeal and Peter... he's like bashfic!tag-along!Ron.

  Well, of course, Snape tried it --- *if he'd got as far as this house, he'd have met a fully grown werewolf* --- but your father, who'd heard what Sirius had done, went after Snape and pulled him back, at great risk to his life ... *Snape glimpsed me, though, at the end of the tunnel.* He was forbidden by Dumbledore to tell anybody, but from that time on he knew what I was. ...”
#+end_quote

nothing in the passage suggests that james ever got close enough to manhandle remus, or snape to be in any actual danger, or him frozen in fear. just that he pulled him back before snape got to the end of the tunnel...which snape could have easily done himself. james being there at all seems pretty unnecessary.

how i likely think it happened:

snape is going down the tunnel, at the exact same moment he sees remus, says 'what the fuck', james says 'get out of there, you git' and pulls him back. lily wasn't there, and just repeats what she's told, and you can justify snape being too flustered by the incident/it happening to quickly for him to refute it, just focusing on the narrative that was already established

though, to be honest, the whole incident is poorly written

** Ginny, only when it comes to Harry/Ginny though. I cannot stand the whole Oedipus complex thing. I remember thinking when I was like 10 how creepy that was and I still hold that view. (No offense to anyone who likes this pairing! I certainly read worse, but nothing seems to bother me as much as this.)

I much prefer Ginny as a surrogate sister for Harry, but hey, that's just me.

*** Well... if you say Ginny's not a good romatic match for Harry or their romance wasn't very well-written, I can see that... but I'd argue that there's no Oedipus complex involved. There's never been any moment in any canon where Ginny was compared to Lily, or where Harry saw his mother in her.

Yes, both Ginny and Lily had red hair and were talented with magic, but that's pretty much it. Even from what little we get to see of Lily, they were really different people.

**** Here's my problem: Harry looks like his father and ginny kinda looks like his mother. That always, always bothered me and it was definitely deliberate on JK's part. I dunno, it just always bothered me. Maybe Oedipus Complex is the wrong word, but the similarity to Harry's dead parents always turned me off to the pairing /shrugs/ No hate if you like the pairing though, it's just always bothered me. Doesn't mean it's a logical reason tho haha

*** Name one instance in the Books that compares Ginny with Lily.

You seem to assume that if two women have red hairs, they must be similar in every other aspects. Do you make the same assumption for women with blonde or black hairs?

**** Not at all, but Harry is said to look just like his father and Ginny has red hair, like his mother: it was a deliberate choice of JKs to do this and undeniably there is a similarity there. It's just something that I have always really disliked /shrugs/

***** Lily is said to have "dark red" hair at least twice in the books, along with green eyes, while Ginny is described more as a ginger, along with brown eyes, and is implied to have freckles. It is also repeatedly emphasized in the books that Ginny in terms of height is rather small, while that has not happened with regards to Lily.

***** Maybe you live in a place where red haired people are very rare?

You obviously don't have the same issue if Lily and Ginny have blonde or black hairs.

Well, In Britain, as many as [[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/maps-and-graphics/country-with-the-most-redheads-gingers/][10% of the population]] can have red hairs.

BTW, Dumbledore and Susan Bones are two more known redheads in the story.

****** Well, my own mother has red hair. Maybe that has something to do with it... Idk lol, I know it doesn't really make sense but it just has always bothered me.

But it is true that other than my mother I don't know any other people with red hair( at least while I was growing up). Maybe I just automatically associate that with her, and thus the dislike of Harry/Ginny is born. RIP tho because it is such a popular pairing

** Fred & George.

They seem to have been put on the same pedestal that Luna has been put on. That and the fact that they're always written the exact same in pretty much every fic I've read that had them as major characters really kind of bores me.

There does seem to be an overall love of pranksters/pranking in fanfiction, so I might not be getting it or something.

** Not any character in particular but just the general obsessions and/or hate towards a pairing or character in fandoms in general. I don't get why people love Olicity (from CW Arrow) so much they send send /death threats/ to the actors and their families.

Oh you love Hinny? Good for you. You hate Hinny? Congratulations. It doesn't mean that there aren't any good stories where Harry ends up with someone else, if anyone.

** Sirius Black....I just don't understand it. I didn't like him in the books, I thought he was a terrible influence and not actually very nice.

I get /logic/ of the whole he loved Harry, wanted to provide him a home, was his godfather...but I still don't get why he is so hyped up.

** Hermione. Don't get me wrong I like her character well enough, but I don't know. I've never been fascinated by Hermione, canon or fanon Hermione. There are admittedly some well done stories with Hermione, but overall I just kind of find her to be a bit much. I don't hate her or anything, I do like her character, but I highly doubt she's in my top 5 favorite characters.
