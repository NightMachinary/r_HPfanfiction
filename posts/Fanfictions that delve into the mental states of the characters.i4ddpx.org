I will always applaud authors who delve into the mental states of characters ( even though sometimes I don't like reading them because I like keeping things light lol) , there's so much to use I mean, hermione's insecurities and possible inferiority complex which pushes her to try and be the best at whatever she's doing coupled with her tendency for violence and viciousness and the bullying she most likely experienced before hogwarts, that is a good story right there.

Ron as well, come on, his feelings of worthlessness because of all his siblings, living in a household that couldn't afford the best of things, feeling the need to compare himself to others and his jealousy towards Harry because he felt overshadowed? Another great story

Oh and Harry? Do I even need to explain? Being ABUSED by the only people you call family, being bullied in school and finding out you're destined to defeat this evil villain, being thrown into different dangerous situations every year and having your godfather and mentor die on you? Another amazing story showing the mind of his character

To avoid this being too long just literally any story about the slytherin house and the pressure on them to be up to the pure blood standard and the pressure on some of them to join the DE

This is just me giving my thoughts and appreciating the authors who deep dive into the heads of our beloved characters ( even if you're an author who doesn't psychoanalyse them I appreciate you too, it can be triggering for some and others just may not know how to write it)
