This was one of the first fanfictions I read, around 18 months ago. I know for sure the vampire was Neville's relative and got close to him. The vampire I think trained him for a bit, then decided to kill him to use his body as his own.

I'm not sure of the other details, so any fics that have anything like that are appreciated. I'm not sure how well written it was, but I just remember it from a while ago.

*** Thank you so much! One of the worst parts about having read so many fics is they begin to blend together. The mobile FFN app has no good way of organizing them either :/

*** I would contest the romance in it is about as compelling as the original books.
