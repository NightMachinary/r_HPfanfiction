My favourite Fleur/Harry fic, Across The Time, was updated to its 55th chapter on Saturday. I only just found the email but when I click the link the story cannot be found? I checked Izwan's profile and the fanfic isn't on it. Does anyone know what happened? Update: I sent Izwan a PM and he got back to me fairly quickly. The story has been temporarily removed


** They do still seem to be active, as they made an update 16 hours ago to another fic. Their profile bio still says its an active project. You might have to PM them, though.
