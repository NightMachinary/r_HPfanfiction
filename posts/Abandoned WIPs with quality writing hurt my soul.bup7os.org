** That's why I refuse to read WIPs anymore. (Sorry to any fantastic authors who post WIPs, I get why, but I'll wait til you're finished until I read.)

Occasionally you'll get a fic that isn't finished but the author marked it as finished just because "well I'm not going to update it anymore" and that's even /more/ frustrating :)

** It's the cycle of fandom.

You discover a new, young writer who isn't amazing but shows potential: you stick with the bad writing and cliches for the interesting ideas underneath and the slowly developing ability to characterise. As you keep reading and following, they improve in leaps and bounds! Soon, their writing is legitimately good, and you want to tell everyone, but! The updates start to slow down. Life starts to take over, as they grow up and take on responsibilities. Also, they've lost the unselfconscious flow they used to have, as they now know enough to judge themselves.

Finally, they go on to use their fandom-honed writing skills to make some actual money, out in the real world, and you can't begrudge them it, really. But they leave their old account behind. Maybe, if you're very unlucky, they delete it all as old-shame or so they can rework it as original fic.

Unless you're finding fully-grown authors who've started late and write entirely as a hobby around their already established (and stable) lives, this is just how it always has to go.

** As someone who reads fics from multiple fandoms, including some miniscule, fairly inactive ones, a dead, quality WIP is the absolute worst. At least with the big fandoms there's a chance that someone somewhere will right something good enough to scratch that itch. With small fandoms, someone might not even write a similar idea, let alone finding a fic with quality writing over 5k words. And then the fandoms that require in-depth technical knowledge and genuine passion about the subject, not just the characters, and suddenly you have maybe 10 fics that are good that aren't about romance.

That's how I'd describe my current feelings towards the Hikaru no Go fandom. Maybe about 3k, 4k at best fics in existence, most of them no longer than 3k words, with the vast majority of them romance, particularly slash, which I'm not very into. I'd rather read about the main focus of the manga, which is Go, and barely anyone writes that. And of those who do, hardly anyone knows anything about the game. It's frustrating.

** It's never bothered me that much - for me, it's all about how much /content/ a fic has, not whether it has an ending or not. It's not even about length, given the tendency of fanfic authors to write lots of filler which is copy/pasted from other fanfics (e.g. the indy!Harry Gringotts routine, the Sirius Black trial routine, the OTT abused Harry rescued from the Dursleys routine).

It's entirely possible for a 20k word abandoned WIP to have more /content/ than a 200k word completed fic.

At its root, this comes back to the fact that I view fanfiction as a sandbox more than anything else. I read fics to see interesting and novel ideas which I can then discuss with other fans rather than stories /per se/. The original books will always be the "true story" of the HP world.

This is basically how I feel about /esama/, fics rarely go over 30k words but it's almost always unique content or at the very least not just a vague rehash of every other story.

** Yeah, it's frustrating. Especially if the author did something to make you think that it is a complete story - i.e. you find a fic marked as complete, and then it goes to some point (i.e. end of year 2 of Hogwarts), author says he will continue in another fic... and there's been no continuation whatsoever even though it's been like 3 years since that announcment.

Or if you find a fairly new one, with only a chapter or two, read it, and then there it falls silent forever. Especially when it's posted on some forum and not ffnet - some discussions up the page-count really hard only for you to find there is like 15k words worth of content.

** Nope! I just rationalize that if it was a good story, they end up overcoming their problems and defeating Voldemort or whatever else. All happy endings are the same, really, and they don't make /me/ happy because it means the end of a good story.

So... I hate when a good story ends, whether it's tied off neatly or not! I'd rather read a 100k+ well-written story that's unfinished than a 40k well-written story that's marked "complete", simply because there is /more/ of the longer story. And I will always read WIPs or abandoneds because I'd much rather have read half of a great story than none of it at all.

The one thing that does hurt is running out of story unexpectedly, I have learned to watch the number of chapters and wind down my expectations as I near the end of that count.

** The amount of whining entitlement on this thread is incredible. You're being given something for free. Free as in beer. If an author doesn't finish a story for whatever reason, the correct response is to say "Thank you" for what they wrote and then move on.

Saying [it] "hurt my soul" is pathetic. Saying "It's one of the worst things in the world." is idiotic. Saying "I refuse to read WIPs anymore." is disrespectful.

It's always disappointing when a good story isn't finished but that's fanfiction for you. Live with it or go read proper books instead.

*** I always laugh at, "I wont read any WIPs!" coming from "Good stories are never finished!"

You know a way to try to make it so they are? Interact with the writers, talk to them about them, and make them excited to write. Writing is hard. Fanfiction writing is incredibly unfulfilling. There ARE times where I spend a month writing a chapter and it gets 8 reviews in two weeks and I think, "well that was a waste of my time."

Then the very same people who wont read a WIP, or ever leave a damn review that matters, are the ones then calling me entitled for deciding that I have better things to do with my life than spend ninety hours writing a chapter that 900 people read.

***** Nah, I really don't feel bad about this post. I was irked when I finished reading an abandoned WIP. That's perfectly acceptable.

Now I don't find myself agreeing with certain comments like that “WIP authors aren't real writers” or “No one should ever delete their work”, etc.

The whole point about FanFiction is the freedom to create content. That means while you may not like it, people will have opinions about what, how and why certain content is created the way it is.

Well, let's not be too harsh; sometimes it's for [[http://www.viridiandreams.net][health reasons]]. Sure, they might get a [[http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/103][failing mark from Professor Quirrell]], but it doesn't necessarily mean that their writing was poor quality up to that point.

**** But you can't really judge a story until it's completed. For example, while I don't necessarily agree with the opinion, a number of people consider Delenda Est's quality to have taken a nose dive in its second half. And I remember a story completely ruined by the last chapter with a cheap "dramatic twist".

Ultimately, it's like baking a cake. I don't judge your dough - I only judge your cake. And if you never finish baking it, it's not a great cake.
