Looking for any completed (or close to) fics where the winning side goes full Dictator against the losing side. Ant resistance should be futile.

Not quite the same, but there was a One-shot I read a couple of years ago where Voldemort discovers that Harry Is a Horcrux, so he captures him instead and reigns supreme. Harry eventually wakes up and escapes, but 500+ years have passed and Voldemort Is still the inmortal emperor.

** Linkffn(I Am Lord Voldemort?)

Awfully competent but different OC/Voldemort merger.

When Lily said that she'd do anything to save Harry, she didn't expect to receive a snake tattoo, a new identity and a potion brewing job.

  A genre savvy but ignorant of canon OC insert into Voldemort right after the murder of James Potter. Greed replacing pride at the helm of a terrorist group just might change the course of history. After all, the magical world is full of potential waiting to be exploited. (Inspired by The Evil Overlord List and 48 Laws of Power.)

Can't say I've read any fics where ants have gone against their wizarding overlords, but now I need to
