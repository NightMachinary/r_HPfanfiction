I've had this one in my head for a while and it won't go away. I've also read few of Percy helping for the inside story's and they also helped make this prompt.

Percy hates the ministry with a passion. The only reason he even joined in the first place is because of Ron being friend with Harry Potter and as seen by his few year with them both. The major trouble his little brother will be in without help. So he joined and made it seem he was as strict and rule abiding as he could to get his name in higher power. To protect them all.

Next thing he know is faking his hate for his family, and securing the safety of innocent people. He figures out Hogwarts was in under attack quit and finally showed his true colors.

A very very angry Lion!


** He hated it.

He hated it so, /so/ much.

The corruption.

The apathy.

The control.

Percy Weasley /hated/ the Ministry of Magic.

With the Statute of Secrecy codified in 1692, the Wizarding World had gone into hiding. In so doing, they had missed two of the greatest movements of the eighteenth century: The Great Awakening and the Enlightenment.

Even John Locke's writings had fallen on deaf ears--the Ministry of Magic had no concept of personal property rights. No understanding to the general sanctity of life.

He first learned this when he was fourteen.

Percy had been there when Xenophilius Lovegood had explained that he and his daughter had been forced from their home--the Ministry wanted the land Mister Lovegood owned and cultivated as a small orchard. He had refused...and the Ministry had taken not just his land, but also his family's house and most of its contents. By force.

/"Eminent domain," Mr. Lovegood said. "My family has lived there for over a century and now the Ministry says it's theirs because it's the public interest. Everything was in there...my printing press...Pandora's old books...Luna's drawings...Arthur, Molly...what am I going to do?"/

Forcing a widowed father and his daughter from their home...that had been the least of the evils Percy saw the Ministry commit. Because then, he had started to read the papers. And he started to learn.

The petty crooks who cut deals for leverage against the Ministry's political opponents, rather than criminals who actually hurt others. The absolutely terrifying abuses in the justice system with Azkaban, where wizards could be sent without trail.

When he was fifteen, Percy met the Boy Who Lived. Harry Potter. He was a small boy. Small and skinny, with taped up glasses. Fast friends with Percy's brother Ron. The boy needed protection--the Ministry and Muggle governments alike had failed him.

It wasn't a surprise, really. Nothing surprised him anymore. Not after a year of reading the papers. And four years of reading his history books. The one truth that was universal was that power corrupted and that government power corrupted all the more.

When he was sixteen, Percy's little sister had started Hogwarts. And like a fool, he had missed the signs she had been taken in by Dark Magic. Dark Magic that had been smuggled into the school by the thrice-damned Lucius Malfoy. Malfoy, the blood supremacist who had Fudge's ear. Malfoy, who had been accused of sixteen murders, but had gotten off by claiming to be a victim of the Imperius Curse.

The government had sent Hagrid, the gentle gamekeeper to Azkaban. To the dementors. Without trial. To be seen as "doing something."

The government had not sent Lucius Malfoy so much as a letter of notice.

Percy's hatred gained faces. He no longer hated just the Ministry. He also hated Lucius Malfoy and his stooge Fudge.

At seventeen, Percy was of age. And Sirius Black escaped Azkaban. His story was terrifying, but he had never been given his due process of law.

The Ministry had never given Black a fair trial. But sent dementors to guard a school filled with vulnerable children.

Ginny had come crying to Percy the first night, nightmares from the Chamber of Secrets brought to the forefront. Cedric Diggory later approached Percy and reported that Luna was absolutely terrified of the dementors.

The government had brought fear and anxiety to vulnerable children.

Remus Lupin was the new Professor for Defense Against the Dark Arts. He was frequently ill. Percy was no fool--he could read lunar charts. And even if he couldn't, Professor Lupin was never in the Great Hall when there was a full moon in the bewitched ceiling.

But he had read in the papers of Dolores Umbridge's new legislation. Passed in the name of security, it claimed. But the effect was that it made it nigh-on impossible for any such inflicted to find honest work.

There had been a photograph in the paper--Umbridge and Malfoy and Fudge standing side-by-side.

It got worse. Draco Malfoy had taunted a hippogriff--in direct defiance of Professor Hagrid's instructions--and gotten injured. Never mind that Madam Pomfrey had healed him without so much as a scar. Never mind that every single book on hippogriffs urged caution with human interaction. And Draco had called on his father to execute the hippogriff. It was a travesty.

Then there was the edict to give Black a Dementor's Kiss on sight. That had sent a chill down Percy's spine. To take a man's soul--to deny him the afterlife--there was no greater evil.

Not a month later, Xenophilius Lovegood was arrested and sentenced to Azkaban--the latest issue of the /Quibbler/ had been a full-length critique of Fudge's decisions. "Seditious acts" had been what the /Daily Prophet/ had said. "He's stirring insurrection" the paper had quoted Malfoy as saying.

Ginny had smuggled Luna into Gryffindor Common Room that night. As Head Boy, Percy was supposed to report this. It was a violation of the rules. But Percy looked the other way.

His path was set.

As the sun rose over Hogwarts, Percy mailed out an application to the Ministry of Magic. An entry-level job in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.

Percy Weasley hated the Ministry. But he saw the value and virtue in rules. Especially rules that abided by Natural Law.

He would see to it that the witches and wizards of Britain would be free. Even if he had to kill every power-hungry schemer and sycophant to do it. Any who would oppress others for their own gains would have to be destroyed.

And he would do it from within.

*** Absolutely brilliant! Thank you. Slightly too good Percy (you haven't got to the disaster of the Triwizard Tournament and Percy's rather indefensible behaviour during it), but it would be really worthy of developing into full-size story. Thank you.

**** Crouch apparently spoke 200 languages and mind-controlled his son for over a decade. Either one implies a talent for mental magic of some variety.

Percy might have seen something he shouldn't have, went investigating, and Crouch decided to prevent any future "indiscretions".

The mental rewiring breaks over the months after Crouch's death, and Percy is absolutely furious at his family for not noticing anything.

**** Oh, I definitely see your point, but I wanted to focus on /pre-Ministry/ Percy first.
