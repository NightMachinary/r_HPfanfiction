** Harry and the kids have a wall in the house decorated with cut out newspaper and magazine articles. They all refer to Harry as 'Ginny's husband', his own name unmentioned, in the photo captions.

The kids have grown up under the shadow of the legend of Harry Potter and its become a game that the three of them have with their father- it makes him a little more human, a little more ordinary. At some point, /Witch Weekly/ had stopped reporting on Harry Potter sightings and started speculating on Ginny Weasley's workout routine. The Wizarding world had moved on from their preoccupation with the vanquisher of the Dark Lord. The family couldn't be prouder of Ginny's accomplishments, both on the quidditch field and in her writing.

Ginny says nothing of their project until one day she receives a card in the mail. She passes it to Albus Severus to open and gestures for him to add it to the collection. The invitation says: "Ginny Weasley plus one."

It takes place of pride on the wall.

** Harry Potter was perfectly happy, thank you very much.

He had a lovely wife, three amazing children and all the friends and comfort he could ever ask for. Ginny was his world, she completed him. Life consisted of Auror work, domestic bliss and vigorously chewing his fingernails in the final minutes of his wife's latest Quidditch match.

Being the husband of the generation's most famed Quidditch player was an incredible experience. His children had never once had to worry about their home lives being even a fraction as sad and lonely as his had been at their age.

Ginny's fan would often send amazing gifts to their idol and a barrage of post owls would often join the Potters as they sat down, Lily making sure they all had some treats before they were sent on their way again.

His wife's stardom did bring challenges, Witch Weekly seemingly had an endless assembly line of Rita Skeeter disciples eager to find the next big dramatic scoop going on in Ginny's life.

A particularly sordid mess had occured in Albus's fourth year when a rumor went around the school that his classmate Lawrence Corner was in fact Ginny's love child after the boy had made a Gryffindor Chaser position.

Harry knew he wasn't the most perceptive bloke but he was fairly sure he would have spotted Ginny having an unexplained pregnancy. To make a long story short, James had /eagerly/ taught Lawrence the Bat Boogey Hex and the Slytherins who had spread the rumour lived to regret it.

Awestruck young fans would often crowd around Ginny whenever the family would make their annual school shopping trip in Diagon Alley. Seeing the bright, young children giddy with excitement warmed Harry's heart. These children were too young to have ever heard of Voldemort, to have ever felt the sting of the war.

One day as Ginny was busy herself siging autographs for a group of jelly legged Hufflepuff sixth years, Harry noticed one of their brothers (no older than five and wearing a Holyhead Harpies scarf) looking at him with wide eyes.

'Hello there' said Harry bending down to reach the boy's height

The boy turned pink

'A-Are you Mistah Ginny Potter..' he asked

/Mistah Ginny Potter/

Harry liked the sound of that

'Wouldn't have it any other way' he replied.

All was well
