  A man appears at the gates of Malfoy Manor. Draco Malfoy isn't the average first choice for a hero sent back in time to save the world. Narcissa Malfoy, slightly surprised to see the grown man her eleven-year-old son could be, isn't the average first choice for his Horcrux-hunting partner either. Honestly, they're supposed to be on the other side in all this business. But it cannot be denied that they're very efficient, especially given their quest is relegated to Narcissa's free time and Draco is relegated to a guest wing bedroom so his father and younger self don't interfere. Nor can it be denied that if the Dark Lord isn't going to show them loyalty and victory, then... well... Family First, after all.

** - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/Exile][Exile]] by bennybear is a good fic from what I read so far. It's Draco centric and very close to cannon about what happened with him after the war.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11377120/1/Hogwarts-Marauding-the-Timeline][Hogwarts: Marauding the Timeline]] by Hplover4ever3 is a Draco time travel fic that takes place in the Marauder's Era.

I absolutely love the story. No slashes or romances, just pure chance of Draco and Harry becoming friends. (I have nothing against slashes or romances, I just want something that shows character growth.) Anyways, this is a what-if story where Draco finds Sirius' diary and he starts to question pureblood life. Everything is cannon until the beginning of the summer before their 3rd Year.

  It was all because of that stupid diary Draco had found when he went his mother to visit 12 Grimmauld Place. If he hadn't started reading it then he wouldn't know about this Padfoot and he definitely wouldn't be questioning everything he had been taught since he was old enough to listen. He definitely wouldn't be standing outside of Harry Potter's house. That damn diary.

  "I'm Sirius Black," said the boy. "Who the hell are you?" Draco hesitated. Well how the hell was he supposed to answer this? / / Back in 1976, Draco has a lot on his hands...avoiding questions (both students' and teachers'), playing his part well, & trying himself to understand why on earth he was sorted into Gryffindor this time around. It's going to be one hell of a ride. . .

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.
