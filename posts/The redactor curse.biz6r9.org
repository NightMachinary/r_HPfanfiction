Idea came from a fic that misspelled the reducto curse as redacto. Stops the victim from saying a certain word. (It might technically be a jinx but who is counting). I'm not a good writer by any means but here is a snippet to show what I meant.

During the final battle:

"Redacto!"

The periwinkle blue burst of magic flew from the tip of Harry's wand and hit the Dark Lord right in the throat. Confusion could be seen on the faces of all those observing what they hoped would be the final fight of the war, for nobody had ever heard of that spell before.

"... Kedavra!"

Even more confusion spread and the Dark Lord lifted his wand up to his face at the fact that he had been unable to perform one of his signature spells. Harry quickly took advantage of this momentary lapse in the Dark Lord's focus on him and hit him with a disarming spell.

/Silencio/ achieves the same. Infact it does even better, considering the target can't speak at all.

No incantation = no spell for most of <5th year. And less powerful silent spells for remaining.

+It makes no difference with Voldemort though+

*** It reminds me why Avada Kedavra is the stupidest curse in the series. Why would you ever use a different spell? Why throw a reducto or a curse to make their intestines melt if you can literally kill them with a single spell instead?

Which means it is obviously exhausts the user after casting it. And in book 3, Harry is shown to be exhausted after casting patronus. He wasn't able to cast a patronus multiple times.

Also, why do you think Tom Riddle in chamber of secrets didn't cast avadakedavra to kill Harry?

************* Powerful bit of magic? Maybe it's hard to perform but costs little. Maybe it costs a lot and Voldemort is just powerful. That doesn't say anything. Let's also not forget that Voldemort was able to cast it three times on the Potter Family without anything telling us was weakened by the spells.

AK is not just magically draining. It also requires huge amount of will and intent. And it is slower when compared to less powerful ones like expelliarmus or stupefy. Even Voldemort surely cannot depend only on it in a battlefield.

James and Lily being defenseless matters. It's because they are defenseless that Voldemort was confident/arrogant enough to use killing curse thrice. Had they been in duel it would have been different thing. Perhaps it is also the reason why his third killing curse was redirected to Voldemort by Lily's sacrificial protection instead of merely being stopped.

***************** I don't think that's the case. Considering that between Voldemort and DUmbledore's fight in ootp, Voldemort was throwing the torture curse and killing case around like candy. During the final battle, unforgivable were also being cast like crazy. I don't think Voldemort was that confident in facing Dumbledore.

In the hunt for Ravenclaw's diadem, Crabbe (Or was it Goyle?) was casting the killing curse at Ron in the Room of Requirements. I think we all know that Malfoy's minion's are magically weak, so they should not have been able to cast the killing curse.

My head canon is that JK Rowling meant to write the Harry Potter franchise for children, since a lot of children's books are about love and friendship defeating evil, but children grow up after 10 years into teenagers, so they begin to question why the main characters weren't killing the baddies.

Two missed killing curses. One redirected to statue. Dumbledore's conjured flaming unicorn changed to flaming snake and redirected. Dumbledore dunks it in conjured water. Then Voldemort retreats. (Tries to posses Harry, but fails).

He just only recited the incantation. It wouldn't have worked even if it hit Ron. All would have happened is perhaps a nosebleed.

I mean, when Harry recited the incantation of patronus charm for the first time and thin silvery wisp appread, it doesn't mean that patronus was successfully cast. That's why it disappeared quickly infront of boggart turned dementor.

I seem to remember the fight being a lot more than that, but I might need to reread that scene. I don't think this is because killing curses use a lot of power, more like Voldemort has to think creatively because Dumbledore is as good as he is.

Neither of us knows what would actually happen if the killing curse hit Ron so this is pure assumption.

True, but remember that the Patronus charm in canon depended more on will than power, since a lot of adults can't cast it either.

Remember that in canon Wizarding Britain, the aurors were largely ineffective against death eaters until Barty Crouch Sr gave the order to make killing curses legal.

My head canon still stands that killing curse isn't used by good guys because Harry Potter was meant to be a children's story of love and friendship defeating evil.

** Yea, the spell is pretty useless in combat as [[/u/QuotablePatella][u/QuotablePatella]] said, but maybe it can be good outside of it. Having it be used on Ron, Harry, and Hermione to prevent them from saying Voldemort would be very useful.
