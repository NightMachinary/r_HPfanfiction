I've always been very interested in the James and Lilly storyline and stuff like that. This is my first time looking into HP fanfiction so I'll appreciate any good recommendations.

Any that involve Potters parents or the war should be good.


** Master Slytherin's Ruin is a great look at the first war - through the eyes of a Harry who accidentally hopped dimensions.

** I'll be back with links...

So, I apparently went through and decided to delete most of my saved/Favorited stories. This is unfortunate, and I'm sorry if I got you excited about it. I'll make note of any ones I do find, though, and pass them onto you.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1226706/1/][Paradox of Existance]] is a Harry travels back in time and meets his parents with a fairly interesting look into Lily, James, Sirius, Remus, and Snape. It is also HP/SS slash, so I'm not sure how you feel about that.

Edit: second and third paragraphs.

**** Harry Potter Severus Snape romantic/sexual relationship usually. Occasionally, it will refer to Harry Potter Salazar Slytherin relationship.
