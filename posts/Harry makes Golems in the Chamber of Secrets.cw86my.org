:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I seem to remember a fic where Harry spends a lot of time making various magical Golems within the Chamber of Secrets. I think it was mostly during Fourth Year, particularly during the Triwizard Tournament. In particular, for the First Task I believe Harry covers the whole task with smoke, then produces sound effects to fake a great battle he has with his dragon. I also seem to remember that he finds and trains himself to use to musical spell that can act as an orchestra.

I feel like a portrait of Salazar Slytherin was involved as well, but I may be mixing things up with A Cadmean Victory. Anyone recognize the fic?


** Pretty sure it is this one:

*** I think that's it! Thanks, I forgot it was a self-insert. It's just about the only one I've ever enjoyed.

** I'm not sure as it's been a bit since I read the fic, but I believe it may be The Lie I've Lived by jbern.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

*** It definitely is. And the dragon battle is a choir of howlers playing a rock song (can't remember which).

*** Nah, that was just the one full golem and a temporary one. He didn't conjure smoke either, his solution was hundreds of Howlers screaming Paint it Black I think.

*** I actually originally thought that was it as well, since it's pretty similar, but I don't think it's it. Not a bad fic though, actually just reread it, which I rarely am able to enjoy.

** I know which one you're talking about and it's not Cadmean Victory. Unfortunately, I don't recall off the top of my head.
