Severus Snape, hated that he knew these things, he really did. But he couldn't help but notice odd shapes in his tea, or the strange cloud pattern. So he knew, he knew with absolute certainty, he would be seeing the head master today. As if on queue there is a knock on his door and the headmaster walked in.

"I'm sorry to impose my boy, but Sybil has taken I'll, I am going to need you to substitute for a few classes if you could please."

Severus sighed and let his head hit the table, regretting that night of his greatest mistake and his decision to learn everything he could about prophecies.


** Severus stared at the boy's cup. All he could see was his own failure. Trelawney was right as usual. Potter was going to have another brush of death this year. But what should he say about that blasted cup. Everyone knew that old seer kept predicting the boy's death. If she was any decent at the job she would have seen the subtleties. She was lucky she had the actual gift or no one would pay here to predict the weather, let alone a fortune.

Still she was right about this one... The boy was so completely destined for death it was hard not to think the several accidents he was going to have this year might not be the cause. No, the boy has always made a friend of death. These incidents would not kill him, but death would not toy with him forever and it looks like death was starting to get impatient if his cup was any indicator.

With a dramatic sigh he pronounced the boy's fate in as unbelievable of a tone he could muster. "I think this is where my colleague would have me say 'you will be lucky to live the rest of the year.'" Sneering at the boy, doing everything he could to avoid looking into those eyes. Those eyes would pierce his soul and demand everything, but he could change this. It was his fault, but there was no fixing this cup. "Do make sure you enjoy your fame while it lasts though. It is what your sainted father would do."

He put the cup back down and stalked off to another student. Sometimes he wished he could be kinder to the boy, but he couldn't look at the boy without seeing all of his failures, past and future mocking him in those eyes. He could not stop this, he just hoped his own would come before he had to watch the life drained from those eyes another time,

*** I love it! I wonder if Hermione would still disbelieve the subject if Snape taught it.
