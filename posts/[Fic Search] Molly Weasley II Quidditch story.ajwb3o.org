Read this one a while ago but can't remember it's title or author. Pretty sure it was on HPFF but I could be wrong (searches there haven't resulted)

Molly was a reserve player for the Harpies (if I remember correctly) had crazy hair dyed the colour of her team - changed it to match her new team - think it was the Magpies.

New team was failing previously, old coach quit/left, assistant coach who had been a player himself before being injured, is the one left to reignite the team, alongside the manager.

He has an ex-wife, Mariah (can't remember his name though) and they at one point go off to a team building retreat. Molly ends up falling in love with him.

Molly's cousins are kinda crazy, her sister Lucy is married to a Quidditch player, some long weird name starting with H - believe he played for the Arrows.

I can remember all this but not the title or author ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜… Anyone know which one this is? Definitely completed.
