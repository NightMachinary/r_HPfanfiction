:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So, I'm looking for a fic where Hogwarts appears physically as a woman to Harry in the Room of Requirement. Also he is in touch with the four founders through their portraits as well. When he asks the founders about said woman, Godric and Rowena actually wonder how the castle gained that level of sentience and Godric tells Rowena that she may not be who she claims to actually be (he says this to Rowena, not in front of Harry though)

Any idea which fic this is?


** Sounds a lot like The Merging by Shaydrall. I cant link atm as I'm on my phone and dont know how to, but I remembered that scene vividly.

Edit: trying this linkffn(TheMerging)

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

** I know that linkffn(passageways) has a manifestation of Hogwarts.

But, I remember a scene like that from somewhere, but it might actually be from a different story, hope this is it though!

*** Close, but not the one I'm looking for. In this fic Harry also regularly trains with the physical aspect of Hogwarts. Thank you for your input in any case.
