I was reading the illustrated Goodreads version of Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness earlier and I wanted to know if there were any good stories with a lot of artwork/fan art within the body of text. I'm also interested in any good fics with unique cover art. I'm not picky about pairings or plot as long as it's well-written. I just want to read a story that draws you in with description as well as imagery to go along with it.
