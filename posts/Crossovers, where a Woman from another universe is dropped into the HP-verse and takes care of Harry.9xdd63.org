Preferably in a mother role. No slash, no Death Eater whitewashing, no complete universe crossovers (eg dumping the whole Marvel cast in the HP world).

** Well there are a number of black widow as harry's mother figure fics, but I can't seem to find them atm. The plot is still unfolding, so not sure if other universe counts, but balancing the scales has a female Revan looking after harry. linkffn(12950462)

While not a woman, any list of other universe caretaker of harry stories is incomplete without the glorious crack that is 'itachi, is that a baby?' linkffn(11634921)

  Dumbledore is of the Light, Voldemort is of the Dark, and both consider the Boy-Who-Lived to be the linchpin to all their plans. What neither had ever considered was a lost and very bored Darth Revan taking the boy under her wing to train him as a Gray Knight, just because she could. Bastila is of course fondly exasperated, but at least HK-47 finds the entire situation entertaining

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

Naruto crossover. Kushina and Lily die in their universes. Somehow they meet in limbo and can understand each other. Both try and get put back into the living world, but obviously that's not allowed. For some reason they're able to get themselves placed into each other's world instead.

*** Well, my own "No Longer Alone" started out because I found the lack of "protective adoptive family" stories disturbing. At least ones where Harry does not bang his adoptive sister in the end. The "momma-bear" role is split between Nymphadora and Andromeda.

Keep in mind that it is a pretty family-centric story, so no big action sequences or explosions. A little more friendship focused (Katie Bell, Hermione, Leanne) during the school year.

*** One of those popular rune stories (just order FF filters by favourites, and completed and you'll see them.)has professor Babbling take him in. In it she's a young 20 yo or so professor just out of hogwarts. It was the first FF I read with her in it, so I always find it jarring when I read about her being old and boring like most other Ffs I've read since then.

Very much. I found the whole thing rather unbelievable because Harry runs into the Weasleys and Lupin long before even starting Hogwarts. And because it was way too much pre-teenage children interacting and too little family fluff or BAMF Jedi kicking arse.
