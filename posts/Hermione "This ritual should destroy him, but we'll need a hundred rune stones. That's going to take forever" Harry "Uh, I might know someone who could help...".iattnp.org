** "But Professor Potter, that's ridiculous! How could a MUGGLE device be so important in defeating Voldemort!"

Harry pinched the bridge of his nose as he audibly sighed. Ten years on from the battle, and four years into his time teaching History of Magic at Hogwarts, and he still managed to get this reaction from classes whenever he told this particular story.

"I assure you it's true" he sighed, "I was there after all. And Voldemort would never have been defeated without it. As the Minister so often reminds me, the PD-500 is an incredibly reliable tool with a proven track record in more than just the war against Voldemort."

The class notably perked up, and Harry internally groaned. Give it a few seconds and the usual question would come... Why couldn't he keep his mouth shut? Honestly, he preferred it back when HE was the centre of all Voldemort related attention, and that was saying something!

"You know the Minister, Professor? What's he like? My father says he's amazing! This country wouldn't be the same without him he says! We wouldn't have won the war without him he says, and without his strong leadership and business knowledge the country would never have recovered so quickly! Truly a wizard beyond all of us he says!"

"Yes, yes I'm acquainted with the Minister, Mister Donovan. Thank you. It's true that we were lucky to have him on our side in the war, and as much as we've never really gotten along that well..."

"Do you not like the Minister, Professor? Why? My dad says he's a hero and if he hadn't brought us all those PD-500s when he did we'd all be dead! He can't really be bad can he?! The papers say he's an orphan lover and everything! Raised one himself while running his drill company, but that was before he got into politics of course!"

Harry sighed once more. "My history with Minister Dursley is complicated, Mister Donovan, and that's all I have to say on the subject. We're here to study modern wizarding history. Now, let's get back to our discussion on the PD-500 thank you very much."

*** Unfortunately however, fate tended to have a way of playing games with Harry sometimes. Before he could get any further, there was a knock at the classroom door and the Head Boy stuck his head inside.

"Excuse me Professor Potter, sorry to interrupt but the Headmistress is asking for you. She says it's urgent."

'What god did you upset this morning?' his internal monologue muttered as he quickly dismissed the class and hurriedly made his way to the Headmistress' office. Going up there always made him think of old times, when it had been Dumbledore sat behind the desk and it felt like magic oozed from every corner of the room. A long, long time ago now though...

He gave himself a moment to compose himself before entering the office, but as his gaze swept the room his heart sank at what he found even as his Aunt Petunia, now in her own fourth year as Headmistress of Hogwarts, spoke up first.

"There you are, you took your time." she snapped, "Don't you think we have better things to do than wait around for you all day? We raised you better than this, honestly..."

Turning her back on him and bustling over to a dresser which sat where he still remembered Fawkes' perch sitting, he mumbled out a quick "Sorry Aunt Petunia" before the great comfy chair which had once housed the greatest wizard to have ever lived swivelled round to face him.

"Don't you take that tone with your Aunt boy, and show her some respect! That's 'Headmistress' to you! We didn't spend all those years beating the freakishness out of you only to let poor manners take its place!"

"Why can't you be more like our Diddums?!" his Aunt snapped, whilst slipping on a pair of extremely ostentatious sapphire earrings whilst looking at a still picture of Dudley sat upon the dresser. "Always so polite, he understands what it's like to act with dignity!"

"Quite right Pet," Vernon agreed. "And I won't stand for any more of this disrespect, boy. You're not a child any more and we gave you this job to try and make something of you! You were a disgrace to the family name when we met and made that Grunnings deal all those years ago, and I'll be damned if we'll have you running around like that tarring our name after all the hard work we're putting in to fix this world of yours!"

"Of course Minister." he wearily replied, long experience telling him that arguing would not be the correct course of action here.

"That's better." Vernon bristled. "Now, we've got an important Ministry function to attend this evening - I'm looking to close a very lucrative deal for us - and the country of course. As soon as your Aunt's ready we're going to be leaving. And we're both ready for a break, so it'll be a few days before she returns. We expect you to look after the school whilst we're away."

Harry couldn't help himself - he'd planned to see Ron and Hermione that night. "But what about Dudley! Isn't he supposed to be the Deputy Headmaster?!"

"Don't you dare take that tone with me!" Vernon thundered, before a sly smile crept onto his face. "You listen to me and listen good, boy. You will do what you're told. I run this freakish society now and don't you forget it. Things could be very difficult for you if the conqueror of Voldewotsit turned Minister of Magic let slip about some of the things you got up to when you were younger. How you terrified poor Petunia and Dudders during your schooling and nearly poisoned us on this world and magic entirely."

"And where would all these freaks be without us, eh boy? Don't you forget that debt you owe to me for the help I gave you during that war all those years ago. Life debt was it? That bushy haired know-it-all of yours said it would be very painful if it were broken, didn't she?"

The room fell silent, a cold biting tension filling the air. Before either could break it though, Petunia sniffed and turned to face them.

"I'm ready Vernon, let's go. I can't bear to stay in this filthy castle a moment longer."

"Right you are, Pet." Vernon replied as he took her hand and led her to the office door, only pausing for a second to issue a final threat before slamming the door behind them. "You remember what I said boy. If Dudders tells us ANYTHING has been out of the ordinary whilst we're gone you'll be for it!"

With them gone, Harry slumped back against the desk as the tension slowly drained out of him. How in the hell had the world come to this?

** /The room was dark, but not silent. No, along the pillared walls, there was hissing, clanking, and other mechanical noises. The air was humid and thick with dust and ash. The only light provided by a line of flickering flourescent bars hanging from somewhere high above./

"And who is this, that dares enter my hewn halls?" came the booming voice, echoing through the room. The three wizards grasped their wands tighter and advanced, jumping at every loud CLACK or PLINK emanating from the dancing shadows.

"We are seekers! We beseech the mighty Vernon, to grant us a drill!" Shouted the leader defiantly. The lights bathed everything in monochrome light, but his eyes held a hint of color. The three planted themselves in a defensive formation before the machine throne, two keeping watch and one speaking.

The figure in the dark throne did not look impressed. He hefted his immense bulk forward in a lean, looming over their frightened forms. The shadows veiled his face, but a feral grin was visible underneath.

"And what might you need with one of my drills, /boy/?" he whispered, the noise almost lost in the rising steam.

The leader shrunk back as though struck, but his companions held fast and he gained strength from them.

"Our quest is survival! Not just our own, but the survival of us all... including you."

The mighty one shifted backwards, the springs and pistons creaking in his chair. He sunk into a shadow, in thought.

"Your reasoning is compelling, yet I wonder... will your enemy find me here, in my hewn halls?" The flickering light glinted in his mirrored sunglasses, and his moustache quivered in the shadow.

"He finds all." was the response.

"I am willing to consider it... yet first, you must prove yourselves worthy of my drills. Not merely any man is meant to wield one... only the strongest, most ruthless and cunning will do."

His chair elevated, the hydraulics protesting under the weight pressed upon them, as he loomed above.

"Survive my gauntlet, and you shall have your drill."

/Suddenly, the ambient noises grew faint, then stopped. The mist began thickening, and so did the dust in the air - with a start, all three cast a spell to allow breathing, and another to shield their eyes. Suddenly, the other man fell backwards, pointing at something behind the two. They turned around, and beheld the largest drill they'd ever seen, coming right at them./
