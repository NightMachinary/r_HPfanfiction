I /think/ it was about Hermione. I don't believe it was on either FFnet or AO3; my memory of the layout feels different. I only read the first few chapters and it was quite a while ago; it's not in the internet history on my current computer.

It bothers me how few details I can think of, makes it very hard to search for. I mostly just remember it was a completely no-magic-exists AU. I think she was discovered and invited there because she'd done something clever and underhanded, maybe hacking or something?
