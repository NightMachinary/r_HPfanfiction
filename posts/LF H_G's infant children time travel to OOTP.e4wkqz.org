Hi, I'm looking for fics where Harry and Ginny's children (preferably as really little toddlers or infants) go back in time and Harry and Ginny have to look after them. I have read one before called 'James Wants Mummy' on ffn and really liked it. I was wondering if anybody else has found more stories with the same idea.


** Im pretty sure this was a challenge subject on SIYE a few years ago, there are definitely a few stories on this topic over there. Perhaps you could PM Gin110881 on the Harryand Ginny page to clarify
