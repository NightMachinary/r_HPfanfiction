** That wrong BWL Harry/Fleur one where he ran away as a kid and made a blood wand and summoned some demon knight. He gets hired as a bodyguard for Fleur and pretty sure he tames a dragon.

The dragon fight and outcome was such a great read and its such a shame that it stopped where it did cause it seemed like the real meat of the story was about to start.

So I recognize this as generic cheesy Harrymione Ron bashing, and filled to burst with fart jokes and more bashing than you can shake a leg at.

But it has my favorite crack pairing of all time. Krumgood? Lunator? Krum/Luna is goofy and the Yule Ball scene made me chuckle, so to hell with it.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

** The Brightest Witch of Her Age by chocolateberrycake. It's a Charlie/Hermione story where the latter is a Veela. I have to say that it has some of the worst grammar and spelling I've ever seen (the author spelled "legs" as "leggs" in Chapter 1; that's in close proximity to "chrystal", "headmester", and "Mya" acting as a nickname for Hermione). However, it's a fun read and as another user said, a "guilty pleasure".
