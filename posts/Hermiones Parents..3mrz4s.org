I know that their names don't come up in canon, but why does a lot of fanfictions call them Dan and Emma. (Not that I am complaining, I think it is perfect.)


** Yeah it's an H/Hr fandom easter-egg turned full-blown meme. I don't like it, but mostly because it makes it harder to talk specifically about good and bad fanfic representations of Hermione's parents. (It also comes off as a warning for some of the H/Hr tropes I really dislike, like manipulative characters and love potions and sudden shifts in character. Not all Dan/Emma fics are bad, but most bad H/Hr fics do the Dan/Emma thing.)

I was just rereading "Years of Rebellion," and I think FP's Tom and Cordelia Granger are great there---Cordelia, in particular, is an interesting representation of Hermione if she hadn't met Ron or Harry [or any "open"/"fun" friends] until somewhat later in life, and both of them behave in a realistically complex way toward all these people and relationships they're suddenly exposed to.

In general I think the Grangers are a great opportunity for fanfic writers who want to stay close to canon while still deepening existing characters and opening the world up to new ones, since we know so little about them and they're both full-on Muggles.

*** I just like the idea of the names being consistent over lots of stories. I am not a huge fan of going. "Alright, in this story they are Robert and Jean, gotta remember that. Oh, now they are Martin and Sarah, gotta remember that."

**** I like the idea of the names being consistent too, but I absolutely hate "Dan and Emma" because the whole fic, I'm then picturing the actors- Harry being Hermione's dad, and Hermione being her... own... mother. It's horrible.

I just wish JKR would give us some names on Pottermore, then everyone could use those.

** Fanon memes should not dictate writing. They are fun but Snape should not always be Draco's Godfather, as James Potter should not always be an Auror, the HeadBoy and Girl in the same dormitory, nor should the Purebloods all be Pagans (pantheon to your discretion) and The Golden Trio should only ever be a very bad Rita Skitter book.

Same opinion for the Grangers, either Dan/Robert, Emma/Jean/Jane/Mary, are they fun? yeah. Okay to use? sure. But don't let popular use of them close doors to your imagination.

** I'm a Harmony-convert - I haven't seen many H/Hr fics with Dan and Emma, but now that I understand why they are called that, I feel like that nod to the movies might pull me out of the story a bit.

But I suppose if most writers do it, the consistency is good for the fandom...?

***** I'll second your welcome to the club. Your informational packet and complimentary Koolaid mix should arrive in the mail shortly.

But, back to the topic... since I'm writing a FemHarry/Hermione story, I'm naming Hermione's parents Lindsey and Emma (not that they've appeared yet - it'll be quite a few chapters until that happens). I'm curious to see if any readers will figure out why.

** My aunt swears that this is a true story:

Drs. Florence and Winston Granger's first conversation did not take place in University halls - nor at an international dentistry conference - but in a chip shop around Farringdon in the early hours of a Saturday morning in 1973.

Florence was absolutely off her face at the time, while Winston, the product of a strict Bajan upbringing, generally shied away (and does to this day) from the indulgence of harder drugs. They were actually in close proximity for the whole night, but while Florence was embroiled in a particularly riotous session of Ring of Fire, Winston enjoyed an open forum of green philosophy among friends on the balcony of his friend's flat. A mass exodus from the house party in search of sustenance was suggested, and six years later, Hermione Jean Granger started talking as soon as she left the womb.

Aaaaanyways... though it started with H/Hr, is it not odd that one might find Dramione fics where they still go by Dan and Emma? Romione fics, even. It keeps throwing the actors into my imagination, and with Dan being eternally 13, it's just... yeah.

Yeah, fanon propagates even to fics that don't intend to make the allusion that had spawned it. This is a one of the more benign examples, IMO.

** Basically, because of the authors, and because some people have problems with checking their facts.

That being said, I do remember one fic where the author called them “Emma/nuel/” and “Dan/iela/”, pretty much for the amusement factor. I don't remember if the story was good or not or even what story it was, but I do remember the names because of how amusing a “take that” it was.

** Honesty, any story that goes in depth enough to require naming Hermione's parents, probably isn't going to be all that great. And, using Dan and Emma.... I could see MAYBE using Jean, inferred from Hermione's middle name... but it's just another one of those annoying tropes that just won't die like Ice Queen Daphne.

*** That is a bit of a weird statement. Ron's parents, Neville's grandmother and parents, Sirius' parents, Remus' parents, Harry's parents and caretakers (ugh, that feels wrong for describing those people) are all named in canon. Considering the amount of Hermione-centric fanfiction that exists, her parents being named is really not that weird.
