Can be from any era/any site/any length/old or new/anyone can be the MC

Does NOT have to be the main thing about the story.

NOT looking for any pairings, but am fine with het/slash/femslash/etc

I'm adding this as a prompt idea as well, if anyone wants to write it.


** You need to read Bad Education and its one-shot side stories! It's an AU where Dumbledore gave Tom Riddle the DADA job, and it's a comedy, but there's tons of scenes of the professors hanging out (the side-story "Yes or No?" is just Minerva McG and several other female staff members having a conversation in the faculty lounge, for instance.)

**** Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13854078/1/Ornamental-Precautions]]) is short but a laugh.

Linkao3([[https://www.archiveofourown.org/works/8125531]]) is Harry being a teacher.

Linkao3(Let it Choke by TheDivineComedian) is Remus being a teacher.

Linkao3(Of a Linear Circle by Flamethrower) is a veeery long story following Severus Snape x OC. It's incredible but an acquired taste. I only rec it because there's excellent staffroom content.

Linkao3([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13798830/1/Super-Blood-Wolf-Moon]]) is fine as well...

That's the ones off the top of my head

  “You understand, Professor,” Harry began, after a moment, “that I don't have my N.E.W.T.s. I never even finished seventh year. Between everything, I never had a chance the first time around, and then afterwards there didn't seem to be much point. Hermione argued for it, of course, but I was so tired of Britain. So technically, I am completely unqualified for the position.”“Quite a way to begin an interview, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said, dryly.Or, three years after the war, Harry Potter becomes Hogwarts' newest Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.

  Remus Lupin certainly knew what he should do: Keep his distance. Reassure Susan that running from the Boggart was perfectly fine and understandable. Have her write “I will not skip Defence Against the Dark Arts” five hundred times and then send her on her way, ensuring that whatever issues she had would be dealt with in the proud tradition of the wizarding world: Through avoidance and denial.Except he knew where that path lead.And if he ever wanted to help the Boy Who Lived With Terrible Memories, he should probably start heading down a different one.

  "The school greeted Minerva McGonagall's return with delight. Minerva threw herself into her work, proving herself a strict but inspirational teacher. If she kept letters from Dougal McGregor locked in a box under her bed, this was (she told herself firmly) better than keeping her wand locked there. Nevertheless, it was a shock to learn from the oblivious Isobel (in the middle of a chatty letter of local news) that Dougal had married the daughter of another farmer. Albus Dumbledore discovered Minerva in tears in her classroom late that evening, and she confessed the whole story to him. Albus Dumbledore offered both comfort and wisdom, and told Minerva some of his own family history, previously unknown to her. The confidences exchanged that night between two intensely private and reserved characters were to form the basis of a lasting mutual esteem and friendship." - Pottermore
