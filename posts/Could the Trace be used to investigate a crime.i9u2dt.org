From Canon, we know that the Trace is, by lack of better term, a spell put on every magical children, which is active until the day they become of age (though we don't know when, or how the Trace is attached to the children). The Trace detectany spell used in the vinicity of a underage witch or wizard, and its goal is to enforce the "Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery", which forbid minors to use magic, unless it is to protect himself in a dangerous situation.

In HBP, Dumbledore also explained that the Trace cannot determine who used Magic in the vinicity of a minor (it could be him, or a near adult wizard), or even whose Trace activated. Because of this, we know that the Ministry will assume, unless proven otherwise, that an muggle raised Underage wizard will be responsible for any Magic used in his "territory", that is to say his neighbourhood (Privet Drive, or even Litthe Whinging for Harry as an example). As for the children raised in a magical household, their Trace is probably ignored since it would activate several times a day.

But there is one aspect of the Trace that has been bothering me. From Harry experience (in both CoS and OotP), we see that the Trace, while it cannot detect who used a spell, can detect which spell was used (since the official letters he received minutes after the incidents both specified which spell was responsible for his warning).\\
It made me wonder if the Ministry could not use the Trace to investigate when a forbiden spell was used. As an example, we regularly see fics where Sirius (or any child of a "Dark" family) is disciplined with Dark Magic, sometimes even submitted to the Cruciatus Curse. In these situations, shouldn't the Ministry knock at their door minutes after the attack, ready to sent to Azkaban anyone who used an Unforgivable?

What are your thoughts about it?


** As is often the case in these situations, I find the most helpful thing is to think about the Muggle equivalent.

Imagine if the government proposed placing a microphone on every child that would feed to the government certain key words which are said within the vicinity of that child. The information the government receives in the event of a "hit" against a key word is simply which key word was used and the location.

I think it's fair to say that people would be pretty nervous about this idea. In the magical world, there is perhaps sufficient justification for its existence: the danger that uncontrolled, underage magic poses to the statute of secrecy, which is the cornerstone of magical society. However, even where this level of intrusion is permitted, one imagines that people would be pretty concerned to see the system used only for its original, intended purpose.

You can imagine, over time, the Ministry attempting mission creep and trying to use the information for other things. But you can equally see people like Lucius Malfoy - who rages against the fact that the Ministry dares to enter his private property in CoS - exerting their considerable political influence to ensure that the system is not used to encroach upon their privacy.

So no, I don't think the Ministry would be permitted to "spy" on families using the Trace system. I think its use would be strictly limited to prevention of underage magic.

This type of explanation is often the answer whenever one thinks up an apparently clever use of magic to solve a societal problem. More often than not, it's a use of magic that people would very much oppose as government overreach.

** I always wondered why the Trace didn't register or wasn't set up to alert on the unforgivables when they were used and then have a "ready" team of Aurors to immediately arrive.

Canon implies/states that the trace is more focused on muggleborn areas because they don't have to guess who may have used magic there (completely ignoring a magical showing up in that area using magic the apparating away leaving the muggleborn in trouble.)

Rowling never mentioned it in the books (so what I'm going to say is not really "canon"), but apparently, she later explained that the Aurors were a very small elite force, like "the few Aurors shown in the story already represent a significant portion of their force" small. Such a small force probably can't afford to put an intervention team on hold for an alert that may never ring.\\
Though the Wizarding Britain has the "Magical Patrol" that takes care of the public order and that has the effectives to intervene on such an alert (even if it may be above their pay grade).

*** Ron said something about how it was a bit impossible for the Trace to affect them now that they're 17. He very quickly dismiss that as a possible way for them to be tracked

I take this as meaning that the magic for the Trace is very old and hard to change. It seems like the Trace only affects the underage and provides very limited locational data

Aurors might use a different system independent of the Trace for tracking illegal activities. The aurors responded quickly to the murder of the Riddles however. I'm not sure if this is a different system or they used the information from the Trace on Riddle

** It's an occasional fanfic idea that the Taboo curse from DH was originally on the Morsmordre (Dark Mark) spell; alternatively on one of Unforgivables, and Voldemort only alters it to apply to his name.

*** How would the Ministry even know what the incantation for the Dark Mark is when it's cast over where murders happened (as in no witness)?
