So, I recently put out my second oneshot of about 3K words and I'd like to ask people to read it and give me constructive criticism. I'm writing these oneshots to try to improve my writing, so a review/comment would be greatly appreciated. Here are the links.

** Commented on Ao3 with some of my thoughts. It may seem harsh but it's mainly because I already expect a certain amount of quality from you by beta reading with you. Overall, it's pretty great and I hope you'll continue with even longer stories.

*** Thanks. I'd prefer harsh criticism. We learn from our mistakes after all.
