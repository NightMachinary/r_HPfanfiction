**** Well, to be fair, you did cast “linkjkro” and that's the kind of dark magic none of us has heard of before.

Also, there are quite a few stories with “Lucky Charms” being a part of the title or even the entirety of it. As such, I think you might want to link that one by the ID number rather than the name, or else whatever the bot links will be suspect.

****** Yeah, I'm fairly sure Madame Rowling chose the name for how ... luscious it feeled, yes.

You know, for what it's worth, I am wondering why, outside of certain fanfics, nobody mangles his name into “Lucy” or, heck, even “Lucifer”. I mean, people mangle my name often enough that it just feels weird to me ... though it might very well be because I both told them to feel free to have fun with my name and don't actually mind the results they gave me, so I might just be an outlier here.

**** The only other Lucky Charms I have seen was a pretty awfully written HP PJO crossover.
