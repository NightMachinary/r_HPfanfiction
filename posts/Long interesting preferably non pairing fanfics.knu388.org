** No pairings at all or just no non cannon/slash pairings? These stories don't focus on the pairing but there might be some James/Lily in them. Theyre story focused and over 100k.

linkao3(Remus Lupin and the Prisoner of Azkaban)

^{^} this is PoA from Remus's point of view. It's interesting and sad and a good insight into Remus learning how Sirius was innocent throughout the year. I really liked it.

linkao3(Swung by Serafim by Flamethrower).

^{^} this is a LONG story where Harry is obliviated in CoS (by Gilderoy) and subsiquently has to relearn everything. Harrys personality becomes a lot more rational and intelligent. Hes bonds with Snape (as Snape is also rational and intelligent) and they live through the next few books from that perspective. As far as I remember there's no pairings in this fic. They're certainly not the focus of there is. It's a critical look and commentary on the HP universe. They fix the school, a critical look at Dumbledore and Voldemort and the Ministry. Effectively they fix the universe. It's really interesting and very well researched. Flamethrower is an incredible author and I'd reccommend all their work.

I'm also linking [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/MarieKavanagh/pseuds/MarieKavanagh][Marie Kavanagh"s work]]. They write Black family stories (so Sirius growing up). No slash or pairings, mostly Sirius before Hogwarts stories. No bashing. They're really wonderful and a great insight into such a aristocratic family.

I hope these are ok?

  In 1993, Gilderoy Lockhart points a stolen wand at Harry Potter and Ron Weasley with the intent to Obliviate them.The wand doesn't backfire. Gilderoy's "discovery" of the Chamber of Secrets is a short-term success.Other consequences are not short-term at all.

** The linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) series is over a million words and counting. There might eventually be a pairing, and there's been an interesting fake relationship subplot, but mostly it's about Harry having a caring parental figure. Who's still a bit emotionally immature himself, but trying his best for James' son.

Also, the linkffn(Pureblood Pretense) series is an excellent AU where Tom Riddle launched a political party instead of a war, leading to a very different world where Harriett Potter has both her parents but is banned from Hogwarts because she's half-blood. Rich world building, original plot that weaves in canon elements while telling its own story, no character bashing, and a Harry who works hard for her goals but faces great challenges and danger. Over 1.3 million words, book four is nearly complete.

**** Ooh, trying to find something to compare to your favorites? No pressure...

I suppose there are some similarities in linkffn(The Arithmancer). Female lead character, expanded plot with lots of world building. It hews closer to canon, at least in book 1, and perhaps leans a bit too heavily into world building at the expense of plot in book 2, but overall I enjoyed it, and the series is complete.

Or linkffn(The Accidental Animagus), by the same author, which initially seems like it's just fixing everything from canon, but then it turns out that the villains have been level-grinding too. Sequel is not complete, but updated recently.

And linkffn(The Peace Not Promised) is a fairly slow-paced, character-focused fic; does that match what you wanted? It's very much about getting into Severus' head and unpacking how he behaves when given a chance to address his regrets. Incomplete but active and nearly finished.
