Yeah so this weirded me out the first time I saw it, but I'm seriously desperate for reading material. I think she sends the baby to him too.


** Was it Faith by sbmcneil? Bellatrix rapes Harry and several months later leaves the baby girl with him ( she wanted a boy). Ginny is understanding and helps him look after the baby. He had overheard Ron joking about men being raped so didn't confide in him. Sorry, didn't leave a link xx

  The cruel, beautiful smile, the predatory violet eyes of his torturer, lover and savior, Bellatrix Lestrange, ensnared him. Even after escape she became his sole obsession. To feel her touch again Harry will tear apart the Wizarding world, stone by stone.
