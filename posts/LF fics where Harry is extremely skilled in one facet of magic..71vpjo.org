Sort of like The Art Of Self Fashioning, I'm looking for any fic where Harry is extremely skilled in one school of magic, like a prodigy. I don't care about pairings or anything like that, I'd just like it to be good.

  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.

** linkao3(The Problem of Potions)... sort of? He's extremely dedicated to potions and pulls off neat things with them, but is nowhere near Snape's level (Snape considers him to be barely average but making up for it with sheer enthusiasm).

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

** linkffn(12125300) harry is extremely skilled with charms and very skilled with wards. he also has some form of perceiving magic that makes him feel sick if he is overwhelmed because a place is too magical, but also lets him see wards. the first couple chapter get time to get used to but the writing soon gets better

  Power is a fickle mistress. You court her for centuries, nourish her, shelter her from those who are unworthy, and everything is as it should be. But then, she laughs, stabbing you in the back with cold daggers of reckoning. Still, the Blacks aren't overly discouraged. They've been at this dance longer than anyone else, they know one thing for certain: an old flame never dies. AU
