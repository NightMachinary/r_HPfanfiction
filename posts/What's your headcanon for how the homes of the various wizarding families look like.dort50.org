I'll start: I picture the Greengrass family living in a (somewhat modernized) Roman villa. My headcanon is that their family descends from one of the equites that settled in Roman Britain during the 1st Century AD, so among other things their estate has a rather large stable for horses and similar creatures.


** I really want more wizards to live in houses like the Weasley's. With architecture that defies the laws of nature and are only standing because of magic. Though I imagine the wealthier, more sophisticated ones are less a hodge podge of add ons and more purposeful artistry.

** Some gets castles. Most rich ones have villas near their main cashcows like a forest of wandwoods, farms and some probably on top of a mountain with house elves grazing magical animals and climate specific magical plants. The common folk lives around muggles.

** Most live in relatively large houses, either out in the country where muggles are unlikely to disturb them, or hidden in a manner similar to â„–12. There's no reason not to when the only difference a qualified architect makes is aesthetic, just conjure some stone or wood and bolt extra rooms on wherever you please, maybe extend a few.

Few actually have sane architecture, there's a distinct lack of load bearing walls, rooms that are bigger on the inside, windows in the cellar that show the garden on the other side of the house, the larger ones have secret passages that couldn't actually fit, linking different floors without a hint of slope.
