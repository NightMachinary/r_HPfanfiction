The idea occurred to me (and I would like to know if anyone else had thought it up, because it's kinda obvious in retrospect) that magic might be the mysterious [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy][Dark Energy]] that puzzles physicists to this day: it's just random wild magic, and we Muggles haven't yet figured out that that's what it is because every time one of the physicists working on Dark Energy makes a breakthrough, Obliviators come in.


** There are two main ways that magic can be characterised.

If you characterise magic as part of a unitary system of rules governing the universe (i.e. magic is a part of the same natural world as the rules of physics, it's just unknown how they fit together), then magic would be some form of energy.

The alternative is to characterise magic as an essentially supernatural force, entirely separate from the "regular" workings of nature.

I feel like there are a lot of problems with the former, regardless of what you pick as the source of the energy.

The biggest problem is that, while magic sometimes behaves like a physical force, at other times it behaves in ways that would make its combination with the natural universe very strange. Consider the following items:

- "You cannot create food out of nothing" is a fundamental law of magic, despite "food" being a concept that is relative to humanity.

- An abstract human concept like a job position has enough magical reality to be the target of a curse.

- It would appear that transfiguring objects into other objects with a similar name (beetles into buttons, for example) is easier than other transfigurations (since it is used as a simple first step before moving onto other more difficult transfigurations).

- Wizards never seem to run out or run low on magic.

On top of the above, if magic is energy, then you quickly run into absurdities with regards to the quantity of it that wizards have. The problem is that wizards can create matter (transfiguration can increase a thing's mass, and transfiguration creates real physical matter). By the famous equation E = m . c^{2} this means that wizards have access to an /absurd/ amount of energy. To put it in context, a single Aguamenti Charm - something wizards can cast effortlessly - would involve more energy than the largest nuclear bomb ever detonated. And wizards can cast spells like this end to end without apparently ever feeling tired or beginning to run out of magic.

So yeah. For these reasons I think it is generally superior to consider magic in HP as a purely supernatural force which follows its own rules.

*** Your post makes a lot of assumptions. The biggest being that even if magic is a 'because I say so force'/'cheat code to the universe' rather than some unknown energy, it is still a part of the workings of the nature just from the fact that it exists and can be described, and with study can be understood. Even if what is observed is downright weird that doesn't make it 'not nature,' just look at quantum mechanics for instance.

The biggest problem I see with the latter explanation as it implies some very disturbing things about the nature of reality. Like living in the Matrix type of disturbing. Not that that's a fundamentally impossible proposition, it's just not an interpretation I think fits the Harry Potter universe's style and themes.

On the other hand, there are problems with your big problems. The biggest one being that we don't really know a whole lot about how magic actually works in the Harry Potter universe. Despite the setting being a school for magic, we see very little of what is actually being taught as the series focuses on Harry's adventures rather than his studies.

To start with we don't even know where magic comes from. Weather it com from inside each wizard or if they channel it from their surroundings or somewhere in between is completely unknown.

As for wizards not getting magically tired, we really don't have good data on this either as there isn't much to go on as far as instances of wizards using lots of magic in a short span of time along with the related aftermath. Most instances of magic use in the series are either relatively short or behind the scenes. We don't even really get so much as a training montage.

On to your more specific examples:

#+begin_quote
  "You cannot create food out of nothing" is a fundamental law of magic, despite "food" being a concept that is relative to humanity.
#+end_quote

We don't really know enough about how conjuring and transfiguration works to know if this is a hard limit or a soft limit. By which I mean is anything one may consider food completely unable to be produced, or could you create a cheeseburger for example but some other factor involved prevents it from providing nutrition or just makes it a really bad idea. If the case may be that conjured objects are just magical constructs it stands to reason that they would not function as a source of nutrition and if not all transfiguration are permanent then eating a transfigured cheeseburger would be an exceedingly bad idea. That's more than enough reason to teach eleven-year-olds 'you cannot do this.'

#+begin_quote
  An abstract human concept like a job position has enough magical reality to be the target of a curse.
#+end_quote

Nobody really knows how that particular curse functions, nor the Taboo which is somewhat related. It's not clear weather the idea is cursed or if there's some sort of area effect magic that detects 'The Defense Professor' and makes enough bad thing happen to them (like an inverse liquid luck) that they get dismissed.

#+begin_quote
  It would appear that transfiguring objects into other objects with a similar name (beetles into buttons, for example) is easier than other transfigurations (since it is used as a simple first step before moving onto other more difficult transfigurations).
#+end_quote

I frankly have no idea where you got that conclusion from. The way I see that lesson is that a) wizards are whimsical enough to just do that for no actual reason, b) its a matter of relative complexity where starting out making one simple object into another (matchstick to needle) then a more complex object into a simple one (beetle to button) and so on while using superficially similar objects (hedgehog and pincushion) to make it easier is a logical lesson progression.

**** Yes to practically everything you said. In the case of the "no food" rule, my theory is that most transfiguration makes up random matter that, while stable, only /resembles/ the caster's idea of what the end product should look and feel like. Only someone with an intimate knowledge of exactly what food is made of, down to the elementary particles, would get an edible result; just imagining the shape and consistency of a cheeseburger, and the taste of one, might result in a totally poisonous result. This is the same as how Conjured and Transfigured animals, in spite of behaving like real ones, are presumably not really "alive" and feeling (I dare hope so, anyway; it'd be just /disturbing/ if Hogwarts' curriculum required fourteen-years-old to Vanish - aka, kill - actual live kittens as mandatory schoolwork) /

*** - "You cannot create food out of nothing" I subscribe to the fanon that transfiguration is not permanent, and does not necessarily replicate all chemical and physical properties of target substance. You /can/ transfigure food, it will just kill you when it reverts. I understand Alchemy to be use of magic to rearrange matter on chemical or nuclear levels. Alchemic spells exist for food, kinda, you target, say, a bowl of gravy, and rearrange molecules in the air into random molecules in target. Is high-level magic, because if you mess up your concentration, and target wrong thing, you can poison yourself. Also, creating physical structures on the macro-molecular but still very tiny level is not a thing yet figured out. So you could replicate a a nice turkey dinner, if you're willing to drink random turkey slurry. This also takes a lot of energy, so unless you can tap a source other than yourself, this does not work for feeding you.
- For most magic to work, I already am presupposing that casting a spell involves making a... small and perhaps non-sentient spinoff your mind, that actively carries your intent out. The entire purpose of runes is to lock down this intent or maintain that copy for as long as possible. Sacrificial rituals in which a living thing is killed, its soul extracted, and enslaved to carry the will of the caster also might work.
- I understood that as being of similar mass and appearance, and even similar materials and physical properties. Needle into matchstick does not fit that theory - there too, it is similar mass and shape, so they only need to focus on two things - physical properties and details of shape.
- We see them getting tired, but in canon is indistinguishable from 'tired from waving my arms and running around all day'. Perhaps something like Inheritance's magic system, where you cast from the same energy source you run the mundane stuff on...
- Also, all the places where major casting happens are also places that are, well, very magical, so one would expect a high ambient magic level (Hogwarts, forbidden forest, Ministry of Magic. Only exception perhaps is Little Hangleton, and that was very short).
- I assume conjuration is transfiguration of air, and is difficult because of massive disparity in mass between a volume of air at sea level and the thing you are conjuring, and that there is not a morphing visualization you can use. Aguamenti is thus just transfigured air, and is dangerous to use, unless it is actually a summoning charm that summons nearby water and sprays it from wandtip. In this case, at Hogwarts it is drawn from the lake, and by the lake of the Inferi (after Dumbledore drinks the potion) summoned from the lake. The charm summons exactly water, so it is then an excellent way to obtain uncontaminated water. If used far from a source of water, you only have atmospheric water vapor to draw upon, and you then need insane power levels because of how large a volume of air you have to draw upon to get decent amounts of water, and then condense it, so the energy requirement shoots up.
- So, I prefer that magic energy source is either the body itself, or draw it from some alternate dimension with some kind of channeling cost or constraint. Otherwise, there's no reason I can't keep cast such a big Augamenti that there's so much water that it collapses into an unstable hypergiant that immediately goes supernova. That or transfigure a large volume of antimatter. It doesn't take that much to end life on earth. Every 11-year-old with even a basic science fiction novel background and a wand a walking doomsday weapon.

***** It nevers says /no/. It just never says yes, either. And for God's sake, why does anyone ever assume that what someone wrote in some book 500 years ago is actually the case? I mean "Can't transfigure food" could be a statement of impossibility or "Don't do this. It ends very badly."

For that matter, considering we're talking teenagers, including Ronald Weasley, Crabbe, and Goyle, I'd think it even prudent to outright lie to them rather than have certain people decide "screw the rules, I'm hungry now" and end up having random molecules in their cells turning into wood, or air, several hours later.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Contradicted by the Dursleys needing to get Dudley's pig tail removed surgically, wizards believing it is possible that Quintapeds were created by transfiguration, something which happened hundreds of years ago, and by logical deduction from what we do know for sure about transfiguration:

1. We know that transfiguration changes a thing's physical makeup at the most fundamental level (see below).

2. We know that in the absence of magical intervention, physical things do not spontaneously change into other physical things.

Conclusion 1. Transfiguration does not need to continuously maintain itself, because once the transfiguration is performed, there is no reason for it to revert unless fresh magic comes into play.

Conclusion 2. Transfiguration is permanent unless actively reversed.

#+begin_quote
  does not necessarily replicate all chemical and physical properties of target substance
#+end_quote

Contradicted by the definition of spell types, as well as direct word of god.

The entire definition of transfiguration (in contrast to Charms) is that it /does/ alter a thing at its most fundamental level, whereas a Charm merely modifies a thing's properties:

#+begin_quote
  Charm: Does not fundamentally alter the properties of the subject of the spell, but adds, or changes, properties. Turning a teacup into a rat would be a spell, whereas making a teacup dance would be a charm. The grey area comes with things like 'Stunning Spells', which on balance I think are Charms, but which I call spells for alliterative effect.”
#+end_quote

And word of god further backs this up by saying that transfiguration alters things at the molecular level:

#+begin_quote
  With a charm you add properties to something. With a transfiguration you change its nature completely; the molecular structure alters.”
#+end_quote

Another:

#+begin_quote
  I assume conjuration is transfiguration of air
#+end_quote

Contradicted by the description given by McGonagall in OotP - conjuration is the opposite of vanishing - in combination with the description of vanishing in DH - vanishing sends things into non-being. So conjuration is making things out of non-being, not the transfiguration of air.

So yeah. Like I say, fine for fanon, but definitely not canon.

Any such WOG or statement by a character in-universe is assumed to be a statement of what that character or author-avatar thinks is the case, and is not taken as actual in-universe fact.

For that matter, for my own work, I first construct a reasonably consistent set of rules for magic and its interaction with physics, by working backwards from my story parameters, then working forwards saying "if this is the case, then why is that not the case?" and repeating until major holes are removed.

Then as construct the societies of the world, I consider, given the laws, what conjectures would seem reasonable, what areas would be hard to play in, what rules of thumb look hard and fast, modelling from development of engineering and mathematical principles from rules of thumb and random guesses (i.e. Ancient-era elemental 'theories') that sounded good and explained what they saw more or less well enough without actually being right, identifying interesting areas that could be missed for protagonists to perhaps find, or even not.

To claim that one knows everything about one's universe, especially when one lacks the scientific and mathematical background to understand the implications of what one is saying is the very height of hubris, and tears at the greatness of the work.

Yeah, but then this whole discussion is completely and utterly irrelevant in relation to Harry Potter. I'm sorry, but you can define your fanon as you want, and no one will argue with that. However, if we want to discuss magic in relation to Harry Potter /canon/ we have no choice than to pay attention to the text and the author.

Taure has written a relatively popular document detailing how the magic in the potterverse might work, and it is a interesting topic in my opinion. HP is the most read work of modern literature, and analyzing how it portrays magic and its limits is in my opinion something rather interesting.

And it's great that this works for you. But to build your world differently is fine too, and that's what we are discussing here - a world build by such an author.

You made claims that make no sense in this system by the author, yet you insist that your system is somehow 'correct'. And yes, you do that:

Just that they should stick to handwaving and not try to define things in terms they don't understand. For the same reason that it is generally not recommended to use words that one does not well know the meaning of.

I am arguing for my right to this interpretation of canon being at least as valid as yours. It's just like law systems, in a way. There is a text, and then there are various ways of reading that text. As long as it's self-consistent within the language, you're basically ok. No interpretation that satisfies that is wrong, at most you have multiple valid and mutually exclusive interpretations.

I much prefer the formulation I presented due to my hobby for building laws of physics for fantasy worlds that I read.

If you prefer to hold the HP canon world in your mind differently, that's your right... and mine. Although, of course, it is quite fun to debate as we have so here done. :)

I do the same, but I like the challenge of actually including everything I read, and not selectively picking it. When Rowling says that transfiguration is permanent, isn't it a greater challenge to define your system so it works with that?\\

  * Spells
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: spells
    :END:
  A spell is such a fundamental alteration of reality. The easiest example is funnily enough the "Avada Kedavra"-Curse. Whatever (living something) it hits will just be /dead/ afterwards. It doesn't stop the heart, it doesn't fry your brain, and it doesn't snap the connection of your soul. It just makes you dead.

  As less dark example, the "Wingardium Leviosa"-Spell makes a thing fly. It is not defined in how counteracts gravity or makes an object lighter, no: It just makes the object fly. If it has to overcome a magnetic field or gravity doesn't make a difference - which ideed makes wizards all the more confused about magnets.

  The Reparo-Spell is a very interesting spell, as 'repaired' is a fundamentally subjective thing. Think a set of Lego bricks. Build a plane, drop it. Build a boat, drop it. Cast reparo. What will the result be?\\
  Buy a lego-set of a car, never assemble it, and cast reparo on the parts. What will the result be now?\\
  A real car with a broken headlight is parked. You drop a huge rock on it, and then levitate it away. If you cast /reparo/ on the car, it will repaired afterwards. But will the headlight work as well now?

  Indeed, a lot of maigcal theory taught at Hogwarts focuses on problems such as this. The answer to all of these is "It depends". This is also where "intent" comes in, but intent isn't the only thing that decides what happenes in the above examples.

Sure, except [[https://youtu.be/59iG_xo1eu0?t=76][this scene]] where a few wizards literally repair an entire city by lifting tons of steel. The Inheritance system doesn't really support that.

#+begin_quote
  In this case, at Hogwarts it is drawn from the lake, and by the lake of the Inferi (after Dumbledore drinks the potion) summoned from the lake.
#+end_quote

The whole point was that you *need* to use the lake water, and Aguamenti wouldn't work, because the water vanishes in the goblet.

#+begin_quote
  “Aguamenti!” he shouted, jabbing the goblet with his wand.\\
  The goblet filled with clear water; Harry dropped to his knees beside Dumbledore, raised his head, and brought the glass to his lips --- but it was empty. Dumbledore groaned and began to pant.

  “But I had some --- wait --- Aguamenti!” said Harry again, pointing his wand at the goblet. Once more, for a second, clear water gleamed within it, but as he approached Dumbledore's mouth, the water vanished again.

  “Sir, I'm trying, I'm trying!” said Harry desperately, but he did not think that Dumbledore could hear him; he had rolled onto his side and was drawing great, rattling breaths that sounded agonizing. “Aguamenti --- Aguamenti --- AGUAMENTI!”

  “Sir --- here!” Harry yelled, and lunging forward, he tipped the water clumsily over Dumbledore's face.

  The goblet filled and emptied once more. And now Dumbledore's breathing was fading. His brain whirling in panic, Harry knew, instinctively, the only way left to get water, because Voldemort had planned it so ...

  He flung himself over to the edge of the rock and plunged the goblet into the lake, bringing it up full to the brim of icy water that did not vanish.

So there seems to be a fundamental difference between the conjured water from Aguamenti and the lake water.

Indeed. Maybe Aguamenti water is conjured and thus different from "real" water for magical purposes... but it could also be theorized that the potion and lake-water were specifically enchanted by Voldemort so that only the latter could counteract the former, in which case even "real" bottled water a would-be-thief might have had on them coming in would not have saved them (which would have been a loophole in the protections otherwise). This might have been achieved by putting some additional component in the water, which ABZB's mechanics for Aguamenti would counteract, since it would only summon the H20 and not the additional component.

** I've actually been considering that for my worldbuilding for my fic.

Basically:

Q.Why do humans have mundanes and wizards, and every other species is either entirely magical or entirely mundane?

A.Really, (almost) every species is split like that. Many species have an extreme phenotype split.

Q. Since magic is so great, why is it not the case that every species is entirely magical, having outcompeted the mundanes?

A. Magic can neither be created nor destroyed (either it is a property of matter-energy, or magic is just a form of it, and thus falls under the matter-energy conservation law). The amount of magic available on Earth waxes and wanes, to the degree that most magical biologies either cannot function at all without sufficient ambient magic (i.e. dragon too heavy to fly, boggart cannot scare away predators, dementor not cause catatonia in prey) or they end up spending a ton of energy and biomass on structures that are useless without magic (i.e. dragon's wings are useless). Epigenetic regulation switches on and off magic-organelle-producing genes, based on stresses in environment and level of ambient magic in youth.

If dark energy or dark matter /are/ the ambient magic of my AU, then low-magic times are times when we are passing through an area where one or the other is less dense. However, then the magic should be interacting with itself and other matter via whatever force magic interacts with, and every observation we have IRL implies quite strongly that they only interact via gravity and possibly the weak nuclear force. So I need to construct either a very good reason for the ambient magic matter-energy to not interact outside of the presence of life, somehow, OR try to justify a universe that looks like ours, but dark matter and dark energy do have unexplained interactions, and since both of those things have MAJOR effects on the entire history of the entire universe (which is how we know that something is there at all in the first place)... That is not an easy task!

And the wizarding world(s) that I generally assume/construct have far too few people or understanding to even know about this, much less show up and obliviate and wipe computers.

**** Indeed.

I'm also building a small chart of what 'innate magics' given species have. Humans innate magics (which are the ones they can use wandlessly) are teleportation (Harry to top of school building in book 1), general reinforcement and repair of body (metamorphmagi, harry's hair regrowth, Neville bouncing), telekinesis (TMR), mind magics (legilimency and occlumency, multiple sources). Note that telekinesis can do many other things (create mundane fire by heating wood by rubbing its particles together, for example).

There are specific organelles or regenerable soft tissue structures per magic-thing. Whatever fundamental form of magic is is shaped like a protein by those structures. Evolution of magical abilities is just like evolution of proteins and enzymes.

Wands work by allowing wizard to push their magic into a thing that lets them shape custom proteins. Incantations are actually a biofeedback method to pump out the right magical monomers. Wand movements are to facilitate proper placement of monomers and fold the magic properly. With practice, both can be replaced by using one's own will (i.e. telekinesis) to manipulate the monomers directly as you spit them out of your wand.

Thus, wandless magic is extremely useful but inherently limited in scope.

The natural magical abilities of humans make sense, because our ancestors were Persistence Hunters [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_hunting]]. Teleportation fits with that perfectly. Mind magics arose from complex social competition for mates, growing hand in hand with evolution of intelligence. Telekinesis... not sure how to place that, but if only homo sapiens developed it.... that may be why we're the only member of our species left. it's that amazing a power.

I would expect the magical versions of our closest relatives (orangutans, chimpanzees, gorillas, etc.) to exhibit similar or related magics, produced in similar ways.

The increased intelligence of 'familiar' species /might/ be from mind or soul links to their wizard, OR perhaps magic is somehow... friendly towards higher intelligence. Humanity is special in that our non-magicals are also as sentient and intelligent as our magicals... which would explain, actually, why in a world where there are other sapients who are our physical superiors and also have magic, humanity seems to have driven everyone else into near-extinction or hiding...

***** *Persistence hunting*

Persistence hunting (sometimes called endurance hunting or cursorial hunting) is a hunting technique in which hunters, who may be slower than their prey over short distances, use a combination of running, walking, and tracking to pursue prey until it is exhausted. Grey wolves, African wild dogs, spotted hyenas, lungless spiders, and humans are adapted to using this hunting strategy. A persistence hunter must be able to run a long distance over an extended period of time.

Humans are the only surviving primate species who practice persistence hunting.

** Ha, that's clever. Dark energy is supposedly a property of space, so it is everywhere. Perhaps magic is what happens when humans with the gift to channel this energy use that gift.

It does seem to deminish the mystery of it somewhat, but on the other hand, the only thing scientists even "know" about dark energy is that something's needed to explain the expansion of space and they just gave it that name. They haven't even come close to understanding it, they haven't even really discovered it, they just inferred that /something/ needed to be there within the current models.

**** Found it! And it's not too bad. It's a Tony is Harry's father story. The science/magic explanations are good. One of the things that irks me about Avengers crossovers is when an electronic more complicated than a toaster is touched by a magical person and it gets fried, but in the latest update of this story, that phenomenon is explained in a way that's more satisfactory than any other story like this has done. My biggest problem with the story is the grammar, but this latest chapter was better. Also, there's some Dumbledore bashing and Indie!Harry, but all things considered it's been pretty light. There is Genius!Harry, but considering Tony is his dad, it doesn't feel forced.

As for the reason you started this thread, magic as dark matter is explained and we see electricity being converted into magic/dark matter, although the how isn't really explained.

No, it isn't. Fantastic Beasts claims that Magical is an internal thing within Wizards that can be suppressed. If it was an outside force, there'd be no reason why you can't just have the whole population be Wizards, or why being a Squib is a thing. Magic isn't simply something Wizards channel, that is a fanon concept.

No, she's gone on record saying that she isn't a Wicca or Satan worshiper, etc ... She has never said that there are no people that practice Wicca at Hogwarts, as that's an idiotic thing to say, especially in a moderately large population like the Wizarding World's (10% of the Muggle populace is still large).

Comparing Magical Cores to simply saying that Wizards have Magic flowing through their body that they can both create and deplete if overused is not the same.

And while you may have a point on the subject of wizards' magic being suppressed, it has been proven againa nd again on this sub that nothing in canon supports the idea of magic being depleted if you overuse it. The only examples of that are either caused by a Dementor being around (which is a completely different thing), or in cases where the characters are probably just plain old tired because running around while waving a stick takes its toll on the human metabolism.

Also, the way she sets apart Wiccans makes me think the emphasis is very much intentional, to stress "Wiccans at Hogwarts make no sense".

Of course, your argument that Wiccans may coexist outside of the wizarding community is still valid and could be the premise of a fic... but it does invalidate your initial point, which was, as you'll recall, that how power works in Wiccan belief was a good indication for how it might work in the /Harry Potter/ universe.

And here's why you should pay some attention to Word of God. Salem /Institute/ for Witches (it's Institute, not School) is actually /not/ a school, but a feminist institute, as Rowling revealed. The American school of witchcraft is Ilvermorny, and it has nothing whatsoever to do with the Salem Witches Trials (about which, incidentally, it's stated in some additional materials that they convicted more muggles than witches, as the true witches just Apparated away before their trial) or Wicca beliefs.

Wicca is pretty prevalent in North America and England. The idea that not a single person that practices it got into Hogwarts is absurd. Do you want to know where Wicca is most common in America? Salem.
