  Thestrals can go a lot more places than just wherever you need to go. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, Voldemort is more than aware of this, and doesn't want to deal with Harry Potter anymore.

  A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  As Master of Death, Harry can't really die. What he can do is get reborn, in an alternate dimension that is so much like his old world but so different at the same time. Taking down Voldemort again? Bring it on. MoD Harry

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

** Knew the 1st and the 3rd but I've never run into the 2nd so thanks. The only one that fits your description that I remember good enough to give you the titel is this one linkffn(0800-Rent-A-Hero) though I will admit theres no interaction in the first five chapters, probably more (got bored by then).

Hmm I'm pretty sure you've read linkdlp(Harry Potter and The Boy Who Lived by The Santi) linkffn(Harry Potter and The Boy Who Lived by The Santi) if you've read those others, if not It's close enough to what you seek, I think.

I also vaugely remember another one where Harry ended up in another universe after lying under the influence of verasetium(?) and then he claimed that his name was Colin Creevy. And it ended up weird where several proffesers had to enter his mindscape and help him out of a coma... It was rather weird but I think it fits your description.

Edit: I totally forgot, Silver&Agias 's Harry Potter and The Girl Who Lived and all the fanfictions written to /that/ fanfiction.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

Iknow of one more that exist, but it was mearly the original copy pasted and with some 8000 to 12000 words put on the end that doesn't really contribute. Couldn't find the link to that one, maybe the auther took it down.

Holy shit this is a great story. I was going to dismiss it because of the ridiculous title, but I'm glad I gave it a shot. Thanks for the recommendation.

If you remember the name of the fic you mentioned let me know, or if you think of anything else in this genre.
