In the books,goblins were shown as untrustworthy and frankly,disgusting beings. Who were quite selfish and biased... Yet many fanfics show them as a shorter and richer form of Tolkien's elves.only a few fanfics show them as they were supposed to be like in that fic where Harry becomes a dark lord for his godson...I forgot it's name but anyway...goblins are not cool,period .show them as neutral if you want to but not as some charity workers rescuing others from their destruction


** Actually, in the books the goblins were shown as beings that didn't like their time wasted but were not nasty in any way. They were not, in fact, impolite to their customers---that's complete fanon. There was ONE goblin who proved to be nasty and untrustworthy.

*** This. I find it rather problematic to relegate an entire species as 'bad' due to one goblin's actions (Griphook). They're an entire species of people, they have to be more than (if you even want Gringotts to be this way) 'greedy bankers'.

There are likely goblin farmers who farm fungus like D&D dwarves, miners, healers, and teachers, and more.

I don't mind 'helpful goblins', though it's not my usual preference. I like 'neutral goblins'. They do their jobs. If you pay them, they follow the contract. They aren't going to be uber-helpful for no reason, but aren't going to be uber-unhelpful either. That's bad for business.

If you piss them off, they'll follow a contract by the letter and stiff you (basically what Griphook did for little reason 'cept he was a jerk). If you don't, they'll simply do their jobs and follow a contract fairly. If you impress them (and no, not by just being polite like in many fanfics) they might be willing to help you.

*** That's the thing, we were shown only one goblin's perspective,who was polite or at least neutral to Harry the first time he visited gringotts,but then his behaviour changed drastically

** I think a lot people got made uncomfortable at the notion of writing a race of short, greedy, biased, greasy, big-nosed bankers.

** It's probably a trope that got a life of it's own and overwrote some people's memories of canon.

"What is Goblin culture actually like, what if they were helpful in some circumstances?" Would be a fairly interesting prompt if it wasn't already so prevalent in the fandom.

** Well, there was this theory that Rowling was writing them as the steoreotypical jews... So in that light, writing them negatively does leave quite unfortunate implications.

*** Book Goblins don't really draw any parallels to Goblins in my opinion, in the film on the other hand...

** I always liked the thought that they were greedy and untrustworthy, with the exception being contracts. They *always* stick to contracts they make, even if that means interpreting some of the wording to their advantage.
