Something like in linkffn(13123652).

Just incase the bot doesn't work again: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13123652/1/Ingenio-ab-Artifex-Formerly-Flowers-for-Your-Grave]]

Like I said in the title, no slash or smut. I'd prefer completed or work in progress fics, but if it's really well written, then abandoned, I might read it anyway.


** Story: Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13230340/53]]

Has quite a bit of weirdness, but I love Harry's relationship (not slash) with Dumbledore, and Dumbledore for that matter in this one, I wish more authors would go in this direction for Dumbledore actually.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13388022/1/Albus-and-Harry-s-World-Trip]]

In this fic, Mcgonagall expels Harry for rushing into the Chamber of Secrets and Dumbledore (who was removed as Headmaster by the Board of Governors) becomes Harry's private tutor. Dumbledore is quite jovial and yet he knows a lot of arcane magics, just like the first four books.

  There have been many rumours surrounding me and my life---especially my love life. So, after due consideration---and a few well-aimed words from our resident bookworm---I have decided to publish my autobiography. For any questions and questionable charms placed on your copy of my self-updating autobiography, feel free to owl my publisher, Jaime.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.
