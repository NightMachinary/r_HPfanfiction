** People knew there were Weasleys at Hogwarts, even knew there were several in fourth year, but no one was sure how many there were.

Most people agreed there were at least two, though several Slytherins insisted they'd been attacked by a gang of five and Luna Lovegood maintained that there weren't any, just a very lonely Dabberblimp trying to make lots of friends.

The professors had noticed seeing "a few Weasleys" in every fourth year class.

Professor McGonagall could distinctly recall having to separate a Slytherin and Gryffindor Weasley after a brawl started over which was more handsome. She'd been taken aback when they were joined in their detention by a Hufflepuff Weasley, this one actually looking rather abashed at her scolding. Still, there were so many Weasleys, she supposed she could have overlooked one in the commotion.

Professor Snape was nearly at his wits end. It seemed like every corner he turned another Weasley was waiting, trying very hard not to look suspicious, which he found extremely suspicious. One morning, he'd come very close to cursing a pair after he noticed them following him through the dungeons. They'd insisted they were simply on their way to breakfast from the Slytherin common room, which he'd also been suspicious of. Then the menaces had had the nerve to ask if he was feeling well, something so suspicious he'd immediately reported it to the headmaster.

Hagrid, meanwhile, was overjoyed to have a few students taking a real interest in magical creatures. He'd been pleased when Harry, Ron, and Hermione had been in his first class, but he can tell they were more interested in supporting him than in the creature he showed them. Those Weasleys though, had been great helps, particularly in his first class. He wouldn't admit it but even he'd had some doubts about being able to wrangle an entire herd of Hippogriffs on his own. When a veritable horde of those Weasley boys had turned up ready, willing, and surprisingly able to help he'd been happy to accept, even if their spurred boots and wide brimmed hats were a bit outlandish.

Fred and George were finding the whole thing very exhausting, but it was a happy exhaustion, rather like a Quidditch match that had gone on for too long. Their jinxes and potions had kept the students and teachers from giving too much thought to the number of Weasleys in fourth year, or what house they belonged in, but the plan would never have come together if they hadn't overheard Professor McGonagall explaining Time Turners to Hermione. After that it had been easy to 'borrow' the little bauble from Hermione. All they had to do was remember to go back in time and put it back after their prank was done. She hadn't ever noticed it was even missing, so they knew they'd be able to get away with it.

Still, even if time travel wasn't draining them magically, tranfiguring bugs into copies of themselves then putting compulsions on them to act in a certain way wasn't easy. As the twins got more and more tired their compulsions got weaker too. The last one Fred had cast barely worked at all. Fortunately, no one had questioned why a Slytherin Weasley 'twin' was crawling around the dungeons carrying a loaf of bread in it's mouth. Even Snape had started to ignore Weasleys when he saw them...exactly as planned.

** I think that in linkffn(10851278) the main character, a metamorphmagus, pretends to be a third weasley twin for a joke. But I could confuse that with a different story

*** You have the right story. It first happens in chapter 4.

Based on the first five chapters, though, I wouldn't recommend that anyone read the story. It has a Gary Stu, flat characters, and poor grammar. Even the author warns people not to read it at the top of the first chapter.

** In chapter 4 of linkao3(6996898), there is an incident involving poly juice that involves more than just the two twins. If you do decide to read, you will probably want to read the chapters before as well for context.

  “Scared Potter?” Malfoy sneered, and Harry snapped. He was done, finished, fed up with playing the innocent little Gryffindor with no common sense and a microscopic amount of intelligence. He rolled his eyes.“Why yes Malfoy, I'm terrified, can't you see me quaking in my boots? You, a second year child armed with a stick is the scariest thing I've ever seen. Please, please don't fatally injure me in front of three hundred witnesses and two teachers with your mean words and nasty smiles. Whatever shall I do?” The entire hall fell silent and Malfoy gaped. Harry smirked. Lockhart looked entirely bemused, and he thought Snape might be holding back a laugh.Harry spent his first year hiding his intelligence and playing the role of the Boy Who Lived. However Lockhart and Malfoys' combined presence finally causes him to snap, and chaos ensues from there.
