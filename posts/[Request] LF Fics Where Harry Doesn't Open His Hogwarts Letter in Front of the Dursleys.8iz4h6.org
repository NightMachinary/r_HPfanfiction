I'm not even sure if such a story exists, but it's a pretty popular opinion in the fandom that Harry was dumb to open his Hogwarts letter at the breakfast table. I want to read a story where circumstances are different and he waits until he's alone in his cupboard before opening the letter and how that changes the sequence of events. Canon rehashes are okay, but if the story deviates from canon that's fine too. I also don't mind if it's a time travel fic. Obviously it goes without saying that I'm looking for something well-written!


** Alternatively: He grabs one off the floor instead of trying to get them from the air when they are flying in through the chimney. (Wait, that did happen in the books right? I'm like 80% sure it did, but it's been like a year or 2 since I've read them)

*** He didn't do that in either the book or the film IIRC. It seemed such an obvious thing to do in the movie scene though. I remember my sisters would always scream at the TV that he should have just snagged a letter off the ground haha. I would also love a fic where he does just that, as long as he opens his first Hogwarts letter without the Dursleys being around I'm not too picky!

  Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one.

I don't mind if the end result is the same as canon and he just ends up shopping with Hagrid. I think there are endless possibilities that don't involve manipulative!Dumbledore.

***** I think even at 10 years old Harry was perceptive to know that any letter that had been addressed to him would be confiscated by the Dursleys who are super paranoid about how people perceive Harry as a member of their household. I don't think it's far-fetched at all that Harry would know that the people who don't give him the autonomy of having his own bedroom and or owning his own clothing would not allow him to open his own letter.

  sends a reply back by owl
#+end_quote

tfw you realize he has no owl or way to get an owl.

If I had to come up with how it could change things, Harry confronts them and they reluctantly allow Harry to go to Diagon, which Petunia knows about iirc, and even if she doesn't that isn't exactly a big retcon. She would also know about owls. This is pretty unlikely(more likely they try to 'stamp the magic out of him' but hey), but if it happened it would cause some pretty big changes. Namely, Harry would have no idea about the package Hagrid gets, leading to no connection between the 3rd floor and the package, so he doesn't confront Hagrid (Who he doesn't even know, really). In fact, Hagrid would get in trouble because of Norbert, since Harry & co can't get him out of that because they don't know Harry. And that means they don't get detention. So they don't encounter Quirrel in the Forest. So Quirrel ultimately gets to the Mirror and has no interference... followed by him being stumped, and Dumbledore goes and beats him up. So really, him hiding the letter could lead to him having a relatively normal year. But probably not, because the Dursleys caving to Harry is fairly unlikely. Though maybe a confrontation followed by the letter bombardment would make it more plausible? Like, when the letters show up at the hotel, they're like "screw this, let's toss him to the wizards and get our life back" and get him his stuff.

***** I like the scenario you created haha!

When I said he sends his reply back by owl I guess I was thinking of once the house had been swamped with owls later on after the Dursleys confiscated the first letter. For that to happen I guess he would've had to open his letter at breakfast after all.

******** He was sent in canon because the letters were kept from him. It took several days, up to a week I think, before his birthday. There isn't any real reason to wait that long, but I suppose it could be. Anyway, if you're writing this, why would you /want/ to force events to happen like they did in canon? I would prefer an unlikely (but possible) event that changes the story to a likely one that keeps things the same.

********* My point is that this is a ridiculous prompt for any meaningful point of departure. It's exclusively used in fics where Hagrid is there as an agent of Manipulative!Dumbledore to trick Harry from going into Slytherin so he stays 'meek' and 'compliant' and never reaches his full potential. Usually its because McGonagall or Snape or Flitwick or whoever comes realizes that Dumbledore is evil and will involve a lot of him justifying his actions as 'The Greater Good', with the caps.

By pointing out that this prompt will get nothing more than a canon rehash I'm advocating against doing so.

********** I mean, yeah it's kind of a weird place to depart from canon, but I don't see why it has to be used exclusively used in manipulative!Dumbledore fics. On a related note, how does going to Gryffindor result in him becoming 'meek'? lmao. Compliant, sure. Meek? Not a chance.

It could easily result in a canon rehash, but it doesn't /have/ to. Granted, it won't make a huge difference immediately, but over a long period of time it could certainly cause a large difference as long as the author isn't /trying/ to keep it a canon rehash. Let me make a scenario where it doesn't result in a canon rehash. I'll specifically have Dumbledore /not/ evil, though maybe a bit manipulative. I haven't decided, really.

Year 1: Harry Potter and the (Relatively) Normal Year at Hogwarts Harry doesn't open letter at breakfast. Wonders how he's going to get owl. Owl shows up. Replies asking wtf is going on. Mcgonagall shows up to explain, cows Dursleys when they try to stop him from going. This is 4-7 days before canon going to Diagon, depending on how long it took the owl to get to Hogwarts. Depending on how the author wants things to play out, Mcgonagall can also take the Stone from the vault, which I'll say happens; this will have repercussions later. He /could/ also meet some future Slytherin, allowing him to get a better view of the house, potentially letting him join, but I'll say that doesn't happen, partially because his view of Slytherin would probably still be bad from Malfoy on the train... maybe. Let's just assume his trip to Diagon has nothing happen during it, for the sake of 'least possible deviation from canon' just to show how /easy/ it is to make this depart from canon. Now, Harry gets his ticket from Mcgonagall but wait! it says "Platform 9 & 3/4, what in the world? If only he had a way to ask Mcgonagall, who has left already... oh wait, he knows he can summon owls. So he owls Mcgonagal/someone else at Hogwarts about the train and they explain things to him. Now he doesn't need to talk to the Weasleys, though that may happen regardless, so that stuff may not happen. Unless Ron doesn't show up at Harry's compartment I don't see much changing on the train, and the Sorting goes normally. In fact, things progress as is normal, except that he doesn't know Hagrid. (The following events may be out of order; been a while since I've read PS) He beats the Troll. Hagrid gets in trouble due to Norbert, since the trio don't know Hagrid. They don't get detention. They don't meet Quirrel. The Stone was already removed from the vault some time before Quirrel broke in; the news article doesn't mention that, except that the vault had been emptied(As opposed to saying "The vault was emptied 4 days previously", because that isn't as obvious as the same day. So they just say the vault that was broken into was empty/emptied). Harry makes no connection between the package Mcgonagall picked up, the third floor corridor, and the robbery. He does not hear about Flamel from Hagrid. The year ends without incident... from Harry's perspective. Quirrel does indeed make it to the end of the challenges without issue... this is where you can really choose to diverge. You have several choices. Choice one, most likely, Dumbledore arrives in time to stop Quirrel, expelling Voldemort from him and killing Quirrel in the process. Choice two, Voldemort just steals the Mirror from Hogwarts. This, probably, would cause by far the quickest divergence, as he will inevitably figure the mirror out, likely before summer ends. This leads to Voldemort returning in second year and I'm sure you can see why that's a big divergence. Choice three, AKA Plan 'everything gets better' has Dumbledore beating Voldemort, but instead of simply expelling him from Hogwarts the whole final room was an elaborate trap for Voldemort. The Mirror was the bait, and it alerted him when Quirrel entered the room, so he started heading back. He caught Quirrel in time, and then used the room to trap Voldemort's spirit, forming either a pseudo-Horcrux or just a ritual circle with Voldemort's free flying spirit inside. Ironically this doesn't actually change much, in the short run. Regardless of which of the three options you choose, Harry's had a pretty normal year, all things considered. Sure, he ran into a Cerberus and a Troll, but he didn't even have to battle the Dark Lord!

Year 2: Harry Potter and the Variable Year Based On What Ending You Chose (I'll be putting less detail in these, I think)(And I won't go past year 2, I think this is plenty to show how easily canon can diverge)

Choice One: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Literally the same as canon. Okay, there's almost certainly something that would have changed, but I don't particularly feel like finding it. Maybe since they don't know Hagrid, they don't figure out the Basilisk, but Hermione did it without Hagrid I think. Or did she need the hint about the spiders? If they don't figure it out, then Harry dies. The end. Voldemort wins. Riddle comes back to life. If they figure it out, I think things shouldn't change, though Harry wouldn't be as good at bantering with Riddle, since he hadn't defeated Quirrel the year before. I'll admit this option isn't the one you want to pick to not have a canon rehash. Actually, I just thought of a way for "good" to win. After Harry's death there's a redemption arc for Riddle and then he fights Voldemort lol. The Power He Knows Not was dying to a Horcrux :O. Hmm, yeah I just thought of how things would change. Harry heard Dumbledore saying that help will always be given in Hogwarts at Hagrids IIRC, so he wouldn't hear it(Dumbledore wouldn't even say it, really). Dumbledore /should/ find some other way to sneak it in, but you could say he fails somehow, and Harry goes down thinking he'll have no aid. He dies for sure.

Choice 2: Harry Potter and the Return of Voldemort (But still a relatively normal year at Hogwarts for Harry). Voldemort returns during the summer and calls his Death Eaters. Dumbledore assembles the Order of the Phoenix. Voldemort stops Lucius' foolish plan with the Diary; no Chamber of Secrets opening. Dumbledore does not gain his suspicions on Horcruxes. Voldemort begins subverting the Ministry and Dumbledore guards the Prophecy. Harry starts getting his dreams, but he doesn't know about Voldemort so he just thinks they're nightmares. Dumbledore, not suspecting Horcruxes, may personally tutor Harry in Occlumency. He may also tell Harry about Voldemort's return.

Choice 3: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Same as Choice 1, really. It's after year 2 that things begin to diverge from this choice, what with Voldemort being captured, so I'll just have year 3 here. Everything is normal, yay. But then Scabbers runs away, oh nooo. Except that the trio don't know Hagrid. So Scabbers is there to stay. Oh well. You have three choices: choice 1 is to have him just stay there. Nothing happens. Probably he wouldn't choose this, know Sirius is looking for him. Choice 2: Pettigrew runs, and Sirius catches him. Sirius kills him. Lupin breaks in either before or after, but regardless helps him. Maybe Sirius can get free with truth potion, memories, and Pettigrew's body. But probably not. Choice 3: Pettigrew escapes and jack shit happens. Voldemort is trapped, so he can hardly find him. Year 4: Harry watches the Triwizard Tournament, Krum wins. Year 5: Harry takes his OWLS. Year 6: Harry studies for his NEWTS, possibly with the Half Blood Prince's book. Year 7: Harry takes his NEWTS.\\
YEAR ??? Voldemort escapes his imprisonment and the war begins anew. At this point, Dumbledore may have destroyed the Horcruxes, but probably not. Dumbledore's death may have been the catalyst to Voldemort's escape, so either Dumbledore found the Horcruxes and the Ring killed him, or this is some 150 years in the future. Voldemort is killed by a laser rifle to the forehead lmfao. Or not, your choice really. 150 years is a hell of a long time to change the setting, though.

This stuff is all off my memory of the books, so some of the things may be inaccurate, but note that in every case I chose the thing that would cause the /least/ divergence, aside from Mcgonagall being the one who brought him to Diagon. And you saw how much things changed regardless. It would be trivial to change things up a bit more and cause an even larger change. Edit: Well, aside from the multi-choice part. And since I only went to year 2 on the most likely path, that looks much like a canon rehash. But after year 2, things change because Sirius kills Pettigrew.
