Ive never seen any theory/fanfic of this, but dumbles hiring lockhart solely because he bats for the other team would be hilarious


** McGonagall : Albus, Lockhart, seriously ?

Dumbledore : Well, he is the only one that applied...

McGonagall : Don't give me that crap ! You could as well as asked Arabella. He is as useless in defense as she is.

Dumbledore : Sure, but he is way nicer to look at, don't you think ?

** There's a Pottermore page on this! [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/gilderoy-lockhart]]

The relevant paragraphs:

"Many staff were baffled as to the reason that Albus Dumbledore chose to invite Gilderoy Lockhart back to Hogwarts as Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. While it was true that it had become almost impossible to persuade anybody else to take the job (the rumour that it was cursed was gathering strength both inside and outside Hogwarts), many teachers remembered Lockhart as thoroughly obnoxious, whatever his later achievements.

Albus Dumbledore's plans, however, ran deep. He happened to have known two of the wizards for whose life's work Gilderoy Lockhart had taken credit, and was one of the only people in the world who thought he knew what Lockhart was up to. Dumbledore was convinced that Lockhart needed only to be put back into an ordinary school setting to be revealed as a charlatan and a fraud. Professor McGonagall, who had never liked Lockhart, asked Dumbledore what he thought students would learn from such a vain, celebrity-hungry man. Dumbledore replied that ‘there is plenty to be learned even from a bad teacher: what not to do, how not to be'."

*** This only further exemplifies why Dumbledore was such a terrible administrator. He consistently prioritized his complicated grand plans over keeping his students safe and ensuring they receive a good education. He put someone else who he KNEW had no business in a school in a position of power and authority, and it is only by sheer dumb luck that it didn't result in Harry & Ron completely losing their memories, Ginny dying, and Diary!Mort's return to a body.

*** I was listening to Binge mode Harry Potter podcast and they have a great theory that compliments this Pottermore page! They were analyzing that Dumbledore new Gilderoy was a fraud but hired him in order to show people (namely Harry) how fame can corrupt someone.

** I don't think so.

I think Dumbledore was attracted to Grindalwald because he was his intellectual and magical equal first and all other factors were secondary to those two things.(close seconds but always behind the intellectual and magical equal factors)

If Grindalwald had been a girl who was Dumbledore intellectual and magical equal I think he would have been just as attracted to them.(But that is just how I read Dumbledore's Attraction to Grindalwald.)
