It seems like Jily is a beacon for this, unfortunately. H/G too, to a lesser extent, although I think it's because most fics about them are set straight after the war.

No pure smut, please.


** Ah, melodrama and excessive angst. Where will we be without you? In a much better place, probably.

The kind of fic you're looking for is rather rare, unfortunately. Most romance stories are either rom-coms or are gratuitously angsty. I would suggest linkao3(8941561) by Annerb. It is a well-written romance, if somewhat trope-y. St Margarets also has fluffy-ish daily life stories; [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?action=printable&textsize=0&sid=4384&chapter=all][Magic Within, Magic Without]] is my favorite of the lot.

If you like more rom-com-esque stories (which I occasionally do), then Firsts - linkffn(4958055), and [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?action=printable&textsize=0&sid=128876&chapter=all][Win a Date with Ginny Weasley]] are two of the more amusing ones.

For James/Lily, everything by cgner is quite good. linkffn(10949674) does have a red flag in the summary with the whole teenage pregnancy thing, but the James/Lily/Harry family dynamics in the future is quite well done.

  Harry and Ginny experience a series of "firsts" together. What are friends for, right? Fun and fluff and some last chapter steaminess. Rated M for final chapter only.
