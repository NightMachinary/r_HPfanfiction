Not trusting anyone, paranoid as fuck, because they really are out to get him. No mentor Snape crap, or loveable Death Eater children, they still hate Harry, but he's easier to access, and he doesn't have Gryffindor support. Harry learns to trap his bed so anyone who tries to hurt him gets maimed, learns defensive and counter spells fast, and practices Constant Vigilance, and Hogwarts is basically another form of Hell for him. He doesn't let his guard down when he goes to the Dursleys either.

Not Dark/Evil/Let'sfuckvoldemortpileofcrap Harry, but Jaded, Paranoid, If I let my guard down I'll die so my guard is NEVER down sort of Harry.

Ideally no pairing, but definitely no slash (So many Slytherin Harry fics are Harry x Death Eater, Harry x Voldemort, or Harry x Daphne, and I don't want Harry to have support in Slytherin or to be some evil freak that wants to bang Voldemort)


** The Many Deaths of Harry Potter linkao3(10093553) His paranoia isn't /just/ from sorting Slytherin, but that certainly doesn't help. Whenever he dies, he resets. Between knowing that these specific situations will kill him and knowing how seemingly innocuous situations can kill him, he's a paranoid little firstie with a bezoar in his pocket - and it only gets worse.

  In a world with a pragmatic, intelligent Voldemort, Harry discovers that he has the power to live, die and repeat until he gets it right.

** Not Slytherin Harry, or in Hogwarts, but he Out-Moodys Moody. Humor.

*Harry Potter and the Power of Paranoia* - linkffn(8257400)\\
Harry's paranoia stat suffers from stack underflow once he leveled up upon reaching the Dursleys for the summer after fourth year. (Yes, that's hyperbole, this isn't a gamer fic)

He hatches a plan, makes his escape to America and lives a highly paranoid life. Knowledge fidelius with an obvliviated muggle, backup wands for his backup wands, new identity, super wards.

  "You could be great, you know. It's all here in your head. And Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, there's no doubt about that."- The Sorting Hat.***Harry Potter was no ordinary boy. For one thing, no one in all of Privet Drive had any idea that he existed. For his whole, eleven years he'd been locked away in the confines of the house, stuffed in the cupboard under the stairs like an old umbrella that the Dursleys would just like to forget about. For another, he was a wizard. As strange and outlandish as that sounded, it was true. He's ready to make a new home at Hogwarts, though. Without any preconceived notions about the school or its Houses, he's sorted into Slytherin and makes fast friends with Draco Malfoy. But, how will this change the Boy-Who-Lived's story?
