Not exactly Over Powered, those tend to be old real quick, but just more cautious, after dealing with Voldemort and his Death Eaters.

I don't want him crazy smart, but maybe a bit smarter than in canon, he questions things more, and tries looking for answers more, but is cautious about it.

Would rather not be Slytherin Harry stories, I'd like to see Gryffindor Harry do these things.

Maybe he tries the mirror that Sirius gave him, maybe he goes to someone else other then McGonagall for help, in first year, maybe he does this or that slightly differently. Would rather not have Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione if possible

Would rather not have Dumbledore or Weasley bashing, if possible

Would rather it be completed, if possible

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash
