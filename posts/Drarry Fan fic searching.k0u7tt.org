I think it was either on Wattpad or Fanfic. Drarry fan fiction where Draco has some creature inheritance . And Harry turns out to be his mate but if Harry rejects him, he can die. There is some bonding thing between them . Draco can see different magic auras or something, Draco and Harry have sane colour auras. Draco has a separate quarters. The Malfoys betray the Voldemort to protect Harry. Draco's dad dies protecting him. Oh Draco has wings. I don't remember which creature Draco is but not a Veela. No character bashing in the story. It is Vitae or Veritas or something. I don't remember . Completed story. Of anyone finds it can you please link it below. Thank you
