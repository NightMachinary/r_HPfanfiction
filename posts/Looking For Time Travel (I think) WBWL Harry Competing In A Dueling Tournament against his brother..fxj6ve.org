As I said, I'm pretty sure he's time traveled, and I think his brother did as well. His brother had already time traveled once and messed it up, and death (?) decided to give Harry the chance. Harry was in prison, framed for the Chamber of Secrets iirc before he time traveled. His brother was convinced Harry was evil. They both competed in a dueling tournament in Hogwarts where they went up against people from higher years until I think they beat the 7th years and faced each other? If anyone could help me, that'd be great.


** “Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches” I think
