** I'm not sure they even know there's such a thing as "electronics".

I don't find it particularly funny. Please-men, eckeltricity, firelegs, whatever. It's just a sign of complete disregard of anything muggle. They don't even try. The muggle "expert" is completely clueless.

Which reminds me of the Quidditch World Cup.

  ‘Help me, Harry,' he muttered, pulling a roll of Muggle money from his pocket and starting to peel the notes apart. ‘This one's a -- a -- a ten? Ah yes, I see the little number on it now ... so this is a five?'

  ‘A twenty,' Harry corrected him in an undertone, uncomfortably aware of Mr Roberts trying to catch every word.

  ‘Ah yes, so it is ... I don't know, these little bits of paper ...'

You're not even trying, Mr. Weasley. No wonder your salary is so low. You are completely incompetent. The only reason you got the job is that nobody else wanted it.

And then there's Mr. Roberts, the site manager.

#+begin_quote
  Once out of earshot of Mr. Roberts, he muttered to Mr Weasley, ‘Been having a lot of trouble with him. Needs a Memory Charm ten times a day to keep him happy.'

The self-centered arrogance is staggering. It's straight out racism. They have a nice bit of segregation going on, too.

**** There was one I read where, IIRC, Sirius had gotten a trial before the World Cup, and was discussing how bad Muggle prejudice had gotten with Amelia, and he states that Mr. Roberts, the campground guy, was in a psych ward, because he had lost his short term memory due to repeated obliviation. Amelia is then surprised to find out that he'd been memory charmed, like, 30 times in an hour, and she realized they need to start getting wizards to take more care and have more caution.

**** I remember reading a good story called Memoriam (I think); it was about a muggle girl who witnessed a murder by wizards (and the subsequent cover-up by Aurors), is tracked down and obliviated, but later has to have her memory restored on account of being the only one who can identify the killers.

It focuses on how the rampart murders by the Death Eaters, and the cover ups by Aurors (they disguise them as drug overdoses) have a serious effect on relationships and muggle society as a whole; later on, it becomes about Jessica's (I think that's the main character's name?) allergy to magic (gained because she saw a murder, was obliviated then traumatizingly un-obliviated) and thus inability to be obliviated again, and Fudge's willingness to dispose of her.

Yes and no. It's important to remember that Kingsley, someone who comes from an old pureblood family, was able to comfortably navigate a Muggle job at the highest level (secretary to the Prime Minister) without anyone suspecting a thing.

I tend to think of the pronunciation issue as a matter of willful ignorance, a cultural norm that allows wizards to exhibit their complete disdain for all things Muggle. But if serious circumstances require that competent wizards blend in, they can with ease.

The Statute of Secrecy would surely have been broken years ago if they couldn't, after all.

*** I like that, it's great premise for stories and it makes sense when you consider the ones congrolling the wizarding world are pureblood who were homeschooled and probably did not step one toe in Muggle London. It also gives more sense to why Dark Lords such as Voldemort and grindelwald could father so many followers. Racism? Yes, absolutely. But it make sense and it gives great plot possibility for future stories.

***** Slightly off topic, but when I studied anthropology the class was full to the brim of white kids that had the best intentions but were so painfully clumsy when it came to dealing with other cultures, especially any words they found too difficult or awkward to say. You would think, given that I was in perhaps one of the most multicultural countries in the world, that there would be diversity in the subject and that people may use their own background and roots to work with different cultures. But nope, just a bunch of middle class white kids (of which I was one).

I definitely think you're right in wizarding culture being highly exaggerated in its isolation, but I've always felt that the Muggle Liason office being filled with clueless purebloods was actually fairly accurate.

****** I'm not even really talking about Arthur; his job was less liaising with Muggles and more preventing magic from falling into their hands. It's just that fans act like he's the extent of Wizarding knowledge of Muggles, and I'm like stop and think for a minute. Take Harry's dorm for instance - the boys that are at least passingly familiar with Muggle culture (Harry, Dean, Seamus) outnumber the boys who aren't (Ron and arguably Neville).

******* Yes, I completely agree with this. I find it odd that Ron is surprised that muggle pictures don't move - although the Weasleys live a fairly isolated existence he will have been to the village before and seen posters and leaflets and newspapers. I also don't think it's realistic that wizards get dressing like Muggles so ridiculously wrong - wearing out of date or unusually flamboyant clothes, yes. Dressing like you've fallen into the bargain bin at a charity shop, no. But I do find it quite charming so am willing to suspend my disbelief!

I'm not asking them to expound on the mysteries of the universe. What I'm saying is that they're going to be solidly aware of their culture. You don't need to be "knowledgeable in science" to know that it's electricity, not ekeltricity, or that phones exist/how to use them, or any number of little things. It makes for a funny (well, debatably) gag but it makes absolutely no sense that for instance Harry is the first person Arthur's met that can tell him what a rubber duck is for. Like, just ask your nearest Muggleborn.

Beyond that, there's bound to be a significant cultural crossover that's just not acknowledged.

That said, I always imagined that his job was dealing with obviously enchanted objects that could be found and/or used by muggles, which I guess you might have meant by “Misuse of Artifacts by Muggles” though I'm not sure about that. And yeah, he would not need to know what electricity or anything is to do it since it should be obvious when an item is /obviously/ enchanted; I mean, an electric shaver that never runs out of power probably would be a “meh, whatever” regardless of whose hands it was in, whereas a hair ribbon that ties itself when it touches someone's hair would obviously count as misuse if left for muggles to find it.
