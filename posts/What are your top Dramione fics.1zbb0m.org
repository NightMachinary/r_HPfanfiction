** I have been an avid Dramione shipper for many years and the three stories linked below are all very very good!

I've been reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8982722/1/Cruel-and-Beautiful-World][Cruel and Beautiful World]] for the last few days and it is a great story.

The world building is supurb and the characters are all very well written, easy to believe (no real out of character issues that often strips characters down) and the writer has an amazing flow to her writing.

I know it has been nearly a month since you asked, but I really think more people should look at this.

*** Haha, it's fine. This sub tends to be a bit slow, I'm used to it. After all, we only check reddit once we've run out of things to read.
