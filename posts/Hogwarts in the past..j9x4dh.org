Inspired by the recent toilet post, I was wondering if there's any good fics about Hogwarts in an earlier period. Where the character discovers how truly grim (compared to modern standards of living) the past was.

Bonus points, if the people in the past thing Harry/the character is off his rocker for wanting privacy/hygiene. The magic of the past could be different in priorities and spells, but overall less convenient as research has yet to take place.


** During the Middle Age, most European Muggles rarely bathed because it was considered a sin. Then when the Black Death struck, the Jews fared a lot better because of their better hygiene, and were thus [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Jews_during_the_Black_Death][blamed and hunted down in various pogroms]]:

  There are many possible reasons why Jews were accused to be the cause for the plague. One reason was because there was a general sense of anti-Semitism in the 14th century.[4] Jews were also isolated in the ghettos, which meant in some places that Jews were less affected.[14][15] Additionally, *there are many Jewish laws that promote cleanliness: a Jew must wash his or her hands before eating bread and after using the bathroom, it was customary for Jews to bathe once a week before the Sabbath, a corpse must be washed before burial*, and so on.[5]

They were literally the filthy Muggles back then. Wizards, even if that bullshit tweet by JKR held some truth, were magnitudes cleaner.

*** Thanks for that text.

I am indeed a European muggle (English, living in Scotland) so many of history lessons and school trips featured around our dirty ways. People were living in squalor and slums as recently as WW2. It wasn't until post-war that people started to question it.

Dumbledore, for example, was born only 6 years after London's sewers were completed.

I'm still trying to wrap my head around how and why this mindset even came into existence, considering that even in Christian Rome, bathing was a very regular activity.

*** Basically, /that/ is the original point of religion: giving the believers some sort of guideline on how to live safely. Circumcision of boys, not eating pork and being near dogs, not mixing cutlery for meat and milk... thousands of years ago nobody knew of bacteria, viruses, fungi and other pathogens but sure enough those who stuck to the religion managed to survive. Not to mention that the Old Testament and the Holy Quran carry a decent load of military/war stuff.

Wizards on the other hand? They need not obey any of that...

** I think it would be interesting if someone from modern times traveled back in time to when wizards and muggles were living in squalor and educated them on how to properly clean themselves and why it was important to do so

*** I think they'd be lynched, tbh. The victorians didn't take kindly to the people who told them their cesspits were close to their water sources.

**** Reminds me of something I read where medieval men were jealous of Vikings because they took baths and their wives found that appealing
