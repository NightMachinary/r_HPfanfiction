Setting the scene a bit, Harry,& fam, are back at Grimmauld place.Then this." “Are Harry and Hermione and Ron catching up?” Molly said.“Ron's unpacking. Hermione and Harry are snogging,” Ginny said.“What?!” Molly said.“Thank God! Subliminal messages do work!” Sirius said.“What?” Molly said.“Well, when Harry was a baby, I used to whisper pearls of wisdom in his ear, and hope they would stick. I alway hoped he'd find a girl like Lily: smart, down to earth, but with a sense of wonder, open-minded. I used to tell him, ‘Fall in love with a girl just like your mum,' and he has,” Sirius said. “I owe my life to Hermione Granger. She's a wonderful girl. I hope he doesn't let her go.”“Hear, hear. She was my brightest student, by far, during my brief time at Hogwarts,” Remus said.“A toast, to young love?” Sirius suggested, and poured some glasses of the brandy he had used in baking.Ginny burst into tears. Molly looked alarmed, but quickly pulled her only daughter into her ample bosom. Remus and Sirius exchanged worried glances.“I love him!!” Ginny hiccupped. “I always loved him! Before I even met him! And he's just like all the stories of him, so brave and kind and...and...he saved me, he saved Dad, he's a hero...Hermione didn't even grow up knowing anything about him!” "

I have to admit I lul'd very hard at Sirius. I think some crack on this vein needs to be tapped.
