I'm looking for a fic where Harry is very good at runes and is friends with Luna and Neville, also he starts to make essences from verious potion ingredients.


** Sounds like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5077573/1/RuneMaster][RuneMaster]]: In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.

*** Thank you I actually think I've got 2 stories mixed up rune aster is one of the ones I'm thinking of. The other is where Harry takes on the mantle of death and makes himself a scyth layered with silver essence that he made.

**** That is still [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5077573/1/RuneMaster][RuneMaster]] like [[/u/SymphonySamurai]] said. He begins creating the Scythe in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5077573/13/RuneMaster][Chapter 13.]]
