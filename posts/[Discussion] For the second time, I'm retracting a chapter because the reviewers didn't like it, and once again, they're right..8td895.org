Most recent chapter of Holly Polter went down like swallowing a piece of glass. The reviewers have shouted at me, and following the necessary 3-day reaction-dissipation period, I can see what they're saying is right.

Now I have to retract the chapter and work up a replacement one that makes more sense for the story's intended themes and style.

It's a good thing, and I value the fanfiction format for making it possible.

Anyone else pulled a chapter from justified criticism?


** I have never changed anything, but that's mainly because I have it all planned in advance. But I hsve been getting some really harsh reviews before. My story has been called propaganda. I've been called a fascist and a 'bleeding-heart libtard'. And no, I didn't change it, because my story was never meant for everyone. If you feel the critique was valid and you agreed something needed to be changed, good for you! That's what reviews are for! I applaud you for taking this in stride! But never, ever let somebody else write your story. Do you have a beta to bounce ideas off of?

** I removed a large chunk (~1000 words) of a chapter after it was pointed out to me that reading through that kind of recollective dialogue with pretty much nothing happening (the two people just sit there and talk, it was an empty room on purpose) was rather tedious and I replaced it with two lines of in-media-res.

However, I had a pretty criticized scene where a couple of Hit Wizards, one who is from a Death Eater family, overstepped their boundaries when it looked like Harry broke the law. I mentioned Sirius' arrest by hit wizards at least three times, that Harry had already encountered Ministry "Justice" at the hands of Fudge and Umbridge and yet everyone just kept telling me that Hit Wizards were in fact not supposed to be bad, that it would not be good to break the law and so on. I kept that scene since it was one of the crucial scenes to get the whole plot going after a lot of fluff.

I also had some rather deep reaching disagreements with the guy I used to bounce ideas around with. Following Harry's arrest, him getting kicked while on the ground and Tonks coming to the rescue, there was a scene where they, both shaken by the whole mess and about a week into a romantic relationship (with a platonic one existing for some time), chose to have sex at a secure location. Was it the right call to shag instead of immediately writing a letter to Dumbledore? Of course not. But I try to write characters who are humans and not members of the SPARTAN-II project and I stand by that. I won't write PTSD angst-orgies, but the protagonists are more than just killing machines.

** I rushed out the ending of one of my fics once-- I thought it was a reasonable ending at first, but it made for HORRIBLE storytelling, and was extremely boring.

I got a few disappointed reviews, so I went back and completely rewrote it-- because yeah, they were right in calling it a bad ending.

On the flip side, I've gotten a lot of complaints about details in my stories that were just the reader being dumb/wrong, and I've never felt the need to change anything in my story to accommodate that type of reviewer.

Most of my works, in fact.

This was a case where the material coming out was funny or meaningful or cool in and of itself but their place in the story was a serious navigational error and change in theme. It's like 'well, we're gearing up to build a student insurrection, but let's go off into a bizarro rumination on the sad life of clowns beneath the makeup'. Maybe not that bad, but you get the idea.

** I've never pulled an entire chapter before, but I have gone back and edited two of them IIRC in response to reader criticism. One case was when there was a fight between major characters, and the reviewers correctly pointed out that they were acting out of character. I didn't remove the entire fight, but I changed it significantly. The second time was a battle in which Hermione was holding back for narrative reasons, and my readers correctly pointed out that it didn't make sense for her to do that at that point. So I rewrote the battle to remove her choice to let the enemy off easy.

However, while I have changed a couple of chapters, there have easily been have a dozen where I wrote and Author's Note defending my position against quite harsh criticism--and in many cases told the readers to just /be patient/ because the thing there were complaining about would be resolved later.

Readers do often give valid criticism, but you have to take it with a grain of salt.

** No, I outline my fics before I even begin to write them, down to each chapter. So all the editing, formatting, story-plot-things that may be wrong, or not fit or anything get pulled and reworked before hand. If my reviewers don't like it that's their prerogative, they have a right to their opinion, however the chapter remains because it is my story, and it has a purpose and place in the story. I didn't enjoy Snape's death in Harry Potter, but I didn't write to JK to demand she re-write it either. There will always be parts people won't like. I don't like every single pairing JK did, but it is what it is. I refuse to change them based on people's dislike.

Now imagine a similar situation where you /realize/ (once someone has pointed it out) that you could have written something much better, better by your /own/ standards too.
