I'm looking for fics that are a bit longer (around 100k) that have Harry raised by a loving family, preferably his and with siblings. I DO NOT want any abuse or neglect from his parents. I also wouldn't mind reading about either one of this parents, Sirius, Remus, Molly etc I don't want any of the Lord Potter or overly powerful Harry

I'd prefer H/G but if it's well written I could do anything that's not H/H

Thank you in advance!


** Okay this may not be what you want there is mentions of abuse with the Dursleys but he is rescued and raised by Sirius, Remus, and their respective wives. He gets various siblings. It is AU and can be a bit tropey I suppose but it wasn't when it was written. The series covers all 7 years though it was started before HBP I think. linkffn(Living With Danger)

**** If you're looking for a "family" story, I really enjoyed this series, particularly the first fic. It does get...very AU later, but it's still good. I like the reread Living With Danger every once in a while.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11951854/1/The-Girl-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Boy-Who-Lived][The Girl in the Shadow of the Boy Who Lived]] by ContraryToEverything is really well written in my opinion. Basically, Harry has a younger sister in this fic and their parents are still alive. I read most of the author's works, and I'm happy to say that each story is original. They all have that HP world spark, but it's new and unexpected so it would keep you on the edge of your seat.

Well written, but when Ron Weasley suddenly broke out in /prayer/ my suspension of disbelief shrivelled up and died.

#+begin_quote
  "I think we should pray for Neville and Dean and Seamus," Ron blurted. He looked around earnestly... blah blah

  Ron bowed his head. "Dear God, or magic, or whoever is listening. Thanks that I'm OK, and that my family is here. Thanks that ... blah blah
#+end_quote

And then it went straight into Christianity.

#+begin_quote
  "For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, forever and ever, amen," Charlie said quietly. The rest of the family looked at him in shock. He shrugged. "Well, I guess I found more than dragons in Romania. They're a bit keener on church there than we are here. Not going to make a big deal about it, but I'll be praying for all of us a bit harder now."
#+end_quote

Oh /please/. The only reason I can find for Wizards and Witches being Christians is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome][Stockholm syndrome]]. Or perhaps an American author pushing a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract][personal agenda]].

That and the focus on muggle guns might put non-American readers off, like it did me.

**** *Stockholm syndrome*

Stockholm syndrome is a condition that causes hostages to develop a psychological alliance with their captors as a survival strategy during captivity. These feelings, resulting from a bond formed between captor and captives during intimate time spent together, are generally considered irrational in light of the danger or risk endured by the victims. Generally speaking, Stockholm syndrome consists of "strong emotional ties that develop between two persons where one person intermittently harasses, beats, threatens, abuses, or intimidates the other." The FBI's Hostage Barricade Database System shows that roughly eight percent of victims show evidence of Stockholm syndrome.

It was formally named in 1973 when four hostages were taken during a bank robbery in Stockholm, Sweden.

Yeah, that author is definitely religious, and while the mentions don't derail the story, they did take me out of it. He actually reuses a unique Christmas tradition from another one of his stories (or perhaps more, I haven't read any others) in /Iron Lady/, leading me to think that's something he does at home.

I like that aspect of reading in general, though it's much more pronounced in fanfic; you can often piece together bits of who an author is based on how they write.
