** I'm currently writing "The Dark Lord Never Died", where Malfoy took over Britain in 1981. In 1999, Hermione is a "Wand of Britain", raised as a loyal soldier for the new regime, while Ron is an agent for the exiled Dumbledore. Voldemort, who was betrayed by Malfoy, just returned, and started attacking Britain.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - and Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
