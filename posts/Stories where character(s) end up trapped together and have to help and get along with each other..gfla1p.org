Maybe something like 21 Days by evil minded, but it doesn't necessarily have to be exactly that. But kind of the spirit of what I'm searching for. For those who don't know: Characters end up trapped, have nervous break downs, people wonder if they're going to survive being trapped, et cetra.

Can be from any era, can have any warnings, anyone can be the main character, can be on any site.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual (Doesn't have to focus on a pairing).

No OP Harry, no Harem Harry, no Lord Potter. Harry slightly more powerful, or slightly smarter then in canon is fine, but I'd like for it to be believable. If Harry is a "Lord" I'd like for help to try and help others instead of using it for his personal gain, or his friends personal gain.

Would rather not have Weasley Bashing.

Would rather it was completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.


** Threesomes ok but no harem?

What's that ya smokin? Please share with the rest of the board.

*** Harems usually lead to the over powered Harry trope which I tend to hate.

Sounds like you need to read more Stronk! Harry fics. OP Harry is fun as shit when written right and sometimes when it isn't.

***** Unfortunately the over powered Harry is usually written badly, but maybe it's the fics that I'm just so happening to read?

I also don't like Weasley bashing, which over powered Harry tends to have.

Do you know of any good ones that don't bash the Weasley's by any chance?

** linkffn(A place for warriors by owlsaway)

HP and Snape stuck in a fucked up sort of sentient version of the room of requirement. Snape has no magic.

Totally het. They get to really understand each other more than anything else, sort of parental at the end once they are out. Snape is shown in a pretty objective light - somewhat pathetic. I really like the Harry in this.

  Dumbledore locks Harry and Snape in the Room of Requirement. Harry's magic works, and Snape's doesn't. Will they kill each other? No slash.
