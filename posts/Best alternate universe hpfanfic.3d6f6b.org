*** This story is practically the first thing that comes to mind when I think AU.

Others:

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Greater Good)\\
linkffn(Firebird's Son)\\
linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent by Sanction)\\
linkffn(On the Way to Greatness)\\
linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School)

To be fair, anything that isn't canon compliant is AU, but these are the ones with the best AU worldbuilding.
