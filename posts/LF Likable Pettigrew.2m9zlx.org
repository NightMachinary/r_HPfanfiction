Yep, another weird request. Fics where Pettigrew is likable or at least sympathetic. Has to remain at least sympathetic throughout. Something multi-chapter, AU is OK.


** Children of the shadows often writes sympathetic or even nice pettigrew stories. But her ship is SB/RL so not sure if that's your bag.

/Dating Remus Lupin/ has a very likeable, endearingly stupid, peter. It even foreshadows his betrayal, but shows how much the idea disturbs him.

That's the only author I think I've read that does that though. But I couldn't be certain, will mention more if I think of them.

PS. It's also one of the stories I've re read most. I love it.

** I knew I had read something like this recently but couldn't pin it until I remember it was at the very end of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][the Well Groomed Mind.]] (The very last chapter (27, Part 2: Chapter 9) has Peter in a good light.)

It is on hiatus and could be a long time until it is updated further but it might be good to keep it in mind as it seems like more Pettigrew is imminent (if/once it starts back up again). OR You could just read the very last chapter perhaps as it involves Peters memories in a pensieve so while it may be a little jarring, not having read the whole story, it probably stands alone enough to give you a little Pettigrew one-shot/glimpse sort of thing to get your fix.

** The Promises Trilogy, starting with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1248431/1/Promises-Unbroken][Promises Unbroken]], has a redeemed Pettigrew. As well as a living James & Lily. An amazing read!

  Sirius Black remained the Secret Keeper and everything he feared came to pass. Ten years later, James and Lily live, Harry attends Hogwarts, and Voldemort remains...yet the world is different and nothing is as it seems. AU, updated for HBP.

** Haven't got a fic for you, but I always wanted to write either a 1-7 year or 5-7 year story from Peter's POV. Showing him AS one of the gang, likeable and awkward with a little crush on Lily. Which of course would run into his betrayal and his conflict with himself and his self-preservation, his good and his evil. His Friends or is life.

** There's a peggy sue story where Peter is the one to jump back in time to before he was made secret keeper and solves the betrayal issue by fleeing to France until the war goes away. I think he sends Dumbledore letters about what he knows anonymously, but its been a while since I've read it so details (like the name of the fic) elude me.

Its short, but I found it amusing.

*** I've read this one too. Unfortunately, I dont know the name. I do think he fled to Amstersam, not France. I think he convinced the Potters, or at least Lily, to join him.

** The Sacrifices series by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Lightning on the Wave]] has this, but I can't recommend slogging through that monstrosity just for Pettigrew.
