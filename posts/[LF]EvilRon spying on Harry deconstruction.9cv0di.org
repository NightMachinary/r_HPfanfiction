I'm trying to find a short one-shot I read a few months back. It was sort of a parody of the "Dumbledore pays Ron to spy on Harry" cliche where Ron secretly decides to be an actual friend to Harry because if Dumbledore's that scared of him, he's clearly going to be really powerful when he grows up and Ron can ride his coattails to glory.

EDIT: Nvm, found it. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12279668/1/Greedy-Ron-And-The-Three-Seconds-Of-Thinking-Ahead][Greedy Ron And The Three Seconds Of Thinking Ahead]] by Right What Is Wrong.


** That sounds interesting. I've never really liked that trope.

I'm pretty sure RorschachsBlot has played with the "Oh they tried to buy me off. Here's your cut Harry. What should we tell them this time?" trope for Ron.

**** If it wasn't him, it was in one of DogbertCarroll's myriad of plot bunny files.

***** I like reading collections of plot bunnies but the problem with them is not being able to find a specific story when you have those "I know someone has written about this already" moments.
