** Hermione, well known for being submissive and meek, and attracted to neo-nazis.

Give me a fucking break.

***** She's not though. She stands up to Tom multiple times throughout the fic. She might be submissive in bed, but there's really no way to justify that as being out of character

******* Fair enough. You've got me there. But the fic is AU, so everyone would be out of character. I just don't think it's fair to say the entire fic is bad because of that. Is it a little cringe sometimes? Absolutely. Is it still a fun read? Also yes.

** I believe it's Pygmalion by Colubrina and after a quick google search it seems that the line is from chapter 12! linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11248015/1/]])

  When Tom Riddle walked through a doorway one fall afternoon everything changed and he found himself in a world wholly unprepared for him. "Something about you makes my brain itch," Hermione Granger said. "As if an earthquake had shifted everything sharply two feet to the left and then back again and it didn't all fit back quite right." Tomione. AU. COMPLETE.
