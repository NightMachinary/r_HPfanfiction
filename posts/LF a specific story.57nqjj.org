So, all I remember from this is the student's refusing to go to classes and stuff, and eventually Dumbles doesn't let them have food.

EDIT: There's also a refusal to attend Umbridge's classes, which starts this whole mess.


** Oh this is bugging me...I remember it too.

They basically board up in their dorms or something, right?

** I remember this too! I want to say it's just a small part of a much larger story, something like linkffn(Harry's Golden Nuggets), maybe? That might not be it, but it's some story that's really long and sort of funny but also stupid and takes itself way too seriously.

#+begin_quote
  Harry takes charge of his fate and the war. He manipulates the wizarding world with revolts, scams and his own vast wealth, but even the best laid plans go awry. His mistake costs him more than he bargains for. Regardless, he is committed to making his crazy plan work. Begins after GoF - Some Dumbledore bashing.
