I saw a post from someone that was looking for a fic where all three of them got turned into vampires. And now I'm starving for similar stories :D

Be it a curse from a fight, be it lycanthropy or vampirism or any other sort of creature, something happened to the trio that made them different from every other student. I'm looking for these types of stories, where all three of them experience something that forces them both away from other humans and closer to each other. Where they have to rely on each other and basically everyone else can be seen as an enemy.
