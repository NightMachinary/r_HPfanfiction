Hello everyone!

I'm very curious to see if there are any fics that explore the less savory aspects of the magical world, be it: crime, misuse of magic (things like love potions and compulsions), real corruption, or any number of other things.

Canon only really shows us a pretty good side of the wizarding world. For all the discrimination and racial intolerance, at least. It could be so much worse...and I'd like to read about it!


** One that comes a bit to mind is linkffn(Blood Crest) - it's an excellent fic that explores what might have happened if Harry had been found by - and essentially forced into - and apprenticed by a dark wizard.

It's a very interesting look at dark magic, and explores a bit more of Knockturn alley (with the vampires and hags and all that). The focus is more on the magical aspect of things than the crime ones, but it hits some of those notes and is definitely worth a read!

*** I love the worldbuilding and magical theory in Blood Crest. The OCs are so incredible too - I don't like Petri as a person but damn if I'm not there for Petri-grouchily-and-reluctantly-mentoring-Harry. Harry's such a ball of sunshine too

**** Yeah, the worldbuilding/theory aspects are incredibly strong. My favorite part of it is how cleanly it seems to fit into canon - it's exploring well beyond that, but everything /feels/ like it's just a natural extension. Even little details like making Snape more reasonable by having the questions he asked Harry be from the very start of the book make things come alive differently.

And yes, grouchy Petri is definitely a great part of it!
