Been playing a lot of monster hunter and that's led to me trying to find fics where Harry has a big interest in magical creatures, be it for the purpose of hunting them, taming them, or even just having a Hagrid level obsession with them.


** Weird as in ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) or not that kind of weird?

***** Well, I don't know how it will turn out on the MLP side, but the author really pastiches the writing style of HPMOR quite well, and considering they're also responsible for a very clever, very well-received "serious" HPMOR fanfanfic, I have high hopes.
