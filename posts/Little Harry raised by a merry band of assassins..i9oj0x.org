See title. That's it. That's all I'm asking for. Fun hijinxs and murder for hire.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

This Is a universe where a race of cat-people managed to visit their world's moon by drinking a highly addictive drug made from supposedly crystalized light, and then climbing on top of each other until they reached the moon.
