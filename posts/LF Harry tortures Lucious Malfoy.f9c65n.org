Hey everyone

As the title says I'm looking for fics detailing the torture of Lucius Malfoy by Harry, Ramsay Bolton style. I'm not into torture fics but like Rorschach describes in watchmen: when it's being done to the bad guys "it feels like justice".

Why Lucius? In my opinion he's the most despicable character in Harry Potter. From dodging prison by bribing the shit out of everyone, being a blood purist bigot, nearly killing a while generation of kids in Hogwarts in cos and getting away with it. Dumping a cursed item onto n eleven year old girl that nearly killed her by leeching off her life energy. And a legion of other crimes that fanfic authors made up.

And then at the end of the book series and movies he get's away with it all.

Bonus points: - no focus on a slash pairing - no Wasley bashing or Harry killing innocents.


** It's not exactly what you're looking for but in The Sum of Their Parts, Harry interrogates/tortures death eaters for information.

*** Yup read that one. I remember a fic whete Harry forms a group of vigilantes (most of which muggleborn) and hunts down death eate5s before Voldemort' return. I remember how they tortured Macnair for two weeks before killing him because that's how long he kept the veela girl alive that he kidnapled at the world cup.

So looking more for these 'justified' torture fics.

  When Zelretch conducts an experiment and the being known to all as Fate intervenes Harry Potter's life is changed irrevocably. Now being raised by those who don't fit the definition of 'Normal' it is a very different Harry that is unleashed on the world. Or is it worlds? Disclaimer: This is fan fiction, I only own the plot.
