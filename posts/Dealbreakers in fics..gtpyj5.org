What's your biggest dealbreaker? The absolute ‚ÄúNope, I'm out!‚Äù

I absolutely loose interest in stories where muggle movie and tv are shoehorned in.

I enjoy a well written fic where technology is a storyline or relevant. Warding fics that allow a ‚Äòmuggle room' fine, sneaking off to a cinema in summer fine, But ‚Äòand the they watched Star Wars (thanks Kretcher/Dobby)' is just annoying and feels uninspired to me. Like we know the magical world has gobstones, wizard chess, plants that scream when potted, magical art etc. Let hear about a night of that!


** Any bashing whatsoever.

Characters acting like assholes/being straight up evil while everyone including the author acts like they're good, and those actions are good

Muggle Wank. Wizarding wank too, but not nearly to the same extent. Canon sure makes a strong case for arguing that wizards are just straight up better off in every way to muggles.

Real world politics.

Characters spilling their guts out as just exposition, instead of the author figuring out a way to show/ incorporate it naturally into the story.

This really is only true if you take as factual the contemptuous statements made about them by the characters, things like muggles ignoring magic even if it's staring them in the face, and the descriptions of the muggles of Privet Drive as the backdrop of Harry's miserable childhood. I don't imagine the muggles of Harry Potter as a dull, witless, and magicless variant of wizards. I imagine them as normal people, like we have in the real world. We can't teleport, or create or destroy things with a thought and a wave of a stick, and we have diseases that wizards can cure that we cannot, but we have art, and science, and music, and philosophy isn't mentioned at all in the books, but we have that. Wizards certainly aren't incapable of pursuing any of these things, but magical culture also doesn't encourage a study of science, or of philosophy.

** Bashing. Magic nerf. Dumbledore nerf. Harry or Ron nerf. Eyes conveying everything a character thinks without the use of legilimency. Muggle wank. Weak main character.

** I never really had a problem with that, myself. It made me feel a little closer to the characters, to have them do things I'm familiar with, and react with a different perspective.

** Contrived plot points or conspiracies that solely exist to prolong a conflict because the original bad guy wasn't enough or new abilities that do the same, at least when done poorly. I just can't stand it when an author has to make the MC have a much more horrible time than the original. This especially applies to time travel fics. A group in the shadows that is manipulating the wizarding world to purposely keep people as dumb as possible or Voldemort's faction pulling some new ability out of their ass when they should be defeated just rub me the wrong way.

IIRC linkffn(Passageways by jerrway69) is an example of this done right, however.
