I read the amazing linkao3(Let Perpetual Light by tehtarik) a while ago, and I've been looking for Ariana-centric fics ever since. Does anyone have any recs? Or even some Aberforth-centric fics set in that era would be great.

If not, I'll accept /any/ fics set anytime between Dumbledore's first meeting with Grindelwald and Grindelwald's eventual downfall. I'll even accept just plain slash with no plot if there's interesting characterizations involved.

Oh, but I haven't watched Fantastic Beasts, so I would prefer not to be rec'd any fics with that setting/the film's characters.

Thanks!

Edit: Just realized I spelled Grindelwald wrong. Oops.

  In the village of Godric's Hollow, the Dumbledore family is falling apart. Kendra Dumbledore is dead under mysterious circumstances, and Albus is the unwilling guardian to his wayward brother Aberforth, and Ariana, their mad sister in the attic. But everything changes with the arrival of Gellert Grindelwald, violently charming juvenile delinquent with an obsession for the fabled Deathly Hallows.

** Did you look through the [[http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Community:%20grindeldore/works][grindledore]] community on ao3? linkao3(2428940) is pretty good.

linkao3(76683; 6452494) are two fics in the same time period.

If you're okay with crack, then linkffn(3894917) is hilarious.

I'll second the rec for /Let Perpetual Light/. One of my favorite fics.

  “Here is history: ... History is Albus lying through his teeth about how he felt that morning -- was he afraid, was he angry, was he righteous?  History is not heartbroken.”When Albus is nine, not a day goes by in which newspaper headlines don't proclaim his father's wickedness to the world.  For the rest of his life, the lesson that some stories were never meant to make their way into the public record remains with him.  A character piece about truth, love, history, family, and the life and lies of Albus Dumbledore.
