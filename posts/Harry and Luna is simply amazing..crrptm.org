Just got done reading Easier than Falling Asleep by Jacob Apples and absolutely enjoyed it. It was smaller than most of my reads so it surprised me just how good was. So then I'm asking, as my desire is reawakened, for some Huna stories.

Requirements -80k words at least -Somewhat well written -Not Post-war

  The sequel to Bungle in the Jungle. Told in 2nd person. Harry Potter has returned to England. In the jungles of South America, he became his own man, a hero of his own choice and not unfortunate circumstance. Is it enough to save him?

  Some days I'm just so happy to be alive. Then again some days I'm lying on my back, bleeding from my forehead wondering weather I screwed over the pope in a past life. Today is not a happy day. HarryLuna, Hermione Bashing, Powerful Harry...

** I've just finished the last part of the Firebird trilogy by Darth Mars. Now the author is not everyone's cup of tea since scenes can be brutal. Expect violence, gore, death, torture and rape, although never in explicit detail, nothing that I would call graphic except for the violence. It's a very captivating world he creates though and I tore through the 3 parts very quickly. It's Harry/Multi but not in a standard fanfiction way if that makes sense, main pairing is Harry/Luna.

*** Might also mention that the Firebird trilogy, different from most of his other works, is absolutely depressing (don't know if that is 100% the correct word to describe it). If anyone is expecting a happy or even normal feeling fic, this is not even remotely for you.
