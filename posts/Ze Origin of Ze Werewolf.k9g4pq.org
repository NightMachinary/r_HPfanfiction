Ok so what if lycanthropy isn't as evil as we think.

Think back to the times without modern medicine. Imagine all the babies that die cause they aren't healthy enough to survive their first winter.

Now Imagine a werewolf. Heals from anything, can turn into a wolf (a very good pack hunter) and is only injured by silver (the holy metal)

These creatures are blessings from a higher power. What if, back when say Fenrir [the wolf god] wasn't chained up, he blessed the weak and helpless of the children of his followers with this.

Now normally werewolves change at will and aren't savage killers but when the wolf god was chained he couldn't howl with the werewolves to keep them docile so now the transformation hurts them instead of helping.

Edit: that could also be why he wants to eat the moon! To stop the werewolves pain.


** We feel sorry for Remus but really Greyback was doing him a solid. Now Remus has turned his back on his savors that are trying to recruit him to 'The only path worth treading'. Greyback, a zealot, lighting the path for children to come. I could read something along those lines with a narrative bouncing back and forth between Greyback and Remus so you don't know which narrative is reliable.

** Unpopular opinion: Compared to many real life diseases and syndromes, Lycanthropy is really just a walk in the park and shows just how sheltered and cut off from the wider reality Wizards are if this is the top of the line plague everyone fears.

*** That is a complete dog yet also true I don't know how you can say Llycanthropy is a walk in the park having your bones cracked and forming into a new bone structure growing lots of hair at one teeth elongation losing your mental cabalities being insanely angry and having an urge for human flesh is not a walk in the park its a torturous disease and the only thing we don't know is if its fatal and considering remus had grey hair can barely get a job I don't know about this whole walk in the park thing the onky thing worse is maybe cancer and even that doesn't come close to the sheer pain werewolves go through every month physically and mentally

** You should read Harry Potter and the bucket list by Darkpetal16. It is a SI/OC with an understandable Fenrir who did what he did to protect other werewolves.

Edit: The SI also finds a plausible explanation on the origin of werewolves and lycanthropy.
