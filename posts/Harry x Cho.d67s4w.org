Never really read this pairing oddly enough so I am looking for some well written Harry x Cho.


** I've never really read any HxC fics where the couple was endgame either, but only because I wasn't really looking for them. I just always found the couple weird since Harry was dating a girl whose boyfriend just died and how he was even friends with the guy to some extent. Though movie Cho was very pretty. I tend to like pairings with Harry and Luna or Hermione.

*** Book Cho was also pretty, which was half the reason why Harry was crushing on her.

  In the trio's fifth year nothing seems the same. There's more work, a new High Inquisitor and new relationships beginning. If only the world wasn't sick and actually lived up to people's expectations.

** I also love this ship and have seen hardly any good fic on them. I'll make sure I check these out, but my favourite was Or Die Trying: The Story of Cho Chang. Linkffn(929578)

**** It's a rewrite. Since it was started before the books finished, some of it is not consistent with canon, but I just really liked how the author did actually incorporate Cho's culture and the struggles she faces at Hogwarts between pleading her peers and pleasing her family.

** Linkffn(4259161)

The only good H/C fic IMO because it does not include biblical amounts of teenage angst.

  What if Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts had begun not with a dementor attack and a trumped-up charge but with a birthday party and a ransom note? In this AU, the Order's decision to pull Harry out of Privet Drive on July 31 has far-reaching consequences.
