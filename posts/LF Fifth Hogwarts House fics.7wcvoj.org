  Young Harry liked numbers, he liked using numbers and working out the value of things. When he found out that he was a wizard and had a big pile of gold... well, he had something new to calculate. oneshot, complete, don't own.

#+begin_quote
  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

** Well, there's SIYE only [[http://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=129801][The Prevailing Counterpoint]], but there's a couple catches: it's starts where [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2954601/1/Taking-Control][Taking Control]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4924075/1/Free-Life][the abandoned sequal to that]] left off, for one. But those two stories are nothing short of excellent reads, and I highly recommend them. The other catch is that the prose is sickeningly pretentious and the plot is drawn out like a far too long soggy noodle. Just to give you a taste of what you're getting into, here's one kiss:

"He swept her into a kiss, as passionate as he dared without upsetting the cat. The touch of their lips was an enlivening spark to compensate for a late night and early morning. The soft pressure of their mouths was a tonic of joy to dispell worries and pain. A gentle tickle, from whiskers of a curious cat, was a reminder that for all their responsibilities and dedication ... there was still time for the occasional giggle

They didn't always remember it, but that Harry and Ginny were still young; they had every right to play, be carefree, and laugh. And right now they were in just the right mood for it. But somewhere in the giocoso melody of their tender exchange was a droning tanpura, rising up to remind them that they had a schedule to keep.

They pulled back an inch --- just enough distance to permit their shining eyes to beam into each other's souls for one more long moment. The fingers of Harry's free hand traced a crescent along Ginny's cheek then drifted off. Harry's smile kissed Ginny's nose and they reluctantly separated and resumed the last hundred yards of the path, giving the birds one final opportunity to serenade them as the grand old castle filled their sight."

*** I think it must be just me, but I never understood the love for Taking Control. It just seemed to be Harry all of a sudden becoming amazing without flaws and making everything easy for him. I read it and wondered where the conflict was, and found Harry way too perfect.

** Linkffn(11637611)

Definitely crack with an OP fem!Harry but there's a fifth house, first born out of convenience and then officially accepted by Hogwarts magic (they get their own table and get students via Sorting Hat. The first few chapters are a little tedious because there is little dialogue and some light Hermione bashing (she gets a full redemption later). There's a half sibling, but the Potter sisters get along after an initial clash of personality.

It's not a literary masterpiece, but definitely a story which I enjoyed rereading and still find it hilarious.

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.
