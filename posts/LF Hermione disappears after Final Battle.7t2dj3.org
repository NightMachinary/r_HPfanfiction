So lately I've been wanting to reread some of the older fanfics that I've enjoyed but I can not for the life of me remember the name of this one fanfic. After the Final Battle, Hermoine travels to Aussie Land to restore her parents but never returns. Later, Harry (and maybe Ron, don't remember) arrive searching for her. Harry locates her parents (again sorry don't exactly remember if Hermoine is there or not) and he discovers a little girl that looks just like him. It was an older piece, I remember liking it, but I don't remember if it was completed or not. Any help is appreciated.

*** Thanks for the reply, but no that wasn't it. I will read though. Two points I remember very well about the story I'm looking for is it takes place in Australia. And there was a very touching scene where he was pushing her (the daughter) on a tire swing telling her about his Hermione while the grandma looked on.

edit. Read up to chapter 10, definitely not it.

**** Just curious... Was the girl Hermione or her daughter? Both curious to help find plus I'm intrigued. :D

***** Pretty sure she was Harry and Hermione's daughter. It was an H/Hr story but I don't remember Hermione ever showing up in the story, so either incomplete or Hermione died and I don't remember the scene. I think either or both are very likely, because the tire swing scene was the last scene I remember.

*** I posted it there already as well. At this point, I suspect it's simply lost. I have however started planning out how I would write this story. I don't know if I'll post it or not, but I plan on at least writing it.
