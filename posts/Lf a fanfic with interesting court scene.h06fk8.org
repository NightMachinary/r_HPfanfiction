:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read a fanfic sometime ago, where during the hearing (I think before his 5th year), Dumbledore acts as his defender, but provides arguments for his punishment, and his prosecutor (who's secretly in his side) provides arguments for his innocence. Amelia Bones quickly puts a stop to it. I think it was because of a favour she owed Harry, who asks that she conduct a fair trial. But I can't find that fix. Please, help me.


** It's a WBWL fic if that helps, I cant remember the actual name though
