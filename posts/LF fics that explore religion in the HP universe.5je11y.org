** Fics where there are wizarding religion(s) that I have read/remember:linkffn(Patron by Starfox; Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome;Wit of a Raven; Prince of the Dark Kingdom). My favorite of these would be Untitled Tome. Wit of the Raven is good but abandoned. Patron is well-liked here but just not my thing. Prince of the Dark Kingdom is widely loved but I think it's overrated.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** linkffn(8769990) This series has a heavy dose of religion although not specific to wizards. If you search some of the more Slytherin Harry, pureblood culture fics you'll often find references to paganism and their own holidays but I can't think of any off the top of my head that explore it properly.
