Weird request and oddly specific.. but a fic with a relatively gory take on wizarding world adventures BUT I want the overall tone of the story to be upbeat. Not necessarily happy, although non-evil protagonists are preferred, but just like upbeat-horror if that makes sense? Only examples I can think of would horror-comedies like Scary movie, scream, etc.


** Not sure it fits entirely but you could try [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19328290/chapters/45976822][The Archeologist]]. The cursebreaking somewhat fits although they also spend a decent amount of time at Hogwarts. It's not explicitly gory, and the adorableness to me more came from Harry being wildly unaware of his own power. It's complete though and very enjoyable.

If you haven't read it you could also try Make a Wish. It's very humorous, but death eaters routinely die in unpredictable and gruesome ways.

** I gotchu fren though this is a crossover of hp and the Addams family. Personally, I love this. The tone isn't angsty nor serious it's more like what you've asked for, or rather, it feels like the Addams.

In other words, Harry is adopted by the Addams family and fits right in.

There are 7 separate stories. The first one is pre-hogwarts (the link below) and it ends with the half-blood prince story (go check the author for this). It doesn't seem to have the deathly hallows though.

  He's done it. He's just five years old, but he's finally done it. The Dursleys are gone. And now he's with a new family who seems just as twisted as he is. How strange.

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.

  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** I've thought about writing a story like this for a while.

A Daphne SI that goes full on about learning Dark magic and gets fuck up in the head because of it. Then proceeds to become an orochimaru expy(magical mad scientist searching for immortality)

But all of that with the typical irreverence and lack of concern that a lot of SI show and with a really bubbly personality.

Edit: The story I am referring to is Blood and Chaos by Aetheron, highly recommend it for a good fun read.

  Sometimes, an average family has secrets. The residents of 1313 Mockingbird Lane have more secrets than most. Perhaps their biggest secret is how family comes first and foremost. Once he turns 11, young Harry Munster is offered a place at the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry, but he isn't interested, for four reasons. Dodgers, Dresses, Teddy bears, and Spot.

  Fifteen months in Azkaban Prison following the Chamber of Secrets fiasco leaves Harry Potter less than interested in being anybody's hero, and thanks to his psychotic friends, unreliable allies, persistent enemies, prophecies, tournaments, war, politics, magic insanity, and the perils of true love, it'd be a wonder if any of us remained sane.
