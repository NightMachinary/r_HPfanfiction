Something about the Deathly Hallows and the whole 'Master of Death' thing (especially as represented in fanfiction) always bothered me, and it wasn't until recently that I figured it out. The idea that three guys in 13th century Europe were the /only/ ones to come up with such powerful objects as to 'grant mastery over death'. It's so limiting.

There's other nations and cultures out there, and while, yes, canon was fairly sparse, this is /fanfiction/! We're more creative than that! Why don't the Chinese have a massive jade cage capable of capturing spirits for interrogation? Or an Aztec dagger capable of killing /anything/, including things like Dementors or dragons, in one blow? Or Orpheus's actual lyre? Something from Ancient Egypt, one of the most famous death-revering cultures out there.

Just...something other than the standard 'it's a symbolic representation of mastering death', or 'LOLZ Harry's the Grim Reaper's boss and gets all the babes'.


** It's why I tend towards the hallows simply being powerful items made by the Peverell brothers rather than being made by Death.

I'd love a fic where there are other artefacts of similar power.

** I like the idea of this: each major civilization or culture in history had its own attempt at things, the driving forces behind the Peverells' Death Hallow creation, and it resulted in unique artifacts/"Masters".

Like, a sacrificial dagger from MesoAmerica that, once spattered in human blood from its owner, allows voices from the Other Side to be heard; another, from Ancient Egypt in the form of an Ankh, allows the dead to briefly possess an inanimate doll version of themselves, or something.

On becoming a "Master", Harry is invited into an exclusive, international club where they chill out, drink booze, and talk shop (about magic, life, death, et cetera).

*** Yeah, and the members run the gamut from potential revolutionaries ala Grindelwald to unintentional owners like Harry.

** Totally support this, the Egyptians had so much lore on Soul Magic and Death-speaking items, Aztecs as well but more on Blood Magic per se. Mictlantecuhtli's Jade Skull acts as a way to communicate with the dead but requires a blood sacrifice, Izanami no mikoto's mask allows you to transite the world of the dead, becoming one with them.

*** Exactly! There's a treasure trove of potential artifacts out there just ripe for the taking.

** This is a really cool idea! Can someone try making at least a oneshot on this concept?
