Wizarding Britain is doomed to create Dark Lords (or other moniker) that will utilise the flaws of Wizarding Britain Society. The Families of Wizarding Britain have been divided into Factions that don't mingle and are kept separate.

The House System of The Founders has been perverted to divide the Wizarding Society. Three Factors have played to pervert the system :

1. Despite the Founders choice of a system of House based on personality traits, the House System has become a political Factions Divide : Light Families - Sorted exclusively in Hufflepuff and Gryffindor, often Half-Bloods and Muggleborn, often at the bottom of the social hierarchy. Often Aurors of the DMLE. Neutral Families - Sorted exclusively in Ravenclaw or Slytherin, apolitical Ministry employees, sometimes Hit-Wizards and often Unspeakables of the Department of Mysteries. They can be rich sometimes. Half-Bloods and Purebloods. Dark Families - Sorted exclusively in Ravenclaw and Slytherin, often Rich and Noble, they often Seat on the Wizengamot and becomes Department Heads or Ministers of Magic. They are always influent in the Ministry.

2. Despite being a personality Traits System, the House System has acknowledged family expectations in the public eyes : Despite being a Personality Trait, the Families have expectation of it being passed by blood

- Some Families my disown if their child isn't sorted in the same Hogwarts House. Like Sirius case.

- It is logical that Personality Traits may be influenced by how one is being raised and it is logical for the families to raise their children to have the same Personality Traits are they parents.

- So Sirius Case may be a case of failed familial education

- It it also not logical to expect children not raised by their parents to not display their Parents Personality Traits and so be sorted elsewhere.

- Harry Potter hasn't been raised by his Parents but despite that it is expected for him to be sorted in his parents House : Gryffindor like Personality Traits were a product of nature (blood) not of nurture (familial education).

3.And the Sorting Hat itself has acknowledged those expectations in its sorting :

- Gregory Goyle and Vincent Crabbe have been sorted in Slytherin despite not having an ounce of Cunning, Intelligence and Ambition because they parents were Sorted in Slytherin.

- Hermione Granger been sorted in Gryffindor despite showing both a love of Knowledge for Knowledge itself and dismissing social niceties for the sake of Knowledge. And displaying each of others Ravenclaw's personality traits.

- Harry Potter being Sorted in Gryffindor despite showing both cunning, ambition and a love for Knowledge for utility sake. While Harry show Gryffindor Studborness and lack of preservation the Hat should not take false misconceptions as a factor in its Sorting.

4.Finally as a consequence of everything else, the Hogwarts House Divise is being continued in real life in the Wizarding Britain Society in its unions and Politics.
