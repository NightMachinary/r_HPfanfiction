** Occlumency is described as being a sort of mental judo. A soft martial art. You don't stop people from reading your mind. Instead, you keep the information you're trying to protect away from them, pushing what you want to be seen up to the forefront while disassociating from the dangerous and important information and burying it deep in the back, behind years of useless memories and trivia. You're redirecting the force of their probes and inquiries to what you want them to see, and keeping the knowledge you want hidden away from them.

Fanon says it's about building shields and walls, but that's nonsense. Snape used Occlumency to lie to Voldemort. If Voldemort literally could not read Snape's mind, he never would have trusted him. He would have likely simply killed him. Snape could only spy because he could keep the dangerous information away while letting Voldemort look through his memories.

In other words, there is no visible difference to the Legilimens between reading the mind of someone with no defenses or their defenses lowered, and reading a master who is actively deceiving them. It looks the same. The difference is that the master is deceiving you, they're successfully keeping something away from you. And that's all that Occlumency really is: a game of psychic keep-away.

I know it's not /funny/, there's no joke here. But if you wanted to assume that Harry has some natural mastery over Occlumency, then I think having to live with the Dursleys would be the best excuse. Harry had to learn how to hide his real emotions and feelings while he was growing up in the Dursley house. He had to hide the memories of the things he didn't want to be punished for. Compartmentalize, adapt, suppress, disassociate. And that could directly translate to having some Occlumency of his own, if you wanted it to.

Granted, I'm sure Rowling would disagree. Then again, Rowling also waited until after the books were over and done with before saying that magical children who get neglected and abused by their caretakers for expressing accidental magic turn into monsters that can level a large city or a small country, but this somehow didn't happen to Harry because hocus pocus whargarble stop asking questions.

*** Strongly agree with this interpretation of Occlumency- in fanon it is just so overpowered.

People use it for all sorts of stuff, and this whole "shields up" trope just makes for incredibly lazy writing.

Harry's one successful use of mind arts against Voldemort was when he focused on his love for his family, and his acceptance of death. Voldemort noped right out of Harry's mind as a result.

Clearly, the best strategy for Harry to adopt for keeping Voldy out of his mind was to focus on ideas that were so repulsive that Voldemort couldn't stand to look any deeper. Snape's approach was necessarily far more subtle, because he wasn't using it to reject an intruder, but to show an intruder only what he wanted them to see. This difference in approach, because of different desired outcomes, is partly what made Snape such a useless Occlumency teacher for Harry.

**** There is absolutely zero evidence that "different types" of Occlumency exist.

Basic Occlumency is clearing your mind of thoughts so the Legilimens has nothing to see or find. The next, and final, step after accomplishing this is being able to selectively clear your mind of the thoughts you don't want known, while leaving the rest alone and accessible. The first level makes it obvious what you're doing. The Legilimens knows they're being deceived. The second level hides the deception.

There is no "different type." There's not a shred of evidence for that. The only reason for you to insist to the contrary would be if you have some attachment to the utterly ridiculous fanon of building obsidian domes and armies of dragons in your mind, and you want to somehow make room for that in canon. I can't possibly imagine why, because the obsidian domes and mind dragons are one of the worst vices of Indy!Harry.

*** Excellent writeup!

One proviso is that it doesn't look like basic Occlumency really tries to deceive the Legilimens but rather tries to keep the Legilimens from eliciting any reaction at all (i.e., "close your mind"). That would work well enough for Harry against Voldemort or for Draco against Snape but not for Snape against Voldemort, for obvious reasons.

However, this entails the Occlumens experiencing whatever painful, disturbing, or otherwise traumatic stimuli the Legilimens throws at them and dissociating from them---shrugging them off. In this way, Snape calling up Harry's most painful memories as a part of the training makes perfect sense: when you consider that any stimulus from which the Occlumens cannot dissociate can be exploited by a hostile Legilimens, it makes a lot of sense.

In fact, the best possible Occlumency instructor may not be a mater Occlumens at all, but rather a sadist or a psychopath who is on your side who knows Legilimency: Bellatrix, for example. (Speaking of that, if you wanted to assume that Hermione had picked up Occlumency off-screen by DH, a good excuse might be that the probable Legilimens Bellatrix tortured her for information, rather than just read it from her mind.)

Also,

This is a very good point---but it would also require rewriting the whole history of Harry's interactions with the Dursleys. Harry doesn't hide anything from them to avoid punishment. Rather, he says and does what he wants and then bears the punishment. (The most extreme example of this is with Umbridge, of course.)

It's the same attitude that makes him pathologically incapable of following rules even when they are a good idea---such as "Don't wander around an unfamiliar magical castle at night over a matter of preadolescent honour, because you might run into a hungry Cerebrus" and makes him easily manipulated by the likes of Snape, Voldemort, and Umbridge, but also allows him to resist the Imperius and gives him a powerful Patronus.

I think that was because of Bellatrix taught him. Snape immediatly knew that Bella taught him - even when Narcissa has to be an accomblished occlumens too, seeing that she was lying into Voldemorts face and got away with it.

We also know that occlumency is about controlling your emotions. Bellatrix is not exactly a prime example for controlling her emotions. I think when she used occlumeny she used a very peculiar form and given her character I don't expect it to be subtle.

And, for Bellatrix to teach Occlumency, she doesn't need to be an Occlumens. She needs to be a Legilimens.

Which, by the way, gives one grounds to argue /Hermione/ had picked up Occlumency off-screen: if Bellatrix is a Legilimens, why did she need to torture Hermione for information? (Of course, a much simpler answer is that her sadism and magical racism had led her to make a suboptimal decision.)

**** Yes, and that's why it's fucking absurd. Harry was treated exactly like every other Obscurial, and even knew he was being punished for the freakishness. But because it was called freakishness and not magic, because the m-word was never used, he never turned into one. That's Rowling's official, canon explanation for why Harry did not become one, and it is laughably weak and pathetic. Harry didn't know it was */m a g i c/*, so that absence of knowledge was enough to stop him from becoming one. Harry was terrified of freakish things happening, he knew it would result in neglect and beatings, he knew good and well that the Dursleys hated the strange things that were happening around him, that he was the cause of the strange things, and that it was the strange things he was being punished for. He feared the strange things happening, he dreaded them. But the m-word was never used. So it doesn't count.

Obscurials were allegedly created by communities persecuting magical children that displayed accidental magic. Not all communities would know to even call it what it is. And yet we're lead to believe that's the deciding factor.

Harry Potter and Credence Barebone had nearly identical lives: their parents died, they were adopted by relatives, those relatives hated and feared magic, and those relatives abused them mentally and physically in an effort to beat it out of them. But Credence was told it was magic, while Harry was told it was freakishness. And that supposedly, allegedly, makes all the difference.

Rowling's excuses ring hollow. Privet Drive should have been a crater. Or, more realistically, Rowling should have never permitted the creation of Obscurials in the first place. It's a rather important thing, and the fact that she has to disassemble and rules lawyer about the inclusion or rejection of a certain word in a child's vocabulary as being the deciding factor shows that it was clearly a bad idea.

It's just as bullshit as Rowling's claims that James dying to protect Harry gave him no protection because /men don't love their children as much as women do/. Which was the official answer she gave during a Q&A that happened after GoF was published.

Rowling has shitty opinions and doesn't think her plotlines through. This is common knowledge and easily proven. She doesn't think love potions are or should be a big deal. She thinks men can't love their own children as much as women can. She's completely against the death penalty under any and all circumstances, to the point that she claims to have modeled Umbridge after her impressions of some woman in UK politics who supports it, but then had the audacity to create a story where 99% of the problems could have been solved with a death penalty for all marked Death Eaters after the first war. Hell, the fact that marked Death Eaters weren't killed after the /second/ war is the reason Delphini Riddle was never discovered by the system, and it's how Nott was able to make the Super Time Turner. So Cursed Child just highlights the problem /even more./ If you wanted to have a story where forgiveness and anti-death penalty are valid aesops, Harry Potter is not the story to write.

Rowling tries to use a soapbox to push certain ideas and notions of morality, but she's completely pants at it and inevitably either creates or signs off on the creation of plotlines that completely debunk what she was trying to say. Nobody I know of really agrees with her take on love potions. Every person I know who saw her post-GoF interview about James and Lily was scornful of her attitude towards men and children.

Obscurials are just another thing she fucked up to be thrown on top of the pile. Harry Potter should be one, and only the fact that Petunia Dursley said "we are beating the freakishness out of you" and not "we are beating the MAGIC out of you" stopped it from happening. Which is an utter joke. Some days I'm certain she doesn't even remember her own stories or what she's written.

Rowling is allowed to make up whatever rules she wants for how her world works. Which is why it's all the more absurd and unforgivable when the rules she makes up have massive contradictions in them. They're her rules, she's not being railroaded by anybody. She chooses to say the things that she says. There's only one rule for writing, which is remain internally consistent. Rowling can't be internally consistent to save her soul.

****** Yes, you can tell when someone is "beyond redemption." We have moral laws for that. It's bold to claim that it's a topic entirely reliant upon dentology, when the entire argument against it is an appeal to Christian morality, and yet Christian morals and laws clearly spell out exactly when someone is beyond redemption and precisely what the crimes punishable by death are.

You don't see objections to capital punishment outside of the Christian West. And those who object to it are almost entirely those who vocally reject or hold Christianity in contempt while simultaneously trying to make appeals using distortions of Christian law and morality. Without Christianity, you have no framework with which to appeal to "redemption" for murderers and rapists. Within Christianity, you have clear and irrefutable lines drawn for the employment of capital punishment. Thus, your 'dissidents' can only exist as auxiliary critics of Christian morality in a decaying orbit around societies their dissidence would have rendered them incapable of building. Such dissidence does not exist in Africa, Arabia, China, South-East Asia, South America, or anywhere else where Christianity is not the tradition.

Furthermore, such 'dissidence' is transient anyway. Objection to capital punishment does not exist in democratic or populist cultures and societies. It also does not exist in autocratic or authoritarian societies. Populism gives the people what they want, and both men and women have reason to support it. Rapists, murderers, and pedophiles directly threaten spouses, children, and families. By the same token, autocracies, monarchies, and other forms of authoritarian rule found their legitimacy upon a bedrock of law and order: a just and peaceful society. They cannot afford to permit rapists and murderers to get away with raping and murdering.

Thus, we can see that historically, the dissidence you speak of only really exists during oligarchies, decaying monarchies, subverted republics and democracies, and other periods of instability. It is a hallmark of a transitory phase. Such distorted pity requires vast prison complexes and overbloated legal systems that cost the taxpayers billions, while simultaneously not permitting the taxpayers to object to what their taxes are being spent on. The absence of a death penalty is an immense luxury and extravagance, and one that can be ill-afforded in hard times. The dissidence exists now. It did not exist in the past save as an obscure and mocked aspect of the fringe, and it will not exist in the future either. And it is a debate unique to the Christian West regardless. Should Christianity rise again from it's ashes, capital punishment for transgressions of the moral law will return. Should Christianity die off or be driven underground, capital punishment for slights against society and persons will return, because there are no grounds to plead redemption of any sort. Because that's how it works in China, Africa, SEA countries, and Arabia.

And this is an irrelevant conversation regardless. We aren't talking about real life. We're talking about a fictional story where the author attempts to shoehorn in an aesop and fails miserably at it. If Rowling wanted a plotline that extolls the virtues of mercy and forgiveness, then she failed. Likewise, if she wanted a story that made it clear that overlooking capital crimes was a wise and just decision, she also failed.

Here's the facts.

- Every marked Death Eater we know from the first war deserves to die. They all took the mark willingly, and they all did things that a normal society would either kill them for or imprison them for life with zero chance of release. You cannot name a single instance of someone from the first Voldemort war who bares a mark, where that person would not be better off dead or locked away forever in Azkaban. Since life in Azkaban is effectively a death sentence regardless. You can not name one single instance of a Death Eater from the first war who does not at least deserve life in Azkaban.
- 90% of all the problems in the story were caused by Death Eaters walking free. Had they been imprisoned for life or killed, Harry would not have needed to go to his relatives for his own safety, there would have been no one help resurrect Voldemort, and no one waiting to rejoin him if/when he did somehow eventually return. Lucius Malfoy's theoretical death alone subverts nearly the entire story.
- 100% of the problems that exist post-story existed because Death Eaters walked free AGAIN. Lucius Malfoy and Theodore Nott are the sole and entire cause of the problems in Cursed Child. If all marked Death Eaters and their known advocates and sympathizers had been rounded up and thrown into Azkaban or through the Veil, Delphini would have been found as an infant and raised properly by a family that cared for her, the super time turner would have never existed, and ridiculous shenanigans that entailed bad ends across a dozen different divergent timelines would have never happened.
- Nobody with a Dark Mark was innocent. GoF chapter 9 (The Dark Mark) makes it clear that Voldemort only gave them to loyal followers who had proved themselves and earned Voldemort's trust. This is further expounded and elaborated upon in DH chapter 23 (Malfoy Manor), where it is explicitly stated that only Voldemort's inner circle of supporters and followers were gifted with a mark: this is why Imperiused Death Eaters do not bare one, and also why employees and conscripts like the Snatchers don't have them either. So my claim, that all marked Death Eaters should be killed, is even further supported by the story itself. Anyone with a mark is de-facto guilty of high treason and conspiracy to commit genocide, as well as probable murder and rape. Any one of these crimes is traditionally punishable by death, and for good reason.
- While your appeal to extremism in an attempt to discredit my logic is cute, Stan Shunpike was under the Imperius Curse, as were thousands of others during the events of Deathly Hallows. He did not bare a Dark Mark. So your attempts to claim "you would have to kill Stan" are hollow and pedantic. Someone under the Imperius is not responsible for their own actions. Stan was arrested for running his mouth off like a moron in HBP and implying he had insider knowledge of Death Eater activity, and was then released from Azkaban and placed under the Imperius during the mass jailbreak staged by Voldemort. He's guilty of nothing but being an idiot. The person who put him under the Imperius, however, should absolutely be killed. And probably was, since it was likely Voldemort himself who did it.
- All of the faults with the designated "hard liners" like Crouch and Rufus lay in their still being too soft, not because they were hard line. Crouch, as far as we can tell, was wrong about only one thing in his entire career as a hard-liner, and it was putting Sirius away without a trial. However, that pales in comparison to his biggest mistake of all, which was not only allowing his son to live but taking pity on him and smuggling him out of Azkaban. Had Barty stuck to his guns, Voldemort's second resurrection would not have happened when it did. It may not have happened at all. So Barty's biggest mistake in the grand scheme of things was not being hardline ENOUGH, not being too much of a hardliner. The same is true of Rufus. He already knew who the marked Death Eaters were, but either could not or would not do anything about it. Instead, he wasted time harassing idiots like Stan. He was a hard liner in name only. So if Rowling wanted to try and show the PERILS of being against her own personal morals, she failed miserably at that as well.
- And finally, and most importantly of all, the aesop itself was a colossal failure. The purpose of an aesop or moral lesson in a story is to teach a lesson to the reader, to present them with a compelling (if arranged and contrived) argument designed to lead them to a conclusion. Given that, Rowling's attempts to convince people to forgive and disdain the death penalty were laughable. The fandom at large does not feel sympathy for canon!Snape or canon!Malfoys. There are thousands of pieces of fan fiction out there mocking the feeble, soft-handed stance the wizarding world took after the end of both wars. Many fans outright deny that the epilogue and anything past that in the timeline is canon, maintaining that all marked Death Eaters would have obviously been put to death or thrown in prison for life, and it's absurd to suppose anything different could have happened. If the goal of an aesop is to convince people that the writer of the aesop has a point, then Rowling's attempts to convince her fans to her way of thinking has by-definition failed. Which was the original point of my comment. Nobody is buying what Rowling is trying to sell. If she hates the death penalty so much, maybe she shouldn't have signed off on a post-epilogue story that involves Lucius Malfoy and Theodore Nott attempting to resurrect Tom Riddle AGAIN.

Rowling hates the death penalty but created a world where killing everyone with a tattoo was objectively the correct decision. Not a great look for her.

******* Killing even draco? Folks like thicknesse? Shunpike? And lmao there's nothing exclusively Christian about forgiveness and compassion. Even confucius has spoken of it. One way or the other the non west as you refer to it are largely third world which tends to have a disconnect between the majority populace and the people representing society and making laws, being holier than thou and dehumanizing rule breakers as monsters.

There absolutely are leftist movements for abolition of the capital punishment in the third world, for the very valid reason of constant overturn of death sentences and clear creed and prejudice dynamics. You can't consider principles like these merely in ideation. We rarely have civil wars with the elite aristocrats moonlighting as direct zealot terrorists. Your Principle is useless without considering the practical bias and error of judges and the bigotry innate to upper echelons of society.

It's a friggin joke to punish rape with death when until decades ago matrimony was institutionalised rape and arranged marriages still go on. Protesting rape is hardly conscience borne; it is about safeguarding a family's patriarchy.

Rowling didn't fail at moral high grounds. It would beat the point if they paid off in utilitarian terms. Even in the climax it's mentioned how dumbledore wouldn't kidnap death eaters' kids, how harry won't kill stan. And his mercy to wormtail paid off. His forgiveness for kreacher. Dumbledores of snape.

Death eaters are an ideology. Just like the order they too can spawn off without oversight or the original leaders. Harry could still be endangered.

Barty was 19 and absolutely could have become a greater person. He could have been lied to, brainwashed and manipilated. The mark is for loyalty, not clarity.

You're awfully deluded about the fandom demographics and opinions.

And lastly being anti capital punishment is hardly a motif ofnthe series. The series is about death, the living, moving on, the right and wrong ways to fight death. Books one, three, five, six and seven all address it. It is coming of age and deals with love and grief, and solidadity to an extent. It's not about compassionate sentencing lmao

  Killing even draco?
#+end_quote

A marked Death Eater, who performed multiple Unforgivable curses, who only did not murder Katie Bell and Ron Weasley by sheer dumb luck, who actively participated in sedition, treason, torture, and attempted genocide, who was an advocate of sedition, treason, torture, and genocide from the age of eleven, who has NEVER apologized for or recanted his views, and who does not regret the murders, attempted murders, and terrorist behavior.

Yes. I would kill Draco Malfoy. I would kill him on the treason charges alone, the rest is just icing on the cake. The sexual delusions of thousands of overweight, middle aged women who are closet pedophiles and want to diddle a young Tim Felton do not change reality. Draco Malfoy is a murderer and terrorist, he is a marked Death Eater and guilty of treason. He is only not a rapist by virtue of Rowling choosing to never reference sex once in the entire series, but given that he hung out in the rape dungeon beneath Malfoy Manor and participated in abusing Luna Lovegood and other captives, it is impossible to imagine he is not a rapist either. Though I will do you the dignity of not suggesting he should be killed for crimes of rape. Since he should be killed a dozen times over for other things, I hardly need the charge against him.

Any sane and just society would be arguing whether or not he should be imprisoned for life or simply put down the same way you would put down a dog that has gone rabid. Even by the laws of the wizarding world as we are shown, he is guilty of multiple crimes deserving automatic life sentences in Azkaban. How many automatic sentences of life in Azkaban do you think someone should rack up before we dispense with the frivolities and simply kill them? Three? Five? Draco is well past that number.

Harry Potter as a series is full of nonsensical choices and decisions by various characters. None are more absurd than the epilogue, which nearly every single member of the fandom hated, and rightfully so. It is an absurd travesty, and I will never let anyone pretend otherwise. Marked Death Eaters walking free a second time is proof that Rowling is delusional and that justice does not exist in her fictional universe. I cannot imagine a scenario in which Hermione, just to give one example, would simply accept that injustice and move on. Fortunately, the people who write fanfiction are not the least bit obligated to respect her awful opinions and bad writing.

Every marked Death Eater should have been killed. Until Azkaban had a breakout, you could argue that a life sentence there is a more merciful equivalent, but that hinges upon the notion that they will never be a threat to society again. The moment it became clear that Death Eaters could simply leave or be broken out, every marked Death Eater should have been kissed, executed, or thrown through the veil. In a world where everyone believes Sirius Black was Voldemort's right hand man, there is no excuse for any imprisoned Death Eater living past the end of the third book.

There are no excuses at all to justify the joke of an epilogue, or the joke of an extended universe Rowling has decided to keep tacking on to the end of a story she promised really was going to be the end.

********* Treason and sedition? Lmao, do you think state is some inherently good supreme ideal? Heights of privilege and selfishness.

I'm not a draco fan lmao, take your closeted misogyny elsewhere.

He did change his views anywhere.

Rape dungeon? Impossiboe to imagine he isn't? You're probably the type who thinks men cant control themselves if women are nude or scanty in public then. More and more confirmation you're a socially conservative sexist bigot wanting to purge society of criminal races and lock women up as housewives.

You're absolutely delusional, hating the epilogue is a small cult. To most readers it's a story about harry and how he found Happiness.

Azkabans dementors were removed so I don't see why there's a risk of break out. Just because your holy state isn't perfect at prison maintennace doesn't mean you execute every convict.

Time and again education and social welfare have shown to be better at reducing crimes. Retribution isn't justice and deterrence will never work.

*** I agree with everything you said, however I simply don't think I would personaly writte occlumency completely like that, ever

The main reason why, would be that I don't see that as a magical art at all. A non-wizard could easily learn occlumency as you described it, which would be fine, if you have a muggle main character.

But if you have a wizard main character, then I feel learning this occlumency is not magical enough for you to bother, unless you want to learn to disassociate and self hypnotize

**** I understand what you're trying to say. Occlumency explicitly exists to fight Legilimency, that is stated to be true. So the argument would be that Occlumency is something you have to be magical to learn, because you can't "defeat" a spell like Legilimency without using some kind of magic to stop it. Only magic can fight magic, in other words.

Rowling isn't consistent here. There's no practical reason a muggle or squib couldn't become a potion's master. However, Rowling has at various points stated that all potions need to be finished by casting a spell on them (something we never see in the books and which Snape's own comments contradict (there will be no silly wand waving in my class)) or that you have to BE magical inherently in order for assembling the potion to turn out correctly. You can pick whichever you like, but the bottom line is that you apparently have to be inherently magical for certain things to work at all.

I guess the question is, where do you draw the line? Is potions a magical art? Astronomy? Herbology? Care? Runes? Arithmancy? As far as I can tell, a squib or muggle could theoretically pass their OWLs, as long as they're willing to take a dive on Charms and Transfiguration. And I think that might be the reason Rowling tried to insist that you do, in fact, have to be magical to see or interact with certain things. It's to explain why squibs are such total outcasts, among other things.

If it makes you feel any better, I have a personal headcanon that mastering Occlumency gives the Occlumens a form of perfect recall. So they can memorize things at a glance and recall the precise details of anything they have ever seen. I believe this to be plausible because mastering the manipulation of your own memories, to hide them away, would also entail being able to do the opposite: to push certain memories up to the forefront of your mind. If you can do that, then do you not, in fact, have a form of perfect recollection? An accomplished Occlumens should, by definition, have an eidetic/photographic memory.

So if Occlumency seems too mundane as it exists in canon, you can always consider the advantages mastering it would give someone, like a photographic memory, or the ability to flawlessly bluff and lie. I'd imagine it would be much more difficult to duel or fight someone who had no tells, so a skilled Occlumens would be a more dangerous fighter as well.

*** I'm not entirely sure if that description is completely accurate. Snape, when he first starts "teaching" Harry Occlumency, tells him that it would be similar to resisting the Imperious Curse, thus implying that it DOES come down to a battle of willpower. Advanced Occlumency, which Snape is implied to be capable of, does seem to involve an element of misdirection.

****** Actually, it does. Psycho Mantis was a Metal Gear Solid 1 boss whose gimmick was the ability to read the minds of his enemies and pre-empt their attacks. Plugging your controller into the second port made fighting him easier and, well, the idea was so unusual that it became a meme.

Nat over there was merely taking the supposition further by supplanting or contrasting HP characters with their potential MGS parralels. Which won't work because you won't find a good replacement for Big Boss anywhere methinks.

** Hmm.Fanon has different takes on occlumency.for e.g. HP and the Prince of Slytherin which is a amzing fic shows that there are 7 layers to occlumency and legillemency and each layer gives different benefits but there also natural occlumens and legilimens. Natural legilimens come in different shapes and forms but the most common would be sherlock holmes. e.g. if harry in PoS was natural legilimens,he would connect seemingly insignificant info,read peoples facial expressions,body language,tone etc.. and make unbelievable deductions and know secrets of people. But in Pos occlumency and legillemency can also save lives,slow time and more.If it sounds interesting to you,you should read Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin.The fic is just amazing.
