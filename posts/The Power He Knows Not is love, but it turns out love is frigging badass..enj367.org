** Three words: Babylonian Battle Whores. The bible tried to warn people, but people interpreted it the wrong way. Watch Harry defeat the Dark Lord by conquering the wives of Death Eaters.

*** Heh, read a fic where Harry determined the Dark Mark was a modified bonding ritual. Harry, Sirius and allies managed to get the Wizengot to recognize the original bond, and it's derivatives, as legal marriages.

So legally, Voldemort married each of his Marked Death Eaters. This caused the Death Eaters to break any existing marriage contracts, giving the ex-wives very lopsided settlements and leaving Voldemort's organization broke. And there may be magical consequences is the marriage isn't consummated.

All of this was accidental. Harry intended to just publish a wedding announcement in the Daily Prophet as a prank.

** "So Harry, you have come to die."

"Not today Tom. I actually didn't come alone. You may have minions, but I have friends."

Suddenly a three foot teddy bear with a heart on it's white belly stepped out of the Forbidden Forrest and spoke in a sugary sweet voice that made Voldemort twitch, "And friendship can never be defeated!"

Another teddy bear, this one teal with a rainbow on it's belly appeared, "You said it Tenderheart! Ready?!"

More teddy bears stepped out of the forrest to surround the clearing. It was enough to make the assembled Death Eaters step back in confusion at the army of pastel bears, no not all bears, there was a lion and an elephant mixed in.

The first bear to speak, the one called Tenderheart, spoke again, "Care Bear countdown! 5!"

The small lion roared, "4!"

Another, a yellow bear called, "3!"

"2!"

"1!"

As one the assembled teddy bears shouted, "CARE!" And brilliant beams of energy erupted from the bear's tummys to bathe Voldemort and the assembled Death Eaters in the power of pure friendship and love.

** Well canon power of love was strong enough to block the unblockable curse and rebound it! If only they did more with THAT, like a general super immunity to dangerous curses, or like cleansing souls of evil and repairing Voldemort by force, or maybe purifying a horcrux so it can be good and fight his main self...

There are so many interesting ideas for this! Canon did waste it. :(

**** It's not priori incantatem as much as brother wands. Amos Diggory performs priori incantatem on Harry's wand earlier in book 4, but if you were to point your want at a wand that's AK'ing you, it doesn't seem like that would help.
