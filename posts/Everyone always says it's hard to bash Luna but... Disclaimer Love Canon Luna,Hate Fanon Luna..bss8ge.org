***** So, basically,

*Before:* A fandom with hundreds, perhaps thousands of bashers.

*After:* 1 basher who only has 24 hours in a day to bash.

I'll take that deal.

** Fanon Luna is the worst.

Im sorry but I've yet to see one decent Luna depiction that isnt either stupid, overpowered or outright dumbs down everybody around her.

*** I agree completely. It's even worse when literally every other Ravenclaw is part of some hivemind that exists solely to bully Luna when in canon the bullying was very likely restricted to three or four girls in her dormitory

**** I don't think I've ever read a fic where the ENTIRE house was bullying her. It always seems to me that most people at least know it's happening in the fanfics where it happens. I mean, they were stealing her shit and hiding them on banisters in the movies/books, so others had to have known.

*** I like her depiction as more a forward thinking, slightly gullible figure. So she believes in all the creatures, but never immediately dismisses anything. I think an adult Luna would possibly be an interesting character to read, because she got over the fact her father was wrong and she is still an open-minded explorer.

**** So you wrote a post saying how hate fanon Luna... Except you don't, because you never actually ran across what you describe. And I've never seen anyone ever say that a certain character can't ever be ruined.

In summary, your post is completely pointless.

Did I get everything right?

***** Modern antivax movement /is/, largely, a conspiracy movement.

Also, people who believe in one kind of grand conspiracy (e.g., that 9/11 was an inside job) usually believe in others as well (e.g., that moon landings were faked).
