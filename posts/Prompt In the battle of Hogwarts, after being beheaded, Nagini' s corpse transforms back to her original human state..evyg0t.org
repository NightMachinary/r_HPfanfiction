According to the Crimes of Grindelwald, Nagini was originally a human who due to a blood malediction gradually and permanently became a snake.

** And then Neville has to feel horrible about it and cope with it in a super emotional post war fic that he literally decapitated another human being. :( Yes and then he goes to learn about her past life and her curse in Crimes of Grindelwald events. :(

**** Well, killing a snake is easier than killing a human, especially if the said human is older than your grandmother.

** The whole thing illustrates perfectly why I dislike the two new movies - everything has to be connected for some reason. Like, why does the story have to be about Dumbledore, and Nagini, and why do all these characters have to have links and references and connections to people we already know? It just doesn't feel right, more like a sitcom or a soap opera setting than an actual movie. I'd have much preferred a movie about completely new people with no connection to the books, except for the world and its magic system.

So yeah, do a young Newt, but don't bring dumbledore, and Nagini, and Grindelwald, and whoeverthefuck into the movie, do an original villain!

** With all the things that are badly done in this film I'll consider it doesn't exist and Nagini is just a big snek.

*** Not exactly a plot-hole. We don't know that her body should have returned to it's original form. That's just an assumption about the established rules of a fictional universe.
