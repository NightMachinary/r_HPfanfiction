Hello,

Recently I've been caught in a HP crossover mood again, but I kinda want to try something different this time, especially after encountering some HP/LotR and HP/SW crossovers that I really liked, while I was initially sure the idea wouldn't work. So, do you know any crossover fics with HP with fandoms that are less commontly used, that have at least 50k words? I'd also request for the main character to be Harry, but can be heavily AU - I tend to not mind protagonist OOC-ness, especially if there's an explanation for why :3

I like relationships, but they're not a must - if they are present, for crossover stories I tend to prefer Harry with someone from the other universe. I'm a bit meh on OCs as a main character, and my only hard NO's are Harry/Ginny and Harry/Ron.

No Naruto and Marvel please, since I'm routinely digging through those, and as for Lord of the Rings and Star Wars I'm currently on a Google frenzy for these - I'm specifically interested in crossovers with fandoms I haven't tried yet.

Thank you!

  COMPLETE. Firefly: :Harry Potter crossover Post Serenity. Two years have passed since the secret of the planet Miranda got broadcast across the whole 'verse in 2518. The crew of Serenity finally hires a new pilot, but he's a bit peculiar.

It takes place right after the end of Serenity the movie, but otherwise there isn't too much I can think of that you would need to know. Maybe a quick Wikipedia read through of Firefly will get you up to date on the canon.

*** linkffn(The Havoc side of the Force) and the companion piece linkffn(The Unsuspecting side of the Force) got me really hooked up on the crossover :D!! I also quite liked Wild Child by molmcmahon on ao3 - it's a short-ish (30k words) fic and it's m/m, so not everyone's cup of coffee, but it has a nice focus on Harry and Anakin meeting as children, which I'd love to see more of.. there's also Finishing the Hat by The_Carnivorous_Muffin, but thats like, a crossover au of a crossover au of a fanfic xDD I enjoyed it greatly, but unless you're a fan of the author's other works, it'd be hard to see where the HP is xD

But sadly that's pretty much it, haven't found anything else good for these two series :(. If you know anything worth recommending, please do!

** Have you ever read/watched Bleach? I know it's frequently crossed with HP but one of my favorite fics of all time is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6165374/1/Waiting-in-Sin][Waiting in Sin]] by JerichosPhantom. It seems like a pretty typical Ulquiorra is reborn as Harry fic and starts out with not much differences from the original, but it gets better and better as little things are changed that cause ripples throughout the universe. I particularly like it bc they don't just make Harry OP as fuck, they kinda give it time and write it so it makes sense. It's a little cracky and self-indulgent but I enjoyed it so much and I reread it every once in a while. It's also 215k words so it's a loooong read.

3 Inheritance Cycle x-over, 2 of them are fairly similar in their premise (one is based of the other) and have femHarry. The other is a MoD!Harry that is quite the OP fucker, but its really interesting the way he changes the history of Alagaesia. You can read all 3 without having read Eragon, but I'd say it would be better if you did so you can compare them.

2 Twilight xover, one quite comical and lighthearted. The other is different kind of MoDHarry, and I loved the way the romance goes in this and I absolutely loved Rosalie here. It can get a bit heavy on the angst, but it was fine for me.

A Sword Art Online fic that changes both universes by having Harry be sent into Aincrad during the release of SAO. To be honest, I stopped halfway because when I was reading, a new expansion of PoE came out and I forgot about it later on. It was quite fun and fairly consistent with canon SAO.

  With the inheritance style crossover, I feel like a lot of thought needs to go into how the magic systems interact
#+end_quote

This is explained fairly well in both fics, and each has a different approach to it.

About Chrysochlorous, I get what you're saying, but I honestly haven't felt that way about it. For me, Rose stays, personality-wise, as close to canon as possible, IF she didn't have Emmet. So I'd say she's the perfect balance of whiny and adoration towards Harry, who basically saved her from her loneliness. Some might that's unhealthy, but what can we do...

I do agree a with the fact that Harry being physically on par with vampires is too much. If you wanted for him to compete with vamps, just give him speed, not strenght as well. Though, he is still fragile and killable-ish.

** This post is exactly what I was looking for. I'll come back to this and read most of the stories in here. For my recommendations, linkffn(Hadrian Lannister Lion of the Rock) is a great game of thrones/hp crossover. If you're interested in GOT crossovers I can recommend a few more after checking my reading history. Another got crossover; linkffn(Reborn: Into the Wild Westeros) . Another type of crossover I like is HP/ Percy Jackson. For this I can recommend linkffn(Third Life) and stories of Engineer4Ever. They are pretty awesome. I have a few more Percy Jackson crossovers if anyone's interested.

  Certainly it seemed they were expected as they faced no resistance to their entrance and people parted as they rode onwards to the makeshift sables where they dismounted from their horses and stable boys appeared to rest and feed their mounts after such a long journey which had left Hadrian and the rest of the Lannister men tired and irritated and Hadrian in little mood to pander to the whims of the idiot Tyrell lord but given he would be surrounded by nearly a hundred thousand of his men it was best that he humour him a little.

Also, one more question if you don't mind: how much magic from HP-verse does the reincarnated Harry use in the GoT setting? I've tried looking for several key terms (accio, legilimency, occlumency, AK, etc), and it had none. So maybe he makes some potions and stuff?

In other words, what skills of this “Hadrian Lannister” make his status of a reincarnated Harry Potter affect the way he solves problems instead of it being an [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility][irrelevant]] background history?

****** Ok good question and I will try to answer it but I haven't read the story recently. May contain some spoilers. Magic in Westeros is dead and Hadrian doesn't have a wand so he can't use much magic. He can use some wandless magic but not enough. He tries to bring magic back to Westeros but don't expect big Magics for a long time. I suggest you give it a chance and read a little bit. The story kinda pulls you in

*** Thanks for the recommendations! Out of curiosity, is the Pokemon one with a serious plot, or crack/crack treated seriously? All Pokemon fics I tried so far had a somewhat weird tone, haha

** One of my favorites is [[[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheTrinity](The]] Trinity). It's a Nasuverse (Fatr/Stay Night/Tsukihime) crossover, and the seventh "book" is at the battle of Hogwarts currently.

There's no Harry in this one, but his canon traits are split up between the titular Trinity. It's a fun read.

*** Omg I am a big Nasuverce enthusiast, sadly the lack of Harry makes me a bit less interested, but it stil sounds like something I'd like to try - is it available for mobi download somewhere, I only saw a mention of it being on a forum?

  A Holy Grail War is brewing... but this is not your usual Holy Grail War. In this universe, the Masters and their Servants are converging on England to do battle. Nobody is quite sure where such a potent artefact came from - not the Church, not the Iranians, not the Japanese, not the mercenary, not the thrall of Voldemort, not the werewolves - but everyone has something they want out of it, and one Harry James Potter gets involved when he accepts the invitation in order to save Sirius Black during the events at the end of [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix][/Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix/]]. Now part of this fracas, it's up to him and his Servant to step up to the bat and win... or die trying.

** Harry Five-0 linkffn(10836553)

Its a Hawaii Five-0/Lilo&stich/NCIS-LA/DC/Bones. It's a wholesome fic, thats got some cool scenes with Harry being a badass living in Hawaii. He works for the Government, and looks after Lilo. Its a weird premise but it hooks you real quick.

** Harry Potter and the Natural 20 is quite unusual, I think. linkffn(8096183)

It's better if you know D&D' rules but you can appreciate it without that (I actually don't know the rules myself...)

This is long, but incomplete. Irregularly updated, the author has MANY WIPs. A lot of them crossovers.

Also... Slash harem jsyk.
