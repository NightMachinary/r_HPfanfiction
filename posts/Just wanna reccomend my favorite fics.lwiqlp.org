#+begin_quote
  Growing up as a Kneazle is tricky, especially when you realize you might be human, too. Add in posessed professors, sinister snakes, and more detentions than he can count, and Harry's Hogwarts career has certainly been memorable. What will he do when he faces his biggest challenge yet? Being a teenager isn't easy no matter what species you are. Sequel to 'Growing Up Kneazle'
