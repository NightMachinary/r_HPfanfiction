I was wondering if there were any fics about harry becoming a pirate or a sailor?


** I don't remember the name, but there's an AU/Marauders Era fic where Harry poses as Aberforth's Squib Bartender and ends up spending an arc on the crew of a Pirate who frequents the Hog's Head.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

** The only pirate fic I've seen was one of the weirder Harmony fics where the two teens get BDSM sex education and encouragement from Hermione's parents to the point where her mother is encouraging Harry to tie Hermione to a cannon. The pirate plot itself is alright (he goes full in on the learning how to pirate thing and there's a dash of politics in there too), but the romance plot is just bizarre and disconcerting enough that it kind of overpowers the rest (in my opinion, anyway). I don't remember it being graphic though (but it has been an age since I read it).

I can't link for the obvious reasons, but on the offchance you're interested in reading it, it's called 'Rocking the Boat' and it's by DerLaCroix - I've linked their profile below. Check out the warning in their profile, as they really mean it. :D

** linkao3(Harry Potter and the Pirates of the Caribbean by GoldenHeroes) is a crossover, as its name suggests. It hasn't reached the parts with actual pirates and piracy yet, but it's off to a pretty good start.

linkao3(13: Till Morning by TheLastFounder) has Harry as Captain Hook and Peter Pan as a lovecraftian horror.

** Harry, after first/second/third/whatever year, decides F*** the dursleys, he has magic! He and at least one female friend find the right book at Hogwarts, borrow it over the summer and build a raft that takes them to a shipwreck in international waters. Together, they start casting a complex spell, then suddenly start to sing: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo7XPvwRgG8]]

When it's over, they have their own salvaged ship that can take them anywhere on the oceans. They've prepared for this though, and bring out pirate hats and quickly cast a color-change spell on Hedwig. Maybe they have an elf, maybe not. In short order, they have a number of plants growing on deck, magically protected from salt, they fish when they want to and start expanding the rooms for all their needs. Perhaps they find Potter/Black Island, or a warded island whose owners died. Maybe you could even have them start a project to trigger an underwater volcano and build their own!

Image the return to Hogwarts, they're not on the train, when suddenly that song starts to play, with everyone singing along and Harry's ship sails out of the mists of the lake using *PIRATE MAGIC!*
