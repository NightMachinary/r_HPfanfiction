Lately I've been wanting to become a beta reader, especially as I find myself with a lot of free time on my hands. I have been reading fanfiction for over 10 years and I'd like to become more involved in the fanfiction community. My main fandom is Harry Potter, but I do read others so if you write in other fandoms as well please let me know.

I did look into creating a beta reader profile on FFN; however, the requirements for five published works or 6000 words is difficult for me. In my personal writing I stick to academic papers, articles, and other pieces of non-fiction that do not qualify for FFN.

That being said, I do have experience editing academic papers, articles, non-fiction, fiction, and other creative writing works at a university level. My strengths are spelling, grammar, punctuation, flow, and continuity. I am also good for bouncing ideas off of, providing ideas to fill plot holes, and helping to flesh out characterizations. My weakness is the flow of romantic scenes (especially dialogue).

I have no problems reading any type of fanfiction. For example, slash or horror does not scare me off. I would prefer not to read explicit femslash or non-consensual sex scenes but if they make up only a small part of your story I am still up for it.

If you would be interested in having me as your beta please let me know. I would be willing to provide a sample of some of my writing to you in a PM.


** This sub should probably have a monthly beta thread

** I would definitely be interested. If you're still available when you read this, send me a PM pls.

My story that is in dire need of a beta is The Salem Settlement. Can't link it because I'm on mobile, but Google spits it out easily enough.

** I'm about to start publishing a fic I've been working on for a loooooooooong time, and I wouldn't say no to a bit of help! It's an All Original Characters fanfiction set in Beauxbatons. Would you be interested? If yes, just take a look at [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4a04wy/discussion_does_this_prologue_compel_you_to_read/][this]] ;)

*** I never considered Tumblr as it isn't a social media outlet I generally use. Thanks for the tip!
