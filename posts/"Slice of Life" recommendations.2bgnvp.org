I love action as much as the next guy, but sometime I really want a story that focuses more on the day-to-day than setting up for the next big Plot Point. Am I crazy? Any fics out there that fit that description?


** Anything by the TheEndless seems to be what you're looking for if you don't mind mostly romance.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4367121/1/The-First-Day][The First Day]] centers around the year after the books end. It's Harry/Ginny done well, imo. Basically no action and almost completely character driven. It's definitely one of my favorite HP fanfics. Beware though, emotions from the characters are heavy with the death in the Weasley family and all.

** Not sure if it would be considered slice of life exactly but I found it refreshingly easy going and charming.\\
"Harry grows up working on his Aunts Garden and develops a love for it"\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7511960/1/It-s-Green]]

It may not seem like much at first but Harry is like 6 so starts very childlike - I would recommend giving it to chapter 10 as chapters are short.

It has little adventures but really Quirrelmort and his destiny etc. - well they seem so distant they may as well not exist (up to last update at least). It was the perfect change of pace for me after reading intense action filled fics and dark dramas so give er a go!

*** Sounds interesting, but I'm not up to the heartache of a story that hasn't updated in almost a year :(

** Do you mind, like, school life, coming-of-age tales? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4760090/1/The-World-Shall-Brightly-Burn][Here's]] one that follows Remus's time at Hogwarts, and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2489360/1/A-Keen-Observer][here's]] one that follows Andromeda's, how her sisters came to be the way there were, and how she ended up with Ted. Both of them are exceptional reads and fairly long.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8335371/1/Butterbeer-at-9-AM][Bonus]]: a one-shot I just stumbled upon that has a meeting between Lockhart and Lupin at the Leaky Cauldron.
