Preferably gen. No extraordinary powers, no bashing really. Just life at the Weasleys.

Thanks in advance!


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1344409][FloreatCastellum]] has a lot of slice-of-life fics featuring the Weasleys.

** “Weasley Family Picnic” cycle by Antosha starting with linkffn(2009858). Certainly not gen though. There is nothing graphic, but it is all about romantic relationships, and if you have problem with post-16 teenagers sleeping together, avoid it.
