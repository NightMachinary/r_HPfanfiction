It might be cliche or trope'y.. But hit me with fics where someone loses their shit over the lack of safety in Snape's classes..

With people melting cauldrons, handling noxious, poisonous and generally dangerous materials in class.. I don't particularly care how brilliant Poppy Pomphrey is, somebody would've ended up leaving Hogwarts in a bodybag.. And that's before considering any of the inter-house rivalry bullshit..


** Oh! There's a fic, think it was a oneshot where all the repeated incomplete potions exploding on kids made them infertile... I'll see if I can find it!

It would be on ffn

It's about halfway through that it becomes part of the plot

** I wrote a fic called Professor Strange. Doctor Strange gets hired as DADA professor, and many things happen. One of them being - he uses astral projection to observe Snape's lessons and then becomes a whistleblower.

** I remember that theres a story where this happens but I don't remember the name. In it, im pretty sure Vernon and petunia blocked harry from going to hogwarts until the triwizard tournament, when the ministry helped him emancipate himself. He refuses the take potions without safety features and hires a potion mistress as a teacher instead.

** Lab safety is addressed in The Pureblood Pretense, but Professor Snape is actually doing a good job of it (it's an AU where Lily is alive and well, though they're estranged, so he's not /quite/ as bitter and twisted). Aisles wide enough that robes don't brush against workstations, instructions on the board so that textbooks don't need to be near open flames, environment chilled to stabilise ingredients, and he himself prevents quite a lot of explosions, even though he's not very kind about it.
