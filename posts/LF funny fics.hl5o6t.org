I'm simply looking for the funniest fics you know of. Stuff like Potter Ever After linkffn(Potter Ever After) would be preferred, but you can recommend whatever you want.


** Probably the closest I know of to that kind of humour is linkffn(Seventh Horcrux).

If you like dry humour with a bit less meta in it, I can firmly recommend linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions). It occasionally sticks suspiciously close to the stations of canon, but it's well enough written to pull it off, and hilarious.

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

** Abandoned and never finished, but hands down one of the funniest and well thought out and fleshed out international wizardimg world fics I've ever read [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3542099/1/How-I-Learned-To-Stop-Worrying-And-Love-Lord-V][How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Lord Voldemort]]

Nuclear war. Voldemort had placed a world stasis spell in the 50s to go off in the event of nuclear war, and only very powerful wizards will be immune. Unfortunately, most of the wizards powerful enough to be immune are.... Fucking ancient and don't even know about basic electricity or science.

Harry is immune as well because horcrux or whatever.

Voldemort is such a character in this, sassy witty paranoid deranged sharp obsessive academic. Would be an okay fic if it were just pure crack, but there were some really abstract and sombre moments that really elevates this fic.

I will forever be sad that it was never finished, but grateful that it's still available to read.

** I did not read Potter Ever After but I am always laughing in [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/TheLoud/pseuds/TheLoud][TheLoud's]] stories.

Edit: Okay, that story is definitely a different genre of humor.

  Between marriage contracts, soul bonds, angry fathers, wandering eyes, backstabbing women, and defiant house elves, Harry has a feeling that 'True Love' isn't in the cards for him in this story. Which is just fine by him, as it turns out. A depressing walkthrough of the current state of HP Fanfiction.

  Harry's 16th Birthday is to be spent at Privet Drive. A visit from Tonks and then the Minister leads to some fireworks in Harry's usually quiet, peaceful life. HONKS.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
