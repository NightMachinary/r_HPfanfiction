** /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die][Too Young to Die]]/ (WL: 194,707; Complete). Though Harry here is more of a sociopath than a violent psychopath --- so no torture for torture's sake, if that's what you're requesting.

There's also a bunch of crappy HP\TMR stories and premises like that, but since all off them that I've seen so far were really badly done, I won't bother looking them up.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  I'm sick of the manipulation, the lies and the deceit; sick of jumping to the tune of dark lords and old puppeteers. I'm cutting the strings. Innocents will pay in blood for my defiance, but I no longer care. I lost my innocence long ago. Dark!Harry

  Harry Potter is disappointed by the Wizarding World. A society wielding powers beyond imagination and it is wasted on Politics and Games. A psychotic Harry Potter aims to remind the world what it means to be a Wizard and to judge who is Worthy of Magic and who isn't.
