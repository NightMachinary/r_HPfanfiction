** I don't mean to be rude, but it has come to my attention that you post once a day every day on this subreddit. It's nice that you do and all! But, like why? Are you not satisfied with the stories you are daily recommended? How quickly do you read exactly that you need new reading material every day?

*** I read that fast. I prefer 70k+ words and will finish a story in a sitting. So I think it's reasonable that this person might just be going through it that quickly.

*** I read incredibly fast, so most fics I finish within a few hours.

  Harry Potter, the first nullifier since Salazar Slytherin, doesn't feeling like playing the hero. But when he goes back to the time of the Founders to learn from Slytherin himself, he finds himself in the middle of a war, trapped by enemies old and new.
