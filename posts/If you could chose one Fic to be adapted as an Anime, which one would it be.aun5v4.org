** The most entertaining would definitely be My Immortal. Even beyond 30 Hs, My Immortal would be the unquestioned emperor of 'so bad it's good.'

*** 30H's would definitely be animated like a Rob Zombie comic though.

** I'd prefer original flavor HP be an anime.

Some people would hate it, because "Chinese cartoons are for children!!!" but I'd enjoy official Harry Potter media that pays respect to canon without trying to break it like Fantastic Beasts or Cursed Child do.

  Last fic in the trilogy! Demons invaded Earth intent on enslaving all magical life. But they miscalculated...the Earthling's magic is stronger than they suspected, and far more dangerous. Now the survivors regroup in the new magical world, to fight back.

** I'd hafta say Prince of the Dark Kingdom, personally, but there are also plenty of fics that just aren't suited for their medium (lookin' at you, Prince of Slytherin), so it'd be cool to see some of those adapted to one that might fit them better.

** A good follow-up question could be, "What style would best suit that fic?"

The first year of /Harry Crow/ I've already imagined in Tite Kubo's style (before you ask, /yes/, Dumbledore is Yamamoto, and Sirius would be Zangetsu.) I haven't read it past the Soul Bond™

/30H's/ gets the Rob Zombie, /The Haunted World of El Superbeasto/ treatment (no it's not anime, but can it really be anything else?)

/My Immortal/ can /try/ to get the Takeshi Obata treatment (ala /Death Note/), but it'll end up looking like a doujin parody (and not one of the ones I'd say are drawn well)

Kouta Hirano, /The Nightmare Man/, no discussion. We're talking the full Hellsing, in both the really gory parts, /and/ the funny Seras parts.

/The Merging/ has a Nobuhiro Watsuki vibe to me. (/Rurouni Kenshin/)

All of my favorite crackfics are mentally drawn by either the people who did FLCL, or for the more "serious" ones (or anything by Rorschach's Blot), Hideki Ohwada, the guy who drew /Mudazumo Naki Kaikaku/, best known for "Super Aryan Hitler".

/The Accidental Animagus/ gets Yoshihiro Togashi of /Hunter×Hunter/. I literally picture Harry as a black-haired Killua.

It's hard to pin down a style for the inwardtransience stuff, to be honest. I want to say Lynn Okamoto of /Elfen Lied/, add the flash step.

I liked /Psychosis/ by SnowWhiteOwl. That one gets drawn like /Higurashi/ in my head.

I think that's all I got for now. Any thoughts?
