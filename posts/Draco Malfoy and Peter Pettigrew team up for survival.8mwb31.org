  "He -- he was taking over everywhere! Wh-what was there to be gained by refusing him?" -Peter Pettigrew

  "I haven't got any options! I've got to do it! He'll kill me! He'll kill my whole family!" -Draco Malfoy

  "Your devotion is nothing more than cowardice. You would not be here if you had anywhere else to go." -Voldemort

It occurs to me that Peter Pettigrew and Draco Malfoy (at least later on) have something in common; they both work for Voldemort under duress.

So, does anyone have any fanfics where Wormtail and Malfoy team up to get away not just from the Death Eaters, but also from the 'good guys'?


** I think I recognise Voldemort and Draco's lines (graveyard and Slughorn's x-mas party,) but is the first one actual dialogue from the books? As for recs on that theme I haven't seen any where Draco and Peter team up, although I have seen them sharing space in Spinner's End but the relationship was acrimonious.

*** Fairly certain Peter's lines are from the confrontation in the Shrieking Shack in PoA.

**** Yup. Peter's line is from the end of Prisoner of Azkaban (when being confronted by Sirius & Lupin), Voldemort's line is from the start of Goblet of Fire (the Riddle House, while being eavesdropped on by Frank Bryce), and Draco's line is from the end of Half-Blood Prince (at the top of the Astronomy tower, having disarmed Dumbledore).
