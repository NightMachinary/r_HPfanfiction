I've always thought a really viable idea for an AU Harry Potter Fanfiction would be to rewrite the Order of the Phoenix having Dumbledore be upfront with Harry, just like how in hindsight he should have.

But barring that, any generally mostly canon compatible AU year five stories sounds good. (Yes I know canon compatible AU is a contradiction in terms, but I mean the divergences don't majorly contradict canon things besides events, so basically no time travel/super powers/inheritance)


** It would be nice to see Dumbledore Confounding Umbridge to not be a bitch.

*** I've done that in one story last year. Not exactly confounding her not to be a bitch, but making her think that her plan had worked and Harry was now cowed.
