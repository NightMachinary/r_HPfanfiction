Marvel crossovers that have a limited amount of marvel characters (I can't tell them all apart) (I would rather just have the "main" ones such as Spider-Man iron man loki thor dc strange) and are easy to follow for people who don't know the whole storyline before infinity war. Also preferably decent length. Thanks you
