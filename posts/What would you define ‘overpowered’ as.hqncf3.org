I wanna write a fic or a one shot where Harry is way over powered, like super powerful I don't know if he will take full advantage of it or not yet, but I don't really know what counts as op Anyone able to give me some examples? (Preferably not in the form of a fic or one shot, but a comment if possible) üòã thanks ‚ö°Ô∏è

Edit: if possible, please put your explanation into the simplist words possible because I'm pretty dumb and can't do long words thanks üòÖüòÇüòÇ


** It's quite simple. Overpowered means powerful enough to stagnate the plot before the climactic battle due to lack of conflict, to decrease the threat of opponents such that the result of the various conflicts is not in question, or inflate the strength of combatants enough to break immersion due to absurdity, disgust, or disbelief, your choice.

Thus, it should be noted that "overpowered" necessarily implies a negative characteristic of a fic, as all the potential consequences of it decrease the quality and enjoyment of story; however, if you are a skilled enough writer, there is no such thing as overpowered. As long as your plot (or humor if it's a comedy) can accommodate an extremely powerful character than you'll be fine.

An example of how to make a powerful character that isn't overpowered might include presenting your protagonist with different conflicts other than combat. Personal conflict is just as powerful a motivator as physical (or magical) conflict, and writing about a supremely powerful individual presents a potentially interesting set of circumstances.

Don't make your characters so powerful that the fights are too easy. Stories aren't as fun when you already know who's going to win. That or focus on the drama so there is still something that the main character has to work for.

I really like the way you put this. It's a great way of expressing that thought. :)

EDIT - Also, to answer OP, I totally second all of this.

** - he has multiple, if not infinity, animagus forms, some of which are magical beasts

- the same, but for patronus. his patronus could also be a dragon, or a T-Rex. (it's usually just thestral though)

- he can do powerful wandless and nonverbal magic. (he does this in lots of fics, but if it's just like a lumos, or accio, then it's fine. if it's in a duel, that's OP)

- he excels in all muggle martial arts, can outrun a lion, can lift a Hagrid, can overswim a merman, is better at bow and arrows than centaurs

- is a seer

- can fly (without broom)

- can apparate anywhere, including warded places. like Hogwarts.

- knows runes, alchemy and arithmancy (whatever that is)

- has some trinkets that keep him safe. basilisk scales armor shirt, a protective pendant he got from Death...

- best buddy of Death. (or their master, whichever works)

- has access to all the vaults of Potter, Black, Slytherin, Gryffindor, (usually not the other two), Peverell, Dumbledore (if he is death at the time and not being bashed), Death itself, Merlin (because of course, Lily was Merlin's descendant)

- every female or male is throwing themselves at him

- has scars (more than in canon, a lot are facial or on chest/back), and tattoos. one of his tattoo is a snake and he can speak with it.

- he has multiple pets (none of which is Hedwig), one of them is a basilisk. one is a pheonix.

** "Overpowered" is a term that compares you to your enemies. So in a normal, light Harry fic, Harry would be considered overpowered if he could wipe the floor with Voldemort, or whoever the main big bad was. Dark!Harry would be overpowered if he could wipe the floor with Dumbledore. Independant!Harry can't be anything but overpowered by definition.

** Can he fight Dumbledore to a draw? Can he fight Voldemort and draw? If yes, Harry is overpowered.

** I've read one fanfic where Harry was overpowered it wasn't any one power it was just that he kept getting more and more new, unique powers/animagus form/friends in high places. For no reason. I think a good OP Harry fic will have reasons why he gets his powers. Good luck!
