So this story was recently updated [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling]] and I've got to say it's an amazing fic.

Anyone have any recommendations of a story similar?


** Do you mean a story about a character being sorted into Slytherin and the changes that occur? Or a character study?

*** To be honest I've loved the development of the character. It isn't your cliche "sorted into Slytherin, character drastically changes" kind of story.

I guess I'm more looking towards a story that seems believable enough for the character to still seem them selves, yet given a different option and how they'd deal with it.

**** Okay, thanks for clarifying.

I'm going to recommend the only damn story centered on Draco "I'm a pathetic daddy's boy" Malfoy that is good. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/Exile][Exile]] is a fic about Malfoy after the war, given an option different than that any of the blood purist, old money Slytherins would ever contemplate. It's incomplete, but it just updated within the last week, and the previous update was right around Christmas, and it seems like it updates a couple times every year.
