Now after a little research I couldn't find what I wanted. Usually FEM! harry is in more front I am not interested that kind of stories therefore and Harry isn't a girl I'm looking for a story simple and that takes place in the world of Percy Jackson thanks for helping.

But there aren't very many good Percy Jackson fics, so it's pretty much just the same few getting recommended every time.)
