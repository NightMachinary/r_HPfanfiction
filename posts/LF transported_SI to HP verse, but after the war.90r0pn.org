So basically guy goes to Hogwarts but only shortly after the war, so no new generation. He/she really just enjoys it, has no real adversary, just is thrilled to have magic and wants to become a new Dumbledore or whatever. Pls no psychoanalysis on how you lose all loved people or whatever. Can be very fluffy, but no romance as main focus


** I'd like to see something like this too. Really, just any fluffy fic just exploring going through the years at Hogwarts would be fine with me.
