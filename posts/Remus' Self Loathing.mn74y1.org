Just an idea I had. I get being a monster sucks, and having society backing that prerogative surely doesn't help, but Remus is in a rut deeper than I think it should be. Solution? Simple! Make his life suck even more by giving him a reason to hate himself.

Remus had a sister, Geminus Lupin. (Remus may have meant twin at one point, a latin translation for twin is Geminus.) Any guess as to how close they were? Yup, twins.

Well, guess who Remus mauls to death. /manic author laughter/


** /YOU MONSTER !/

But yes, good idea.

** If you want him to have a twin, Romulus is the natural choice for a name.

** Adding a female character just to kill them to add angst to a male characters back story is such a cliche.

I like the idea of Romulus being the twin and something different happening so he shows back up. A. He is sent to live with relatives to protect him from Remus. B. He gets abducted by the wolf pack and becomes Fenrir's lieutenant. C. He joins a group of monster hunters.

Sure, Remus won't be extra self loathing, but you could just make Hope Lyall emotionally abusive.
