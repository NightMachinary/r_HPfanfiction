San Diego State Library researchers want to hear from you! Do you read or consume fanfiction? Do you create it? Do you have opinions about fanfiction platforms and how fanfiction is tagged? Take our survey!

User survey: [[https://bit.ly/3lkMzJZ]]

Creator Survey: [[https://bit.ly/3gyIsWU]]

Apologies for cross-posting - we are trying to get as broad a spectrum of respondents as we can.

*** In testing on a laptop and my phone I was able to deselect an option by tapping on it again, which grayed it out, and then when I chose a different option the grayed out option cleared. So you can deselect only by selecting it a second time then making a new selection.

***** Boo! I'm sorry about that. It probably doesn't work because there is no other option to switch to. That is a quirk of Qualtrics, a powerful yet amazingly frustrating piece of software to work with. If you want to privately message me the option you wanted to have, I can make a note to adjust the final data counts for that question.

******* You are right, if we had a second option like N/A it would allow deselection. We are Qualtrics newbies, and hindsight is doing it thing. There are questions we should have asked but didn't think of until now, and question options and formatting that we would add and change, but now that the survey is live we are stuck with what it is. *sigh*

*** For anyone and everyone who reads or creates fanfiction! Myself and my colleague work at San Diego State University, so that's why the informed consent page has the SDSU logo, but the survey is intended for everyone 14 years old and up.
