All of us know of the popular pairing Harry/Hermione that is possibly the most common pairing in this fandom after Dramione or Drarry. I want to see a fanfic where Harry rejects hermione's friendship or rejects her declaration of love.

‚Äã

*Bonus points if not friends and over 80k*

Thank you,

PS: I have read the infamous 'A Cadmean Victory'


** I gotta admit, I am a bit of a sucker for when Harry actually rejects and friend-zones a girl.

I've seen elements in a few, scattered stories where Susan, Hannah ,or another character tries to flirt with him and ask him out in his Fifth, Sixth, or even late Fourth years. However, although he had forgiven them, he hadn't forgotten what they did thus turning them down flat, much to their surprise.

**** I honestly can't remember where they are on FFn, but I think they may be under the Harry Potter/Susan Bones character filters somewhere?

Someone else might be able to identify these stories and give titles for them:

- Susan gets injured during apparition lessons: Harry takes her to the Hospital Wing for splinching. She tries to flirt with him, he's uncomfortable. Eventually, she goes for the direct approach after being in his arms, and he turns her down flat\\
  She's stunned, hurt and confused as to why, and he just gives a vague answer about Fourth Year.\\
  IIRC Hannah goes overprotective mode, actually attacks Harry, gets hurt in some awful Harry Potter Indie Cliches, and it eventually causes Susan to side with Harry over Hannah's bitchery and causes Hannah's parents to tell Susan to keep away from their daughter.
- Harry starts dating a normal, non-Ice Queen Daphne Greengrass in his Fifth or Sixth year. She's a likable person, and despite Ron's misgivings, he actually warms up to her (albeit is still suspicious). She's broadly accepted by them.\\
  Hermione, in the meantime, has developed feelings for Harry is actively jealous: Harry is completely unaware but it's obvious from the narrative it's completely unrequited love on her end.\\
  There was a meeting in the Library where Hermione gets crushed when Harry reveals he wants to ask out Daphne (hence his hanging around there), not for wanting to study with her, and another where they all meet in the Three Broomsticks: Ron is dragged off by Lavender, Cho tries to capture Harry's eye again and fails, and Hermione stews in bitter jealousy as Daphne is welcomed in.

*** The tropes in this are sickeningly bad. It's a shitty Indie Harry story.

However, one part...

"No! Fuck off! It's still mine!" the dragon roared before [...]

That little subversion made me openly laugh.

**** Worse, it's a shitty Dark! Indie! Harry story. Which means Harry gets to act like a complete asshole and we're supposed to love him for it.

Got as far as chapter 3 before I had to quit. I mean yeah not allowing people to push you around is applaudable but behaving like Draco and Dudley's obnoxious love child is where I draw the line.

Harry be like "get to work bitch" as he unzips his jeans.

Did a 13 year old kid at the start of puberty write this or something?

******* He starts groping Rita Skeeter in a room or something and it implies he's about to do force her. Something like that, it's been a while.

I honestly just noped out at that point.

Sad, as needing in editing as the author is and as loving the edge as they are, sometimes his fics can be funny, but no way was I reading that.

******** He made her give him a blowjob and sing an abusive contract to never say anything bad about him and shit like that if I'm not mistaken.

So yeah, he's a rapist. The contract part I'm not entirely sure, I can be confusing this fic with another indy!Harry shitty one were I think he tortures her.

I read it because I wanted a good laugh but that part was just gross.
