!linkffn(The Advantages of Being Sane)

tLoD's /The Bond of the Veela/

!linkffn(The Bond of the Veela)

*** Nice suggestions!

I read through Chaos Theory and it's an above-average For Want of A Nail fic. It actually has a single, small point of divergence, but follows through on sweeping consequences instead of still railroading to canon events. I like the switching of character perspectives a lot - the author does a good job of making the characters think and speak in distinct voices. The prose is serviceable, but not on the level of the best fics in the fandom, imo. Overall though, definitely a recommend.

I'm less interested in The Advantages of Being Sane. I read through the first five chapters or so and it's well-written and relatively consistent, but the overall premise is hard for me to believe and I'm really squicked out by any fic that pairs a resurrected Voldemort (i.e. 65 year old Voldemort) with school-age Harry. Probably just not my cup of tea, but if you enjoyed Limpeiza de Sangre, you'll probably like this? (Never read that one either :) Also, props to the author for a, frankly, ridiculous writing rate - they've churned through 30,000 words in under a month and it doesn't feel rushed or shoddy.

The Bond of the Veela just doesn't sound up my alley, so I can't comment on it at all.

Thanks for the recommendations!

**** In defence of Limpeiza de Sangre, I wouldn't say that it pairs the two honestly. There's hints that Harry is infatuated by fem!voldemort, but I don't think it's wrong to say that their relationship isn't really written as a romance, despite wheat some people reading the fic were hoping for.

***** Harry definitely has a crush on Emily. Emily does not return those feelings but it smart enough to play off them from time to time.

Buuut there is something I'm working on in 2019 that....sort of /vomits/ pairs them.

***** Yeah, Power is Control is the only fic besides tAoBS that pairs Harry with fem!Voldemort, at least of the ones I've read (It even uses the name Emily for Voldemort). Thunderstorm and Descent both do fem!Riddle, which isn't quite the same.

**** I have to say, I didn't think Chaos Theory was very good. There has to be other For Want of a Nail fics that are higher quality, right?

I think the backstory for Bryce was unnecessarily melodramatic. /Of course/ his father was a soldier who died a heroic death, /of course/ Frank was a loner until he met a beautiful girl in a contrived way, and then PS they loved to dance. /Of course/ the love of his life dies tragically as well. I'm not really sure why the Frank Bryce backstory was necessary for the fic to do what it needed to do. I guess you can say they were just fleshing out a character for character's sake, but the backstory was so cheesy I didn't think it was worth it.

Then we move to Amelia Bones' visit to Harry. I don't understand the portrayal of Vernon as so stupid that he would think beating his nephew in from of other adults would ever be a good idea. And then of course you have Amelia discover the cupboard under the stairs and she gets righteously angry at Vernon. That trope is so worn out at this point.

The premise of the Ministry catching Voldemort in his weakened state is cool, and having Frank Bryce run to the cops rather than investigate is a smart enough point of divergence, but already through two chapters there was way too much cheesy tropes for me.

  When Harry and Cedric grab the Cup, they are transported to a graveyard, where Harry witnesses the resurrection of Lady Voldemort... who isn't quite what he'd expected. For one, she isn't trying to kill him. For another, she doesn't seem to like the Death Eaters either. Harry/fem!Voldemort.

  In a dynamic system, two points, no matter how close they are to one another, will eventually be very far apart as long as there is a small difference between them. So when the Riddle's gardener decides to take action, how will that small change have a large impact on our favorite hero and the greater wizarding world? Rated T.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18456680]])

The complex relationship between the Black brothers, and the very creepy setting of #12 Grimmauld Place. Walburga and Orion didn't exactly childproof their home like parents should.
