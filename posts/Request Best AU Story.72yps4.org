Looking for well written and interesting AU stories, can be as close to canon while being AU or as far as canon or anywhere in between.

I love AU's, there's so much you can do with an AU.

Note I know that there are a lot of cliches, time travel, Wrong Boy/Girl Who Lived, Neville is Boy Who Lived, Harry is sorted into Slytherin, Creature Inheritance Harry ect extra and while those cliches are fine if any story has those cliches I want something different done with those cliches.

I'd rather the AU be more different/unique then most Harry Potter stories, something different and refreshing.

No Weasley or Dumbledore bashing unless it makes sense for that universe, if it's just the author doing it to do it, I don't want it in the story.

Any rating is fine, am fine with Het/Slassh/Femslash.

Any Era, any character can be the main character not just Harry.

Would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

No Crossovers.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/Reign-of-the-Serpent]["Reign of the Serpent."]] EXTREMELY AU,Salazar Slytherin rules the wizarding world as its immortal High Lord, wizards are divided into castes based on the old Hogwarts houses (with the Serpent caste being on top, of course), Tom Riddle is Headmaster of Hogwarts, Dumbledore is an outlaw and revolutionary, and the wizards are at constant war with Dark creatures. Hermione's the main character, but you get, Harry, Ron, Neville, and even Dean Thomas and Justin Finch-Fletchley, in large roles as well.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/series/241642]["Weasley Girl"]] is an AU that's closer to canon; the only initial difference is that Ron is a girl with a strange affinity for animals. It's a planned trilogy; the second story in the trilogy is almost finished.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

*** Reign of the serpent has been INCREDIBLE. I just read it but I'm so sad it was never finished!!!! :((( The world building was amazing and fully immersive. All the characters are so two dimensional and the conflicts are real. Man, I hate when good fic dies.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome) is criminally underrated. Creates a world where wizards/country number in the millions instead of the hundred thousands. It creates a distinct culture and heritage and Harry comes into the world with his own level of notoriety.

The best part has to be that the plot so far doesn't deal with Voldemort (pretty sure he doesn't exist here), and creates a far more interesting Harry. This Harry is more curious than canon!Harry and has time to explore magic and the castle as he's not fighting for survival every single year. Seriously, read this.

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way.

** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm]["Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived"]]. AU without magic, where "Harworts" is a school for spies - James Bond style. Goes through all seven years and is complete. I wouldn't have thought I'd ever like Harry Potter without magic, but this story is great. Good foreshadowing of the romance between Ron and Hermione as well. It follows the canon plot, but with enough deviations to keep it interesting, and the characters' actions don't suffer from the "adults are useless" trope in canon.
