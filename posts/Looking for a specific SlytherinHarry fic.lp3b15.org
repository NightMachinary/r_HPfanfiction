:END:
He gets sorted into slytherin from the first year and encounters slytherin politics where there's a king (the 7th year) and queen. A slytherin king named Nero actually ends up being on friendly terms with harry and his queen is named Diana. They basically look out for him. Harry still has to face voldemort etc etc, at some point later down the plot he visits Nero and Diana, and he becomes the godfather of their child.
