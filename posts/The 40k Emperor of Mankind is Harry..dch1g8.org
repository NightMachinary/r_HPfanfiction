** I think it doesn't affect HP very much at all. The Emperor was slow to develop his full majesty and I think at the end of his time at Hogwarts, Harry will only just be starting to get an inkling of his past lives. I would expect Harry to be much taller and more buff than in canon, but not to the extent that it significantly affects the story.

The real question, is how does this affect 40k? Given Harry's tendency to make friends with just about anything sentient, I think it would make the Imperium much less xenophobic. The Emporer would probably also spend more time actually teaching psykers how to psyk. The end result is probably the Ruinous Powers having less of an advantage of surprise and the Horus Heresy either failing or never coming to pass in the first place. Perhaps, the galaxy would be a little less GrimDark.
