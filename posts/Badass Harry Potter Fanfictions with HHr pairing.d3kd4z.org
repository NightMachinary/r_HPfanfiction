  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** Most stories by robst, his Harry doesn't take shit from anyone, and they're always HHr.

*** And they're so, so, so bad. Robst is not someone who understands how a story flows, or understands how characters work. Like WTF is with his hate boner for Dumbledore? Don't get me wrong, i'm not a big fan of Dumbledore, I think he made stupid choices, and was maybe a little too manipulative, but he was human. He was in general the oldest human in the room, and a war hero who had dealt with previous dark lords. I'd believe I know best in his shoes too. While Harry got royally screwed by Dumbledore's decisions, his decisions did in the end save both Harry's life, and the lives of the british wizarding population.

Dumbledore was not someone who believed Harry should suffer, and he would not pay Ron to be his friend. Basically if you like good Harry Potter stories, don't read robst. If you'd enjoy stories where the character is one dimensional, never wrong, and some badass magical prodigy, read robst.

**** So much hate on robst lol. You're entitled to your opinion but lemme point out that OP asked for badass Harry. Badass Harry, not badass Hermione and her little bitch Harry like in Starfox's fic recced above. Whatever you say about robst his Harry isn't anybody's bitch.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
