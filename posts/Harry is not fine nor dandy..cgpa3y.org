Im looking for a story that has a happy Harry but everyone thinks he's depressed when he really isn't.

Crack preferred.


** But what if he was [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxLSAGAFPLI][fine and dandy?]]

It's not really related to what you wanted, but your wording made me think of the music video "Fine & Dandy" for the Confinement series of short SCP animations. Basically, I was thinking of a Harry who instantly revives after death, now whole and healthy but standing right next to his own corpse.

**** I know there's a time-loop-on-death Harry that has an exceptionally competent Voldemort to fight. I'll see if I can dig up the name; it's the closest thing I've seen to this.

  Umbridge's unorthodox field trip to Jusenkyo might have proven why her Defense curriculum was efficacious, if she hadn't accidentally cursed herself, Snape, half of Hogwarts's student body, two Death Eaters, and one hapless Dark Lord. OotP AU
