** I recognize your description, but I don't recall title or author or anything useful... maybe the search will keep running in the background and I'll edit this post if I remember it :)

** I remember reading this and it was quite enjoyable to read. I had a look but couldn't find it from a quick search. If I get chance I'll check my ffn follows later and see if it's in there.
