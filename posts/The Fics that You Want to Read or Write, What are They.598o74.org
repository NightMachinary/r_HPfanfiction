In other words, which stories do you readers wish existed?

Or, for the writers, what are the fic ideas that you have sitting around gathering dust?


** I'm unlikely to ever write any of these, so I'd be interested to see a good author adopt any of these premises.

*The Order of the Basilisk:* Grindelwald beat Dumbledore in 1945 and now rules Muggles and Magicials alike in a subjugated Europe, the Elder Wand making him nearly invincible. Rumors whisper of a secret vigilante group that resist the Dark Lord by night and day: the Order of the Basilisk, let by the mysterious Voldemort. Only Voldemort is just the mask worn by current Hogwarts Headmaster, Tom Riddle. Still, things have been looking dire, until Voldemort comes across a Prophecy promising of one destined to defeat the Dark Lord... Tom Riddle centric, Mentor!Voldemort.

Tom isn't a good guy, more of an anti-villain. Rather focusing his energies towards dominating Wizarding Britain, he's been taking care of Hogwarts and resisting Grindelwald's rule, so those same qualities that made him such a terrifying Dark Lord in canon are being used for good to an extent here. (Though it's enlightened self-interest on his part)

Outwardly, he's a Dumbledorian figure. He's not torture-happy or the like here (he prefers the soft sell here) but he's still a lot Darker than most people would like. Still, he's the best chance at defeating Grindewald, at least until Harry came along.

James and Lily are alive and well and committed "Death Eaters" in the resistance against Grindelwald, with the Death Eaters in general either terrorists or revolutionaries, depending on your perspective. Tom's still got a couple of Horcruxes here (the Diary and the Stone) and has settled for a three-part soul.

The story would largely alternate between Riddle's tenure at Hogwarts, his interactions with Grindelwald's oppressive administration, his work in the Order and the encounters he has with both Order members and Grindelwald, and his mentoring of Harry. While Voldemort can't quite beat Grindelwald in a duel, he has the seeming ability to survive what should be mortal injuries, even shrugging off Killing Curses and the like. (This is, of course, due to Voldemort's Horcruxes tethering him to life)

Harry in turn, under Voldemort's tutelage from a young age, develops into a very skilled and potent wizard. Towards his seventeenth year, he and Voldemort fight alongside each other, and the two brother wands being used together allows them to achieve an effect almost matching that of the Elder Wand.

Voldemort would ultimately be turned mortal, only managing to keep ahold of the Stone, though the soul fragment is destroyed by Fiendfyre. Grindelwald would later find and destroy the Diary, once he figured out the secret behind Voldemort's longevity. (Grindelwald, at least, finds the idea of mutilating your soul to be an utterly insane idea. Hallows, not Horcruxes)

At the end, Voldemort and Harry have one last climactic duel against Grindewald when his forces invade Hogwarts. Finally coming to peace with his mortality after the loss of his Horcruxes (the Stone partly helps here), Voldemort ends up sacrificing himself in a move that allows Harry to make the winning attack, letting Harry to gain the Elder Wand and become Master of Death, before Harry finishes off Grindelwald.

Close with Harry's reflection on the mixed legacy of his grandfather figure, someone who was vital to overthrowing Grindelwald, but who committed more than his share of atrocities along the way.

*By Ministerial Decree:* In the immediate wake of Voldemort's defeat in DH, Kingsley isn't made emergency Minister For Magic---/Harry/ is. With the chaos following the Dark Lord's fall, Kingsley convinces Harry that he'd be the best man for the job, as a rallying point and as a symbol for hope and change. However, with the infrastructure of the Ministry of Magic in shambles, a virtually non-existent Wizengamot, and so forth, Harry pretty much just /is/ the government of Wizarding Britain at this point. The Order intends to use Harry more as a figurehead given his inexperience, but Harry's a pretty willful guy and intends to actually be the Minister For Magic, not just in name only.

Basically, this should be a fast-moving political thriller, with emphasis on Harry really being pushed to his limits dealing with several problems at once. He'll have to govern Wizarding Britain largely on his own, while dealing with political pressures from multiple sides, given his temperament and inexperience. There are a lot of problems left over even with Voldemort dead, between Death Eaters on the run, the government in shambles, and politicians challenging his current administration. Him and the Order would clash heads at times, since Harry is not content to just be a figurehead Minister For Magic, the way Thicknesse and arguably Fudge were.

The story would conclude about a year later, with Harry lifting martial law once a semblance of order has come back to Wizarding Britain, and active elections on the Wizengamot are being held, with Harry having successfully navigated through multiple crises, most particularly with the Death Eater situation. Close with Harry's intention to run for the Minister For Magic legitimately.

The title's a play on Tom Clancy's /Executive Orders,/ the main inspiration for this idea. I don't trust my ability to write politics in detail, so I'd love to see this premise picked up by a good author.

*The Mudblood Queen:* Slytherin!Hermione story, since we all know how driven Hermione is. (She /did/ become the Minister For Magic after all in /Cursed Child/) /Applied Cultural Anthropology/ is likely considered the archetypal Slytherin!Hermione, and it's an excellent story and all, but the angle I was considering was going to be quite different.

The story would begin properly in 5th year, not first year on as ACA did. Furthermore, Hermione would not be friends with Harry and his group here, having not at all participated in his adventures with the Philosopher's Stone, Slytherin's Heir, the Dark Lord's Servant, or the Triwizard Tournament. Hermione's her own person in this story, having grown herself, independently of Harry's adventures. Also, Snape never bothers trying to mentor Hermione. That's not really his thing. In addition, I don't really find any kind of politicking or the like plausible for 11 or 12 year olds, so a 5th year story sets a nice spot for such interactions to happen.

The starting point to this story would have Harry and his friends approaching Hermione to recruit her for the burgeoning DA, knowing her reputation as the brightest witch in their year---as well as that she isn't your typical Slytherin. It would continue on as an alt-5th year story, with Hermione juggling handling the Slytherins, her studies and her own independent Dark Arts work, the DA, and her relationship with Krum. For her own personal narrative, Hermione would take increasing amounts of power within Slytherin House, effectively establishing her own power bloc, and already recruiting some of her first followers in Slytherin... (Shades of Tom Riddle, anyone?)

Close the story and Hermione's arc at the end of the year with the establishment of her first circle of Death Eater analogues.

/Some quick notes/: This isn't a Super!Hermione story or an Evil!Hermione story. She's willing to do nasty things to get things done, but isn't actively evil. Also, Harry is still largely the better duelist and better at spells like the Patronus Charm. Hermione's in character here, just less restrained and a bit more self-driven. Thematically, you'd go for strong Snape and Tom Riddle parallels for Hermione, though she's ultimately her own person at the end of the day.

/Some backstory/: in her first year, she was nearly killed during the Troll attack on Halloween---Parkinson and Malfoy's bullying that day got to her---and quickly learned that she'd need to fend for herself in Slytherin House. Second year, she missed out on a significant portion of due to being petrified by the Basilisk. It was really in her third and fourth year that she'd come into an entity in her own right, devouring as much advanced magic as she could, and delving into the Dark Arts whenever possible.

By her fourth year, Hermione would have firmly established herself as a potent independent figure in Slytherin House, with lots of nasty things happening to her bullies and others that tried to cross her---think what she did to Edgecombe in OotP, but worse. She's come to be known as "The Mudblood of Slytherin," though it's a less of an insult here than a title to be wary of. None of this behavior reaches the Professors, who believe that Hermione's a model student. Only Snape actively mistrusts her.

While few in Slytherin actively associate with her---Daphne Greengrass tolerates her and she's sort of friends with Tracey Davis---she's managed to generate enough fear by this point that people leave her alone. She'd have also established further reputation by entering into a relationship with Viktor Krum as the Triwizard Tournament progressed, with the two of them both planning on continuing the relationship even as a long-distance one. It also helps that Krum's helped her out with her studies in the Dark Arts throughout the year, as well as sending over some Dark Arts texts for her to peruse after he leaves Hogwarts.

At the same time, Harry and his group have been having their own independent adventures. In first year, Harry managed to figure out Snape's puzzle, stumbling through it similar to how he managed to solve the Sphinx's riddle in GoF. In second year, it was outside-the-box thinking from Luna that allowed Harry and Ron to rescue Ginny. In third year, unfortunately without the Time Turner, Buckbeak was killed. While Harry was able to produce a Patronus to drive off the Dementors, he was unable to save Sirius, who was Kissed. Fourth year proceeded similar to canon by and large.

The title is obviously a play on "The Halfblood Prince" and again, I'd love to see an author who can competently handle politics write this story.

*** Some other assorted ideas I've got, not quite as developed as the three above:

*As We Would Have Done For You:* Back in the heyday of HP fanfiction, everyone was writing Betrayed!Harry stories, with him ending up in Azkaban. Why not use the canonical character that /was/ actually wrongly abandoned by his friends and allies, Sirius Black? 3rd year divergence where Sirius never sees the paper in 3rd year, remaining stuck in Azkaban until Voldemort's breakout in 5th year lets him sneak out. Sirius's innocence is known to the Order right now, but Sirius has no interest in seeing his old allies and friends, who he left abandoned him when he needed them. Should mostly focus on Sirius making his own path independent of the Order and the Ministry, doing his own thing to help out Harry--who he regards as the sole innocent here--and do something about the Death Eaters.

I could see Sirius going a bit Darker here, holing up in 12 Grimmauld Place and with only the occasional contact with Harry--and Remus's constant inquiries--to break up the boredom. He'd peruse the Black Library and since he's already Public Enemy #1, he uses his reputation to allow him to do things the Order would never sanction, striking back at the Death Eaters still walking around...

*Hogwarts Mystery Inc:* /Scooby Doo/ / /Harry Potter./ 3rd year divergence. Hermione puts together a mystery-solving group at Hogwarts, with Harry, Ron, and oddly enough, Daphne Greengrass at her side. Hermione's the brains, Daphne's got the looks, Harry handles the fights, and Ron's the man with the dog at his side. Basically, Harry = Fred, Hermione = Velma, Ron = Shaggy, Daphne = Daphne, and Snuffles = Scooby Doo. Should proceed on a "case-file" format, with the group taking on different mysteries, before culminating in the Mystery of Sirius Black at the end of the year.

*Searching for Ron Weasley:* Hermione convinces Ron that his talent for Chess is a lot more useful than he thinks. Ron goes into professional chess post-Hogwarts. Story would simultaneously cover Ron's meteoric rise to becoming a Chess grandmaster, as well as Ron and Hermione's developing relationship, culminating in Ron proposing marriage to Hermione after winning the World Chess Championship in 2004. Title's obviously from /Searching For Bobby Fischer/; I'm pants at chess, so someone familiar with the ins and outs of chess as well as competent at writing should pen this.

*A Fistful of Galleons:* Adapt the /Dollars/ trilogy with similar characters and set in the 1800s, except they use wands, not guns. Could either use a cast of OCs, lift the characters wholesale from the /Dollars/ trilogy, or use HP characters anachronistically, but re-imagined into /Dollars/ characters. Sequels would be /A Few Galleons More,/ and /The Good, the Bad, and Umbridge./

*Reign of Fiendfyre:* AU. Harry defeats Voldemort, but on Voldemort's defeat, Voldemort had let loose something that's long been caged deep beneath the earth: true Dragons. After twenty years, humanity is an endangered species hostage to the Dragons. Both Harry Potter and Charlie Weasley command one of the last remaining human settlements in Scotland, the Statue of Secrecy long since broken...

Title and plot setup is from the /Reign of Fire/ film.

** One I don't want to write, but would like to read is where something happens to Petunia and Vernon, and Lily and James take in Dudley. There's a good fic (can't remember the title) that explores it as a one-shot when Dudley is upset he can't go to Hogwarts with Harry and Lily comforts him. I'd like a long one though.

One I'd like to read, and have played around with writing, is where Lily ends up with Snape and they have a son named Harry. But when something happens to them (could be Voldemort, like canon, though preferably not), that Harry is raised by Petunia and Vernon. His mentor at Hogwarts ends up being James. I believe James would end up being a good mentor for him, as a foil to what Snape was to Harry in canon.

I'm also writing a Mrs. Figg/Moody fic for some inexplicable reason. Came to me one day when I was rereading OotP. Might post it eventually. She's reminiscing about their relationship a few days before the Seven Potters scene, and waiting for Moody to come for her after the mission (they're moving into a safe house together, since her mission for Dumbledore is finally done).

** An idea that is currently gathering dust: Harry in Durnstrang.

AU in two points of divergence.\\
One: Lily had an aunt that married a Norwegian wizard (aunt is a Squib). Dumbledore, facing the choice of Petunia and Vernon or Johan and Iris (names not final), chooses the latter.

Two: Karkaroff doesn't provide any new intel to Crouch during his trial, and is sentenced to life in Azkaban. By the time Harry is eleven, Karkaroff is dead. The Headmaster of Durmstrang (which in this story is in Svalbard) is therefore not Karkaroff, but a Norwegian wizard. Given that Hogwarts letters are not automatically sent to those not on British soil (something canon is vague about), Harry goes to Durmstrang instead.

Story start: fifth year, after the Triwizard (that Harry didn't get to attend, being fourth year when it took place at Hogwarts).

Main plot:\\
Norway is a country much like the magical USA: as long as you have magic (or are a Squib), you're welcome. However, Norwegian society has its own issues. Specifically, there are three factions at large.\\
1) the Pagans. Key characteristic: adherence to the old ways (meaning the pantheon of Norse mythology, with all the (blood) ritual and other ritual sacrifice that comes with it).\\
2) the Christians. Ritual sacrifice is a no-go, but other rituals are welcomed and even encouraged, 'to bring you closer to unity with God'.\\
3) the Modernists (or, in keeping with the religious themes of the other two factions, the Atheists or the Agnostics, though I prefer Modernists). All rituals are /not done/, barbaric throwbacks to times long gone that has no place in modern society.

These factions are intended as a mirror of the religious history of Norway. All three factions have all three heritage types (pure, half, muggle), though most purebloods are Pagan.

Harry was raised a Pagan.

The story would revolve around the conflict between these three factions, how the tensions have been increasing for years and years, and how those are on the point of boiling over into full-blown civil war. Harry is thrust to the forefront as the most talented Pagan wizard of his generation, and he will eventually lead the Pagan side, hopefully to victory.

Along the way, he'll learn that the Modernists aren't that bad, and there's quite a few Christians he can stomach. They're just on the opposite side of the fields of battle, whether magical or political.

Voldemort would be a non-entity in this story, as it's quite involved enough without him.

#+end_quote

The Christians here should probably be traditional Lutherans, actually. So, they wouldn't have rituals and such, like the Pagans might, but they would have a Liturgy of the Hours, celebrate the Eucharist on Sunday, and so on.

They could also, perhaps, be Catholic, depending on exactly how the Statute of Secrecy and the Reformation line up.

One thing they should not be, though, is a sort of non-denominational/Baptist Christians, unless there's a very good reason for it.

**** The Pagans would be partially restorationists, mostly just survivors of the Christianization and looking to get out on top. Whether that ends in Christian/Modernist exile or not (edit: not being defined as co-existence), they don't care (though to the restorationalists only an exile or outright purge is acceptable).

As for the Christians... you're thinking too Muggle. The early Norwegian Christians were Pagans (both in and out of this story) and, while the Muggle Pagans were content to let the Pagan rituals they observed be replaced with the Christian rituals (because the Eucharist and the Liturgy are just rituals in another form, really), the wizarding Pagans weren't.

Might have had something to do with the fact that their rituals actually had a /tangible/ effect on the world, even if it wasn't for the reason they thought it was. Naturally, ritual magic would be heavily explored (which is why Harry is raised as Pagan and not one of the other two).

The converted Pagans adapted their rituals to fit with the new constraints. Later generations, raised Christian, simply mimicked them without thinking too much on why things were the way they were.

And then came Luther. I'll admit that I initially thought that the Reformation happened in /17/17, rather than 1517, so I haven't given too much thought to it.

If I were to seriously write this story rather than let it collect dust, I'd definitely have to do a second and third pass over my notes and research. Unfortunately, I don't have time.

** I like to read stories with a strong Hermione (and preferably without her falling for Draco).

With regards to stories I want to write, there are a few I'm planning to write.

R.E.D. - Returned, Extremely Dangerous

Grindelwald, who has changed in prison and came to terms with his punishment, hears about Albus's death, and decides that he owes it to his only friend and true love to finish Albus's task and save Britain from Voldemort (no matter if it wants to be saved, or not). He escapes from Nuremgard and gathers his remaining loyal followers on the way to Britain, unaware of just how much panic his escape caused in the rest of Europe. Harry, Hermione and Ron have to deal with a well-meaning, but not quite sane Dark Lord and his equally warped followers. Hitting the Dark Humour tone will be a challenge, though.

Hermione Granger, Master Thief

Hermione gets expelled from Hogwarts after a plot by the Malfoys leaves her framed as a thief. Since her Family is also financially ruined, she decides to pay the Malfoys and everyone else back by becoming the best thief ever and rob them blind. Dumbledore, feeling guilty for not having been able to prevent her expulsion, hooks her up with an old friend of his, an accomplished thief and conman (Alternate Fletcher, with more style). Of course, Albus also thinks a skilled thief would come in Handy once Voldemort returns. The story would have her Training, her involvement in the ar, and her post-Hogwarts career, playing cat and mouse with Head Auror Harry Potter.

** I've seen tons of 'dark' Harry or Hermione fics set during Hogwarts era, but I personally think they were far more likely to go dark after the War. Here is an idea/head canon I posted in [[/r/HarryPotter]] already:

Just by using postwar information from Pottermore, CC (selectively), and JKR herself, I can derive a much much darker interpretation of what they had become 20 years later (The DA could become the acronym for 'Dark Army').

Their generation should be completely fed up by the failures of their predecessors, and wanted to do things THEIR WAY. Core DA members had to come to an understanding after the War that things in Magical Britain were no longer sustainable and revolutionary changes had to take place. This mindset provided the ideological underpinning of their movements, which centered around Hermione and Harry.

I don't think they would just become your average corrupt politicians, but ruthless revolutionaries who displayed an almost perfect public image (model families, modest living). They ran on great sounding platforms (equality, justice, love, peace, and prosperity), had hordes of hardcore followers (DA, Quidditch fans, Hogwarts graduates, werewolves, fanboys/girls), turned the military/police (the DMLE) into their private army, became filthy rich (confiscated Death Eater wealth, memory charmed Muggles, Weasley owned businesses, royalties from their 'heroic deeds'), dominated the public media (Ginny was the real force behind The Daily Prophet, Luna owned the next largest publication), were utterly ruthless to their enemies (real and perceived), and most importantly, firmly believed what they were doing was right and necessary to protect their 'loved ones'.

Threats to their power base would have unfortunate accidents or die in embarrassing ways (what? he had a heart attack while engaging in autoerotic asphyxiation? oh dear...), or even accidentally blow themselves up while attempting dark rituals. People who opposed them politically would have their positions undercut through media and rumors. Some PIA would be taken care of by street violence, such as an angry mob demanding the head of that 'Slanderous Rita'. Meanwhile, Hermione would be the calm, thoughtful, considerate leader who seemed really nice, while Harry would be the brave, energetic, and powerful hero who kept everyone safe.

I can very well imagine the following conversation: "Yes, it really is necessary, and I prepared this 400 page document that makes it all clear, so you go read it and come back if there's anything you don't understand, and we'll have a lovely talk about it." (person leaves) "Harry, I want that arse investigated so hard it scours his floors. Find something, and if you can't find something, make something up. Perhaps plant some naughty ideas in his head first."

These people would eat Frank Underwood for breakfast.

*** While I think this would be a very cool idea and merits further exploration, I find it hard to believe this would ever be a plausible interpretation of canon, purely because I can't see Harry being fine with that sort of endemic corruption. Hermione I can see doing something this ruthless, especially if she firmly believed what she was doing was right, and Ron might if the other two are for it, but Harry? The bloke has a deep, ingrained distrust of power, and even greater distrust of the people who abuse whatever scraps of power they have. Canon never paints him as anything but a born iconoclast who despises corruption, regardless of where it comes from: if Hermione were to abuse her power in such a way, Harry wouldn't join her; he'd probably be the first to try and bring her to justice. For him to suddenly turn around and become as decadent as the people he hates, even if he believes he's doing it for the right reasons, seems wildly out of character for me.

**** It has definite potential. Fall from grace stories are some of my favorites to read. Given the right motivations, anyone can grow used to and participate in terrible things. Even when those motivations are "good" ones.

As far as Harry goes, I could see him gradually slipping due to a "become like them to defeat them" attitude. Pragmatism gone wrong, that sort of thing. Basically, Harry and friends would pull an /Animal Farm/ on magical Britain:

**** My interpretation of Harry's character was far less benign than yours. By the end of DH, he was ready to crucio his enemies without a shred of remorse. In CC, he behaved very vindictively.

I imagine that after the War, traumatized people of Wizard Britain demanded massive changes and reforms in the Ministry. One of its major short coming during both wars was the lack of effectiveness of its police/military force. JKR herself mentioned "revolutionary changes" in the DMLE. That could mean vast expansion of police powers and significant improvements in investigative techniques. I expect Veritaserums and Pensive viewing of memories to be universally applied in all criminal cases. Furthermore, Kingsley worked on the staff of Muggle prime minister and should be highly familiar with Muggle government organizations. He would now be in a position to create a magical equivalent of MI6/SIS.

Do you see the problem here? Harry might not even realize that he was being corrupted by power, because in order to pursue his enemies and protect his loved ones, he was bound to demand more and more power for his organization. Because he was really good at his job (youngest head auror ever), his organization would also receive more and more power. It was actually a long term slippery slope.

When Rita Skeeter attacked them again during the 2014 World Cup, I could very well imagine something like that happening: Ginny first hexed her into St Mungos, next an enraged mob (encouraged by them of course) would walk on the street demanding an end to the 'Slanderous Rita', Harry's aurors would arrest her for 'exhaustive' investigations, and they would uncover 'massive wrongdoings' at Daily Prophet going back decades. Luna's Quibbler would pile on and incite public further. Eventually, things would result in Rita going to Azkaban for prolonged period and Daily Prophet changing ownership.

**** I mentioned before I would selectively use CC for canon purposes. Here is an excerpt showing what kind of dick Harry could be:

/HARRY: Albus didn't like me before. He might not like me again. But he will be safe. With the greatest respect, Minerva -- you don't have children --/

/GINNY: Harry!/

/HARRY: -- you don't understand./

/PROFESSOR McGONAGALL (deeply hurt): I'd hope that a lifetime spent in the teaching profession would mean .../

/HARRY: This map will reveal to you where my son is at all times -- I expect you to use it. And if I hear you don't -- then I will come down on this school as hard as I can -- using the full force of the Ministry -- is that understood?/

--------------

As much as I dislike CC, I agree with its characterization of Harry. He was no saint to begin with, unlike many fans expected or wished him to be, and he had hell of a temper. He fiercely loved his family and would do ANYTHING to protect them, and he would abuse his Ministry power to achieve that.

***** I think CC is terrible writing from all sides, it has inconsistent characterisation out the wazoo, and that includes Harry. Everyone agrees CC's Harry is terribly written because CC's Harry is the diametric opposite to the Harry we see in canon and especially in the epilogue.

But, even still, we're talking about two completely different things: you can argue that Harry's family is his blind spot, but there's absolutely nothing to suggest any of the measures you've mentioned in your OP, have anything to do with protecting his family. The way he behaves in CC is due to something that directly pertains to Albus; harshly investigating someone for being leery of legislation Hermione proposes has /nothing/ to do with his family. All it is, is Harry being a jackbooted thug for her. And, no, before someone says Hermione is Harry's family, she's not in any danger, not like Harry believed Albus was.

** I'm currently working on this 10th century fic. Its with a fem!Harry. Harry decides to take over the life of Alrun Ragnasdottir, a daughter of a family of Norse that live around the Pever Well (You may guess what family that is). Alrun has originally died in Bagdad, where even the greatest healers of the time were helpless against her disease. Harry takes over and "Alrun" lives on and comes back to her family. In the course of this fic, Harry/Alrun will make the aquaintance of all 4 Founders in the heat of war. In the very first chapters Alruns father brings back her sister, Alfhild from a christian family. It ignites a war between an alliance of pagans Norse/Danes, the Brittons, the Celts and some other, smaller groups, and the christian Saxons as well as the Church as a whole, with consequences that will alter history in tremendous ways.

I love digging through history for this fic, even though 10th century England is a hard one to understand, especially for one who has not learned about it in detail during history lessons (I learned about 10th century Central Europe/The Holy Roman Empire/ Habsburg-Austria) If anyone is interested, you can find my working file [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zBAaNj5RWAp0-85l1c6VzyjAUDrU8rLbjE7GcvFhfGU/edit?usp=sharing][here]]. Comments are active for visitors and feedback & criticism encouraged.

What I'd like to read, just because I've never read it before, would be a Bellatrix/Sirius fic. The House of Black is obviously not afraid of interbreeding too much and I can see that relationship be the reason for Sirius to ditch the Blacks and for Bellatrix to fall in with the wrong sort. I have no idea how this fic would even start off. Would they talk in Azkaban and just decide that "We might as well". I don't know. Which is why I'd love to see it done. It obviously would have to be the most disfunctional and clusterfuck-y relationship ever. Bonus points for them raising Harry and giving him siblings by the name of Virgo and Taure.

Someone merges with Dumbledore (self insert lmao) or Harry. I've read one seemingly abandoned fic and it's fantastic really.

OR someone else merges with Voldemort. Particularly Dumbledore or older Voldemort merges with his younger self in the past?

Quirrel didn't go to Albania and remains as a muggle studies teacher in Hogwarts.

Sybil didn't make the prophesy near anyone who'd pass it along and Voldemort doesn't get distracted and try to kill infants, instead his relentless and ruthless revolution continues ravaging magical society and Dumbledore has to do something drastic. Maybe enlist Grindelwald in disguise as most believe him dead. They cooperate and make progress in ending the brutality through a set of compromises for the greater good and revolutionises the entire magical society. Or Dumbledore relies on the deathly hallows in defeating Voldemort or something else entirely.

Snape did not get sorted into Slytherin. His mum left the muggle and raised Snape independently and gets a job in hospitality and raises Severus with a magical background and is in touch with the less blood supremist obsessed wizards and witches. He got sorted into Ravenclaw instead.

** I wanna read a story where we discover that Regulus Black is actually the father of Dean Thomas. I was looking at a canon timeline and I believe it's technically possible if you get creative with how Dean's mum and Regulus met. It would have to be a short lived affair, maybe even a one night stand with her finding out stuff after the fact. Anyway, as it turns out Dean's facts about his father "running from the Death Eaters" is only partially true (Regulus was a D.E. but was murdered for attempting to thwart LV) but he doesn't find out about all this until after Deathly Hallows. I'd like to see how this complicates his relationship with Harry, since it's revealed that Dean is actually a Black (the last surviving one, right?) and how Grimmauld place allows him secret access to areas and magic because he's blood. Harry identifies so strongly with Sirius, but here is a friend of his who is recognized as "more legitimate" by both magic and (to an extent) society. And how does Dean feel realizing his father wasn't the hero that he was made out to be but has a more complicated past?

** After reading all the storys where Dumbledore binds Harry's Magic as a way to give Harry a power boost

Dumbledore performed a binding on Harry's Magic back when Harry was a young man, in a attempt to provide resistance training for Harry. Unfortunately a binding like that can only last so long, only to the 21st Birthday of the subject. When Albus died he never did undo the bindings, leaving the duty to Harry. So Harry must travel around the world collecting the McGuffins needed to undo his Magical Bindings and complete the ritual before he dies.

Hogwarts start at 16

Hogwarts starts at 16, Harry's temper worn down due to 16 years under the Dursley's, Hermione with additional years of being beat up by Bullies isn't the Insufferable Genius and more meek, infact much of Gryffindor would been changed due to the addional 5 years, Dean Thomas a Street Artist, Seamus Finnigan a Drunken Hustler, Lavender Brown the girl with "Slut" written on her door, Parvati Patal a girl who constantly tries to tell the future, Neville Longbottom the silent giant heir.

Another is a Crossover, Harry Potter/DxD

I find The fact that this section is bare on ff.net a shame... SHAME!... but I diagnosed why and it's because Harry to be competitive he needs to be super strong, not exactly Canon Harry. Soooo

1679 years thats how long since the end of the final battle Harry has lived on planet earth, traveling the blue marble countless times finding and creating magic, his name becoming part of history and legend. But finding himself alone and isolated Harry decides to leave his world, his universe behind to find a life that is furfilling. Harry lands in the Town of Kuoh 10 years before Canon back in the body of his 6 year old self, his body and magic that of a 6 year old with the mind of a 1700 year old Master Wizard. Adopted by a much older rich couple to be their heir, Harry James Potter-Shōmei seeks a connection to the magical world of his new world. Risa Gremory is willing to oblige

** I'd love to see POTDK, Circular Reasoning and Criminal Limit finished, right now.

As for my own ideas gathering dust, I began two fics that are for now just sitting there (I want to finish my WIP before I think about getting back to them): a horror-comedy AU wherein Hogwarts is murderous and students and staff don't think it's a big deal. Starring Harry as Only Sane Man who nonetheless grows accustomed to the madness in time. There are silly names and outlandish things like the Great Hall that eats people.

The other one, also on hiatus is a an AU beginning in first year where Grindelwald rules half of Europe and Riddle is a Professor at Hogwarts who leads a clandestine group of people who support his desire to eventually rule Britain. Basically, he's still Voldemort, but with much better PR. Harry would slowly be corrupted/indoctrinated by Riddle into his most loyal follower. Features freaky alternate-dimensional magic that Harry has an affinity for. Would aim for creeps and mysteries.

** I've been trying to think of a Dark Souls/HP crossover wherein the "Power He Knows Not" is Harry being the "Bearer of the Curse" where every person/thing he kills empowers him whether he likes it or not. It could go Harry going with the Faith spells for a light/grey route or the Hex/Soul spears spells for a Dark/grey route since he's going to be the start of the Dark-Flame cycle. Maybe changing the prophesy/augmenting it a bit to fit thr Dark Souls lore.

And then there's the Suikoden's 27 True runes/HP crossover, with Harry being the bearer of the Rune of Life and Death/Soul Eater wherein it manipulates the fates of the people around the bearer to die so it could "feast", or the Rune of Punishment wherein it slowly kills the bearer the more him/her uses it.

The 27 true runes could be pillars of magical/natural concepts. Considering that these runes rule their repsective concepts, the soul eater could be a replacement or augmentation of the Deathly Hollows, I/an author could play with the other 25 true runes so that Potter wouldn't be the only one with a WMD.

These two ideas/concepts have been stewing in my mind for the longest time but I don't know where to start, and the fact that real life is bothering me.

As a result the war ends earlier, many who would die - survive (almost everybody from old Order photo), and some other things happen. Fast forward to 1991 and many things differ from the HP-verse as we know it (some due to main plot divergence, some due to others, some due to my setting changes). Harry is great friends with Susan and Neville, Frank Longbottom is Minister of Magic and future seems to be bright. And you know how it ends up.

The fic (which I will probably actually start writing in few months) is supposed to largely be the writing exercise, which means that: * It will probably suck * I will probably give up on it before I finish it * It will feature very big cast of characters (so I can try to make them all different) * There will be genre shifts between years (so I can try doing different things)

It's also largely representation of things I like or want to see in fics, so: * The focus will be largely on partially revamped and largely expanded magic system and worldbuilding. * I won't rehash canon plots (though two years will be similar to canon ones to certain degree) * School life will be a big part of the fic. * Characters will be skilled and proactive, but I will try to avoid making them overpowered. * Marauders will actually use their talents in making magical items instead of being put in some generic role like aurors (well James will still spend a lot of time on Quidditch). * There won't be first year kids fighting against Voldemort.

That's my platform, please vote for me.

I also had some lose ideas that I will probably never write.

- Battle Royale style fic that starts in Harry's fifth year. The Voldemort soul splintered into many fragments and entered into yet to be born kids. Now in the current third year (I think so, Brits assign kids to starting school year in some strange way) there are many child prodigies. And there are some very dangerous accidents around, many around Harry. Follow the Voldie-influenced kids who try to kill each other (and Harry) to get bigger part of the Tom's soul and Harry who tries to learn what the hell is going on.

- Crossover with Zero no Tsukaima with canon welding. Follow Harry Potter the young student of Hogwarts - Albion's magical academy in years leading to and during Cromwell's rebellion.

- Crossover with Mahouka Koukou no Rettoisei with HP characters transplanted into modified Mahouka setting. Didn't think much about the plot of this one, just got idea and checked if somebody did something like that.

- Crossover with Nasuverse with canon welding. But instead of having two different magical systems and societies, there would be one which would be mishmash of the craziest elements of both. Another one that I didn't think through and only checked if somebody did something like that. Seems like nobody did, but I've found Matou Shinji series this way.

** Ones I want to write:

- Cho and Harry post-Hogwarts fic, somewhat canon compliant. I'm in the process of planning it right now, and may attempt to write it for NaNoWriMo. It would be CC because Cho would have given up magic and married a Muggle, but it doesn't stay that way because she accidentally ends up entangled in the wizarding world again. Whether Cho and Harry end up together or just become close friends, I'm not sure yet, but I love both of them and feel that their failed relationship was partly just because it wasn't the right time for them. (For fuck's sake, Harry had just seen her boyfriend die... no wonder they had issues.)

- A fic about Hagrid and Myrtle and their time at Hogwarts. (Although they aren't friends in the fic.) Currently writing this one, but it's kind of on hold.

- A more lighthearted and funny femslash fic between two female Hogwarts professors, maybe Sinistra being one of them.

- A oneshot about Hagrid and Voldemort (Quirrell) meeting at the Hog's Head in SS.

Fics I'd like to read, but not necessarily write:

- A fic where both Draco and Harry go to Durmstrang (preferably if it were slash, but honestly I would read it even if it wasn't.)

- A fic where Dumbledore becomes the Defense professor at some point (this was inspired by the part in the Pureblood Pretense series where he taught some lessons.)

- Anything about Phineas Nigellus and his life.

*** Tempus is pretty good. Harry falls through time at Hogwarts and ends up in the 1920s when Phineas is headmaster. There is slash and Phineas is a dick (definitely read the warnings/tags) but it's the only one I've seen where Phineas is alive/not a portrait. Linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1875756]])

  Did you ever wonder where the Hogwarts disappearing corridors go--or when? When Harry Potter finds himself at Hogwarts in 1927 he never expected that the first person he would run into would be... Draco Malfoy?? 85,000 words. Written for the "hp_cliche" challenge in 2006, run by ReganV. Beta-read by Miraba. Harry is magically transported back to Hogwarts in 1926, and until they find a way to return him to 1997, he is enrolled as a student. The very first student he meets is a blond Slytherin named Draco Malfoy. A time without Voldemort gives Harry the chance to learn things about magic and himself, but that era is not without certain evils. Mixes mystery, romance, action/adventure, and first-time smut. Nominated for a Multi-faceted Award. Additional warnings: Corporal punishment, teacher/student, consensual BDSM as well as dubious consent, torture, alcohol consumption.

** Two fics, both centering around Harry and Sirius.

The first one, the one I'm actually working on (thanks, IRC people, like I really needed this) is the Arcadia verse, which has been something of an ideabox for me for several years. In the wake of Voldemort's fall, Harry finds a set of notes by a mysterious Unspeakable that theoretically allow one to open a portal to 'another dimension' (whether this means world or time, he's unable to verify) if only one had enough power to do so. It takes him a few years to work out the remaining pieces, and he arrives in what appears to be his own timeline, exactly 25 years back--just after Christmas of 1975. With full knowledge of the previous war, he makes fairly quick work of Voldemort, and is regarded as a hero here too much to his dismay. His influence manages to get him marriage proposals from a number of houses, and partially out of pure curiosity but mostly out of that whole Saving People thing, he accepts the Blacks' offer of a rebellious son ('he'll need some taming,' Walburga says with a scowl). The story mostly centers on the development of the relationship between Harry and Sirius, and the sweeping social and political changes which result from Voldemort's early defeat. What happens to child soldiers after the war is over (and in some cases, ended before they ever got a chance to fight in it) is a recurring theme. May include some elements of the MasterofDeath!Harry trope, because it's fun to play with.

The other is one I'm not sure I can write myself, but I'd love to read it someday. Sirius never manages to escape Azkaban, and after the war, Harry is posted there as the Auror on Duty for a six-month rotation. This being after the Dementors are gone, one of the guards points Sirius out to him as one of the prison's 'more interesting cases.' Harry gets curious about how he managed to survive and stay as sane as he did for so long, but their conversations seem to be worsening the man's condition. Not slash, just a gen fic.

** I have a few plans. Fudge wanted something big to show people he was an idea's man, something to impress the public now he'd scraped a win in the election. He gives them Harry Potter, the department of Mysteries might be able to reverse engineer a method to survive the killing curse and then the name fudge would go down in history. When the Dursley's were visited they were more than happy to sign Harry over to the minister. Deep within the department of Mysteries one of the unspeakables examining Harry spots something wrong with his scar, combined with the prophecy fudge is forced to take action. In an attempt to not let out swears them all to secrecy and gets some of the DMLE to raise Harry with the unspeakables. A task force brings him up and uses time-turners to accelerate his growth and learning. Fudge is worried about Dumbledore interferring with his plan to save the world and with the time acceleration he doesn't go to Hogwarts, he's not there to stop Sirius killing Pettigrew and it all spirals from there. At some point Fudge is assassinated and Harry goes to Hogwarts to teach DADA and train with Dumbledore. One of his classes is the year he was meant to be in. Things happen and it will end.

Another project I have planed is that after enduring the stares for a while decides to look up his own story. He's blown away by what he finds, that combined with the amount of people who expect him to be a great wizard its huge on a kid who never had any attention or recognition. In cannon he shuns this but this story he is humbled and desperate to please, this is the tale of what if Harry Potter tried to live to other's expectations. In his second year he finds a mentor in Lockhart, another person who is more famous than capable, someone who can survive on reputation alone.

A third one, this one is the hardest to conceptualize and the roughest outline. Its a WBWL tale but Dumbledore knew exactly which twin was responsible, however remembering a young James Potter he decides that the savoiur of the world shouldn't behave like that and it would never give the hero the attitude needed. He obliviates the Potters into believing Harry died and sends him to the Dursley's and does naughty things to ensure neither family contacts the other. Just before Harry turns eleven Dumbledore reunites the Potters who in the mean time have had to deal with issues based around the other twin being named BWL by the press. Harry after learning Dumbledore stole his parents memories and placed him with the Dursleys refuses to go to Hogwarts. At another magical school he explores Oblivation, who wouldn't want to understand what caused you all that trouble? from there he reads into occlumency as a possible defense. The story spirals from there into murky territories as Harry explores questionable but not illegal mind magic, compulsion, legilimency cheering charms, obliviation etc. He shows how terrifying it is that wizards can change what you think and deals with his issues but subverting his opponents minds, never using anything illegal but really it should be. Meanwhile his twin does normal things but The Potters are actually decent/nice human beings that try their best with their sons.

** I'd like to read a fic that followed a premise J.K. discarded early on: the Grangers lived near the Potters and they were the ones to get Harry out of the house that Halloween. I've seen a fic like this some years ago, but there were only 2 chapters, I think.

I started a fic called Normalcy last year, but it's pretty shitty and I've been thinking about scrapping it and doing it in another format. The story centers around the idea that Vernon was a little more violent than canon let on, and Petunia craved a normal life too much to accept a phisically abusive man. She would then take Harry and Dudley to start a new life away from Privet Drive. Don't know if I'll ever get back to this one.

I'd also like to read some new high quality Harmony fiction, but these seem to be scarce.

Lots of possible candidates for the serial killer too.

** My dream story that I just don't have the guts to try and write:

Harry Potter world, magic is real, muggles are third class citizens, kept as cattle. The ones in charge use muggles as test subjects to further their magic studies. Harry Potter is thought to /be/ one of these muggles, but on the day he is found to have magc he's taken from his "family". He is trained in magic for a while, before finding his old family and escaping. He, along with his family, stumble upon the last meeting ground for creatures- and meet the last goblin and centaur. I haven't really thought past that, but it seems like it can be good, no?

*** You'd have to explain why Harry would be thought a muggle. Is he actually a muggleborn in that story? Or how did the child of a wizard and witch end up growing up as a muggle, and was mistaken for being a muggle? What happens to other muggleborn children? And where would he be escaping to with his family?
