What does this sub-reddit community think of 'Broken Angel'. The good, the bad, the ugly, and anything else in between.

I remember reading this a while ago, and it has updated like crazy since then. It seems everytime I open my inbox, there was an update. What i'm asking for is, should I go back to reading it, because while I don't remember much, I can say that my taste is stories has changed a lot since then, and I don't want to read a bad god-like Harry story. I think a god-like Harry story can, and has been done right, but there are so many bad ones out there, and I don't want to start this monster of a story without knownig if it's going to be a good story.

** Seriously the username, the title, the description everything sounds like it´s written by an edgy triehard teen, also a Naruto/HP crossover, those two really don´t mix well, also saying that the story contains massive amounts of bashing like it´s some badge of honor? If this is actually good, it must be a small miracle.

** I read up to like 4year and well... It's not a bad story but I can't help but see plotholes everywhere once those two worlds are merged into one. I mean, ninjas in naruto can run faster than the eye can see, while wizard spells are light shows, shinobi can level entire towns with a jutsu while wizards can make wholes in doors..

Also, something that I hate.. They know that fem!harry is the new lady Slytherin, yet they still think the sister is the gwl?!?!

** The issue with harry potter and naruto crossovers is scale, particularly in combat. A genin in naruto is as capable as most wizards. In the series of harry potter i could only see 3 wizards fighting someone of Kakashi's level, and thats dumbledore grindlewald and voldemort.

End series naruto would be able to kill anyone in the harry potter universe, without hassle. The Avada Kedavra couldnt stop Naruto, because it has to hit him.

This story doesn't address that well. Plus, its trying to do too much. A crossover plus a wrong bwl plus fem harry plus harry With titles? Nah
