Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual (Doesn't have to be focused on a pairing)

Can be on ANY length, can be on ANY site, anyone can be the main character.

NO OP Harry, no Harem Harry, no Lord Potter. Harry slightly smarter, or slightly more powerful then in canon is fine, but I'd like for it to be believable as possible.

No Weasley bashing, if at all possible.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.

Other characters who died can also be alive in the story.


** This one manages to both be canon-compliant, and save Remus and Tonks:
