So the Department's job is to find magical artifacts/cursed objects left around muggles. But thing is, this objects tend to not be so easy to find or collect, so they have get close to the area where there is the suspiciousness of such items and covertly look around for them.

Considering that the cooperation of the muggles who possibly have had contact with the objects is essential, hiding magic long-term during the investigation is petty difficult and they have to find a believable reason for being there the Department, with all the competence you would expect from the Ministry, decided that it's agents would pose as babysitters during investigations... the results vary... very wildly.
