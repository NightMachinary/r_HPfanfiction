I'm putting together a political-type story dealing with the Wizengamot ousting Hermione as the Deputy Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement due to a youth terrorist organization killing rogue Death Eaters pardoned by the Ministry, and selecting Harry to take up her position. Therefore, I wanted to know what were some other good political Harry-type stories you know of. They can be of any nature though preferably when Harry (and company) are adults. I don't care for pairings as much though wouldn't be against it if it wasn't critical to the story itself. I'm open to whatever length and wish for the story to feature Harry and Hermione in /some/ capacity (whether that's as friends, enemies, or anything in between; I'm game for anything). And if there's already been a request of this nature, I apologize for creating a clone. Thanks in advance!


** If it were up to me, I would have Harry throwing his full weight behind Hermione and launching a de facto coup to oust that Wizengamot.

They brought out their own supporters in force, and took over the Street and the media. With Magical Britain's security forces fully loyal to Harry and Hermione, they arrested the key Wizengamot members pushing for Hermione's ouster and exposed them as hidden Voldemort sympathizers.

They uncovered more crimes and atrocities by those people, and they forced Kingsley to pardon those vigilantes who killed rogue Death Eaters.

*** As much as Hermione is Harry's friend I think it is a waste of potential power to support her.

My reasoning is as follows:

1. Hermione is a muggleborn. Regardless of the outcome of the war, prejudices will linger and change will come far easier if a pureblood leads it.

2. Hermione is female. The wizarding world seems patriarcharial from what we see in canon. Change would be far easier supported by a Male figurehead.

3. Bias. Hermione is Harry's friend. His support would mean far more and seem more legitimate behind someone he doesn't know as well. Grumble grumble nepotism grumble. These grumblings by the opposition would hold weight in this case.

**** Your reasons are nonsense, you seem to still labor under the illusion that the Ministry and Wizengamot were something all powerful.

No, ever since it was overthrown twice within that 10 months period, it was exposed as a paper tiger, a joke, and a failed state. Its postwar credibility would be solely built based on Harry and his friends. Its security forces were reconstituted from the veterans of the Battle of Hogwarts, who above all answered to Harry.

You have no idea what those in control of the military and street can do to some crooked politicians who still thought too important of themselves. Harry and Hermione would not just sit back and let the other side have the initiative. They would bring out their supporters in force to denounce the 'corrupt Wizengamot' that let those Death Eaters off the hook in the first place. They would dig out old dirt of those Wizengamot members. They would recount of the atrocities of Voldemort's reign of terror and "the Year of Darkness". Then they would arrest a few whom they knew had lots of dirt. Publishing their interrogation results would further rile up the populace and justify their actions.

This is how to fight life and death political struggles. You go on the offensive, you seize the narrative, and you push your advantages hard, especially if you have the support of the popular majority and the control of the military.

Finally, I want to point out that Harry and Co never paid much attention to laws and rules when they interfered with their goals/objectives. Hermione especially, only used laws to reign in others while routinely pissing on them herself.

If they were to make it to the top of that cesspool known as the British Ministry of Magic (according to JKR), they would no longer be your adorable innocent children or naive teenagers, but battle hardened warriors and ruthless politicians.

***** I believe my aforementioned points have merit; I don't see how you can call them nonsense. Tell me that muggleborn will be treated the same as purebloods. You can't. That's not how things work, just look at the treatment of African Americans after slavery ended. They were still treated like garbage. That's reality. We may not like the world, we may not like prejudice, /but it remains all the same./

Politics require *wealth, charisma, and breeding/status*. Hermione is not charismatic, she does not have wealth, and her status is arguable. This is the reality of politics, a place where Ms. Granger has no chance of flourishing. Hermione becoming Minister is about as likely as a Black President in 1875. Prejudice does not evaporate overnight. Rather than embracing Starfox syndrome realize that the odds are against Hermione, even with Harry's support.

If Harry and Hermione had the temperament of Frank and Claire Underwood you are correct, the ministry is ripe for the taking. But they don't. They are not looking to take over the Wizarding World but rather to recover from their losses. They are not ruthless enough to do what needs to be done and neither do they have the thirst for power/status.

"You have no idea what those in control of the military and street can do to some crooked politicians who still thought too important of themselves. Harry and Hermione would not just sit back and let the other side have the initiative. They would bring out their supporters in force to denounce the 'corrupt Wizengamot' that let those Death Eaters off the hook in the first place.

Then they would arrest a few whom they knew had lots of dirt. Publishing their interrogation results would further rile up the populace and justify their actions."

I do not see this happening at all. If all this was going to happen /then why didn't it occur after the first Wizarding War./ Voldemort's first fall did not cause true change to occur, Voldemort's second fall will not either. Harry is not a revolutionary, rather a 17 year old trying to survive a Dark Lord hell bent on killing him. All of what you say here is a tremendous assumption.

TLDR: My earlier points have merit. Hermione and Harry would not become politicians, but rather would grieve and try and gain the semblance of a normal life.

****** I don't think Harry and Hermione would immediately become politicians. However given the degree of injustice perpetrated by the Ministry and their devotion to combatting injustice, I don't believe they could stay out of politics indefinitely.

Their success wouldn't be guaranteed, but you are exaggerating Hermione's disadvantages and ignoring her advantages. Whether or not she benefits from her parents' wealth, she can certainly rely on Harry's, at least until he spends it all. She is described as unlovely through Harry's eyes, but that certainly isn't reflected in the opinions of other people. She certainly has tact, the ability to read people and force of personality.

Status is trickier. Being young and female are disadvantages (with potential upsides), but not ones that guarantee political failure. Unless someone actively suppressed the information, which would probably take her active agreement, Hermione is a war-hero with a couple of dramatic war adventure stories. Then there is blood status; anti-muggleborn prejudice in the Wizarding population is incredibly inconsistent. There's no political will shown to do anything other than call them names until people are fine with imprisoning and de-powering them. How much people would care about an issue of blood status that has no outward sign and is unfashionable to care about? I honestly think that is plot-dependent; something that has undeniable canon support both ways.

Ultimately, it's important to bear in mind that Wizarding Britain's population is tiny. Hermione simply doesn't have enough competition to need to be that charismatic, forceful and well-respected to be among the Wizarding population most politically eligible. Dumbledore's ridiculous amount of political sway, and even Lucius Malfoy's, show how vulnerable the Ministry is to anyone with respect or political power.

And she spent her time in the Ministry reforming - house-elf law, and, again according to Pottermore, discriminatory pro-pureblood laws.

So, in your AU, muggleborns might still not have such opportunities, but in canon, they most assuredly can raise to the top. (And, according to Pottermore, did so already in the 60s with the first muggleborn Minister.)

** A difficult ask.

holdmybeer's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6334630?view_full_work=true][The Sum of Their Parts]] has Harry give up on the Ministry and enlist Hermione and Ron to become a Dark Lord. It's a bit of a brute-force, immediate approach to politics, but it's a decent story.

AMarguerite's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3784000/1/The_Scarlet_Pimpernel][The Scarlet Pimpernel]] is set in the ministry in the period it was de facto run by the Death-Eaters. It's about Percy Weasley realising that he's in over his head (and his ex-girlfriend was right about everything) and being heroic anyway.

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/andrea13_and_persephone_kore/][Andrea13 and Persephone_Kore]]'s Stepbrothers series ([[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/andrea13_and_persephone_kore/TL01a.html][p]], [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/andrea13_and_persephone_kore/TSOB01a.html][1]], [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/andrea13_and_persephone_kore/ADY.html][2]], [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/andrea13_and_persephone_kore/GW01a.html][3]], [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/andrea13_and_persephone_kore/CGAS.html][4]], [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/andrea13_and_persephone_kore/SAS.html][5]], [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/andrea13_and_persephone_kore/CTA.html][6]]) has political themes. It's about Tom Riddle and Rubeus Hagrid navigating the Slytherin/Gryffindor divide in a world where Merope Riddle was an independent-minded Hogwarts attendee who lived to raise her son.

sepentre_set's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6109822][Harriet Potter Is]] has similar themes. It's a quick take on a female, Slytherin version of Harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Lightning on the Wave]]'s Sacrifices Arc has a school-age Harry grapple with several forms of systematic oppression, legal issues influenced by politics and situations where the political is very personal. It is very AU though, especially in terms of characterisation. (It holds together as a story, because it is very character-driven, but it's very odd to read, say, teenage Harry/Draco with the characters being highly mature and emotionally open.) The basic premise is that Harry had an identical twin and his parents collaborated with Dumbledore in emotionally abusing Harry into being his twin's bodyguard and servant.

Shadowblayze's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10051634/chapters/22395083][Triumphant, The Dreamer]] has quite a few interesting takes political issues in everyday life and a couple of brushes with Ministry, family and goblin politics. It's an incomplete fic about a self-insert/original-insert inserted as an infant Harry's twin sister, which spends quite a while on the Dursley years.

flamethrower's [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/755028][Of A Linear Circle]] series is intensely political (and full of political world-building). It is long, incomplete and regularly updated. The series is about the romantic relationship of Severus Snape with the portrait of Salazar Slytherin's brother. The two of them have a great deal of political opinions and they have to resolve issues with everything from the way the school is run to Queen Elizabeth II to the mis-taught history of the Hogwarts Founders.

That's every fic I know of.

** If the Wizengamot ousts Hermione, they'll certainly not install Harry in her place. They'd be braindead morons to do so. Replacing a muggleborn with her muggle-raised best friend, who shares her views on equality and bigotry? That makes no sense at all. All that would accomplish is for Harry and Hermione to rally their allies, and oust the Wizengamot. By force, if needed. I can't think of any reason why a politician would go "oh, let's get rid of the mudblood... Potter will be a much better choice!"

If you want a political Harry without Hermione overshadowing him thanks to her drive and passion for politics, make her not go into politics but research from the start. That way your Harry can do politics, and Hermione can support him between violating the laws of magic and nature.

****** But [[/u/starfox5]]'s point is that the summary of your fic you've given us makes no logical sense, and should probably be reworked to better fit the motives of a status quo-upholding Ministry would do.

***** Maybe they want to oust Hermione just to appease some people? Maybe they actually don't want to do so, so they select Harry knowing that he would still support whatever she was doing.

***** If Harry follows Hermione as deputy head, then everything he does is flavoured by what she's done. If he makes different decisions, is he right to value different things? If he manages things that she couldn't, will she finally have a reason to resent his fame? It's a whole different relationship dynamic.

** A Marauder's Plan by CatsAreCool features a LOT of politics - it has politcal Harry, but mostly a political Sirius Black. It covers Wizengamot proceedings in good detail. It's interesting, but long.

** It is an interesting idea, and I would love to read it when it is finished. I am curious though how you have made a magical goverment and electoral system. Have you build it after a current system, like the british with seats and constituents, or more of a presidential race like in America, or something else entirely?

*** I stayed with the notion that the Wizengamot still has 50 members in it. However, the Wizengamot itself has four main players: The Minister's Support Staff (they control 4% of the Wizengamot), the Department of Magical Law Enforcement (controls 18%), the public (controls 20%), and the Wizengamot proper (holds 58% of power). Then, the Wizengamot is further divided into Hermione supporters versus Hermione opponents. Hermione supporters are the Minister's Support Staff, the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, and the public. Together, they control 42% of the Wizengamot. However, Hermione opponents is the Wizengamot proper, and they control, again, 58%.

** I'm not surprised no one has mentioned this series, but I highly enjoyed it, especially the political aspects. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/37557][Charming Universe]] It is a Drarry, however. (I'm a Drarry shipper after all.) But it's a well written story. Draco is the one running for Minister.

** Quite a few stories by Keira Marcos at least touch on a political aspect, though I think the two that have it featuring more heavily and also featuring Harry and Hermione would be [[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/courting-hermione-granger/][Courting Hermione Granger]] and [[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/harry-potter-the-soulmate-bond/][Harry Potter and the Soulmate Bond]].

Also, another story by her is focused more on the political aspect, but is primarily centered on the James and Lily surviving and exercising the political power. I believe Harry and Hermione as a future couple is mentioned, but it isn't the focus of the story. This one is [[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/the-legacy/][The Legacy]] and Keira has mentioned future stories in the series to come at some future date.
