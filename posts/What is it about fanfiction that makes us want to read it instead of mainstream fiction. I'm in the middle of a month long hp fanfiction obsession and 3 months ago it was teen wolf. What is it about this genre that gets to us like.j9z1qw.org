***** I'm not saying that I've not read any other books in this time, but I started reading HP Fanfiction before 2000, when there were still books to come out. It was a wild time.

Its now 20 years later and I'm in my 30's, and still finding great HP Fanfiction to read.

I conservatively estimate that I've read almost a billion words of fanfiction over that time. Which when you write down seems like a lot, but 100k a week (a short fic) per week for 20 years is over a billion words, and there were some summer holidays where I'd read literally all day, every day.

I've read some bullshit over the years, but I still find some absolute gems, and still read at least a couple of chapters every day before bed.

I love it. Say what you want about JKRowling, but she managed to create a world that is easily riffed on.

****** True. I've been reading hp fanfic for about 2 years now and the possibilities are ENDLESS. like i have above 600 fics saved in my drive which are my favorite. I have easily read above 2000 fics and i STILL have unlimited reading material. And I'm deeply thankful to the fandom for providing me with such gems. Not just pwp or fluff, which are evergreen btw, but also magical theory being explored in them by writers. It's awesome and awe-inspiring.

As for jk Rowling .. idk much about the whole matter but as far as i know i don't let it affect me and I'm really sorry for those whose experiences have been tarnished because of all her drama and who are unable to enjoy it anymore.

** I'm not sure. Maybe it's the idea of going back to something familiar (that you know you already like) and being able to jump right in, rather than something new that you have to fully invest in before you know whether you'll get hooked?

Also, it could be that fanfiction, by necessity, has evolved to be extremely well-tagged and categorized (for the most part), so you tend to know what you're getting when you pic a fic, versus, say, reading the summary on the back of a new book.

I have certain fiction I'll reread with the same idea (Laurie King Sherlock Holmes, Melanie Rawn's Sunrunners' series) - worlds I can jump back into. Fanfic however is literally endless.

** Fanfiction is often based on pre-existing characters, and it's either canon compliant or it creates an alternate universe based on it. Fanfic allows you to re-explore your favorite fictional universes and spend time with your favorite characters in different settings and universes. But the thing is with fanfic, you're ALREADY in love with that universe and those characters. That's what made you seek and stay in fic in the first place. In books, however, you're reading without that existing sense of tenderness. You don't know if you'll like these characters or this book at the end.

Fic is almost always focused on relationships, and you kind of already know where it's going. You know that those two will end up together (unless there's a ‚Äòsad ending' tag somewhere). So in a way, when you read fic, you're not as clueless as when you read a fiction book with original characters. There isn't that learning curve, that wonderful frustrating phase in which you try visualizing the characters and building an image of them in your head. Because you already know what they look like or you already have a clear picture.

** I'd wager a large portion of it also had to do with accessibility, ease of browsing, and low initial investment. It's really easy to read fanfiction wherever I want and without the guilt of a pirated book, I read translations of asian web novels on novel updates for the same reason.

I read very quickly so going to the library every time I want a new book is annoying and my local library's ebook selection is pretty lame. It's also annoying to have to spend a lot of time finding something interesting, with fanfiction I can pretty easily tell (especially with tagging and such). Again I appreciate this on novel updates too.

I also feel a lot more okay about quitting in the middle of a fanfiction than a published novel. If I get bored, I'll just bookmark my page and try something that better suits my mood. With a published book I tend to feel like I have to finish it.

The way I typically justify it in my mind is "would I buy this if I couldn't find it online?" Before I got into fanfiction I mainly read paperback romance novels, I can find them for 50 cents at a library sale.

Meanwhile, my brother buys every english translated copy of the Overlord light novels even though he prefers the fan translation just so that he can support the author.

This is literally me. I used to go to the library and bring back 12 books (the maximum on one card) or maybe 24 if I could convince my mother to let me use my sister's card (which is basically also my card because my sister doesn't read unless forced) but I get very achy joints, particularly my knees ( I'm 14, I was 10 the first time I got this pain, it's ridiculous) but it means that it's too difficult for me to walk to the library (30-40 min walk) and then walk back with even half the amount of books. So fanfiction is my go-to because I've read all the books I own. If I do make a trip to the library, it's usually to research and take notes so I just grab my usual desk and make a day of it, ask the librarian to put the book(s) aside if I know I'm returning the next day and do it that way.

** wish fulfillment and predictability.

children like the same show or movie over and over because the unfamiliar is strange and sometimes confusing. everything is confusing at that age so having a few runs at it until it's familiar and therefore enjoyable. while largely exhibited in children it can become a coping mechanism in adults.

a major aspect is wish fulfillment. not just in the wank type of things but because you are familiar with how a character acts many stories are placing familiar characters in new settings. having a firm grasp of their background and personality allows you to predict and path a story along with a character meaning you can more quickly get invested in plot lines.

it's kind of like the familiarity of certain video games playing it again does largely nothing for the story the twists and turns having been unraveled but you the player get immersed into in a way you weren't before. the confusion of map layouts, quest markers or objectives turned smooth and precise. playing heroic on halo after finishing it on legendary turns an experience that should still be difficult into one of smooth and effortless forward momentum.

** I guess it could be the option of being able to find the exact type of story you want with your favorite comfort characters. You don't have to worry about learning the lore or environment because you already know that. So now you can focus on a plot with supporting elements that suits you. I think another plus is being able to explore topics to the fullest extent without being censored or toned down. I personally used to read a ton of books in both highschool and middle school that were ya and set in fantasy worlds. But for the most part they always focused on the same tropes and never explored the tropes that interested me. Like darker themes or even what might happen after the world stops ending for the characters and they can just be ppl. So now I can choose a trope and find a million other stories just like it all for my favorite characters. I think fanfiction allows you to continue a story that you weren't ready to let go of quite yet.

** 15 years in HP, and although I've added other fandoms to my roster and have a bunch of favorite fics scattered all over the map, HP easily overshadows them all.

One thing that struck me when I started writing in HP after being a reader for a couple of years was how utterly self-indulgent you're allowed to be. You can whip the emotions to a ridiculous pitch and push them over into melodrama. You can wallow in your most extreme tropes. You can milk that heartbreak, go into lavish detail with that sex scene, basically have an orgy of cheap thrills. I don't mean this critically. I'm just aware that if I were writing pro fic, I would pull way, way back from the emotional scenery, exercise more control over structure and content, and not include scenes that are primarily there to satisfy my id.

So I think that's part of it. Fanfiction's self-indulgence is pure escapism. It can be raw and unembarrassed and utterly infatuated. It doesn't take work to read, and it often has that quality of writers writing shamelessly, point blank, for a community they know shares their obsession. The fact that so many of us get our tastes catered to creates a feedback loop of belonging and shared pleasure (and sometimes, of course, raging ship wars).

We're writing our fantasies through the medium of HP. It's very seductive and wonderfully familiar and larger than life.

- HP didn't age very well for me. When I read canon, all I see is the plotholes, inconsistencies, and all around weird stuff.
- JKR keeps adding and retconning ALL THE TIME.
- The "Harry Potter" series is a fantasy story that takes place in a magic school. Magic is present, but it's not the main focus. Fanfiction can focus on the magical aspect. Really flesh it out.
- I like seeing an actual happy ending, instead of what JKR pulled out of her rear with deus ex machina and said that was a happy ending. It wasn't.

** A bunch of reasons:

1) It's free. Although that may sound stupid the ability to try lots of different fics is important.

2) It's on the internet and so you don't need your kindle reader or a physical book, you can just open a browser and there you go. Anywhere your phone is, so is fanfiction.

3) The world is already built. With any new book you are taking a gamble on if the world and the characters within are something that you will be interested in. By and large you already know what you're getting with fanfiction so you dodge this problem.

4) Regular updates. This might seem like a downside but as opposed to normal reading this means fanfics come in bite sized chunks that you can read bit by bit in the style of old newspaper/magazine stories that have been popular for decades in the past.

5) The variety. With normal books you might buy a romance novel or a fantasy novel. With fanfiction you are getting an Indy!Haphne starting in the triwizard tournament. This means the stories are much more closely catering to your interests.

I'm sure there's other reasons too.

** A few people have said similar things, but I believe it's largely about the dissonance between the familiar and unfamiliar.

You know how things are supposed to be, so it's comforting when they are that way, and intriguing when they aren't.

It's like if something woke you up at 5 AM and you go to your window, and see the world outside at sunrise for the first time.

Besides which, the concept of "what if?" is infinitely fascinating to a lot of people (myself included), and the wide array of imaginations pushing and pulling at the fabric of stories we know and, at some point, at least, loved, creates a vast array of sunrises, each distinctly, uniquely, painting the familiar world outside our window.

** I think it's because when you start a new book you never know if you're going to like it or not and you have to get to know all the characters from zero. With fanfiction it's different you take a world you're already familiar with, a world that you know you like and can actually look for plots that appeal your interest. Books have a set course. Fanfictions have miriad of options, and if you like one concept, but you don't like how it's expressed by that author, there'll probably be a thousand more ready to fulfill your curiosity. And if you want more, there is always more. And if there isn't, wait a day, a week, a month even and there'll be. With fanfiction you can explore what ifs and sides of characters that left you hungry for more in the actual book.

I read constantly everyday yet I haven't touched an actual book in I don't know how long. Everyday I wish I could go back to books but rarely I find one that can hold my interest for long enough.

I find that even if a fic is written by a dude who, say is obsessed with trains, for some reason I fond it 10x more interesting than a published book. Which...there must be something about the editing process that takes out the personal touch or something?

I also find things like dialogue are more natural more often than not in fic, particularly female characters, though it's amateur writing so maybe I'm more forgiving when it's not? I don't know.

But the biggest part for me is that fan fic is more likely to have people like me in it, and people like other people as well. instead of just being all white cast with a token black person or whatever.

maybe the biggest thing is most published fiction has the main character being some blank slate to be projected onto, where as fan fic authors are doing the projecting, so it's therefore more detailed and interesting, even if it's super Harry or whatever.

anyway that's a few reasons, but there are a thousand reasons really

** Up until this last year I had pretty much exclusively read HP fanfiction every day since 2003. I enjoyed seeing interesting concepts come to life, authors adding such breathe and width to canon characters whom we only knew their names. Getting to watch an author grow as a writer, I'm talking about you Joe6991, is pretty damn special.

Last year though, I just could not get through any new stories. I tried going back to some favorites that I have read numerous times before to get that spark back, but even they failed to hold my interest. It was at that point that I decided to take a break and read normal fiction for a while, catch up on my long backlog of recommended works over the years. Best decision ever! I rekindled my love for Space Operas and high fantasy. I've read through tons of classic literature that didn't mean much to me in highschool but now in my 30's resonates with me.

I still check this sub and other sites for HP recs on the regular, but for the most part I think I am done with Harry Potter. There's just too many interesting stories out there with their own magic just waiting to be explored and cherished.

** My thoughts:

1. Familiarity: You already know the setting, the characters, and many of the plot elements. This makes it less adventurous but more comfortable.
2. Predictability: Related to #1, the summary and tags on a fic can give you a pretty decent idea of the type and tone of story (usually), so you know what you're getting into. Common fanfic tropes also play into this factor.
3. Selection: With the variety of stories out there, it's often possible to find exactly or almost exactly the kind of story you're looking for, no matter how niche your interests (especially on AO3).
4. Interconnection (a.k.a. Rabbit-Hole Phenomenon): One fic leads you to another to another to another. Ever get lost on a wiki dive? Same thing.

Combine that with just how accessible the two main fanfiction sites make it and you have a recipe for success.

Finally, there is also the fact that if you don't get on with a story you can just stop and find another to read with the only cost being your time. Sites like royal road do the same for original fiction, some of which also gets published (I've bought a few that I really enjoyed). I think it's why amazon introduced kindle unlimited so that published books would get the same treatment while also paying the authors a little bit.

I go through phases where I read and write a lot of fic. Those are generally times in my life when I'm struggling a bit more for any number of reasons. During the last three months I've written over 180k (in the process of editing and posting, I only give my beta reader complete stories), which I haven't done in years, but being shut away all the time left me quite lonely and anxious and with a lot of time on my hands. Writing Harry Potter fic has been a comfort to me during this as in a way it feels to me like coming home to somewhere safe.

Fic is incredibly easy to access as well. My local library had a rather limited selection and I limit myself to how many books I can buy in a month (thank goodness for ThriftBooks).

Good luck to all of you, I hope you find what you're looking for.

** A couple things for me. 1 would be familiarity. With fanfiction you know the characters in a way which just /cannot/ happen in published fiction. Even reading a super long series like A song of ice and fire only really lasts for about 500-800k words for the whole series, when you get into faction though... You read stories with the same characters, for /millions/ of words. That's a familiarity which just becomes more and more comfortable. And when you get sick of it... Ohh bash fics! SI's! Dark!whoever fics! So yeah I think familiarity is a big factor.

2, it's free. Yeah books actually cost a shit ton if you read a lot. I've got depression and I read near constantly. That's means about 250k words a day if I get on a roll. If I had to pay ¬£10 per 100k word book you can bet I wouldn't read as much. With fanfiction I can just guzzle as many stories as a want, and if I run out or it gets stale there's a bunch of other fandoms, and then there's RRL, SB and SV etc. Just so much free fiction to digest and I can't get enough.

So that's my take on it. Familiarity and Free.

1. It's free. Books can be quite expensive.
2. We're familiar with the characters and setting so it's like going back to something you know. I'm honestly reluctant to start a new tv series because it will either suck or will be good, but get canceled prematurely.
3. Sometimes it's so bad that it circles back to good. I can't really explain it, but sometimes I really like bad fics with lots of tropes. It's like reading trashy romance novels but with magic, I guess.
4. The naughty stuff. Not all people are into it, but it bears mentioning nonetheless. Sometimes you just want to see your favourite (adult) characters in unlikely positions and/ or relationships.

That being said, I've found I need breaks from fanfiction occasionally. Sometimes the tropes can get a bit much. I've been eyeing the Book of Dust pt.2 for a while now.
