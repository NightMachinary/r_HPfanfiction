Author [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/604762/ksomm814][ksomm814]] re-writes JK Rowling's books starting with PoA under the premise of "what would have happened if Sirius helped out Harry before going to Hogwarts after Peter?". Everything spirals from there as Harry and his new support team meet the troubles in his remaining years at Hogwarts with a new attitude and new decisions. Series starts with [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2052919/1/Midnight-Guardian][Midnight Guardian]] and includes sequels [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2113521/1/Trials-of-a-Champion][Trials of A Champion]], [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2212077/1/Burden-of-a-Destiny][Burden of A Destiny]], [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2494921/1/Power-of-Hogwarts][Power of Hogwarts]], and [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2929702/1/Rise-of-the-Protector][Rise of the Protector]]. May be one of the best Harry Potter Fanfictions I've ever read.

*** It's pretty much all I've done in my free time for the past week. It's obviously shorter than the books and things tend to go a little bit smoother for Harry overall, but it's a great re-write of the story.

*** By far this is one the greatest fanfics I've read. It's definitely the best completed series I've read. I don't know if you are interested or not, but I'm slowly compiling a [[http://www.reddit.com/r/LordTalon/comments/10659n/harry_potter_fanfiction/][list]] of all the HP fanfics I've read and enjoyed. It's totally incomplete and I haven't even begun to add descriptions, but there is a wide variety of stories that at the very least have a good premise or idea that I want to return to in the future.

** One of the best ever...it's so addicting. I have gotten nothing done for a week in my desperate need to finish this series. Only one more to go and I am afraid I won't get much of it read before I go on vacation for the weekend away from a computer. But will be back to it monday!

*** If you have an iPhone or iPod touch download the app called PocketFiction. It can link up with your ff.net account, if you have one, and will show all your favorite story's and authors, plus you can still access and read your saved story's without needing to be connected to the internet. I really love that app.
