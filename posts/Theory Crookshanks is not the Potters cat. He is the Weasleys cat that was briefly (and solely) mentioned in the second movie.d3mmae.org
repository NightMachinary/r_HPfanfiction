/Ginny (pounding down the stairs): "Mummy, have you seen my jumper?"\\
Mummy: "Yes dear, it was on the cat."\\
Ginny sees Harry.\\
Harry: "Hello."\\
Ginny runs away/.

That is said scene in question, written from memory so it's probably not entirely accurate.

The Potters cat is only ever mentioned as having been traumatised by a child with a toy broomstick. It likely went on living in Godrics Hollow, as a stray, or getting adopted by some random Muggle. Or it was an unfortunate victim of Voldemort. He seems the type to kick cats.

The Weasleys cat, is only ever mentioned once, in the aforementioned scene. It likely ran away or got given away because none of the Weasleys ever paid attention to it. It may have also been the unwilling recipient of forceful dressings, which may have been the cause for it running away.

So let's look at the "facts".

The potters cat:

- Would be 13+ by the time of Prisoner, likely closer to 15. That's something that would be noted in its behaviour and appearance.\\
  But Crookshanks is never suggested to be old, in either appearance or action. In fact, he acts pretty young, chasing various creatures and exploring.

- Would likely have some positive reaction to Harry.\\
  But Crookshanks basically ignores him

- How would it get from Godrics Hollow to Diagon Alley, taking 13 years to do so?

Now, the Weasleys cat:

- The Weasleys are well known for being redheads. In fact, anything with a ginger colouring is automatically identical to the Weasleys. We know that because Ginny is quite obviously a spitting image of Harry's mother due to them both being redheads. As such, their cat would obviously be ginger coloured.\\
  Crookshanks is a ginger coloured cat.

- Any cat would likely hold a grudge for its neglectful life/forced jumper wearing at the Burrow.\\
  Crookshanks immediately demonstrates antipathy for Ronald Weasley and his pet.

- Harry, who visited the Burrow but never saved the poor cat from overdressing would likely fall into the cats bad books.\\
  Crookshanks more or less ignores Harry for the entire series.

- The Burrow is full of gnomes.\\
  Crookshanks is mentioned to enjoy chasing gnomes. Sounds like he's just reliving his childhood at the Burrow.

The clear conclusion to draw here is that Crookshanks is the Weasleys cat. He left the Burrow after a harrowing life of neglect and forceful dressings. This may have been on his own volition, hoping to make a better life on his own, or the Weasleys may have given him his freedom, in a rare moment of pity.\\
When Ron entered the Magical Menagerie, Crookshanks took the opportunity to get some revenge on the neglectful boy, and attacked him.

This got him adopted by Hermione, which both gave him the opportunity for revenge on the Weasleys, and an owner who would probably not neglect him. (He was likely terrified when Hermione started knitting clothes for her House Elf campaign).\\
His chosen method of revenge was, of course, his cunning plan to kill or evict the Weasley families pet rat, with the help of Sirius Black. They chased away one pet (him), so Crookshanks would chase away another.

Considering that people consider the Potters cat theory to actually be legitimate, I'll clarify here that this is just a bit of fun and I'm not being serious

*** Was it? That makes sense. I just figured it was some quirky wizard thing, or the cat was sleeping under her jumper for warmth. Or Ginny liked dressing the cat up, of course

***** Huh. That's honestly a little disappointing. Like you said, it's something thats always been stuck in my head because of the casual delivery of something odd. Ah well, I'll just say they got the hanger to replace the cat since Ginny liked to store her clothes on the cat

***** The general proof is that they're animals who aren't skittish around humans, are capable of understanding human speech, and are unusually intelligent. If you look around the HP main sub, you'll see someone post [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/4y0zzj/theory_about_filchs_cat_mrsnorris_animagus/][a theory thread]] at least once a week.

The [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Mrs_Norris][fandom wiki]] notes it too.

  "Mrs Norris seems exceptionally smart for a cat, to the point that many have suspected she is a cat/Kneazle cross like Crookshanks or an Animagus. However, J. K. Rowling has stated on her website that she is just a highly unpleasant cat."

*** I kinda figure that, in pet shop terms, 'forever' would be a year or two at most. Unless it's something rare and valuable, they wouldn't keep it after that point. Feeding it alone would vastly outweigh any profit from selling it after a time
