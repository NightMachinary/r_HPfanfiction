From what I remember it had Harry being taken abroad by Lupin and Dumbledore declaring Neville as Harry Potter instead. TIA


** If you mean Neville being made into a Harry Potter duplicate, you're probably looking for Two is a Crowd.

Neville being declared the Boy Who Lived or the Chosen One, though, with a Powerful Harry? Harry Potter and the Stargate is a recent one, by Sinyk, that seemed well liked. There are others, surely.

  James Potter trusted Sirius like a brother. Lily trusted Remus even more. How far will a friend go to honour this trust and to protect her son? What is Dumbledore's backup plan after losing the one and only boy-who-lived? And how will the public react when they learn about the truth? It is time for the tri wizard tournament. It is time for the truth to be reveiled.

  What if Remus was not... quite... as fast as he needed to be to catch Harry before he tried to get to Sirius in front of the Veil of Death. And what if the Veil was not what the magicals believed it to be? Oops! AU HP/LL Bash!AD/RW/GW (as my usual).

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating
