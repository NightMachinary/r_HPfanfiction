I see a lot of authors requesting for readers to leaving story/plot ideas in reviews. I think this reveals a lot about the story you are reading. It shows at the very least that the the author hasn't fully outlined their plot, or they are flexible with their plot.

This isn't always a bad thing necessarily. It can be a great way for authors to interact with their readership. I think authors should be open to changing their ideas if better ones present themselves. It seems like a reasonable thing for slice of life or situational comedy fics that have a relaxed or meandering plot because they are character driven or situational. I've read a lot of ANs where the author thanks readers for suggesting some pretty awesome or hilarious ideas that would have otherwise been absent from the fic (example: Make a Wish by Rorschach's Blot).

On the other hand, this is a pretty big red flag for fics that are meant to be plot driven or are based upon a premise that can only succeed if there is a a clear beginning middle and end. This is how you end up with fics that are extremely long (300k+ words) that don't really go anywhere. The author doesn't have a clear idea of where the story is going or how to get there.

*tl;dr: So what do you think, is this a fun way for authors to interact with their readers, or is it indicative of poor planning?*


** Hrm. Are we talking about an "I am good at writing things. Anyone have a nice seed of an idea to write into something?" or an "I goofed and broke the story. Any ideas on how to fix my plot holes?"

TBH, even in the latter case, there's nothing /wrong/ with asking for help.... especially since a reasonable number of us readers are also authors.

For that matter, there's also the "I see multiple futures from this point, and am indifferent between them. I want to have reader participation, so choose!"

That's a good point. There's nothing wrong with asking for help, but I don't think that is the type of thing you do in an end of chapter AN.

Where else would you ask? It makes sense to me that you'd want input from people who are already familiar with your story's current state, so that seems like the optimal point to put the question if you're going to ask it anywhere.

** I'm actually reading a story right now in which the author asks for ideas to further the story. In the first author's note, the author said that he/she (not sure which gender) had already written six or so chapters, but nothing afterwards; therefore, he/she wanted ideas in the form of reviews.

To me, it just seems sloppy and poor planning (even though I do find the story - the first six or so chapters okay, though nothing amazing).

I think the main problem I have with authors on FanFiction is that they try to focus on two different genres (i.e. romance and action), yet they can't find a balance between them, and instead, focus on one or the other, while blatantly ignoring its pair. This is the case with the story I'm on right now (with the author asking for ideas of where to take the story): It's trained solely on action, yet the romance is quite dull and nonexistent.

Perhaps with a fair bit of planning, this could have been avoided, but what if the readership wants more action, or more romance? Then you'll have a divergence of ideas of where the future of the story is headed, and thus, the whole thing will end up in a big mess with readers not happy.

As a FanFiction author myself, I try to have a beginning and end, with a premise that works within the two points and go from there.

** I need some ideas right now, so I'd appreciate that.

Also, since I'm an American, I'd need help visualization and conceptualizing what adult Muggle characters would feel about such things as magic, homosexuality, etc. in the 90s. (e.g. where and how would a milkman and his family live, how they'd react to how Harry was raised)

** I don't have a problem with writers asking for input or ideas, but as with everything else it has to be within reason. Depending on quality of the writing and if I like the story I am happy to provide feedback / suggestions. Lot of stories are written "organically" one chapter at the time and immediately posted. So story will often end up different than writer imagined in the beginning. However I would draw a line between writers who have a planned out plot outline and know in general where their story is going and those that just write stuff without any direction.

Strangely enough sometimes (though rarely) it's the latter kind of stories that end up being most fun and interesting and unpredictable.

** I only ever do this with pairings. I'm a romantic and think of various plot points centered around various pairings, yet I can never decide which to pick, so I ask the readers what they'd be most interested in.

** All my stories were complete before I started posting. I can't imagine doing it any other way. So yes, it shows lack of planning which probably equates to a poor story. I really don't see how a badly planned story could be any good.

*** most mangaka (or other serialized works for that matter) work that way they don't plan the story from beginning to end this gives them the liberty to change the story depending to readers reactions which helps considering how the medium works. and i can say i have read really good stories written/drawn with that method. the only thing that really matters is the ability of the writer and his imagination

** It depends on the fic. It's a shame that planning in advance doesn't happen more often in fanfiction, I've adopted this approach for my fic - I know exactly how it's going to end up. I am finding myself adjusting along the way, but it's a good idea to at least know what the end objective is.

** Story ideas for whole stories, likely one-shots, are fine by me. The same about cases where something went wrong and the author is asking for ideas on how to fix it because they don't want to be forced to rewrite however much stuff they would otherwise have to.

Making the readers decide what happens in the story because the author doesn't know where to take it, on the other hand ... well, /rarely/ I can see that as not bad, but a lot of the time it is not a good sign.

** I'm writing a HP/Naruto xover and I recently asked my readers about Naruto's team after he graduates the academy. (he gets better at ninjutsu and stuff so it doesn't make sense for him to end up in the same team) the thing is that the story takes place two years before that and the current arc ends about one year before Naruto graduates. this because i'm already planing the sequel got some good ideas that I would have never considered.

So i think as long as you have and ending planed asking for ideas from the reader can help refine your storyline for the better

plus I got more reviews in that chapter than the other ones, twice as much :P

** If it's minor I don't think it's indicative of poor storytelling. Stories develop in ways the author doesn't expect sometimes and asking for further ideas for a small plotline is fair (I've seen authors ask about minor character relationships which is not as egregious as asking about larger plotlines).

I think it's also perfectly reasonable to ask for ideas for humour or crack stories in particular as they have less constraints as plotted stories. Asking the audience for a funny joke or something they want the character to do is a great way of engaging with the audience.

** Strange - isn't that what a writer should do himself? I mean having some ideas and bouncing them off of other people - fine! But not having any ideas yourself and asking others to provide them? Really kind of strange!

** I think a lot of writers have a good idea of the beginning and end and main developments in the middle. However, they might find that the middle part is still a bit sparse. This is when many people would ask readers for ideas to populate it, I think. By collecting suggestions from readers, they would be able to thicken the story with sideplots, or add complications into their main plot - producing a more interesting story overall.

i.e. many people know where they're going with the story, but they're asking readers to suggest a more scenic route to get there.

So yeah, I think asking for help is a great idea.

** This should never, ever be done, unless the idea is so vague as "a new fic in the Harry Potter fandom."

First of all, it makes the author look rather dense and unimaginative (yes, I know the same argument is often applied to fanfic in general. But the buck has to stop somewhere). A great part of writing is the use of imagination, and an author is not displaying that when he or she has to resort to asking readers for ideas. To me, it comes across as review whoring.

Second of all, there is no way you are going to be able to include every plot idea readers suggest. Any new plot or subplot is difficult to write into a story which you already have most planned out. In addition, the fans whose ideas are not included may take badly to it.

Lastly - and most importantly - we have the dubious morality and 'legality' of it. We on this sub write fanfiction, which is and of itself legally dubious, and exists only by the grace of certain kind authors. When you use someone else's ideas in your writing, you leave yourself open to future retaliation. I've seen enormous dramas unfold because someone claimed, "oh, you stole my idea." Even if you have proof that the reader tactility granted you permission to use their idea, what if they later change their minds? How would moderators on fanfiction websites deal with it? However it worked out, it would be an enormous headache for the author. The potential for problems with it is too great.

** I've gotten a lot of good ideas from people, even when I don't ask them for story ideas. The only things I've recently asked about were...

1) regarding who should be the Hogwarts Champion in the Triwizard Tournament (Cedric, or someone else just to be different -- ended up with a poll in which the winner was totally unexpected, so that was neat!),

2) Hermione's parents names.(Another poll)

3) and ideas for original Tournament tasks, so I wouldn't be repetitive.

Those seem like okay things to ask for. Other stuff that really affects the plot and could affect the original plans an author makes, that isn't stuff to ask for ideas about.

To be completely honest, I do find asking for story ideas a hell of a lot better than reviewers asking ME to write something for them. I do not do that!
