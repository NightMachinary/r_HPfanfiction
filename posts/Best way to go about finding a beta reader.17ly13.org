** If you have a livejournal account, subscribe to hp_betas. You can post a bit of info there and ask for some beta help.

** I got my wonderful beta by putting in an author's note that I was looking for one, and someone wonderful who was enjoying Even Unto the Seventh Generation volunteered. I think it helped that the writing/grammar was already fairly clean, so the job looked enjoyable.

For Unthinkable Acts, I ask an in-real-life friend for advice.

For my one-shots, I try to edit as closely as possible, and when necessary I ask a family member (hubby for normal stuff, my mother--a social worker--when I need to know if I got a mental illness right).

*** Thank you very much! This is really good advice. I'm not sure if what I have is worth putting up somewhere, and really I want a beta just to have another set of eyes on it (so that maybe it could be worthy one day). I will definitely ask some of my friends if it comes down to it, but not even my family knows that I write at all. Last resort maybe? Thanks again!

** What would the job as a beta reader entail? Would you be involved in the planning of the future chapters and the story in general or only give feedback and criticism on what you have already written?

Also. Could you tell us a bit about your story? You might find a beta reader on reddit as well ;)

**** Aha. Well whatever tickles your fancy ;) I wouldn't touch those stories for the life of me, but that's just my opinion. Have you tried talking with one of your friends first? Even though it is a fanfic it should also function a real story, and if they think something is amiss... There probably is. Good luck with it.
