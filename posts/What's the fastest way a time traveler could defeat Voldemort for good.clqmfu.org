My idea: Owl Quirrelmort a portkey straight into the Veil of Death. Wouldn't stop the year 2 plot but it'd probably take care of main!Voldemort.

Edit: Also depends on the type of time travel, if it's free go-to-any-time or wake-up-in-young-body style.


** Go back in time and actually get newborn Tom adopted by some nonmagic couple, thereby making him able to grow up in a loving, normal family as a muggleborn.

** Get newborn Tom adopted by some loving non-magical couple in another country.

Then steal books about Horcruxes from the Hogwarts library.

** Assuming classic, Peggy Sue travel to Harry's 1st year:

Night of the sorting:

1. Stun Scabbers

2. Sneak out to Hagrid's Hut and get a rooster

3. Go to the Chamber and kill the Basilisk

4. Go to the Room and destroy the Diadem

5. Return to your dorm

6. Obliviate Scabbers to have a false memory of attacking you (Harry) as you slept, then curse him across the room and pretend in the chaos that you have no idea who he is or what's going on

Then wait for Sirius to be freed - as soon as he is, go to Grimmauld and destroy the locket

Relax till end of term then stop Quirrelmort.

Wait till Diagon, then get the Diary from Ginny's cauldron.

Then we're at the hard part - breaking the trace and finding an excuse to apparate to the Gaunt Shack for the ring, and both an opportunity and plan for breaking into Gringotts. But, since Tom Riddle was able to kill his muggle family in the holidays while under 17, the ring is doable. The cup, I think the best system is a modified version of the canon heist - one person under the cloak, imperio a goblin to take a cart to the Lestrange vault. Cloak isn't affected by Thieve's Downfall, and a re-application of imperio will keep the goblin on side. Then destroy the cup in the vault, and leave in your cloak with the imperiused goblin.

Assuming you could do breaking the trace without too much trouble, this could be done in just over a year.

** A few options that come to mind:

Steal the philosopher's stone and conquer the world yourself using an inexhaustible army of homunculi, then have Voldemort and his Horcruxes destroyed at your leisure.

Travel back to before Merope started dosing Riddle Sr. with love potion and dose the Little Hangleton water supply with antidotes to all known love potions, making Merope's potion useless.

Prevent Merope Gaunt from dying and making Tom an orphan.

Figure out a way to make /everyone/ magical in the future, and apply it in the past. If everyone is a wizard, there's no anti-muggle prejudice.

** Kill Tom Riddle as soon as he's born. Or depending on your definition of quick, go murder one of his ancestors.
