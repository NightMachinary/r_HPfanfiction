I've just read a couple of fics (Innocent and A Marauder's Plan, linked in comments) where Sirius takes Harry in and truly acts like a father/uncle/guardian after leaving Azkaban, and I'm looking for more. Fics where Sirius takes Harry in after POA or escapes earlier are fine, but I would prefer fics where Harry is raised by the Dursleys for a while. To me, fics where Sirius raises Harry from 1981 take away too much of the pain that shapes both of their characters. Thanks in advance for your help!

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

** In my AU story "Patron", Sirius is Harry's Guardian in 4th year (started in 3rd year, actually, since Sirius remembered that he could write a letter to Remus after he escaped, and so Pettigrew was captured without a fuss, but the story starts in year 4.)Sirius might not look it, and has his share of faults, but he shows quite the insight into Harry there.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** In *The Accidental Bond*, linkffn(5604382), the modified Trio was significantly more competent than their canon version. They had questions about Sirius' behaviors, so they interviewed a bunch of people including McGonagall, Hagrid, and Lupin; sent a owl letter to Sirius asking for his version of the story; and got a reply from Sirius telling them where Wormtail was. From then on, it was all smooth sailing, and Sirius played a significant role later on.
