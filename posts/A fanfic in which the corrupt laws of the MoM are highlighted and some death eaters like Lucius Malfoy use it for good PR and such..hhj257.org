:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Okay so I'm looking for this dark atmosphere fic that's about the corruption of pure-bloods and how they abuse loopholes in the law specifically created by them and for them.

I remember in this fic that Lucius Malfoy would donate tons of money to these fake charities and organisations only for the money to end back up with him or be used for corruption.

For instance: donating to a muggleborn Hogwarts tuition fund but because muggleborns have limited rights they can't use said money and instead it ends up in the 'ministry' where Malfoy uses it to bribe corrupt officials.

I might have read about it in 'international tri-wizard tournament' or 'the sum of their parts' or a completely different fic. I don't quite remember ):

Can anyone help me out? It's an oddly specific request but I'm always up to read some good Malfoy-bashing. I remember the tone of the fic being quite dark so it's no crackfic for sure. I also think it was a fairly recent fanfic.
