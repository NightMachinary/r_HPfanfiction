Any good stories where H/Hr get together when Ron leaves, that continues during the battle and after Hogwarts? Maybe sleeping together once, ignoring it when Ron gets back but suddenly Hermione is pregnant, or just plain falling in love during the search alone


** There's some good stuff out there, but that's the thing with this kind of story, i'm not sure how many are of actual quality and how many simply satisfy my own wish fulfilment.

Let's start off with these two:

BTW if they turn out to be absolute rubbish then don't come crying to me, I just found them.
