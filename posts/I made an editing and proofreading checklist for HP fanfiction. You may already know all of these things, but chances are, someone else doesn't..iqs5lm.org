The question came up on Discord about editing/proofreading checklists, and I decided I would [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EFEI3vR6JAFJ3mU9rq1FuGKHdxDa2NKgRxH3UO4RWEA/edit#][write mine up in a document]]. I've seen a few of these floating around in the past, so I don't claim to be original or a trend-setter, but writing up my own editing habits was a helpful exercise in codifying, understanding, and then justifying the steps I take when looking over fics (whether my own or someone else's).

Because I read, write, and breathe HP fanfic, this checklist slightly biases toward HP fanfic, but the general spirit of the checklist applies to all writing.

If you are aware of and check for all of these items (or intentionally ignore them because you disagree), great! However, I'm sure there are some out there who aren't aware of these.

I am also, of course, not-so-subtly shilling for my own fic, as I've linked to my author pages in the document.

I'd add:

- Check your tenses. Writing in present tense is +objectively wrong+ fine, if you really want to, but you have to at least be consistent.
- Delete all flashbacks. They are a crutch for bad writing, and you're probably using them wrong anyway.

**** Past tense should be the default, but present tense can be used in combat scenes to give a sense of urgency and action that can't be replicated otherwise. However, that's only a spice, the scene still needs to be well written.

If done correctly, the reader shouldn't even notice the tense change unless pointed out.

***** Not just combat scenes. I rather like it for oneshots that are meant to be tense - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8809533/1/][And the Wolves All Cry]] is a great example of a short story sized fic that's done well in present tense.

That being said... I was always under the impression that it's never appropriate to switch between the two. Are you aware of any examples where it's done correctly?

I find sticking to past tense extremely difficult, and will often shift mid-sentence: "dialogue here," he said, <describe some actions in present>. Needless to say, I reread everything and I'm constantly fixing it. With my current WIP, I just said fuck it and switched everything to present tense, third person limited, because I can keep it consistent and it thankfully suits the style of the story.

**** You can switch in a chapter, just don't switch in the same scene. There are published and successful novels that do this because the chapter has more than one scene and this can also be done with fanfiction.

That being said, if you can stay in one POV in an entire chapter, that is probably the way to go, but if not, switch in the next scene, just try to avoid doing this if you can, especially try to avoid doing it multiple times in the same chapter. It does all depends on the genre of the story and what exactly you are doing, but there is still a general rule. I find that reading either published books, very well-written fanfiction, or google helps whenever I have doubts about how I am writing something.

****** It'll also help if you can create distinct sounding 'voices' for them. Emphasise different things, change your sentence cadence, how events are processed and reacted to, that sort of thing. Really make it clear that you're in the heads of different people.

If you're writing in first person (I'm struggling to parse your comment and can't really tell if you're currently writing first or third) then there's probably a lot of useful information and guides for you in D&D guides on DM roleplaying. When you're one person playing pretty much everybody on an entire planet, you have to work to keep people sounding distinct in ways other than just accents. :)

****** Absolutely. A change of subject should be illustrated, never explicitly stated. If the introduction of the new subject can be executed naturally using elements relevant to the preceding scene, all the better. That way, the reader can comprehend the relation between the two scenes, and the author can avoid jarring or confusing their audience.

Moreover, I don't understand the desire to make scenes and chapters functionally equivalent. Those are two distinct concepts that exist simultaneously for very good reasons: To me, a scene is the narrative of a specific event unfolding from one perspective (change of perspective requires change of scene, even if the same event is retold from a different angle), whereas a chapter is a set of one /or more/ scenes, that together form the narrative of a series of events with distinct, delineated meaning to the story. Sentence < Paragraph < Scene < Chapter < Arc < Story.

If so, then equating a scene with a chapter implies either A) Very boring - and short - chapters, or B) The conflation of several separate events into a single scene. I don't see why either would be desirable.

** There's only one thing i dissagree with. To me, it's the killing curse, Avada Kedavra.

Spell names lower-cased, but incantations upper-cased. I haven't decided on the capitalization item names, to be honest. To me, calming draught is just an item, just like potion is.

Kinda like how I'd capitalize Firebolt, because it's a brand, but wouldn't do the same for broomstick. But I do think that's just preference, and as long as you're consistent, it's fine.

I see that the rule is HP-specific items. But I just find it weird, like it's placing emphasis while it shouldn't.

And I know that JK capitalized Muggle and Muggleborn, and I could squint and see why, but why aren't pureblood and halfblood? It's kinda like albino, white, black, tall. Just designations, descriptions. Why should muggle and muggleborn be capitalized but not the other two?

I'm also undecided on the hyphen in muggleborn, pureblood and halfblood. I know JK does it, and I don't know enough about the rules for hyphenating words, so I can't really say if it's correct or not. It feels like the oxford comma to me. Neither correct nor incorrect, as long as you use it consistently.

For the rest, I agree wholeheartedly. I'm not following them all, I see I'm using some crutches here and there, and I do try to improve.

In the early stages of my writing, I went back and forth on Muggleborn, pureblood, halfblood hyphenation, until I finally looked up one that I think was straight from the book, and then wrote it down in my notes so that I could just reference that instead of, each time I wanted to write it, having to spend 5 minutes trying to remember how I wrote it in the past!

*** Expansion: lists obey the same rules of punctuation as everything else.

You can write a list using complete sentences.

- In lists with complete sentences, each bullet begins with a capital letter and ends with a full stop.

- It's basically a series of completely independent sentences.

Alternatively, you can write a list using commas, exactly the same as if you were writing the list out without the bullet points:

- in lists like this you do not capitalise each bullet,

- but each item must end with a comma or a semi-colon, and

- the final item on the list is preceded with an "and" or an "or" and finishes with a full stop, completing the sentence.

The ultimate rule of lists is this: if you remove the bullets, the resulting prose should still make sense. Bullets are just a formatting tool.

**** That's completely true for formal writing (eg. professional documents), but for casual use it's completely fine to put together a list using sentence fragments. Just make sure your sentence fragments aren't capitalized---as a rule of thumb, capital letter = sentence, which means you need to end it with a period.

A list that's introduced (as in your examples above) generally ends up being more formal.

The real no-no is mixing list styles---don't capitalize bullet points separated by commas (or sentence fragments) and always punctuate points that are full sentences.

Haha, that's a great question. I'm not exactly an authority on this, but in my own experience, it has been a long time since I've read a book with British-style quotes, and a semi-long time since I've read a fanfic with British-style quotes.

I certainly wouldn't stand on my high horse and say "only use American-style quotes," but I know for me it's a lot easier to read double quotes than single quotes in stories. Maybe it's simply because I'm used to it? I think there's also the fact that I might confuse single quotes with apostrophes...

At any rate, I'd pick whatever is more comfortable for you, or what you deem most appropriate for your fic, as long as you are consistent across your fic.

(There's also the whole argument you can get into about "punctuation inside the quotes, American-style" or "punctuation outside the quotes, British-style" but I will withdraw my stick from that particular fire. I've seen people mix double quotes [American] with punctuation outside quotes [British], for example.)
