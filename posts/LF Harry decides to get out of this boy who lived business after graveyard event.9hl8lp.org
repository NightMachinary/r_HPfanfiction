While he was bound to the statue and Voldie was being reborn, Harry rethinks of his life choices, not even focussing on the summoned death eaters. Finally deciding to give on on this hero business, he convincingly fakes being killed by the Voldie and runs away from Wizarding world of Britain. Changing his name and looks, gets back to muggle world to finish his education, hiring private tutors instead of going to other magic schools where he could be tracked, graduating, getting a job, finding few girls to date... I recently rewatched Megamind and I wanna see Harry do the same thing as Metro Man.


** You're dark wizard alright. Just not a Dark lord.

Oh yeah? What's the difference?

Convoluted plans!!!!!

Not sure if this is exactly why you're looking for, but it pretty much has the same premise.

*** But it depends on an incredibly cliche stupid retarded oblivious Harry for pretty much everything.

There is only so much people can take that kind of character without getting absolutely tired of it.

** I could never really get behind those stories with young Harry, because young Harry has skin in the game. Voldemort murdered his loved ones, and that's a major part of Harry's motivation to take him down.

  “Got to?” said Dumbledore. “Of course you've got to! But not because of the prophecy! Because you, yourself, will never rest until you've tried! We both know it! Imagine, please, just for a moment, that you had never heard that prophecy! How would you feel about Voldemort now? Think!”

  Harry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front of him, and thought. He thought of his mother, his father, and Sirius. He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat.

  “I'd want him finished,” said Harry quietly. “And I'd want to do it.” “Of course you would!” cried Dumbledore.

I can totally see older Harry being like MetroMan - tired of all this shit and just looking to spend time with family.

​

tldr; I didn't actually answer your request. I hope you find what you're looking for.

*** In this scene I can easily imagine Hitler in front of Hitler Youth. There're a lot of other adult wizards and witch who were affected by Riddle a lot more than Harry. Yet Dumbledore requires an underaged boy to do the deed an “sure, the Prophecy doesn't matter”.

**** You didn't get the point of this scene.

It's not that "the Prophecy doesn't matter". It's just not the only thing that matters. Harry has to kill Voldemort not because the Prophecy says so. Harry has to kill Vodemort because at this point? He fucking wants to.

Does the Prophecy matter or not?

If it doesn't, why this talk? Why couldn't any other adult wizard do the job? Any of them has more reasons to hate Riddle, because they did fight in the First war. Mad Eye? Molly Weasley who lost brothers? Augusta Longbottom who lost son and daughter-in-law? Other muggleborns who are Riddle's primary targets?Dumbledore himself? Why put such weight on a young boy?

If it does matter, why such lie? “Harry, you have to kill Voldemort, because the Prophesy says so. I'm really sorry, but it's impossible to bypass it”.

****** Prophecy matters. But even if it, by any chance, didn't, Harry would still want to go after Voldemort. That's what Dumbledore is saying here, that Harry is not a pawn of the Prophecy. Even if left to make his own educated choice, Harry would still fight the Death Eaters and their leader.

******* If the Prophesy doesn't matter, than Harry wouldn't be the only one.

Yes, he would fight. As one of many. Such dialog wouldn't be necessary. Harry could make his own decision, likely after finishing Hogwarts. He would fight along dozens of other fighters like him.

In this scene Dumbledore made the decision for Harry. He as an adult manipulated an underaged boy to fight in a war he doesn't want to finish himself because he believes in the Prophesy.

Ignore names for a moment. Consider just a situation when an experienced adult motivates a 15-16 year old boy to kill another human. What would you think about it if you meet it in real life?

******** What? Literally from the beginning of /Order of the Phoenix/, Harry's been eager to join the fight against Voldemort and to want more. If anything, Dumbledore and the order actively hold back from participating, and preferred even in /Deathly Hallows/ (before the fall of the ministry) that he go back to Hogwarts.

15 years old boy. Should I say more?

If it's true, why Harry is the only who Dumbledore told about Horcuxuses to? Why did he make Harry the sole responsible for destroying Riddle?
