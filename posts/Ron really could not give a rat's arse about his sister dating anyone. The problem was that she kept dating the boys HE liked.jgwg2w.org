** Lavender was an unmitigated disaster. It was a farce of a relationship everyone saw through; "just get over yourself and tell Hermione how you feel!" Harry had told Ron succinctly in one of his rare forays into his friends' emotional lives.

Ron had wanted to scream at him: "It's not Hermione I was trying to get over, you pillock!" But a voice which sounded uncannily like his Mum reminded him that screaming at poor ill-socialised and emotionally-neglected Harry was a terrible plan. Especially as he loved him so.

Forget "The Boy Who Lived." Ron had fallen in love the moment Harry had defended him (a boy with few knuts to spare and even fewer connections) against Draco Malfoy, the epitome of wealth and "proper" wizardry. That had told Ron all he needed to know about the skinny boy with broken glasses.

At first, Ron told himself that he was like another brother. A malnourished younger brother who he had to protect, especially when they kept falling into situations involving massive chess sets (seriously, what the hell McGonagall?!) and sabotaging charlatans (double what the hell, Lockhart?!) Waiting behind that cave-in was the worst hour of his life. Telling himself to keep the faith /just for a few more minutes,/ when there was a good chance his only sister and his best friend had been horrifically murdered was pure torture. They're not dead, he kept thinking. Clear the rocks. They'll need a path home. Not dead.

When Ron saw a limping Harry and his pale, shaken sister he was suddenly struck by how he was feeling two different kinds of relief. With Ginny's return, the world felt right again; the sky was up, the ground was down and his only sister was back to pester him to play quidditch with her. With Harry's... It was like Ron suddenly remembered to breathe again. And then Harry had smiled crookedly, a mischievous twinkke emerging from behind his grimy glasses. Ron knew. He was in love. The phrase seemed too small to hold his feelings, but he didn't know how else to express it. So he found other ways.

Like backing Harry in a stupid argument over the Firebolt. Like throwing himself between him and a suspected mass murderer, forget the broken leg. Like getting insanely worried when Harry was entered into the Triwizard Tournament and working himself up to the point that he had convinced himself that Harry must have done /something/ and being so, so very angry that he would do that to everyone around him. Everytime Harry looked hurt, Ron stamped down on the voice saying he should apologise and kept his anger fed with imagined scenes of Harry and Viktor flipping Krum keeping each other /company./ Two handsome young wizards. Both seekers. Both wise and talented beyond their years... Why wouldn't they? Better him than a lanky, mediocre nobody.

One dragon later and love made Ron Weasley humble again. Who cares what and who Harry does? Just as long as he's alive and happy, Ron will be too. He renews his devotion by attending that ghastly ball with a girl who's clever enough to see /which/ champion pair he's glaring at. She is not kind about it.

Through the trauma, grief and anger of the next year, Ron does not waver - even in the face of Cho Chang. (He won't lie, he's quite glad when /that/ goes up in a ball of emotional flames). He stands by Harry. By Sixth Year the idea that he and Harry will never be together is almost cozy - until it isn't.

It starts small. Harry's eyes seek out Ginny first in the room. He begins to awkwardly change the subject anytime Ron brings her up. He sodding /blushes/ after staring at her a little too long after practice. And Ron can't. He just can't. Looking at them, he sees a future full of children and sunshine... And sad, lonely Uncle Ron who never moved on from the crush he had as a teenager. Looking at those two pussyfoot around each other is like breathing in powdered glass.

He asks Hermione out first. She knows damn well what he's doing and she is not here for it. She has too much dignity to be anybody's rebound, particularly when the idiots in question ought to just kiss and be done with it. It's why she and Ron don't speak again until March.

Then they win the Cup. Ron was so happy. Harry came in and his face blossomed into a smile he hadn't seen in so long and his happiness seemed complete. Then Harry's face took on the kind of intensity that Ron had seen in so many dreams, so many fantasies, and for a moment he allowed himself to hope. It was /him/ he was striding towards! Any moment now he would...

... Gather Ginny up into his arms and snog her senseless in front of the whole Common Room. Ron almost /feels/ his chest collapse in on itself. He forces himself to nod in approval, even as his knuckles turn white with how hard he's gripping the trophy.

"Oh Ron..." Hermione's face is so full of compassion it hurts, as the rest of Gryffindor ignore him in light of the latest gossip. She hugs him as his body begins to be wracked by sobs.

"It hurts! Why does it hurt?"

She holds him tighter.

*** THE CONCLUSION 1/2 BECAUSE WORD LIMITS

Wearing a horcrux is pure hell for Ron Weasley. It's even worse than watching the man he loves cavort with his sister and pretending to be happy about it; he should know, he did that. He knows Harry thinks its because he's too used to hot meals and feather beds, but Hermione is too and she manages to cope. Ron tries not to think too hard about how easily starvation and privation come to Harry, but murderous anger at those Muggles adds itself to the toxic chorus that sings in his ear everytime he wears that locket. All too easily he could understand where You-Know-Who was coming from now, and it terrifies him.

Every day he listened to the voices telling him he was stupid. Worthless. Unloved. Unlovable. As greedy for affection as for food. Grab another chicken leg Ron! Your sister might steal it out from under your nose! Why would Harry choose you? When he could have your beautiful, sycophantic sister? (A small part of him knows that's unfair. Ginny dropped the hero worship ages ago). /She/ loved the Boy Who Lived, he only loved Harry. Why couldn't Harry see that? Why was Harry so bloody dense?! Had that Muggle filth damaged him so badly he couldn't see love when it stood by him for /seven sodding years/?!

Ron barely remembers exactly what he said to Harry when he eventually snapped. He just knows it was ugly. Like the chess player he still is at heart, he struck all of Harry's weaknesses with clinical precision: Doesn't know what he's doing? Check. Blind faith in a dead man's half-arsed plan? Check. Doesn't really care about Ron's family? Check. How could he? It's not like he's ever had a real family, he just borrowed Ron's when it suited him: Double check.

By the time Ron reached Shell Cottage, he convinced himself that he had destroyed his friendship along with any chance of saving Wizarding Britain. All because Ron Weasley couldn't deal with his insane jealousy for one more day. Bill never asked him what happened and he's grateful. He keeps his head down and helps around the Cottage, aware he's - well - a /shell/ of himself. It was Fleur that brought him to his senses.

"'Ow long 'ave you loved 'Arry?" She asked him abruptly. He nearly peeled his knuckles off as he fumbled with the potato he was holding.

"Who says I do?"

"Pfft... Please, Ronald. Your reaction to me 'as always been /un peu exagérée/ - especially when 'Arry is there. You 'ave been 'ere for days and you 'ave not ogled me once! Ergo, you 'ave stopped lying to yourself - but the one you wish to lie to is not 'ere. I suppose I should feel insulted..." Her cheeky grin puts him at ease and says she is anything but.

It's like he's seeing Fleur clearly for the first time. Beyond the beauty and the /Frenchness/ she wears like armour. She is kind, clever and every inch the brilliant Champion of Beauxbatons.

"Since the very first day we met..." He confides quietly. Fleur opens a bottle of red and pushes a glass towards him.

It's cathartic to finally say it all out loud. Hermione had always /known/, but she had never asked. Why would she when she'd had a ringside seat for the last seven years? Fleur knows exactly when to ask questions and exactly when to let Ron speak. By the time the bottle's finished he has sworn to himself that if he ever sees his Mum, Ginny and Hermione again, then he is going to tell them all to back the hell off and give her a proper chance.

"Ron..." Fleur said hesitantly. "I don't want to give you false 'ope, but I think you should 'ave all the facts before you decide you are going to die alone and unloved. You remember that I was a Triwizard Champion? Well, I was sat near 'Arry for the 'ole of the Yule dinner and 'e paid no attention to 'is partenaire for the evening."

"Yeah, he had a thing for Cho - Cedric's girlfriend."

"Mmm, well. To me it looked like 'e also 'ad "a thing" for the other 'Ogwarts Champion. Cedric. I know Viktor thought so too." With that nonchalant pronouncement, the axis of Ron's world wheels around and changes.

"What? But he never -"

"Because you 'ave been so open yourself? Besides 'Arry may not 'ave known 'imself... 'E was only fourteen. I think we all forget that..." Fleur's eyes sharpened. "Ron. Even if 'Arry loves men as well as women, you must remember that 'e might not love you. And you must accept this."

And he does. But he can't quite smother the small, bright spark of hope in his chest. It's enough for him to keep his bags packed and to be ready to roll out when the Deluminator shows him the way.

He rescued Harry from the bottom of the lake because of /course/ the dolt had to go full Lady of the Lake in the middle of winter. Wearing a murderous, evil piece of twisted soul. He gave Harry hell for that when he was safe, but he can't stop smiling. And neither can Harry.

Destroying the horcrux is a special level of horrifying for Ron as his deepest insecurities play out as a grotesque pantomime. Even for someone as emotionally dense as Harry, it was obvious. Ron took a deep breath:

"I love you. I always have. I - I don't want anything from you. I know that it's kind of up in the air between you and Ginny and you might not even... And I still want to be your friend. If you'll have me. If you want me to go away, I will. But please don't hate me. I've done horrible, terrible things to you and Hermione, but please don't hate me for this."

Harry takes a hesitant step forward and throws his arms around his best friend.

"I could never hate you."

Hermione punches him. He deserved that. She also hugs him. He's not sure he deserved that. If he catches Harry looking at him with a peculiar calculating glint, he tries not to read anything into it.

**** CONCLUSION 2/2 BECAUSE WORD LIMITS

Voldemort leads a procession of Death Eaters into Hogwarts. At its head is a weeping Hagrid holding a limp figure who looks like...

"HARRY! NO!" The scream torn from Ron's lips sounds like someone else's, but the pain? The pain is all his.

The battle which follows is a confusing mess of violence, hope and magic. The fact that Harry is alive spurs Ron to fight, even if a part of him doesn't quite believe it until he's stood in front of Voldemort and goading him into single combat.

He watches Harry - clever, confident and seemingly invincible in the face of death - and even with his heart in his throat, he knows that everyone finally sees the Harry he does. And he is terrifying in his beauty. Ron holds his breath as Voldemort is thrown backwards. He follows the arc of the Elder Wand through the air and only breathes again when Harry catches it. Without looking. Smug bastard.

The aftermath is quieter than Ron thought it would be. He always imagined parties and fireworks when he thought about the end of the war. Like a post-Quidditch party, but better. Instead there are trials, soul-searching. Funerals. Fred's funeral.

After the funeral, Ron quietly packs his bags and George's and takes him to Shell Cottage. They all need to recover. And that will happen a lot faster without Mum accidentally calling George by his dead twin's name. The weeping that follows and watching George retreat further inside himself breaks everyone's hearts anew everytime it happens.

With the change of scenery, George begins to open up a little. Fleur refuses to let him be lazy. Ron enlists the help of Lee Jordan to run Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes and he pops by every couple of days to update George, cheerily disregarding the fact that he hadn't spoken since the funeral. Eventually Harry shows up with his bags and sheepishly explains that he and Ginny broke it off for good and staying at The Burrow wasn't a good look diplomatically right now.

"It was perfectly friendly." Harry explains on the beach one day. "We just had a very different experience of the last few months of the War. I don't think she ever forgave me for not taking her along. And that's fair. She can't quite get what we went through, and honestly I don't think I'll ever truly understand what her and Neville went through at Hogwarts. We don't want the same things anymore."

"What did she want?"

"To live life to its fullest." Harry sighed. "She wants to become a star seeker, fulfill every dream she ever had. She's seen death and it's scared her into seeking excitement, because life is short."

"And you? Still want to be an Auror?"

"Don't know. I /died,/ Ron." He admitted quietly. "I've fought every day of my life since Voldemort killed my parents. I want to stop. I want... I want a cottage. I want serenity. I want... I want to be happy. Is that selfish?" His green eyes fill with tears. Ron rubs his shoulder in an awkward show of comfort.

"Nah. S'only sensible. Here's one thing I don't get: If you and Ginny had such a good break-up, why are you here?"

Harry looked embarrassed:

"Yeah, let's just say your Mum didn't take it very well. And if she tried to lock us in the chicken coop again, then I'm pretty sure Ginny was going to hex her."

Ron laughed before updating him on Hermione's search for her parents. Apparently Viktor Krum had volunteered to help...

Harry shows up at Shell Cottage with Teddy Lupin not long after. He plonked the toddler on George's lap on the beach and steps back.

"I have an idea. Trust me." He whispered to Ron as he supervised from afar.

Teddy stared up at George. First he burgled. Then he turned his hair red. When that didn't get a reaction, he screamed. One does not simply ignore a toddler. George winced and almost dropped him in shock.

"What's up with you, little man? Don't like boring old George?" His voice is hoarse from lack of use. "Gimme a sec." Within a few seconds, George had a stream of rainbow bubbles coming out of his wand - much to Teddy's delight.

Ron gaped. Harry grinned, like he knew it would work out. It was very difficult not to jump him right there and then. So imagine Ron's surprise, when Harry grabbed his jumper and pulled his lips down onto his. Throughout the kiss, he can feel Harry's smile pressed against his.

"Oh thank fuck for that." They broke apart in a panic, only to see a very amused Hermione Granger standing next to a Viktor Krum who's eyebrows have disappeared somewhere into his hairline. "Sorry," she apologised sheepishly, "but you have /no idea/ how long you've both needed to do that for!"

Xxxxxxx

Professor Potter and Mr Weasley are perfectly happy, thank you very much. They have a cottage in Hogsmeade and two beautiful children they love very much. They have tea with Professor Hagrid every Friday, who cried like a baby when he had been told that their first child would be named Ruby after him. Their second, Colin, will be joining Hogwarts next year. Ruby wants him to be a Hufflepuff like her, but Harry has a sneaking suspicion that he'll be in Slytherin. And that's okay.

Mr Weasley manages the Hogsmeade branch of WWW and wouldn't have it any other way. Besides, he can embarrass Ruby in front of her friends when she comes in.

Yes. All is well.

****** Thank you! That's a serious compliment there.

The canon names never really sat right with me, and I feel like Harry won some serious rock paper scissors to name all three kids after dead people he mostly only knew somewhat properly after they died. Hagrid and Colin need more love. Also Hagrid never traumatised 3/4 of the students he taught, so there's that?

I like to think Teddy always had a place with Uncle George. Harry was probably the responsible one, so I feel like George would delight in sneaking him joke products and taking him to Quidditch matches.

********* Yup. Threw me for a wringer. Not fluent in Latin, I can read it. Only when I've had enough food, sleep, and water, though. When not, it's usually just a rough estimate of what it approximately says. My method when I can't apply the knowledge I actually studied for? Look for words that are generally constant. Also look for words that are commonly known and used frequently in the language which you are translating (eg. non, ego, etc.). Watch for grammar words(can't remember what they're called, but stuff like el, de, etc.) and note them, that'll help with understanding what the fuck it says, instead of just seeing random words. Look for context and grammar, with a lot of languages---Latin especially---words change meanings, turning into what we generally call ‘synonyms', especially when you're going to English. Another thing to note, many words in the English language are taken from other languages. So having an extensive knowledge of the language is a definite plus, which helps a lot. Add it all together, edit a bit, and you have your translation.

I have a...let's call it analytical mind.

** The love for Dean grew slowly over the course of several years. It was a distant love, for they never grew close enough - at least not until the Triwizard Disaster - and it dissipated after Dean kissed his sister. /Bloody cheater/. Michael boot was next, as he wanted to see if he liked boys ‘that way' but they mutually broke up in the end after agreeing it didn't work for them. It took several close-to-death adventures before he /finally/ realized it was /Harry/ he was in love with, with a deep and powerful love, something like a river or a tornado, he thought, before being uncomfortably reminded of Ginny's god awful poem in their second year. But Harry wouldn't want him that way. It made the Horcrux worse, somehow, taunting him with what could never be, making Harry seem nonchalant and uncaring to his loyal friends, making Ron feel stupid and hopeless for not having figured out the brilliant Plan Dumbledore must've told Harry (...right? There must've been a plan, Dumbledore just had Harry sworn to secrecy like he so often had), culminating in him lashing out and leaving. /Leaving the two lovebirds alone together/, the Horcrux would've told him snidely, although he /knew/ Harry was in love with Ginny, not Hermione.

Whereas Harry's character as a female could be fascinating. Girls occasionally respond to things differently that boys, and how the Dursley's treated her would be different as well. I love fem!Harry, and if I was in her place I would've fallen in love with my best friend which is why I enjoy shopping her with Ron. I also love when her and Ron have a strong sibling like relationship though (whether Harry is male or female). There aren't enough fem!Harry/Ron fics out there and most that exist are rather short.
