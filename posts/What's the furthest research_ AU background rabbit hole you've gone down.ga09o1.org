I'm currently writing a fic that involves a lot of quidditch, and I spent four hours and 5k words creating quidditch leagues for parts of Europe not mentioned in the books. I've names them all, given them mascots, and created background lore and rivalry. I might have to drop it as a bonus chapter because the amount of work for a few paragraphs of mention spiraled out of control.


** As background work for a fic I have been writing for a while, I've written about 30 pages of a textbook about the Dark Arts, most of which is a history of them.

I still have about 2/3 of the textbook unfinished, and the actual fic only has about ten chapters written. I don't like releasing until I've finished (as I never finish stories if I do, and I don't want people to read a story just to get upset that it's abandoned).

**** Yeah, I started doing it because when I would release a few chapters and then lose interest or get stuck, and then see comments from people asking when a new chapter was coming, I would feel really guilty, and I'd try to force myself to write more, but that just made me hate writing, and you can't write well if you don't enjoy the writing, so... I just stopped releasing unfinished work.

** Background for a story set at Ilvermorny in the 60s, with their version of the civil rights movement. Let's see here:

- I made a bad computer sketch of the school grounds (honestly, if I had a piece of paper and a ruler i could do it np but make me use a computer and it's baffling how bad I am at it)

- A course calendar for the school, including offered subjects and masteries, example timetables, course lists for younger students (pre-electives), redid the OWL/NEWT system, figured out how to make quiddich leagues and so on that actually made sense (also quodpot because that's more popular? I guess?), and durrrrr. Graduation requirements. What an apprentice at the school would do. And more. It's a really, really big document.

- Determined the feeder countries for the schools, using different boundaries than muggle/no-maj. Puerto Rico is not part of the USA. The island of Hispaniola is not two countries. Texas is not completely American. Canada is split in three (Acadia, Canada, Athabaskan Territories). And so on.

- Outlined a list of MACUSA departments, including naming section heads

- Figured out the approximate student population of Ilvermorny, realized that they'd need to sort several hundred students every year and then decided that ilvermorny needed a week 0 / frosh week kind of thing just to deal with it because it would be a dawn til dusk and beyond thing otherwise.

- Wrote out a curriculum for the subject the MC is teaching

- Cross referenced way too many things to create a timeline for desegregation in the USA, including which posh ones were still segregated in what year (because I needed that information for one of my little asshole characters, that's why!)

- Also created a timeline for the first wizarding war because reasons. I made a bunch of crap up and I'm okay with that.

- Read literal journal articles about desegregation, historically black schools, [[https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7709/jnegroeducation.81.1.0082][PoC teaching in white schools]], and so much more. Did you know that there's a Journal of Negro Education? Because there is and it's a goldmine even if the articles occasionally made me want to throw things.

** From one perspective... I was trying to figure out how (a) James Potter is a pureblood and (b) Harry has no relatives. That's about 2000 words because of the way I did it (bear with and I'll find an easy way of showing this). [[https://medium.com/@ournewera.oo/sort-of-a-harry-potter-fanfic-4327e9e0a821][Voila.]]

From another perspective... I was trying to figure out how tall characters could plausibly be. The code got a bit wonky because the heights don't quite line up generation to generation, but it makes sense enough. I'm not sure how long this took in the end but it was long enough I can't be arsed going back to figure out where things went wrong.

- I decided that there would have to be some pretty distant cousins (but, honestly, a lot of people don't even seem to consider second cousins part of the family)
- James is not the only example of long generational lead time in the family
- effectively, they just marry families that have come down to the last relative

**** Probably bad luck, really (if we're going with the in-universe explanation). We don't really see inheritance issues in canon, so that'd be an entirely fanon interpretation (not that it's bad). For magical lifespans, it's stated to be longer - but the way most wizards/witches act, it almost seems like a normal human timespan for it (everyone getting married early, for instance).

So, really it's narrative fiat - but it's not /that/ unrealistic for both his grandparents to have been single children, having married late, and had James at a consequentially late time in their lives - making it so that that side of the family is sparse.

** I've built a few nations based on local mythology and how it might be possible through the HP magic system.

For example, I designed a complex systems of courts and nobility that is ascended mainly through non-violent political maneuvering, based on the old, old pre-german, pre-emperor europe that's now part of germany, all of which runs concurrently to the official magical government of germany, the "Kanzlei der Magie", which advised the emperor of the holy roman empire in matters of magical nature, but whose position wasn't abolished with the destruction of that empire. In essence, the entirety of europe looks completely different on the magical side, which still adheres to a parallel version of the continent as it looked pre-SoS. The capital is located deep in the Black Forest, whose true extent is hidden from muggle eyes.

Magical Rome forms the capital of magical society for much of the earth, being the birthplace of modern magical practices, and having submerged underneath the city into a system of caverns, catacombs, hollows and palaces beneath the entire city when the city fell. All new ruins discovered beneath modern rome are structures whose repelling charms have died, with the denizens moving deeper and deeper as the muggles dig from above. This is a major cause for the wizard-goblin relations being so sour, as the goblins were granted territory underneath rome when the empire was still new in exchange for superior metalworking that equipped the roman legions. The empire plundered and stole and aquired as much knowledge as possible, magical and mundane, most of which is now hidden in "true rome", as the wizards call it today. One of the few access points is the vatican library, whose deeper portions have a direct connection to the undercity.

** I've not gone so far as some people in this thread. The worst I've done was spend a couple hours looking up common class sizes and lengths for private schools in Britain, as well as number of classes taught per teacher in a week. I did this to generate timetables for the named professors of Hogwarts. I did that to see how many students Hogwarts could feasibly support based on canon teaching notes and the research, how big of a population that number of youth would support, and how many other youth there could feasibly be in other education systems. And I did the whole thing, not for my own fic, but for a response to a reddit post discussing Magical Britain and Hogwarts populations.

‚Äã

I've also done hours of research regarding the occult/mysticism/supernatural/religion of various regions in order take inspiration from them to write an in universe textbook that highlights different magical methodologies around the world and how they evolved. This also devolved into magical histories for various magical cultures, namely the Romans, Greek, British, and Nords.

I've also done research for and written a couple of essay type background things on magical food webs, which include the positioning of Magical Plants, Magical creatures as both consumers and producers, as well as Emotion and Magic as basic energy sources fed on by some creatures. Which turned into a couple of pieces about the biology and habits of AU versions of Dementors and Boggarts. ( I must say I'm pretty happy with my version of dementors and hope I find a good place to actually use it)

I've done a ton of research on spell categories as described in the books, both the categories and each spell specified to belong to those categories. They are very inconsistent. (Look no further than jinxes as minor hexes vs jinxes as eye contact required muttering). By separating the spells by effect and description I built a system where there were three different naming schemes for describing spells and any given spell will use a different scheme based on who and when they created it.

****** I write about Harry Potter the way I think it should be. Most of that is canon compliant, but not all. Most of the common magic history/theory I wrote is based on my understanding of general applications of mysticism throughout the world, while specifics are more for each region. I think it is a highly Anglo-Roman centric view that Runes are only a writing system. Wands and spells and rituals might be the basis of how we think of magic, but Nordic mysticism as we know of it was steeped in Runes for enchanting, blessing, warding off danger, and foretelling the future. In my opinion it is far less likely that a magic school would teach a historical magical methodology as a foreign language elective and that the Runes themselves hold no power than that they are actually useful.

**** That's the standard advice - do the research, use it to inform the writing, but never let the reader see it. I've seen a fair number of fanfictions that violate that, quite often to the detriment of the story, but I can understand an author wanting to show off just how much effort they put into things.

That's actually why Frank Herbert put the research he did for "Dune" into the appendices. He'd done all this research and thought into ecology, religion, and politics, and wanted to get some benefit from it (paid by the word?).

**** The thing I loved most about the 70s (in the UK at least) is the rise of rock music. Black Sabbath came out with their first album in 1970 for example. Then there are also artists who started in the 60s like David Bowie and Thin Lizzy but went global in the 70s. The 60s and 70s have a lot of overlap in that sense.

I wrote a lot about the Marauders time and I like the idea of, especially Sirius, being really into that rock stuff. :)

Also all the familial technical terms and how much I can find on who is related to who. Because with all the inbreeding and whatnot I wanted to know whether it was possible to ship people or not. I'm not making a repeat of how stupid it is to marry your second cousin(coughOrionandWalburgacough).

I also did a bunch of research for genetics and stuff cause I had some oc characters at the time and wanted to know which traits to highlight for a character.

Also how some court systems worked and how I could integrate it for wizengammot meetings cause the fic Did You Know? Or at least I think that's the title gave me a very good idea and wanted to see how the trial for Sirius could have gotten more interesting if he had one.

Academy level, Duelist level, Skirmish level, Siege level and finally Lord level, which one has to create themselves to be called lord of magic. Dark lord or Light lord whatever. Upto siege level you can learn from books and such, but lord level has to be personal. Mostly an enhanced version of siege level spells. Hogwarts teaches academy level till OWLs and Duelist level till NEWTs. Mastery or Auror training standard is Skirmish level. Siege level spells are usually for the very skilled people like senior Aurors or the ones we know as badass, like Hogwarts teachers. But Hogwarts has books on upto siege level in restricted section and harry will most likely learn them. As an example Patronus is a Skirmish level spell.

It will have heavily quidditch focused chapters (especially before, during and after the quidditch world cup) and my main plot during the books will be her playing for her house team and being team captain. I don't want to disappoint you if you're looking for a post-war, pro quidditch fic (tho I might write one later). I think what I'm trying to say in this ramble is that quidditch will be important in terms of my oc's character development. She will not be part of the golden trio, thus to have some plot, I will focus on the inter house quidditch cup. Ex: how the games are, how the OC grows, makes friends, etc because of quidditch.

** For me, currently I'm writing a fantasy epic Hsrry Potter fic...

Like Skyrim.

Basically the plot so far is that after Dumbledore and Grindelwald fought the last time, it created a magical backlash that took over all of Europe and is a blackout.

No Electronics, nobody can leave and no one can enter.

This caused massive amounts of riots, and witch hunts and a war until a hero from Eastern Europe highly suspected to be from Alabnia does a peace treaty and new states are made.

The UK, Spain, Portugal, France and Belgium all are one government, but each country has a mini one. Based of the State system in the US. Magic is banned here, any use of it is punished severely. Called Raymere (I know). At the beginning set here for the most part.

Second Centeral Europe is Magical kind only, however no formal government. Just multiple bodies of creatures and wizards and witches. Lots of crime. Called Weilstadt and is heavily influenced by TES Skyrim and Oblivion.

Third is Eastern Europe, and bu that I mean Albania, Kosovo, Greece, Italy and the rest of the Balkans. This is the only democratic place. Called Vel√∂ and is very important for story reasons, and becuase it's the one me and my cousin put a lot of thought into as our parents come from Albania.

However every year, in an effort to decrease tensions between the three countries Weilstadt holds a tournament between the three countries. One delegate from the three participates in the Triwizard Tournament. Raymere never sends one as Magic is outlawed and such.

Revolves around Harry Potter, he has no magic and lives with his aunt and uncle who are too protective of him. Says if he sees magic to runaway. He lives in a villiage in Raymere, it used to be a city up north used as a port but not anymore.

You see after the Blackout, magic works differently, anyone around magic is susceptible to gain and keep it. No more muggleborns, and pure bloods jumbo. But, gaining it can lead to rejection by the body and that leads to death.

Then one day a dragon attacks his town and only 2 people survive, Harry and the exchange student from London Hermione. They both get magic and have to run away from the people hunting them, trying to get rid if their magic, something about a Prophecy and a Dark Cult led by a mysterious Lord Voldemort. And who is the hero that ended the war, and is Dumbledore alive?

Find out soon.

When I'm finished writing at least half of it.

I put a lot of thought into this, and I'm actually co writing this with my cousin on ffn. Hes called Tydbox if anyone wants to know.

We put a lot of thought into the world an little details, clearly a Massive AU kinda inspired by Prince of the Dark Kingdom.

Also there is plenty of more lore... we have a full on word document that has 30k words on just the lore, 10k describing the story to the very end and includes some scenes and dialogue and fight scenes.

Hopefully first chapter will realese soon, especially beciase of quarantine and exams being cancelled for me and my cousin.

First chapter is planned to be 15k at least.

******** Ah, it was decades ago, and I didn't know him.

But yes, my point is that while it was a tragedy for the family, on a national scale people just took it as how things were and how sports were supposed to work. Measures have been taken to make rugby safer over the decades, but all of them had to overcome strong arguments from people who thought they spoiled the game. /Quidditch through the Ages/ does some light poking fun at that sort of thing.

***** imo a good way to maintain the original charm and make it make a bit more sense is to do the following:

- Bludgers are enchanted to be soft enough to only break bone when hitting a really bad spot (like your fingers, or your toes), and they never aim for the head. Same with the floor, which has a cushioning charm on it

- The snitch favors the team with the least amount of points, and catching it only awards 50 instead of 150 points. It also doesn't end the game in any way, a new one is released if the old one is caught. This way, it would be an equalizer instead of an "i win" button.

- Games last for 5 hours maximum, but end when one side has 500 points otherwise.

***** What about there is a 90 minute time limit to the game, ended sooner if the snitch is caught (but the snitch is worth less points than in the books). Quaffles are worth more points. Bludgers don't exist, the beaters are more of a defender- they can't touch quaffles within a certain distance from the goals, but can certainly pass them up to the chasers and provide extra bodies in front of the keeper. I'm thinking about having different rules for different leagues if I focus more on the quidditch side of things.

****** There was a story (and it was one of those ‚ÄúHarry got saved from some-trouble by somebody and brought up by Andromeda Tonks as a member of the Black family‚Äù), where they had completely different set of rules. I don't remember exactly, but I think they did nothing about the Bludgers, but there was no separate position of Seeker, just when a Chaser scored some amount of points, she can Seek and when catching the Snitch (which was then released again, no ending of game) got some higher number of points (fifty?). Not sure when the game ended but something more predictable.

If somebody knows what the story it was, please, let me know.
