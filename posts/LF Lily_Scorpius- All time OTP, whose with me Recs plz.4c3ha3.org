I feel as if I have read every piece of scorily fanfiction to be easily found- and am nowhere near satisfied! Any recs would be appreciated. And Scorily does not need to be the main point of the story, just somewhere in there would be great :)

Side note: still stuns me that this is not a more popular pairing. Is this just me or are their other Scorily shippers out there desperate for good fanfics? Just curious.


** A bit new to this pairing, so I would be interested in anything you have, so what is the good, quality stuff of +scorlily+/liscor/lilypius (because Malfoy would not wear the pants) that you have, please.
