:END:
For the past couple days I've had this one shot fic in my mind, but I just can't find it. Post-Hogwarts, female Harry is looking to get married, but she hasn't had any luck, can't remember why, so she puts out an official courtship request or something, to say that she is accepting courtship proposals. The applications are sorted by her aunt? Or something - it might have been Andromeda Tonks. Harry is not allowed to know who's applying, she's just asked a series of questions and Andromeda decides. That's not a major part. The guy who's picked is Barty Crouch Jr. Interesting points that might help identify; James Potter is alive and does not approve of Barty. I remember there being some insults thrown about. Barty has bought a house in Hogsmeade for the two of them to live in together. When Harry and Barty are first undressing to go to bed, she comments on how attractive she finds a man in socks and nothing else. This was a serious fic, not crack, despite the socks thing. To anyone who knows, I thank you in advance, it's been driving me crazy!


** Well there's a combination I've never seen.
