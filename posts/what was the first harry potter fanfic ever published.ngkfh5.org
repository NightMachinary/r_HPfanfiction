** on FFNet, it appears to be linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3803/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Man-of-Unknown][Harry Potter and the Man of Unknown]]), which takes ID 3803 and was published over 21 years ago on Sep 4th 1999.

Interesting, despite being published later, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/684/1/Lily][Lily]] by Katie Bell) has an ID of 684, and was published in October 1999.

And, finally, as far as I can tell, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4/]] is the oldest (still uploaded) story on FFNet, and is for the X-Files.

Beyond that, no clue as for any of the other various sites where fic gets posted.

** There used to be various forums where people would post their stories/ideas for the next books so probably on one of those. Sadly I think all of them are gone.

** I don't think you'd be able to find it as they were mostly posts on forums/geocities sites in the early days. The first one I read was about a month after PoA's release and it had Harry in year 4. Voldemort was still a wraith antagonist although the author correctly predicted Wormtail was attempting to resurrect him (that story ended with Wormtail's failure though) and Sirius's name got cleared.
