Harry gets sorted into Hufflepuff and becomes friends with other first year Hufflepuffs. When he finds out about the reputation of Hufflepuffs as duffers, he talks to his friends and they determinedly decide to prove to everyone that Hufflepuffs aren't duffers. But unfortunately they are in fact, duffers, and keep bumbling things up.

- In first year they suspect that Professor Snape is trying to steal Dumbledore's hair care potion to use it on his terrible hair, so they try to stop it, and in the process they cause Voldemort to almost get the stone.

- In second year the group of heroic Hufflepuffs try to find the chamber and defeat the evil heir of Slytherin. In a series of misunderstandings they believe that Filch is the heir of Slytherin and his monster is an enchanted goat. Again with their clumsy nosing around they almost bring disaster on the school.

- In third year they are convinced that Sirius Black has entered Hogwarts as a bush, and is trying to kidnap Ron Weasley and train him as an assassin for his evil purposes. They keep "guarding" Ron, annoying him to no end and keep capturing bushes because they think the bushes are Black in disguise.

- And so on.

** so, some ideas I had for this prompt.

year 1: while trying to stop Snape from stealing Dumbledore's hair potion, Quirrel (who doesn't really exist is just Voldemort in disguise) tries to steal the philosopher's stone, but Harry and the duffers don't give a damn and think he's just a well intentioned fellow with low social interaction skills. In the end Voldemort gets the stone and creates a new body for himself, an older version of Tom Riddle (being a half-serpent noseless monster didn't do him any good)

Year 2: they are absolutely sure that Filch is the heir of Slytherin, and is petrifying the students because he is angry about being an squib. Snooping around, they screw up everything because Tom Riddle's diary manages to own a body (possibly Ginny Weasley or someone quite unexpected to be Voldemort like Lavander Brown), and runs away from school with the basilisk. . no one dies but Hermione becomes a statue and they eventually talk to her.

Year 3: they pursue Sirius relentlessly, who is actually not trying to hide because he wants to talk to Harry. They achieve the enmity of all Weasleys by claiming that Ron is allied with Sirius (and Voldemort by extension). Peter Pettigrew also manages to escape because they think Scabbers is a magical rat who can turns into a human. In the end Voldemort releases all the Death Eaters from Azkaban and everyone Just panic thinking that Sirius Black's escape was just a presage of what's to come

** It would be amusing if they ended up saving the day each time by total accident/bumbling. Kinda get smart/the man with one red shoe esque. So they would be totally off on their beliefs of what was going on, but others would think they knew more than they did, or would misconstrue their words/actions. So they save the day without even knowing what was really going on. Some of the time they find out what was really happening afterwards, and some of the time they are left in blissful ignorance while death eaters are left cursing their names.

They continuously try and 'out' her(imagine like throwing holy water at a Vampire) by using tried and true 'methods' from books in the Library(which they somehow didn't realise was complete fiction).
- In fifth year they are convinced Umbridge is hiding a Horcrux(because they apparently found out earlier) in her cat plates.
- In sixth year they, being kind Hufflepuffs, are concerned about Draco and help him.
- Draco and Harry get together. The war ends. Everyone is happy except...

****** Why? Despise is quite a strong word to use against a 17 year old boy.

Like, people always claim they 'despise' him or another one(I think someone once said something about...Lavender? I don't know, some other minor-ish character) but all their reasons are A) complete shit and B) something that was rebutted by the author(and then they also claim I was doing acrobatics to try and defend him, and was completely disregarding canon).

So why do you not like him? And what does you 'despising him' entail, exactly(ie. what's the extent your hatred, what do you feel exactly, in regards to some of the generally brought up points in this particular debate).

Completely unrelated, but you don't have to like a character to enjoy a ship. I personally dislike Dumbledore, but I totally ship him with Geralt and would /totally/ read some ff about them - they're the wicked power couple.

I don't really care about Draco all that much, but that's blatantly false. A character who uses slurs, wishes death on their classmates, abuses his power (both as a prefect and as an Inquistorial Squad member), almost kills two of his classmate, silently watches while someone was getting tortured by their aunt, and tries to kill Harry to curry favor with Voldemort /should/ be called out for their actions, and it's perfectly reasonable to hate Draco because of all of that.

Addressing your second point, I don't really know what you're talking about. JK Rowling has never defended Draco in any interview (that I know of, at least), but she /has/ talked about how Draco shouldn't be so glorified:

#+begin_quote
  "For all this, Draco remains a person of dubious morality in the seven published books, and I have often had cause to remark on how unnerved I have been by the number of girls who fell for this particular fictional character (although I do not discount the appeal of Tom Felton, who plays Draco brilliantly in the films and, ironically, is about the nicest person you could meet). Draco has all the dark glamour of the anti-hero; girls are very apt to romanticise such people. All of this left me in the unenviable position of pouring cold common sense on ardent readers' daydreams as I told them, rather severely, that Draco was not concealing a heart of gold under all that sneering and prejudice and that no, he and Harry were not destined to end up best friends."

******* I really don't have the energy to get into a long, drawn out argument about Malfoy, so I just post this one comment in reply to yours.

I hate Malfoy because he was a bully and a magical little Nazi. He thought a monster attacking and killing innocent kids was cool and exciting. He tried to encourage Harry to go after Sirius in the hope that he would get killed doing it. He became a death eater pretty much by his own choice in the age of 16. He put the owner of Three Broomsticks under emperius for a whole year. He brought death eaters into the school. And he tried to capture Harry for Voldemort.

It's you people who like the idiot who need to give reasons for liking him, because hating him is very easy and natural.

It /is/ highly dependent of the authors, specially for minor characters like Colin, Terry Boot, Astoria, Su Li or Justin Flinch-Fletcher (all of whom I ship with Harry despite not really caring for either Su Li or Justin otherwise) but some characters just kind of... fit for a lack of a better term.
