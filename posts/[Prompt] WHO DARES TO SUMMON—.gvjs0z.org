The Dursley's are desperate to get rid of Harry. They can't go the normal way, the freaks will stop them, so they need to dabble in a bit of magic themselves, if only to protect their precious Dudley.

They draw up a circle, throw down some random symbols, and put a big pentagram in the middle. They've seen enough movies to know how to summon demons. That's all there is to it right?

Cue the chanting, and the candles, and the sacrificial chicken. They will get the demon to get rid of Harry, or even better, sacrifice him to the demon in exchange for money and power. “Astrum splendidum, vos invoco. Vos invoco ut faciatis voluntatem meam. Dico nomen vestrum: Alcor..”

Turns out Alcor is not a fan of human sacrifice, and has a habit of raising human children.

Tl;dr: It would be cool to see a crossover with the Transcendence AU of Gravity Falls where Alcor the dream demon raises Harry, and does his best to be a human dad for this trouble prone wizard.


** That will be funny.

**** I have not heard of Transcendence or Gravity Falls. However, if the story is well written, I am more that willing to read it. I have read other crossovers where I had not heard of the story being crossed with. The author did a good enough job filling in a short backstory synopsis, that the reader did not feel lost not knowing the other story.

I like your story idea and would not mind reading something similar.

** The ground shook with terrible rumbles and the three dursley continued their chanting, dudly was starting to have second thoughts as the lightbulbs started to exploded but his parents said it was ok so he continued.

Harry was in the middle of the circle crying and tied up, he knew he was going to die and it terrified him. What had he done to make them hate him so much.

Soon this terrible noise rose like the millions scratching souls of the dammed calling for freedom erupted in the room.

And there he was tall and terrifying with eyes and black as night and skin as red as coals (I havent watched gravity falls) with black swirls and etched runes decorating his horns and hooves.

He stared at the family of idiots and spoak /#^{WHO} DARES SUMMON ME!!#/^ his voice held numerous difrent pitches and volumes making it sound other worldly and almost mind breaking to hear.

He sneered in disgust at the fat walrus of a man who kneeled before him, the vernon dursley spoke.

"Oh great demon we have for you a sacrifice for an exchange , will you accept our sacrifice?"

The demon was confused, patunia motioned to the circle in front of him, he almost took a step back at what he saw. A terrified little boy tied up on a crudely drawn pentagram he then noticed that the boy was also bleeding. He snarled at the pathetic human and swooped down to the child, slicing his claws throught the ropes.

Harry curled up in a ball and continued to sob this was it his death had finaly come, but after a while harry notice he wasent being eaten of sliced up, he could hear the demon mumbling harry practically had a heart attack when he heard what the demon was saying.

"Oh you poor child what have they done to you, how could somone do this to their own child' then the demon noticed Harry's wrist he gently took the chikd wrist and sucked in a tense breath and how torne the skin was.

Harry looked up at the demon and whispered out "it hurts" still crying. The demon looked at the boy before seeming to come to a disichion, he glared at the family before beginning his own chanting, the dursley too afraid to ask questions, after a minute the demon finished and waved his had through the air and harry and the demon were gone.

Patunia looked to her husband in fear "I think we have done a terrible thing vernon, I dont think we should stay in the country anymore"

Vernon nodded before bellowing at duddly to start packing.

*** Nice. It's all good if you haven't seen Gravity Falls, since Alcor is from a fan collaboration AU anyway.

He looks mostly human, but he floats, has wings, wears a black suit, has pointed ears and teeth, and gold pupils on black sclera. When he gets angry he gets a third eye on his forehead, and becomes entirely black, with a golden brick-like pattern all over him.
