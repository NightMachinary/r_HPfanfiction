Don't know why these people are being so hostile all the sudden, it might just be a coincidence but let's stay strong anyway.

Strength to all shippers! We may not all agree on the same ships but damn do we like shipping!

We often have threads here about how fanons messed up people's perception of canon. Courtesy of fanfics, many think the following are true:

- Dumbledore believes in Greater Good and worships the Prophecy.
- Hermione will never break rules.
- Ron is a jealous idiot who should not be in the Trio.
- Ginny is a love potion using slut.
- Draco is just misunderstood and has a heart of gold.
- Luna is a seer.
- Snape is an attractive sex god.
- Lucius Malfoy is an attractive sex god.
- Death Eaters are good, and the Order is bad.
- Harry has the lordship of Potter, Black, Gryffindor, Peverell, Slytherin, and etc...
- Harry has gazillion Galleons in his family vaults.
- Dumbledore and Molly steal money from Harry's vaults.
- Dumbledore dumped Harry into an abusive home with the sole purpose of better manipulating and sacrificing him in the future.
- The first meeting between Harry and the Weasleys is a setup with the purpose of bringing him under their control.
- The train is not empty, and Ron is asked/paid by Dumbledore to spy on Harry.
- Molly is a crazy control freak, all her children hate her and will leave home as soon as they are 17.
- Molly love potioned Arthur.
- Being friendly to Goblins will suddenly make them very helpful.
- Goblins can administer inheritance test, and allow Harry to break free from Dumbledore's machinations.

I think it's quite understandable why canon purists utterly despise fanfics.

****** Those people have actively gone seeking things outside of canon though. The concept of fanfic isn't damaging or harmful for canon itself, because no one is trying to pass it off as canon.

With the exception of the dumb as fuck HP Wiki which does confuse people.

****** To take some of those a canon based step further..

#+begin_example
  ⁠Harry has the lordship of Potter, Black, Gryffindor, Peverell, Slytherin, and etc...
#+end_example

Lordships aren't a thing (pure fanon).

• ⁠Harry has gazillion Galleons in his family vaults.

Harry has only one vault.

• ⁠Molly love potioned Arthur.

Actually partial canon. Molly did brew a love potion once as a younger girl, but there's no evidence she used it, let alone on Arthur.

• ⁠Being friendly to Goblins will suddenly make them very helpful.

• ⁠Goblins can administer inheritance test, and allow Harry to break free from Dumbledore's machinations.

Goblins are bankers. Not probate attorneys, not genealogists, and are definitely rarely friendly.

Edit: Thought of one more. Life debts aren't a thing ether.

*** The thing is, romantic relationships are a quintessential part of the human existence, and outright ignoring them isn't the recipe for a good story because it misses something.

**** I disagree, the idea of romantic love that currently permeates society is a fairly new concept, in the grand scheme of human history.

More over, even taken to it's base truism, that ~lust~ is a quintessential component of human existence, I can still do without it. I don't need to read about a characters bowel movements, or their masturbatory habits either, and yes I classify their hormone induced bouts of lust in the same fashion. It rarely helps the story along, and in that odd occasion that it does, the build up necessary isn't worth it.

**** In fanfic the only difference I've noticed between gen fic and that focusing on romance or simply including it is that gen fics don't have pages upon pages of smut or can do without mentioning sex. I don't think I missed a lot. Romance often follows friendship and friends argue, make up and fight just as lovers do. And yet those fics I've read that didn't have romance impressed mEe far more than those that had it. I even had a lot to think about after reading fics that had ordinary relationships as their main component.

It is annoying in fandoms where there are very few non romance fics though, but HP doesn't seem to have that problem. A lot of the most popular fics are gen.
