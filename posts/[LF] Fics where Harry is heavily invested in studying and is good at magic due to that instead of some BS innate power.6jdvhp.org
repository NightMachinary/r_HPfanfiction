I've gotten bored of the fics where Harry is instantly some kind of magical prodigy with almost no effort. I want fics where he trains or studies instensively, with proportional increases in abilities.

Slash or whatever is grand too.

** linkffn(the many deaths of harry potter)

Seriously, Harry works his ass off in that fic. It's hp/hg, but there's really very little romance in it. Also, I found it to be pretty edgy, but not in a cringey kind of way, more in a Harry is a little unhinged kind of way. It's a seriously great read.

I think this might be my all time favourite. Harry works his ass off for everything. He isn't even all that powerful, just insanely hard working, devious and brutal without being a sociopath.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725][Forging the Sword]] - "For a want of a nail" type fic that diverges from the end of CoS. Great take on magic system, that's creative and stays close to canon at the same time. Rather slowpaced, with the whole third year being focused mostly on the character- and worldbuilding. Sadly died just when plot was started getting really interesting. Though considering author's earlier hiatuses I still have hope for more updates. In this case the change is in mechanics of the diary - killing Tom would also kill Ginny. But not killing Tom would also mean that Ginny will die. And so Harry is forced to do a hard thing and kill his friends sister. And things spiral out of there.

[[http://tinyurl.com/jkc2qeu][Alexandra Potter]] - The first year of Girl-Who-Lived in a more magical Hogwarts. It focuses on school life and author's variation on magic system. Only the first year is complete, but it stands on its own and theoretically, there is a new version planned. With theoretically being the key word here.

Original Description:

#+begin_quote
  First year fem!Harry AU. Alexandra Potter has finally come to Hogwarts, where she will meet new friends and discover a world of magic. But will an escalating rivalry threaten all that she's built? Character-driven story, lots of world building. No canon rehash, no bashing.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358][What You Leave Behind]] - Year older Harry who puts more time in studying magic and looking for secrets of the school. Another canon-ish yet original take on magic. On hiatus.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809][Harry Potter]] [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=17021][and the Boy Who Lived]] - Non-BWL Harry attends Durmstrang. Fic focuses mostly on his magical research. I have some problem with how it often goes into "Harry is so awesome", but it's still a very good read. And of course, it's dead.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10557311/1/The-Magnate][The Magnate]] - Inspired by the above fic comes this AU in the world where Voldemort won. Unfortunately pretty short and hiatused so far, but I hold hope that Halt will continue it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125300][Black Luminary]] - Non-BWL Harry adopted by Blacks in the world where some of the old pureblood families (Bones, Prewetts, etc.) made a power move after Grindelwald's defeat to get other old pureblood families (Blacks, Lestranges, Malfoys, etc.) out of the politics using protecting muggleborns' and half-bloods' rights as an excuse. Strong wordbuilding, slow pacing. Just came out of hiatus.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2740505][Wit of the Raven]] - Heavily AU fic, with an interesting alternative system of magic and more meritocratic Hogwarts. Strong focus on school life and especially school competitions. Dead.
