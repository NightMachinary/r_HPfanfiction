** I've thought about saying something like this, and I've noticed a lot of my comments have included inquiries and well wishes for health. Authors that engage their readers are remembered very fondly. One of my favorite authors went silent for over two months after updating her fics very regularly (talking like twice a week), and I worried about her so much during that time. It was oddly like a distant cousin, funny how people sneak into your life, right? She came back to a lot of people asking about her health and wishing her well.

** If I'm being entirely honest, I don't think anyone would care -- my personal followers. It's a kind thought, but really, I don't think I've written anything extremely significant for there to be a large enough following that would really dismay if my stories were discontinued.

**** I was so surprised when I began updating a story I'd started and paused in 2010. I came back to it in 2018 and finally completed it. I expected no one to read it, but it got quite a few favorites and comments. I can't tell for sure if any were from former readers, but I sometimes imagine them vaguely checking their favorites list and seeing my story there with the COMPLETE tag and getting excited to read it again.

***** That's great!

If a story I used to read in the past suddenly gets updated again then I will read it. Only reason I wouldn't would be if my taste in story writing has changed.

Hope people will read your update'

**** That's reassuring to know. I've been thinking of officially saying “feel free to take this and write it yourself” but I was afraid an update that turned out to be a non-update would irritate people. Been about 6-7 years since I updated some.

** That's extremely thoughtful!

I have been updating any one of my multiple stories once a month and commenting about my current situation in the author's note. So if any of my readers of different fandoms want to know(care enough to check), they can see in the last updated section, my last date I mentioned I was alive...

** We are still waiting for the second wave, and even though I have had it and survived covid without having to go to the hospital, I am convinced it hurt my lungs enough with 3,5 months of horrid coughing that I don't trust I am out of the woods yet should I get a lighter version. I could post an "I am all right message", and still kick the bucket within half a year if I am extremely unlucky.

Especially because my spouse will have to start teaching again within the next week. In my situation such a message would be extremely premature until I am vaccinated.

Moreover, in the times I haven't posted for a year my few readers don't know if I am too lazy or died in an automobile accident either. They'll hear from me with a sporadic update, and not a second sooner.

**** Thanks, you stay safe as well. But that is the thing, saying you are safe now really says nothing about how we will survive the epidemic. When the vaccinations are available to the public and we are recovering from whatever the last wave may be it'd be a good time to say: "Hello dear readers, I know I haven't posted for x time, but don't assume me dead and expect something in the next year or so."

An "I am not dead yet" message sounds kind of useless unless you actively keep updating it because you can still get killed by the virus. If you forget to do that you actually will have your readers in a panic.

This is no terrorist attack where you can mark the Facebook button that says "I am safe", and people can trust it to be true even a month after posting it. This is an uncertain time for everyone and imo, an "I am safe" message creates false security.
