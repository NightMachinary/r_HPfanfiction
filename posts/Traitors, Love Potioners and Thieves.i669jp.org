Literally everybody tries to use Harry for his money, magical power, political power or anything else really. Because of that they inevitably stop nefarious plots of other people and it the end nobody is succesful and Harry stays none the wiser.

In other words lets put gold-digger Hermione, potion-queen Ginny, manipulative Dumbledore, obssesed fangirls, edgy Slytherin girls trying to make him a new Dark Lord all in one story and then add a lot of crack.


** I don't know what's the best for Ron in such a Prompt. Is he one of the many people wanting to use Harry or steal from him? Is he the only want that don't want to use Harry but who doesn't know anything about all these plots because "Bacon!"? Or is he some kind of sidekick for Ginny (maybe even a "stupid" sidekick like Kronk is for Yzma)?
