I'm looking for something spooky. I want shivers to run down my back and for my hair to stand up on end when reading the story! Ghosts, ghouls and anything that go bump in the night are welcome! Preferably less gore because gore isn't spooky, it's just gross.

  Eight-year-old Ron knows his crazy Uncle Billius wasn't as cracked as everyone believes. Wearing gloves in the summer, pockets full of cheering charms, terrified of Patronuses: all of these things seem pretty reasonable to Ron who can see the Grim just as well as his Uncle could. Ron is content to ignore the creature until he accidentally-on-purpose kills someone.

** Linkffn(Deathly Hallowed) is pretty creepy. I didn't read more than half of it, but I think it was alright.

  The Tale of Three Brothers was not a legend. It was a warning. No one cheats Death. And luckily for Lily Potter, the promise of the Cloak's return in exchange for her son's life was a fair deal. Stare into the abyss, Harry Potter, and we will see who blinks first.

** The Strange Disappearance of SallyAnne Perks is a classic ghost story staple. There's no gore (that I can remember) and legit creeped me out the first time I read it. Highly recommend!
