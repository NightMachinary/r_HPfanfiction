Since the Canon, Book 2 and 5, dont make a Taboo or secret from it, i would like to know Fics that contain a incest Relationship. It doesnt matter if its known or unknown, so if these People know about their Connection or not. Also i would like if this Relationship would happen with an OC, but im not rejected if a Canon character falls into an unknown and forgotten Relative.

â€‹

Im curious if good and serious Fics exist.

  Harry and Rose Potter faced everything together...until the Ministry ripped him away from her. Now, finally, Rose - with the assistance of Gabrielle Delacour - has found him again. They've got a plan to fix what was broken; and maybe get a bit of revenge along the way. Pairing: Harry/OFC/Gabrielle (twincest).

** I wish I didn't know these off the top of my head, but Linkffn(Remus Lupin and the Restaurant that Attracts Annoying Customers) and Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Unnecessarily Amorous Relationship) feature Potter twincest.

  Twenty years after a falling out with the rest of the Marauders, Remus Lupin has completely cut himself off from the wizarding world and opened a restaurant in the muggle one. Unfortunately for him, his past comes back to haunt him in the most irritating way possible: his restaurant seems to attract the weirdest possible customers, both magical and muggle. Episodic, Remus-centric.

  After killing Voldemort immediately following his ressurection at the end of their sixth year, Harry and his twin sister Danielle decide that, as the law of the land refuses to penalize the Death Eaters, they'll do it themselves. And so, they decide to rob them all blind. Warning: twincest. Lots. Of. Twincest.
