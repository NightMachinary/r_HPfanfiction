** I dabbled with the idea of an OC with a talent for Legilimency/Occlumency and other mind magics getting an Octopus/Cuttlefish animagus form. Cue mind-flayer jokes.

It never went anywhere and I ended up scrapping it, though.

  Harry grows up watching anime and fantasizing about having superpowers. When his Hogwarts letter arrives, he jumps at the chance to live the life of a harem protagonist. Not a harem fic. Timeline moved forward to modern day.

** You didn't say whether you would accept slash. Here's a "Snape lived" scenario wherein Snape is a scorpion animagus. He even gets huffy every time somebody refers to him as an insect instead of an arachnid. Snape/Harry.
