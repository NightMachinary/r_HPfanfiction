I love Sirius and I want more fics with him being a badass. I've read a bunch (A Marauder's Plan most recently) and I just enjoy clever/powerful!Sirius way too much. The more politicky the better, but any time period works. Preferably complete but as long as it's long and grammatically coherent I'll read it :D


** I recommend the *Promises Saga*, by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/22909/Robin4][Robin4]]. It's an AU where Sirius actually becomes the Potter's Secret Keeper instead of Pettigrew. Keep in mind, though, that these fics are *LONG* and heavy, and are focused more in the relationship between the protagonists than the action itself. But don't worry, there is plenty of action throughout all the story. And Sirius ends up becoming pretty badass by the end of the story.

â€‹

The reading order should be this:

1. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1248431/1/Promises-Unbroken][Promises Unbroken]]
2. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1567001/1/Promises-Remembered][Promises Remembered]]
3. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2204188/1/Promises-Defended][Promises Defended]]

There's a prequel to all of it called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4881348/1/Promises-Honored][Promises Honored]], which takes place before Unbroken, but it feels better to read that in the end, after you have all the background of all that happened in the other fics.

In this saga Pettigrew is not a traitor, but only because he didn't get the chance to become one, since, as stated earlier, Sirius is the one who takes his place as the Secret Keeper. He is a Death Eater, though, but he redeems himself in a very believable way and later develops into a pretty good character.

*** Starfox usually writes trio-centric with quite competent supporting characters, including Sirius and Dumbledore. My favorite Starfox Sirius was in Lady Thief.

  Sirius has a very different reaction to hearing his godson has been attacked by Dementors. Taking matters into his own hands, Sirius struggles to navigate being a good godparent to Harry and trying to fight the war on a whole new front. (On Hiatus)

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.
