This is such a common HP crossover trope, the more I think about it. And admittedly, it's a very useful plot device/immediate plot push to put Harry in whatever world/unexpected situation you want quickly. It just sort of dawned on me while I was browsing through the HP crossovers on [[https://FF.net][FF.net]].

How many fics have y'all encountered with this same trope? Any of them you like/have stood out to you?

** That's exactly what happened in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Broken Chains]], linkffn(7718942). They both end up in the Star Wars and are captured by the Empire. Harry has spent about 4 years here, and returns to the HPverse only 41 days later. There is also a sequel called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]], linkffn(12040341), that crosses further with Star Gate. In typical Darth Marrs fashion, both fics are full of brilliant and ridiculous moments.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12195136/1/Legend-of-the-Gryphon][Legend of the Gryphon]], linkffn(12195136): Not Harry, but Ginny jumped through the Veil a few years later after Sirius. They meet in Essos, and soon begin building an empire. Rhaegar Targaryen joins them later.

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.

** Well, it's logical to explain of course. Either you have to use reincarnation or something similar to it, use a literal gate that is an open unknown ending from the books, misuse the time turner or invent your own magic. Compared to the gate, a spell or potion feels a bit contrived and rituals are tricky to write.

I don't really mind it. No need to make things difficult on that portion of it's not necessary for the story. The way I see it the gate is ideal for "accidental" time-travel or universe travel. For deliberate travel, I like something else being invented. It's not a trope that bashes or reduces a character or some such unbelievable things.

I've lost count on how many but "I'm Still Here" by Kathryn is probably the most well known one. A simple but nice crossover I like is Sorcery, linkffn(10054816), an unfinished HP & Frozen crossover. It's simple, but everything works so far. It's a real shame there aren't more (good) crossovers, because, well, it's obvious magic as a playground.

** I read a semi-decent crossover with Criminal Minds that uses the veil as a portal to an alternate universe. It was along the theory that there was a best-of-x wins required to win the war overall and take over. I can see if I can find it I'd you're interested.

  Harry was born a Hotchner. After a painful twelve years of separation, Hotch decides nothing is ever going to divide his family again. Not the looming threat of Tom Riddle, not the benevolent concern of the Hogwarts staff, not Hotch's own demons. Meanwhile, Harry struggles to balance his American family with the growing responsibility he begins to face in Britain.
