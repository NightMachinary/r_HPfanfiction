The Potter children have grown up, and by gods, they have made a profound impact on the world (and beyond). Practically everybody has heard of (at least) one of the three.

A young reporter (magical or otherwise) aims to make it big. As luck would have it, they score an interview with the father of the three. This terrifies them more than anything. Why? You decide.


** I mean raising an evil mastermind and the smartest person in the world and the most powerful person so you expect him to be slightly insane and I don't know maybe she just doesn't like insane people

** Because compared to his children Harry is relatively down to earth and likable, but his kids have all developed a father complex and threaten the reporter's life.

** Because there are assassination attempts involving lots of collateral damage on Harry at every step ever since his children tracked him down years after he went to buy Floo Powder and never returned.

** If this is in a world where Harry Potter is a story told to children, I can imagine they would find it hard to believe, but it's a way of explaining where three incredibly talented siblings came from. Not expecting this Legendary figure to be more than the legend, but only interested in talking about his wife and children's accomplishments. Every time the reporter brings up a historic deed of this Mythical Harry Potter, he scoffs and say's sure, but remember when Lily defeated 2 dark lords at once. Or when James robbed 5 historic museums around the world in as many minutes!? Bah, master of death, I'm too old for that shit.
