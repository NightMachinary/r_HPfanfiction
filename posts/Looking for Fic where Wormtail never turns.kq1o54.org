Recently new to this subreddit and haven't really come across anything of this topic yet. A Fic that focuses around the original order, and what would of happened if Wormtail never betrayed Lily and James. Open to any suggestions that are similar to this.


** The only story I have read where Wormtail doesn't turn/join the Deatheaters is a time travel fic called Stepping Back by TheBlack'sResurgence

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
