Fics where MC, preferably Harry or Hermione, are awakened from a slumber to find that the world has completely changed? Crossovers welcome, no harems, please.

Thanks!


** Linkffn(2857962) is a favorite, with Harry waking centuries later in the Firefly universe era.

--edit-- I had the wrong number (added a 9 at the start) the first time.

  COMPLETE. Firefly: :Harry Potter crossover Post Serenity. Two years have passed since the secret of the planet Miranda got broadcast across the whole 'verse in 2518. The crew of Serenity finally hires a new pilot, but he's a bit peculiar.

** Well, I have to recommend [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Happily_Ever_After/index/][Happily Ever After by Jeconais]]. Harry gets woken by a grown Gabby. Its kind of the opposite of what you wanted tnough. The world hasn't changed and that's the problem, but Harry waking up is the catalyst that's needed to see true change finally happen.

It's short and pretty light honestly, but I'd still recommend it.
