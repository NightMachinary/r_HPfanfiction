I would like to see a Harry Potter that finds out he is related to the Blacks and also find out about Grimmauld place and goes in to the library and find books of the Black arts as in the family magic stuff like old rituals and things like that old magic form my the beginning of the Black line and he becomes a Dark Lord in time.

I would like to have him paired with hermoine whom get burned alive after her parents find out that she is a witch that reason why they tried to burn her alive is because the are related to witch hunters from the old days like the Salem burnings. He finds out and helps her and together they delve in the dark arts and the old family Black magic. And together they are getting revenge for Hermoine's burning and the fact that nobody had told Harry to whom he is related.

I like it to be a long story.

Thank you all for this awesome Harry Potter thread on Reddit
