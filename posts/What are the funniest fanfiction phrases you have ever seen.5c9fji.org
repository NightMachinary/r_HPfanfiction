For me, it was in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6289435/1/Myrddin-Emrys-Returns][Myriddin Emrys Returns]] when Merlin used the ancient version of a "Your mom" insult.


** Sirius: "Of course we're not going to have you kicked out! Why on earth would we do that?"

Remus: "Because-because I'm a monster!"

James: "You're being dramatic. You fold your socks, Remus. Forgive me if I'm not trembling at the sight of you."

'The Life and Times' is witty perfection from start to finish.

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5200789/1/The-Life-and-Times]]

Let me tell you right now that this series is widely accepted as one of the best Marauders Era EVER written.

There's an entire fandom on Tumblr dedicated to it.

Buckle your seatbelt and say goodbye to productivity.

** linkffn(The Apprentice and the Necromancer by JunoMagic) featuring disco Snape dancing with his apprentice in the Slytherin common room:

#+begin_quote
  Snape must have waited for her momentary inattention, for he gripped her hand and drew her against him, even as he stepped out onto the dance floor. His black hair flew as he moved to the rhythm, his eyes flashing dangerously.

  Hermione---flustered, surprised, clumsy---stumbled, caught herself, was pulled close to him, then pushed away again...clearly Snape knew what he was doing---dancing discofox of all things! When her mind finally caught up with her feet, she managed to growl at him when the dance brought their bodies close.

  ‘But you don't dance!' she accused him furiously. ‘You never dance!'

  His answering smirk was positively devilish. ‘I never dance in public,' he replied. ‘Not everything is as it seems, Hermione. You, my dear disciple, need to develop some appreciation for subtlety.'
