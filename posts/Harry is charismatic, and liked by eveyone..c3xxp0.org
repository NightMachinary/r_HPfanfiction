  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.

** There's linkffn(The Tinkerer by wickwynn) - After a lot of hard work Harry kind of stumbles into becoming rich and famous in the muggle world, so he gets used to being something of a celebrity. Also the Dursleys treated him better as a result.

When he gets to Hogwarts and realizes his situation, he actively cultivates a positive reputation. This fic goes pretty deep into the too-smart-11-year-olds trope though.

  The Dursley family, who valued normalcy above all else, would of course never dream of keeping their orphan nephew in a cupboard, or of making a spectacle of him. That isn't to say they wanted to spend all of their time and money on him, however. From the salvage of broken toys and unwanted junk, left alone to his own devices, Harry built dreams.

******** He literally started pursuing legal action against Dumbledore as soon as he realized he maybe should. He's trying his best to have the man put in Azkaban.

The Durselys treat him sort of alright in this story. It's not nearly as bad as canon.

What other horrible stuff? Nothing horrible has happened to him yet.

It's fine, this is just a discussion. I don't understand your viewpoint, so I'm asking about it.

************ I'm not trying to argue with what you want, I just don't get it.

He's 11 years old. I don't think he's even 3 months into school yet. For his age, sneaking out of school to meet with the Director of the DMLE to try and go after Dumbledore of all people seems very aggressive to me.

What is directly confronting Dumbledore going to accomplish, other than giving him warning? How the heck would he break Sirius out of Azkaban? Hell, I don't think he's even aware that Sirius exists yet.

************** Yeah it does. That's sorta one of the points of this website. Discussion, exchanging ideas, arguing about them.

I didn't say I'm not arguing with you, I said I'm not arguing with what you want.

I'm asking you to clarify, because what you're saying doesn't make sense to me.

You want Harry to directly deal with Dumbledore and break Sirius out of Azkaban. What does that mean? Duel Dumbledore to the death with magic he doesn't know, then somehow not get locked up for it? Why would he break someone out of prison when he has never even heard of them?
