What is your ideal pairing, your favorite, and/or your least favorite? I'm really curious about who you like to see paired with characters and who you hate seeing with them.


** I always thought it'd end up Harry/Fleur in canon before book 6. I mean you've got your protagonist, you've got the insanely hot woman, you've got the meet cute(the whole bouillabaisse thing where Harry's all awkward and shy), you've got your tension(Harry being picked as champion) then you've got your resolution and a way for them to become close friends(Harry rescuing Gabrielle). So yeah Harry/Fleur is my fave

*** I think Fleur is done a huge disservice in canon as well. In some ways she goes from being a Champion to becoming rather strangely hamfisted arm candy. I think her inclusion back into the books later actually harms her character.

I try not to inspect too forcefully into how canon pairings got set up, and they are okay. Really, the canon pairings are okay, but they don't inspire me. Rowling even admits that the pairings weren't inspiring. That's fair, she wasn't writing a romance novel, and she stuck to her plan, which as a writer I know can be incredibly frustrating when your characters derail your plot, sometimes you just beat them back into place instead of examining, and sometimes we just want to finish writing the story.

Harry/Fleur would have been inspiring, Harry/OtherStudent would have been interesting in stretching the cast of characters, of giving Harry perspective outside his rather constrained world.

I think what was ultimately missing is Harry never really had an equal. Or at least it never feels like he did. And given this is the story of a severely neglected and traumatized boy, forming connections was incredibly hard for him, but that I think is the problem. Even right up until the end of the series it never feels like Harry really formed that deep abiding connection with someone. He's never free from his hell. It feels sad. Ginny seems like a consolation prize, and that does neither Harry nor Ginny credit from a storytelling perspective.

I think that's what makes me like Harry/Fleur so much, Fleur is literally mythological beauty, Helen of Troy levels of beauty. Harry is a serious and conflicted teenager, he literally lives hell every year and its still better than his home life, because at least when he's facing Voldemort he has friends. If my first year of high school had been anything like Harry's first year of Hogwarts I would have bought a boat and lived on it, never to see land again. You'd have to have a REALLY compelling reason for me to come back to shore, especially after second year.

I think Fleur is compelling enough. Or at least I think she could be.

A young neglected man carries a burden, and for a moment he is swept away by a truly magical woman. I think this idea is what makes fics like A Cadmean Victory popular even in spite of some of their deep flaws. Harry has something to fight for that the reader can actually grasp for a moment.

What irritates me about most Fleur fanfics is that she is treated as just arm candy. She's pretty hooray! Hell even canon doesn't really show properly that she is a formidable witch. It leaves Ginny in the same lurch too of course, powerful women that aren't in some sort of mothering role are rather absent in Harry Potter, or they get killed offscreen (poor Amelia).

I think I've rambled enough. Basically, I think Harry/Fleur done right is one of the best, but its so easy to just be lazy about it, in fact you could take almost all Harry/Fleur fics and turn them into Harry/Daphne fics and you'd barely notice. What's worse is how useless the female character is as anything but a romantic interest for Harry, which is a shame.

In other words, I want more Battle Couple stories.

***** Fleur isn't my favorite character. Harry is.

I grew up without a real mentor, I really identify with the floundering and difficulties and the angst that Harry suffers from as a result.

When I say a character was done a disservice part of it is the style of narrative. We only gets things from Harry's perspective really. But even then I think Fleur is odd.

In the Goblet of Fire we really only know a touch about Fleur, but we know she finds Hogwarts dismal, and Britain by extension. We know she is incredibly proud. Out of all the things that could be taken from her, it was not anyone at school, no they had to import a family member. And she cares so much she goes from being best described as a stick in the mud to incredibly demonstrative towards Harry. Then she abandons her family in France to work with Goblins of all people and in Britain a place she already said she disliked. That is dissonance to me. When she re-appeared later I was so shocked I actually set the book down, and re-read portions of GoF to make sure I didn't miss anything and still was incredibly confused. I had been expecting to never see her character again, just like Krum.

Then we get to spend all the time around Harry with the Weasley's watching her get insulted. Valueless interactions in my mind other than painting Ginny as incredibly petty, which I never really got from anywhere else.

But I don't mind canon Harry/Ginny at all like I said. For what little we see of her, Ginny is a strong and determined witch with just a touch of insecurities, which from a big family like hers ins't surprising, and she's pretty, and she likes Harry, and she spends a lot of time with him at the very least through osmosis. She works as a romantic interest without much need to justify it, so I can't really complain.

** Given how the characters are written in the Books, I'm fine with canon pairings. After all, JKR wrote the Epilogue even before PS was finished.

However, I'm not happy at all with how Ginny was portrayed in the Books. JKR said several times Harry and Ginny were soulmates, and yet refused to give her a bigger role. It was a contradiction in itself. Hermione and Ron each appeared roughly 7000 times in the series, Ginny only about 800 times. This discrepancy for such an important character was simply too big. Ginny especially got short changed in Book 7, 100 more pages (would still be shorter than OoTP) about what happened at Hogwarts would go a long way to improve her standing among readers.

--------------

My favorite non-canon pairing is Harry/Hermione/Ron. The Trio friendship and relationship is a fundamental theme in the Series, and I love seeing them getting together. Also, I'm not bothered by the unconventional M/F/M relationship. Given how many writers push M/Multis, why can't I support my favorite female character have both her beloved boys?

--------------

Other pairings I like are:

Harry/Astoria

Harry/Luna

Hermione/Victor

Ginny/Luna

But overall, I'm pretty pairing neutral as long as the story is convincingly written, although I won't read male slash fics with the exception of Harry/Ron in the context of a romantic Trio.

**** Unfortunately there are very few:

"Finding a Place to Call Home", linkffn(9885609): Harry ran away with Astoria after being abandoned by everyone before the First Task. The story is OK, but not great.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3084182?view_adult=true][The Minister's Affair]] is quite the tragedy and only an one-shot, but very well written.

"Heterochromic", linkffn(10938984): Although Astoria is listed as a character, it's not really her.

--------------

The reason I like Astoria so much is because from the little tidbits JKR gave us, she appeared to be a great woman who fixed up Draco and taught Scorpius to become such a great kid. Her unfortunate early death added more mystery. I really want to see more fics exploring this character in greater depth.

** Ignoring Harry/x pairings. I really like Hermione/Fred or George.

The reason it appeals to me is not that Hermione is stiff and Fred is relaxed. Its that's they are both extremely clever and motivated people. The twins have always appealed to me because they are such good natured people, friendly, relaxed, relatively unprejudiced. They just love having fun and being magical and spreading their insanity.

Hermione is actually similar. She's incredibly good natured, incredibly passionate, focused and driven, and insanely clever. Inside of it all though Hermione loves being a witch, its part of why she's so driven I think. I think somewhere in the back of her mind, the child of two dentists, the most average girl in the world (at least in her own mind) has been given this incredible gift of magic. She never spurns it.

I think that dynamic of passion is interesting when its explored. Hermione clearly wants to make something of her magic, and Fred/George do too, even if its not expressed in the same way, I think there is a unique connection to be made there, to find that same love in someone else.

HP/AT would be cool. I picture them both being rather devastated after the war and independently dedicating their lives to making Teddy's life great. They would share this, Harry would date around and not find anyone that really understands him or how much he values Teddy. Then the ship would happen.

** I must be an outlier here, but my favorite pairing is no pairing. I prefer to read stories with a focus on story and plot, or great friendship, mentorship or parent relationships rather than romance. I do read romance when the story or characters are compelling enough, which mostly includes canon pairings or more darker pairings since conflict is quite fun to read. I do try to avoid slash if possible though, or at least when it's not in the background.

My least favorite pairings is any femslash pairing, or harry/multi. I am also not really a fan of Harry/Fleur or Harry/Tonks either since I do not really care for either of them and found Fleur kind of annoying. Have not really read any Harry/slytherin girl fics and don't really have an interest in those.

** I've shipped Harry and Hermione together since before I even started reading fanfic. Think it was around the time POA came out that I started really shipping them. So that's my ideal and favorite pairing.

My absolute least favorite pairings are Harry/Ginny, Hermione/Ron, Snape/Anyone, and pretty much all slashfic. (Got nothing against slash, I'm LGBT irl, I just dislike reading it in my fics.)

Finally, I have A LOT of guilty pleasure favorites that are odd pairings. Harry/Luna and Harry/Tonks are among the top.

** /One that's believable./

But if I'm not answering OP's question like a dick, I'd say ...

*Ideal:* Luna/Harry or Luna/Hermione. Luna provides an interesting counterbalance to both characters but in different ways -- for Harry, a friendly (if weird) soul interested in him for his own sake; for Hermione, an utter challenge. I've never found a fic that's entirely convinced me of those pairings, though; Luna is devilishly hard to characterize correctly. So, basically, those two pairings get me nothing but tumbleweeds.

Runner-ups are Padma/Harry or Cho/Harry -- they're strangely rare.

*Favorite:* When I'm in the (infrequent) mood to actually read pairings, I used to go straight for the trash. Usually Tom Riddle or Voldemort paired up with some chick. It still makes me slightly nostalgic, but it's kind of boring now -- always the same in-Hogwarts melodrama (if Riddle) or some really creepy slave-type shit (if Voldemort). Eugh, no thanks.

Every once in a while though, I'll hit on something with Riddle or Voldemort that's actually decent /and/ lacking the usual creepiness -- like the abandoned and very offbeat linkffn(Ad Infinitum by Speechwriter).

*Least Favorite:* Most of the canon pairings that form as the books go along. Ron/Hermione and Harry/Ginny do absolutely nothing for me; I've tried to like them, but I just /can't/. Tonks/Lupin is possibly the only one that might be interesting to me, but the fics I've seen left me cold.

Fluff just isn't my thing, I guess.

Also, most m/m fics in this fandom are too yaoi-y and cliche to be bearable, so I generally pass on them. But I pass on most pairings-centric fics anyway for similar reasons -- cliches, unskilled writing -- regardless of the genders involved.

Edit: Downvoted on an opinion post? Well then, I'll just upvote everyone else here purely in the name of friendly disagreement and letting people have their own tastes.

** I've always liked Harry/Luna and Harry/Hermione, probably because some of the first fics I read were Harry/Luna/Hermione.

I don't do any main character slash, aka Harry/any guy, since most of the fics I read have him as the main character. I don't care if it's in the background, something like Sirius/Renus, for instance. Following from that, I'm not a fan of Fem!Harry, since it inevitably pairs a character that I'll always consider to be male with a guy.

I've read a bit of Harry/Fleur and Harry/Tonks recently, so that's on my mind. Not my preferred pairings, but I'm not against it by any means.

I don't really like canon!Snape paired with anyone, or Voldemort paired with anyone. I could see Voldemort using someone like Bellatrix as a source of pleasure, but I can't see him having any real emotional attachment, unless he's been written to be not insane/justified, etc. If he's going to be paired with someone seriously I'd rather they be an OC.

For the same reasons I don't like stuff like Draco/Hermione, or Draco/Ginny.

Harry/Ginny seems pretty bland to me, but it's fine in stories that have romance on the back burner.

There really aren't that many characters in the HP universe to choose from, are there? I read a lot of crossovers, which tend to pair Harry with someone in whatever universe he falls/hops/is pulled/is born into. But the same general rules apply.

Least favorite pairing is hard, because there are a decent number of deal breaker ships for me. Some of the ones I've been most out off by include Ron/Luna, Harry/Orion Black, and Harry/Voldemort.

Not my least favorite pairing necessarily, but I'll generally not read Ron/Hermione fics unless there's something else about the fic I really like.

** I like unconventional pairs, be they dysfunctional or just generally unprecedented in some way. I lean heavily towards reading AU despite the fact that I love canon.

Only, I don't know if it's me or JK Rowling, but the endgame pairings came off to me as rather lacklustre. I don't think I read pairings for the romance, really, even if it's a romantic pair, but instead more for the dance of it. Character interaction like this was more shallow in the books, somehow. Maybe. I second guess myself because I'm pretty sure I'm aro or ace or both and am not a Good Authority on healthy relationships or how they should be presented. RIP.

Anyway, I'm rambling. I like these:

Lucius&Severus

Tom&Harry^{1}

George&Hermione

Charlie&Nymphadora

Charlie&Harry^{2}

Severus&Harry

Gellert&Albus

All first names, because consistency is important.

I still haven't found a decent fic for these two....linkffn(Saving Draco by You're All So Vacant) had this adorable chapter where Charlie takes Draco to a mall and he's scared of the escalators, but it was a bonding fic and that doesn't really appeal to me on principle....99% of the Draco/Charlie fics I've found are just...not believable. Draco is either too whiny, Charlie is not fully developed as a character, the plot is unbelievable (I just can't with the mpreg) and....yeah. Charlie and Draco. I hold out hope that I will one day find a fic to satisfy this.

  I really wanted to try a bonding/marriage fic, and I haven't written a Charlie/Draco one before, so I figured I'd have a go. As Draco has the dark mark, he can only be taken into the order- and protected- if he has someone to take credit for his actions, someone to look after him. A spouse. His only option is Charlie Weasley, the 'attractive, intimidating one'. R&R

** When I started reading the books to my kids, Hermione seemed the obvious choice for Harry, but that changed when GoF came out. My wife said from the off that Ginny was meant for Harry,

So Harry & Ginny is my fav. Along with others, I think she gets seriously short changed in the books; as for the films....I'm also beginning to despair of the state of H&G fanfic as there are precious few writers left who write anything other than tooth rotting fluff. (not a cue for a list of recs btw). I have started to read a lot of Gen fics.

My least favourite? Its basically H&G with anyone else, but Ginny/Draco has to be the worst. Snape/Lily gets a special mention as does Scorpius/anyone.

** Harry/Daphne or Harry/Gabi Delacour. Least favourite, Snape/lily Potter, I would rather drink bleach than read that and have stopped reading some stories when it cropped up in the back ground.

The why, Harry is a sarcastic, smart but not academically inclined person who always tries to do the right thing. I despise the epilogue for its happily ever after tone. I want more post Hogwarts stories where things aren't so great, where Harry struggles to adapt to life without Voldemort. His whole life was dictated by that fight and he had no real plan for an after. Ginny is fine but she's almost non-existent and I really didn't like how she treated Fleur. I feel Harry would either find someone a bit more cynical, a Slytherin who like him is a little bitter with the world. I really want more stories (Or any good ones at all) with a Harry/Daphne pairing that explore the dynamics of Draco and Harry being brothers in law. Without the death eaters, some of the richest people in soceity how does the magical world survive? Hermione is a prat, read books 1 and 6 if you've forgotten. She means well but doesn't play nice with others so she would likely create more problems than she fixes in her moral crusades.

Post Hogwarts with a more jaded world weary Harry, I love the idea of injecting the little ball of innocence that is Gabbi Delcaour. A bright spark in a dark world, something to pull Harry out of his slumber. Basically post hogwarts I can't see things being nearly as happy and simple as JKR does. I would love to see more of a struggling Harry who either pairs with a cunning Slytherin or an innocent person with whom he can escape the memories of the war.

Whilst in Hogwarts my favourite pairing is still Daphne. Why? Because I want to learn more about the wizarding world. We know about the muggle world, we're from it, show me more cool magical stuff. Moving past the ridiculous notion that muggle world=good and civilized whereas magical=barbaric then we don't really know much. A slytherin pureblood provides a perfect window to explore the magical world through. I can't say much about personality since she's basically a blank slate but her position in the world and a more objective, cynical mindset befitting someone of Slytherin I believe would mesh well with Harry. I think that with Ginny, I always question if Harry is in love with her or the idea of being in love. I know JKR says they're perfect for each other but if so she did Ginny a disservice in the books.

** I like Bellatrix/Voldemort because I can alllllmost see that in canon, except Bellatrix would be her obsessive, desperate self and Voldemort would use it to his advantage. Not much romance and touchy-feely (which I don't like in general).

Or Bellatrix with like, anyone else sexually, because she's hot.

** Harmony because it 'seems obvious', mostly because of the staging in the movies (Hermione is usually right next to Harry with Ron in the background - I think they overdid appeasing Harmony shippers.)

Next to that, Harry can be paired with Luna, Daphne or Fleur without causing me heartburn. Hermione can pair with one of the twins, but I don't like her with Ron. Neville can pair with Luna or Ginny, but I don't really care.

Everybody else can match up on their own.

** If I had to work with canon and change as small amount of things as possible, my favorites would be Harry/Fleur or Harry/Luna, Hermione/Ginny, maybe Hermione/Bill, and Ron the professional Quiddich player living the bachelor lifestyle.

Without any downright massive changes, I'd say Hermione/Fleur (if it wasn't for the unnecessary animosity between them), or Hermione/Draco (if he got a decent redemption arc).

That said I pretty much only read femslash because I'm gay as fuck, and my all around favorites are Hermione/Bellatrix or Narcissa (or both). I just love how many different possible conficts and drama you can create from those pairings, unfortunately it takes a lot of work and a good author to get it right without a timetravel-ex machina.

** I love Harry/Luna, also Hermione/Luna, tho I don't like Hermione/Luna when Hermione acts like she does when they are in school. In school Hermione js rude when she disbelieves Luna's ideas, and I feel like she would have grown out of that if they were going to start a relationship. I also enjoy Harry/Daphne (Ice Queen Usually, but doesn't have to be), and Harry/Fleur. I would enjoy a Harry/Myrtle fic but all I've seen is 2 fics that are smut (I wish there was more smut of it too). I still haven't seen a Harry/Lily Evans (preferably marauders era), that isn't smut, or is not just a crush (like in Delenda Est). I also have a soft spot for Harry/Bellatrix, but there is so few fics with that.

My least favorite would have to be Severus/Anyone, Voldemort/Anyone (except Bella, but I can see a pairing when he is younger and not become a dark lord yet.) I also dislike Hermione/Harry, and Ginny/Harry.

** One that I'm a fan of seeing explored is Harry/Colin. I would like to see a dynamic where Colin learns that Harry isn't just some famous person, but an actual hero that indirectly saved his life. This causes Colin to reflect on his stalker ways and helps him discover who he really is (3rd year goes by largely like in canon) and finally, in a stroke of faith and that famous Gryffindor courage, stands up for what Harry says when everyone else doubts him about placing his name in the Goblet. It is in that moment when Harry reciprocates that courage and lays himself bare (not physically) in front of Colin and tells all.

A couple correspondence notes later, and the Dursleys start to get curdled milk from the milkman, and the story goes on from there. Sirius would (maybe) get exonerated early, Colin has a knowledge-seeking bone in his body and gets an Occlumency book out of the library while Snape administers Harry's lessons, and a few more alterations afterward.

If someone could write a fic like this, I'd appreciate it. Putting the Horcrxes in play or not and, if so, killing Colin off at the end is up to you.

** I'm a fan of HPLV/HPTMR, not because I like thinking about Voldemort's naked body (ew), but because I tend to enjoy the kinds of stories that include it. They tend to be dark and twisted and full of inner conflict, which is just what I like reading about. I don't actually care if Harry and Tom get it on or anything, as long as they're main characters and become close in some way. I've seen romance between them done excellently, and done so badly I felt slightly sick. The only thing I won't read is Voldemort raising Harry or grooming him. Childhood friend, sure, but father figure...ewwwwww...

Least favorite would be Harry/multi or Harry/random minor female character from another house. Like, why should I care about Daphne or Astoria or whatever? It's basically Harry/OC, which I'm not interested in. Harry/multi is just obnoxious, imo.

edit: linkffn(11972693) is a perfect example of HPLV that's done well. Slow burn, very dark, lots of inner conflict, not romantic in the least.

** I admit I'm a big fan of Harry/Hermione, especially as to me up until the end of Order of the Phoenix it was leaning towards them. When Half Blood Prince came out, I was really annoyed as Madam Rowling turned Hermione into a complete bitch.

When Deathly Hallows came out there were times when I thought that maybe, just maybe, Harry would end up with Hermione, especially in scenes like Godrics Hollow. Alas the Battle and Hermione started snogging the village idiot, leaving Harry to be with the fan girl.

Recently though thanks to fan fiction I've been on a bit of a Harry/Daphne (or Susan, Pansy or Delphini*) kick, with no end in sight.

*-Delphini for me is interesting as I usually put her birth back in my fics to be Halloween '79 (significant as it seems to be fates way of screwing Harry over!). The thought of the Boy-Who-Lived getting with the daughter of his parents killer is quite...interesting...

*On the other hand,* the thought of a certain Potions Master or Bearded One even considering reproduction is nausea inducing
