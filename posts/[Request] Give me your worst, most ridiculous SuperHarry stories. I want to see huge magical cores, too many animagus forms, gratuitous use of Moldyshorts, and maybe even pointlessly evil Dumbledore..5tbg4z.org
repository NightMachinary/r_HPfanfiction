** Linkffn(The silent world of Cassandra Evans) is soooo much fun. Features gratuitously evil Dumbledore, a different cool tattoo for every life achievement, creating a fifth House because the student body hates you so much, violence as a first resort, and lesbians everywhere. Kick over-the-top misogyny in the balls with steel toed boots and watch Voldemort increase his life expectancy in this fic by [[/spoiler][resurrecting himself as a new and improved Fleur Delacour]].

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.

Lily Evans sacrifices herself as per canon, but her blood sacrifice draws the attention of the Aztec pantheon of gods, who elect to give the baby Harry Potter their blessing.

Fast forward 11 years, Harry and his dire jaguar familiar are invited to Hogwarts, where Harry (who doesn't need a wand) instinctually homes in on the Chamber of Secrets, releasing the Basilisk to serve him and gaining various divine animagus forms (from big cats to giant snakes to giant crocodile things and more).

From there, he is tasked by the gods with tracking down and slaughtering every Death Eater, pureblood supremacist, and Umbridge, destroying Voldemort despite his horcruxes, and taking 5 minutes to foil Dumbledore's non-specific get-rich-and-powerful-quick scheme.

  Harry's world is flipped upside down when he is visited by a naked fairy on his fourteenth birthday. Finding out that he is a rare type of incubus known as a Choiceling is the least of his problems when he finds out just how drastically his life is about to change. How will young Harry manage an entire year at Hogwarts when he has to have sex at least once a day just to survive!
