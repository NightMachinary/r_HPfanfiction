Harry has found himself in the Wild West during its prime, when outlaws and lawmen run rampant with Samuel colt's equalizer strapped to their waists. (He could meet up with others that were alive in this time, such as the Flamels or others totally gonna write a version of this myself but I'm curious about what other people could come up with)


** It's a good idea - especially if it goes all weird-west - but I only know one decent-ish cowboy-Harry fic and that's West of Here. It's not spectacular and Harry expresses some period-appropriate stereotypical views on women (He slaps a lot of arses and I remember him using the word 'filly' a lot), but it's the only one I remember being somewhat readable with a decent plot.
