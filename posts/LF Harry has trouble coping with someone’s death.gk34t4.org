** I'd slide in my story since it deals heavily with mental health after the third task. PTSD, night terrors, self-harm, anxiety attacks, etc. I studied psychology HL for my IB diploma so I have a decent amount of knowledge regarding abnormal behaviour and disorders. So I apply a lot of it in the story.

The way Harry handles death is way too tame in the order of the phoenix. So I sought to rectify that. It does make the story dark at some points but I try hard to not make it depressing.

I'm not going to post the fic here since I want organic growth + I'm doing mass rewrites since I haven't updated in 2 years. I can offer you a private edition of the first rewritten chapter if you want in PMs.

  Canon Divergence from HBP. When Harry fails to save Ron's life in Slughorn's office, he and Hermione are thrust into a search for answers. But the path is thornier than either of them could have possibly imagined.
