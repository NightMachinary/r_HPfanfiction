I just thought it would be funny to write but if its overdone then I might not

Also mods I'm so sorry idk what to flair this


** I've never seen one, but it's a lovely idea, so I think you should write it! (And I'm not a mod but I would flair this as a request I think? But misc works anyway)

** I used to have one where the snake became Harry's familiar and they escaped together and tried to go to Brazil, only to be interrupted by Harry's letter, but I'm disappointed by my original (old terrible fic) and while my rewrite is better, I only have three chapters so far and haven't updated in a long time. I might continue it at some point, but have been busy with another fic.

*** Found your fic(A familiar's intuition, rewrite), read it, and it looks promising. Save for that horribly cliche paragraph in the middle of chapter 3, I really enjoyed the read.

  What if the boa constrictor from the zoo had sensed something was seriously wrong with Harry and gone to Privet Drive to rescue him? What if they had travelled until Harry's letter came? What if the boa constrictor had gone with Harry to Hogwarts? And what if the Wizarding World had believed a lie? Evil!Dumbledore, Good!Voldemort/Deatheaters, Abusive!Dursleys. BEING REWRITTEN!
