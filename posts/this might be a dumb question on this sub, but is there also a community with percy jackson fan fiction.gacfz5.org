** I don't know, but I'd recommend you try ask on the [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] sub as well! There's a whole bunch of fandoms united there, so you'd be as likely to get a response there as here.

** Try [[http://www.percyjacksonfanfiction.com/Stories/]]

Other than i think all the larger fanfiction sites Fanfiction.net, AO3, Wattpad etc have percy jackson sections.

** A community like on reddit? I don't know

A community of fanfics? Yes! There are tons, but I often find they are worse written than the avg HP fanfic. Idk why but that's a trend I saw and it's why I never got into it too much. At one point there were a lot of HP and PJO/HOO crossovers but many are abandoned and written poorly so the good ones are kinda hidden. I prefer ao3 as a suggestion
