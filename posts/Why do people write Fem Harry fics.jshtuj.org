I've been reading FanFiction for a little over a year now and I've noticed that a lot of FanFiction has fem Harry can anyone tell me why? It's basically just Harry from canon but female in my opinion it doesn't move the plot at all and when it does it's just boys drool and girl rule things


** linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) uses Harriett Potter for multiple reasons. Firstly, it draws on elements of Alanna the Lioness, so having the main character be a girl impersonating a boy just makes sense. But it also works better because canonically, girls can enter boys' dorms but not the reverse - so a boy would have a very hard time impersonating a girl.

Some other stories might use a female Harry just so that they can have Harry in the girls' dorm, forming closer friendships with Lavender and Parvati than with Ron and Dean. I don't follow a whole lot of fem!Harry stories, so couldn't say.

(By the way, for a while I ignored The Pureblood Pretense on the assumption that the gender swap would mostly not affect canon that much and just be a gimmick. I was very wrong. It's heavily AU, with rich world building and a whole new story that's merely influenced by canon rather than controlled by it.)

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

** It's normally to see how the dynamics of different characters would be.

For instance: How would the Dursley's treat a female Harry? How would Snape, Malfoy, the Weasley's, Dumbledore, etc treat female Harry?

Same with reversing any other character's gender, really.

There's no doubt in my mind that a female Draco for instance, would be treated very differently by Lucius and Narcissa then male Draco.

It's just fun to play with different dynamic ideas.

** people have already answered this question. now for my question, why do you ask? its the same thing as for bashing, oc's, alternative pairings, etc. yeah it can be just a canon harry rehash, but that applies to every story and trope. there's tons and tons of great and bad fem!harry stories as there is tons and tons of great and bad OC harry for example. its such a weird question to ask, its like asking "Why do people sort Harry in different houses, if its just canon Harry with that house's traits?" most of the time fem!harry doesn't even come close to canon

** I'm gonna copy-paste something I wrote regarding this from 6 months ago.

Well, for starters, I guess female writers can relate more to a female MC? I don't think there's anything wrong with that, since being able to relate to the MC leads to a more enjoyable experience in reading. I'm sure the fandom has a lot of female writers and as such, some of them would like to write a female!Harry story.

Another aspect could be the exploration of possibities regarding said situation. What if Harry was a girl? What could change? That itself is a pretty valid argument to write a story, since pretty much every fanfic can be reduced to "the exploration of possibilites within the canon story."

And lastly, it could better fit the narrative of storytelling. Maybe your plot revolves around aspects and themes which are best fitted for a female MC, and therefore, it would be easier and more enjoyable to read a story in which the MC is a girl.

For example, I have an unfinished story where pre-Hogwarts fem!Harry goes back in time and ends up in being found by her grandparents(James' parents). I thought it would be better if Harry was a girl since the father-daughter bond is sometimes seem as stronger than father-son, and James would be more accepting of her as a result, also, James's mother would finally complete the pair(son and daughter) and would be more protective of her.

That said, I don't particulary search for fem!Harry stories, so I can't say much.

** Probably to explore the differences that would happen. For example, would the Dursleys abuse a female Harry as much? I don't think anyone would be fine with a group of boys beating up a girl or a girl showing up in their cousin's very large clothes and exhibiting obvious signs of abuse.

There is also more of a range of characterizations a fem!Harry can have. She can be a girly girl, a tomboy, a sensitive bookworm, or more, while it would be weird for a male!Harry to gossip about boys or be neurotic about his looks.

*** IMO, in order for fem! Harry to be less disturbing then Dudley will have to be born a girl too because it is disturbing to see male on female violence.

**** Would a fem!Dudley be like her canon counterpart though? The Dursleys (and the whole neighborhood) allowed Dudley to be like he is (cruel, violent, etc.) because "boys will be boys", but I can't see a fem!Dudley not being raised to be obedient, pretty, and the perfect housewife, so I think the dynamics of fem!Harry and fem!Dudley would be dramatically altered.

I agree with you on male on female violence making most people feel uncomfortable, but I usually just force myself to get through it when reading fem!Harry fics.

** Depends on why Harry's a girl. Some of it is admittedly an excuse for heavy femslash smut others does have a point at least that I've read. Like A fair life by rtnwriter has a lot of plot driven by the fact that harry was born female but was changed by Dumbledore in an attempt to protect them from pureblood family's trying to force harry into a marriage contract and stuff like that. Cause and side effect has harry turned into a girl after hearing cursed by Malfoy and he has to learn to live with the fact that he might only be able to change back temporarily. Both have fem!harry as a major plot point that imo seems plausible given the context of the stories

** For me personally I love Harry potter but I love a strong female lead even more. So often having a fem Harry potter gives me the best of both lol. I'm open to most tropes and pairings at least once though. I've stumbled upon some unexpectedly amazing fics by being open minded lol.
