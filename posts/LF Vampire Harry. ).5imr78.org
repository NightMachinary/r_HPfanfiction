I'd prefer complete and lengthy stories, but beggers can't be choosers. I'd prefer no harems... slash is preferred, but I can deal with anything, really.

Thanks in advance!


** My favorite is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish]] no slash but has vampire Affected harry.

** linkffn(2737363) Twists of Fate is, in my opinion, one of the, if not /the/ best take on vampire!Harry out there. Lupin raises him in this fic and Harry is wonderful snarky in it.

linkffn(2649475) Lord of the Night was in my "decent" folder, but I honestly can't remember the details of it. It has been a DLP forum recommendation, though.

At last, shameless self-bump: linkffn(The Bloodmoon Rises). My own story with 50/50 story-arcs covering Harry and Hermione.

  Voldemort had not only sent his Death Eaters to the Ministry, but vampires as well. Hermione and Harry fall to them and find themselves in new, undead lives. While Harry struggles to remain human, Hermione becomes what was believed dead long ago. She becomes a Countess, an heir to Dracula. Unfortunatly, there are no books on that. Vampire!Hermione/Harry, Dark!Hermione Dark!Harry

*** I think you posted this a week ago on a thread about a guy asking for a 'half-vampire' :)

I have read Twists of Fate, but thank you for linking it so I can bookmark it. The summary's a tad misleading, though.

13,000 words, :(! That fic looks good, as well.

As for yours, I'll give it a read. Nothing satisfying like evil-ish (dark) vampires. None of this drinking animal blood.

Thank you!

**** Yeah, I just reposted because I don't really know anything else in that category. Its a rather dry genre of fanfics once you remove all the Twilight stuff.
