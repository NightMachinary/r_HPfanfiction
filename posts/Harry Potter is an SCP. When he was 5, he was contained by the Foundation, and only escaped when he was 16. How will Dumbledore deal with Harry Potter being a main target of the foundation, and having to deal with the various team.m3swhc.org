#+TITLE: Harry Potter is an SCP. When he was 5, he was contained by the Foundation, and only escaped when he was 16. How will Dumbledore deal with Harry Potter being a main target of the foundation, and having to deal with the various teams sent after him?

Because of a kind witch/wizard who took the initiative was sent by the Foundation to tutor him, Harry learned up to 6th-year magic under the guise of it being muggle subjects (which he learned as well).

Harry is a dangerous keter-class SCP with abilities that DO NOT stem from him being a wizard.

Bonus points if you include SCP-053 and SCP-682 as his friends.


** There is a potential fundamental error in this - in SCP universe there is a recognized magical school called "Mages Academy Hub" that SCP foundation does NOT antagonize. It'd make more sense to send him there instead of locking him up.

** I just thought of this, could a Dementor be considered a SCP?

*** I think it could! Like, there's no real, exact in-universe explanation for why Dementors are the way they are, and it is possible that they're anomolous in their properties because I can't think of another canon thing that produces that effects.

*** SCP is a website where there are fake "monsters" catalogued. I use the term monsters /very/ loosely because not everything mentioned is an actual sentient being (at least not observably sentient).

If i remember correctly, Control took a lot of inspiration from it. Many of the altered items have odd backstories and files detailing their behavior attached to them in the same way that the SCPs do. These files even have a lot of blacked out sections in the same way SCPs have redacted sections. And the FBC itself is basically the game's version of the SPC foundation. The biggest difference that I could observe was the SCPs can sometimes be visibly sentient and organic life (sometimes resembling monsters or demons) while Control's altered items are exclusively supernatural objects.
