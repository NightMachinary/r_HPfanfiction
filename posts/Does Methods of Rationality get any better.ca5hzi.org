Read the first few chapters... and man this just reads like the author is jerking himself off on his apparent cleverness and mediocre sense of humor.

Like when Harry's parents flee the room literally screaming of laughter because of a mildly amusing thing Harry said. Or when three shopkeepers literally fall to the ground laughing because Harry is goofing around. It's just so cringey.

But there's a lot of popular fics I think are attrocious.....

#+begin_quote
  Just blank all the angry screaming about the author out of your mind, look at the story as a story, try to follow what's going on in-universe, and forget all the allegations of invisible, unfalsifiable evil intentions going on behind the scene. I'm sad that so many people are coming into this fic with blatant lies about the author's grand malevolent intentions twisting their interpretation of what's meant to be fun and chaos. I meant the story as a story.

*** For me Big Bang Theory is cringe but HPMOR was fun. The reason why I found BBT cringe is that it tries to make nerd/scientist humour but from the outside, without really understanding how nerds or scientists tick. Many things can be said of Eliezer Yudkowski, but not that he's not a nerd or a scientist. HPMOR can come off as petulant or self-important, but it never gave me the impression that Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres isn't a believable insufferable little nerd. He's grating at times, but he's meant to be, though that still can be a deal breaker since you're stuck reading about him.

The whole armies business is a lot of fun, with plenty of clever resolutions and strategies. My least favourite bit is probably the Azkaban trip, as that's the most contrived of all arcs IMHO, since it requires Harry to be just downright stupid to agree to the thing in the first place.

***** He appears to ignore it in the moment. It's actually the moment where Harry realises he's made a giant mistake about the kind of person Draco is, and the kind of society he's entering into. He then sets about trying to deradicalise Draco.

​

Like, MoR is an acquired taste, and it took me a very long time to trust that it realised Harry was an arrogant git a lot of the time, who is fucking dangerous to himself and others. I 100% respect that most people will not want to read 100k plus of fiction in order to get to that payoff, even if I enjoyed it.

​

But that is the point where the story turns from being a superficially comedic takedown of the original canon to being a much darker, more serious examination of its implications, and the story very much does fully engage with how fucked up that is, AND how fucked up it is that Harry chooses to address it with deception and trickery.

  Draco wasn't a psychopath. That was the sad and awful part, knowing human psychology well enough to know that Draco wasn't a monster. There had been ten thousand societies over the history of the world where this conversation could have happened. No, the world would have been a very different place indeed, if it took an evil mutant to say what Draco had said. It was very simple, very human, it was the default if nothing else intervened. To Draco, his enemies weren't people.

  And in the slowed time of this slowed country, here and now as in the darkness-before-dawn prior to the Age of Reason, the son of a sufficiently powerful noble would simply take for granted that he was above the law, at least when it came to some peasant girl. There were places in Muggle-land where it was still the same way, countries where that sort of nobility still existed and still thought like that, or even grimmer lands where it wasn't just the nobility. It was like that in every place and time that didn't descend directly from the Enlightenment. A line of descent, it seemed, which didn't quite include magical Britain...
#+end_quote

I would say it's a far more realistic interpretation of how wizards/purebloods would likely be raised than is usually seen. The entire point is that the book tries to be realistic about that sort of thing, and then look at realistic effects from such causes. As opposed to other fiction that never looks at secondary effects, especially things like secondary uses for technologies introduced to solve a plot problem.

But that story is much darker and with more dense world building than the comedy that MOR is supposed to be.

Rape is a seriously dark topic for MOR, seeing as I always saw that fic as a comedy full to bursting with 'clever' humor meant to make your head spin following the logic. But then again, MOR has been around for some years. It might not have hit the 'yikes' button as much as it does nowadays. (of course it did hit the yikes button, just maybe not as often, to be clear)

Yudkowsky wrote the story to promote the rationality skills he advocated on his site LessWrong. Yudkowsky chose Harry Potter because "I'd been reading a lot of Harry Potter fan fiction at the time the plot of HPMORspontaneously burped itself into existence inside my mind, so it came out as a Harry Potter story. ... there's a large number of potential readers who would enter at least moderately familiar with the Harry Potter universe." He states that his work on rationality "informs every shade of how the characters think, both those who are allegedly rational and otherwise". He also used it to assist the launch of the Center for Applied Rationality, which teaches courses based on his work.

***** It's not a comedy - that's the line where it turns from superficial comedy to something much more serious, and it remains predominantly drama and political intrigue for the next 100+ chapters.

​

It's okay if you think it's gross and didn't like how it was used. I'm on the fence about the execution in that specific moment, too. And it's stuff like that that meant it took me a long time to trust it as a piece of fiction. Ultimately, I do like it, but I rec it to others with a lot of caveats because it honestly does take hundreds of thousands of words to get to the payoff where you realise a lot of the shit you thought was self-satisfactory smarter-than-thou bullshit was actually meant to come across that way. And if it pisses me off when people tell me to watch an entire season of a TV show to "get to the good bits" I'm sure as shit not gonna pull that same trick with fanfiction.

​

But the purpose of that line wasn't humour, and rape is not prevalent in the story. I think that's the only explicit reference to it.

** TBH, I find so-called rationalist fics in general to be insufferable. They are little more than page after page of the writer finding all the plot-holes or narrative inconsistencies of a given story; then transforming the main character into their mouthpiece to lecture all the other characters (and by extension the reader) on how to fix them. As if they were the first person to ever notice these issues with the original work.

Only good one I ever read was Friendship is Optimal, and that was because the author's know-it-all mouthpiece was an AI, so it's all encompassing knowledge and lack of humanity made narrative sense.

*** That's why you should stick to /rational/ fics, instead of rationalist fics. Rational fics tend to focus more on storytelling than on "educating" the readers, and as a result are way less pretentious and condescending.

In rational fics:

- Characters: solve problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.

- Goals and motivations: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.

- Worldbuilding: the fictional world follows consistent rules.

Sounds long-winded, but it's just a story where the plot makes sense and you don't go, "Hang on, why did Harry have to wear the locket in the tent?" when you finish the story. Obviously, some stories go too far by turning human characters into an Optimizer Prime, so logical and utilitarian they're basically emotionless sociopaths. But at least you get to avoid most of the HPMOR's.

*** To be fair, you have to have a /very/ high IQ to understand HPMOR. The plotting is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of history and political philosophy most of the story will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Harry's political outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation -- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Machiavelli's /Il Principe/, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of the plot, to realise that it's not just a story -- it says something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike HPMOR truly ARE idiots -- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the history behind Malfoy's catchphrase “As soon as I'm old enough I'm going to rape her”, which itself is a cryptic reference to mid 18th century French feudal politics. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Eliezer Yudkowsky's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them.

And yes, by the way, I DO have a HPMOR tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only -- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin' personal kid.

Yeah, I personally enjoyed the story, but I can absolutely get why someone wouldn't. The first chunk of the story especially feels bashy way too often, and while it gets better about justifying all characters' actions instead of just dropping anvils later on, and has some pretty interesting reasons for why Harry acts the way he does + runs him through character development, I can still absolutely get why someone wouldn't want to slog through that just to get to the default required. I guess my best advice for anyone who legitimately wanted to enjoy it would be to read it as effectively a crack fic at first and enjoy the humour, and not take it too seriously until it starts taking the world seriously itself.

Except one thing - he has his characters make arguments. "What an asshole!" is the sort of reaction to the story that only makes sense coming from someone intimidated by it.

Rick and Morty's copypasta being a meme doesn't mean that different stories don't have different demographics.

Nobody has any evidence showing that HPMOR fans view themselves this way or that they'd be wrong if they did. That's the point my broad statement was meant to highlight.

That people in this subreddit are quick to see the story's fan as arrogant and cringey just for liking the story and thinking it's got fun, smart ideas implies tremendous insecurity.

This is the equivalent of linking to [[/r/iamverysmart]] when someone mentions going to college; it's making fun of someone for getting an A on a test; it's grounded in an expectation that nobody sensible can earnestly like the story, and a fear that if we acknowledged their enjoyment is reasonable it might imply they're somehow superior to us.

It's a grossly paranoiac attitude, and one that in my experience is disproportionately common among those who've got good reason to feel intellectually insecure. They can't share in the appreciation for the work that others feel, and so desire to tear it down.

I don't think a healthy fanfiction subreddit would have regular bashing threads such as OP's reach its the top of its front page for a story like this that's been positively received by some absolutely fantastic authors in the community, but that's the state of the subreddit we've got.

******* They didn't declare the community too unintelligent to understand and enjoy the story without justification, they did so as an attempt to explain the weekly hatefests it receives. When there is this degree of dislike for a story, we need something more than random idiosyncratic preferences to appeal to. Based on the content of their criticisms, I think it's reasonable to think that a lot of the story's haters are driven by feeling condescended to, like they believe Yudkowsky was writing arguments for the purpose of mocking them or brainwashing them. I also think that such a stance is unreasonable, and its prevalence is much better explained by an intolerance of shamelessly bold argumentation in the audience than by the story's actual problems being so severe. It is simply obvious that we are not meant to swallow many of the positions HJPEV advances, and yet hostile audiences regularly appeal to them as a justification for hating the story, because they feel uncomfortable seeing them.

That isn't an argument driven by arrogance. Not all arguments of the form "some people hate X because they're not its intended audience" are wrong or boastful showboating, even when the intended audience is one that's intelligent and not intellectually insecure. You can't use someone saying that the hate only makes sense if it's driven by resentment as a justification for the resentment, at least not without first showing they're wrong.

I'm a fan of 'clever' humor that drives you in circles with ridiculous unnecessary long-winded logic, so it was a great fic, in my opinion, until I got bored and ditched it around chapter 72. Like I get bored with most fics after a certain word count. I think Harry reigns in his arrogance and overthinking somewhat after a while, and you definitely see consequences to what Harry thinks is /absolutely the right answer/, but the long-winded logic and clever humor remain.

But YMMV. People either love it or hate it, apparently.

True, but HPMOR also has an in-universe explanation for that. The best part about HPMOR is that it actually explains all of the weird bullshit, Petunia being nice, all of it.

** Define "better". It definitely gets /different/ --- in that it stops being a kinda-goofy parody of common canon and fanon tropes like the first few chapters and develops its own, more serious plot. But if you find the sense of humor and attitude of the early chapters are not to your taste, it's unlikely you'll sympathize enough with Harry in the later chapters to be much invested in said plot.

***** Well you can lie about the criticisms that you're basing your opinions on. Like if you say "This story is bad because the characters do things that make no sense!" and the person writing that is too drunk or bad at reading to actually recognize the explanations for why the characters did those things, then the review is only "spot on" to people who are similarly bad at paying attention to story details.

Now if it's like "The humor is really cringey," that's an opinion and it might be spot on to you while not to others, but as a review of the work overall, "it's an opinion piece" doesn't shield against criticisms of why it's a bad review for anyone not just looking for something that bashes it.

********* Sure, right in the very start of the review where it tries to summarize all the things wrong with the story:

#+begin_quote
  *Ron and Hagrid are basically dismissed out of hand in this story (Ron explicitly as being useless, Hagrid implicitly so) because they aren't intelligent enough, and Hariezer explicitly draws implicit NPC vs real-people distinctions.*
#+end_quote

This is the kind of sloppy misattribution of intent that marks reviewers like this as bad readers to HPMOR fans; the problem with insisting that the author and Harry are supposed to be the same person, and so anything Harry says the author must also believe, is that the story constantly points out Harry's flaws.

So in this particular case, the /story/ does not dismiss them out of hand just because the protagonist does. He's a flawed protagonist, and the story shows that. Harry's dismissal of Ron early on and treating him like an NPC is explicitly highlighted as a mistake when both he and Draco lost their first battle to Hermione, who used her soldiers like Ron who were good at strategy to come up with ways to defeat both of them.

This was not even subtle. Hermione literally explains this to another character right after it happens:

#+begin_quote
  "How long do you think it will take Malfoy to figure it out?" said General Granger.

  "Not long," said Colonel Blaise Zabini. "He may have already. How long will it take Potter to figure it out?"

  "Forever," said General Granger, "unless Malfoy tells him, or one of his own soldiers realizes. Harry Potter just doesn't think like that."

  "Really?" said Captain Ernie Macmillan, looking up from one of the corner tables where he was being crushed at chess by Captain Ron Weasley. (They'd brought back all the other chairs after Malfoy had left, of course.) "I mean it seems kind of obvious to me. Who would try to come up with all the ideas just by themselves?"

  "Harry," said Hermione, at exactly the same time Zabini said, "Malfoy."

  "Malfoy thinks he's way better than everyone else," said Zabini.

  "And Harry... doesn't really see most other people like that," said Hermione.

  It was kind of sad, actually. Harry had grown up very, very alone. It wasn't that he went around thinking in words that only geniuses had a right to exist. It just wouldn't occur to him that anyone in Hermione's army besides Hermione could have any good ideas.
#+end_quote

But hey, maybe the reviewer was drunk for that whole arc. Next up:

#+begin_quote
  *Not until Hermione dies, near the end of the story, does Hariezer pick up a positive goal again (ending death) and he does absolutely nothing to achieve it.*
#+end_quote

Apparently "absolutely nothing" includes having invented the spell (his new Patronus) that allows someone to be brought back from the dead.

Again, this is not subtle. Voldemort restores Hermione's body, then gets frustrated by her remaining a corpse, and thinks that /maybe/ if he uses an electric shock to restart her body she can be restored as a muggle, but then Harry uses his Patronus and brings her back to life with her magic, at the cost of some of his own.

#+begin_quote
  "Expecto," Harry shouted, feeling the magic and the life rise up into the Patronus Charm that was fueled by both, "PATRONUM! "

  The girl in the Hogwarts uniform was surrounded by a blazing aura of silver fire, as the Patronus was born inside her.

  Harry staggered, as he felt a dip, a bite. Intuition or Tom Riddle's memory told Harry that the life and magic that had just flowed into Hermione would never return to him, either one. It hadn't been all his life or all his magic, not by a long shot, there hadn't been time to expend that much, but whatever he'd just expended was gone forever.

  And Hermione Granger was breathing, just like she was sleeping, rhythmic inhalations and exhalations. The twilight sky had dimmed further, and Harry could not see if color was returning to her, but it should have been, it certainly should have been. She looked to be sleeping peacefully, and it wasn't because being dead looked like sleeping, it was because she was asleep and her body was fine and nothing was hurting her while she slept.

  Some part of Harry, that had somehow managed not to speak up earlier, quietly pointed out that they were still in a graveyard, the recently victorious Lord Voldemort was still in control of the situation, and that his guess about Hermione wanting to be alive was just a guess.

  Harry was still smiling, as he slowly lowered his wand. The celebratory fireworks going off inside his mind were restrained, Harry wasn't screaming and running around in little circles like Professor Flitwick, but that -

  That -

  THAT, Harry said aloud inside his mind, THAT is what I call Step Two.
#+end_quote

Maybe he was drunk through the climax of the story too, right? Or maybe he's just a bad reader who doesn't understand the thing he's criticizing. /shrugs/

**** It's funny how often this "comprehensive review" gets linked, despite it having half a dozen reading comprehension errors on the very first few sections.

Like, it's a clearly joke to people here that HPMOR fans think its detractors are "just too dumb to get it," but when their criticisms literally result from being unable to recount the actual facts of the story correctly, I don't know what they expect us to think.

It's fine to not like HPMOR, most of my friends don't, but I've yet to meet someone who actually hates it that's also able to articulate why in a way that shows they understood it, rather than just getting turned off by the first few chapters because Harry is too smart and obnoxious (the latter of which is a fair criticism) or who thinks the author is portraying Harry as right all the time (despite him constantly making mistakes and paying for those mistakes), or because they dislike what the story does with the characters.

2. For me there are some things which are really good and some clever ideas (e.g., actually the explanation of the scientific method is rather good), but general story is rather boring, way way too long (but that's problem of 90% of all fanfiction), and it ends in some rather weird ends.

**** And you've, clearly, the same streak of poor judgement and reasoning.

HPMOR is the highest-reviewed Harry Potter story on all of fanfiction.net's 700,000 stories. How about you try to try to see the good in the story, instead of joining this thread's dogpiling and shitting on the story? It's pretty pathetic.

Just because you don't like something, doesn't mean it's bad.

***** Why are you calling someone pathetic for disliking something, and then in the next sentence talking about the subjectivity of art?

"Just because you don't like something, doesn't mean it's bad." --> "Just because you like something doesn't mean it's good."

Such an odd point to try and make.

****** Because, obviously, if a /lot/ of people like HPMOR, as evinced by the review count, then it's silly to make unequivocal judgement of the story. Which he was doing.

Reading comprehension, pls.

******* Giving an unequivocal personal judgement on something is a perfectly reasonable thing to do. That just means someone is fully aware of their stance. What's the problen.?

Also the idea that the number of reviews determine the quality of a story is a bit silly isn't it?

First things first, we don't know the content of all of those reviews. So there could be a high percentage of negative reviews.

Next we have the fact that sorting by reviews is almost always biased towards longer stories with a higher chapter count. Some only review once, but there is a substantial amount of people who review each and every chapter.

I mean we could look at both sorting by Favorites and Followed (both of which I'm sure have HPMOR quite high on the list) but those have their own problems in trying to ascertain quality vs simple popularity/presence over time.

****** Ah, I think that [[/u/SnowGN][u/SnowGN]] probably did a filter search sorting by reviews, but left the rating at the default setting of K -> T, instead of setting it to 'All'.

******* It's Draco/Hermione and from what I read of it, it's alright (written well, okay plot). But it doesn't have anything that can grip my interest to overcome my dislike of the pairing (and all the aspects that the pairing naturally brings: not Draco from canon but an idolized version of him).
