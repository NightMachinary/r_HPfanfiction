**** From what I'm seeing, you're breaking rule number three fairly consistently. And all you're doing with making a bunch of threads is drawing the mods' attention to your behavior. Continue if you want, but don't be surprised if you get banned or your posts removed. Mods aren't bound by subreddit rules. Those rules are written for our benefit.

** Low effort threads don't provide much fodder for discussion.

Here's a thought: next time you feel the itch to start a thread in the form of a question, how about offering your own answer to get the discussion going? Otherwise, this just feels like more spam.

**** I would say you're being a cunt, but I don't wanna break rule #3, so I won't.
