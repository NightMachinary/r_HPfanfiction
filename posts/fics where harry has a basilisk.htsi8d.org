This one doesn't quite meet the request, since Harry doesn't have /a/ basilisk...

#+begin_quote
  ONE-SHOT: After Arthur Weasley nearly dies at the Ministry, Harry wonders why Voldemort's snake isn't something more exotic...really, no self-respecting Parseltongue should limit himself to something as mundane as a regular snake. In which Harry makes use of what he learned in Care of Magical Creatures, Kreacher is forced to cooperate, and the Chamber hides a new Secret..

  It all went wrong. Harry was locked away in Azkaban for decades as Voldemort destroys and conquers the magical world and beyond, unchallenged. However, Voldemort's greatest strength will be used against him when Harry is sent back in time with one mission, to kill the Dark Lord before he rises again.

**** If memory serves, it's more like that Kathryn fic where Harry goes back and gets adopted by the Flamels. I think it's inspired directly, but I'm also pre-caffeine so... :D

**** They are both inspired by the same fic. Where Dodging prison is a Harem fic, From Ruin does not have a "Harry potter". As in, no one knows Harry potter even exists.
