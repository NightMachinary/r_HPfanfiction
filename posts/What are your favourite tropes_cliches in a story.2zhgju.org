Or, alternately, if tropes and cliches make you froth at the mouth, what are your favourite concrete details in a story? (I don't mean abstract or general things like "originality", "humour", or "good grammar", though it's clear that's important to a lot of you)


** Personally there's a few things I like to see:

- Competent!Harry. Not Godlike!Harry, but a Harry that treats magic with the wonder I'd expect of an 11 year old who's been told that magic literally exists.

- Decent!Dumbledore. No manipulative or evil Dumbledore for me thanks. It's tired and most stories that use it are more full of holes than Swiss cheese (if Dumbledore is a super competent evil genius why is he outsmarted by an 11 year old?)

- Canon-ish!Magic. Don't break everything by creating an entirely new system of magic for your fic. Keep power levels sensible or everything will fall apart fairly quickly. Unless the new magic system is the keystone of the fic. But it needs to be thought out and limited in some way.

- Canon Departure. At this point I've reread canon so many times I really don't want to read it all over again just to watch a Harry/Daphne romance play out. I'll do it, but I'd much rather the fic thinks about butterfly effect a bit.

*** I agree with your thoughts about Decent!Dumbledore. If Dumbledore was truly evil, he would have taken over the entire wizarding Britain long ago, Voldemort or no. The only thing holding him back in canon was his humanity. If he was manipulative, that stands to reason he would also know how to get away with evil, and would easily be able to kill those who could rival him, and control those who can't via soft power or magical coercion. The only good evil-Dumbledore fic would be a one-shot with a 1984 type plot where the "Headmaster" sees all, knows all, and controls all.

*** Along the same lines of Competent!Harry, I really enjoy fics where Hermione actually put her mind to how magic works. I remember one where she would do things like experiment on potions in her spare time.

I think it's fair enough that people who grew up with it might think magic is a bit blase but the idea that people who get told that magic is real and they can study it don't spend their whole lives seeing what else they can do baffles me.

***** The thing about canon Harry that got my goat (and this was when I was reading it first time through as a 10 year old) was that he's all awestruck when he goes to Diagon Alley but once he's at school it's like he doesn't even care any more.

Magic is his ticket out from under the Dursleys thumb (think of how Tom Riddle regarded magic, as a way of escaping the orphanage). It's also /amazing/. I can pretend to actually have force powers. I can change things into other things. I can do basically anything if I learn how.

Holy crap, as a 26 year old that thought excites me. As a ten year old I was basically praying to whatever deity might exist that I'd get a Hogwarts letter.

Ok, so I'm a bit of a nerd anyway in real life so that probably skews my thinking. But I honestly can't imagine treating an essay on transfiguration the same way I'd treat an essay on the highland clearances, for example.

Magic >>>>>>>>>>> everything else.

Btw, here's a really good new-and-upcoming time travel fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10807718/1/The-Hogwarts-Strike-Team]]

Harry and Hermione go back in time after living in a future where Voldemort has destroyed Britain via dead man's switch. It's a really good one that explores the morality of whether or not it's actually a good thing that they are assassinating death eaters, has actual competent villains who react to Harry and Hermione's actions, and explores how their action in the future has really affected them for better and worse. Best of all, it does this without too much angsty crap. I would argue that it's better than Nightmares of the Futures Past.

For example: Let's see a Harry who isn't Lord Potter-Black-Evans-Prewitt-McGonagall. It flies in the face of Harry valuing just being 'a normal guy' despite all of the crazy things that just seem to happen around him.

I'm not a fan of Lord Potter-Black-Evans-Gryffindor-Slytherin either, but this isn't a good argument against it. In those fics it's generally not something he pursues, so it doesn't really clash with his canon personality in itself. He's just handed a truckload of gold and titles because that's what the author wants to fantasize about. Of course those same authors generally proceed to turn him into a smooth talking ladies' man who spends all his time gettin swole, so eh..

** - *The Potter Manor trope.* Don't know if I would say it's my favorite, but James' parents had to live somewhere and it's not that unrealistic that Dumbledore would elect not to inform Harry. It doesn't bug me unless it's a manor plus land plus a dozen house elves plus the controlling interest of Grunnings.

- *Random run-ins with muggles.* I love fics that look at wizards from a muggle perspective or fics that have characters running into muggles from their past, even when the situations themselves are a tiny bit contrived (Lucius/Dudley sitting next to each other on a plane, Harry runs into the Dursleys at the zoo, etc.). I don't like it when characters overshare or information is shoehorned in for the benefit of the muggles though. For example, Harry running into an ex-primary school classmate and saying "I'm a detective"=good. Harry running into an ex-primary school classmate and saying "I'm the head of this special branch of government, similar to MI5, and I'm a hero for killing this mass murderer."=bad.

XD I've never actually read one where things worked out that conveniently (although several where Harry /bought/ the controlling interest in Grunnings as insurance/revenge) but your comment just really made me laugh.

Fics with muggles I find that the muggles end up curb-stomping the wizards and the wizards just stare slack-jawed and take it .-. So I usually avoid those. I haven't seen what you're describing, but I've seen kind of the inverse, where the main character thinks Justin, or Terry, or Dean, or whoever, is a muggle, and then they meet at Hogwarts and are all like "Justin?!" "Draco! You're a wizard, old chap?!" lol

The Grunnings thing always struck me as stupid, because it's an extremely expensive and complicated form of revenge. You can't just buy shares on Amazon. So Harry buys enough shares to give him controlling interest and demands that some random mid-level employee is fired. And the big payout is a moment of superiority and Vernon losing his job and gets to feel victimized by wizards.

As a Slytherin, I'm offended by the inefficiency and uselessness of that plan. Why not just set it up to look as though he embezzled? Why not call the police and have him arrested? Why not modify Vernon's boss's memory to convince him to fire him? Why not buy Number 3 Privet Drive and spray paint rude words about the Dursleys all over it? Why not use 1% of that money to buy a very small boat and just push the Dursleys into open water?

I never read a oneshot like that but it sounds very satisfying, in the same way I find 'Harry's death eater lover comes home with Harry to intimidate the shit out of the Dursleys and gloat' to be satisfying (I've seen that done with Marcus Flint, Lucius, and Voldemort, and it's equally satisfying with all of them). I think maybe it's because we empathise with the characters and the characters subconsciously seek approval or to awe and impress either old enemies or random bystanders...

I've not read any of this genre so I don't know what's common, but I think a well written one should initally keeping him with boy-brain but gradually change his mentality as he's influenced by different hormones and comes to term with suddenly being the opposite gender (and all the accompanying social differences; I can imagine a lot of people are more interested in hooking girl!Harry up with their boy of choice rather than covering how the wizarding world is going to react to suddenly having a girl-who-lived). It strikes me as the more realistic course of events than suddenly becoming feminine just because his genitals changed.

Amuse Gueule is basically about graduate Draco living off the magical equivalent of frozen dinners, and Harry, who is a foodie and wouldn't wish frozen dinners even on his school rival, putting his foot down.

The Descent of Magic is about Harry being a researcher and discovering that the baby-making problems of purebloods all stem from them treating house elves and other magical creatures like shit, and Draco helps him break the news to the rest of snobby, elitist pureblood society

At least, if I remember correctly. It's been a while since my Drarry burst.

Last week my Christian friend and I had a debate about the evilness of Satan where I was of course playing Devil's advocate. I just really feel a lot of sympathy for them in my heart, as soon as someone is suffering I find it so difficult to hate them. And Voldemort definitely suffered a lot. His whole life. Definitely enough to justify pro-apocalyptic feelings, in my opinion. (Is anthrocidal a word? I guess homicidal covers it but homicidal is so mundane. Not even genocidal gets the scope I wanted to convey of complete species annihilation, because in my opinion I think Voldemort doesn't even associate himself with the human race at all, although they often play down his sheer level of damage in the fics I read)

In my experience Bio!Dad fics are more likely to have bashing and the explanation behind Snape being Harrys dad can often be weak, which detracts from the story.

Also I just think it's more touching for them to reach an understanding when it doesn't involve blood ties.

Some favourites from the top of my head:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3417954/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Enemy-Within]]

Really good Mentor fic. Has a great sequel as well.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2027554/1/In-Blood-Only]]

I like angsty fics and although this sometimes veers into emo territory, but overall I like the darker BioDad!Snape presented here and I think it's a great fic. He doesn't instantly like Harry, which I find more believable.

Glimpse into the future is where the unattached protagonists get transported somehow to the future where they learn they are in a relationship together and must work together to cope with the situation until they can get home, falling in love in the process. Great examples of this are [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/poison_pen/TF.html][Tempus Fugit]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1143478/1/Time-out-of-Place][Time out of Place]] (both Drarry) and [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/dmtabf/MTK.html][Meet the Kids]] (Dramione).

- family interaction between Harry and the Durselys before he learns that he is a wizard. (I love stories about Harry going to primary school!)

- Harry harem or Harry/OC pairing

- Teenager romance drama in an almost soap opera vibe

- Harry doing sensible/ mature things for his age.

- Harry being adopted by Uncle Voldie by whatever reason.

*Cliches that I love to hate*

- Lord billionare Potter - sometimes I wonder how rich he actually is... let's not forget that the first time he saw his Gringots bank he was biased by having never owned any money/ and he was a tinny 11 year old fascinated by pretty much everything. He might own 1 or 3 propertys - fair enough! - but this doesn't make him godlike rich by any means.

- bashing - any kind of bashing... I remember reading a story which had some strong Ginny bashing. I hate Ginny... I really do - she is my least favourite character, but the way the author treated her so unrealistic that I had to stop reading the story.

*Harry with Merlin-Gandalf-Power rangers godlike superpowers; or any OC made on the same way. And look, I mainly search for OC fics... but they need to be at least human for Godsake!

I know exactly what you mean with regards to Lord billionaire Potter. I have a small soft spot for the whole Potter manor trope because James' parents had to live somewhere and I like mansionporn. But it's incredibly annoying when Harry inherits multiple properties/land and walks into the fifteen bedroom Potter manor to find a half dozen cheerful house elves who are all wearing neat little uniforms and overjoyed by his return.

With regards to the money thing though, James/Lily didn't work and planned to just live off James' inheritance, ergo it would be enough for Harry to theoretically do the same (not that he would). It's not like James/Lily knew they were going to die 3 years into the war, and things were bad enough during the first war that Voldemort winning and controlling the wizarding world for 50+ years probably seemed like a realistic outcome.

As someone whose OTP is LV/HP, I just want you to know that I had the misfortune to be drinking water when I read that, and ended up laughing, choking and almost dying. All your fault ;P

Thank you for sharing ;D and I like fics where Harry has a lot of money, but fics where he is Gringotts' richest client, or #3 wealthiest man in England, or wealthier than the Malfoys or something, I find them a bit wayyy overboard. On the other hand, he is a celebrity and his grandparents were both from ancient wealthy families. So it doesn't make sense to me for him to be /middle-class/.
