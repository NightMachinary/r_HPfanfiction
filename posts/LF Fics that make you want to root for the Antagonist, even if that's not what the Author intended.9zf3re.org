Fics where the Main character is just a prick. Whether it's Dumbledore and his "FOR THE GREATER GOOD" but he's not evil honest, he's just doing what he believes is the best, he's really on the side of light, ignore the fact that he's acting like Voldemort. Or whether it's a Harry, or an OC that is more punchable than canon Diddykins, Malfoy, Book 6 Hermione, and Lord Everything Harry combined. I want a fic where the villain is obviously still a villain, but the protagonist is so... UGH, that you think "Mmm, maybe that AU would be better if Voldemort killed everyone, Mercy killings really"

Black Bond for example. Outside of its ridiculous length and the "Slow Burn" Romance of like what, 1.5 million or more words before the listed pairing get together, Acquila Black is an outright bitch for a lot of the fic, and Harry is Fanfiction Ron Bashing Ron level of a twat during Philosophers Stone bit. You really want Acquila to die when reading that fic. What are more examples of just "UGH" protagonists?


** The strongest I felt this was in Harry Potter and the Daft Morons, where I hated the guts of the protagonist and just wanted someone to please assassinate him.

But I felt that way plenty of times in other indie!Harry fics, where the main character is an utter pillock and awful in almost every way, but for some reason he's portrayed as the good guy.

She's a busybody, a chatterbox, and stubbornly rigid in her worldview. Not a great bunch of traits to have when she's also a verified know-it-all at times.

It was a horrible, misogynistic piece of trash that couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a male wank-fantasy or a display on how all women are evil and repress men.... but it had barely any likeable characters and the worldbuilding made no bloody sense. I started skimming through it cause I wanted to see what it did with Luna; Luna's my fave character and the first story in the trilogy made such a BIG deal out of her even though she never avtually appeared, so I wanted to see what she was like.,,, and it turned out that this was a Luna that I just want to STRANGLE.

*** Are you referring to stories that try to make their canon actions seem not that bad, or stories that diverge from canon so that some of those acts are never committed in the first place?

There are people who argue that what Draco did is unforgivable (by the end of the series) and he should be punished with time in Azkaban. But this raises the question, I think, of just how early in the series does Draco become nonredeemable/unforgivable? What is the earliest instance of him doing something that makes the reader think "this guy has lost his chances at redemption, he needs to be punished?"

Draco in his first year doesn't really do anything other than being a dick, and gradually ramps up throughout the series. I think anything prior to 6th year could be forgiven as "you were just a kid who was brainwashed by his insane father", but it becomes much more dubious after that.

Would a fic that diverges from canon around 5th or 6th year so that Draco doesn't attempt his Dumbledore assassination plot be considered whitewashing Draco's actions? Because in this hypothetical fic, Draco doesn't actually commit the heinous acts that are usually brought up as the first/best examples of why he should be punished. Contrast this to a fic that simply follows canon events from Draco's POV to make him seem more unwilling/more forced into it, which would be whitewashing.

It's a similar situation with Snape. What is the earliest event that makes Snape seem nonredeemable? I would argue that the earliest event you could reasonably point to is Snape joining the Death Eaters fresh out of school. But how would Snape be viewed if he didn't make that /specific/ choice? Have him still be interested in Dark Magic, still bigoted against Muggleborns, still an asshole, but never actually join the Death Eaters. I don't think this would count as whitewashing because you aren't trying to explain away his actions; you're removing the actions entirely (which I suppose could be construed as just making a new character altogether, since Snape's early years are a key aspect of his character).

/Methods of Rationality/ (no link) is another author stand-in with an insufferable Harry.

Another is linkffn(4816968), in which Harry is so unlikable that you just hope he'll get struck by a meteor or something. At least you know he'll be a miserable shit into old age who will die alone and unhappy.

**** Not really "transphobia" or "Islamophobia". He bashes religion in general, taking the most recent issues with islam (the fic plays in our time) as a reason to point out the ridiculousness of religion to a powerful wizard. It is also noteworthy that critique of religion's a fundamental Western right, not an illness. Hundreds of years of Enlightenment should allow us to criticise Religions, no matter their members feelings, if they are infringing upon human rights!

I have read the fanfic a few days ago and I cant seem to find anything about him being transphobic. In another of his stories his MC declares that he doesn't care about gay or trans as long as they leave him alone. A rather common position. That is what tolerance is, by definition.

***** He deliberately uses male pronouns to refer to a ‘trans prostitute' as a joke. It's low key but it's still transphobia.

The last three chapters were literally a long rant on how backwards and savage Islam is, and he puts blood curses on mosques. Doesn't matter his stance on the matter, that is by definition islamaphobia. Yes he criticises Christianity but nowhere near the level he does Islam and he doesn't put curses on them.

If you can't see the islamphobia in it then idk it just seems like deliberate ignorance at that stage.

Anyway I just finished reading it and the ending was very rushed and disappointing. Overall had some good points and good writing, but it was abrupt.

****** Wow, that must annoy you a mighty bit, thinking you can judge the authors intention and all that.

I call people He or She until they tell me otherwise, - came with sitting in a gay get-to-gether (I dont know the English word for it) for half a year doing an internship for my social studies.

I don't care if you, who are not meant in that instance, feel insulted in their stead. You know, you should probably learn from Voltaire a bit before you go all ape-war based on a few words that have no real meaning, gender, sexuality and all that lot is private. Private has to stay private. It is nobodies buisness but their own. Hence why I call a person that looks masculine: HE, and a feminine person: SHE, until told otherwise. - This is general respect. Everything else is set-up bigotry without having all the details.

Islam IS like any other religion that is indoctrinating people in institutionalised centres gnawing away at our hard fought for freedoms. The state of law protects religious freedoms but also means that those who practice their religions must accept that we are free to criticize them. It goes both ways.

And lastly, Islam refers to the religion. Catholiszism refers to a religion. Christianity is the mass of people believing in Jesus as their savior. - Just a FYI.

If you, like me, are learning German at the moment, or already speak it or think you can use google translate:[[https://www.kas.de/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=1d9f5939-bd3f-0407-0274-c2a16ef5d563&groupId=252038]]A nice work on the difference between Islamcriticism and Islamophobia

​

Or to say it with the words of Phillip Möller,

#+begin_quote
  Im Prinzip nehmen sich die beiden nicht viel, aber momentan steckt der Islam in der aggressiven und kämpferischen Phase, in der das Christentum auch mal steckte und erst im Zeitalter der Aufklärung gezähmt werden konnte. Und in der Frage, ob ich Gott oder Allah schlimmer finde, könnte die Frage auch lauten, ob ich Stars-Wars-Bösewicht Darth Vader oder Sauron, den Bösen aus „Herr der Ringe“, schlimmer finde: alles reine Fantasie!

  -- In itself both are the same. At the moment Islam is in its aggressive and militant phase, which Christendom has had at one point too - Enlightenment has put a stop to it, though. And about the question what's worse: God or Allah, I think the question is the same as if you were to ask me about who's worse: Darth Vader or Sauron - its fiction, a fantasy, nothing more. (Rough translation).
#+end_quote

I can also offer the words of Michael Schmidt-Salomon

#+begin_quote
  Die Ideologie des falschen Respekts ist, wie ich meine, gleich in mehrfacher Hinsicht schädlich: Erstens verstärkt sie die religiöse Kritikphobie durch das Ausblenden des aversiven Reizes. Zweitens ermutigt sie Fanatiker dazu, noch heftiger zu protestieren, um künftig jede Form von Religionskritik zu unterbinden . Drittens stellt sie weltanschauliche Borniertheit unter "Denk-mal-Schutz", indem sie den Fundamentalisten das "Geschenk der Kritik" vorenthält. Viertens ist sie paradoxerweise besonders respektlos gegenüber den Gläubigen, weil sie diese wie kleine Kinder behandelt, denen man bestimmte Dinge nicht zumuten darf. Fünftens führt sie zu einer Überbetonung der Interessen jener Personenkreise, die in ihrem Denken und Handeln noch nicht im 21. Jahrhundert angekommen sind. Sechstens verführt sie Politiker dazu, das Täter-Opfer-Prinzip umzudrehen, indem sie die Schuld für die Störung des öffentlichen Friedens den betroffenen Künstlern zuweisen -- statt den Fanatikern, die nicht angemessen auf Kritik reagieren können. Siebtens hat die Ideologie des falschen Respekts eine Aushöhlung der Meinungs-, Presse-, Kunst- und Forschungsfreiheit zur Folge. Und achtens ist sie mit dem Verrat der Prinzipien der Streitkultur der Aufklärung verbunden, die ja gerade deshalb so produktiv ist, weil sie Debatten fördert, in denen tradierte Sichtweisen schamlos verletzt werden können. Hüten wir uns also vor der Ideologie des falschen Respekts! Nicht auszudenken, wo wir heute stünden, wenn die Aufklärer der Vergangenheit größere Rücksicht auf religiöse Gefühle genommen hätten: Womöglich würden in Europa noch immer die Scheiterhaufen brennen...

  -- The ideology of false respect is, or so I think, destructive in multiple ways: firstly, it strengthens religious critiquephobia(hard to translate that tbh) by ignoring the aversive appeal. Secondly, it encourages fanatics to protest even more to, in the future, prevent any other criticism. Thirdly, it gives the worldview of narrow-mindedness some sort of "monumental protection", by ways of protecting fundamentalists from receiving the gift of criticism. Fourthly,\\
  it is paradoxically especially lacking in respect towards religious people by acting as if they needed protection, as if they were children that need to be protected from harm. Fiftly, it leads to an overemphasis of the interests of one group of people, who in their thinking and acting have yet to arrive in the 21th century. Sixtly, it seduces politicians to reverse the offender-victim principle, by means of declaring that the guilt for the Disturbance of public peace lays with those that criticise and not with those that can't handle criticism. Seventhly, the ideology of false respect is an erosion of freedom of opinion, speech, art, sciene, press (etc.). And eightly, it is treason towards the principle of the culture of debate and enlightenment. A culture that is productive because it requires us to debate, - it is productive because it shows off outdated views/ideas that need to be disrespected! I cant imagine where we would be/stand today, if people had such a protection from criticism a few hundred years ago. We would most likely burn at the stake. (rough translation again)

******* Idk man, referring to someone who identifies as a woman as ‘he' is transphobic to its very core. It's a deliberate misgendering of someone who has told them otherwise. And saying ‘he she or it' is really iffy at best. (In context of the story, it was casual transphobia and completely unnecessary to the story imo. Regardless of author intent, it was something that made me dislike the character while I read it, which was the point of my initial post).

We'll have to agree to disagree on the Islamaphobia part. I don't think advocating for genocide or actively killing someone for their religion (or cursing them, as it were) counts as criticism. I think that plants itself firmly in the ‘phobia' side of things. Noting that I'm not religious in any way; Harry also hates the Middle East and Africa as a whole in this story, which arguably dips into general racism as well.

Anyway, the point l was making with my initial post is that it was a story featuring an annoying protagonist, and those were stand out parts of what made the character irritating for me.

Oh yes, the MC is really annoying, but that comes with thinking one is a superior being, despite clear fallacious failures in personality and foresight. - Especially the phallus-cultism the author has built around himself, (Veelas eg), is a strong indicator for personality-issues.

********* So the context was Sirius asking to go to Las Vegas and Harry said ‘if you get drunk and marry a transgender prostitute I promise not to bother he or she or it'. Given that Sirius is portrayed as 100% straight, the implication is that he marries a trans woman and then finds out she's trans after the fact. Like I've said before, it's minor and it's casual but it was enough to make me cringe which is why I mentioned it.

In context, it seems blatantly transphobic to me. I understand that maybe different life experiences mean that we would read into things differently, but the casual transphobia and what I perceive as racism is what made the character particularly intolerable for me. The superiority complex and heteronormative cult worship of his penis are definitely aspects of it, as are casual implications of rape-like-behaviour (i.e. the Joining, morally ambiguous at best, sexual coercion at worst). Personally, that's how I read it and that's why I mentioned it. Good to have this discussion and interesting to hear about how other people read it!

********** I can't say that I see it like that. Since we do not know what the supposed transgender identifies at, to stay on track, we cannot know if they prefer he, she or it.

To you it is transphobic because you apparently want it to be transphobic. Your level of acceptance is different than mine, or that of any other person, which is fine. But you cannot expect people to think, feel, or reason the same way you do. Passing judgement, because of one owns feelings is therefore always something that should happen in private. Feelings are rarely a good source for reasoning, I think.

If the Harry in the story of Noodlehammer would have underwent an actual process that lead him to become who he was, - a process we could have followed by reading about it. We may would have come to understand him better. - We may even would have accept his behavior as direct consequence of what has happened to him. But since we are lacking clear trigger moments for change in Harry Potters behavior, we can only conclude that the author is suggestively self-inserting his own personality and wishful thinking into the MC/Harry Potter.

That was the impression I got but correct me if I'm wrong!). And regardless of gender identity, referring to a human being as ‘it' is incredibly rude and dehumanising no matter what their gender identity is.

To me it is transphobic because flubbing pronouns and using ‘it' is a frequently used technique of people who ‘don't believe in transgenderism' or some other similar sentiment to dehumanise or make fun of trans people. Even if the author didn't mean it like that, that is how it comes across. Anyway, we clearly will have to agree to disagree on this one too.

Racism and transphobia were what tipped the MC from ‘irritating' to ‘unbearable, I wish he'd be hit by a cannon ball' for me. It's fine if you didn't read it that way, because perspectives are often nuanced by whoever is reading it, but that's my input on the topic of annoying main characters and why they annoyed me.

*** Admittedly it's been a long time since I read this one, but I felt like that wasn't the point. It seemed like tyrants with power needed to be constrained turned eventually into everyone with power needed to be constrained -- so instead of allowing progress the "2nd group" turned to restricting everyone to the lowest common denominator, effectively resorting to slavery of anyone with more power than the weakest of the pack.

It wasn't a world with clearcut right and wrong. We saw a very biased side of things due to the PoV followed which I'm sure colors how the reader interprets it, but the ending brought to light even more questions about which group was "correct".

**** I agree on all points. Now, if only the fanfic were half as nuanced about it.

** Pick any fic with the tag "Independent!Harry" or similar.

Also, Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution. The protagonists are vile, bloothrirsty and manage to be a lot more evil than the antagonists, and yet we're supposed to be on their side.
