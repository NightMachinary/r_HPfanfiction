** linkffn(Saving Conner) looked like it was going this way, but then it took a left turn when Snape and Draco befriend Harry and lead him away from the brainwashing his (living) parents and Dumbledore put him through. It's very Super!Harry but also epic length and covers 7 books. A good read.

** I've only read one of these, but I'm drawing a blank at the name. I remember Harry does some anime thing where he pokes his brother in the head or something like that. Someone else probably knows the name of it, since I recall it being pretty well-known.
