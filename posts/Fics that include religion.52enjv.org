or cults

I'm not looking for a fic advocating one religion or the other, just one that includes religion in it. Prince of the Dark Kingdom has some nice touches on paganism for example. Or maybe even a fic with a religious cult, or a religious war.

There is so much that could be done religion and I've not seen much of it other than that horrific mormon Lockhart fic. Just writing this request is giving me ideas.

Edit: I didn't really mean abrahamic religions, I kinda wanted wizarding or ancient religions. I feel like fics with modern religions in would be controversial and would probably make me uncomfortable due to not being able to relate.

** It seems like there was a whole website of stories where Snape became a Christian and underwent a complete personality transplant similar to a pod person? He insisted on being called Brother Severus, even by the students? I wonder if that's still up, you might get a few chuckles out of it, as they all follow the exact same plot.... It seems like one of the stories was called 'Oh My Soul'? I'll do a bit of poking around later, see if I can find it for you.

** linkffn(8233291)

Main character is an OC, twin sister of the boy who lived. And while the Potters survived Halloween, they proceeded to leave her with the Dursleys. This does not result in a particularly good childhood.

Anyways, she worships the personification of Death, Baron Samedi. There are 13 other gods like him, each with a domain - totaling 7 Light, and 7 Dark. [[/spoiler][A bit more than worships, to be honest - she's a Voodoo practitioner, which means that Death owns her soul, and she gets some abilities in return. The ability to perform human sacrificial rituals, for instance.]]

linkffn(7406866)

I also feel obligated to recommend To The Stars, even though it isn't a Harry Potter fanfic (instead being PMMM). Set ~450 years after the end of PMMM [[/spoiler][and Madoka's rewriting of history/editing of the universe]], 20 years after Magical Girls are revealed to the public [[/spoiler][thanks to their intervention in an alien attack on a human colony world]], it follows a newly contracted Magical Girl from Earth. One of the main plot threads is her involvement with "The Cult of Hope", a religion for Magical Girls by Magical Girls, and the only religion to be growing in the year 2460. [[/spoiler][And a religion that can actually back up it's claims with evidence, thanks to the frequent visions the ascended Madoka grants.]] No prior exposure to PMMM is required to follow along with the plot.

** There's one that I became fond of but its still a WIP and a crossover. Basically /Harry Potter/ meets /Charmed/ and how the Charmed ladies use magic is in fact related to how the HP universe does magic. In /Charmed/ wiccan spells and powers are real and it just seems like an interesting thing to mash up with HP.

Managed to find the thing linkffn(2272234). WARNING: Read at own risk! Hasn't been updated since 2005! I'm only linking it as proof that I didn't imagine it.

The /concept/ is sound even if there's a lot of old tropes and weird stuff with cannon in there.

** I used to think that religion was an odd thing to implement in Harry Potter, even though I'm Catholic myself, but think about it - horcruxes mean that people have souls and if you have a soul then there's a god of some sort, and so a heaven an hell as well? Even in the last book Harry winds up in some sort of purgatory-like place after dying.

**** To argue about this, we'd need to answer 'what is the soul?'

'Soul' is an inherently religious idea, but not all religions claim there are souls. Buddhism, for example, says there is no self and so there is no soul. In religions that claim souls exists, there is always a story of the divine origin of the soul.

Rowling does not directly mention religion at all within her story, and she didn't come up with a new religion explaining the soul. What the reader is left with is the inference that some religion out there got it right, all of them claiming the soul has divine origin.

Or, you know, none of them is right. In the universe of HP, when we only look at what we are told, the afterlife is merely a different state of existence. We know there are souls, but there is absolutely no reason to believe they are part of something divine. One could also argue that they are a natural occurrence within this universe and god was never needed for it.

In the real world the soul is a spiritual idea, true (and even there the chance that one human-made ideology hits the mark is almost nil, should it turn out souls exist). But we are speaking about a made up universe that only has a striking similarity with our real one. One may explore this universe however he deems fit, but I for one prefer a Occam's razor approach.

** The wizards in my story "Patron" revere the Old (pagan) gods - or what they think are the old gods - with a few rituals described in scenes. Although most are not really religious, the return to the pagan gods was more a "screw you" aimed at Christian Witch hunters. Some groups take it more seriously, though, and and there's a sect as well.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  It's funny how the world works. There are too many things near and dear to us for a wand to be drawn at every occasion. Everyone has a story, and the lines and points come together to form a web of something too ephemeral to measure. Harry thinks that the strands are snapping a bit too quickly. A rewrite of The Wizard of the Kaleidoscope. Added to the DLP Library.

** If you don't mind crossovers (and somewhat unfinished stories - there are two or three complete books, a chapter or two long omake, and a start of another bookbthat hasn't been updated for years), there's a bunch of religion-related magic in linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) which is a Harry Potter and Dresden Files crossover. As someone who has literally no idea what the Dresden Files was before starting the fanfic, I found the stories a great read full of non-canon magic, characters, and lore.
