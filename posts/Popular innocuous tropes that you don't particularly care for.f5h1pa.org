What are some silly tropes that perhaps annoy you or just make you laugh when you read them? I'm not talking serious tropes like Weasley!bashing, just innocuous stuff that pops up a lot.

For me, it would be that Harry (or other character especially Seekers) is jacked just because he plays Quidditch. First the whole idea that everyone who plays Quidditch at Hogwarts (a school full of kids) has the body of an MMA fighter is hilarious to me. Sure they're probably fairly strong verses the kids doing nothing because it involves a bit of core strength and leg strength to stay upright on a broomstick, and probably some arm strength for the Beaters and for throwing for the Chasers. But they're still just /kids/ flying around on broomsticks.

Ok back to Harry he's good at his position from the start because he is lighter and scrawnier than everyone else and is good at flying. Why would he suddenly have huge arms, abs and pecs just because he flies faster than other people, if anything it would make him slower and worse at his position.

Yes I know everyone wants hot boyz in their smut but I swear it's always someone drooling over their "Quidditch toned body" which just makes no sense lol. Actually the whole super jock/Quidditch Bro thing just makes me laugh in general (poor wizards only having one sport to play lol). So yeah you write that in your story, I laugh, sorry.

What are some others?


** Hogwarts letters coming on the eleventh birthday. That's not a thing. It comes in late July/early August. Harry's came on his eleventh birthday because he was a summer birthday anyway and even then it was supposed to come earlier, it just took Hagrid a few days to deal with the Dursley nonsense. That does not mean everyone gets their Hogwarts letter the day they turn eleven. It would no sense (even by wizards standards) for them to do that!

“Hey 31 August birthday kid, you have 24 hours to buy all your shit and get on the train. Hope you're not Muggleborn and your parents know Side-Along Apparition. Fuck you.”

“Hey 2 September birthday kid, here's your letter but you gotta wait a whole year before you actually get to go. Sure, go ahead and buy your wand and run around unsupervised and uneducated with it for a full year, but I wouldn't buy your defense books just yet. Fuck you.”

** Parseltongue being an actual learnable language, rather than a purely magical ability. When Harry speaks it, it sounds like English in his head--that's not how real languages work. Maybe someone could copy the hissing noise (Ron does in canon to get the basilisk fang in book 7), but I don't think that would give them the ability to talk to snakes--snakes don't ordinarily have the capacity for language, and it makes more sense that a real Parselmouth talking to them just magically gives them some sort of sentience/ability to communicate.

*** That is absolutely how languages work. My mother language was german, but then I learned english. By now, I think in english, dream in english, and don't have to translate back and forth. The language just means what it means, german is german but english is english, and I understand their meanings just the same.

When you reach a level of proficiency like this, there's no difference in language anymore, is what I'm getting at. For example:

"Du Hurensohn"

and

"You son of a bitch"

mean the same thing, and their meaning is what is important. What Harry means is that he understands the meaning of the language, not that parseltongue is translated into english inside his head. Because that's cheap, and not how language works.

But Parseltongue is translated to English in his head in the books--he doesn't realize he's speaking/hearing a different language than English until Ron points it out to him after the dueling club. "I spoke a different language? But - I didn't realize - how can I speak a language without knowing I can speak it?" -Harry, in CoS. That's why it's different from being fluent a real language--you'd never not be able to tell whether someone was speaking German or English to you.

*** I think this is based on James supposedly being pureblood, and pureblood wood necessitate it to be a very old family, at least through the male line. Old families who have lots of old money (as Harry is shown to be at least “very well off”) often have (at least distant) ties to royalty of some type. As such I think there might be a “lord potter” at least historically, and with the antiquated nature of the wizard of world, wouldnt surprise me if he still did. Griffindoor I can KIND of see, because if the sword thing and I think at some point someone said griffindoor had some ties to a peverel (also he is the male descendent of the only peverell brother to walk away alive, so that lordship could be there too). You can bullshit slytherin enough because of the parsletoung and “conquest” and black bc serious, but HOW THE HELL DO PEOPLE GIVE THE GUY EVERY OTHER TITLE KNOWN TO MAN?!?!

The worst version I have seen of this is when he was working on the wolfsbane potion after breakfast before classes and that made his hair greasy, while before breakfast as all Slytherins confirm his hair was not greasy. I mean, he could work on the potion first and wash his hair afterwards, but no this potion has to be brewed after breakfast.

And I love Snape with all my heart but people just have to accept his hair or come up with better explanations.

I can't really think of any that don't also have Harry doing physical training to prepare for war.

I always find it amusing when Snape (my favorite character and i love him) is described as having really nice arms and shoulders from stirring potions and carrying cauldrons. I can buy it that him being a spy he might keep himself in shape under those robes because he needs to keep being a good dueler and possibly need the physical strength to get out of certain situations, but I don't think making potions really leads to building muscle even more so than quidditch!

*** In the TV show M/A/S*H one of the antagonist characters is constantly called ferret-face because he's a snitch and has a narrow, pinched face.

Since MASH was on in the 70s and 80s, I could see Harry having seen reruns and calling Malfoy ferret-face, especially after the year 4 incident, but MASH is also an irreverent American sitcom, so I can't actually quite picture the Dursleys letting it stay on tv.

The constant arching seems a little bit more excessive than the grooming, but I think that can be explained away as either arrogance or upbringing. Especially when we see Lucius arch his brow a fair bit in the movies too (can't remember if he is noted to in the books, but I wouldn't be surprised).

*** I'd say that in a formal setting, depending on where you draw inspiration from for the high wizarding class, it's not necessarily out of place to use titles. Eg, if you're being formal, I'd expect 'Lord/Lady/Baron/other title (Name of Family or title)' to be the norm if drawing from the british aristocracy.

Obviously in less formal settings, that might be excessive - though I seem to recall that in earlier times the peerage might be more associated with their titles than with their actual name (eg, the Baron of Guernsey might just be called 'Guernsey' in normal conversation even if his given name and family name were completely different).

But yeah, Hermione being called like that should really only happen if someone is trying to lift her spirits or she's depressed.

******* I'm Austrian, and I switched to a BHS for /Oberstufe/. It's possible the teachers at the old school would have offered a choice also, I don't know, but at the BHS that's just how it was.

Perhaps ironically that's also where I had teachers that didn't want to be called "Professor Last name"; I had one teacher named "Schirmherr" f.e. whom we called "Schirmi", and my class teacher was "Frau Traudel". I had bizarre conversations like "Can you please sketch your solution on the blackboard and solve the integral, Herr Maier?" - "Sure, Schirmi".

Other teachers were the opposite, like "Kommerzialrat Professor Dr. Steurer", who demanded to be called that each time. I've changed the names somewhat because some of the people still teach there.

And I expect (I could be wrong here) that groundbreaking discoveries are hard to come by in static subjects (unless you're researching cross species breeding or something) and prodigies/geniuses are more common in the dynamic ones. I figured herbology would involve an interest in the subject and a lot of hard work than innate talent. Sprout was a Hufflepuff and herbology required hard work and a nurturing mindset.

** The smirks, scoffs and sneers.

Nobody smirks, scoffs or sneers that much, or that hard. A sneer is actually the sort of grimace your gran would tell you not to pull, because it really does get stuck to your face.

Don't forget that those are the only three emotions they can show, the only other being a neutral face.

Sneering, scoffing and smirking make you look either dumb or ugly, depending on what you're going for. Most people have much more open faces. They laugh and frown and smile and wink and waggle or furrow their eyebrows.

The Transfiguration Courtyard is a great place to practice spells seen in class and the chest beside the fountain is filled with varying things to practice Transfiguration while taking some air and sun. The Music Room is on the second floor but still close to the Great Hall and is a great spot to socialise and get to meet people from other houses. Finally, their abandoned classroom is more often used between Dinner and curfew and serves as a middle point between Dungeon One and Ravenclaw Tower.

  For me, it would be that Harry (or other character especially Seekers) is jacked just because he plays Quidditch.

In the same vein: I find it funny when they start serious fitness training/ diet when they are like 12. Like- all of them are thin so they don't need to lose weight and no matter how much muscle they have they'd still be overpowered by an average adult. What's even funnier is that physical fitness =/= magical power. Voldemort, while crazy, was in top form in his late 60s/ early 70s and Dumbledore was still very powerful and capable of dueling well in his 100s. Hell, even Slughorn, who is described as rotund and is at least in his 70s, took part in the Battle at Hogwarts. So it's not even like all the training in the world will make Harry and co. more magically powerful/ knowledgeable.

Now, I'm not saying people shouldn't train and stay healthy. Of course they should. I just find it funny when healthy, thin children and teenagers decide they "need" to train. Children run around and play- that's their exercise. And schools have a Physical Education class regardless.

*** While you're right, that physical fitness shouldn't and in canon does not equal magical strength, I've most often seen it used as an embracing of muggle fighting styles. That is, being physically fit allows you to react quickly to oncoming spellfire, and dodge, move in unexpected ways, etc. Your point about kids just being kids, however, is spot on. It's not until your mid to late teens that you really need to start training with any amount of specificity. Even in sports, generally before that time period, kids are either good or they aren't; it's a natural gift that they don't really work on that much.

** I have a lot of pet peeves accrued from my years of reading Severitus.

The one that is probably the most innocuous compared to my immense loathing is the way people describe Snape's home, quarters, or clothes as being giant epiphany moments for Harry in realizing Snape is a human being. Stop acting like it's high philosophy to discover a former death eater owns a T-shirt or a cream couch. One would assume this is just Harry being a stupid kid, but in my experience it is always too overwrought for that to explain it. The authors really seem to think we'll be equally surprised when we read their grand vision of what color Snape's walls are painted. Like we'll be fucking shocked at the unknown depths of a man that paints his walls navy. It's particularly bad, but also common, when the described accommodations are /girly./ In all truth, a good number of people think far more about message than about who Snape actually is, and it's obvious.

But the very, very worst examples have Snape's home decked out in Gryffindor colors in an attempt to look even more artificially "deep".

Lastly, this whole series is living off of the idea of camp being taken seriously so I have no idea why people are so averse to letting Snape dress like a wizard. Most stories I read hardly allow him to wear robes at all.

We all know he has terrible stringy pale chicken arms and legs under those robes, so stop being so eager to show them off! Joking here, but only in part...

I mentioned this in my response to the "stop pretending Snape washes his hair" comment, but I have to reiterate: I am really tired of people being too shallow to let less desirable character traits be. Snape doesn't wash his hair or brush his teeth. He literally spits when he yells. He is unpleasant in a variety of ways, and people need to stop these ridiculous standards where characters that are not hot enough are not allowed in stories unchanged.

Also... The bizarre ubiquitousness of "magical cores" (in reference to the human being rather than the wand) fucking rankles. Why is a fandom built off of such creative worldbuilding so shackled to this one stupid noncanonical concept? I literally have to force myself to keep reading when I hear that stupid term no matter how good the fic is. THINK OF YOUR OWN MAGIC THEORIES FOR ONCE!!!!!!

Because it's a ubitiquous term in the fandom for that sort of magic. Personally I like the appeal of magic being limited by something more than just willpower and concentration - and find that having that sort of physical aspect to be a good inclusion if handled correctly. Yes, it's digging a bit more into the mechanics of magic, and not everyone will like that - but at the same time, there's people like me who like that sort of fleshing out the system.

Obviously a lot of bad fics use it just as a way to power up Harry quickly, but that's not the fault of the concept. And in some ways, it fits quite well into the world - a developing 'magical core' can explain why schooling starts so late, why spells can tire people out and aren't overused, play into how the wand is used as a conduit, etc.

***** I can certainly see why people might have issues with it and how it's normally handled - I just disagree with the casual dismissal of it entirely. Usually the way people seem to talk about it is like it's the absolute worst idea ever, and that canon's complete lack of explanations along those lines is much better for everyone - which I disagree with.

For instance, the way it's used/worked in 'With Strength of Steel Wings' is very well done, IMO, and fits much better than not having magical cores or a concept similar to it.

**** Cool, so, this one is less a pet peeve than an outright criticism:

A lot of people just don't seem to understand that misanthropic people like Snape don't change their ways all at once. You could give him the biggest, most impactful revelation in the world that Harry is not his father and instead an abused child, and it still wouldn't make him suddenly lose all his habits. His treatment of Harry is not only in misunderstanding but in a negative personality trait of Snape's. It will not change like flipping a light switch.

Snape either decided in weakness or learned from his father long ago that other people's comfort is not as important as his need to vent his depression/anger/frustration/etc. This means that he is very set in the habit of using people as sort of emotional punching bags whenever he needs to let off steam. Keep in mind that years-ingrained habits /are not easy to break/, especially when they are part of any sort of coping method. Snape will struggle for some time with the impulse to insult Harry, especially in times of stress.

Snape may not even know how to deal with stress in any other way (this depends on where in his life you decide the mindset came from). I'm not sure how this would play out in a /Harry Potter/ setting given Snape's sparse social life, but in real life the unfortunate reality is that many misanthropes attempting to rehabilitate just shift their ire to a different target. I say this less to tell you to manufacture a situation like this and more as an example of ways this can go wrong.

All of this also means that if you want to make Snape look like a shockingly different man outside of Harry's perspective, giving him a flourishing social life wherein he wears argyle sweaters whilst the neighborhood children swing off his arms calling him "Unky Sev" is barking up the wrong tree. Sorry to say I'm talking about a very real fic and not actually using hyperbole.

You can kind of avoid this issue if you retcon Snape's personality a bit, but if you do, MAKE IT OBVIOUS that you are consciously retconning. If you publish on such a lovely place as potionsandsnitches.org, you can do this simply by adding the OOC Snape flavor tag.

Most of my pet peeves are not things I'd expect from someone that would ask for help. I'll list two more anyway though. I have to admit that the moment anyone asks me a question like this I tend to forget everything; even telling people my birthday is a struggle sometimes... So there would be more, I just can't think of it.

You may feel the impulse to make other characters look bad in order to make Snape look better by comparison. Resist it. This tactic is always obvious and in a way manipulative, though not always scorned as a good subset of the fanbase does love bashing. The reverse of this is making people like the Malfoys better than they're supposed to be-- also a bit gross.

If you are someone that really /does/ feel strongly that Dumbledore, for example, is just totally terrible and absolutely must write that into your story, express that by letting your characters stay at their canon characterization and then naturally come to a different realization rather than just retconning everyone's feelings towards the man. Like I said, rewriting history to fit your view just feels manipulative.

Lastly, a lot of authors make Snape warm up to James' memory in order to give Harry the best possible Snape-led upbringing, one that includes positivity towards both his biological parents. I feel that this is deeply unrealistic. Do not forget how intensely Snape's hatred of James burned, how it alone was enough for him to deeply hate Lily's only child.

As for encountering it, it's usually after he's finished some nutri potion regime, gains some height, and broadens his shoulder due to finnaly having a correct growth.

** When the author mess up their own timeline, or when they don't have a clear vision of the scene in their head, for example: a scene is described as two people sitting across each orher in a restaurant with a table in between then, but the author later (during the same dinner) describes a scene where he puts his arm around her back or some other thing not possible when sitting facing each other

*** Yes! Screwing up timelines or not being clear about timelines really annoys me. I've read stories where it's 2 years after the war but Harry is 25 or whatever and i just can't focus on how the rest is the story is because I'm taken out of the fantasy by bad details.

**** Right?!!! JK actually does this in the series, in the 1st AND 3rd book someone comments that Gryffindor doesn't win the quidditch cup for 7 years(this exact number in both books), not since Charlie was part of the team

(Don't know if this mistake appears in every edition, but in the one that I read, there's this small error in timeline lol)

***** Not disputing your opinion, but I think they said they've not win the house cup for 7 years, rather than the quidditch cup.

** Honestly, maybe the quidditch body is exaggerated, but I can really believe it takes quite a bit of core, leg, and arm strength to stay on the broom. They go pretty fast on those things and air resistance can be a bitch.

What DOES annoy me, on that matter, is how scrawny malnourished kids like Harry can go the speed they do, because I'd think that the strength training is necessary to actually do such a thing.

*** I would expect a magic flying broom to have some magic that deals with wind resistance and inertial dampening. Sure, pushing it to the limit would make it less effective, but I doubt they're flying around at 100mph and getting hit with 100mph winds, and then pulling 15G turns and getting hit by 15Gs.

** Fics where Harry isn't the BWL. I know, I know, people like them, but you know how many characters in Harry Potter aren't the BWL? All of them except Harry! Just write the fic about another character!
