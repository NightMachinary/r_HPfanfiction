So, I can't be the only one that loves when the Chamber has secrets beyond just the basilisk. The name of that book was rather misleading when written by Rowling as there was only one secret that was moved forward by a plot device. There were 2 secrets revealed and the "Tom Riddle is Lord Voldemort" secret could have been revealed in any part of the castle or on the grounds, but it had to be in the Chamber to reveal the bigger secret of "there's a giant, ancient snake that can kill with a look".


** Well, the Chamber's sheer existence is a salient point, I think. It's a room within Hogwarts that only one person can access (in theory), a perfect hideout for /anything/. I have the headcanon that its enchantments are separate from the Castle and controlled by the Heir, allowing them to Apparate to and from the Chamber, too.

*** If only it was revisited in Half-Blood Prince. I mean, Harry was seeing that Riddle was a half-blood through the memories with Dumbledore so he might have thought the book belonged to him as well as and maybe there was something hidden there. I mean, it would have made more sense to find the Diadem in the Chamber since both held a special connection for Tom: the Chamber for his blood of Slytherin and the diadem because it belonged to a Founder. Instead, it's in the RoR which makes no sense as we never saw Riddle go there and only had a tie-in when Harry had to stash the Half-Blood Prince's book.

**** I thought there was a line in one of Harry's conversations with Hermione about the the Prince where she suggested it might be Riddle's book and Harry dismisses it 'cause Voldemort is the least likely person to name themself "Half-blood".

It could have made sense for a Horcrux to be there.

***** I think you're right about Tom not wanting to advertise that he was a half-blood as it would hurt his cause. It's been a while since I've read the books so I couldn't remember.

**** The diadem wasn't in the chamber because the diary was already connected to the chamber and he wouldn't risk connecting two horcruxes like that, after all if it was in the chamber it might have been found far earlier.

The chamber didn't lay waiting until Tom came along. Basically every Gaunt has been there. The place was likely raided a long time ago for anything Slytherin left behind. After all if you were going to leave a place forever why leave things you want behind? The chamber itself is now likely nothing more than a great place to do things... in secret.

Also of note that pottermore link contains hilarious information. Until the wizards copied muggles with the creation of toilets they would just shit wherever they happened to be at the time.

**** I think I prefer the theory I saw in a fic, that wizards have always had "modern plumbing," by having ruins on the taps/toilets that conjured water, and ruins on the drain to vanish it (and waste), and that the bathrooms were only upgraded in appearance over time. Also that the pipes were put there by Slytherin rather than having plumbing large enough to fit a giant fuck off snake in it.

*** And I'd get it if there was more than one snake. It was more of a snake room. We didn't see what laid beyond Salazar's mouth, it was never re-visited until the final battle where Ron, who's not a Parselmouth, opened the Chamber by hissing at it.

** The actual purpose of the Chamber of Secrets may have been something different from its modern name. Salazar is a basque name, and one of the figures from basque mythology is Sugaar, a serpent deity that lives in a cave and comes out to father storms on the goddess of the weather. Having a cave with a dirty great big snake in it might well have been of significant mystical and/or magical importance to a basque wizard. I mean, OK, I'm pretty sure JKR didn't realise the origins of the name she picked (she says she got it from the portuguese dictator) but by a series of happy accidents it fits really, really well that he'd build a snake temple underground.

** Meh, at this point it has become a bit of a cliche to have all kinds of undiscovered secrets in the chamber besides the basilisk. I actually find it more refreshing now to have characters explore the chamber and be disappointed at not finding anything special than them finding the Slytherin study and portrait for the umpteenth time.

*** It is a cliche, but that's because it adds extra to the Chamber. I mean, it was a Chamber of /Secerts/. Plural, meaning more than one. Only secret we got was that there was a giant snake in the castle.

**** I'd at least appreciate it if there was some originality into the supposed secrets. A portrait of Slytherin helping Harry complete rituals and directing him towards a library of Parselmagic can hardly be considered exciting anymore. Not saying those plot points are necessarily bad or anything, just that they've become commonplace.

Then we're reminded that it's been over 1000 years so everything has decayed away to dust and/or anything that might have been useful has been looted by Riddle or smashed by the largest basilisk on record.
