Originally meant to be a crack fic, this fic is one of the best and longest I've ever read. There's no tropes really, just Gordon Ramsay. Yes, Gordon Ramsay ala MasterChef jr. The premise of the fic is that, instead of Slughorn, Potions is taken over by Gordon Ramsay during sixth year. There's drama, a cooking competition, Ron being a good person, just a lot of good stuff. I'm still waiting for Ramsay to call Dumbledore an idiot sandwich, though. It's based on a tumblr thread which the author linked I believe.


** Just going to point out that around the halfway point, the fic takes a sharp turn from being a crack fic about Gordon Ramsey in Harry Potter to a serious fic about war crimes in Harry Potter.

Both halves were worth reading, but the tonal shift was jarring, and I think it's best for the reader to have a rough idea of what they're getting into.

  Inspired by a post on Tumblr, this is a AU story set during Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts, with one big, foul-mouthed difference. Instead of Horace Slughorn, the position of Potions professor will be taken on by...Gordon Ramsay.

** The premise seemed interesting, but when Gordon confronted Snape in chapter 3, and then the professor conference in chapter 4, it just felt like the author was using the character as a mouthpiece and I lost interest.

**** there is also the fact that it sticks to the stations of canon to an insane degree even though things should have changed

ron leaves in the horcrux hunt, even though in this timeline he should be way more confident and self assured

***** The author likely isn't the most creative person, that's what usually causes this. The inability or unwillingness to change anything and the usage of Gordon as an author mouthpiece instead of a real part of the world are just indications of this.

****** the trans charcter is a good example of that

they are less of a charcter and more of a way for the author to express the views they have on that issue in a real ham fisted way

** I saw this fic recommended on this sub a while ago and read the whole thing in a couple of days...it's amazingly good for what I thought would be more of a crackfic. Highly recommend it!
