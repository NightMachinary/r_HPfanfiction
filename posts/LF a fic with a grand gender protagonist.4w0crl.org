** So, I'm 100% certain I read one that was okay but I can't find it. I'm digging around, but I thought I'd leave this link to a thread I dug up during my search.

** So, I'm sure I read one. Harry, MtF, and she ends up with Snape in a D/s relationship. I liked it okay while I was reading it but the character at the end was so different from Harry (litterally a barefoot, pregnant, catholic housewife) that I found it off-putting. But I can't find it so that's moot.

I did find this while I was digging. Maybe it'll be helpful.

EDIT: So unless anyone has any ideas on how to find what I was reading on 05/30, which is when I read that fic, I'm never going to be able to find it.

** Session Transcripts has a transman Hermione, who identifies as Hermes. It is a very beautiful story, and was one of the first stories I read where Snape was actually a good guy. linkffn(7508449)

Red Headed Stepchild has Harry as a transwoman, identifying as Harriet, iirc. The plot includes her being trans, but isn't solely about that, [[/spoiler][it also includes a violent muggleborn uprising against blood purist bigots, and against a Ministry who is all too happy to enable the bigtory.]] I believe the author of this story is on this sub, but I don't remember offhand whether their reddit name is identical to their FFN name. linkffn(9037058)

  What happens when a brain damaged Harry and a transgender Hermione both get sorted into Slytherin? Snape's not sure, but he thinks it's likely to be an interesting term. This story follows various first years through the trials of their first year.

  After a good and long life Harry has finally died. Except that as always he's a trouble magnet and instead of dying he finds himself in yet another impossible situation. Really, he's eternally going to be "The-Boy-Who-Lived-To-Conquer-Death"
