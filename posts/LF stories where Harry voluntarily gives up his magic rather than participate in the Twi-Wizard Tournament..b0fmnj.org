#+begin_quote
  When Harry's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire Dumbledore gives him a choice. Either participate in the tournament or lose his magic and leave Hogwarts. The Headmaster would never have guessed that Harry would lash out angrily and choose the latter. Minor Ron and Dumbledore bashing at the start. Wizarding War on a quicker timescale than in canon. H/Hr. My first FanFic. Complete.

** Magic being taken away is purely fanon.

My headcannon is that you can't take away magic from a wizard as part of them. Let's say a person living in the world today gets kidnapped to some shady place. He gets really sick and doesn't get the healthcare he needs.

He'll die (most likely), as his body has grown reliant on all the medicines and whatnot.

On the other hand, you have, say, a person who hasn't had healthcare for a really long time getting sick. His body is most probably more suited with this kind of thing, and he'll recover in no time.

You see? This goes the same way for magic. It's like our blood, it's in our blood, but not really. Yeah, it might be genes, but I think magic is just a sentient being that favours those who have wizarding parents. Where does magic come from? Who really knows indeed.

But this is purely my headcannon. I just needed to get it out there...

*** In that case, what would have been the repercussions in canon if Harry had refused to participate?

**** The repercussions were never really specified in canon beyond "binding magical contract." I feel that he would've been expelled or arrested and thrown in prison for breaking the contract. That is, the consequences were legal rather than magical.

******* Implied is not the same as explicitly expressed. What you read as an implication can easily be interpreted differently by somebody else.

Without anything explicitly written, all we have is guesswork.
