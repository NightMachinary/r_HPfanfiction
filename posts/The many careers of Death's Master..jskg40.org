His name is Harry James Potter. As he finds out, being reborn/functionally immortal can be very boring, and even the most exciting careers get boring after a few decades. As such, Harry has pursued many titles and job descriptions over the years. He can tack to the end of his name any number of honorifics and acronyms; MD, DVM, PhD, JD, Master Chief Petty Officer, US Navy (Ret), and the list goes on. His resume is long enough and detailed enough to be bound into an encyclopedia set about careers and job descriptions.

  What if that night in Godric's Hollow went differently? What if Harry did die? What if Death stepped in and made a deal with the Savior of the Wizarding World? How different would Harry's life be after that deal?(Or, Harry makes a deal with Death and in exchange gains something Voldemort has fought his entire life for. Immortality. And a strange friendship with Death)
