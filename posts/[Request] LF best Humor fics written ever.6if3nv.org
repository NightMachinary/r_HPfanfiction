  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

** Adding my favorite:

Linkffn(Potter Ever After): A parody of fanfic trops where Harry (and a few other characters) becomes aware that he's in a fanfic and openly discusses wgat's happening.

Highlights include Harry and Ron talking about Ron!Bashing, Dumbledore explaining what the hero's journey is and McGonagal joining the Death Eaters to get more screentime.

Also [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7079665][Slytherin Career Day]] is, as you'd think, about a Slytherin Career Day.

  Between marriage contracts, soul bonds, angry fathers, wandering eyes, backstabbing women, and defiant house elves, Harry has a feeling that 'True Love' isn't in the cards for him in this story. Which is just fine by him, as it turns out. A depressing walkthrough of the current state of HP Fanfiction.

** Honestly the fic that made me laugh the hardest is not one of the classics. It was a crack fic released maybe in 2005 or perhaps even earlier. I remember very little about it - mainly that Harry becomes the Mad Hatter (by putting on his hat, lol) and him saying to Ginny "I don't know how I didn't notice for so long, but Ginny, you're a sweet piece of ass!" (or something to that effect). Also at some point an enormous animated rubber duck was sieging the Burrow.

Anyway, never managed to find it since then.
