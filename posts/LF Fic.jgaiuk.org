:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There was a fic a while ago, it starts out with Harry getting attacked by Dementors near Privet Drive but they're driven away by a mysterious figure that sends him back to Merlin's time.

Harry lives from then up until he sends himself back and gets into all sorts of stuff. He's fairly dark with some inferi-type intelligent servants, he knows the guy who supposedly created the dementors.

He pals around with Merlin who basically adopts him, he gets some infernal(?) heritage and has a hand in a lot of stuff in history.

It's been bugging me to read it again...

I GOT THE FANFIC ITCH! SEND HELP!


** That sounds pretty similar to linkffn(Basilisk-born by Ebenbild), but the details are just off enough that it might not be.

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!
