  The summer before his fifth year, Harry obtains a computer and an internet connection. Two months later, he emerges a changed person, for what has been seen cannot be unseen. AU with the whole Harry Potter timeline moved forward to the modern day. References to internet memes, video games, anime, etc.

  A thoughtless comment during the final battle, and Voldemort realizes the danger he's in and how to avoid it. Harry appears in Limbo alone with his regrets, until he finds a strange game... about himself. What happens when Harry decides to play, changing things in the process? Second chance, gamer!Harry, girl!harry(?), fanfic cliches used and/or twisted.

** If you are looking for different magic, check out linkffn(A Second Chance at Life by Miranda Flairgold). It's got different magics, new species, awesome skills and combat. One of my favorites.

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.

** This may be what you're looking for or it could be completely off. It's what immediately came to mind when I read "different magic."\\

It's a Sword Art Online/Harry Potter crossover. Harry gets trapped in Aincrad but when the game eventually ends, his magic retains the game functions like his skills and inventory etc. Probably isn't what you're looking for but it certainly is a different kind of magic.

  It has always been said that magic and technology did not mix; too bad no one ever mentioned that little fact to young Harry Potter. Add in one mad genius bent on destroying the lives of ten thousand people by trapping them inside of his online virtual reality game and you have the makings of a very dangerous brew. HP/HG

#+begin_quote
  Harry takes inspiration from a manga called Fairy Tail, as well as the great creation we call "The Internet". What follows is a different path taken. A path of strife, rebellion, and above all, power. Welcome to the New Age. Timeline moved to the 2010s. Eventual X-over with Devil May Cry 3, Stargate: SG-1, Smallville, Dresden Files and Ranma.
