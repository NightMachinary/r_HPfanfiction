So... I was just watching Keeping Up Appearances, which is one of my fave British comedies and Hyacinth always reminds me of Petunia.

Dare I ask, is there any fics where the /cough/Bucket family move to Privet Drive, or anything else for the matter?

Thanks!


** Haha, as soon as they get rid of Harry a wizarding chav family move in next door. The Dursleys know they're wizards but have to keep up the charade while the magical chavs utterly fail at hiding it. Someone write this before I do.

** That would be incredible.

Petunia and Mrs. Bucket would be constantly trying to outdo each other on propriety...

No wait! The Buckets need to live next to the Weasleys.

If I had the time, I would make this happen.
