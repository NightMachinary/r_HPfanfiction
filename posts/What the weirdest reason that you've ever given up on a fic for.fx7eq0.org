So many of the fics in the Harry Potter section of FF or AO3 are unreadable to me for one reason (I am not a fan of slash pairings in a setting with no indication of the protagonist being anything other than heterosexual) or another (Personal preference for Harry/Hermione and Harry/Luna).

What I want to know if anybody here has a stupid/weird reason for why they backed out of reading a fic?

Mine is reading a story that named Lily Evans as the protagonist in an Authors note at the top of the fic , then spelt the name as Lilly with two L every other single time the name was mentioned during the story


** Fics where the character is "pregnant" within hours of intercourse. It makes me want to send the authors a Hermione-style lecture on the mechanics of human reproduction.

Most fics where this occurs are pretty terrible anyway. But it happened at the climax of [[https://www.phoenixsong.net/fanfiction/story/4304/][this]] otherwise well written and compelling fic and totally took me out of the story.

**** Or conversely, where the first time is always super painful because hymens.

Hymens are thin membranes that have generally already begun to wear and stretch by the time of first intercourse. It's a lack of proper lubrication or being tense and nervous that usually actually leads to pain. It's a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy actually. If you think it's going to hurt, then you'll be tense and nervous so it will. Most of the time the pain is completely preventable.

Basically, FFN needs a stickied post of proper sex education.

***** Lots of people do have painful first times, lots of people don't. I'll agree that the whole hymen myth has got to go.

Sex is hard enough, especially for teens, that you shouldn't set up unrealistic expectations. Most first times are awkward, silly, a little embarrassing, uncomfortable, with a lot more ‘oh god, am I doing this right' worrying rather than a whirlwind of climaxes.

****** Your first time isn't likely to be some sort of amazing and perfect experience, sure. It likely will be a bit awkward. But sex really shouldn't be painful, even the first time, and if it is there is likely a fixable or at least treatable issue. Obviously there are exceptions to this, but they are the exceptions and not the norm. Making girls think that their first time /should/ be painful is harmful.

This is as bad a sweeping statement as anything else. Some peoples first times hurt. Others don't. For some it's both.

That stretching is what everyone is refering to when saying breaking though, outside an academic discussion.

And it's not always painless no matter what you do. For some people it hurts, at the beginning, or at the end, or at random points. And that's okay and it's not weird. You can do things to reduce the chance of pain, true, but it's not something you can guarrantee won't happen, nor does it mean there's something wrong with you.

There are a lot of things that will turn me off from a fic, but I have a particular hatred for fics that include excessive amounts of whimpering, particularly in a single chapter. I don't mind seeing woobies in fics, but the whimpering just takes it too far, especially on a character like Harry. I'm not here to read a fic where Harry has less agency than Sleeping Beauty, thank you.

** Major pet peeve: Zambini. If the author can't get a character name right, it irks me to no end.

I tried to slog through Core Treads, but eventually I really couldn't stand that he had 11-year-old Daphne (and her YOUNGER sister!) constantly spouting off sexual innuendo. I mean, these kids were absolutely obsessed with sex. The (lame IMO) excuse given was that Daphne felt "in control" by being "outrageous."

But the most unusual one, I guess, is the fic I abandoned because it was TOO good, but unfinished. To quote my review:

#+begin_quote
  This is possibly going to be the strangest review you've ever gotten, but here goes: I can't read any more of this because it's too good.

  The thing is, I know you never finished this story. It's already heartbreaking enough without coming to an abrupt halt and *never knowing* what happens. If I stop on my own, it's somehow less frustrating. So I'll follow this story and hope that someday you finish it (or post the rest if it's finished and you somehow just never got around to it), and then I'll be able to continue.

Justin Finch-Fletchely eventually walked away from his family's money and became Muggle Studies professor and marries Susan Bones. They have one daughter named Amelia who eventually married Albus

Seamus was a longtime bachelor until accidentally getting Sally-Anne Perks pregnant on New Year's Eve. Their son is named Colin and is James' best friend

Ernie Macmillan left the wizarding world behind and married a Muggle. He wrote a fantasy novel about a heroic young hero named Cedric

Michael Corner was the result of a one night stand between a Muggle nurse and pro Quidditch player David Jones. This makes him cousins with Megan and Gwenog Jones. He eventually became an administrator at St.Mungo's while his wife Padma is an Unspeakable . They have their own twins in Rose and Albus's year who David adores

Katie became the Holyhead Harpie's manager and married Alicia. They adopted several war orphans and made them Quidditch crazy . Oliver is their unofficial uncle . He never married and eventually replaced Madam Hooch

Dennis went through a very rough time following the death of his brother but eventually pulled himself together and became a Daily Prophet journalist . He married Rionach O Neal (movie only character)

Anthony Goldstein married a Muggle and had a son . He became an Auror and is Seamus's partner. They're like the Latino cops from Bad Boys

Marietta's scars eventually faded. She married her old friend Roger and had a daughter. Hermione forgave her after a few years and they now drink coffee together and gossip when they have the opportunity

Also, when something obviously far-reaching and outrageous happens (Oh god barty crouch, wormtail and lucius fucking exploded!) and the events of canon just happen anyway, beat by beat. It's infuriating.

Additionally, when a powerful character is stopped in their tracks for some stupid reasons, i.e. Harry waltzes through hordes of death eaters like the Doomslayer through Hell, only to be stopped by ~~/ropes/~~.

***** The problem with that idea is why somebody gets like 7 titles. If you're going down the idea of a woman per house. In my headcannon for stories like this is that it's main purpose would be to weaken the family by dividing the family up. Basically the law or whatever is being cited to have multiple wives was designed not to have someone inheriting multiple houses.

Though for last daughters if consort things are in the story why not just write in a third or fourth son marry into the family by taking the woman's name? I understand most of these stories are nonsense.

Before I started reading fanfictions, I used to think they were just stories written by desperate people wanting to insert themselves into their favorite works. HPMOR was the first fanfiction I read and it THOROUGHLY disabused me of that notion. I dove into fanfictions after that and found out that my previous assumptions were only correct 90% of the time. :-D

Anyway, this story that I linked, is the first self-insert story I have ever read. And it has disabused me of another notion: that self-insert fics are always trash. This one is in first person, it's in present tense and it's a self-insert. Recipe for disaster? It's anything BUT!

GildeHarry kept making jokes about Hermione being Harry's girlfriend, and then he kept making jokes, and then the jokes started getting sexual, and then he commented to a 13 year old girl that she made a very cute cat girl and said she should take pictures of her naked body as she changed back to human to follow the progress, convincing her that it was okay because she had fur, telling her to have 12 year old Harry help, all while knowing that as the process continued she would lose the fur and eventually Harry would be taking pictures of a normal naked 13 year old girl. That was it for me and I'm a little disgusted that I continued at all past the point where the Lockhart parts of GildeHarry informed the Harry part that wizarding age of consent was 11 and that there was no problem if he wanted to sleep with any of his students or any of the other red flags.

**** Oh god that makes me glad I noped out when the insane Ron bashing started lol

it was extra disturbing because, at least in the chapters I got through, instead of making Ron an insane evil idiot, they kept his canon personality. So Harry was just bullying a child who couldn't understand why their teacher was hellbent on breaking up his friendship.

Man and the fic's premise was so interesting too. what a waste

***** You were smarter than I. I've been on a dry spell for interesting fics and liked the premise enough to push through a bit too much questionable stuff.

The premise really was interesting too. I've never seen a do-over with Lockhart before, and the GildeHarry was interesting at first. The merged personality had fantastic potential, the braggart that is Lockhart combined with the humble Harry. The desire for fame of Lockhart with Harry's desire to just be Harry. Lockharts need to be in the spotlight with Harry's dislike of being in the spotlight for anything other than his own efforts.

Given the skill level provided this version of Harry it made for the possibilities of a Lockhart that actually was what he pretended to be. Someone with the skills to take on daring adventures out of both a desire to help people and a thirst for the limelight. Someone that won't shut up about their exploits but with the skills and experience to back up their mouth.

Harry's goals of stopping the war and saving people with Lockharts goals of getting the best publicity out of it. Does he do everything to prevent the rise of Voldemort or does he weaken everything and then let Voldemort be resurrected so he can defeat him in combat and claim all the fame that goes with that?

​

That all could have been fun and funny to read. Instead there was bashing, and inheritance tests, and Lord Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Peverel-Slytherin-Gaunt, cat girls, and pedophilia.

****** I know right? When I got to the Ron bashing parts at first I was confused because of him having his normal personality. I mean the author made dumbledore evil, so it was a weird choice. I thought maybe it was going the route of GildeHarry being a villain because of some weird combo with their personalities or something, but, nope, he's actually supposed to somehow be in the right.

Thinking about it, a parody of bashing fics where Ron (or your character of choice) is the protagonist and has to deal with people disproportionately overreacting to his character flaws sounds like an interesting read. Like Harry and Hermione dropping him as friends and Voldemort thinking he'd make a great deatheater because he talks while he eats lmao

**** The earliest you could do with a canon-compliant Harry would be with him at 17, but unless you change canon at other places (Tonks did not marry, the marriage was admitted by both sides as a mistake or they stayed apart after Lupin ran), Tonks would not be in a good place, emotionally, to get into a new relationship at that point. Freshly widowed and a newly-made mother, there would be other things on her mind. The only way would be with Harry intended as a "rebound", which turns into something more permanent over time. Or maybe with both of them looking for something to get over the pain of the war and then going from there.

Harry is difficult to judge IMO because he is written without consistency. In some regards, he is old far beyond his years, in other regards he is, well emotionally challenged would be a good term. Realistically, he would need years of therapy for the Dursleys, nevermind what had happened at Hogwarts and during the hunt. Therefore it is quite difficult to say when he'd be an equal for Tonks.

Of course, you could write an imbalanced relationship, but unlike with most fanfics, Harry would not be in charge there. It might be unhealthy, but I can think of at least three ways to justify that in HBP without altering the characters too much.

So I saw more than a few people in high school actively seeking out, and getting into, relationships that were 5+. They didn't seem to be much crappier than most other high school relationships. I just don't get the "iz grown up and toddler" mentality people seem to get.

Most of the ship stories with them seem to start with them grieving Sirius/Remus after the DoM, and bonding over the similar isolation and abuse being a Metamorphagus and TBWL respectively has put them through. Followed by sleeping together at a very much legal in the real UK 16 y/o for him.

How to now make it weird would be if the child version got the memories of the future version but was emotionally and mentally still a child.

What I personally don't like however is "I'm an adult in a child's body but my body still reacts like that of a child so I cry over everything, am immature and blame my child's body for that". Why even make them mentally an adult then?

***** Pedophilia is an attraction to *prepubescent* children. That means they haven't entered puberty yet. Barring medical conditions pretty much everyone has started puberty well before they turn 15.

On top of which, age of consent (at which point you're magically an adult for sex. SHAZAM!) is 16 in the actual UK. Which is a pretty typical age in the west. So not only not pedophilia, but not even underage for the last two books. Which could be earlier if they writer claims that Magic Britain kept SHAZAM! set at one of the older levels of the actual UK.

The 18 thing started due to it being the age in California, screenwriters being lazy, and it being the usual minimum age for porn performers. Which combined with the bizarre predilection people have for learning about criminal justice from cop shows leads to all sorts of people believing it's some universal law, even though California having one that high is downright freakish.

- Using a character from another fandom because they didn't want to create an OC for one or two unimportant scenes. I mean, you could take the personality from an existing character, slap another name on them and call them an OC but it gets very distracting reading about Kagome Higurashi in fucking Hogwarts.

I remember reading a fic (half of the first chapter before I dropped it) where the author spent forever describing in detail how Ron had to lift Harry up into the carriage, then it continued with Harry's monologue during the sorting where he was jealous of the first years for being taller than him.... That fic was set in his fifth year.

That is what I said. I said COULD POTENTIALLY. That means that there is a chance his glasses aren't because of genetics. Bad diet, getting frequently beat up/slapped by the Dursleys, and living in a cramped dark cupboard can make you require glasses. Even then, they gave him "close enough" glasses from a pharmacy-like store. So while they helped a bit, they were making the problem worse. Don't forget the horcrux.

******* I disagree that 'being raised correctly' has anything to do with whether or not Harry needed glasses in the first place.

Malnutrition has to become quite severe before it affects eyesight. Physical abuse would only cause eyesight issues if there were physical damage to the eye or serious brain damage and simply living in a dark cupboard wouldn't make Harry need glasses. Straining his eyes to do homework or something else in the dark might not have been pleasant but while eye-strain is often symptomatic of /needing/ glasses, eye strain brought on by other means does not cause vision loss.

Did they? Where is the canon evidence for this? We know Harry wears round glasses, we know those glasses are 'held together with a lot of Sellotape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose' and that is the sum of what we know.

From personal experience - as someone who has been wearing glasses since she was seven - Harry's utter inability to see without his glasses tells me that his prescription is /much/ stronger than could be dealt with by those ready made reading glasses.

** The only one I can think of that really annoyed me was a story where the author changed something major about Harry (can't remember what, pretty sure part of it was that he wasn't in Gryffindor though, he was in another house, maybe he was a genius too? I cannot remember) and then just... stuck to the original plot. Like they made this big deal about changing this important aspect of the main character in a way that /should/ have affected how things happened and changed them and then it didn't impact the actual plot at all, everything happened as it did in the book with maybe some extra parts added in and using their own language, but it was just a re-write of the same stuff. It annoyed me so much as soon as I realized what was happening.

Otherwise, I'm generally pretty easy-going and will continue to read a fic no matter what as long as it's at least interesting and can hold my attention and not too poorly written, and my threshold for poorly written is pretty damn low. But, too many obvious spelling and grammar issues can get annoying. Like I get it, spell check won't catch everything, neither will a beta if you've got one, mistakes happen, we're all only human, I try to give people the benefit of the doubt and keep reading. But when they consistently misuse words (defiantly instead of definitely, to instead of too, etc.) or keep spelling them wrong I'm gonna nope right outta there eventually. Even I can only take so much.

​

> Bad spelling or sloppy writing (that is to say typos such as switching letters or forgetting punctuation).

> Crude crack (swearing every other sentence or forced dirty humor)

> Time travel where they wish to "preserve the timeline", the time-traveler doesn't do anything meaningful, the traveler returns to their original timeline or the time travel actually doesn't effect the future.

> Hedwig or Ghost dying. Immediately bounce out.

> Any sort of cheating in relationships really. Have a massive issue about it in any way.

> Hypocritical main characters.

> Reverse character development (for example, Harry becomes more ruthless in dealing with his enemies then somewhere near the end suddenly weeps as he "became a murderer".

> The use of single quotes ('he said so') for dialogue instead of regular quotation marks ("He said so"). Honestly it's just a chore to read and annoys me immensely. In fact I actually downloaded a few I really wanted to read and edited the quotes normal through Word.

> Any of that Lord-Potter cringe-cliches. Some can be good, most really aren't.

> Fanfics that don't have proper sentence or story pacing. I've come across some that read like a summary of a story rather than an actual story.

> Fanfics that don't use any way to indicate a scene change or story break.

> Not a fan of slash, though it obviously doesn't bother everyone so wouldn't critique a story based on it - except when it includes Voldemort, because what.

> AU's that make it too vague what the actual changes in the world are or start out to different to keep track of.

> Stories where muggles are definitely going to wipe out wizard kind.

> Stories where wizards are definitely going to wipe out muggle kind.

> The incorporation of technology or muggle subjects into Hogwarts. Honestly, I'm reading HP for the magic, not everything non-magic that should be part of that world.

While I concede that it is somewhat logical, the fact that single quotes also look similar to apostrophes are very distracting for me.

'Jake's dogs couldn't have won' as opposed to "Jake's dogs couldn't have won"

Although I suppose at the end it's about how you read it growing up, and therefore making it the norm. To me double quotes have been the norm throughout my reading, to others single quotes would be - similar to the use of 'o' instead of 'ou' in certain words. Technically neither is incorrect but whenever I read honor instead of honour it always stands out.

** This isn't Harry Potter specifically, but at least the first part applies there, too.

I read (and write) more in the Alexander the Great fanfiction. As a gay man, I get pretty annoyed with bad descriptions of gay sex from what I'm pretty damn sure are [straight] women authors with no damn clue how a man's body works or how gay sex typically goes. It's the flippin' age of the Internet. You can find out ANYthing online, chicks. /Look it up./

BUT, that's a logical reason. Ha. My somewhat weird reason is any fic where Hephaistion's eyes are described as "cerulean blue." That makes me laugh my ass off and totally kicks me out of the story. I know they're basing it on Jared Leto's appearance, who was cast as Hephaistion in the Oliver Stone movie. But Jesus. Talk about a purple-prose description. It's just too ridiculous. At first, when I was reading, I put up with it, but now I just shut that puppy down.

In ANY fandom, silly descriptions of eye color is a big turn-off for me.

** I wouldn't call it stupid, but definitely weird- I have friends who just move on.

When authors have court cases/law as a large part of the plot and you can blatantly tell they know absolutely nothing about law. (Harry not having a barrister in his trial for underage magic is pretty suspicious tbh J.K.) I have come across many a fic where Dumbledore is put on trial for his actions 2 weeks after Harry finds out about most of them. This is not realistic, even if we use English law from before the witch trials. This also disregards the fact that he is Chief Warlock and probably has more than half of the Wizengamot in his pocket, yet he still ends up in Azkaban for 100+ year or with Grindelwald in Nuremberg. I wouldn't mind if there was world building to explain the legal system, but they just ignore it.

I know I am not the most knowledgeable about law, i'm not a law student, but my mother is a paralegal and i've helped her with paper work since i was young so i can at least tell when something isn't right.

I know I missed other bad law tropes but those parts are just the ones i can think of rn.

** A few of my turn offs...

Too American. Harry Potter is an English kid/bloke. Not once in 7 books does he express any interest in the US. So authors that have him fleeing to the US at the drop of a hat, or behaving in a way that emulates American teenagers, drive me barmy. This includes all the fics that dedicate page-space to telling us about tuition fees for Hogwarts. The UK doesn't do that, you know! It also includes when the narrative is so American it become un-immersive. In the UK, we do not wear pants. Well, we /do/, but we wear them underneath trousers, or jeans.

Muggle superiority. Seriously, nothing destroys the magic of a fic more quickly than the narrator trying to convince readers that Muggle technology is better than magic, or that Muggles have all this creativity that wizards and witches don't. They're all still people, and inventiveness is not solely a property of the mundane world...

Misspelling - especially of characters' names.

Movie derivation. If it's clear that a person has drawn their conclusions about the magical world from the films, rather than from the books.

- 1st person pov. Simply no.
- if something ridiculous happens. And I don't mean a character being gay who isn't in canon (I even prefer slashfics tbh) but I mean something that makes no sense in the setting of the story. For example a character reacting a certain way without build-up/explanation whatsoever. A sentence, a plotpoint or even a conversation that makes no sense whatsoever.
- A name spelled wrong over and over. If I read Creature instead of Kreacher one more time I am out.
- His green shiny orbs.
- People acting out of character. OOc characters are fine but I mean acting out of character of the persona that has been established in the story
- Harry (Or any canonical non-slytherin) getting sorted into Slytherin and then not acting like they belong into that house at all. And I don't mean 11 year olds acting like little manipulative politicians. Just give me a reason why the hat sorted them there and show it in their character. Competiveness, ambition to win. Cleverness. It could simply be spite to oppose their parents. That goes for any resorting.
- Bad writing quality. There is a balance of how many grammarical errors can be in a fic. It's always Storytelling Quality in comparison to grammar errors. In most of the longer fics the latter recedes with time but if I have 100k fic and I doesn't get better sometimes you just give up

*** Not OP but... recognising that people are attractive is not an indication, at all, of sexuality. I feel it's a bit like suggesting everyone who's ever called an animal attractive is a zoophile?

There's a big difference between reading Albus Potter and Harry Potter as bisexual. I think CC is blatant queerbaiting but I also think it implies a certain set of feelings on Albus' part towards Delphini. I'm sure there are people who will look at Harry and say, "Well, maybe we can take this as evidence..." but if you're from the same milieu as the author and you've really got to rummage through the text to find evidence it's usually a sign of "bad writing" or "not the intention".

Now, I completely understand that people are interested in having more diverse characters but there's a difference between a non-heterosexual Seamus, Nott, Bulstrode, Terry Boot, Ernie, Justin, Hannah, Neville, Charlie, Dumbledore, McGonagall etc. etc. and a non-heterosexual Draco, any other Weasley, Harry, Snape*, Astoria, Hagrid, Dean, Lavender, Hermione etc. etc. And that difference is that the latter characters are written by a, let's say, not overly progressive author in a heteronormative milieu to have straight relationships.

Of course, there's a difference between, say, a bisexual Dean and a bisexual Harry too... we really know very little about Dean, but a lot about Harry.

For my part, I like my AUs to be clear about what makes them AU. If you say the difference is that there's a portrait that talks to Snape, I want the differences to connect to that portrait. If you say that it's a total overhaul fic which just so happens to use character names and maybe the setting... I'm probably not going to read your fic because I'm picky. I'll happily read a fic with Seamus/Dean, but I'm not sure I could read that if Seamus or Dean were protagonists. If it conflicts with my preferred ships, I probably won't read it (I like canon pairings). But I also don't think I would read Seamus/Terry as protagonists but before this year I would also have told you I wouldn't read a romance novel (and so many fanfics fall in that category), so maybe one day.

Okay you took what I said and just dialed that shit up to 100 for some reason lol. "so it's not like he is incapable of finding men attractive" I said, as a way to show that in addition to there being no direct argument against Harry being bi in canon, there are moments that indicate that it is within the realm of possiblity.

" you've really got to rummage through the text to find evidence it's usually a sign of "bad writing" or "not the intention". "

That's the thing though, you don't really have to rummage anything. The only reason I mentioned Harry finding some men attractive was because I find this idea ridiculous-

"with no indication of the protagonist being anything other than heterosexual"

-but also didn't want to get downvoted into oblivion for pointing out blatant bi erasure. Because sure, there is no indication that Harry is anything but heterosexual in canon. There is also no indication that Harry is anything but bisexual, however.

And using the author's personal beliefs as a source when analyzing characters in a fanfiction setting is really weird to me. The whole thing kinda starts to crumble if you don't look at the story with at least a little bit of death of the author, I think.

EDIT: Oh, I've been awake for more than twenty hours so my brain is not functioning properly. I should've added this: You may not agree with much of anything I've said in my reply, and that's okay.

***** Your position is "there's no evidence that Harry's not bi in canon". Actually, there is. It's the complete absence of any reason to imagine that he is.

Bisexual erasure exists because people don't write and/or recognise bisexuality. If you're willing to take "no evidence against" as a reason to imagine a character is bisexual, then bisexual erasure only has meaning in the case where a character dates one gender and then, when dating another, is seen as now being (case dependent) straight or gay (rather than bi, pan or whatever).

To the extent that you offer positive reasons to believe Harry could be bisexual in canon, pointing out that recognising attraction doesn't have anything to do with sexuality is entirely sufficient.

  And using the author's personal beliefs as a source when analyzing characters in a fanfiction setting is really weird to me.
#+end_quote

Then don't reply to a statement that is about canon (i.e. no indication of the protagonist being anything other than heterosexual).

The question you've got to ask is... what is fanfiction?

Let's say someone rewrites His Dark Materials with Lyra being substituted with Ginny and Will's becoming Harry... but neither uses magic. Is that Harry Potter fanfic? Not really. It's just His Dark Materials where the protagonists have new names.

To count as fanfic, you've got to offer the reader something they recognise as being from canon. You can get some very, very different worlds, but it's not enough to just use the names if you're doing that. But if you are using the canon setting, it's much easier to do very different things with the characters.

Fanfic is all about canon. And whatever nonsense Barthes and his successors have to say about Death of the Author, the reality is that authors don't write for funsies. They write to communicate. We cannot take a text and consider it as a fait accompli. They're developed, and if you've got insight into that development process (e.g. if you know 10,000 monkeys were sat at typewriters or the author has particular biases) those are read with the text to produce the meaning. Forgetting this practical reality /is/ an error. When someone says "I didn't mean to say that", it's worth listening to... just as they should understand (as Barthes does), that the reader isn't always aware of what they /did/ mean (intent and meaning are separate). But when the reader does know something about intent?

I don't think it's reasonable to read canon!Harry as bisexual. I don't think Rowling intended it and I don't think there's anything more to it than "Cedric was handsome" or equivalent remarks. It follows that an author rather needs to say, "In my fic, one of the differences with canon is that Harry is bi..." Although, of course, authors will probably just say something like bi!Harry as a tag or whatever.

You can't escape canon in fanfic. You can fix it. You can comply with it. You can change it. You can reject it. But everything is defined by canon.

I rather suggest you ditch the Death of the Author and use something more useful like a communications process model to approach reading.

While completely ignoring the author's existence when analyzing their work is counter-intuitive at best, using author's statements about what they actually intented to say in the text as gospel makes art criticism worthless. But sure, go off I guess. I kinda feel like an idiot for calling your opinion valid now, as you seem incapable of engaging with a person disagreeing with you in a fundamental way on how to approach art without being condescending as fuck.

Your mistake is thinking that art criticism is an interesting way of reading. It's really not. Read for comprehension. Read for mentalities. Read for meaning. But for art criticism? Not worthwhile at all.

Case in point... sometimes if you think something is condescending, it's really going to reflect the author's opinion of the author. Always ask "why this feature"?

******** Even after many years I still get annoyed at how people feel the need to state that non-canon relationships are, in fact, not in canon.

Yes, canon relationships are those that were explicitly stated in the books, but we can fill empty spaces however we want.

Why there are always people who need to "correct" us.

There are no indicators that Harry can be gay/bi/whatever to you? Fine. To me there are.

[[/u/FrameworkisDigimon][u/FrameworkisDigimon]] - [[/u/Cally6][u/Cally6]] said "let's agree to disagree", but you had to press on that there is no way that could be right and I find it very upsetting that you try to rationalize your dislike when the only actual reason is solely because... you don't like it. Sigh.

Even the thread author with their "no indicator". I guess if you don't like any given thing, you're not inclined to see it or a possibility for it.

But please don't straight out reject our preferences.

(And even if it was explicitly stated that "Harry did not like boys. He only liked girls" in books, we /still/ have room for interpretation, but I'm too tired with writing this comment to delve in as for why is that, but short version - I disagree with your one, true way of interpretation, communication, message, story and author, so... as [[/u/Cally6][u/Cally6]] wrote - we see things differently on a fundamental level.)

********* Don't come preaching whatever bullshit you want when they specifically point out that they've edited their post. I've got no idea if that was there when I read their post. It was ten fucking days ago and edits don't appear in the messages. I would have to go to the post itself. Which I might not actually do because, you know, from my POV I've got the whole thing open.

Now, let's start to think why I'm calling your post bullshit. From the top:

#+begin_quote
  Even after many years I still get annoyed at how people feel the need to state that non-canon relationships are, in fact, not in canon.
#+end_quote

Okay, cool. Now remember what we're actually talking about. Not whatever idea you've got in your head, but what the specific context is:

#+begin_quote
  . And like, is there any indication that Harry is not bi? He compliments Cedric's and Bill's looks in the books
#+end_quote

Oh... that's right, canon. We're not discussing whether or not a fanfic can run wild with whatever they want. We could be, sure, and people will probably disagree with what I have to say about that (see above), but we're not. We're talking specifically about the books. About canon.

What I find particularly odd is that I'm repeating this point. It's entirely possible our friend [[/u/Cally6][u/Cally6]] didn't intend to write a post that defined itself in the context of canon. Given they made this same point and I replied with the same thing, it's an entirely plausible conclusion. And to that I would say... that's why authorial intent matters.

People fail to communicate all the time. And people should be able to choose how what arguments they embroil themselves in. "I agree to disagree" is usually invoked, as here, when people don't want to discuss the basis of the disagreement. Which, here, is not "what the text says" but instead "how should we go about reading the text". Those are entirely different propositions.

#+begin_quote
  we can fill empty spaces however we want.
#+end_quote

Nope.

Pay attention to what you're writing. Specifically this bit:

#+begin_quote
  There are no indicators that Harry can be gay/bi/whatever to you? Fine. To me there are.
#+end_quote

Since you missed it... what that means is that people disagree about what's an empty space.

#+begin_quote
  I find it very upsetting that you try to rationalize your dislike
#+end_quote

Honestly... grow up.

People want to think about what they read. That's why Barthes had a job and it's presumably why he came up with the Death of the Author. It's why people disagree about how to go about thinking about reading.

If you find that someone else's explanation of their thought processes hurts your feelings, then they better bloody well have written something offensive. Have I? No, go on, articulate it. Do the fucking legwork your points rely on instead of calling it "rationalising".

There's a thing that used to be really popular... it's called "reading comprehension". What that means is that when someone writes something... you try and understand what it means. Consider:

"the world is a giant purple elephant"

Not even Barthes would agree that every reading of that is valid. The construction of the text through the reader is more appropriately taken to mean something more like:

1. the reader interprets the text through their own experiences and biases
2. this extends to what they consider to be choices made by the author
3. hence, the meaning of the text is idiosyncratic and dependent on the reader
4. therefore, the author is dead.

Rather than "the reader can make up whatever they want". The Death of the Author... unless Barthes was really misunderstood by the people who wrote the explanations I've read of this... still allows for a reading to be "wrong".

In other approaches to reading, it is vastly easier to claim that a reading is wrong. That someone has failed to comprehend.

#+begin_quote
  But please don't straight out reject our preferences.
#+end_quote

You can't have it both ways. Either I'm rationalising or I'm rejecting your point of view "straight out". I cannot be doing both at the same time.

Look... it's even possible to write wrong.

#+begin_quote
  I disagree with your one, true way of interpretation, communication, message, story and author,
#+end_quote

You don't seem to have understood a single thing I've written or why I wrote it so, actually, I doubt it.

But, sure, that's probably my fault. After all, I didn't actually explain... did I?

The communication process model I'm familiar with (there are several) posits that a text starts with an intent. That is, what the author wants to say. This is then (idiosyncratically) encoded into whatever the chosen medium is... say, for example, a novel. The text is then decoded (idiosyncratically) by the reader.

Fuuuck. Intent, text and meaning are all different things... just as in Barthes' case. So much so there are really pretentious wankers on the internet... if you think I'm pretentious, ooh boy you've got to meet the people I think are pretentious... mistake them for the same thing.

The difference is that the communication process model assumes that intent is, you know, actually important. But it does so in a way that means it's not invalid to say things like "but that's not what it means". What it means is you say things like "yes, but what you /actually/ said was this"... which, lo, comes across as... condescending. And what it also means is that you find someone reading something it's natural to say, "it seems like they're trying to say" not, as with Barthes, "it's reasonable to infer given these biases that this says..." Idiosyncratic interpretations are very much a bug, in the the communication process model... a sign of failed communication.

You cannot hold that there is one true way of interpretation if you believe in the communication process model. Why? Because then it means you don't believe the text is decoded. That text and meaning can be collapsed into one thing.

You, well our friend, were told to look at the communications process model. Is it really my fault that you didn't? In context... kind of.

Let's walk back a bit and put Barthes in a slightly different context called the linguistic turn. To this particular kind of thinking, the available words to describe reality shape reality. It's a bit difficult to tell because they tend to produce very... dense, self-serious (as opposed to my signature style of condescension towards the reader and author, I think it makes me seem more human) and consciously avant garde texts (and remember who is writing this), but I think it's fair to say these people don't think reality actually exists. Why? Well, it's because text and context are collapsed into one and the same thing. The author doesn't really choose words as they, instead, access them.

This is, as an English speaker, a really, really strange thing to believe. And it's probably quite important in this context that I'm familiar with English speakers who are paying a lot of attention to French speakers. So, when you come across the former noting that river has different meanings in French and English as an example of what they're talking about... they don't talk about how everyone knows the French don't have a word for home, just house. And as much as that latter example is precisely what they're saying (having a word for something allows it to be part of your reality), it also causes (imo) the whole house of cards to collapse. Once you note that synonyms are usually imperfect... with subtle shades of meaning... it's suddenly important to remember that there is an author that exists and exerts agency. The choice of that word over this one suddenly matters. It all suddenly becomes idiosyncratic again. And why? Because people get confused. If it was just accessing, then missing that "I'm happy" isn't "I'm joyful" wouldn't happen.

But, of course, you rather have to believe me because I'm not showing you what I'm talking about.

So, what's the point? Well, it's like I said before... "why this feature?" or "why is it like this?" What an author tried, failed and succeeded at all become worthwhile questions. And when it comes to determining what a book says about the sexuality of its characters, it becomes less a question of "you can see this as evidence" and much more about "should you see that evidence and, also, was it intended as evidence?" Why? But, again, even Barthes would have the "should" question.

(Although, again, the positive reasoning offered here is nothing of the sort. It is evidence incapable of bearing the burden of the argument it was used to support, as seen by the zoophilia point. Or, at least, I think so. The logic appears identical... X thinks Y is attractive, therefore X is attracted to the type of thing Y is. Even if we're only talking about "can" it is still wrong to cite this as evidence for a bisexual Harry. At least, without further argument. Always remember, the facts do not speak for themselves. )

Please, only reply if you're willing to talk about:

#+begin_quote
  we still have room for interpretation
#+end_quote

Because it's the only remotely interesting... as opposed to annoying (and being misunderstood... as per my earlier point... is annoying)... thing you managed to say, with a ten day advantage on the rest of us.

********** "Have a downvote." ...? xD Lol, the whole final part of your comment... You really are pretentious. xD

My opinion still remains that nothing in canon indicates that Harry is not bi and that yes, we can fill blank spaces however we want.\\
How many times with the zoophilia... You're overshooting with this argument. Harry being bi is plausible. JKR focus was not on sexuality of any character as it's not really important to the story, that's why it's entirely possible that Harry's not entirely straight, it's within reason. Harry being a zoophile - not so much.

You straight out refuse possibility of Harry being non-straight because the idea doesn't sit well with your reception... Then you rationalize why, in your opinion, it is true.

Your thought process does not "hurt" me, your insistence and tone more so. Did I hurt you? Or did I annoy you? Those pesky similar meanings.

I have no idea if you read the comment before or after edit, but if you read it before, then I apologize, it just looked like you saw it and decided to press on anyway, you come off as that kind of a person.

Also, sorry that I replied 10 days after you convo, I didn't know reddit threads have such a quick expiration date.

If it's not interesting to you, which - fair enough, an expected outcome - you could've saved time for both of us and not write a very convoluted, incohesive, all over the place essay comment and just write "nope". Would be quicker that way.

Since the fic was incomplete and this was like 1 chapter before the last one, I decided to abort early as a result because I didn't want to end the fic on a sad note, even if the story itself was far from over and truly that particular part was very insignificant in the overarching plot.

** Annoying author comment - in my subjective opinion - meaning author was arrogant / condescending.

Weird / infantile text breakers (is that what it's called?) - e.g. sth like _)(0)(_++^++_)(0)(_ or <3<3<3<3<3.

"Snape Manor". That's all it took once. The overuse of word "manor" generally pisses me off so much. xD

"Hadrian" or "Henry" Potter. Or renaming characters in general. DON'T change his name. I don't care about your reasoning. Figure it out. There are better ways than renaming characters. It's better if Harry doesn't start to think about himself as "Hadrian" or "Corey" or whatever and eventually it all falls apart and his real name get out into the open. Unless it's kinda short-term and motivated inside the story (e.g. going undercover), don't do it. Please. As for time travel - no. Still - don't do it. If you don't change his appearance, why change his name, he's so obviously a Potter (as stated many times in books "you look just like James", so I assume that Potter traits are really recognizable). IF you change his appearance (which I honestly dislike as well, haha ^^') then no need to change his name, or at least not an entire name - just change the surname slightly. And not for forever. I don't know, I just don't like it.

"Harry James Potter..." - characters who've either never or very rarely spoken like that - calling someone by their full name - suddenly do it once every paragraph / chapter.

"..." - every. sentence. finished. with. fucking. dots.

EDIT (only for this one point): Oh, also "raven". Raven this, raven that, while here I am sitting / lying in my bed seeing with my mind's eye an actual fucking bird.

EDIT3: Also a "cub" or a "prongslet" to a lesser degree.

Stuttering, fair, virgin maiden Harry/other.

Harry gets a neverending shitstorm of extreme abuse.Harry keeps getting raped for no reason at all.

Harry going dark / anti-muggle / racist / supremacist or indifferent to their fate. To me that just a no-no most of the time.

** It is okay if it's not a fic but a book series?

So, there was this one written by a juvenile moron of an Author, See there were many great fanfictions for said story out there so I decided to read the Original.

I was barely able to slog through 3 books and gave up on the fourth.

It was...utter fucking garbage that only a 3 year old child could ever love. Everyone who is Evil is ugly, no exceptions. If it isn't Ugly, then it's going to get redemption during the course of the story. Or it's going to get ugly in the future by playing ninja fruit with his own soul.

The concept of age, of /growth/ did not even exist there. The wise old man was wise even when he was not an old man, The hateful teenager was still hateful when he was 30, 11 year old ignorant children were still ignorant at the age of 17.

The 'obese cousin' was apparently a bully and the MC hated him, but then in the 1st book a random bloke /(who was expelled out of his school in his third year, casted a partial human transfiguration -which he would have learnt at 7th year of said school- with a broken wand and is also capable of flying to island in the midst of storm without a broom -which wouldn't support his weight anyway- or a flying motorcycle, probably with a spell which allowed for unaided flight and was known by only one other person -before said person taught said spell to the 30-something-year-old-hateful-teenage as a reward for killing the wise-old-man; Yep, definitely not evil at all!)/ did something to said cousin that would haunt him for decades and probably gave him a phobia of everyone else similar to the MC, in return the kind the unloved MC felt true happiness for the first time in his life in his pitch black heart.

In the 4th book the older brother of MC's friend decided to just drop a candy in the presence of a 14 year old child and /cackled in orgasmic pleasure/ as the cursed candy made the 'bullying cousin' choke on his four fucking feet long tongue /-which probably explains why said cousin and his parents loathed his very existence now that i think about it-/ but it's okay, the bully deserved it, he was after all a 14 year old obese walrus who should have known better, seriously, what kind of 14 year old eats /candies/?

I think you've gotten a basic idea of why I abandoned said story...But, if that's not enough.

The wise old man knew that the 15 month old MC needed to die, a true shame, so instead of doing the dirty deed himself the man left the tiny lamb to raise itself into a nice, skinny and malnourished Sheep, armed him with ignorance, kindness and a stunning spell and sent him to battle armies of bloodthirsty monsters who themselves were armed with cruelty, cunning /-equivalent to that of an angry toddler, or the author-/ mind wiping spells, torture spells, mind control spells, cursed fire spell, soul ripping spells and a few other spells on top of those.

The good people of the world helped the MC with the age old tradition of: 'burying the head in the sand and hoping that the next time they raise their heads the problem would have disappeared'.

Oh and if that was not enough, i've got the final nail in the coffin:

The good guys won and the MC lived happily ever after /-and had three children with the clone of his mother-./

​

Yeah I know, It's the weirdest reason for abandoning such a promising story. But what can I do? Maybe my brain is just wired incorrectly.

BTW did you know that killing terrorist apparently makes people really good rulers who can juggle 3 full time jobs simultaneously? Yeah, I'm totally gonna use this life hack to become the God-Emperor of mankind.

** Any fic that uses "Hadrian" instead of Harry gets dropped. "Harry" is not a nickname - it is a legitimate name (no matter how odd it is) and it isn't short for "Hadrian" of all things...

Any fic that uses "Runes" or "Wards" at any level also gets dropped.

"Runes" is a goddamn /language class/, and is not magical programming. It's about learning dead languages so you can read old books written in them, and that's it!

Also, "Wards" don't exist in the Harry Potter setting. They never have, and the concept doesn't apply the way fic-authors seem to think it does. The setting has 'protective enchantments', but not "wards". Use of the term sets off my ire something fierce.

Similarly, I'm terribly annoyed by any fic that features "courtly/noble etiquette is pureblood manners" bullshit. There are no "Lords and Ladies", no one's called "Scion X" or "Heir Y". The Wizarding World have been divorced from the nobility for centuries, and the culture never let it keep on. Any similar "Most Noble and Ancient House of Z" are also terrible because that line was made by Sirius making a mocking joke about how ridiculously proud his family was of their bullshit pureblood lineage.

Also, any story where the Goblins like a character because the wizard/witch treats them nicely and lavishes them with titles or other medieval methods of address or special goblin-greetings irks me because the goblins in the HP setting have a long and bloody history with wizardkind, and they don't actually have any of that in their society. They're artisans and merchants, and while their species has a ruthless streak a mile-wide in general, they're not all warmongers on the inside nor are they completely obsessed with gold as some fic-authors like to portray them as. They're running the banks because they're bloody good at it and their ruthlessness and nature means they can be trusted to keep up their deals.

Also, any fic where the character goes up to Gringotts, demands a blood-test be taken and gains access to Vaults or some bullshit. The goblins don't keep track of wizarding lineages like that, nor do they give a damn about your blood. If you have proof that you've inherited a vault, you have to give them the proof to gain access to it, they don't just give you access to anything just because your blood says you're related to someone. That's not their job.

(Edit: I Stand Corrected. I have apparently mis-remembered the scope to which things were taken in canon, which was much further than I remembered reading when I was younger.) +Any fic that implies that Harry was habitually beaten or physically abused by the Dursleys gets dropped. Similarly if he's habitually starved and malnourished under their care. None of that happened in canon - the Dursleys were strict and Dudley was a bully, but they were not physically abusive, and they always fed him an appropriate amount - never too much, and certainly never too little. Harry growing up short and skinny was as much a result of his cramped living conditions as it was genetics from being as wiry as his father, and not because he was being beaten by Vernon nor from being starved by Petunia. Nor was Harry treated like a slave - he did the same chores Petunia would do, just the more menial ones. Harry washed the dishes, tided the house on occasion, and weeded the garden, but Petunia did pretty much all the cooking and the majority of the gardening.+

+Like, I won't claim that the Dursleys were great people, but they did the absolute bare minimum to keep Harry alive and reasonably healthy. They fed him just enough, clothed him just enough (even if they were all of Dudley's hand-me-downs which were still kinda too big), sent him to school, gave him glasses when he couldn't see, and kept him housed (even if it was just a tiny little cupboard). Could they have done better? Sure. But some fic-authors like to over-exaggerate how awful they were, partly to paint Harry as a woobie for having to live there, when in-truth, Harry just disliked living there because he wasn't treated as kindly or compassionately there as they treated Dudley, and felt lonely and isolated at Privet Drive given their fear of magic. Any fic that has the Dursleys acting in excess of their canonical actions tends to get dropped really quickly, just as much as any fic where Harry claims that they acted even more terribly than they did in canon and uses that as an excuse for some other bulshit.+

​

...Basically, anything along any of these similar lines will cause me to drop a fic.

Honestly, it's like some fic-authors don't even bother glancing at the source material to confirm whether their bullshit is accurate or not, they're just treating what nonsense some other fic-authors are cooking up as canonical elements of the setting without knowing a damned thing about the setting they're writing in...

"‘OUT!' roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall,"

"Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall."

"As neither Dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn't really done magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan."

"While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice-creams, Harry cleaned the windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed the flowerbeds, pruned and watered the roses and re-painted the garden bench. The sun blazed overhead, burning the back of his neck."

"And laughing like a maniac, he dragged Harry back upstairs."

"He himself fitted the cat-flap in the bedroom door, so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day. They let Harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening. Otherwise, he was locked in his room around the clock."

"The cat-flap rattled and Aunt Petunia's hand appeared, pushing a bowl of tinned soup into the room. Harry, whose insides were aching with hunger, jumped off his bed and seized it. The soup was stone cold, but he drank half of it in one gulp. Then he crossed the room to Hedwig's cage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into her empty food tray."

"He put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the cat-flap and lay back down on the bed, somehow even hungrier than he had been before the soup."

"‘You'll get the stuffing knocked out of you, won't you?' roared Uncle Vernon, advancing on Harry with his fist raised."

"To make Dudley feel better about it all, Aunt Petunia had insisted that the whole family follow the diet too. She now passed a grapefruit quarter to Harry. He noticed that it was a lot smaller than Dudley's."

"The moment he had got wind of the fact that he was expected to survive the summer on carrot sticks,"

"Harry felt as though his head had been split in two. Eyes streaming, he swayed, trying to focus on the street to spot the source of the noise, but he had barely staggered upright when two large purple hands reached through the open window and closed tightly around his throat."

"Harry moved a few steps closer, taking care to stop just short of the point at which Uncle Vernon's outstretched hands could resume their strangling."

"Harry ran down the stairs two at a time, coming to an abrupt halt several steps from the bottom, as long experience had taught him to remain out of arm's reach of his uncle whenever possible."

"Harry was the least surprised by this, because he had suffered periods of near starvation at the Dursleys'."

**** Thanks for listing this out.

OP's reaction is exactly why we have exaggerated Dursley abuse in fanfiction; in spite of how bad it was, people don't believe that what happened in canon was abuse so authors dial it up to eleven if they want Harry to be affected by the abuse in any real way.

**** I stand correct. Vernon was physically abusive throughout the books, and Harry was often starved while home for the summer.

Though, I still remember that Harry's reaction to the Opening Feast in book 1 was that he'd never seen so much food before, and that while the Dursley's hadn't exactly starved him, he'd never had as much food as he would have liked... though given his frame of reference was likely Dudley, I was under the impression that he was given enough each day, but not a drop more.

It's a bit of a dichotomy - Harry at 11 believes he's never been starved, but at 17, after having access to the feasts of Hogwarts and more food than he could possibly eat (especially after rooming with Ron, who loves to eat as much as he can at Hogwarts), he feels he suffered from near-starvation. Still fed, but not as much as Dudley was (but then, Dudley was habitually described as fat and large and prone to unhealthy over-eating habits).

***** It's normal for Harry to deny the abuse. He was a child, and conditioned to think that he deserved it. It was his "normal" and the way he hid it was also conditioned. And the fact that adults - especially Dumbledore - never protected him, and sent him back, all supported that their treatment was to be accepted. At heart, Harry didn't want to be a freak (an abused kid). That would have meant too much attention.

*** ....dude, Harry's treatment at the dursleys hands IS textbook phsical, mental, and emotional abuse. Keeping a kid in a cupboard is enough to get you sent away and lose custody. Not to mention they DID starve him, and vernon was noted to be physical abusive several times in the books.

*** I thought the blood wards on #4 were called wards in canon. I'm curious now. I don't have my books on me to do it now, but I want to look into that. But really, of the 7 meanings of the word 'ward' half are about protection so I don't see much difference between the terminology 'protective enchantments' and 'warding enchantments'. To each their own. Here's the link I used if you get curious and want to take a peek: [[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ward]]

**** It's the use of the word "Wards" as a field of magic that really irks me. Or as a sub-category of spells...

Like, with regards to "blood wards", that isn't so bad for me because that's actually something rare enough to use it. Plus, the official term for it is the "bond of blood charm", which is a little lengthy, os it makes sense that people would want to shorten it. If you're only using "Blood Ward" as the name of a highly-specific spell, and no-where else, then I'm fine with that.

But when you start talking about "ward" spells and "Studying and using wards", then I find that a major turn-off because that's not what those are actually called... they're not studying "wards", they're studying "Charms". All those things attributed to "Wards" are just different sorts of "Charms" and they're not a separate or sub-field of study! Saying otherwise is just failing to understand the magic-system the setting uses...

I mean, there's a reason why Bill Weasley is called a "/Curse/-Breaker" and not a "/Ward/-Breaker"!

I don't believe the word "Ward" is used anywhere in the books... not to describe any form of magic, anyways. Enchantments and Bewitchments and Charms and Jinxes and Hexes and Curses... all of those are used to describe stuff, but never are Wards used as a description for anything.

Heck, it strikes me as lazy-writing if you just say "I've put up wards on the house" when you could instead be saying something more setting-appropriate like 'I've bewitched the house with protective hexes", or similar.

***** For someone who cares this much about words you sure do use them wrongly a lot. Hexes are malign in nature, they can't be protective.

If anything, you'd need to say "I've bewitched the house with protective charms and set a few trap hexes"

****** I know. That's why it's a "weird reason". :P

Besides, some people use "protective" dark magic in the books... For example, in the sixth book, some Death Eater threw up a "cursed barrier" on the stairs-entrance to the Astronomy Tower; anyone who didn't have a Dark Mark got thrown back into the air upon contact with the invisible barrier. Bill Weasley apparently knew a similar curse which he modified to do the same thing, only with the opposite effect: anyone with a Dark Mark got blasted away and those who didn't have one could pass through.

Both Charms are technically classified as Curses given they're violent and malign in effect, but they're also used to defend an area against would-be interlopers... *shrugs*.

Similarly, Protego Diabolica is also classified as a protective spell as it protects against the caster's enemies... but is also a dark charm of horrible power because it does so by incinerating those enemies. The Curse on Marvolo Gaunt's ring is also technically "protective" because it's there to keep people from messing with it by inflicting them with the curse.

Then compare other "protective" spells like the Anti-Disapparition Jinxes that are in place around places Azkaban, keeping the inmates from simply popping out of prison. They're also part of the charms in place on Hogwarts, put up to keep students from simply disapparating off the grounds whenever they wished. A similar jinx was placed on the Crystal Cave where Voldemort hid the Locket Horcrux. It does so by ensuring that any attempt to Disapparate fails, and is mildly harmful (and thus, a Jinx). Similarly with Anti-Intruder Jinxes which would prevent intruders from entering a protected area (also on Hogwarts).

*/Shrugs/* Classification of magic is /weird/.

And of the lot, treating "Wards" as a classification of is just what inexplicably drives me bonkers.
