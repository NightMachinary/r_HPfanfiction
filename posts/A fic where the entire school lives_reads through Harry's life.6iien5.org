** Well, there are a lot of fics like that but they mostly suck. linkffn(A Dramatic Reading by White Squirrel) is probably the best fic in this trope. And another one I like is linkao3(4271982) although this one doesn't actually show the reading.

#+begin_quote
  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.

** Linkffn(The Goblet's Surprise) is vaguely along those lines.

#+begin_quote
  As part of the Triwizard Tournament, the Goblet of Fire may re-ignite after choosing the champions. This is a rare part of the choosing ceremony during which the goblet justifies its choices by showing something about each champion that influenced its decision.

*** This is the first one I thought of. The Goblet makes everyone relive the events that made Harry a good choice for Champion.

** "The Champion Reading I" by Azaelia Silmarwen fits the criteria. It was purged from fanfiction.net but can still be read on fictionhunt: [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/6813765/1]]

Haven't actually read it. Only have it bookmarked from when I was going through a 'Reading the Books' fic phase, so I can't vouch for the quality.
