I think it started in their fourth year, with the group on the Hogwart's Express, with Ron talking about how the Triwizard tournament was being made for public viewing.

I think the twins were weapon makers.

There was an author's note saying the author took everything good from the RWBY universe, which they say is just the weapons and setting.

Sorry, it's not much to go on.
