I'm looking for fics which deal in interesting ways with 'thinking' objects (preferably canon ones) that are a lot more than they seemed to be in canon. While canon makes things like the Marauders' Map, the Sorting Hat, portraits, statues, and other 'responsive' items (e.g., books like planner Hermione gives Harry) pretty much innocuous and not really "thinking for themselves", I'd love to see authors doing creative things with them. (It was the Ford Anglia in /The Boy Who Died A Lot/ and the novel interpretation of a certain portrait in /The Sum of Their Parts/ that got me thinking about this.)

I'm hoping to find stories wherein there's more to things like the statues that Minerva awakens in DH, or where popular books or even the /Daily Prophet/ have hidden/nefarious/sentient qualities.

I don't care much about who is cast as the MC, what romantic relationships there are (het and slash both okay), or time period, as long as the story is fairly well-written and avoids slavish and uninspired adherence to some of the worst tropes.

Thanks in advance. And apologies if this has been asked often; the search function is proving unhelpful.


** I'd love to read any stories like that as well.

The closest I've found is "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10390111/1/The-Riddle-of-the-Uncanny-Portrait][The Riddle of the Uncanny Portrait]]". It's an H.P. Lovecraft inspired fic that focuses on a malignant portrait.

*** It's more of an exercise caution thing rather than a forbidden thing. Ron thought they were going to fight a Troll of all things so an animated hat was probably lower on the scale of potential danger.
