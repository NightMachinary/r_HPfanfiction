** As was mentioned, Snape gets together with a minor OC.

Harry hangs out with some female pureblood classmates, but he isn't romantic with any of them. He is decidedly not romantic with Ginny. One part of pureblood customs is that the heirs of different houses never marry each other, so Harry will probably not end up with Daphne or Hermione.

Currently, Amelia Bones is considering wooing [[/spoiler][Marvolo]].

Sirius is searching for a woman he had a one-night stand with over a decade ago.

*** Sirius seems to searching for an heir more than her specifically. I got the impression he was avoiding having to marry by trying to find an heir. I like that most of the characters are wary of dealing with relationships. However, at the current pace, it doesn't seem like any of them beyond Snape will ever get there.

**** I also enjoy the slow pace of the relationships in the story. It seems more realistic that way. I like that some characters are looking for fulfilling relationships that don't revolve around physical intimacy.
