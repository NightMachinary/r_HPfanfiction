Lily, Hermoine, girl!Harry, whoever. I seem to like those more for some reason. Anybody else with this little trait?


** I don't have that problem - I have a problem with the smugness the most common male protagonist exhibit in certain cases. Specifically, this is common with James Potter, Sirius Black, Draco and Lucius Malfoy, and most of all, super!Harry. Most writers have those characters so busy patting themselves on the back so much it makes me ill.

I'm not saying they're all badly written or that I can't read any of them... but it gets so annoying in 90% of those stories that I just won't pick up a random super!Harry story unless people give me ridiculous levels of assurance.

*** Well, 99% of super!Harry stories are self-insert power fantasies, so it's not really surprising. I can't stand most of them either.

And don't get me started on all the fics where Sirius gets out of Azkaban and within weeks is fully recovered from /twelve years of psychological torture and deprivation/ and all the ladies swoon over him.

** I think the fact that the worst fics out there have annoying, shallow, sexist male protagonists might help tilt my opinion in this direction. Likewise, some of the best stories I've ever read had a female Harry or OC. But I think it is far more critical to have well-written, plot important, and self-motivated female characters overall than have the protagonist be female.

Far too often, a story has a strong male Harry and wallpaper female characters. Oh, but the author isn't sexist: they gave Hermione a magic sword. Not as nice as Harry's, of course, and she only really brings it out to help him and not for any of her own goals or objectives. Hell, she hardly talks in the story unless it is to talk about Harry, and they're attached by the hip and never leave one-another's side.

Yeah. That's the shit I'm talking about.

Those sorts of characterizations for females get boring fast. As stories with strong female protagonists can't help but have more focus on well-explored motivations for female characters, I think that makes them more interesting. The author there has at least thought about what half of the population of the world has going on in their own heads and the objectives they have. In those stories, at least one person without a penis can have adventures and lead exciting lives of their own volition, without having to be dragged from place to place by Harry, or rescued by Harry, or magically bound to Harry's every whim, or...

Assuming that we are both thinking about a fic with an avian title, the really sad thing is that the author, in all evidence, actually thinks very, very well of Hermione. With friends like that...

****** Haha, I remember that now.

I don't recall a magic sword, but that's probably because I quit on about chapter 3 when 11-year old 'Harry Crow' showed up Dumbledore, Malfoy, and the Minister of Magic all at once, or something to that effect.

** I'm not unable, but I do highly prefer female protagonists when reading fics. Almost all of my favorites have them. The only time I don't seem to care is Marauder era. It can be anyone except a Peter or Serverus and I'm likely going to be fine with it.

** I absolutely PREFER female protags in most that I read and write. I can't really explain it, but I just tend to find female characters more interesting. Hence why my first HPverse fic is focused on Daphne Greengrass taking Harry's place rather than focusing on a more canon-compliant story.

** Not that I can tell, there's going to be good and bad stories regardless of who the protagonist is and I haven't noticed a quality difference of the good stories that feature a female protagonist vs good stories that feature a male protagonist. Maybe you can portray yourself as the main character in a female protagonist fic better?

** I don't have a problem with male protagonists. I have a problem with female supporting characters when there's a male protagonist. I understand that, when you're dating Harry Potter, his needs will rate rather highly in your priorities -- he has trouble surviving most years -- but there's a fair bit of downtime.

/The Lie I've Lived/ has a fair treatment of both Hermione (she's interested in helping Harry, but academics and the academic portions of the Tournament take up most of her time) and Fleur (she's interested in Harry but has the Tournament and her own broom racing career as priorities and is looking for someone who's willing to follow along during her career). I can't hold that up as a shining example for reasons obvious to anyone who's read it.

** I don't really; if the fic is well written then it doesn't matter who the protagonist is. However, I will be more inclined to find female protagonist-fics simply because I associate with them more (I'm female).

So it's not that they're better written, I just connect better to female characters. Especially Hermione, who is a lot like me. However, what matters most is how it's written.
