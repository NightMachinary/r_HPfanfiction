Listen, I love Marauders-era fanfics, especially ones centered around James and Lily. But one thing that drives me absolutely /insane/ is the fact that so many people constantly misrepresent James and Sirius.

This isn't just an issue with Snape fans either (surprisingly). Plenty of Marauders fans still get their characters wrong.

Let me explain. It's mentioned several times throughout the series that James and Sirius were the best at everything they did, topping their classes without even trying. You only have to look at their resume to know that this is true. In SWM, James and Sirius finish their Defense O.W.L. early and don't even need to review for Transfiguration because they already know everything. They were able to successfully brew the highly-complicated Animagus potion at just fifteen years old, and they had mastered the transformation by then as well. McGonagall herself says how brilliant they were, and we know she doesn't give praise lightly.

Yet in almost every single Marauders fanfic I've read, James and Sirius are always portrayed as lazy idiots who need Remus to get them through their exams.

And I just...how? How can you read the entire series and still come away thinking, "Yep, James and Sirius were just dumb jocks"? I can only imagine that the people who use this trope /haven't/ actually read the books because there's literally no logical explanation.


** There is the same problem with Peter. In the few fics I have read (not a big fan of the "Maraudeur era", he is often depicted as a complete idiot, more of a follower of the Maraudeurs than a true friend.

But this is not the case at all. In canon, he was chosen as Lily and James Secret Keeper, which makes him their "2nd best choice" after Sirius. Before this, he spied the Order for Voldemort a whole year befer ever being suspected. When Sirius cornered him, he managed to escape while framing him for his crimes. He managed to find Voldemort in Albania, brought him back in Britain and played a vital role in his return. Even as a student, he managed to Master a very difficult branch of Magic while in 5th year, that he did it with help doesn't change the fact that it is very impressive.

Peter is good, maybe not as good as Sirius, James or Snape (who are all extremely talented), but he is still an extremely dangerous wizard who should be able to look down on 80% of Magical Britain.

**** I think people mix up 'cowardly' and 'sniveling' with 'stupid.' As far as we see, Peter is never stupid. He betrays his friends and frames Sirius under Dumbledore's nose with no one the wiser, he avoids detection for twelve years, and then he almost singlehandedly brings Voldemort back to power when he decides that Voldemort is his best option for protection.

He's a weak-willed coward who would prefer to live as a family pet for twelve years than possibly risk his treachery being discovered, he would prefer to sign the death-warrant of his oldest and dearest friends than to risk death himself, and he would prefer to bring a genocidal maniac back to power than risk maybe having no protection if he's ever found again after being discovered. All of these things are cowardly, sniveling, weak-willed things to do, but none of them are stupid. His goal is to stay alive at all costs, and he serves that goal with intelligence and focus.

******** Very different tone, though. Book Ron is being mean and sarcastic, as he do, and Movie Ron is bitingly cruel. "You have no family" is what pushes it over the edge, when Movie Ron maxed out his asshole-o-meter and made it a stark difference between the mediums in his characterization.

********* I think you're right that it does carry a different tone. "Harry's and Hermione's parents are out of the way" is less direct and cold than straight up "Your parents are dead and you're alone in the world, best-friend-of-seven-years." But I think that the book line carries a tone of complete thoughtlessness versus the movie line carrying a tone of lashing out, and I'm not so sure that's better.

Book Ron wasn't an idiot, but he was thoughtless. Movie Ron was pretty much an idiot, but he wasn't mean (except when it came to Hermione). The best Movie Ron can muster at Harry when he's angry is 'piss off' in Goblet of Fire. It leaves that DH scene in the movie with the implication that Ron is being changed by the amulet, whereas the DH scene in the book is left with the implication that the amulet just exacerbates what's already there. I'd personally find it easier to accept that my normally kind friend became cruel when wearing a cursed object, than to accept that my normally thoughtless friend revealed they half forgot a seminal tragedy in my life and thought it was chill to act like I had no skin in the game because of it. One can be blamed on the object entirely, and one can't be.

You can't assume your reader's frame of reference and even though you don't have to rewrite the books every time you write fanfiction, it's better to reiterate the details that are important to your story than to assume that the reader just knows them.

- brews the potion to turn voldemort into a baby
- gets a cauldron and ingredients in a country he doesnt speak the language
- kills a unicorn, as voldemort says unicorn blood is an ingredient
- subdues bertha jorkins
- carries voldemort with him throughout europe as a baby (!!! how did he do this)
- subdues moody with barty - who has been imperiused for years.
- brews the polyjuice
- brews the resurrection potion
- cuts off his own hand

**** Not to be a nitpicker or anything but did we ever get confirmation that Peter went to the Europe part of Albania? Because AFAIK Albania was a reference to Scotland, From wikipedia:\\
Albania (Scotland)

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alba][Alba]], a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goidelic_languages][Gaelic]] name for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland][Scotland]], may be related to the Greek name of Britain [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albion][Albion]], Latinized as /Albania/ during the High Medieval period, and later passed into Middle English as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany_(disambiguation][Albany]]). Some recent scholarship has however connected it with one of the early names of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland][Ireland]], "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fodla][Fodla]]", which is taken to mean (land of the) "going down" (of the Sun), in contrast to Alba which means (land of the) "rising" (of the Sun). This is consistent with one of the ancient emblems of Scotland consisting of a rising sun crossing the horizon, a symbol laden with much significance.

*** My head cannon is that Peter is pretty good at Potions. There is no indication that the other Marauders are brilliant at it, and a specific, probably complicated potion is needed for the Animagus transformation. I always liked the idea that Peter was the one to brew it, and he was a really good potioneer, but he was clearly overshadowed by Snape and Lily. Giving him a bigger inferiority complex, since the area he excels at doesn't bring him much recognition since he unfortunately shares a class with two extraordinary potion makers. What sparked this idea was the "potion" he makes to give Voldemort back his body, that was probably not easy, and Voldemort couldn't really help.

He had no problem immediately casting the Killing Curse (which we're told requires intense hatred and intent-to-murder) on command against a random teenager. That kind of proficiency with that kind of magic doesn't just happen out of nowhere for anything even approaching a decent human being.

Also consider that the very first thing he does on getting the silver hand is test out how powerful it is. While fear and survival may have been /part/ of his motivation in joining Voldemort, there was clearly also some desire for power or similar.

It's because of this that I find highly plausible the frequent fanfic depiction that at Hogwarts he tended to encourage the Marauders' crueler sides.

I can see their egos enjoying having someone who isn't as brilliant and charismatic as them, and him being a follower, but that doesn't mean they don't consider him a friend.

My head canon is that James and Sirius are the besties, Peter follows but is genuinely funny and provides comic relief, and Remus they kind of look after a bit and definitely don't listen to when he tries to rein the mischief - but that doesn't mean any of them aren't considered proper friends. Considering they have some big secrets between them, they're going to have that bond anyway even if they bring different things to the table.

** "Yet in almost every single Marauders fanfic I've read, James and Sirius are always portrayed as lazy idiots who need Remus to get them through their exams."

This is exactly how writers portray Harry and Ron in relation to Hermione too, and in both instances it's so far from the truth and very annoying to read. James and Sirius are described as brilliant and talented even more frequently than Remus, and quite possibly going beyond Hermione's level as well, considering the Map and the complex magic behind it.

I must say, I was pleased with your Transfiguration mark, Potter, very pleased. Now, why haven't you applied to continue with Potions? I thought it was your ambition to become an Auror?'

  A few minutes later, *Ron was cleared to do the same subjects as Harry*, and the two of them left the table together.

We know McGonagall doesn't take students who passed Transfiguartion with an A.

#+begin_quote

** I wonder about this a fair bit, and I think a lot of people are missing a crucial aspect of James and Sirius - they're both from well monied, old families.

If you've spent time around these types of families IRL, their children can be cheeky, or bratty, or bullies, or laddish, or popular - but their families tend to pay a lot of money on tutoring. Tutoring, and a high social value on education as a source of power and social status, which they pass on to kids usually.

Which is interesting, because then you get what seem like jock types (to use the Americanism) who score effortlessly well in academics. Sirius going to live with James eventually, and leaving home during school, would have helped support him staying top of his year effortlessly if they still got tutoring at James' place, or even had access to interesting resources that kept their attention and helped keep them motivated and mischievous.

I always think of this, because JKR very intentionally made some parallels between James and Draco. Draco was second to hermione in the year, and he wasn't known to be studious or nerdy. He probably had access to a library, tutors maybe, and general access to things like sports, trips, and other things that would incidentally educate and keep him interested in magic. So yeah - when I see what you describe in fanfics it makes me realise that JKR made very interesting characters but some parts of them were made subtle; she doesn't batter you over the head with these background facts.

Draco whined that it wasn't his fault his grades weren't the best in the class because the teachers all had favorites and Hermione was used as an example.

This implies that it's more than just Hermione who's getting better marks than him.

That said, we do see Draco in N.E.W.T level Potions, for which he would have needed an Outstanding had Snape still been the teacher, so he is definitely skilled there, as Snape's favoritism would not have been a factor on the O.W.L exam.

Edit: After Hermione Granger, Draco implies there are other students ahead of him. From what we see in canon, I suspect Ernie MacMillan was one of them, as /Order of the Phoenix/ notes that he considers studying for /seven/ hours to be not enough time.

Personally, I think this might be because a lot of people who write marauders era really like Remus, and that's why he consciously or subconsciously gets powered up, which means everyone around him needs to be taken down a notch. This has led to a lot of really good, in depth portrayals of Remus, which are fascinating to read, but those stories rarely feature the James or Sirius we see in the books. Might also be closer to the film portrayals of them all, and same with Snape?

I used to be mostly indifferent to him, but nowadays I quite like him with all of his flaws (less so when he's made into the smartest guy in the room). I am one of those people who prefer marauders era fanfiction over anything else, and there are a lot of ones that focus on Remus's character, presumably because he, with a bit of stage diection and the right lighting, makes for an excellent tragic hero. But he definitely loses his charm if you try to explain away his flaws, in particular his cowardice which is such a big point in the books.

****** Ah well I've got quite niche taste nowadays, but thanks for asking :) I seem to grow pickier after every fic I read so I don't know how much stock you should put in my recommendations.

Like many people here and elsewhere I'm very fond of theDivineComedian, on ffn and ao3. Remus is, I think it's fair to say, a favourite of this author as well but his portrayal is very believable I find. The Age of Lies describes all of the marauders well. What's unusual about this author is the quality of the stories and the plots and the atmosphere they manage to create, and their take on canon dark creatures and potions.

I saw that Anthem for Doomed Youth was already recommended further up in this thread, and I would second that recommendation. LucyInTheSkye is the author of that, I think only on AO3. They have one more long story that's really good. I think here, the plot is decent and it's jam-packed with funny details, but the characters are what make their stuff excellent, the marauders really feel like real people you might have known in a previous life. Also it's a refreshing take on young people partying and dating and getting into trouble, comparing it to what I remember of my teens it hits a rare note of authenticity.

For a third author I would go with lyin, also on AO3. Glass of Water is really popular and has a great Lily, but my fave stuff from that author is a short series of fics from the first wizarding war when they're out of school. It's also a great use of Dirk Cresswell, I don't think I've seen him used much elsewhere.

** I think it's because JKR is very inconsistent with power levels. Just think of Patronus -- first it is said most adult wizards and witches have problems casting it and then Harry successfully teaches a bunch of teenagers how to cast a corporeal Patronus in a few months (if not weeks). In the end it's hard to decipher what's (and who're) supposed to be advanced and what's (who're) not.

And frankly, there's either too many ‚Äòbrilliant' characters or ‚Äòbrilliant' is an exaggeration and they're all just above average.

Marauders -- the map, became animagi at fifteen; Snape -- potion genius, said to know more about Dark Magic as first year than seventh years, created highly useful spells while student; Lily -- though I don't think being a part of Slug Club reflects someone's academic/magical achievements accurately, she's also often described as brilliant ; Twins -- created a huge variety of original products, not just jocks but also things useful in war, all while students; Bill, Percy, Barty Crouch Jnr -- all got 12 OWLs; Death Eaters in general seem to be able to match aurors who are basically wizarding special forces.

Additionally, in fanfiction authors tend to take those ‚Äòbrilliant' characters and make them good at absolutely everything. Plus add to them those we don't have much reliable information on but who are generally considered smart/powerful/talented by fandom -- Bella, Draco, Dolohov often described as Charm Master or something similar, then there's Theo Nott and Daphne in Slytherin fics or Regulus and Lucius if it's Marauders era. In the end we're left with a crowd of geniuses, to the point where you're sorry to the rest of the kids who goes in school with them.

I think the best way to go about it is to use ‚ÄòNeville route'. Neville was very good at herbology and not very good at everything else. So instead of making everyone prodigies why not say James and Sirius were very talented in Transfiguration and were average in Potions and sucked at Astronomy? Why not make Snape a genius when it comes to Potions, average in DADA and struggling in Transfiguration?

  Lily, she's also often described as brilliant
#+end_quote

Eh, she's overhyped for sure. The only people that really see describe her is one professor - Slughorn, only in regard to potions. If memory serves me right, Francis the Fish is movie canon, not books. The other one is Hagrid, who's the original hype man. We get zero achievements from her in her scholarly career other than apparently being Head Girl, with no motive to it. She obviously had a good standing in academics but that doesn't imply anything stellar like Hermione. Otherwise, she had control of her magic when young, albeit on a less powerful scale than Riddle.

Now contrast this knowledge to what has already been said about Sirius (who's also described as talented by Slughorn, his potions professor) and James. In fanfiction, she's often portrayed as this brilliant generalist who's published in research at eighteen, much like Dumbledore as she simultaneously guides Sirius and James when they try to cast a simple summoning charm. Her talent is blown out of proportion when likely she was on par with Tonks or Cedric Diggory or some other talented student who's better than most in their year, but nothing stellar. Think of Harry had he been dedicated to studying, something similar I feel.

In the same vein is Regulus Black. The bloke was obviously extremely intelligent to be able to figure out that the locket was a horcrux, that denotes intelligence that's mightily above average, and a hint of curiosity. However, why does this also immediately translate to 'would wipe the floor with anybody in a fight'? Or worse, 'he could give Voldemort a run for his money'. He could've just been well versed in history, dark magic and a bit of defense to get where he was at when he died.

It depends on how broad it is. It obviously isn't as silly as a sugar quill...but it also isn't like stepping toe to toe with him.

Problem is that to have her managing it basically just out of Hogwarts she would need to be a Naruto-style genius (mastering incredibly advanced techniques while still on diapers, having partial omniscience to the point of knowing extremely obscure and forgotten lore that no one else has any inking to, managing to defeat and kill opponents that by all rights should have been able to wipe the floor with them...), alternatively she can be made to be a savant at one specific area that lets her manage that feat while being average at the rest, but this generally offers far less potential to work with.

Additionally, Harry's Patronus isn't just impressive because it's corporeal, but because it's incredible powerful. At the end of Deathly Hallows, Harry is able to create a Patronus which dispels a group of Dementors that 6 other members of the D.A can barely hold back with their combined Patronus Charms.

Just like how in our world, not everyone is taught e.g. bear safety or how to kill lions and tigers, when you live somewhere where it's vanishingly unlikely you'd encounter one.

There's also the fact that Hogwarts had an ever-changing DADA staff, so this could also be a reason why most students didn't develop good practical DADA skills.

I never know how much stock I put in magical /power/ per se, because it's so fluid in how its presented and represented. Given that the Patronus comes from confidence and belief - hope, even - I guess I always took Harry being able to have a particularly strong one more as a thematic indicator of /who/ Harry is as a person more than /how strong, magically/ Harry is compared to other students.

** I guess laziness is an easier flaw than characterising them as arrogant bullies... main characters are typically likeable and it's easy to like the playful slacker (or the tortured escaped prisoner), but James and Sirius are /mean/... Draco, but competent and popular. Not everyone is a stickler for canon compliance.

I'm also pretty sure a big part of the problem is that we basically live on scraps of information about pretty much everything in those days (other than Snape's relationship with Lilly). And some of it's fairly contradictory. Like, we know that all purebloods are related but we also know that James and Sirius are very distantly related (if at all) and that they didn't know each other before Hogwarts. (Which gets even weirder when we remember that the Blacks tend to look like each other and how familiar Draco and Ron are with who's who. The Marauders were only at school twenty years earlier... that's not a lot of time for that kind of cultural shift.)

Of course, people can just get wrapped up in fanfiction and/or fanon. For my part, I can't think for the life of me where playboy Sirius comes from but it's a trope that's everywhere. I don't even remember why he's usually seen to be straight either (disclaimer: I do not ship Wolfstar... I mean that I literally can't think of any indications about Sirius' sexuality in any direction). If I was to do a Marauder's at school fanfic, it'd rely pretty much entirely on my headcanons... maybe with the occasional reference to HP Wiki... which are informed by some of the fanfics I've read.

That being said, the one that always gets me is the idea that Frank and Alice were friends with (or even substantially similar in age) Lily and James at school. Very common fanfic trope.

** A really brilliant teenager can be lazy. Think the Weasley twins: both brilliant, both push magic far beyond the Hogwarts curriculum for their age, neither is known as an academic prodigy and both are troublemakers.

Simply put, such teenagers aren't challenged by the school's content, so they just skim through homework and lessons.

** There is a large chance they haven't read the books. The movies don't really cover this aspect. Or at least I don't remember them covering it. All I can't remember was they were great aurors and James was great at transfiguration and they were douche bags to Snape. Personally, i haven't read the books, so I always saw them as jocks, maybe not dumb jocks but still jocks. If u haven't read the books and only have the movies to go on it is entirely reasonable to assume they are any number of things because of the lack of covering the characters in them.

** I think most of the bad characterizations the Marauders get come from people who, like Canon Snape, were never able to see that they grew up from their school days or that they had redeemable qualities (they weren't universally hated). And they let Snape's bias color their fics. So they get a lot of negative traits and often villainized by writers.

** I don't know about their brilliance to be honest. They weren't even in the Slug Club, /Lily/ was; every achievement they had (the map, becoming animagi) was shared by Peter, who is supposedly thick-headed and comparable to Neville, and the only people who say they were ~brilliant~ are people looking at them through rose-tinted glasses.

Remus (who can cast a patronus, and who is seen multiple times arguing his case well in front of others), Lily (Slug Club member, Slughorn's favorite, can cast a patronus, /achieved unassisted flight at the age of NINE/), and Severus (can cast a patronus, invents his own spells, rewrites the 6th year textbook in his fifth year, possibly the world's greatest occlumens) are demonstrably bright and talented. James and Sirius, not so much. I'd even go as far as saying Sirius is alarmingly stupid in many of his decisions before and after Azkaban, and while we do see them bragging about how they don't need to study, we don't actually see their test scores.

*** There are any number of reasons they weren't in the Slug Club. It's entirely possible they simply didn't want to be in the Slug Club, or that Slughorn didn't want them because of their personalities rather than their talents. I can't see Sirius being interested in fancy parties, and inviting known troublemakers and bullies makes for a bad party I would imagine. James and Sirius just aren't around in the story much to say one way or another, and certainly not enough to make as much of an impression as Remus, Snape, or Lily.

***** Doylist explanation: Rowling has already focused on James for five books prior to HBP, and suddenly remembered Harry had a mother that did more than die for him, so she had to develop her at least the tiniest bit before she did the big reveal in Deathly Hallows. This allowed her to create less of a shock towards why Snape loves her so much, in due accordance with the potions connection as well. Rowling wanted the limelight to shine away from James for a bit.

Watsonian: Maybe Slughorn just didn't like James due to something he had down prior to that. Alternatively, as is with popular theory, old Sluggy had a rivalry with his father. Fleamont Potter being a potioneer that was in the age range as Slughorn, they might have been very competitive, with bad blood. A tamer version of Snape's hatred of Harry.

*** i mean its not like James and Sirius were there to instruct Peter on how to become an animagus, and even then Peter is far too underrated by the fandom, he's a far above average wizard, capable of tricking numerous oblivator squads shortly after Voldemorts death to fake his death and frame his friend.

Its pretty clear from what we know that both James and Sirius were good wizards after graduating from hogwarts, James for instance defying Voldemort three times, heavily indicated that it was surival in combat.

**** Yeah the main sentiment here seems to be that Peter did what they did and Peter was /said to be/ bad. What is said isn't what we obviously see with our own two eyes. It's like the phrase actions speak louder than words. Maybe Peter had everybody fooled as an untalented person, as we clearly see him doing extremely complex magic. Would you trust people's testimonies or what you see somebody do with their own eyes? Besides, what is most obvious here is that Peter was said to be bad at /duelling/ - something we never see him do - and transfiguration; the animagus transformation turned out to be mostly potions...

It seems rather obvious to me he was lacking in a few respects but wasn't an overall idiot.

**** I agree that Peter is far too underrated, but that's exactly my point. He outsmarted Sirius at every turn, and was much more effective than people gave him credit for. He was able to appear trustworthy to the Potters and to Sirius, he was able to spy for a year without getting caught, he was able to think quickly on his feet to come up with an impeccable plan after Voldy died, he was able to then elude Sirius for a year and then finally escape narrowly once more, and resurrect Voldemort.

I'm not saying James and Sirius weren't powerful wizards, I'm saying they weren't the phenomenal, brilliant wizards they're made out to be; as for the "thrice defied him" thing, JKR confirmed that one of those times was simply by refusing to join Voldy, which is great and all but doesn't indicate survival in combat.
