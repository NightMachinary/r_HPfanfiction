So, I'm running short on novel length fics on ff.net so I thought I'd give Ao3 a browse. Honestly what the heck is with the stories there? Every second fic is slash, rape, BDSM or some other extreme!

I haven't had any luck finding an appealing fic so far. Any recommendations that aren't slash or the above?

Darker Harry, and combat fics preferred!


** Much easier to exclude tags than search for others.

In the "other tags" or "search within results" boxes put a minus in front of whatever you want to avoid.

ex: -slash -mpreg -"quotation marks for more than one word"

** You /can/ filter out tags on AO3, using the 'search within results' box. stick a - in front of anything you don't want (with quotation marks if it's more than one word) and it'll filter it out. /-"Draco Malfoy/Harry Potter" -"non-con" -mpreg/ for example. You can also use the 'other tags' box (not the exact wording, but similar) to search for Dark Harry fics. With a little tweaking, AO3's tagging system is easily navigable.

Besides which, being able to search for things like /Alternate Universe - Canon Divergence/ gives it an automatic leg-up on FFN, which has a god-awful filter system.

** When FFN started cracking down on fics with more extreme content, a lot of them moved to AO3. Plus it's practically impossible to effectively search on AO3 since they allow unlimited tags and authors seem to be competing over who can apply the most tags to their story.
