So I've tried to get into this fic a couple of times, only to get distracted by something else and forget about it. I think my main problem with getting into it is that I don't understand the AU at all, and the summary provides no help whatsoever in understanding whats going on. Could someone give me a quick background on why Harry seems to have been adobpted by the Blacks?


** So I don't want to spoil anything as this is actually something that is discovered around 300k words into the fic and also explains why Harry hates Professor Prewett. I would recommend reading and finding out, but I will explain to the best of my ability.

Summary of Harry being adopted by the Blacks:

Remus and Sirius have joint custody of Harry after his parents death. The ministry/Pillars decide that Harry the last scion of the Potters should not be raised by someone as Dark as a Black and strongarm Remus into signing Harry's custody over to him. Sirius is pushed out of guardianship and goes/begs to Arcturus for help even though they are estranged. Sirius, Regulus, and Arcturus assault the house Harry is staying in guarded by 20 aurors/ministry personnel. Regulus is hurt rather badly, and we don't really know what happened to Sirius yet (I have a theory), but the Blacks are successful in retrieving Harry. Regulus's house is later raided by ministry. He and his family are disarmed, and while they are helpless as their house burns down Prewett kills Regulus and his family. This is one of the reasons Harry hates Prewett (murder of Prewett's wife is the other)

As to the entire AU:

After the fall of Grindelwald a group of predominantly Light families (the Pillars) took over the political scene of Wizarding Britain. (Voldemort never rose in this story) The Blacks are as dark as they come and are soon Pariahs as the Light families take over Britain. However they are not truly out of the picture as they remain wealthy and still have influence. Houses such as the Lestranges (minor Dark houses) are their only real allies left. Harry giving up the Potter name is important as he chose to join a Dark house, both insulting the Pillars and becoming a social outcast willingly.

I didn't really do either of those justice and I may have made an error somewhere but I did the best I could on short notice. Black Luminary is my favourite ongoing fic and I believe the most promising AU the fandom has seen since the Firebird Trilogy. It is a must read in my book.

If I need to elaborate somewhere or clarify something let me know.

*** Thanks, the summary of the story makes a lot more sense in that context.

**** There are lots of parts that I don't even understand yet; the author has done a great job of slowly giving us pieces of the puzzle. The whole Prewett thing is still unresolved as we know there is a bit more to it.

Part of the "mystery" of this fic is we still don't really know what happens, even at the current point. The overview I gave you still has holes in it. Specifically what happened to Sirius? My theory is due to the estrangement between Acturus and Sirius the condition for rescuing Harry was that he would be raised as Black by Acruturus and Sirius would not be able to interfere. Sirius being desperate agrees and after he is rescued is not present in his life due to the agreement.

The whole arc involving Lethifolds is some of the most creative work I've ever seen and is absolutely phenomenal. Aenor Rose is a very well done OC, and someone I find very intriguing. There is a lot going on (it is an AU after all) but the world building is solid and the author is creating something that has never been done before.

**** It's actually heavily implied that Sirius is imprisoned. And the whole deal with Prewett is a lot more complicated. The fates of Regulus' family is important, along with why Prewett's wife was murdered. Also, there really are three factions in the story so far. You have the Darkers, with a split between the Selwyns and Blacks, who backed Grindelwald (and Voldemort never rose to power), and lost, the Pillars, who were pureblooded families who were against Grindelwald and are in control (and they're split into two factions internally), and then the Muggleborns, some of which recognise that for all of the laws that help out Muggleborns and Half-bloods, and all of the support from the Ministry and Pillars, are still actually being controlled by the Pillars.

** Ok, so. I think it is extremely well written, interesting and well thought. That said, the way YakAge leaves us in the dark is annoying to me, particularly. It is an excellent fanfic, but I think that I will be reading it when it is completed. Every time there's a new chapter I feel like i have to read the previous ten to understand. That's not to say i hate it, as I stated my appreciation earlier, just that the way information is presented is not my cup of butterbeer.
