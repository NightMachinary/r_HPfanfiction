** Ive seen some bits of this sprinkled around some fanfics. Nothing quite so on the dot though. Some have learn more from the champions but he is also way ahead of them in combat and magic power in most. It would be interesting, the grey magic of the north, the infused body magic like the veela. I dont think Ive seen a Potter fic around the 4th book to have harry want to learn more

** There are many fics that put pressure on learning magic overall, like linkffn(A Cadmean Victory) that takes place in 4th yr and has some blood magic in it, but sadly they don't describe precisely different forms of magic from different cultures just the desire to learn

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
