  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** Tons, I'll link some later.

Edit: Might have exaggerated with the whole ”tons”. But there are a few. Although most is Harry being immortal through rebirth (while keeping his memories) or some sort of timetravel connected to his death. My recommendations: linkffn ( Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is By: Tsume Yuki )

linkffn ( Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time By: joe6991 ) This is a truly excellent one. Just read it and was hypnotized into reading it nonstop for days.

This is two right off the top of my head. I'll edit again if I remember any other ones.

** linkffn(8337871) Unfortunately incomplete (and likely abandoned). It's one of my favorites, though, and still worth a read, I think. You don't have to see the movie to understand the story (I haven't haha).

#+begin_quote
  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future.

#+end_quote

The fic is only loosely based on the movie's premise. Honestly, caliing it a crossover is presumptuous. The works are pretty much entirely separate. You definitely don't need to see the movie to see the fic, and you aren't going to spoil the movie by reading the fic.

On a side note, watch the movie. It's great.

** I misread this as asking about FICS that are long-lived or immortal, not Harry...

Judging by how long some fics go between updates, or how long many fics get (some of them quite good), that would be a longer list :)
