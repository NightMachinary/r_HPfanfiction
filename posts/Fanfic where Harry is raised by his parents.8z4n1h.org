*** What /is/ Prince of the Dark Kingdom about anyway? It seems as though Voldemort won from the summary but if Harry is raised by his parents then how exactly does Voldemort really like him? I see people praising it left and right but I never actually know what's the story about.

**** Harry's parents ran to Germany before Voldemort got to them and lived there for ten years before they died. Because the spell never rebounded Voldemort won the war, and isn't horrifically disfigured to boot.

Voldy has more character development than just "evil" and and kinda takes Harry under his wing. The story is about Harry's schoolyears as what is essentially the prince of Voldemorts Kingdom.

  Could a chance meeting change history? What would a different Halloween in 1981 mean for wizarding Britain?

** AidanChase on Ao3 has a marvelous AU series, literally titled “The One Where Everyone Lives” or something to that extent. I will try and link it for you - but it's hard to find because each of the books in the series is literally just named HP and the sorcerers stone, HP and the chamber of secrets, etc. it's up to OotP iirc

  A Hogwarts experience where Harry has people actually helping him face his destiny. Features a greater good Dumbledore, a tormented Snape, a free Sirius, and parents that lived. Read as Harry becomes the next great leader of the light with his friends and family helping him along the way. Plot line follows canon for most part but with several key changes. H/HR. Super H & Voldemort
