** They Spend Much Of Their Time Arguing With Each Other
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: they-spend-much-of-their-time-arguing-with-each-other
   :END:
In both the books and the movies, Ron and Hermione spend a lot of time together. But when they are together, they spend much of that time arguing and bickering over various things. This is because they are two very completely different people, with different ideas and different goals.

One can only imagine what they're like now that they're married. Do they argue all the time? How does that affect their children?

*Their entire relationship seems to be about arguing.*

No matter what, that kind of bickering does not make for a healthy relationship.

** Hermione Was Always Closer To Harry
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: hermione-was-always-closer-to-harry
   :END:
While Hermione was often yelling at Ron and telling him what an idiot he was, she had a much closer and healthier relationship with Harry. Hermione had respect for Harry, although she never showed much respect for Ron - especially in the films, where many of Ron's big moments in the books went to Hermione.

*She confided in Harry, even when she wouldn't consider telling Ron her deepest and darkest secrets and fears.*

Hermione also seemed to spend more time with Harry and was always the first person to defend him, even though Ron was the one she eventually fell for.

Ron Is Really Immature, Especially When Compared To Hermione

Everyone has heard the statement that girls mature faster than boys, although it's probably more due to society giving boys that as an excuse than anything else.

Hermione starts out at Hogwarts already very mature. She stays that way as she grows older. Someone has to, right? Ron, on the other hand, remains immature, not just throughout his years at Hogwarts, but well into his adulthood, as seen in /Harry Potter and the Cursed Child./

In fact, it seems that Ron never bothered to grow up, something that Hermione would probably dislike. For some reason, the two are still together, in spite of that.

** Hermione Conjured Birds To Attack Ron
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: hermione-conjured-birds-to-attack-ron
   :END:
Hermione and Ron spend a lot of time being mean to each other. Besides arguing a lot, Hermione once completely crossed the line when she tried to hurt Ron.

*Hermione was so jealous of Ron's relationship with Lavender that she used the oppugno curse to conjure birds to attack viciously attack him.*

That's not something you do to someone you profess to love, is it? Also, how could Ron possibly love her back after she did something so unbelievably cruel? This is just another one of those things about their relationship that doesn't make sense.

** Ron's Unfair Expectations Of Hermione
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: rons-unfair-expectations-of-hermione
   :END:
Sure, Ron is a heroic and loyal friend, and served as good comedic fodder in the movies, but he is certainly not good boyfriend material. Ron has concrete ideas about what girls should and shouldn't be, and they are quite reductive and outdated.

He mocks Hermione for being so studious because girls aren't supposed to be. It was as if she was expected to continually apologize for who she was because Ron didn't think she fit into an idealize box for how girls should behave. As fans know, Hermione Granger is not one to be put in any box.

** Rupert Grint Believed They Would Get Divorced
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: rupert-grint-believed-they-would-get-divorced
   :END:
After filming the movies, one of the actors began to question the relationship that Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger had with each other. Rupert Grint, the actor who portrays Ron, even went on to say that he believed that [[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/aaron-sagers/exclusive-rupert-grint-an_b_9143366.html?utm_hp_ref=entertainment&ir=Entertainment][Ron and Hermione would end up divorced]] and that Ron would end up lonely somewhere on his own.

Regardless of Grint's opinions, when /Harry Potter and the Cursed Child/ came out, the two were still together, and married, with a daughter and son. That play even made it clear that the marriage between the two probably should have never happened.

** The Alternate Timeline Where Hermione Is Bitter
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: the-alternate-timeline-where-hermione-is-bitter
   :END:
Hermione is a strong and independent female character. She has often shown that she does not need anyone to help her reach her goals and ambitions. One might think this would also apply to her adult life. Sure, she loves Ron and marries him. They even have two children together, but that doesn't mean that her life would suck without him.

In /Harry Potter and the Cursed Child/, an alternate timeline shows Hermione without Ron.

*In that timeline, Hermione is a failure in her life because she never met and fell in love with Ron.*

How does that even make sense for the Hermione that fans know?

** Ron Resents Hermione For Being So Smart
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: ron-resents-hermione-for-being-so-smart
   :END:
Hermione is brilliant. The books and movies established this from the time she first appeared. Ron is not very smart, at least not in an educational environment. Ron seems to feel stupid, especially when he is around Hermione. But instead of being okay with that, he resents it, and it comes across in a lot of the things that he says and does.

Ron makes little off-handed comments about her being brainy. When Hermione does something intelligent, he sits in the background and mopes. As already mentioned, he is very immature, and it comes across in the resentment that he has for Hermione.

** They Have Completely Opposite Personalities
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: they-have-completely-opposite-personalities
   :END:
The /Harry Potter/ books and movies quickly establish that Ron and Hermione don't have much in common - form their backgrounds to their interests. Not only that, but the two have entirely different personalities.

*Hermione is serious and studious. Ron is goofy and hates to study.*

Hermione has ambitions that go beyond her time at Hogwarts. Ron has no idea what he wants to do when he grows up.

Although some fans might argue that this is a case of opposites attracting, it is not a good example of what to base a long-term romantic relationship on. As seen in /Harry Potter and the Cursed Child/, these are still issues with the couple today.

** Ron's Treatment Of Hermione After The Yule Ball
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: rons-treatment-of-hermione-after-the-yule-ball
   :END:
One of the biggest incidents in Ron and Hermione's past is the Yule Ball. Apparently, the two wanted to go together, but Ron didn't have the courage to ask Hermione until the last minute. By then, Viktor Krum had already asked Hermione, and she told him yes. This made Ron angry, although he had no right to feel that way.

*Ron gets jealous and starts treating Hermione horribly.*

He even told Hermione that Viktor's interest in her was only to get information about the Triwizard Tournament. That's just incredibly mean. After the ball, he continued to act out toward Hermione although it was his fault all along that she went to the ball with Viktor.

** Hermione Rarely Laughs At Ron's Jokes
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: hermione-rarely-laughs-at-rons-jokes
   :END:
Ron's role in the movies, even more so than in the books, is decidedly comedic relief. Fans love him for his wry jokes and funny reactions that we find relatable.

Does Hermione enjoy Ron's jokes? Not so much. She seems to respond to his jokes more with eye-rolls and disapproval than laughter and sincere enjoyment.

*Doesn't everyone want to be with a romantic partner who genuinely makes them laugh?*

Of course, being funny isn't everything in a romantic relationship, especially one that's been through as much as Ron and Hermione's, but a shared sense of humor is often an indication of compatibility.

** J.K. Rowling Says She Regrets The Couple
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: j.k.-rowling-says-she-regrets-the-couple
   :END:
J.K. Rowling wrote the characters of Harry, Ron and Hermione, so if she comes out and says that she doesn't think that Ron and Hermione make sense.

That's precisely what Rowling said in an interview with [[https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/jk-admits-harry-should-have-wed-hermione-j39vv800cnw][/The Times/]]: "I wrote the Hermione/Ron relationship as a form of wish fulfillment. That's how it was conceived, really. For reasons that have very little to do with literature and far more to do with me clinging to the plot as I first imagined it, Hermione ended up with Ron."

** They're Awful At Communicating With Each Other
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: theyre-awful-at-communicating-with-each-other
   :END:
Another problem that Ron and Hermione have is that they don't communicate well with each other. Sure, many couples have those kinds of communication problems, but they were friends before they ever dated, so they should have learned to work out these issues already.

/The Goblet of Fire/'s Yule Ball is an excellent example. Ron wanted to ask her, but he didn't, at least not until it was too late and Hermione already had a date. Likewise, in /The Half-Blood Prince/, Hermione waited until Ron was feeling angry and left out to ask him to accompany her to the Slug Club party.

** They Have Different Ambitions In Life
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: they-have-different-ambitions-in-life
   :END:
Hermione is very ambitious and has a very good idea of what she wants to do with her life. This is a personality trait that she carries through all of the /Harry Potter/ franchise.

*Hermione has become the Minister of Magic.*

Meanwhile Ron hasn't done much of anything with his life - reflective of his unclear ambitions when he was at Hogwarts. His job is managing his brothers' joke shop.

Sure, opposites attract, but it would have been nice if Hermione's ambition had inspired Ron.

** In Deathly Hallows, Hermione Chose Harry Over Ron
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: in-deathly-hallows-hermione-chose-harry-over-ron
   :END:
This moment in The Deathly Hallows fueled a lot of fans who wanted Hermione and Harry to get together instead. When it came down to it, Hermione chose to go with Harry to help him find the Horcruxes, even after Ron was overwhelmed by the evil power of the locket.

Firstly, Hermione chose Harry over Ron, showing where her loyalties were. Second, Ron saw that Hermione chose Harry over her, which should have been a sign that she had a solid preference in who she spent her time with. None of that mattered, though, and in the end, the two became a couple.

But my other question is just... And? Which canon? Original book canon, Edited book canon, film canon, tweet canon, interview canon, etc? Canon in this fandom is itself a contradictory mess, even in determining what's canon and what isn't. If everything Rowling says is canon is actually canon, then McGonagall both is and isn't headmistress.

There's a reason Death of the Author is a thing. :)

****** I don't give a flying fuck what Rowling has to say on literally any topic, and that includes which of her books/plays/movies are canon. You're welcome to include whatever you want into what you consider canon, but I'll do the same. Don't act like Rowlings words are gospel because they just aren't. There's thousands of sects on Christianity, and the most popular one (catholicism) includes tons of stuff that isn't part of many other denominations.

The prevailing view among HP fans is that Cursed Child isn't canon. Don't act like you have the moral high-ground because you want to follow what Rowling says like gospel. No thanks.

** I tried to seriously answer you post, but it's just full of nitpicking, Ron bashing and Hermione pampering. But as a member of the League of Defense for Ron, I will just answer some points:

- Cursed Child is a terrible fanfic that somehow got recognition. It is not Canon and will never be. Anything inside is shit, from Harry the terrible father to Cedric the Death Eater. Snapish Hermione and Stupid Ron and just some problems among many.
- Bickering is not fighting. Parents shabbling during breakfast will clearly not affect a child the same way parent fighting over breakfast would.
- Noting that a girl is beautifull is different from eying her. And eying a girl does not make someone a terrible husband ready to throw his wife away. If it was the case, going to a fashion show would be a ground for divorce.
- Ron is also closer to Harry, should I start to support the Harrald ship?
- On the same note, Harry prefer Ron to Hermione. In GoF, he notes that being friend with Hermione can be very boring.
- Once they became friend, Ron never cared about Hermione bookworm tendencies unless it directly afected him (being draged to the library 10 weeks before the exams as an example).
- Ron did grow up during the serie, just like Hermione. He learnt to be serious when he had to while she learnt to relax when she could. Differents characters grow up differently.
- Both the Yule Ball and Canary incidents are teens being unable to controle their hormones and their emotions. It would be unacceptable for adults to do something like that, but it's different when they are 15.
- Ron never felt resented Hermione because "she was smart". In the books (since the movies did Ron dirty), Hermione is book smart while Ron is street smart. Ron would never have been able to identify the basilisk from some books, Hermione would never have been able to escape Snatchers alone.
- Ron did do something with is life. He became an Auror (one of the most respected job in the Magical World) before deciding he had fought enough Dark Wizard and helping his brother managing a very succesfull shop. Adult Ron has more than enough money, his happy with his job and got the girl he loved, he is definitively a sucessfull man.
- Hermione did not "/choose Harry over Ron/". She chose her mission (killing Voldemort) over a quasi Horcruxe controled Ron. Also, Harry seducing Hermione after this scene when Hermione is completely heartbroken would have been almost predatory (get them when they are weak).
- No matter how much I may respect the actor, I could not care less about what Ruper Grint think about Ron and Hermione relation. As for Rowling, she had 7 books to write her opinion, and she still chose to make them finish together so too late for regrets.

  They don't bicker in book 1, book 3, book 4 and book 6 they full on fight

  No because Harry is not gay, and I stated Hermione is closer to Harry not Harry to Hermione

  On the same note, Harry prefer Ron to Hermione. In GoF, he notes that being friend with Hermione can be very boring.

  He didn't say he's boring just less fun than him.

  Once they became friend, Ron never cared about Hermione bookworm tendencies unless it directly afected him (being draged to the library 10 weeks before the exams as an example).

  Sometimes he didn't care but he still could be mean to her for that.

  Eh no Hermione physically abused Ron and Ron abused Hermione emontionaly many times in a series.

  Ron never felt resented Hermione because "she was smart". In the books (since the movies did Ron dirty), Hermione is book smart while Ron is street smart. Ron would never have been able to identify the basilisk from some books, Hermione would never have been able to escape Snatchers alone.

  I wouldn't call Ron smart just better than average.

  Ron did do something with is life. He became an Auror (one of the most respected job in the Magical World) before deciding he had fought enough Dark Wizard and helping his brother managing a very succesfull shop. Adult Ron has more than enough money, his happy with his job and got the girl he loved, he is definitively a sucessfull man.

  Yes he is for you but we don't know if he din't wanted something more.

  Hermione did not "choose Harry over Ron". She chose her mission (killing Voldemort) over a quasi Horcruxe controled Ron. Also, Harry seducing Hermione after this scene when Hermione is completely heartbroken would have been almost predatory (get them when they are weak).

  It's still chosing Harry side, she didn't know if Ron will be safe.

Everyone on this sub is a fan who has read the book, yet most people stilll disagree with each other. As for his role, Rupert Grint played movie Ron, which is a completely different character from Book Ron (since, once again, they did Ron dirty).

As for Rowling, she "wrote" that character in her book, where he ends up happily married to the girl. I don't care that she changed her opinion with time, in canon, he got the girl.

Did Rowling write CC? No, then it's not canon, simple as that. I'll admit that, since Rowling said that she considered this thing canon, it is up for debate, but since :

- CC is unable to be consistent with the books (Canon say that you can't change the past, yet the whole plot of CC is based on 2 kids changing the past)
- Destroy pretty much all the characters from canon
- Inserted a "My Immortal" level character (Incredibily hot silver haired girl with blue ends who managed to fight 4 trained adult wizards to a stand still including the Head Auror)

Then, I'll refuse to recognize this as canon, since it's way easier to ignore a bad fanfic rather than modify the 7 canon books to somehow having this thing fit into "canon".

And I can happily imagine Ron and Hermione happily bickering one with another for their whole life (perhaps they could use some marriage counselling, but that isn't the end of the world).

#+end_quote

Sorry I mean Harry was closer to her in movies but in the books to Ron. He didn't speak with her beacause of the drama about the broom, why wouldn't he speak with Ron in a third year? I don't agree with 6th year he was good friend for her in that year not only for Ron. They didn't speak because their best friend left them and didn't know what he's doing is he safe.

** I agree. Ron deserved better than a racist (centaurs) egocentric (the way she treats her peers) person who could never admit her faults (broomstick, scabbers, HBP). Of course, Hermione is overall a good person when you add things like nuance and context into situations, but if you don't do it for Ron, you can't do it for Hermione.

Hermione and Harry would never have worked. Harry didn't enjoy the same things she did and the two were less compatible than Hedwig and Crookshanks. She doesn't trust Harry at all. Malfoy the death eater, the potions book, firebolt, their respective dates in 4th year, time turner. She's not even a person Harry would like if it wasn't for the troll incident and their adventures afterwards. This is unlike Ron and Harry would got along like fire. The first time Hermione met Harry and Ron, she insulted both of them.

Why wouldn't Harry like Hermione? The way she treats Luna. The way she treats Firenze. The way she treats her peers. Her lack of empathy, worse than Ron. Ron doesn't realize that Harry and Cho want to talk in private. Hermione fucking laughs at Lavender and Ron's dead pets. And she stills calls people out for being oblivious to the emotions of others. It's even worse if Hermione isn't oblivious and just disregards the feelings of others. People call Ron out for being insecure. Hermione's worse, it's just more subtle. Look at her need for constant affirmations from teachers, her inability to acknowledge her academic success, and the way she puts down her peers to feel better about herself even though another one of her insecurities is her lack of friends. She charms her parent's memories.

She doesn't care about Harry or Ron's opinions and is incredibly hypocritical. Look at how she treats Ron, Harry, and Sirius.

Hell the quote that sums up Hermione is this:

#+begin_quote
  I'll bet you wish you hadn't given up Divination now, don't you, Hermione?” asked Parvati, smirking.

  It was breakfast time a few days after the sacking of Professor Trelawney, and Parvati was curling her eyelashes around her wand and examining the effect in the back of her spoon. They were to have their first lesson with Firenze that morning.

  “Not really,” said Hermione indifferently, who was reading the Daily Prophet. “I've never really liked horses.”

  She turned a page of the newspaper, scanning its columns.

  “He's not a horse, he's a centaur!” said Lavender, sounding shocked

  “A gorgeous centaur . . .” sighed Parvati.

  “Either way, he's still got four legs,” said Hermione coolly.

** She had little respect for Harry that she and Ron whispered behind his back. She showed lack of trust in him when she disregarded his intuition that Draco was a death eater and that he preferred to deal with his grief of losing Sirius in silence (instead badgering him to open up and talk about it). Hence, Harry didn't want to tell her some of his struggles, or when he had a vision; he couldn't rely on her to not fuss about it.

Not sure who's less mature; the boy who messes up while under the influence of a dark mind-controlling artefact, but returns and apologises, or the girl who attacked her best friend because she was jealous and couldn't handle her emotions seeing him with someone else. This says more about her as a person than who she's attracted to. Who knows, she might have done something similar to Harry, if they were in a relationship (that you seem to assume is a good fit).

I don't disagree that Ron and Hermione are unsuitable as a couple, but I can't agree that Harry and Hermione is any better. During the argument between Harry and Ron (book 4), we get to know that Harry misses Ron, and being with Hermione wasn't the same. He seems to prefer Ron's company.

*** People just never understand nuance. Ron's two biggest flaws had good reasons behind them. In one incident, Ron was injured and under the influence of a Horcrux. In the other, Harry had just spent 30 minutes at party in his honor and had come up with a gryffindor banner around his neck. And Ron still tried to be polite.

I'd like to see people find an excuse for this:

You love Harmony so much? Go join [[/r/Harmony][r/Harmony]] and the Harmony Discord. You'll find like-minded individuals you can sip the "Harmony/Hermione is the best" Kool-Aid with and jerk each other off to pics of Emma Watson. Plus, you'll be able to whine about how "no one understands our ship" even though you guys make up one of the biggest pairings after the canon ones.
