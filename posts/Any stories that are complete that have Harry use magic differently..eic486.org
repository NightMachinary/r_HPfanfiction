It could be something as simple as wandless magic to something as complex as making it Chakra(Naruto) in all, but name. He could be able to conjure permanent edible food, or be an animal shifter(turning into any animal known). He could even fashion himself as a certain 5th dimensional Imp. The sky's the limit.

All I ask is that it's complete, even if it's part of a series, then the series must be complete. Got into this awesome new AU, got 15 chapters in of 21, it'd already reached GOF, but then looked, and saw that the sequel has only 15ish thousand words, and hadn't been updated in years. Not trying to shame the author, I understand life get's in the way. I just want a nice full complete story with unique magic, and Harry being awesome.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

** linkffn(12026631), I liked the premise, but has a little too much of tell instead of show

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Powerful!Harry, Super!Harry, magical theory, Harry/Luna. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun. Complete.

Knowledge is useful but power is power.

It gives an insight into the seemingly absurd and dangerous things that happen so frequently in the wizarding world.

It also touches on a canon idea during Moody's class that I don't think I've ever seen in fanfiction. That the killing curse is not a one-hit kill unless you have the power to fuel it. "All of you could point your wands at me and cast it and I doubt I'd get so much as a nosebleed."
