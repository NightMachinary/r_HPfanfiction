Alright folks. After having to remove and lock an old thread where people were trying to share copies of HP and the Boy Who Lived I'm kind of fed up. This subreddit is not a place for you to try to get around DLP's rules. I don't care if you're too lazy to make a few posts there in order to get access. The next time I see it I'm going to start handing out bans.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

If they make it known.

The DLP situation is a little different than random fic X posted publicly on site Y. DLP's WbA section is not intended as a public fanfic publishing area. It's specifically intended as a place for authors to gather feedback, and DLP has made it clear that they're not okay with people taking content from there and distributing it elsewhere.

******* The thing is though, sometimes FFN will go through and delete things that are in violation, when that author is no longer active (thus isn't going to post it elsewhere, or might not even know it was removed), or in some cases authors have actually died and /can't/ repost.

I don't like fiction hunt because it does it without consent, but because of how fucky FFN can be sometimes, I'm a little more sympathetic about it.

Wording the rule to state that distributing stories against the will of their authors would be better.

Actively distributing material via this subreddit is quite a bit different from informing someone about the existence of a site where they might obtain something that a third site doesn't want that second site to have because having it violates the third site's rules which no one here has anything to do with.

The problem with FFN is the very selective enforcement of their rules. It can be hard to tell if you're in violation, and even if you are.. you may or may not at some undetermined future time have your story taken down without warning. And they certainly won't respond to inquiries.

**** It's because of the fact that someone has been plagiarizing a shit ton of stories found in the DLP Work By Author section recently. It makes it hard to stop that, I imagine, if copies of the work are being circulated outside of the site. And furthermore, if an author hasn't moved a chapter from the Work by Author section to ff.net or similar sites, it means he/she feels it isn't ready yet and still wants to work on it before publishing. One would be a dick to go against them like that.

Just saying.

A few authors have stopped sharing their pre-published works publicly---which they are well within their right to do---due to the threat of having it stolen.

I like this version a lot better.

I'm not sure why, but the original version of the rule annoyed me and I elected to go have lunch and see if it still annoyed me when I wasn't hungry.

Came back and saw this instead and thought: "That seems perfectly reasonable."

***** It is not really a good rule, given that we do not know what other communities have as rules. "Don't post slash" for example could be a rule, and technically, posting a slash story on reddit would be "circumventing that rule". It's rather clear that this is not intended, but the wording makes that a valid conclusion.

That's why I think we shouldn't refer to any other TOS, but name the specific action - distributing works an author doesn't want distributed.
