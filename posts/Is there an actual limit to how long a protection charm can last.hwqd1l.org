I had a long winded argument with another community member about how long a protection charm could last. I asked for an actual citation that proves it can't possibly last 10 years or more. Was never given one. We have fidelis if the secret is never given out. Could possibly last eons if for some reason the secret keeper is immortal. Then there's the imperius curse, which we had Barty Crouch Jr under for at least a decade. Even yet the curse on the DADA position which was there for decades.

Their answer to that was basically you can't compare the longevity of charms with curses/jinxes. Still didn't give me an actual source on that.

Then they go about how if such a thing exists Dumbledore and Co would of used it. As if he's the be all end all of magical knowledge. When we have the Flamel's who made a rock that grants eternal life. Just because it was never ever used in canon doesn't meant it could not possibly exist in the greater universe.

So [[/r/HPfanfiction]] I implore you to give me a citation from canon that actually proves me wrong.


** Quintapeds are familial transfiguration/bloodline curse that has lasted for centuries. You're right.

** We know that Charms do eventually wear off - see the Hogwarts school brooms, on which the Charms are failing because they're so old. We also know that the Cheering Charm wears off after a few hours.

We are also aware of Charms which never wear off such as Gubraithian Fire.

I would suggest:

- Some Charms deteriorate over time; other Charms, by their nature, are permanent (so long as you have cast them successfully).

- Of the Charms that deteriorate over time, the natural duration of the Charm varies from Charm to Charm. Some have a much longer natural duration than others (e.g. Flying Charm lasts a lot longer than Cheering Charm).

- Of the Charms that deteriorate over time, the length of time which the Charm lasts is also determined by the power of the spell (overpowered Cheering Charms took longer to wear off).

Going by the example of the school brooms, for at least certain Charms, a few decades seems to be a reasonable time frame for a Charm to last where it has been cast by a professional who specialises in that spell.

** We have no canon evidence as far as I know. Some could last until another spell takes them down I reckon. Others may have certain conditions for them to end sooner, like a time limit (or in fidelius case, the secret guardian dying). I guess if you don't want to go AU you can use whatever you like that you need in your fic as long as it doesn't contradict standing examples. (Like, there's no mention of wards having to be reinforced daily while in the Horcrux hunt)

*** AU or not doesn't matter to me. But the person I was arguing with was keen on a limit existing from canon. So if I ever get something from it that says otherwise I'll gladly back down from my standpoint.

*** In the case of the Fidelius, the death of the Secret Keeper does not end the charm, but make everyone knowing the secret a Secret Keeper.

With some organization (like only sharing the secret to 1 or 2 person by generation), it is not unthinkable to have a place protected for decades, if not centuries.

** Given that Voldemort can't enter Privet Drive after 13 yrs and the protections of the cave were still on after 16/17 it's safe to say they go beyond 10 years.

*** Didn't harry have to spend some time there every year to recharge the blood protections? If so, wouldn't that means they would have failed if he never came home for a summer.

**** The "recharge" idea is fanon. In canon, the Charm continues to work so long as he calls Privet Drive home. Spending a few weeks there a year seems to be the minimum amount of time he can stay there and still satisfy the requirement that it is his home.

**** Yeah, and I completely get your point, but the Imperius Curse on BCJ was dependent on the breath in his father's body. A number of the protective spells depend on something but they /can/ exceed 10 years

**** That was actually more a case of it not counting as his home if he doesn't stay there and the protection relies on him being able to call a place with his mother's blood home.

**** That's my headcanon too but the books never state specifically what the protection offered by Privet Drive means. Voldemort was already immune to Harry's blood protection by HBP, but Dumbledore still asks the Dursleys to allow him to come back for one more month.

***** The books do explain it in PS and OotP.

Harry has two different protections:

1. The power of Lily's sacrifice, which remains in Harry's blood, and which makes Voldemort incapable of touching/harming Harry.

2. The "Bond of Blood" Charm cast by Dumbledore on Harry, which draws upon the power of Lily's sacrifice, and which protects him from harm at the location where his mother's blood dwells, so long as he continues to call that place home.

Voldemort taking Harry's blood in GoF neutralised the former (while also tying Harry to life), but did nothing to affect the latter.

** Orion's protections on Grimauld Place resist in 1995 even after his death (1979). The only additional protection added by Dumbledore is the Fidelius Charm according to OotP. Which is quite inconsistent, as in why would some charms last after the death of the caster, while others wouldn't.
