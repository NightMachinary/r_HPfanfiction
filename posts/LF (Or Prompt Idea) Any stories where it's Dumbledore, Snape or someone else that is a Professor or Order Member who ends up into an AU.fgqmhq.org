Not looking for crossover, just looking for another universe. So many of them are about Harry, Ron, Hermione and/or Ginny or such character; so I just would like to see Dumbledore, Snape, McGonagall, Lupin, or someone else who is either a Professor or Order Member.

Can be on any site, anyone can be the main character, am fine with het/slash/femslash

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.

Not looking for Harem or Lord Harry Potter. Not wanting super overpowered or super smart Harry. Harry slightly powerful, or slightly smarter is fine, but I'd rather it be more believable, if possible.

Would rather not have character bashing. Characters disliking or hating each other is fine, but an author going out of their way to bash a character is normally a no go. If it's a minor part of the story, I suppose it's okay, but would rather not have character bashing, if possible.


** In 'The Bureaucratic Error' Remus goes back in time and basically creates an AU. It is regularly updated. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052940/1/The-Bureaucratic-Error]]
