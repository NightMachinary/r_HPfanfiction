Hello, I just want to have this because, after I read a post regarding Harry learning Ancient Egyptian / bonding with the Gods/Goddesses of Egypt, I am wondering what would be the best way to write the magic itself. I.E Incantations and all of that good stuff.

Considering that Anceint Egypt was a powerhouse when it came to an empire, would it be too farfetched in where Ancient Egyptian magic is more powerful and more refined and or violent compared to the magic the people of Wizarding Britain learn, and would it need a catalyst to cast such things?

I'm just wondering, it had sparked an interest and it seems like an interesting idea to try and start writing a few chapters to.


** I think with any magic it's important to look at what was important and practical to the people in question at any time, so with Egyptians I'm not in any way an expert, but the Nile seemed to be pretty central to the way they organised their calendar and stuff, so maybe some of it was intent based and elemental. Making sure the Nile flooded at the right time, and grain wasn't eaten by pests or rot, carving out tombs and working outThe Pharaohs were considered to be gods so is it more heavy hitting elemental magic? Weather magic? Death magic?

But we also know that soul magic was if not invented in Egypt, at least it was used and refined there to make horcruxes

Plus their curses and protections were gnarly enough that curse breakers were still being employed to work on breaking them

*** They were also big into medicine - on a tour of Egypt about a decade ago, I remember seeing carvings depicting male genitalia exhibiting a venereal disease in a complex largely dedicated to a Greek healer who was associated with the Egyptian pantheon (I've forgotten the details).

Also, in the British Museum, there are many exhibits that can be touched, or at least, could be touched the last time I was there (late 1970s). Perhaps Harry, on a field trip, could get a jolt from touching the Rosetta Stone or, more likely, some less famous and more relevant artifact.

** I'm with Karigan on this one. Magic reflects the people, so you've gotta look at what's important to them. Egypt was an immensely practical nation and one of the few to survive most of the Bronze Age Collapse. Egyptian Beliefs focused a lot on patterns and cycles - rising and lowering of floodwaters in the Nile, seasonal change, death and resurrection, etc. It's all about maintaining the order of the Universe and the cyclical patterns it falls into.

Egyptian Magic was also very focused on that same sense of practicality and function. You'd call in a Wizard like you'd call in an Exterminator or a Plumber and that was perfectly normal to them. Priests tended to specifically focus on doing the big maintenance rituals, but there was a different type of wizard you could call in to help with all manner of things from fertility to healing to pest control.

Spells and Charms did exist, with both incantations and motions, but the spell could be attached to a myriad of foci (not just the wand - though they did have those, they were usually used as drawing tools for protective circles or symbols of authority for summoning beings) and was often more complex and ritualistic than the swish and speak method of Harry Potter. You might activate an Amulet (worn gewgaws like necklaces that give special powers or protection), or a figurine, or a potion, or the wand, but there'd be a process of preparation and routine to go through beforehand, and the spell could be anything from a spell written on a scroll, a ritual dance, or just drawing symbols and images of powerful beings on various surfaces to draw their attention (and thus protection).

So, yeah. If you're gonna make an Egyptian-ish magic system that reflects what they thought, make it practically-focused and make it ritualistic.

**** Quite possible, sure. Someone had to make the Organ Pots for burials, after all. :)

Plus, the God of the Nile and Childbirth was called Khnum the Divine Potter. He literally made children like pots before depositing them in wombs to be born, like the Egyptian version of the Stork myth. So, y'know. There's a cool Priesthood potential there. :)

** I would recommend two ways.

One: Rick Riordan has a Egyptian magic system that you could look at for inspiration

Two: People in Africa use wandless magic according to pottermore so just do that because the wand Is a European invention

**** Go onto pottermore and look at the African wizarding school. They are adept in transfiguration and I remember shapeshifting being a big part of Egyptian mythology. You could also have harry use parsletounge (how do u spell this?) Cuz snakes are Important animals in all myths.
