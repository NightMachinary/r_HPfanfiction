I've read some discussions lately about how Snape's treatment of Harry would be different if he were born a Rose/Harriet/etc, especially if she resembles her mother. I saw speculation that Snape could easily become unhealthily obsessed with an underage Lily Jr.

I think it would be fascinating to read a fic where Snape is almost "creepy" towards a redheaded fem!Harry, in a stalkerish sort of way.

I'm not particularly interested in any fem!Harry/Severus Snape pairings, but if it fits my request, go ahead and recommend it.


** There was an unfinished fic from ages ago with a female Hufflepuff Harry and Snape acts alternately mean/caring/creepy towards her to the point that Dumbledore gets freaked out about his behavior (he pulls him aside and Harry can hear him tell Severus that he needs to realize she isn't Lily).

If you post an ask question in one of the forums on fanfic.net, someone might have it. Sorry I can't remember the name. And yes, i totally think if Harry was a girl, especially if she had red hair and green eyes, that Snape would be creepy in a LIttlefinger/Sansa sort of way.

*** That sounds exactly like what I was looking for! Thank you so much for your help!

I was trying to word it in a way that didn't sound like I was looking for non-con or smut, because I'm not. I'm glad you understood what I was going for.

** linkao3(His Mother's Eyes by Lillielle) doesn't quite meet your request since Harry's a boy in it, but Snape views him as Lily Jr all the same. Dark, non-con, no happy ending.

***** Oh my God. I literally read this this morning on fanfiction.net by coincidence. Imagine that!

It's got about the level of darkness I was looking for, but it accelerated rather quickly. I wonder if there are any longer fics with a slower pace heading towards but not necessarily containing non-con.

** I wonder if these authors actually want to make Snape likable, because it fails dismally. If he was so petty and ridiculous that making Harry female would change his disposition entirely, it just makes him a much worse person.

*** I was talking about fics where Snape would be creeping on a female Harry that looked like Lily rather than James.

Not in a good-natured, mentor way, but in a scary, obsessive way. The one-shot linked in the thread entitled "Sinful" is exactly what I was referring to, so check that one out if you want to see what I was thinking of.

The staff does know about his obsession with Lily though and warn Harry that if he is acting creepy to report him (though he mentions he would never do anything inappropriate)
