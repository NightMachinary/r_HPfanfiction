Looking for stories where Harry has mental illness(es). I don't care what caused them or what they are.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is disappointed by the Wizarding World. A society wielding powers beyond imagination and it is wasted on Politics and Games. A psychotic Harry Potter aims to remind the world what it means to be a Wizard and to judge who is Worthy of Magic and who isn't.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.

*** Your description of why Harry is mentally ill in The Art of Self-Fashioning is off. I don't remember him identifying as an animal, though he does transfigure some animal traits permanently on his body because he needed the practice.

The reason he's mentally fucked up is because not only was he unloved and emotionally abused for his entire life, but he also finds out his parents were tortured into insanity, and decides to devote every aspect of his life to curing him. Making that your one goal in life wouldn't be mentally healthy.

** Ugh I just read a really good one-shot called something like "The Chamaeleon" where it shows Harry in 3rd year as a metamorphmagus with a time turner, slowly growing distinct personalities. The problem is that it is in the middle of a collection, and I'm terrible at remembering those :( if someone else knows how to find it please drop a link!

** What kind of mental illness do you mean? As in acquired mental illness, or disability from injury, or just being neuro-atypical, or...?

I /know/ there's one story I'm thinking of where the horcrux in Harry's head keeps trying to possess him and it makes him look crazy to everyone else...what was it...? Ah, right, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9040382/1/Psychosis][Psychosis I believe.]]

**** Something that sticks out to me right away is that schizophrenia is a serious mental illness in the Muggle world. Schizophrenia can come in the forms of hallucinations or delusions, whether bizarre or non-bizarre. But basically belief in magic, seeing magic tricks, etc, is just indoctrination into the wizarding world.

#+begin_quote
  It seems that Harry has Dissociative Identity Disorder (Multiple Personality Disorder). To him, this is nothing new. He's known of his alters for as long as he can remember. Magic, however, is a different story entirely. When he finds himself sorted into Slytherin, he learns that the choices he must make are more important than he ever imagined. ((Currently in Book 3))

  AU The Dursleys taught Harry to fear and hate magic and all things magical including himself. Now how long will it take the wizarding world see the damage done? And can they ever hope to fix it? Disturbing. WIP

  What happens when a brain damaged Harry and a transgender Hermione both get sorted into Slytherin? Snape's not sure, but he thinks it's likely to be an interesting term. This story follows various first years through the trials of their first year.

** In [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/852061][Kiss the Joy until the Sun Rise]] Harry has fairly severe PTSD and also is unsure what's real. (You need to be signed into AO3 to read it)

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/391011][Together]] is a really smutty trio one-shot where Harry has some serious mental illness or maybe brain damage.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/13439][In Between Days]] has a seriously depressed Harry who also develops a sorta Stockholm syndrome. Pretty crazy fic for mental illness.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/304714][Crystalis]] has a pretty depressed Harry with PTSD.
