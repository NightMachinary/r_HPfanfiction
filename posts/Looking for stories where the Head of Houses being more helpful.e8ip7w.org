Looking for stories with the Head Houses being more helpful for the students. It always annoyed me whenever Harry and co asked McGonagall for help, she didn't do anything.

I'm not just looking for Snape and McGonagall to be more helpful, but the other two Head of Houses as well Filius Flitwick and Pomona Sprout.

It doesn't have to be anything major, just something with the head of houses.

No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Would rather not have Weasley or Dumbledore Bashing if possible

Would rather it be completed if possible

  In the middle of their second year, Draco and Harry discover they're soulmates and do their best to keep it a secret from everyone. Their best isn't perfect. ~“Are you trying to get killed, Potter?” Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.” Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, “Potter, what the hell--”~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)

  Wasted potential is far more offensive to a teacher than outright mediocrity, and it is for that reason, chiefly, that she considers him to be one of the great disappointments of her career. If, then, she should keep seeing potential where everyone else has given up, and if they are to be forever discussing what he will make of himself, so be it.Minerva wonders if he is as aware of the patterns as she is.Six conversations between Minerva McGonagall and Sirius Black, 1976-1996.

  Minerva McGonagall can see a lot of herself in Hermione Granger, and so, when she catches her skipping a Charms class, she decides not to punish her. That decision is the beginning of a friendship that will carry them through triumph and disaster, as Hermione grows up in one of the most turbulent times the Wizarding World has ever known.

*** she wrote a fairy tale for children not a serious story

in canon she basically makes it so that if you do anything beyond defending yourself you are evil, you cant seek more power because thats the path to the dark you will survive through luck and by throwing bodies in front of the madman over and over again until he makes a mistake and everybody deserves a second chance even the pieces of shit that tortured and killed people and broke how many fucking laws because they felt sorry and dont even get me started on the damn epilogue like seriously harry cut the head of the damn hydra but what about the rest of the problems that lead to voldemort blood purity is still an issue the damn statue of secrecy is probably going to need to be fixed than there are the death eaters that aren't marked, there are so many issues with it that i cant stand it

the whole message of the epilogue was that all is well but all it seemed like was that it glossed over soooo many issues that i almost ripped the book apart

edit

i know i sort of went of a tangent sorry about that but this needed to be said

if you share my opinion then i suggest you read linkffn(Novocaine) and linkffn(Blame it on me) (this is more focused a lot on romance but shows some of the issues i mentioned) because it provides a much more satisfying post war scene but i haven't been able to find any fics that make canon make sense without either making the teachers incompetent or having dumbledore being a manipulative bastard who is trying to isolate harry

**** I kind of agree with this point. People on this sub seem to abhor bashing fics but Dumbledore is indeed a manipulative bastard (your throwing bodies at V comment is spot on).

I also rage inside on "Molly is the mother of the year" in canon when she never really properly cared for Harry as an adult should (re: proper clothes, living situation, etc).

I tend to pretend the epilogue didn't happen, lol

I got that you don't like Snape. I appreciate his story and feel that out of the whole Order he was the one actually doing something useful (shit personality aside). He brought info and saved whom he could while others seem to be twiddling their thumbs.

***** lots of people dont agree with my opinion of snape but its just that to me he is the man who became a death eater killed and tortured who knows how many people and willingly gave the prophecy to V knowing he would most likely kill the CHILD then only turned around to dumbledore when he realised who it was that was the mother of the child and then spent years verbally abusing said child and making his life uncomfortable

yes he was useful as a spy and probably the most useful member of the order but other the only redeeming feature of snape for me is that he was played by alain rickman

****** eh, Alan Rickman did nothing for me to tell the truth. I imagined Snape totally differently (uglier and a couple of decades younger). The whole of Harry's parents generation was too freaking old in films.

But I digress, he was, in fact, a POS human who tried to do better. The only one who did. The rest rugswept and pretended that they weren't wrong at all thus causing the second war. I can't be too hard on Snape who at least realized that killing people isn't nice and paid with his life for it. There was no way for him to live IMO
