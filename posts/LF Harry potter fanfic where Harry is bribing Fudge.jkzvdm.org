Hi. First time posting here.

Need help in looking for a fanfic where harry is bribing fudge.

I remember that in one chapter, Harry was able to convince Fudge regarding a bill in the wizengamot.

Lucius was not happy with the results and tells Fudge that he wont be getting his "campaign" funds, but Fudge was okay with that since he is getting bribed by Harry.

Also in another chapter, when Umbridge was High Inquisitor, she was trying to get Fudge to see Harry in a bad light but fails due to the bribes.

Thanks in advance.
