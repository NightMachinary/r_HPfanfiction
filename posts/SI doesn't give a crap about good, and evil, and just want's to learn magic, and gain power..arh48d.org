Any of these stories around. I ask, because if I was popped into HP say a year before canon, and I have knowledge that even though it's going to get rough, they win in the end, and i'm say eleven(basically every SI story), i'd just stay out of everyone's way, learn magic, test theories, and when whe TWT starts book it to America until everything is settled, or if i'm powerful enough at the time, ignore everything unless they come across me(DE, or dark wizards/creatures in general), and probably troll people for the hell of it. Any such stories out there.

TL;DR SI doesn't give a crap, and doesn't try to get involved in the plot while learning, and/or experimenting with magic.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** This is my fave SI. He /tries/ to not get involved (and only wants his own island! And library! And research!) But well... Read and find out.

*** Is that SV only? Are there any other SV only fics you'd care to recommend? I've looked through most of what Spacebattles has but didn't think to check the other.

** Uh. This half qualifies. SI doesn't care about good. Still plenty evil.

It's kind of weird, but at least it's innovative. Lots of experimentation happens (though it's all ad hoc in service of the plot, not the consequence of good world building). If you don't enjoy the first couple chapters, then it's probably not for you.

*** Yeah, I stopped reading this after the first few chapters. I do nit enjoy the way this story portrays magic. Thanks for the recommendation though.

** The moral immoral. If you find the cure to cancer, it is more immoral to force you spread it than it is to not spread it. Where Harry may have the power to kill Voldemort, but he is not required to do so. I would like a story like this just because of the moral questions it would create.
