I'm always looking for good remus lupin fanfiction, anyone know any good fanfics to keep my addiction up?


** Aye! I could do with one as well. :) I've been reading one on hpff, it's not particularly well written, but the ideas are quite interesting. It starts off with Harry giving Teddy his father's set of diaries, starting with his life at Hogwarts. It's a WIP, so currently it's up to about the 6th's book (Dumbledore dying and Snape's 'betrayal')...one thing though, not to purposely ruin it, but in this fic, Remus has a crush on Lily (I noticed you said you don't want any Remus/Lily or Remus/Sirius ships)...Anyways, if you could deal with the crush, I think the author stays relatively close to the books, and you're interested in reading the fic, I'll link you. :)

** Oh, ragefrox. You've come to the right place. Except I'd like to know first, before I mortally offend yet another redditor with the wrong 'ship or slash, what you mean by "good."

** Only skimmed these, but these are by authors I like.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=290578][Run from the Darkness]] which is AU but based in canon details.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=231352][Never Shall We Die]] short story collection about the Marauders.

** This is a cool one, though different from the usual fare: [[http://wolfsbane.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=2066][20 Random Facts About Remus Lupin]]. In fact, the whole Wolfsbane archive is a good place to find Lupin-centric fanfiction.

** I'm a huge Lupin fan too, and I've read a ton of fics based on him. My list isn't any where near complete, but I've posted some of my favorites that I think are worth recommending on [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/nknx2/a_collection_of_fics_for_remus_lupin_fans/][this post]]. You're sure to find at least a few you'll really enjoy.

But I'm always looking for more too, so would you care to list a few of your favorites for us? Maybe you know of some good ones we haven't come across yet.

** It's probably inappropriate to recommend M-rated fics here, where there are bound to be lots of under-18 readers. Unfortunately, this cuts my list of possible recommendations considerably. :-)

But here's a T-rated Lupin fic a few of us on this subreddit really liked: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2984737/1/Midnight_in_the_Owlery][Midnight at the Owlery]]. (Warning: implied slash.)
