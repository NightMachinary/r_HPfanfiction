I'm a bit of a fan of harry/fleur, but struggle to find many fics of the pairing that aren't massively ooc/an excuse for masses of smut.

I really like Fleur as a character, so her paired with other characters would still be interesting, so long as she is a main/major character.

I'd also be particularly interested in anything that starts out with harry & Fleur disliking each other.


** Uhh, let's see.

There's much more, but I can't remember them and I can't find any in my Favorites :(

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5142565/1/Knowledge-is-Power][Knowledge is Power.]] I've only read a bit, but it seems to be a good fic. It's H/F, not sure how big of a role it plays yet. Going to read it tonight and just remove this bit of my comment tomorrow if it wasn't any good :P

**** Nope! But if you /do/ want more Harry/Fleur, here are some more absolutely phenomenal fics, in addition to SniperGW's mentions:

 

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5150093/1/The-Skitterleap][*The Skitterleap*]] - /Fifty years ago, Grindelwald won the duel that shaped the world. In a land overwhelmed by darkness, a hero emerges: a young wizard with the power, influence and opportunity to restore the light. Harry Potter, caught up in a deadly game of cat and mouse, must decide what he truly believes. Does this world deserve redemption? Or, more importantly, does he?/

Notes: One of the most AU, and most interesting fics I've read. Don't miss it!

 

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6896279/1/We-ll-All-Fall-After-The-Yule-Ball][*We'll All Fall After The Yule Ball*]] - /Harry's attraction to Parvati leads him to take his Yule Ball preparation much more seriously and his night is changed as a result. Includes an awesome Ron, an interesting Parvati and a drunk Katie Bell. Oh, and what's a Yule Ball fic without a little Fleur Delacour?/

Notes: It's not everyone's cup of tea, but don't underestimate this story because of the description. I, personally, loved it. Give it a try - there's nothing to loose.

 

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4525701/1/The-French-Affair][*The French Affair*]] - /All is not well: After the Final Battle, Harry's life has settled down and left him unsatisfied. But suddenly, there's a murder, and a chance meeting with the beautiful Fleur Delacour changes things completely... Intrigues and secret projects abound. HP/FD/

Notes: Also incomplete, but it has great potential, in my opinion, to turn into a nice H/F fic.

 

So unfortunately, the fanfiction community finds itself at a shortage for good Harry/Fleur fics. I find Lungs [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showpost.php?p=665450&postcount=1993][*/explains/*]] the reason for this really well over on the [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/][DLP forums]]:

(excerpt)

 

#+begin_quote
  *Shippin'*

  Harry/Ginny - Girl falls in love with her prince charming. They marry and have kids. They name their kids after people they don't know very well, some of which have screwed them rather directly.

  Harry/Hermione - Girl falls in love with her best friend.

  Harry/Hufflepuff - Guy falls in love with the nice girl.

  Harry/Ravenclaw - Guy falls in love with brainy girl who isn't Hermione? Author likes Asian Amateur porn.

  Harry/Slytherin - Hatesex is glorious.

  /These happen. These aren't hyper difficult. These are tropes which are all over our literary works, our culture, all over our every day life, in our relationships and others. We have a POINT OF CONNECTION to them./

  *Now... then it gets a bit... Harrier. Bwahahaha.*

  Harry/Tonks - Guy digs the police chick. They have kinky shapeshifting sex and fight crime. Author might like pegging.

  Harry/Luna - Guy falls in love with the insane girl.

  Harry/Sue - Guy inherits magical powers from the four founders and has a massive penis that the prepz hate.

  The quality severely deteriorates. You have to jump through holes. Tonks may have a personality that's young, but Harry and her have to find a point of connection. Easy, he joins the Unspeakables for an unforgettable summer in being cleared to use the Killing Curse. Ugh. Luna is insane. How many of you know insane girls like Luna? Well, I have a friend who's a little bit of a schizophrenic, maybe she's like him? I have a bunch of Morning Glory seeds to chomp on, maybe I can replicate schizo in my head? Mary Sue? That one's a joke.

  *Then...*

  We have... the ships that are fucking really, really difficult.

  Harry/Blaise's Mom - Harry becomes the Don. He kills people. He enjoys cocaine with his afternoon tea.

  Harry/fem!character - You'd best explain how genderbending's going to work out, dude.

  etc etc.

  And then. We have THE ship.

  *THE SHIP. THAT NEVER. SAILED.*

  Harry/Fleur

  A LEETLE BOY HAS TO IMPRESS A FRENCH SEX SYMBOL FROM A DIFFERENT RACE WHO HAPPENS TO SHARE A PLACE ON THE 0-10 SCALE WITH A VICTORIA SECRET'S ANGEL WHO HAPPENS TO BE THREE YEARS OLDER THAN HIM AND IS THE MOST COMPETENT STUDENT IN AN ENTIRE SCHOOL WITH THE POWER TO MAKE MEN FALL HEAD OVER HEELS BY EXISTING.

  Good. Fucking. Luck.

***** Wow thank you so much, I'll work my way through these over the next few days. I have a week until my job starts so I've been reading like crazy!

I kind of disagree with the Harry/Fleur difficulties. She reminds me a little bit of harry. She is alone, confident on the outside but a little confused and sad on the inside. People are always putting them in boxes and not seeing them as people ( The boy who lived and a Veela )

Its not too large of a stretch to put them together and for Fleur to fall in love with Harry - he is after all brave to a T and super loyal, as well as pretty powerful both magically and politically. Saving her little sister doesn't hurt either. TBH its much easier for me to see than Harry/Tonks.

****** Many things are easier than Harry/Tonks! I agree in that H/F might be easier. After all, Harry and Tonks have no basis to be with each other, besides physical proximity - eg. Grimmauld Place / No. 4 - whereas Fleur and Harry endure hardships in the Tournament.

However, I don't see either of them ever happening. Harry simply isn't mature enough. He's a bit too naive. Whereas Fleur would have 3 entire years on him, maturity from added life experience, Harry still tends to see things in black and white.

******** This is true. Unfortunately, it doesn't often make enjoyable reads - for me, at least.

We must keep in mind that J.K. Rowling's intended audience, until the last two books, was primarily children. A monochrome vision is much easier for children to grasp initially, and much more difficult to change after you've already established it as the basis of the wizarding world for a few books.

********* I have read a few fics that have incorporated this into the plot, and it's always interesting. My point however was that Fleur would likely share harry's monochrome vision. Additionally, a maturity gap of three years is not all that much. Especially if you factor in harry's childhood (doubly so if you view it as outright abusive rather than cannon's veneer due to being a children's book) In fact, I tend to prefer fics that present harry as more mature and pair him with older women, such as Cho, Fleur or Tonks (although cho is a stretch, as while she can be written well, she usually annoys me in FF). This is due to perceiving harry as rater mature for his age.

There was a sequel at one time, /Misericorde and Lily/, that had about 120k words written but I lost interest in posting it for reasons I won't get into here. Suffice it to say that the first few chapters I put up on on ff.net were pretty widely disliked.
