** linkffn(It All Started With A Visit To Gringotts)

Try it. When I first started to read HP fanfics (it was maybe two years ago) I liked it very much.

I still think it's good (it's interesting, big and snarry), but I do see that Harry is really OP here, Harry and Severus are really OOC and it has quite a few very familiar and popular tropes (it was 2008, come on...)

Anyway, just give it a try.

  Voldemort is dead and Harry has finally graduated from Hogwarts and is ready to live his life, but his world is turned upside down when he realizes friends can become enemies and enemies become friends. Powerful Harry. Mild Slash HP/SS

** linkffn(A Bungle in the Jungle) is one of my favourites if you can get past the second person writing.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.
