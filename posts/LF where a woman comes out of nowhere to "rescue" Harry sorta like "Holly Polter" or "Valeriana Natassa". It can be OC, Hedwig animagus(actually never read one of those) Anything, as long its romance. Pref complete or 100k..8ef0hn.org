I'd make it Sirius but any early escape would send the Ministry and Dumbledore into fits of paranoia.

** linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) trilogy is hands-down /the best/ version of this. In my experience, /nothing/ compares. At least - regarding the dynamic you mention - it puts every other fic here to shame.

**** A grounding in Dresden Files actually comes close to ruining the story from this. It's well written. But the central character wouldn't have kept their mind or their sense of self, if it was a Denarian from Butchers works. Instead we get a sympathetic mother/lover figure that's basically supportive and generally doesn't have many goals of note besides supporting Harry in everything. There's a lack of tension to the whole thing because of it. Because there's never a moment where Meciel(That's the name in my head, not sure if it's accurate) comes off as close to as self serving as the Denarians are supposed to be. Nor is there really a moment I recall where there's much conflict with internal forces... Harry doesn't question her, and she really doesn't do anything to deserve questioning... She's just kinda bland...
