I'm interested in finding fics that centre on (or at least include) details of what happened in the 24 hours between when Lily and James died and when Dumbledore had Harry delivered to The Dursleys.

Thanks in advance.


** I'm sorry, I can't think of any fics like that right now, but I just wanted to say that it's really nice to see people noticing bits like that from book one. Wondering if I was the only one! There are a lot of weird details around that day, like Hagrid canonically flying to Surrey via Bristol, which would place him somewhere in southern Wales, and that McGonagall apparently showed up to observe the Dursleys on the morning of the missing day without actually knowing anything about the plan. She has to ask Dumbledore if the rumours are true, and acts almost like she doesn't know Dumbledore very well (calls him 'Headmaster', generally acts nervous and flaky in his presence, etc) for much of chapter 1, despite them later being described as having known each other since the first war.

Basically, PS (or SS for yanks) is a crazy snarl of weirdness in light of later books, because the setting and characters were still very new at the time, and Rowling doesn't re-read her work.

Sorry I can't help out more, but I'll keep an eye out for stuff about this, and if I find one, I'll let you know. Good luck :)

** Read this one a long time ago, don't remember much about it:

Also, chapters 56 and 57 of this fic cover that time period, from McGonagall's perspective:
