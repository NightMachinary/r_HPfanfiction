Maybe he finds Sirius too unstable, or isn't comfortable with the way Sirius sometimes calls him James for some reason or another. Or that Remus isn't reliable, either, and Harry doesn't trust the way he never came to see him or tell he knew his parents, etc.


** How about where he forgives Sirius but not Remus?

** In linkffn(On the Way to Greatness) Harry is a lot less trusting and selfless. I remember he and Sirius are not close at all. I don't remember his relationship with Remus but I don't think it's a fond one either.
