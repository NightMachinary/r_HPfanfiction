Comedy fic, of course.

I'd love to see what shenanigans would result from this.


** Death plays dirty. It's 1e, no one in the party has played before, and the module is Tomb of Horrors.

At least ToH and 1e are fun...

***** I feel the need to point this out.

Do you want to win, or do you want to have fun?

Death would choose to win. Just saying.

****** Oh, no. Everyone in the game loses with GURPS. The entire universe loses when someone cracks open the PDF for FATAL.

** Plot twist.

The entire Harry Potter series was just a massive game of D&D

*** I must admit to having /shamelessly/ cribbed the Harry Potter series for a D&D campaign before. My entire party wanted to play wizards, someone wanted to play as a Kid Hero which made the rest of the group decide on doing the same, so I made up (read: Cribbed from Harry Potter, as well as the Earthsea series) a campaign that took place entirely in a school for magically-gifted children.
