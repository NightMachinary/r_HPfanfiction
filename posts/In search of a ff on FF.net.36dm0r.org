Harry Potter run away from the Dursleys' after his 2nd year, He is in a pub (not the Leaky Cauldron, but a muggle one) and decides to 'go home' with some stranger - that if he can be abused then he can have sex - and he approaches this guy with black hair. The guy is Sirius Black and takes Harry to Grimmauld. Harry tells him he's sixteen (or seventeen) and that his name is James. They passes the summer together. Then they meet again at the end of the school year in the Shag and realize who the other is and swear to stop "it", Remus in the while had discovered everything and is ready to kill Sirius or something. Someone knows it? I can't find it anymore and I don't remember the title! Thak you all.


** So a 12 year old says he's 17 and Sirius believes him and they fuck and then a year later they meet and they're like oh shit?

**** Come on, I didn't say it was a GOOD fanfiction, just that I wanted to find it again. If it's any better to you he is 13 and says to be 16, because 'oh yeah, everyone thinks I look older anyway' and three chapters later 'the abuse of the Dursley left him short and skinny'. As I said not a good fic, not even well written, but there's a sort of sick curiosity when after years you think about it and can't FIND it.
