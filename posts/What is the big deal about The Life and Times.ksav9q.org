Is it worth the read?


** It's probably the most popular James/Lily fic around. Although, there's no actual James/Lily until the very end of what's posted. I'd personally rate it a 2 or 2.5/5.

I really don't like Lily in this fic. I already consider canon Lily a doormat (staying friends with Snape even after he was calling every muggleborn but her a mudblood) but it's worse in this fic.

- Lily remained friends with Snape after the events of Snape's Worst Memory.
- Lily healed a death eater, the brother of her boyfriend. Even after said death eater was a complete bigoted dick to her.
- Lily snuck out of school to protect said boyfriend who is going to warn his death eater brother of the aurors.

The OCs (or characters that are so minor in canon that they might as well be OCs) are hit or miss. I thought Carlotta Meloni, Mary MacDonald, and Charlie Plex were interesting. The rest not so much.

It also retells the same events from multiple perspectives. So you might feel that the story drags a bit in some parts.

*** Agree generally with these points, and it's also worth noting that it is not and will never be completed. So after you devote all that time to reading, the ending is a bit of a disappointment because, in addition to a lot of loose ends with the side characters, you don't actually see James and Lily get together, just a flash forward to the future where they're already dating.

*** I never made it that far into the story, but Lily was the reason why I dropped it as well

** Some valid criticism has been mentioned. I really think TLATâ€˜s strengths are also its weaknesses: itâ€˜s a genuine slow burn, but imo too slow. Itâ€˜s beautifully written, but it sometimes feels like Jules is losing herself in her beautiful words, instead of letting the plot progress. It pays attention to side characters and world building, but again that happens at the expense of the plot.

I loved reading TLAT and I reread it from time to time, but the older I get the more OOC James and Lily seem. James is portrayed as this hyper cool badass, when we know he was a total nerd. A nerd who enjoyed some popularity perhaps but certainly not the James Dean level cool guy he is in TLAT. Itâ€˜s more what I imagined Sirius Black to be like.

I like that Lily is depicted as smart and kind in a way that letâ€˜s you believe she could manage to pull off Harry later, but she is also def a bit too soft.

What I like most is that their relationship actually grows in a believable way.

** It's worth reading to see the hype. The narrative is good and conversational I really liked that. And there was a lot of side story happening rather than just focusing on the relationship so like, I was genuinely interested to see what would happen.

It's probably not the best Jily fic but it is good. I don't like romance or people who are all cutesy and in love. This story is more of a pining, angry, stubborn fic where the two stubbornly hate eachother the entire time which I really enjoyed because I'm evil ðŸ˜Š.

It's not my favourite fic. But it is well written and a good enjoyable read. I would recommend it.
