What are your guy's opinions on soulmate au's? Personally I really don't like the concept even if the overall writing of the story is good. The reason for this is because of the lack of free will in the story and how it ties in with predestination. I especially hate it when authors combine the concept of soulmates with the enemies to lovers trope.

The characters have no choice and even when they detest each other and try to do everything in their power to fight their preconceived destiny they still somehow end up together or just give up. And that is why this concept scares me because there is no choice in the matter (at least in most of the fanfics I've read) and whatever they do to thwart their fate life still makes it so that they are still with each other because... They are ‚ÄúSoulmates‚Äù that seems more like a horror story to me then a love story.

I hate the helplessness and inevitability of it all it's like well you hate each other but there is nothing you can do you are still bound by this arbitrary cosmic force so just suck it up. And this is supposed to be romantic somehow? I am by no means judging anyone who likes this trope and maybe there is something that I'm missing, but I've always preferred the idea of people choosing to be together or forging their own destinies rather than be dictated by external forces. And it makes me heartbroken when the protagonist of these stories have valid reasons not to want to be together but somehow they have to succumb to the inevitability of having to be together i.e. being bound.


** That's why I prefer stories in which the characters, on their own free will, make the conscious decision to become soulmates.

  Effectively it can be used to say that people aren't accountable for their actions and can't be punished for it (as you can consider it coercion of sorts).
#+end_quote

There really isn't a meaning to this sentiment in determinism. People aren't being punished for their actions; outcomes occur. Sometimes those outcomes are 'good', other times they are 'bad', but they are already determined.

  Perhaps, as the hard determinist suggests, we are justified in holding people responsible only in order to influence future behavior.
#+end_quote

In a deterministic system, what is the significance of justification? Things happen because they happen. Justification requires some other alternative possibility.

And how is future behavior influenceable? Things that will happen, will happen; not due to cause and effect, at least as generally envisioned, but because initial conditions demand it.

The problem with the description, at least as it is presented here, is that, if people are not free and, thus, not responsible for their actions, then how is one free to decide to hold people responsible? Or to punish them?

The problem, I believe, is one of language. Regardless of truth, the manner of construction of the English language implies free will. Writing sentences in which there is an 'actor', e.g., a human, but their actions, and others responses to them, are determined is really counter-intuitive.

*** I don't remember what the name was, but there was one marriage contract-y fic that was played a little more realistically than most (something about preventing squibs by matching magical auras because the post-war generation couldn't afford it) and Draco and Astoria end up together despite their magical auras not actually being compatible because they lie about their results, and choose each other.

I always thought that was really nice. Like the one completely status quo couple was subverting what was "correct."

** You know, I saw so many fluffy soulmate AUs I didn't like for the same reason and I couldn't say why, and when I finally came across one that was more of a horror story it helped me solidify or articulate the same feeling as you. And those are the stories I enjoy: ones that deconstruct a trope or genre like soulmates and show that, hey - this could possibly be super messed up!

I love that when people take a trope and show it realistically, and it's actually really uncomfortable or intense. I've seen probably only two marriage fics I can remember where it read very similarly to my friends' parents experience who had arranged marriages - awkward, slow, not fluffy and only eventually coming to something like an allegiance and careful affection. Another one is, oh god - any ABO profoundly lacks consent. If it were real life, people would have PTSD. Instead of being an omega getting taken by the sexy Alpha fuccboi Draco Malfoy you're just as likely to have some middle aged, unattractive dude who works at a corner store and isn't gonna be much of a fantasy panting over you and abrogating your free and informed consent.

Oh yeah. I still haven't seen a teacher/student fic where the dynamic is explored for what it is - pretty uncomfortable and exploitative and usually associated with grooming.

So many tropes bend consent, agency, autonomy and I just love when an author uncomfortably shines the light on it for an ‚Äúemperor's clothes‚Äù moment where you're reading it going, ah, yes, this is actually pretty yuck. Thanks for, uh, showing the people.

Props to those authors. I live for those stories that deconstruct the trope.

*** Thank you!! I fucking hate A/B/O and I can't understand why it's so popular. It seems like its hallmarks are gender-based sexual slavery and "pheromones" as justification for rape?

I hate hate /hate/ the implication that a certain "gender" (the one that can carry a pregnancy) is biologically mandated to be subservient to the other and forced to accept unwanted sexual advances. And the exchange is that the gender raping them will "protect" and provide for them?

Some authors try to wince around the consent issue (not that there's ever been a fic where a "no" is respected in the end), but the gender = role thing is still deeply fucked up.

**** I don't enjoy it a bit at all so don't take this comment as a defence of ABO because I hate it personally.

But! from my friends who do enjoy that genre, and who critically engage with those themes, they seem to enjoy it because it combines a lot of taboos and (usually) has the main character have no ‚Äúchoice‚Äù but to voraciously sexually enjoy those circumstances. For a lot of people, sex is taboo and they're shamed for enjoying it - so it's a kind of sexual liberation. Some writers are more careful about those themes and others really lean in to the more troublesome aspects uncritically and without apparent awareness and those writers also seem really young. I do worry sometimes? That people writing this stuff may not be of age? But that's another monkey for another circus.

***** I'm actually somewhat in the opposite frame of mind as [[/u/gertrude-robinson]] on this---I'm totally fine with non-consent as a kink ("consensual non-consent" in real life). Sex pollen, dom/sub, mind-altering drugs, random kidnapping, tentacles grabbing you through the shower drain? No problem---we understand it's fiction.

For me the problem with A/B/O isn't the sex (as in, "intercourse"), what makes me uncomfortable is the fantasy of one gender (really, sex assigned at birth, not that it ever seems to differ in A/B/O fics) having basically unrestricted power over the other, as a /fact/ of gender. In these fantasies, consent isn't between individuals, it's a disturbing societal phenomenon where equal rights do not (and maybe can not) exist.

To me, A/B/O serves as a vehicle to both *1)* get rid of female characters---if they /must/ exist, 98% of the time they're betas and irrelevant (finally no more gross vaginas!!)---and *2)* strip any agency from the gender that can get pregnant and reduce them to brainless baby-makers with no other reason to live.

The soulmate stuff is consent issues and a big heap of determinism. A/B/O is less about consent and more about oppressive gender roles. If the writers/readers aren't of age... I'd rather they read porn than stuff with a fucked-up worldview like this.

So, you seem to be fine with people exploring more taboo kinks (rape, non-con, etc) via fiction, since it's fiction and not real, but A/B/O takes it too far. It crosses a line because rather than it be a non-con relationship/sex between individuals the fiction is about society as a whole and includes submissive second class citizens with little to no rights (or at least no say in the relationship) and essentially the rape is systematic. That seems to be your issue with it, please correct me if I'm wrong.

My confusion is that it's still just a kink being explored in fiction. Like, I understand the deeper implications if someone were to take it seriously and actually try to promote the ideas that are spread within the story, but as you said for other non-con fiction, we know it's fiction and not real. So I don't really see why a line is being crossed here. If someone were to think that the fic is actually promoting the idea of second-class citizen sexual slavery then the same could be said about any other non-con fic promoting rape.

Unless I'm completely misunderstanding your comment and you just meant that you are comfortable reading those other fics but not with A/B/O fics because of those reasons, and not that you are actually against them being written.

******* To be clear---I'm not trying to have a fight with anyone, I've just put a lot of thought into my strong feelings on this subject.

My personal approach to life is generally "live and let live"---I'm not interested in evangelizing or imposing my morals on anyone. If I don't like someone's porn, I won't read it. But this is a bit of a special case. I think A/B/O is actually harmful because it's poorly explored. I know it looks like a double standard, but let me clarify.

A lot of kinky stuff, especially in writing, shades into some morally grey areas. Non-con is the tip of the freaky iceberg---there are huge sub-categories like body modification, torture/brainwashing, breeding/human farming, and so on. On reddit, porn tropes like raping your step-sister are memed to high heaven. Any of those taken "seriously" in real life would clearly be wrong. In fact, a big part of what makes something a kink in the first place is that it's taboo.

I don't believe anyone wants to take A/B/O any more seriously than any other kinks. For me it's that the specific taboos explored by A/B/O fics are poorly defined, even by authors, and as a consequence the parallels with real life are poorly defined.

For example, it's easy to play out (most) non-consent kinks in real life with a consenting partner. But what's the real-life equivalent for A/B/O? Is it an mpreg/breeding kink? Is it dominance/submission? Humiliation? Bestiality/furry kink?

Any of those are fine by me. My problem is that there's another, less obvious "layer" involved with A/B/O---the concept of second-class citizens with no free will. That second layer is both an intrinsic part of the A/B/O trope and rarely a kink itself, because it's rarely articulated. In fact, it's not even really taboo---women being second class citizens is fact in a /lot/ of the world.

A/B/O and the implied horrors of A/B/O society are usually just a vehicle for other kinks. It /may/ be possible that some writers/readers want to explore the horror of gender-based sexual slavery (not that the "alphas" have much choice either), but it's pretty rare. So the trope gets rolled into fics that just want mpreg (etc) and the gender discrimination isn't really a fantasy but just a convenient reason for characters to fuck.

We all understand that rape is bad. But because the parallel to real life isn't obvious, it's almost never acknowledged that "A/B/O /society/ is bad."

It's not that the idea of second-class citizen sexual slavery is being /promoted/---it's pretty much not discussed at all. The problem is that it actually does exist in real life, and these fics implicitly accept it.

Because really would you trust someone who could turn at any moment into a sex-driven half-animal with anything of importance. You can't trust them in any education facility, because the students could turn any moment into an omaga or alpha, and then you need the teacher to be able to take charge with a clear mind. So teachers would be betas and that mean they form the basis for the education and society. Would you put a an alpha or omega into a position of sensitive security? No because they could turn sex-crazy any moment. Would you want them to be your surgent or even your busdriver?

****** I actually agree with you and I don't think our opinions differ too much. For me not liking soulmate au isn't about having the moral high-ground. And as a kink I can understand that non-consent/consent can be a type of fantasy/escapism bdsm thing. But as you've mentioned above when it's just a fact of society something bound by unknown external forces and you don't even realize that you don't have agency unlike in kidnappings etc... it becomes more of an existential horror for me. Like imagine if somebody told you that whatever you do in your life you will eventually fulfill this soulmate destiny because its ‚Äúfate‚Äù and no matter what action you do you will simply fulfill that fate like a puppet. That's personally more scary to me then the kinks you say that you enjoy. Because they don't pretend to be anything other than they are it's just a consent/nonconsent kink. But with Soulmate au when the characters don't even understand that they don't actually have any free will or consent because of laws and external powers as you've said then it's personally really scary to me. But yeah I'm not judging anyones tastes of course and totally agree with your insights on abo and gender roles.

******* Yeah I definitely think we're both saying stuff that we already agree on! I think you hit the nail on the head with describing it as sort of "existentially" horrific as opposed to situationally. For me it's deeply disturbing for nonconsent to be a fact to such an extent that consent isn't even really an option. Whether it's biology as in A/B/O or something more abstract like in soulmate fics.

I guess A/B/O tends to have more obvious "it's not rape if they like it" or "no no no yes" kinds of scenes (the trope is almost always explicit) but I see what you mean about Soulmate AUs. In a way the soulmate trope is even more unsettling for its lack of explicitness---nobody is being held down/raped/bitten (although it occurs to me now that the "permanent marking" is actually a hallmark of Soulmate AUs)---the nonconsent is less immediately obvious and more insidious for it.

******** EXACTLY! When the nonconsent isn't even obvious it's definitely more insidious in my opinion. Because you never even knew that there was an option. Idk the lack of awareness is chilling and can be drawn parallels to real life Orwellian stuff. When you don't even know what you're reading is propaganda or that you are being brainwashed. Kind of like in Plato's cave were the people watching the shadows aren't even aware that something else exists vs the one person who's forcefully kept their with chains having knowledge of the outside world. Anyways sorry for the weird tangent. I enjoyed your comments so much. You put everything that I couldn't articulate so eloquently in to words.

It's not my personal cup of tea but I can understand why as a fantasy you might enjoy those kinks in media/literature because there is a fight going on a power struggle an awareness to it which can be found enjoyable just because of that struggle. But it's overt rather than covert.

******* A /lot/ of it (like a lot a lot) is slash stuff. I haven't done the research to say for sure, but I'm pretty sure A/B/O started in the slash community. It's a combo of the good old mpreg trope (which preceded it in popular use by at least a decade, I'd guess) with "wolf pack dynamics" (which I suspect evolved from general dom/sub kinks).

It definitely /exists/ for het pairings, but it's much less common. A quick search of the tag [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Alpha*s*Beta*s*Omega%20Dynamics/works][on AO3]] gives me 65k M/M fics and 12k F/M fics. The categories are definitely skewed by people tagging side-pairings (if I filter on F/M, I still see maybe 70% M/M fics), but the difference in number is huge. Part of that is just that slash is popular.

But aside from the rare femslash fic, almost none of them feature female characters as the ones in power. It's always male = alpha, female = omega, unsexy = beta.

****** I don't think it's fair to assume A/B/O or soulmates are only about wish fulfillment for men or people who picture themselves as dominant in these scenarios.

Life can be a lot. For everyone. Responsibilities aren't all the same, but we've all got them.

Pay the bills. Go to work. Deal with different managers wanting different people. Deal with different people in your personal life wanting different things from you. Tidy the house. Clean the house. Go to the doctor. Manage your illnesses. Exercise. Cook. Eat. Brush your teeth, every day, forever.

It can be overwhelming. Some people don't cope well. Some people fail at taking care of themselves. And some people's parents failed to care for them or protect them when they were children.

When you're a kid, maybe you fantasize about your parent loving you or taking care of you. And there's nothing wrong with you for wanting that.

When you're an adult, and struggle to take care of yourself, and are miserable, maybe you fantasize about a romantic/sexual relationship with someone who will take care of you. But you know you're an adult and you're supposed to be able to take care of yourself, and you can't, or feel like you can't.

Maybe you feel like you are just incapable of taking care of yourself. But in your fantasy, you don't want it to be your fault. So you write about a group of people, or gender, or whatever, who just magically do need someone to take care of them. You get to fantasize, guilt free, about a total lack of responsibility for yourself or others. And all your needs, sexual and otherwise, are met.

I feel gross about soul bonding and ABO and whatever else because they are non con, whether that's acknowledged in the fic or not.

But I'm overwhelmed with life, and sometimes the escapism of not being responsible for anything is nice. And I'm lonely and worried no one I want will ever love me, and that I'll always make bad choices about who to date, and sometimes the escapism of a soul mate, and not being responsible for finding or choosing or staying with someone or not feels really good.

In real life magic can't find people the best partner. And (of course) I don't want to give up my free will and the freedom I buy with responsibility.

I don't know whether it's okay for people to be writing or reading this shit. But I definitely don't think it's all about catering people who want that dominant role

Look I'm not saying that I haven't read any ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù or dark stories that I've liked. But the key thing for me is that there was a choice whether that be good or bad can depend. But with ABO/soulmate/ and teacher student relationships the helplessness of having no choice and not being able to rebel against those constraints is really horrifying to me. Just imagine if somebody told you that the person you hate or even the person you potentially love is your soulmate and no matter what you do the universe will somehow bind you to make decisions that will make you guys be together. How is that not humiliating and petrifying?

**** Call me crazy but I only have ever enjoyed those tropes when they're presented by the author critically and as a horror. And I actually enjoy those fics. Give me more critical horror AUs! I don't have any to rec on hand sorry, I'm on my phone atm.

If someone told me that my soulmate was my high school teacher (like a lot of cross-gen fics) I would pretty much have a panic attack and get therapy. And even if the universe gravitated me towards them I think I'd always have a flicker of fear there. I wouldn't settle into fluffy romance life. I would also be extremely uncomfortable with them remaining in close proximity with kids. And also the propensity for abuse is truly extreme. Even if it never happened I wouldn't feel safe. Maybe that's my control issues talking.

Psychoanalysis incoming: Loss of agency is a very common trope in romance. One reason is that it permits a reader to be forced into loving/having sex with someone without any of the ‚Äúblame‚Äù of those circumstances arising, so there's no culpability in enjoying it. This is even present in romance fics of the early 20th century so it's no new trope and I won't shame. Some people just like to helplessly feel seduced to evade the culpability of enjoyment, especially with anything taboo.

I'm just on the other end of that spicy spectrum haha. As soon as there's a ‚Äúsexy‚Äù loss of autonomy I'm like eject!! Wheres that back button! My is that the time I better close this browser! üòÇ

  When Maria Hill was seven years old, she asked her grandmother---the only person she'd ever known with a soulmate---what it was like to be bonded to someone else. Her grandmother had smiled this sweet, tender smile and talked about safety and warmth and home, and to this day that's what Maria thinks of whenever she sees a soulbonded couple. But when she'd asked her grandmother why she'd quit a promising career, Gran had said it was for her husband. Maria had vowed then and there that she'd never be soulbonded to someone else if it meant giving up her independence.Steve Rogers never knew anyone who'd been soul bonded. He knew that the chances of finding your soulmate were slim, and who'd want a scrawny, asthmatic kid from Brooklyn anyway. And then he'd met Peggy Carter. She was everything Steve had hoped for in a soulmate. Too bad she wasn't his, although it might have been a blessing in disguise. He couldn't image the pain in knowing that you'd found your soulmate only to lose them in the next moment. And when he woke up sixty years in the future, he figured he'd missed his chance. So when it happens to them, it's both everything and nothing like they'd expected.

This really depends on the setting. Hermione/Snape for example, no. Just no. Or Lupin for that matter.

But let's say that Alicia Spinnet is hired straight out of Hogwarts to teacher Runes and Harry ends up in a relationship with her during his 7th year, that's not really problematic tbh since she has very little authority over him (he is not in her class) and the age difference is 2 years (17/19) at that point.

*** I have had an idea for a oneshot somewhat similar to this, but with a twist: while romance is far from guranteed (and in fact has nothing to do with the soulbond itself directly -- in the universe I have in mind, Fred and George has a soulbond that they use for pranks more than anything, being able to sense each other's feelings and sometimes thoughts which is really the only thing a soulbond does), the fact that soulbonds lead to the best romances is a common /myth/, sometimes with unfortunate consequences for the people believing it.

The scenario I had in mind was an incident that happens around 1982ish with a young Professor Snape encounters a group of teenage girls talking about how romantic it would be to have a soulmate. Distressed, he quickly disabuse them of the notion, pointing out the pitfalls of thinking like that, deducts points and give them detention in his usual Snape-ish manner. Because in the past, he had a soulbond with Lily, and the young Severus had done the very same assumption that these girls did about soulbonds meaning an inevitable romance. And this assumption was partly the reason why their friendship shattered (and any chance of there ever being more), because he took her friendship (and future love) for granted rather than trying to talk to her properly and take her concerns in the serious way that he ought to have ("meh, I know things will turn out well in the end, I'll just ignore the problems and they'll eventually go away"), which could have prevented the destruction in first place.

Or maybe even a Lovecraftian horror were the cosmic forces that determine things like soulmates are arbitrary, forceful, and ultimately meaningless but people are still trying to put meaning to it assuming that its part of their destiny or grand design. Basically a blind idiot God in the form of a magical avatar telling you that you have no will and will submit to your soulmate role.

** The lack of free will definitely sucks. it's much better when there are good examples of romantic and platonic relationships between soulmates.

I just read a fic last night where there is a magical force (in this case geese that magically appeared) and they would drag you to your soulmate. kiss and the geese are gone for good. you don't have to stay with your soulmate at all and there's no societal pressure to do so.

Also, seriously, geese in all their geese-ness. was hilarious.

** I agree completely. I don't mind as much if authors explore the issues involved (like the stigma of dating someone who isn't your soulmate), but I overall dislike the idea. Predestination is certainly an issue with it, but to me I also dislike the idea that there is only 1 right person out there. What if they die? What if you never meet them? What if they are abusive? The idea that you should stay with someone simply because they are your soulmate is disturbing. And the idea that if you don't meet (or lose) your soulmate then you'll never be happy is just depressing.

Weirdly enough I hate soulmates, but I can deal with "mates" in some instances with creature fics. Perhaps because it would affect a much smaller percentage of society and because often only one side feels the draw. Some of them are just as bad though (or worse).

** Yeah, this has always bothered me. I do like the representation of bonds through magic, though. A popular trope is that when someone touches you, your skin turns a certain colour depending on your relationship with them. I like this better because the colour can change and it depends on your feelings for them, not some predetermined outcome, but it's still a physical comfirmation. Also, it allows me to write some super painful oneshots about accepting that you have fallen out of love with someone or still being in love after a breakup, but moving on because the relationship couldn't have worked.

** I absolutely /love/ stories with soulmates - and all I read is basically enemies to lovers. I love the conflict there, I love how the author has to be talented enough to somehow make two people so /wrong/ for each other /right/ for each other. Like Beauty and the Beast. ‚ÄúJust a little change small to say the least‚Äù.

I get where having no choice in the matter could be off putting. I've only read one book where they had no choice, though they weren't soulmates, that actually put me off of it. This was just because Harry was so against it. Even in the ending of the series he was still so against it. It was a confusing and just freaking sad read. Harry would start to be like ‚Äúthis is ok. I could love him.‚Äù Then bam! ‚Äúthis is so wrong. I'm traumatized. Omg he held my hand ew.‚Äù I dunno if it was intentional by the author or if she couldn't think of any other form of conflict but it sucked, which is really sad cuz it's not as popular as a pairing but I don't even wanna reread it. So, I definitely see where your coming from. I like the tropes but I don't want it to be forced or basically non-con the entire way through it. I like for Harry to have a good ending at least, even if this pairing wasn't Harry's first choice.

*** I love enemies to lovers! The only problem I have is when authors put this cosmic force were they are basically bound to each other and it's their ‚Äúdestiny‚Äù to be together. Because then I question if they actually gradually fell in love or is it just the predestination that is dictating their action. If they will inevitably fall in love then there is no suspense for me. But if the trope is enemies to lovers with lots of conflicts and they fall in love despite there being no external force just because they chose to it makes me more excited. But I totally get your point too. I am personally a very stubborn person so when someone tells me that I will ‚Äúinevitably‚Äù make that decision or make any such other claims I purposefully do the opposite so I guess soulmates in a way triggers the helplessness of other people saying ‚Äú I told you so‚Äù you were meant for each other etc...

So I was already okay with the trope. I get how not having a choice could be off putting. Usually with soulmates you /can/ walk away. It's just no one will ever be as perfect for you. There is one book I read where not being with your soulmate can kill you. And it was off putting actually. I didn't like it at all. The author made it clear if you reject your soulmate then you'll die, but then the characters in the book were all like ‚Äúhe can leave me at any moment! Find someone new and forget about me!‚Äù Etc.

** I had an interesting discussion over in the Harry/Fleur discord about this topic. The general consensus wad that soulbonds, as they are commonly presented, are garbage. But that it could be explored in an interesting manner. The premise we came up with was a situation in which a soulbond is something develops over time between people, and as it develops they begin to be able to sense each others thoughts and emotions, (classic soulbond powers), but that over time the people in the bond will have their consciousness blend together so that it stops being sensing each others thoughts and emotions, and become that they share the same thoughts and emotions. Eventually becoming a single consciousness inhabiting two bodies which is created from the fusion of its constituent consciousnesses.

Story drama could arise from this process as people might be afraid of losing themselves, people with weak personalities might be completely lost in the consciousness of a partner with a more forceful personality.

**** Yep, although it's not so much an intentional choice to form and develop the bond as it is a natural consequence of being in a close enough relationship with a person, in which case the choice is about being with the person rather than regarding the bond specifically. That way it is impossible to separate the relationship from the bond, and the only way to avoid the bond forming is to intentionally limit the relationship. Full on merging of consciousness would probably take significant intentional effort to develop the connection getting to know each other on an extremely intimate level, but after a while being in a relationship the initial stages of the bond are unavoidable.

I started working on a soulmate AU fic -- for a different fandom -- where I plan (read: never will because I'm very good at starting things but not at continuing them) to explore that concept more, because one of the main themes of that piece of media is how these kinds of bonds should not be forced through supernatural means and that people should be free to make their own choices. (I got the idea after reading a soulmate AU fic for that fandom and I was like. Well. I mean. That completely clashes with the themes of the original work. And it didn't go addressed.

** Actually, I read a Soulmate au from another fandom (Stony) in which one party was not able to view their soul mark (light shining from chest when touching soulmate) due to the fact that they had something grafted over their chest. As the story played out, they both fell in love of their own accord, even in spite of the fact that they were both under the impression that they were not soulmates (and thus, subject to the scrutiny of the public, for pursuing such a relationship). I think in this case it was particularly meaningful because they made the choice to stay together and pursue the relationship together even without the certainty of the soul mark to fall back on.

Nevertheless, I suppose that's one of the rarer cases, though I do see this trope pop up from time to time.

Honestly though, personally, I do like Soulmate aus, even the common ones. Part of the appeal might be the (relative) certainty that both parties have, that no matter the circumstance, they will always ultimately have each other. I guess I don't tend to see it as a lack of free will but more of a case in which the universe gives soulmates more chances/opportunities than it usually would, to make the choices that allow them to eventually be together.

For instance, in the case of the enemies-to-lovers trope, I wouldn't really see it as a case of them being forced to stay together in the end despite hating each others guts (at least not in fics that I've read?), I'll perceive it to be a case of fate or circumstance giving them the time or space needed to get to know each other better and really sift through each others layers and fall in love. (While in the case that they are not soulmates/meant to be, they might've just written each other off for good and never properly gotten to know each other.)

Uhm I don't know if that makes sense? I do see your point about the lack of agency thing though.

But also I really recommend that Stony fic I mentioned! I forgot the name but if I ever find it I'll put it here.

My way of fixing it is that the bond only indicates an extremely high level of compatibility. They aren't punished for being apart or trapped. In fact, only one person in the pairing is even aware of the bond and has no clue why the other is around him ALL. THE. TIME.

** It all comes back to agency - any premise or plot that denies the characters agency is a problem unless it's /about/ the denial of agency and the struggles that result. This is even an issue in the canon, as Trelawney's second prophecy (and to some degree the first, depends on interpretation) denies any agency by the characters.

Whether it's soulmates, prophecy, or anything else, it should support the characters' agency rather than diminish it (again, unless the plot is a Final Destination-esque "oh f**k we're stuck").

I have seen soulmates done well a time or two and acceptably several more. Non-problematic soulmate stories either have soul-bonding be a choice by the bonded (one of the things I really liked in "Banking on Her" by RobSt), make soul mates just people that are super-compatible (romantically or otherwise) and reinforce any love that does develop, and/or give people multiple potential soul mates to pick any/all/none from.

** Agreed!

The idea itself is nice but I genuinely hate how almost every soulmate au I read literally forces two people into a romantic relationship. It has come to a point where a few feels way too non-consensual and... Well, I just really don't like it when a relationship is forced.

Not to mention, I know for a fact that soulmates doesn't automatically mean romantic relationship. Soulmates, depending on which country, can also include platonic soulmates. So, why force two characters who clearly doesn't have romantic attraction when they can be the ultimate best friend? Wouldn't best friends be so much cuter and fluffier?

I dunno... This is just my opinion.

** Soulmate fictions remind me of forced arranged marraiges and a very real reality. It's a lays interesting how an author spins stories with a enemy to lover plot but I usually find that the characters either resolve their issues or hate fuck but that also depends on the author's rules of said soul bonds. I've read fiction where they have marks but aren't together - friendly to strangers - while on the other hand I've read angst to some dark suicidal theme's. I love them, I love how it's spun and the enemies to mate's is my trope or the angst/sad of one mate rejecting their soulmate.

Although I have seen a interesting twist on this more than once. For instance its where Lily and Severus are soul mates and lily is slowly but surely hating severus because of how he acts toward people (Claiming She's :Different :than other muggleborns when confronted About him hanging with deatheaters, Acting possessive) The real kicker is that this is one of those "where whatever you write on your skin appears on the others skin" sorta fics. when he gets "That" on him she wakes up one morning to find a matching pair on her arm too. She basically goes off on him in the great hall and swears a Binding Oath that cuts the cord between them. Humiliating Snape and letting her choose who she wants.

With What you are saying I think that the definition of soulmate can differ. I'm talking more about the common soulmate/soul-marking trope in fanfics that inhibit the main characters from having a choice, putting negative consequences, or more insidiously never even show that they actually have a free will or choice in the first place due to external supernatural forces. For sure in general terms soulmate does not need to be sexual it can be platonic. But I'm just generally talking about the trope of soulmate and predestination in fanfics.

**** Ehhhhhh I'm not sure if beautiful is the right word for our bond. Haha. It's been forged in the fires of hell and a mutual belief of no matter what we're in this together :) Yuppers :) like I said, just an excuse for writers to mash the characters like dolls together. If it was done right though? I feel it could be a beautiful thing. Love is tricky. Writing it out? One of the most difficult feels to bring out. Actually taking a workshop on it. It's easy to say:

As their eyes met in a crowd there seemed to be a moment where the world paused, the hub of surrounding chatter dulled, and without realizing it, they gravitated towards each other like two magnets in an ever developing nexus of magic, courcing through the surroundings.

Then say:

As Ron stormed out of the tent, his face set in a snarl, he hurled the locket into Hermione's face then aperating away in a chaotic swirl of magic. Harry stood there as an unwilling and devastated witness for the death of his friends relationship till he rushed over and wrapped his best friend up in his arms; holding her while she felt her heart sunder in two. He could feel her pain, feel her soul wrenching out in the anguish of sacrificing her parents, friends, status, everything behind in the hope of a future no one was convinced was a posibilty. Looking into her eyes, he whispered "well, at least there's no dragons in the next task." To which she hiccuped a short snort of laughter.

** Oh yes I hate that! :) I started writing a bit of a soulmate fic where soulmates become physically bound to be near each other, and they can sense each other's thoughts and emotions, but that's IT! What their relationship is or becomes from there is entirely left up to them. They could be friends, or ignore each other and try to work around it to live their own lives, or they could become romantic partners. I had Dumbledore explain that most soulbonds between two people stayed purely platonic, and that it was actually rare for them to become romantic together.

I treated it more like a terrible medical condition than some mystical romance plotforce.

It was something both people didn't like or want, and it came about as an accident, and everyone around them really just pitied them for being stuck in it. :( It was something they had to work together to deal with, but that didn't mean they had to get closer to each other in any other ways. They could even keep hating each other.

I am a huge lover of FREE WILL! So I preserved that with both the soulbonded people's minds even when bonded. Their minds were entirely unaltered and unaffected. No stupid force twisting them to love each other, forcing them to feel attracted to each other. That's as sick as the Imperius, or love potions.

** I think it depends on your definition. There are certainly cases where people just 'click', when you just get each other's jokes, understand and are able to read each other, etc. Equally, there are 'slow burns' where friends or even enemies can naturally grow to respect and love each other. I think it's interesting to explore a rejection of soul bonds: what if they fight back, what if soul bonds are fake. I think one reason why soul bond fanfics are so popular is because Harry Potter, at least imo, is about wish fulfillment. It's an attempt at escapism, which means that you are expected to suspend disbelief in an attempt to 'feel special'. Many people want to take comfort in the idea that there is a 'perfect one' for them somewhere out there, usually after their existing relationships don't work. It's an unhealthy but surprisingly realistic symptom of modern society, given that digitalisation and personalisation has made us more self-centered. I was, and probably am still among those afflicted by this despite trying hard to change.

*** The whole Harry Potter story in it's entirety is a story of wish fulfillment and I think that's a beautiful think. We all need escapism and fantasy, so when I say that ‚ÄúI hate soulmates‚Äù I don't mean to sound like I'm condemning anyone from a moral standpoint.

The more accurate thing would be that the external force that dictates who is going to be Soulmates scares me and fills me with existential dread because it reminds me of hard determinism and how you can't run away from your destiny. More often than not in soulmate stories when the characters even accidentally separate something negative happens, or when it's enemies to lovers and they genuinely want to get away this smug external force makes every situation so that they just get closer to each other. Which makes me question whether that relationship developed naturally or not.

What I'm trying to say is I'm not even trying to bash anyone's ideas of true love who am I to do that? I think that's a sweet ideal. But I'm more critical of the covert predestination in those stories. The idea that even though you're enemies and you hate each other whatever action you try to make will only make you closer to each other and you won't even realize this in the end. Because then I feel like what choice did you have in the beginning? I don't know If you've ever watched stranger than fiction the movie, but in there the main protagonist is actually the character of an author and he starts hearing the author narrate his life. He falls in love with a baker because she said so he does certain things because the author has written it. And even when he tries to defy it, it still somehow comes true. The love between this baker and mc is cute but I can't help but feel like how much of it is coercion? Anyways sorry for the long rant again I'm not actually bashing the idea of soulmates it's the idea of having no choice that genuinely scares me but that's just my opinion. Everyone deserves to have their fantasies and I totally understand people who like soulmates and were they are coming from. In a sea of uncertainty the idea of having the certainty of a soulmate seems very appealing. And I think there is nothing wrong with indulging that in stories‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è

** I like soulmates AU when the whole 'soulmate' thing is more diverse. Like, not that you have one soulmate which is the only person you have to love and without them you're as well as dead. Nope, that's creepy. I mean, still can be enjoyable, but creepy.

But a situation, when soulmates are more like guidelines, not a requirement? It points you to a person, with which you have some kind of deep connection. You can be lovers. Best friends. Twins. Mentor and prot√®ge. Enemies but with a strange similarities and link. You have a potential to be the greatest together, but you can be also great with someone else. Especially, if there are markless people or finding out who your soulmate is is difficult.

So you can disagree with Fate's choice and still have a happy life, though you may feel like something is lacking? But you won't die from loneliness

** I like soulmate AU's where the main character pairing might end up together, but some background characters are soulmates but don't end up together romantically. I actually recently read a story with soulmates and, while the main characters ended up together, the world the writer created was such that the characters weren't forced to be romantically involved. A little detail the writer made was making one of the background characters soulmates who actually became best friends.

**** Yea, the whole soulmate trope is actually really interesting if written well. I mean, soulmates doesn't always have to mean sexual attraction. In real life we all have someone really close who isn't alway our partner.

For some people their soulmate could be their sibling, again non romantically!!! Or maybe a parent, or a best friend. To me that would make sense in a world where everyone has a soulmate. A soulmate is just someone you just easily connect with, more than anyone else.

the only versions i can stomach is

1. soulmates means fated to be someone important in youe life not necessarily romantic and you aren't sure what the relation is. Could be friends or like a guide/teacher for example. Doesn't even have to be positive like could be enemies.

2. your pet the only time I actually believe in love at first sight. Your pet is bonded to your life so they live as long as you ( aka like a dog living for like 80 years)

So their prey doesn't have much choice in finding them desirable I.e. Bella never even had a choice in liking Edward. And Edward never even had a choice in liking Bella because he basically describes her as the substance heroin because her blood was too addictive. How fucked up is that XD

** I agree. Especially when the enemies to lovers troupe is involved (although I also despise that on its own too). I much rather prefer when the soulmate au means that, out of everyone in the universe, those two would have souls that were most compatible.

But also, there's no actual destiny involved. They can just as easily hate eachothers guts and never see eachother again (going off to live their own satisfying lives with other people), as they can get married and live happily ever after with eachother.

It feels more satisfying when they build up the relationship naturally too.
