Got the idea from browsing the various HP fic summaries. Now I am looking for a fic where Harry is male in the beggining but willingly changes into a female. As in no being kidnapped and forced under a gender change ritual or sneakily fed a potion that causes him to be female. I mean a fic where Harry decided to be a female if only because of say, he got hit with a permanent, crippling curse that only works males or something.

If there isn't one I challenge writers to do one, just to see how they would go doing this.

Also I have read magical metamorphosis so a new fanfic is preferred

  Harry felt he had lost his chance at family after watching Sirius fly away only for his godfather to show up during the summer. Sirius teaches Harry what he needs to know, helping him become the true Lord Potter. Then the Tri-Wiz comes and the deepest, darkest secret of the Marauders is revealed - Harry was born the daughter of Lily and Sirius. Eventual Fem!HarryxTonks

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.
