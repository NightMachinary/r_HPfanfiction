Thinking steps ahead of the enemy, thinking of different alternatives to stop the bad guys, et cetra. I'm not looking for stories where Ron is super smart, but just where he uses his love and ability to play Wizarding Chess in a way that can help with real life problems/issues.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

ANYONE can be the main character.

It can be something minor or major in the story.

Can be on ANY site.

Would rather it be completed, but if not, that's fine

No: Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione. If Ron isn't bashed though, I'll allow it.

** ''Voldemort, I challange you to wizards chess'' Ron said standing up straight '' You dare challange me,' voldemort snarls 'Wizards chess, winner wins the war the loser surrenders' "your crazy if you think the dark lord would accept such a competition' bellatrix said smugly 'silence, belatrix , what rules are we playing with' voldemort asked 'my lord you can not be considering it' rookwood started saying before being killed. ' you decide the rules' ron stated

-Many hours later- Voldemort stared at the board in surprize he was losing and yet he was excited he had been challenged like this in years, this was what life was about Chess,''
