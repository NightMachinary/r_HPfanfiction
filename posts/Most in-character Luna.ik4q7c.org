Poor Luna - she seems to be a bit of a problem child in the fandom sometimes. She's always a seer, or chittering away about conspiracies. There are other aspects of her, like her weird brand of perceptiveness, lack of self-consciousness, secure self-confidence and a gentle lack of social awareness. Anyone have any Luna fics they feel really do the character justice, that fleshes her out a bit without removing those core parts of her? Thanks a lot üíñ

Also, has she always been treated this way by the fandom? Or has it just been that over time Seer!Luna has been popular and become a sort of standard in fic?

*** Working my way through these recs I completely agree! She has stroppy moments in the books and there are some whole fanfics where she doesn't get grumpy once. They're still fun to read but Luna had a lot of aspects to her that seems to be hard to capture huh.

** There are many non-Seer-Luna stories:

- surprisingly ‚ÄúThe Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel‚Äù linkao3(14078862) is Huna, and Luna is appropriately weird, but not overly so,
- linkffn(12407442) ... no signs of being a Seer at all,
- ‚ÄúProtection From Nargles by Arpad_Hrunta‚Äù linkao3(567400) and its sequel,
- ‚ÄúEternally Yours by Princess of Wands‚Äù linkffn(2086137) ... I am not sure I like it that much, but it is certainly worthy of reading.

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. Plot takes a while to appear but it's there) See last chapter for fan art and translations.

** I know you said you were specifically looking for a nonseer Luna, but since everyone's given you a bunch of recs already, I thought I'd throw my hat in the ring.

In the dangerverse series, Luna has seer powers, but they aren't the reason for her quirky nature, merely an... Extention of it. It's also not something made out to make her "oh so unique and special." In fact, it actually ends up being more of a curse, in a way. As in, it shows the realistic consequences of a young child having access to prophetic visions of her loved ones, directly before a World War.

And all the amazing qualities about her that you mentioned, her perception, her confidence and lack of self consciousness, and gentle lack of social cues - she has all of them. And both the good and the bad is shown. The characters love her /for/ her eccentricities, yes, but her love interest struggles especially with reconciling his normal teen urge for her to be "normal," with his admiration and respect for her total disregard for social values.

Most concequences of her weirdness is brushed off, due to the story being from the pov of Harry and Co, already a /very/ odd assortment of children, but it's still very much present in all its glory. Plus, she's part of the main cast for 90 something percent of the series, so you'll definitely get your craving met.

(her love interest is Draco, but before you panic it makes sense on context. The story is a massive timeline divergence starting from the time harry is 3ish, and as a result Draco had a very different upbringing and is a very different character.
