So.

I cannot read this pairing. It makes absolutely no sense why an eleven year old boy would get together with a girl six-seven years his senior. And even when Harry is older, Tonks has a stable job, and probably has met colleagues she has feelings for by that point in time. Why in the world would she want to date +a virgin+ a recent graduate of Hogwarts, who is most likely immature even if he is the "Chosen One."

Part of the reason I cannot read this pairing is because my mental image of Tonks is forever stuck as Dolores Umbridge +i hate this so much,+ but even without that I still cannot understand this ship.


** Eh, I can understand it when Harry is in his 20s...they get on well enough in the books and I think writers like to write a more "light hearted" Harry who enjoys pranks, etc. But yeah, barely graduated Harry with Tonks is bizarre and makes zero sense. If they're going to pair him with an "older" woman though Fleur makes far more sense as she's only 3 years older than him in canon. If anything, Fleur Harry makes more sense than Fleur Bill as Bill must be at least 8 or so years older than her. Not only he, but Charlie, had graduated by the time Ron started Hogwarts...so a newly graduated Fleur (17, 18 at the most) dating a 25-28 year old Bill is pretty yikes.

â€‹

That said, there are far, far more bizarre pairings....Harry/Snape, Hermione/Snape, Harry/Tom Riddle, etc.

*** Why would a 17 year old veela who's used to attention from any boy choose to look at a scrawny 14 year old, though? 17 year old girls tend to look for older guys, don't they? They want to date adults, not children

**** Well most fics have veela attracted to power so Harry has his fame, most often wealth, and very magically powerful. Hence why the Veela side of Fleur would be more attracted to Harry rather than Bill, while the Witch side of her would be more attracted to Bill.

**** True, in canon in Book 4 he still was a kid and she thought of him as a kid. 14 year old Harry is a stretch and pretty gross...I forgot he was only 14 and thought he was 15 in book 4. 15 and 17 isn't unheard of.

That said, if we're talking about an AU a 18 year old Harry does kind of make more sense with a 20/21 year old Fleur versus 20/21 year old Fleur with 28 year old (possibly older) Bill. Not that there's anything wrong with the latter, but I was 20 only a few years ago and I would find it kind of weird, but not that weird, of a friend dating an 18 year old but would find a friend dating a guy in his late 20s stranger.

TLDR: there's a big life gap between people 18-22 and people 25+.

** Really? You can't see a reality where a 21-22 year old Harry had a relationship with a 27-28 year old Tonks? I get why you would find the scenarios you described as unlikely but Tonks seems like one of the more reasonable and logical pairings for an older Harry.

*** The only plausible scenarios I can see that happening are:

(a) Semi-AU: Tonks never had a kid with Remus, Voldemort has already been defeated, and they are both working in the DMLE in possibly a senior/junior relationship.

(b) Complete AU

...yeah my mind is limited. But I would expect to see something along these lines for a well developed, in character, pairing between Harry and Tonks.

Well, compared to Lupin, her canonical husband, almost everyone short of Draco Malfoy and the like would have been a better choice. But it shows that she did not have an interest in her colleagues.

Because Tonks was one of the coolest background characters in the series (before book 6 at least), with a sense of humour, a mischievous streak and a unique look (only one in the series outside of "natural" hair colours). She did not come across as a haughty bitch, isn't a pureblood and frankly sounds most "date-able". Hermione would be difficult to get through to, Ginny comes with the baggage of her big family, Fleur is out of the league of mere mortals and Luna is batshit insane.

**** Hey in most states you can marry second cousins so legally for instance I could have married my grandmother's sister's grandaughter. Harry and Tonks are much greater removed than that if you prefer the canon Fleamont and Euphemia as Harry's grandparents. They are 2nd cousins if you prefer the fanon choice of Dorea and Charlus as Harry's grandparents.

And 6 years difference for magicals who can live to be over 100 is not that significant at all. Don't forget that women hit their sexual peak at 35-40 and men hit it at late teens early 20's. So the matchup isn't that strange. Add in Harry's fame, in fics wealth, and his normal treating women very well why wouldn't a slightly older woman be interested in him?

***** I meant that Sirius and Tonks are cousins. Harry and Tonks aren't related at all AFIAK, so that's not really an issue with the pairing.

I am, however, of the opinion that's it's morally wrong for a 20-something to be with a 15-16 year old. I'm 23 myself, and I could personally not see myself going for a school age boy in a million years, despite the age of consent being 15 here. Harry would of course think himself more mature than the average 15-year old, but there's an ocean of life experience between him and Tonks. Add in that she is an officer of the law, and you have a power imbalance as well.

What I'm saying is I don't see a relationship happening between them before Harry is 19, 20. Then I would agree that the age difference is less important.

****** Ok I can understand. As a guy I was almost out of college before I dated a girl who was my age or younger. Most of the women I went out with were 10+ years older than me. Now a big part of that was due to me working almost fulltime hours with adults from 13 years and up. In fact I got along better with adults than I did with kids my age. By the time I hit 16 between my size and how I carried myself/behaved most folks who met me thought i was in college or had just gotten out.

So I have little problem with a Tonks/Harry or Fleur/Harry ship. However, for it to work the fic has to have Harry acting a lot more mature than he does in canon. Otherwise with canon Harry it doesn't really work.

******* I think that in a relationship that is already equal, that's reasonable. Of course she shouldn't be prohibited from pursuing love because she's an auror. But as an auror, she is in a position of trust, of authority. I believe in some US states, for example, such a position changes the age of consent to 18.

This is of course a personal moral question, and I understand that people will disagree that her occupation affects the situation. It is my opinion that it, in combination with Harry's age, places them at vastly different power levels in a relationship.
