** Ron is hard. The fanfic reader in me wants to say a Sloth, but I don't think that's entirely fair. I can see him as a St Bernard dog in canon. I think that would also fit the way he goes looking for them in book 7.

Hermione's stereotypical answer would be an owl, but the idea of an otter or beaver appeals to me.

For Harry there are many directions you can go. Stag like his father, lion as a true Gryffindor, some kind of bird like a hawk or eagle because of his affinity for flying, wolf for a default "cool" animagus form. I once read a fic where he was a fox and for some reason I really liked that idea. As long as you stay away from the multiple magical animagus forms it's all good.

** I've once written Harry as a sparrow and it eternally sold me to the idea. A sparrow is unseen, quick in the air and strongest in the swarm. They are scrappers and survivors. Adaptable. Sparrows look out for their own and can get suprisingly fierce against predators much larger, much more dangerous than them. For the same reasons, and because they are cunning and smart creatures in addition, a crow would also work well.

For Hermione I envisioned underlining her viscious side with her animagus. The "animalistic" part of her personality can be violent and cruel, but she is never so without reason. Thats why I made her a wolf. Dangerous when angered and cornered, but generally trying to avoid a direct fight and outmaneuver her targets. Shy in a way that is not to be misunderstood with meek. Loyal to a fault. Ready to die for her pack, if that needs to be done.

For Ron I thought of many of the same points, but he definitely lacks the potential for great violence. He'll slap a bitch to the ground, thats right, but other than Hermione he is not the man to kick the downed enemy. So, wolf-like, but not as viscious as a wolf, Ron became a dog. A hound. Large and strong, but with a heart of gold. He became a [[http://www.vorply.com/media/1062/they-are-no-longer-used-to-hunt-bears-9.jpg][Caucasian Mountain Dog]], a breed famous for their cuddly fur, extremely large stature, and their use as a hunting dog for /bears/.

Wolves /do/ avoid conflict, unless you threaten or tread something or somewhere they consider theirs.

As I wrote:

Also foxes are cowards and roam around mostly alone. Hermione is neither of those things. She is brave, and stands her ground. She seeks connections, even if she is very clumsy and awkward about it at start, with it taking years to get better.

The interpretation of characters and animals is everyone's creative privilege. I personally think I chose well with the wolf.

Imprisoning Rita Skeeter in her beetle form, for example.

Harry just strikes you out of his life and ignores you as good as possible. Ron has a lot of bark, but doesn't truly bite quickly. Hermione is, in my mind, the one who who is most capable of great violence /if necessary/.

She is not aggressive. That would mean that she's actively trying for violence. But what I find is that Hermione has the least regard for the well being of the people she sees as enemies.

******* My only rebuttal to this would be that Harry is the only one out of the three able to cast an unforgivable. He's also the only one who did kill someone (Voldemort and Quirel), seriously wounds someone (Draco, Bella), and tries to wound someone (Snape).

Hermione is coldly calculating and can be ruthless, no doubt. But she doesn't generally run hot in terms of revenge or action (bar punching Draco once). No she plans her revenge. Which o guess is more dangerous in some ways, but makes me think of a bird or small predator more (owl or fox). It's some one who can hang back and wait for revenge and stop herself. She's strategic. She also tends to work alone too on important stuff. Time turner, polyjuice, basilisk research, protean coins, contract for DA, etc. She relies on herself most and is the most independent.

I see Harry as the one that when push comes to shove that can actually do the job himself and go after someone. He's the alpha of the group and realistically the only one with proper teeth in a fight. But Harry relies on people more too. Examples are endless.

******** If you're talking cold, calculated kills - strategic movement - I'm back at wolves again. Movies and myth have painted a very wrong picture of wolves. They're not stupidly attacking. They circle their prey, make assessments and then strike once they see an opportune moment.

Harry never actually plans on going after somebody, with the exception of his arch nemesis, of course. He does all these things in the spur of the moment, with his blood boiling.

Hermione is very clear in her intentions. There is a large difference in personality between somebody who acts ruthless by reflex in stressful situations, and somebody who does it calculated and planned.

And most of what you showed of her doing it alone was, in the end, for "the pack". The Time Turner is the exception. Hermione may not rely on Harry and Ron to do her homework, but she relies on them much more as friends. Yes, she doesn't need help, but she very much needs her "pack".

Anyway, this is getting a bit tedious now. Whatever the respective author thinks fits...

** I'd think Harry would have started learning how to transform before he understood his connection to Voldemort, and would have been drawn to the form of a snake. Something small and fast, that wouldn't look for a fight but could defend itself HARD when called to.

I see Ron as a bear. Something that would scratch its back adorably against a tree and love to chow down on a great big pumpkin---but which is also capable of mauling a threat with one swipe. I think the size and strength would especially appeal to him as a sixth brother whose best friend is famous. But while he likes being a Quidditch king, he is ultimately humble, so I don't think he'd pick something flashy like “tiger.”

Hermione's choice would be practical to a fault. I'm thinking a crow. Something that flies, because she isn't comfortable on a broom but sometimes flying is handy. Corvids are intelligent, so that would appeal to her. And crows are ubiquitous; no one would question why there is a crow hanging out on this fence here or that lamp post there.

** It would be a pretty pointless animagus, but I kinda see Harry as a salmon. They are tenacious survivors, going thousands of miles against the current, swimming upstream, over the rocks and rapids.

Hermione... probably a lynx or a bobcat. A fierce, strong and resourceful, sometimes vicious animagus that also shows her affinity to cats.

Ron would be a dog or maybe some kind of a monkey or ape, like [[https://www.google.com/search?q=Golden+lion+tamarin&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjd5IXRrbHgAhXSwosKHQvJCwoQ_AUIDigB&biw=1440&bih=758][Golden Lion Tamarin]], for example.

** its hard not to have Hermione be a cat after her 2nd year accident combined with having a fondness for them(crookshanks) also i think we can assume Professor McGonagall is her fav teacher so maybe she is inspired by her and she is also a Gryffindor so Lions and all that symbolism comes in as well.

Harry...it might be a bit too lazy to make him a stag like his dad....so maybe I'd make Harry an owl based on his love of flying and probably wanting wings and Hedwig was his first real friend(aside from Hagrid) he might become an owl in tribute to her.

Ron....tricky i think he is quite crafty at times so maybe a fox, they can be cheeky animals like Ron and sneak into your garden and make off with anything you've left laying around out there also the red fur suits his red hair haha

** I think Harry would've been either a stag or a maned wolf. I like the latter idea because the maned wolf has been described as a “wolf with deer legs” before, which is a good nod to James, Sirius, and Remus and their impacts on Harry. Also, I've never seen anybody write Harry as a maned wolf animagus, so it's an outside-of-the-box idea.

As for Hermione and Ron, I don't really have a preference with them, although I am rather partial to Hermione being a Scottish wildcat animagus. But as long as it makes sense for their characters (whether in the books or in fanfiction), I don't really care either way.

I like the Sparrow idea mentioned.

For Ron, I agree with others about a dog. Perhaps an Irish setter just because we've gotta be unoriginal with the hair color :)

Ron's patronus is a Jack Russel, if that means anything.

Hermione is tricky for me. Intellectually, I think she'd appreciate being something that is easily used to spy like Skeeter's beetle. It seems like so often, people's animagus match their patronus, which means Hermione should be an otter.

It also means my other guesses are kind of moot.

When Hermione (also in Ravenclaw) undergoes the ritual, she gets a tigress as her form (allowing her to use a tiger plushie to prank her annoying cousin) while Ravenclaw!Neville gets an Orang-utan form which is very useful for Herbology.

Ron is still in Gryffindor and doesn't get an animal form in-story, although his sister becomes pen-pals with Hermione and once she gets into Ravenclaw, goes through the ritual that lets her become a Honey Bear while her friend Luna becomes a Red-Headed Crane.

** While wolves are probably just default "cool" animagus forms, I think there is some canon basis for Harry having a wolf-like animagus form, given that both of the men closest with his parents are associated with wolves/canines. However, from mythological standpoint, wolves are often associated with calamity and are probably not an especially "heroic" choice for the protagonist. Given Harry's love of flying, and especially chasing down and catching a snitch, it's also pretty easy to associate him with raptor birds, which might be why falcons and eagles are often obvious choices in fics. Still, I personally prefer the idea that Harry's animagus form would be a wolf or maybe a dog--preferably a breed known for being independent and mischievous, like a Shiba--to a bird, because it sort of implies a bond with Sirius and/or Remus that we don't really get to see enough of in canon.

Hermione has a few associations with cats, stretching back to the Polyjuice incident in CoS, the fact that her magical familiar is a cat, and the (possibly fanon) idea that she is McGonagall's favorite student and vice-versa. Cats are also curious, intelligent, and have inborn violent predator instincts that can appear downright sociopathic, all of which can apply to Hermione at her most devious. If you're going for rule of cool, you can make her a wildcat of some kind, like a lynx or an ocelot, but I think a housecat works just as well.

I think other comments here about Ron are pretty much spot on about large dogs. But for a more out-there suggestion, possibly a horse, given that both he and Harry are associated with knights: Ron with taking the knight's place in the chess game, and Harry quite literally pulling a Saint George and going to a "dragon's lair" to kill a large serpent with a sword and save the princess in CoS. In chess, the "knight" piece usually isn't the knight but is rather his horse, and in CoS, Ron accompanies Harry down below but is unable to join him in fighting the basilisk, which makes something of a dependable traveling companion, but not a battle compatriot, when we relate it back to knightly mythology. Given this, Ron /could/ be seen as Harry's trusty horse, which is kind of insulting when you think about it, but is also a cool basis for an animagus form.
