I'm interested in reading good stories featuring Hermione after the war, for instance, dealing with the after-effects of having been captured and tortured at Malfoy Manor, and finding some resolution with her parents. Linkffn(Australia by MsBinns) is a good one, though I tend to think of that story as being more Ron-centric. Would appreciate any recs. Thanks!


** How Hermione made it to the Minister is great fanfic material.

There are thousands of angst/comfort/fluff/hurt/smut fics about postwar H/G, but very little has been written about R/Hr, and almost nothing about Hermione's professional career.

[[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Author-22082/DianeCastle.htm][DianeCastle]], author of [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]], will be writing a new story called /Hermione Granger and the Swiss Tournament/, but it is set in that non-magic AU.

*** Yes, that's such a pity.

DianeCastle's work is on my to-read list, though I've shied away because I feel kind of leery at the thought of the series being a multi-fandom crossover. Will keep this upcoming work on my radar. Thanks!

** linkffn(Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation by Vera Rozalsky)

linkffn(The Golden Age by Arsinoe de Blassenville) is a rather cynical take.

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

  Things are not easy for Ron and Hermione right after the Battle of Hogwarts. They need each other badly, but forced and rash decisions bring them apart. This story is a different take on the Summer following the end of the war. It begins moments before Deathly Hallows ends and continues over the following months. WARNING: Read the Author's Notes!
