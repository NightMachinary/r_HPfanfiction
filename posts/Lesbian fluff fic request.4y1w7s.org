I just remembered that Crazy Little Things by Dreiser exists and was wondering if people could toss in more FemSlash fluff, preferably at least a few thousand words..


** [[http://fem-exchange.livejournal.com/9914.html][Matching-Muff Matrimony]] is the first Ginny/Pansy I've read. I found it quite funny, and enjoyed it immensely.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4579602/1/][Girl's Own Adventure]] is Ginny/Luna. Quite imaginative, and very Luna-esqe.

*** Too bad I didn't come up with anything in particular... Sad day. I'll keep the concept going though, since it wouldn't take much to integrate it into my regular series.
