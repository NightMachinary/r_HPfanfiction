I found a fanfiction that seemed interesting, and when it reached the first year train section, Hermione's eyes were not described as chocolate brown. It sounds really stupid and too small to make an entire post for, but I haven't ever seen 'eyes the colour of whiskey' before, and it just made me really happy.


** Whenever i see something like this, I always think of an old Monkees episode where a man describes a woman's eyes as looking like, “cupcakes, floating in a sea of sour cream.”

As for whiskey-colored eyes, I have seen whiskey-colored eyes and they were gorgeous. One of my good friends in high school had the most amazing, green/gold/hazel eyes and I was always so jealous. Mine are just brown brown brown without even any interesting bits. One could even say they're chocolate brown. Would I myself describe them as such? No because it's ridiculous, but I can see where another character who is especially interested in Hermione and wishes to ascribe some sort of desirable quality to her eyes might describe them as such.

*** That's... a sure way to endear a lady to you. Liken her eyes to the most unappetizing mix of edibles you can find! This is genuinely hilarious, it made me look up that show.

** Definitely an improvement over how Stephen King described the people of Tull in The Gunslinger: “Their faces seemed to swim above their all-but-invisible bodies like pallid balls with eyes”. Makes me picture ping-pong balls.

*** That description fits well in the context of the book, which is often eerie and darkly fantastical.

** I'm still hung up on the use of "orbs" with years of fanfiction reading under my belt.

Whiskey, though original, is a bit unusual as a colour comparison for a 11 year old - especially when amber is literally almost exactly the same.

But isn't Hermione's eye colour dark brown in canon? Not much of a yellow hue to that.

** When characters' eyes are described as "chocolate orbs", I immediately think of those Lindor truffles instead of eyes.

"Whiskey" is a pretty common eye color description in the more flowery romance fics, btw. If you read enough of them, you'll get sick of it by the tenth time you see the phrase, "Whiskey brown met emerald green" instead of just saying, "Hermione glanced at Harry".

** Eyes the color of whiskey?

Look, I'm all for show over tell, but it has to be appropriate. Staring into the eyes of your partner as you get married is one thing, meeting some random kid on the first day of school is different. Also, describing someone's appearance in relation to alcohol can have some negative connotations for a lot of characters.

*** It also makes little sense for a first-year to be so familiar with whiskey as to describe eyes in its color.

** Lagavulin, Jameson, Hibiki,... ?

That description is horribly inaccurate. With chocolate you can at least narrow it down a bit.

** I have never seen the color of whiskey before, so I wouldn't ever use that description.
