:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There's a specific fic that I'm looking for. It's a Harry Potter/Avengers crossover.

At some part of that fic Harry ends up in the vaults Of Asgard and ends up bonding with or claiming a magical staff that was once wielded by a god. The staff contains the soul of said god. I think it was an Egyptian god of death but I'm not sure. This part I may be mixing up with another fic as I went through a phase and read a bunch but I'm pretty sure Harry also used magic to fix the bifrost.

If anyone has any ideas thank you.

  The infinity stones have a far greater power than anyone knew with their existence being far greater. Death is normally not one to intervene but when she sees what could be the end of existence she knows she has to interfere. Eventually leading to what one universe calls the Master of Death the new Universe will know as an Avenger. Hopefully he will have what it takes.
