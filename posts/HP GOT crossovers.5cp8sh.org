I would like to read some crossover between Harry Potter and game of thrones. I have already read The Black Prince.

Any kind of crossover will do, Harry can be extremely powerful, a prince or be in place of fat-lips.


** This is my favorite HP/GOT crossover: linkffn(11132113)

The Difference One Man Can Make plays years before the actual series begins. Harry is flung through some dimension-timey-wimey-stuff into the world of GOT. He ends up beyond the wall where he begins to build a society out of the tribes and hordes of Wildlings he encounters.

This new society shakes Westeros and Essos up and the story explores this difference that one wizard beyond the wall makes.

Also weirdly satisfying to read is this one: linkffn(11904771)

However, don't take this one too serious. Its very "anime" in its plotting and storytelling, but one of the few exception where that isn't a death sentence for the fic.

  My reward for beating the Demon Emperor and sending him back to hell? Finding myself in an unknown land, hounded by heralds of ice and fire, as well as the idiotic peoples of the lands in this... Westeros. Is it possible to find a way home? I don't know. Eventual Harry/Daenerys.

*** Difference is definitely one of my favourite crossovers, especially because of the depth that goes into building a society and because of the ideas that are shown for a wizard in a wizardless world (excluding the basic magic in GoT).

** My favorite HP/GOT crossover is linkffn(The Witch Queen of Essos by TheGirlWithFarTooManyIdeas) It explores the possibility that the veil is a portal to Westeros as opposed to the Other Side one reaches after death. Ginny's family is killed and she tries to follow them by stepping through the veil. Instead she finds herself in Westeros and is soon reunited with Sirius Black in Pentos in Essos... Follows Ginny and what impact her magic can have in the world of A Song of Ice and Fire.

** linkffn(11388514) The Last Lion of House Reyne makes Harry one of the last members of House Reyne just before Tywin Lannister eradicates the house during the Reyne-Tarbeck Rebellion. The main character is Harry but slowly lives through Harry Potter's memories and has the same magical powers.

** linkffn(The Wizard of Harrenhal by DisobedienceWriter) I really like this authors stuff and this was an interesting read, if you don't mind a very AU story.

*** I really like The Wizard of Harrenhal. Harry's character is dramatically overpowered, and thus the story should be boring, and yet DisobedienceWriter manages to pull it off. Yet more evidence for my thesis that if you're a good enough writer, you can break more or less any rule and still have a successful result.

**** Yeah, I agree. Harry was totally OP in that story, and it served his character well and added to his mystery. I love that it's written omniscient style, feels like the way GoT felt- your an outsider watching history unfold, you get a feeling of how rumours flow and add to the legend. Having a narrator made Harry's super power seem less clich√© because of third person detachment, so it felt more like I was reading a fairy tale, and that it had a purpose in adding more to the legend he was becoming. But he really was sickeningly OP. Westeros never had a chance.

  The Master of Death, Harry Potter, wakes one cold spring morning in Westeros. He has no idea why he's there - or how he'll get back. Harry always had bad luck, but a lot of persistence. He'll need it. Winter is Coming.
