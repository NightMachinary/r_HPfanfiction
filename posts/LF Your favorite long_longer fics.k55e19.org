Hi again! I started reading "All the Young Dudes" on AO3, and it sorta reignited my interest in fics. I'm buddy reading with a friend, though, so I'm taking other non-oneshot suggestions!

I ultimately prefer a sense of canon compliance, but I'll read divergence as long as it generally sticks to the fantasy aspect of HP. No preference on ships (so long as it isn't teacher/student) or era. And I'd love more worldbuilding if possible! Thank you all. <33


** I love [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15465966/chapters/35902410][The Second String]], Harry is sent to the past in another dimension after the Dementor attack in OotP.

WIP, almost at the end. There will be one last chapter and an epilogue. The romance is between Harry and Gideon, but is not the focus of the story and doesn't begin until the third part, I think.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

** face death in the hope by LullabyKnell

268148 words and 59 chapters so far. Time Travel fic. Not very fast moving or action oriented. Regulus/Harry but it is slow burn and on the side lines because the fanfic is not focused on romance.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366/chapters/13756558]])

Rose Petal Red by NonchalantxFish

521566 words and 64 Chapters so far. Currently on Hiatus. Self Insert Story. Guinevere is kind of overpowered but it is well done imo. I primarily enjoy this one because the family aspect is just wholesome.

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

** Alright, here's what I have:

[Title & Link] by [Author]\\
[Word Count], [Updating Status], [Genre], [POV], [Ship], [Setting].

Settings:

- Alternate Universe; there are things that are different from canon that cannot be easily explained.
- Canon Divergence; the same as canon up until the mentioned point.
- Isekai; one or more characters are sent as themselves to another world or time.
- Peggy Sue; similar to Isekai, but instead their memories are sent to their younger self.
- Post-Canon; a fic that takes place after the events of the main seven books, EWE means it ignores DH's epilogue.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  A mentor fic: When Snape discovers Harry is abused by the Dursley's, he is forced to teach Harry for the summer after the tri-wizard tournament. Will they eventually find the family they never had? No slash and Harry will never be Snape's biological son.

** It just so happens that I made a list of my favorite fics the other day that seem to fit your requirements. Most of them tend towards NextGen fics as that is what I seem to prefer as they don't need to dance around canon as much. Note that some of these fics that seem "shorter" (20-30 chapters) are actually the first installment in a series so there is more to read. Enjoy!
