*** I've read Divided and Entwined, Dumbledore's Next Great Adventure, and A Dramatic Reading.

Dumbledore's Next Great Adventure is probably one of my most loved stories of all time. Great writing, great plot. Past Wulfric, there's few cliches. The good!Dumbledore in this story is an amazing person, and extremely refreshing to read in comparison to many of the bad Dumbledores floating around.

Starfox5 is a great writer, but his plots, characterizations, and the droning nature of his writing, makes me hesitate to say that Divided and Entwined is a great story. The only story of his I really liked was The Dark Lord Never Died, partially because of its more fluid writing and faster pace. It's certainly a quality read, but I'd recommend other Harry/Hermione AU stories before it.

A Dramatic Reading is fucking hilarious. IIRC Umbridge did not have a good time by the end of the story.

He wanted to help her, prove he was a good friend, be there for her, but... she wouldn't let him, not much. She had become rather closed-off, lately. Moodier than Harry, even. And she spent more time with the other muggleborns than with Ron and Harry. He didn't like that, even though he understood that she needed to.

Also, the Docklands bomb in 1996 contained Semtex. [[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/03/police-question-two-men-after-6kg-of-semtex-discovered-in-dublin][Further, they recently discovered even more Semtex in North Ireland.]]

Provisional Irish Republican Army arms importation into the Republic of Ireland for use in Northern Ireland began in the early 1970s. With these weapons it conducted an armed campaign against the British state in Northern Ireland.

**** The IRA isn't called "heroes" or anything in the story. I simply assumed that the IRA would be the easiest source of plastic explosives for a group of British and Irish students to get into contact. Matter of fact, Seamus's tale does hint at the fact that he might have been shot, had the meeting with them gone wrong, and that it was above all a business transaction - they were well-paid to provide a miniscule sample of Semtex and a detonator.

Also, Seamus didn't rock to Belfast - he used his extended family to get into contact with a guy who knew a guy, so to speak.

****** I just searched my work - the only time "Freedom fighter" is used is in this paragraph, and Hermione is talking about herself:

#+begin_quote
  The others nodded. They hadn't heard anything from their friend. It had been deemed too dangerous for him to call back. His contacts in Ireland might be under surveillance by the muggle authorities. If the Resistance lost the muggle world as a safe haven, they were finished. If Seamus succeeded though... everyone knew that the IRA was among the most capable guerilla fighters - or terrorists, depending who you asked. A little bit of Semtex would be enough for a Gemino Charm, and Hermione wouldn't have to think about how best to use a fertilizer bomb any more. And she really would prefer to use professionally made detonators, instead of her own designs.

  Getting blown to bits by her own bomb would be a rather ignoble end to her burgeoning career as a freedom fighter.
#+end_quote

Also, Seamus is very unlikely to have had family killed by the IRA, seeing as he is from Ireland (hence, "contacts in Ireland"), and not from Ulster (at least any family killed after the Irish civil war).

I assume that the IRA would easily sell a gram of Semtex if they were paid with enough gold. That won't really hinder their own operations at all.

Yes, the IRA are called "guerilla fighters" - which is a rather neutral term, focusing on the tactics used.

Finally, the IRA (or splinter groups) were still active in 1995.

******** Seamus has family, you know. And the IRA has been backed politically by Sinn Fein - which is active in both Ulster and Ireland. Assuming that Seamus has (extended) family who in turn know someone with connections to the IRA isn't exactly absurd. The IRA had supporters and sympathisers; it didn't exist isolated from everyone else. Hell, a number of the Irish-Americans supported them financially in the 70s.

It also isn't absurd to assume that the IRA - especially when they are, as you said, about to stop the war - would sell minimal amounts of explosive - far from enough to make a bomb - if paid enough.

And if you actually think they'd care that it's a kid then you're even more naive. Money talks, to terrorists and to everyone else. And if a war's ending, then many people are starting to look out for themselves, too.

#+begin_quote
  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.
