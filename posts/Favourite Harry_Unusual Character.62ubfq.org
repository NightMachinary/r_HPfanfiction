** Delenda Est, for once. Harry x Bella Black.

Grow Young With me. Harry x muggle OC. I've seen many people here recommend this story and I couldn't agree more.

Hocus Pocus Adele Polkiss, Harry x muggle OC.

Anything from James Spookie's collection that you see fit. He writes a lot of Harry x Daphne stories, there's also a couple of Harry x Susan.

Or follow [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/61p85b/request_saw_harry_x_katie_mentioned_a_few_times/][this link]] for some Harry x Katie stories.

I mean, they qualify as Harry/Unusual character, but the quality tends to run from dreadful to mostly readable. The later you go in terms of publishing date, the higher the quality tends to get.

**** Ah yeah, I have to concede this point. It's true that his later works are much less repetitive than the earlier ones. Shame that the latest ones aren't completed, and they tend to take awhile to be updated.

They make do if you just want nice fluff without anything too extreme though.

  After his adventure in the Department of Mysteries, Harry finds a new power over air which gives him confidence. He's "live and let live" until you come after him, then watch out. This starts just after the revelation of the prophecy at the end of book5.

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

  "Haven't you wondered if there's more to the world then a backwards, prejudiced society?" When Harry asks Astoria Greengrass this question in a fit of temper after he's forced to compete in the tournament, he wasn't expecting her answer - or that he'd go along with her decision to run away with him and see the world. Can two different people find happiness? HarryxAstoria

  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.

  COMPLETE. James Potter casts his own spell to protect his only son; but he was never as good with Charms as Lily was. (A more ruthless Harry Potter grows up to confront Voldemort). Dark!Harry. Slytherin!Harry HP/HG and then HP/HG/TN.
