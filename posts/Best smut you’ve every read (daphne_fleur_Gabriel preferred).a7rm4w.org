** I did a search for this specific combo and it is the first time I've ever seen A03 stumped for smut. There is some incest in HP fanfic, but not this particular combo. And now I am aware of Arthur/Ginny fics and must go scrub out my eyes, so goodbye.

**** The worst thing I've ever seen was an explicit rated fic for Harry/Lily Luna, where, judging by the tags, she was probably a toddler.

Like holy fuck! I have successfully forgotten most of it, but I'm pretty sure one of the tags for it was "extreme underage".

Normally I have a strong stomach for that kind of thing and even sometimes check out stories with stupid incest pairings to see how bad things really are and have a laugh and the rediculousness of it, but for that story just reading the description was already way too much.

It's the only time browsing for fanfics that I ever immidiatly went back to the top, excluded a new tag from my search and reloaded the page just to get a fic out of my sight as quickly as possible.

****** Please stop. I'm horrified. I respect people's right to read what they want, even if it's something I personally disagree with or think is weird, but there are /some/ lines.

This is why virtually all the reading I do on ao3 comes from recs from this subreddit.

** That would depend on one's own kinks as much as the actual quality of the fic. Also most of the smut I like comes from actual porn sites, so I can't link it.

Have this one as something I enjoyed a lot: linkffn(bibliophile)

And this one as something with Fleur and Gabrielle: linkao3(harry potter and the veela sisters)

  Harry, still coming to terms with the reality of his destiny, and only just beginning to understand his greatest foe finds himself the unintended recipient of a magical bond between himself and one Gabrielle Delacour. An epic AU story beginning in the middle of sixth year, follows harry as one dramatic event leads him down a spiral path of debauchery and discovery.
