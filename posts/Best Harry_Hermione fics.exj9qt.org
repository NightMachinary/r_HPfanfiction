I've always been partial to this ship but I've never actively sought it out before, as I tend to prefer either gen fics or slash/femslash fics over het ones. But I've decided I want to try reading some Harry/Hermione fics now, so if any of y'all would be willing to rec me your favorite ones, that would be great. I'm specifically looking for fics that are long (at the very least 60k words), well written, and take place during the trio's Hogwarts years. There also can't be any graphic sexual scenes. I can deal with a few vague scenes of that nature if the fic takes place in like 7th year or something, but nothing else.


** Hope you enjoy them. Some are not as long as you want but they are good.

** You should also post it on [[/r/HPharmony][r/HPharmony]] to get more responses. Answer a few questions and I will post fics that fit your reply.

Do you want romance to be a focus? Is it okay if it is not the focus?

Are there any tropes that you absolutely do not want?

What genre are you looking for exactly?

What about bashing?

What about WIP fics?

*** Oh, thanks! I didn't even know that existed. As for your questions:

1. I prefer romance to not be the focus, actually, but I can deal with it if it is.
2. No Evil!Harry/Hermione, no ‚ÄúVoldemort Wins‚Äù AUs, no non-magic AUs, and no ‚Äúnot like other girls‚Äù tropes, and no sad endings, I can't stand those.
3. Fantasy/Adventure. Basically anything but sci-fi or straight up comedy.
4. Preferably not, but if the plot is good enough I can deal with it.
5. WIPs are fine as long as they aren't abandoned.

** Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire: [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700]]

Pretty much my unreserved req for this pairing. Hermione magically messed with things that results in her name coming out of the goblet. Feels very cannonish.

I also enjoyed Escape ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11916243/1/]]), YMMV though. I know some of the tropes in it can turn people off.

For a background H/Hr relationship I would req Stages of Hope (where H/Hr are ambigiously together in misery due to their loves dying in the war And they are broken), and A little child shall lead them (Where H/Hr relationship is a motivation for Hermione, but is not seen in the fic itself. Also best closing line.)

** Honestly, I've yet to find a Harmony fic that I can wholeheartedly recommend, even though I don't mind the pairing in theory. I do think that with their canon personalities, Harry/Ginny makes more sense, though.

I'll take a look at some of those links and see what I can see.

*** We barely see Ginny's personality. She lacks presence in the series. The romance would be better if Rowling established her character early. It just felt shoehorned. Using the monster in his chest as a catalyst for the romance is not very inspiring. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
