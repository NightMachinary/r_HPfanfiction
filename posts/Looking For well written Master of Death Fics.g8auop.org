Hey friends,

I'm looking for a good Master of Death story to read on breaks and stuff. No slash, SI, or crack fics, but other than that, I'm open to reading some good fics. Much appreciated and stay safe,

** If you're into crossovers, I recommend reading Shadow of Angmar by Steelbadger (LOTRxHP) and Prometheus Bound by AnarchicMuse (MarvelxHP). Although AnarchicMuse says he's open to slash, it hasn't happened yet.

** Take a look at this list [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/fapnkx/master_of_deathharry_excel_collection_help/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share]]

It's a collection of MoD fics and it tells you about the pairings, if it's finished abandoned or a wip. Summary of the story etc

** My Elder Tales trilogy is all about the Deathly Hallows, in particular about how the Elder Wand affects Harry. The final fic in it is completely finished and I'm publishing two chapters every week.
