It's 1981 and you have just been handed baby Harry to take care of, being the better alternative to the Dursleys. How do you raise and prepare Harry for the trials he is to face at Hogwarts?


** I'm no squib, I'm a seer with a prophecy about Percy's pet rat.

Let Sirius deal with a toddler's accidental magic.

*** I would also worry about NATO maneuver [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Able_Archer_83][Able Archer 83]] getting out of control in this new timeline. It was supposed to be a really close call in ours. The Wizards need to make sure those crazy Muggles don't go overboard!

** ...come clean to Dumbledore and let him solve literally every problem present within the original timeline with the help of his newfound knowledge, God-like magical skill, and awesome political power. Then ask him for money, protection, and various favors to be called-in in the future, so that I can live my life in peace and personal fulfillment. I mean, Dumbledore is a pretty kind, understanding kinda guy, and I've just saved countless lives and made his job /a lot/ easier in the process --- I doubt he would refuse, especially if I'm not a dick about it.

For the long-term goals... I guess that would be trying to manage large-scale research of Magic with the help of Muggle scientists and Wizard magical theorists, preferably without getting in trouble for breaching the Statute of Secrecy (though I would be trying to slowly, diplomatically bring that awful piece of crap down, too). Then would come charity and effective altruism work, using Magic to solve world hunger, build roads and infrastructure with Transfiguration, Apparate medicine, food, and relief to regions wrecked by natural disasters and war, try to cure cancer and stuff, create longevity solutions, and so on. I mean, I might be a squib, but there are plenty of wizards capable and willing to do that kind of work --- all I would need to do is /give them the choice/ and then supervise their work to make sure they don't do something stupid.

As for Harry Potter, not my problem. Sirius can have him.

** Lily's siblings would be Muggles if they didn't have magic, because Lily's parents were Muggles. James would have a squib sibling, however.

** Gives Harry the happy childhood he was supposed to have and act all surprised when he receives his letter? I mean, it's not like a Squib (or a Muggle) could truly prepare a todler to face a freaking Dark Lord with a 50 years head start. And it's not like "preparing" him would be a good idea, Canon Harry is a child surprisingly well adjusted considering his upbriging, though fanfics tend to make the Dursley worse than what they were, a 11 years old child that act like Moody because he had been "prepared" is not adjusted /at all/.

If you keep the canon knowledge, and it's possible to contact Dumbledore, I would propably send him a letter to speed up the process. If it's not possible, just wait for Harry 1st year to contact him just before he goes to school. Totally suck for Sirius, but with the exception of him, it's not like any of the Horcruxe is an urgent problem which can't wait some years to be dealt with.

** 1. In a year or two, find a way to alert the authorities about Pettigrew in a way that Sirius knows it was me
2. Guilt trip Sirius into giving me unrestricted access to the Black library
3. Find an ancient ritual to turn a squib into a wizard
4. Do the ritual and make a horcrux
5. Fuck off from Britain before the second blood war starts
6. ???
7. Sell as lakefront property

** I would contact Fank/Alice Longbottom (somehow), warn them about the upcoming attack. As a thank you, I'd let them raise Harry. Let them deal with the accidental magic. I'm not getting anywhere near that mess.
