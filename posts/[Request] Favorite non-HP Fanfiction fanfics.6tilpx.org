It's been a while since this has been asked--what are your favorite fanfics for other fandoms, besides Harry Potter?


** Besides this subreddit, I think the best fanfic sub (and in my opinion, best community) has to be [[https://www.reddit.com/r/WormFanfic/][Worm Fanfiction]]. Based on a masterpiece of a web serial (Worm), it revolves around a fascinating, tightly woven world of superpowers. Though it has its own share of tropes and bad fics, there are more than a few top tier pieces of writing. I can't recommend it enough for anyone interested in a treasure trove of fanfics. Additionally, I'd recommend the canon story as something I'm still in love with, even years after the initial hype has worn off (so that's something people might be interested in).

*** Same for me! Worm's thriving fanfiction community probably has a lot to do, at least in part, with the incredibly extensive worldbuilding, characters, and plot elements in the canon story. Somewhat similar reason to HP, I expect!

** - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5398503/1/Embers][Embers]], an incredible AU rewrite of the later seasons of the show Avatar: The Last Airbender. This is one of my favorite pieces of fiction, full stop. Excellent worldbuilding, convincing and realistic original characters, and a brilliant story. 9.5/10.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3271761/1/Fallen][Fallen]], a rewrite of the Protector of the Small Quartet in which Kel is kicked out of page training.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7354757/1/The-Game-of-Champions][The Game of Champions]], a dark and gritty take on the classic Kanto Pokemon story.

Star Wars:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2212346/1/Drive-You-Mild][Drive You Mild]], an AU Star Wars fic featuring a romance between Emperor Luke Skywalker and Jedi Knight Mara Jade.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4302076/1/Into-the-Storm][Into the Storm]] and sequels, which diverge from the Empire Strikes Back. Fantastic plot and great original characters.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/8426782/chapters/19308361][The Ice of Angels' Tears]], where the royal families of Naboo have concealed Force talents for generations. Upon her death on Polis Massa, Padme Amidala is sent back to her childhood to live again.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/480208][The Jedi Shmi AU]], an awesome series where Anakin's mother frees herself and comes along to the Temple. Amazingly written. You should read it.

Naruto:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11403659/1/Stumble][Stumble]]. Sakura and Sasori find themselves together in limbo (post Fourth War), and then get reborn into their younger bodies. Deals realistically with mental trauma and other stuff - a fantastic story, but not for the faint of heart.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9255749/1/D%C3%A9j%C3%A0-vu-no-Jutsu][Deja vu no Jutsu]], an excellent self-insert in Minato's generation.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9976299/1/Fireborn][Fireborn]], an AU featuring an OC around Kakashi's age.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5328489/1/RED][RED]], which is an incredibly unique fanfic. It's sort of a crossover with The Book Thief, in which Konoha is reminiscent of 1930's Germany, with the Uchiha as the repressed and distrusted minority. Very, very dark at times, and somewhat surreal, but one of the best fanfics I've found anywhere.

**** Yeah, Embers is pretty severely AU. I really like it because I find Vathara's worldbuilding to be vastly more internally consistent (and interesting!) than what's presented in the show, and I love conflict motivated by cultural misunderstandings. But I can definitely see why a lot of people don't like it.

You might enjoy [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6026583/1/The-Legacy-of-the-Headband][The Legacy of the Headband]] (sadly incomplete) which follows the kids in the Fire Nation school through Aang's visit as Kuzon and a little after. Writing quality is a little meh, which is why I didn't include it in my previous post, but it's still an interesting story.

***** I can see /why/ you like Embers--I've heard nothing but good things about the consistency of the world building. And you're not wrong about how the original series holds up--I didn't like Legend of Korra very much, and I do not like the trilogy comics at all (especially /The Rift/ which robs Toph's backstory of all its nuance). I didn't even bother to read the fourth and fifth collections.

Personally, I think the franchise suffered greatly when Aaron Ehasz didn't return.

So, ironically, there's actually quite a bit of fanfic that is better than what we got for Avatar.

Take this one: "See Behind the Mask" has Toph go on a life-changing field trip with Iroh. And it is awesome.

** I'm a big fan of Type-Moon, so basically any of the good/popular fics from there, the crossovers (except the popular Harry Potter ones, which are pretty bad, bar that one where Shirou goes to Hogwarts with Fem!Harry that was pretty good but never got far). In that vein, most of the popular ZnT fics/crossovers are really appealing. Recently reread Fate/Revelation Online, just recently read Path of the King (some very noticeable errors at first, but creative and gets better but not completely fixed once you get to the beta'd chapters)

Prytaneum, by the author of The Games We Play (a very popular Jaune-centric RWBY fanfic, also great) is a Percy Jackson/Dungeon ni Deai crossover power fantasy that essentially takes Percy from the end of Book 5 of the original series (which is good since I never made it past the 2nd/3rd books in Riordan's other series) and has him replace Bell in DanMachi.

There are a couple great Bleach fanfics, generally a few good timetravel ones and a few that deal with Ichigo's powers in interesting ways. Ones that really stood out include the every popular Hogyoku ex Machina and A Protector's Pride, the second of which did an impressive job of creating realistic original arcs and interpretations of canon while trying to stay canon-compliant with stuff that came out after the fic started. There are several good incomplete ones, like the one where Ichigo can see and talk to sword spirits even when no one else can see them. The first fanfic I wrote was actually for the Bleach fandom, so it has a bit of a special place in my heart.

There are a couple good Persona fanfics/crossovers, a couple good High School DxD fics/crossovers, a few good Pokemon fics, etc.

Other than that, my favorites list has a fair number of Naruto fanfics. I've never finished Worm, which is why I haven't delved into fics based on that universe, but I've heard good things.

Do you mean /Swords and Sorcery/ on the SB creative writing forums? It just updated last Tuesday.

The only other HP/Nasuverse crossovers I can begin to stand are... what are they called... /Crosswinds of Fate/ and /Fictional/.

linkffn(9340220) linkffn(5871255)

/Crosswinds/ actually has Potterverse Wizards and Nasuverse Magi react fairly-appropriately to their disparate magic systems and the distance between their cultures, while /Fictional/ reasonably steps aside the issue by making Harry into a Servant based on myth (rather than make the Potterverse equally real to the Nasuverse).

Both incomplete/abandoned, unfortunately.

****** Stars Over Terabithia was my very first fanfic. It holds a special place in my heart, and I had my first fanfic related heartbreak with it. First two actually--a major character dies in it, and then it gets canceled.

But what I mean to say is I think SoT is my favorite BTT fanfic because of how connected it is to the original. I've long held that "A Life Rescued," minus the confusing supernatural time-travel elements, is a superb YA fiction in its own right.

** linkffn(The Praises of Nayru: Link's Awakening) is probably my favorite fanfiction ever. I think [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4hc8rs/rtdcffc_the_praises_of_nayru_links_awakening_a/d2p39iv/][this comment]] describes it best. "This is very strange and dark and cold and beautiful. Link truly feels like a man a thousand years old, inhumanly cold and deeply impersonal. The story is set in a dream, and it feels like a thing of dream as well, full of unexpected twists and strangeness ... It is uncompromising, brutally so, but that makes the depth and meaning in every interaction more clear. Reading this felt like walking through a dark forest buried in snow, with the moon bright overhead. I love it, and would recommend that everyone give it a shot."

My favorite Naruto fanfiction is [[https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][The Waves Arisen]]. It's definitely a "power wank", but it manages to avoid the problems that most "power wanks" fall into and indeed fails in different ways than most other Naruto fanfics in general. Not for everybody but maybe give it a try.

linkao3(Move Fast And Break Things) is a MCU(marvel cinematic universe) fanfic with a gender swapped Tony Stark. It has a clever plot line and the author really brings Stark to life. Not perfect but really fun.

linkao3(Experiments on Doomed Timelines) is a Homestuck fic based of the popular sburb glitch faq (linkao3(Sburb Glitch FAQ)). Sburb glitch faq is a really fun world building piece and Doomed Timelines uses the setting to explore some pretty dark themes. Its well written and Also! still updating!

Also from Homestuck is linkao3(Collision by DaneelsSoul). This is a fun and clever oneshot that I am really fond of. I can't say more without spoiling it so suffice to say it's very good.

I think I'll stop here for now. Have fun reading! :)

I saved your life, but it shattered your spine and is lodged dangerously near your heart, giving you perhaps two weeks to live.” Toni considered this. “So what you're saying,” Toni said, “is that the bad news is that I'm crippled, and the good news is that I'm not going to have to be crippled for very long.”

Overlady, by Earth Scorpion, (Foz x Overlord): [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8753582/1/Overlady]] This might just be my favorite fic off all time. Superbly well written, Outrageously funny, action-packed, and covers a surprising amount of important topics related to maturation and coming of age, as well as first time crushes, and the urge to commit unspeakable evils :P Overlady is set in an AU world in which Knights slay dragons, heroes rescue damsels in distress and mages do battle with fierce demons from the depths bellow. Louise the zero, named so because she fails any and all spells cast, decides to run away she fails to cast the summon familiar spell, a coming of age ritual performed by all mages in her society. During her attempt to flee, she stumbles across an old abandoned tower, deep in the swamps. What is she to do when she unwittingly releases 'Gnarl' goblin adviser to past overlords? Join Louise on her journey from fledgling evil to the powerful and feared overlady of the north!

Currently I would say that there isn't any proper romances (at least not yet, it is still in the process of being written) I wont say who, but the main protagonist does develop a crush or two over the course of the series, but has yet to be seen if it will go any where.

Incidentally, i'm somewhat new to reddit..... sooo how do you tag spoilers? thanks in advance.

  Two beings born from darkness and one plunge into the dark. One raise to be the perfect aristocrat. The other raised to be the perfect weapon. The other a jewel from a fallen family. For this three to meet was unlikely, and yet, they met and formed a bond that could not be broken. A Monster, A Goddess, and A Scholar. A Prince, A Princess and An Assassin. {TatsuyaXMiyukixSuzune}

** *Divided by fandom*

Avengers/MCU:

- Damaged Defenders by Sherza, on Ao3 or ff.net-- absolutely freaking epic and still going. (This author is /solid/ and I would highly recommend all her works.)
- Love is For Children (series), on Ao3 by ysabetwordsmith-- so much psychology and fluff. Warning: non-sexual ageplay (in the vein of fixing damage from abuse).

Elementary:

- Divination and its series, by NyxEtoile

Discworld:

- EVERYTHING by A. A. Pessimal, on ff.net. The man expands so much on the Assassins' Guild and somehow manages to get TPratchett's tone just perfect.

** Ceasefire Days by sawruhr is a hilarious Team Fortress 2 fic that is a series of one-shots about what the mercs get up to during their days off. Characterization is spot-on.

Sarah1281's Star Wars KotOR fics (So Not My Problem, The Jedi Kind of Had it Coming, and Affably Evil) are wonderfully hilarious takes on the story of KotOR I and II. They are technically crack fics, as they follow the Rule of Funny, but they are worth a read. Revan is extraordinarily lazy, the Exile is naive, and Carth is confused.

CGAdam's Leaving Pandora is Hard to Do fic is one of the best Borderlands fics out there. Captures the feel of the games very well. There are two sequels, but one is abandoned.

Annonimous4862's Dragons is a wonderful Eragon/Skyrim crossover where the Dragonborn is summoned to Alagaesia and generally irritates everyone there. It is sadly abandoned, but what is there is very much wortb reading.

This Wasn't in the Brochure by otahyoni is one of the best damn Star Wars fics I ever read. If you are familiar with the Rogue Squadron books, this is an amazing read. Wes and Hobbie are on vacation, but things rapidly go off course.

** Hunger Games for me! linkffn(have heart my dear by monroeslittle) and linkffn(when the moon fell in love with the sun). Both are Katniss/Peeta and sooooo well written. The first is completed and one of the best things I've ever read. The second gets updated around Christmas and is totally worth it for the writing style alone... and all the food imagery.

  "It's something out of an old tale: a golden young man in a white bearskin, striking strange bargains with desperate souls on the cruelest night of winter." Peeta Mellark, winner of the 74th Hunger Games, returns from his Victory Tour to make the starving Everdeens an offer they can't refuse. Canon divergent, based on the fairy tale "East of the Sun and West of the Moon."
