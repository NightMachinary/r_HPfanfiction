I tried this before but now I'm expanding out of curiousity, here are some questions to help clarify what I mean:

1. Who is your favourite love interest for an OC protagonist?

2. Do you prefer OC to be during Marauders era? Harry's era? Tom's? Young Dumbledore's? Harry's kids? Even more in the future?

3. Do you prefer OC as child growing and finding way in magical world or adult already and trying to solve things?

4. Do you prefer OC related to canon characters or unrelated?

5. What bugs you most about OCs?

6. Do you have a fave OC fic? Please share

Feel free to answer some, none, or all of the above

Thank you :)

(I may make a separate thread detailing all of my OC ideas but that's later)


** I prefer SIs of those not part of the trio. Reading a story about some guy ending up in Ron's body, beating Voldemort and fucking every girl in Hogwarts is boring. SIs should feel somewhat displaced, angry and annoyed. Their knowledge would be useful but wouldn't make them macho magic gods. Have them be realistic, with their own motivations and goals outside of "correcting" the course of the trio or whoever. Because otherwise it's just a bog standard fix-it fic.

** Are you confused about Self Inserts and Original Characters? Because you did ask about Self Inserts in your title, but the paragraph is all about original characters. All self inserts are original characters, but most original characters are not self inserts.

I do not know what you are really asking about.

** I prefer OCs that aren't self-inserts, but I prefer canon characters over them.

** 1) Harry/ OC... because I like to read stories where Harry is the protagonist... 2) As long the plot is good, I'm not too fussy about the era... But I like Harry's era the most. 3) Both could work, and both have been done. Actually, more important than that, is if the OC is well-thought and well-written. 4) Unrelated... 5) I think that lots of readers/writers have a tendency to have a certain prejudice with OCs characters, because they do have a fame of not being very good. Well, I don't agree with this concept. For me there are well written and badly written stories with or without an OC character.

The reason why it might be easier for a writer to screw up an OC story, is that besides constructing an interesting plot, the OC story also requires de writer to be good at creating a realistic, well thought character (or characters). And some authors do have difficult time doing that. As like building up a plot, building an OC requires some levels of planning and consideration, otherwise you won't get it right.

I think the worse OC is the one who just take over the plot and magically solve everyone's problems - this worse kind of OC is also flawless and every canon character seem to like them without an effort.

If you want to build a good OC, let them screw things up a bit, this will make them seem more realistic. Just thing about the canon book characters... they all screw up things all the time.

Give them flaws, because everyone has that, and it will make it unrealistic if your character does not have issues... could be low-self steem, social akwardness, being a little bit self-centred... anything that you believe that might help your plot... endless options!

And then, try to understand your character background story and why they ended up being the way they are by thinking about a nature vs nurture perspective. (e.g. Duddley is a bully with his cousin Harry because his parents encouraged this behaviour by doing it themselves. However, in circunstances maybe Dudley would not be a bully). Explaining your OCs traits like this is a good character building exercise btw...

** I'm writing a self insert myself right now actually.

1. If its a self insert that was an adult put into a kids body then I'd prefer no pairing at all. If the self insert is an adult then I'd prefer the pairing either be nothing or a minor HP character.
2. I prefer Harry's era. Honestly, I don't think I've ever come across one from Tom's era and older.
3. I don't mind the OC growing up BUT I hate when it starts with them having to relive their lives as babies. So many fics get bogged down with 'adult mind in a baby body' garbage. A lot of them never even get past it. I generally like the ones that start at Hogwarts or later. If the self insert is inside one of the canon characters bodies them being clueless of the canon characters past can be kind of fun.
4. I prefer unrelated. If they are related, then the more obscure canon character the better.
5. I hate when everything comes easy to the self insert and their plans never go awry. Sometimes, the self insert should accidently make the world worse.
6. The Perks of Survival - [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-perks-of-survival-hp-si.311621/]]

** Hm...by the numbers, hm? ;)

1. Love interest, someone interesting or someone who needs (IMHO) liberating from a dismal choice of partner (Hermione needs liberating from (Mo-)Ron!)
2. Harry's Era (I don't like prequels, even if you change the timeline etc.)
3. Both are ok (but the child thing: Skip the baby-years, those are boring IMHO)...slight leaning towards "Oh shit, I don't think I am in Kansas anymore! I know stuff I did't before, I have a wand? Damned, where the hell am I?"
4. Unrelated (I hate giving a canon characters siblings especially, I can deal with them being losely related, but prefer not to!)
5. If OCs don't shake things up majorly then they aren't worth having :) (canon re-hashes are boring, too!)
6. Sorry, can't help you there (read too much stuff and sadly save any links -.-)

** I am always sceptical when it comes to OCs. Too often they are just shoved into your face without any reason to be there.

*** That's fair, I'm trying very hard to come up with an idea that hopefully will help the story rather than hinder. Fingers crossed.
