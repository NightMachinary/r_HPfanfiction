I've always been fascinated with the lore of wandmaking in the hp universe and just wish there was more of it! Like, what if Harry thought 'this basilisk fang would be a badass wand core'. I'm open to most pairings (no Bellatrix please), like slash, and no romance is fine as well.


** There's a certain amount of investigation into this in linkffn(The Arithmancer), though it's not the primary focus.

(It's a pretty cool story, too, though I'm lukewarm on the sequels.)

** "The Wandsmiths" linkffn(12723602) is about Garrick Ollivander's son and a Muggle-born witch set during the first war and has a big focus on wands and their creation.

  (Formerly titled The Ollivanders) Todd Ollivander can't seem to shake his feelings for the new apprentice at his father's wand shop. It's not a good time to be distracted, as it's becoming clearer and clearer that Ollivander's is a major target of Lord Voldemort's during the First Wizarding War.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4399301?view_full_work=true][Old Soul Reborn by Glaux_Bryonia]] is a Bleach/HP crossover, but entirely in HP-verse. Harry discovers his wand has a spirit and is sentient. He teaches his friends how to connect to their wands. It's a really interesting take on wandlore. linkao3(4399301)

My absoute favorite take on wandlore is from a Buffy/HP/Adams Family cross by Tenhawk. There are two fics *SCAU-DC Stranger in a Strange* *Verse* and *Alexander Harris and the Shadow Council*. The first is a Xander Harris goes to Hogwarts fic with Harry as a side character. Xander becomes a wandmaker and it's really fantastic world building. The second has Xander stranded in DC-verse and he spends a lot of time on wandmaking. Alas the website has been down for a while but you can join the yahoo group for access to the fics. [[https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/th_presents/info][Tenhawk yahoo group]]

In The Apple Tree by Philo Harry makes his own wand and there's some interesting wandlore. linkao3(4241040)

  The process of reincarnation isn't perfect, especially when it comes to the reincarnation of a soul that was very old and powerful during its previous life. Harry is a living example of this phenomenon, but it is not as great a blessing as you might expect. Death always takes its toll, and it's a heavy one.

  Char. Ooc, AU/AR, still within JK's world - Harry is apprenticed to a Diagon Alley businessman at the tender age of seven. From there the story changes... very mild bashing of some regulars.
