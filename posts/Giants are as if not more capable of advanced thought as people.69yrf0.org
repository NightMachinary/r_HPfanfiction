What if instead of air there was brain in those craniums and the only reason why giants are considered unintelligent is because wizards zerg rush them whenever they get past caveman like how white people would murder their slaves for the "crime" of being literate. further what if there was a post-war plan to do an uplift of the giants. maybe regardless of their intellectual capabilities, they were bogged down by violent tendencies like Bruce Banner who as the Hulk can technically be as if not more intelligent is bogged down by violence and personal issues to think past "HULK SMASH".

what is it that prevents giants from using their large brains and how can we uplift them?


** Your paragraph there is a bit all over the place, but I too would like to see a fic featuring intelligent giants.

*** well, I am the Donald Trump of this sub flinging shit onto the sub and hoping that some of it sticks so it's my job to be all over the place and not make sense just like its Donald Trumps job to have business everywhere without having any business sense.

edit: just saying, I'm talking about his business, not his politics.
