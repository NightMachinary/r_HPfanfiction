I am looking for a Fic that I remember from years ago.

Snaps survives the final battle and reveals the trick to flying without a broom.

Apparently it's to “throw yourself at the ground and miss”

I think he revealed it to Hermione

*** I remember Hermione saying “The dark lord can fly because of a muggle book?”

However, Hitchhikers Guide is my second favorite book

  Ever wonder how Voldemort could fly? Watch him pass his power onto Snape -- in case of a Potter attack. Oneshot.
