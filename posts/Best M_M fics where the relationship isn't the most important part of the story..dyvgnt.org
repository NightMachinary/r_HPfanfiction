I see so many "I want x, but no slash" here I gotta wonder what great stories I'm missing out on because of that.

I hear a common problem with slash is the story becomes about how gay everyone is / how deep and important the relationship is to the exclusion of all else, so specifically I'm looking for stories that happen to feature m/m couples that are about something else.

Also if Draco is involved, he should be basically an evil douchey coward in chapter 1. I don't need his redemption arc to be masterful but the assumption that he doesn't even need one grinds my gears.

Also also if it's Snarry Harry has to be [[http://www.reenigne.org/creepy/][at least 25]]

  The Wizarding Wars are over, but the work of recovery has only begun. Remus Lupin is trying to find his place in an ever-changing world, and when he is invited to serve on a truth and reconciliation commission, he has to confront the truth that lives there---in the past and within himself.

** linkao3(15465966) /The Second String/ is a Harry Potter/Gideon Prewett fic, where Harry's soul is displaced to the 1970's by a dementor's kiss. The romance takes several years to start, and is the definition of slow burn. The main focus of the fic is the build up to the first war

linkao3(20097676) /My Sun Sets to Rise Again/ is a Sirius/Remus fic that deals with alternate realities Sirius experiences when he falls through the veil.

linkao3(15735828) /La Magique etude du Bonheur/ is a Regulus/OMC fic where Regulus is sorted into Ravenclaw. The fic has lots of Black Family drama and deals with the build up to the first war.

linkao3(13760487) /The Dogfather/ is another Sirius/Remus fic where they raise Harry.

linkao3(235547) /The Prisoner's Remorse/ is past Sirius/Remus and past Dumbledore/Grindelwald. Dumbledore gets Remus a job as a Nurmengard guard after Halloween 1981.

linkao3(7331278) /Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run/. Harry/Draco where Harry never learned about magic.

** There's this one time travel tomarry fic (don't worry, there's literally no smut, only implied, it's a VERY slow burn that's not romantically centered, and there's no adult/teen nonsense) where Harry had an "accident" and travelled back in time to the 1940s and attended school with Tom. It was called /"Wear Me Like a Locket Around Your Throat"/ , I'm pretty sure, and it was AMAZING. The romantic tension was nonexistent in the beginning, and Tom and Harry had this on and off friendship/rivalry thing, and it's not even centered around them? It builds on the home lives of some other supporting characters, like Orion Black, and gives some insight to the suffragist movement and the Muggle world a little bit. Druella and Walburga are also both characterized pretty well outside of "bad no good harpy jealous women", and honestly I live for the plot. There are also as lot more things that happen, but there's too much to really describe out of things that would be spoilers. I really recommend it, it's not edgy or dark or anything, it's actually a pretty good contrast amongst "overly-pretty-succubus-dark-powerful-Harry" slash fics.

It starts off a little slow been becomes VERY interesting and pretty dark. The new triwizard tournament tasks are downright terrifying but really fantastic.

** I read a lot of Remus/Sirius, so these all feature that pairing.

For funny dialogue and a really inventive version of the triwizard tournament, there's 'Into the Fire'. It's got excellent charactarization as well. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16281977/chapters/38077013#workskin]])

I love everything by the Divine Comedian. As far as I'm concerned they're the best writer in the HP verse, with really unique, funny and scary takes on things like boggarts and polyjuice potion and dementors. 'Blackpool' is really popular on this site, but I'll recommend another one which features an alternative ending for the 31st of october, 1981. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13281801/chapters/30392982]])

For a fancy, very literary style, I'd recommend anything by Montparnasse, who writes both slash and femmeslash. For instance linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10400106]])

A novel-length coming-of-age one that's very popular is 'All the Young Dudes'. It gives Remus a very alternative upbringing and backstory and otherwise keeps to canon. It's excellent if you like binging on the 70's and the music of that decade. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10057010/chapters/22409387]])

Finally, this is perhaps the most heartbreaking story I've ever read. Sticks to canon, is beautifully written and deeply traumatizes you. You need an AO3 account to read it. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/392015]])

  While war brews on the horizon beyond the walls of Hogwarts, the infamous Triwizard Tournament resurfaces just in time for the Marauders' seventh year. It's one more reason for Remus Lupin to pull out his hair and prematurely wrinkle. And another reason? It walks, talks (too much), and chews up Remus' belongings while in dog form.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16586783][dear forgiveness, i saved a plate for you]] linkao3(16586783) is not a fic I get to rec here often, since it's both for /Fantastic Beasts/ and slash, but it's one of the best Dumbledore character studies I've ever found. Oneshot.

** This is a story where Snape makes friends with the portrait in Slytherin common room and one night, the man in the portrait steps outside and becomes a bad arse DADA professor and later on, there's a romantic relationship. The man has come from the time of the Founders, so the fanfic has historical levels and also the present-day battle against Voldemort. So even that the romance is there, it gets descriptive very rarely and the amounts of research that have gone to most of the details in history (and sometimes otherwise too) are commendable.

** I wrote Drarry where they are Soul Bound together and there's no smut between them >.>

I made Seamus get shagged by an OMC, though, and that was awesome XD

+Edit: Also, try asking this on [[/r/HPSlashFic]] because slash stuff here tends to get downvoted to hell+ I was wrong, which is AWESOME
