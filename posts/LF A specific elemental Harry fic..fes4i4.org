:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I can't seem to remember the name of this fic no matter what. Additionally I can't find it whenever I look for it as well.

So Harry wakes up one day, in a park, no memories of magic, can't seem to remember much. And is then found by level/category six air elemental........ (snitch, I can't remember her name) and then taken to a hospital, he's tested and comes out as another level 6 air elemental, and the other one proceeds to adopt him and it goes on. I remember a good deal of the story if you need more details. I just can't remember the name. Pls help if you can.


** Ive read that one too but unfortunately I cant remember anything either

**** I gave it a try and found the writing to be mediocre at best, does it get any better?

***** I'd say that the later chapters are better, there's a sequel to it. But I've never read it. Honestly, I don't think it's the greatest fic I've ever read, but I'd probably put in my top 100. I just wanted to know the name of it because it's been sitting just out of my recollection and it was starting to annoy me that I couldnt remember it.

I think it could be a very great fic, the world building has been done pretty well, and there is plenty of room to improve, I simply think that it's at best, 40% percent of a truly good fic. There's some tropes to it of course. But what fic doesn't have any?

****** is not about the tropes, is about poor characterization and bad dialogue flow, I just don't think is worth the time if it continues beyond the first 5 chapters I read
