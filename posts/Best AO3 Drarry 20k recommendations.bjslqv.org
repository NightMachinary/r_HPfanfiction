I really loved Written on the Heart by who_la_hoop, The Standard You Walk Past by bafflinghaze, and my all time favourite has been Tea and No Sympathy by who_la_hoop. I don't mind shorter recommendations but longer are preferred.


** Read all the Advent fics by Saras_Girl on ao3. Seriously, they are freakin incredible.

Also, I just finished tea and no sympathy. I have to say I wasn't a big fan of some of the store's inconsistencies, it felt like there were a few things not thought through well enough. What really caught me though, and ultimately made me like the story very much, was the way Draco was portrayed. It was seriously one of the most realistic shortly-post-war depictions I've read in a long time.

*** Thanks for the recommendation. Like I said, it's my favourite so I don't recall anything I dislike particularly much about it though I'm sure there must be some.

  She almost smiles, and true alarm starts to build in his chest. “I'm afraid I'm not here for something so small. Professor Roberts has resigned.”“Good,” Draco says honestly, “Would you like a list of suitable alternatives? I know a number of competent potions masters abroad, but then of course you'd have to hire another teacher to act as the Slytherin head. I'm afraid you've dried up all the half decent Slytherin Potions masters.”“Not all of them,” she says quietly.He blinks. She can't be serious. “You can't be serious.”“Gravely,” she says, “Mr. Malfoy, I am not above begging.”What the bloody fuck. “I don't even like potions!”~Draco returns to Hogwarts. He has a duty to his blood and his name and his house, and he will fulfill it.
