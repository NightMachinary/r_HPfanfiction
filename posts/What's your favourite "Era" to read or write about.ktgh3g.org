Marauder Era, Founders Era, The First Wizarding War/Grindlewald Era, Golden Trio/Hogwarts Era, Post-War Era, Next Gen? (I've probably missed an era...)

I'm a fan of Marauder Era fics. I just love the characters and potential and humour tragedy ðŸ˜„


** Hogwarts era because I like thinking about what could have happened if X, or experiencing what happened in canon from a different perspective, usually through a different character.

I also like the Marauders Era, the characters are quite strong. I really like Remus and Sirius's friendship and how Remus reins in barely-sane Sirius. I like James and Lilly separately but am bored of Jilly. I think it's because in fanfic I get bored with canon ships.

** Personaly I'm a fan of timetravel Marauder era, Grindelwalds era and the Fantastic Beasts stuff as well although I do like the Golden Trio's era. I'm a fan of both history and time travel fics leading me to prefer WW2 era stuff generaly but it also makes me a sucker for Anything set in the past expecialy if it as time travel (which you can probably tell from above.

Overall, I would say my faverout is WW2 era although I will go on the record and say that I Strongly Dislike Next Gen stuff.

** Overwhelmingly the post-war era, though I love an angsty story set during a prolonged war, a good time travel into the marauder era, or a fluffy hogwarts era story.

*** There is a LOT of potential to unlock in the post-war era. Nearly all of the ones I've read in the era have the characters attending funerals early on. However, a world without Fred Weasley alive = :(.

**** It's hard finding a good post war fic because it's usually Harry sobbing ever five minutes and massively guilt tripping himself and everyone around him 14/7. It's kind of cringe tbh

***** Oh God I'm glad I'm not the only one.

I know different strokes for different folks and all, and if authors want to write "Whump" that's up to them, especially if it helps them with things in their own lives. But Jesus Christ is it too much to ask for a protagonist with more emotional resistance than wet tissue paper?

******* That's fair. I tend to read Hermione focused fics instead of Harry focused ones. Perhaps that's why they are less angsty?

** The overwhelming vast majority of the stories I read are Hogwarts era that may span +/- 2 years on each end (not counting any 19+ year epilogues).

The next largest group are primarily time travel/Marauder's era.

I have maybe 2-3 next gen stories and the same number of Founder's era.

** I read a lot of Harry's Hogwarts era, post-war and future fics that ignore the epilogue so a lot of my favorites are from those eras. Somehow I never could immerse myself fully into Marauder Era fics unless they were AU, probably because I know that the friendship would break and Lily and James would die. Next gen isn't really my cup of tea unless they're the ones written by Northumbrian. There were a couple of Grindelwald Era fics I used to follow but they sadly were abandoned. I haven't really read any Founders Era fics outside of time travel ones where the traveler jumped to that time, stayed for a short while then returned to the present.

This probably wouldn't qualify as an 'era' but I also liked a few fics that covered Tom Riddle's 'lost years,' which is placed between Grindelwald's fall and the Marauders era. These time periods tend to overlap with each other.

** hogwarts era and marauders era. before, I liked after the war fics, mostly 8th year, and then them being aurors, but I reverted back to school again. I don't read before marauders era at all. and I don't enjoy fics that are too far into the future either (their kids being adults or hogwarts age). I'm ok with fics inbetween, so first war, and the period between the end of first war to Harry's first year, but fics in school (marauders/trio) are my favs.

** Marauders era, especially if there's timetravel involved. There's so much space for imagination because little is said about the marauders's lives in the books. When Hermione or someone in the golden trio era is written to go back in time, its really interesting to see the potential for a changed outcome. However, its kind of cool reading a marauders fanfic, and knowing that there's a inevitable fate for all of them that they don't know of yet.

**** Apologies for the late reply, but a user I found made a spreadsheet of a load of Hermione time turner fanfics which I think would be helpful. It's regularly updated and states the name of the fanfic, if it has smut (or just the rating), who Hermione is shipped with, and the link of the fic itself. A lot of my favourites are on there like The Last Marauder by Resa Aureus and A Good Life by kkwide

** I have to say that I prefer Golden trio generally because that is an era that dosen't make me want to scream out loud when it is being mistreated. With the earlier eras I just get really annoyed if the author doesn't think about the era enough and the story becomes anachronistic. Which is a shame because I love the first half of the 20th century from a storytelling perspective.
