The draw of these stories, for me, is the portrayal of a fucked up Potter family dynamic. The problem, of course, is that most authors don't really have the life experience or nuance to make it fucked up in believable ways, and so they have the Potters et all, who are by all accounts more or less decent, viciously neglect or abuse their own child.

I'm not looking for those kinds of stories.

What I am looking for is a credible story about family dysfunction. (One can easily see it happening: very young parents, overwhelmed by the fame of one sibling or the danger that sibling is in, make a few mistakes.) For example:

([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5459861/18/Harry-s-decision]]) Interesting and unusual story in which Harry is left with Petunia due to magical reasons, while his two siblings, including the proclaimed BWL live with Lily and James. Interesting part comes in where the proclaimed BWL is the insecure one because of the pall Harry's absence leaves in the Potter household, and many other reasons.

Prince of Slytherin: a bit over the top, at times, but both the mistreatment of Harry at the Dursely's and his abandonment by the Potter's have been foreshadowed as arising due to a plot, rather than inexplicable sadism.

Hoping for tragic recommendations, but not 'Unsung hero' type stories where there is a relentless and inexplicable campaign against Harry by pretty much everybody. No, I would rather something like the aforementioned stories or

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10860114/1/The-Brother]] - neglect stemming from his potential status as a squib, and the fact that the Potter's travel around with the BWL and Dumbledore due to reasons. While the premise is a bit contrived, I like how Harry deals with it.


** Have you read the Sacrifices Arc? That's a classic, and probably one of the most interesting and complex WBWL child abuse/neglect stories on FF.net. The first book is Saving Connor. linkffn(Saving Connor by Lightning on the Wave)

In it, the prophecy is significantly different. The younger twin--the "innocent" twin--is prophesied to be the one to kill Voldemort, and the older twin is prophesied to be his powerful protector. The younger twin Connor is the WBWL, and Harry is his "guardian."

Lily and Dumbledore, in an attempt to ensure the prophecy comes true and Voldemort is defeated, train Harry from a young age to be his brother's protector. They want to keep Connor "innocent" as the prophecy requires, which means Harry has to be the one prepared to kill and fight.

The child abuse/family dynamics are subtle. It's not obvious stuff like James and Lily outright being mean to/ignoring Harry. Lily brainwashes Harry into making his brother the center of his world, and Harry slowly breaks out of his mental conditioning as he grows older. It fits the tragic bill perfectly, from start to finish, and the family dynamics seem normal on the surface but are so incredibly creepy and fucked up the further you look between the lines.

It is slash, but don't let that deter you because the slash is in the background and doesn't show up until book 5. The slash relationship also makes a lot of sense, since Harry and Draco are platonic best friends for years before becoming lovers. I'm probably going to be downvoted for rec'ing slash on this sub, but really... if you want a credible WBWL, Sacrifices Arc is it. Just give it a chance.

The only other good WBWL I've read is Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by the Santi, but it's not really an abuse/neglect story. Lily and James are normal parents and Harry is just tired of/jealous of his brother's fame. Still worth a read, even if it's abandoned. linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi)

...And the rest of the WBWL stories I've read aren't very good.

** I'll hesitantly recommend Deprived.

There isn't any abuse; it's all unintentional neglect on the part of the parents. There isn't much background on the abuse. What's more interesting is that this is one of the few WBWL fics in which the parents seem to genuinely regret their actions. It simply happened because they paid too much attention to one child. They lacked the parenting experience to balance the affection each received.

It's also good because Dumbledore isn't an evil manipulator; neither are Sirius and Lupin conspirators in the abuse/neglect/be -mean-to -Harry conspiracy.

On the downside it is incomplete, trope-ridden, and Harry is something of a Gary Stu.

** I have also taken quite an interest in WBWL stories myself, and I have found that...suspense building space...

Most of them are trash. That is not to say that there aren't any good ones, I personally love prince of slytherin Antithesis by OceanBreeze is fairly good, and the previous (Antithesis is a rework of one of her old fics and is not finished) finished fic is mildly decent if a bit childish and confusing

Midnight Sun is also good, I cannot remember the authors name, but the sequel is called darkest before dawn. These are good fics in my opinion and serve for a dysfunctional family but it has a very abusive James for a fairly decent reason (you'll have to read to find out because it's a major spoiler)

Besides those I cannot think of any fics in particular that stood out besides POS

** Kaleidoscope of Magic.

A rather contrived premise - Harry needs immense betrayal to awake latent powers -- and mediocre writing. But, it is the reactions of the people after the powers have been awakened that make this story interesting: they are human reactions, in a way. They sympathize with the immense anger that he feels, make a lot allowances for it, while at the same time try to urge him to overcome it as the pain was a necessary requirement for him to be able to save the world (multiverse). The author tries to make Harry a tragic, half-crazed figure (albeit shading too often into a brat), and as the story progresses, it's clear to Harry that his out-of-control anger is a huge hindrance to everybody's goals. It is not a strong story, but unlike so many stories in this trope, the characters are not complete caricatures and there is a surprising amount of pathos to be found.
