** It's actually a popular fan theory that he did indeed fix Hagrid's wand and they're simply hiding it in Hagrid's Umbrella

**** I figured he privately tutored Hagird over the years when they both had time to spare from their respective jobs.

****** He's decent enough, the only spell we ever see him fail at is turning Dudley into a Pig, but we already know that Human transfiguration is quite complicated and he attempted it without incantation. He does show other N.E.W.T level skills though, like being able use Aguamenti and has shown proficiency in silent magic.

Though I doubt he was tutored for 40 years, I think we can assume that he was at least taught for a while after he was expelled.

******* Plus if he's hiding his wand in his umbrella, he has to cast through an imperfect focus - who knows what that does to his spells.

** I think the size of the wand is proportional the size of the person wielding it. So even pieces of Hagrid's wand should be sufficient enough to cast magic with.
