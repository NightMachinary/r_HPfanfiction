I'm in a bit of a slump. Looking for fics I prefer romance preferably from Harry's pov at least most of the time and not in first person and that doesnt feel right for a hp fic. No slash but harems or smut are fine. Over use tropes are fine. I just need something to take me out of my head

** I'm sorry I don't really read romance all on it's own bc it makes Harry Potter too real for me. I do, however, read pure shameless smut and if you want it I can recommend it

*** Dont mind smut it's fun. Especially when theres some plot attached lol. I read romance or I guess more accurately action romance to live vicariously.

** This is gonna be a long list.

Maybe try The International Triwizard Tournament by Salient Casuality, it's an ongoing harem set in 4th year with 457k words to its name. Has drama, politics, good relationships, and is really just good though I get a bit annoyed with Harry at times. A very original story and compelling original characters.

Perhaps Return of the Death Walker by WhiteDevilMGN. Harem, time travel, Slytherin Harry, manipulative Dumbledore, Weasley bashing. 295k words and still ongoing. Not really my cup of tea but probably check it out just in case.

I imagine you've already read Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches by LeadVonE but if not definitely check it out. Harem, time travel, politics, 645k words to its name and still ongoing, definitely one of the best.

Try Barefoot by Zaxaramas as well if you haven't. Harry x Tonks, 153k words, still ongoing, and one of my personal favorites. Quite original and just good.

I'm going to suggest Prodigal Delinquent by Ethereal Euphoria even though it's not what you're looking for. 73k words and I'm really hoping it's still going. No romance but might be my favorite Harry Potter fic really just an enjoyable read.

I hope you find one that you can enjoy.
