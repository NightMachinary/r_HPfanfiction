Something similar to this: linkffn(Society of the Vesta Accolates by mandymld)


** Mobile so I can't add a link, but Harry's Cousins by speculating was pretty good.

Basically, a pre-Hogwarts Harry finds a book on Wizarding heritage and contacts the Malfoys, who are his closest living relatives. Dumbledore bashing (obviously), but at least it's limited and the story's interesting, if slow.

*** linkao3(Harry's Cousins by speculating)

Hope this works and is the correct fanfic you're talking about. Looks interesting from the quick view I did while searching for it.

  The Dursleys have never wanted Harry, so when he fortuitously stumbles across a book on Wizard Family Trees, he writes a letter, hoping to find another family to take him in, hopefully one that won't mind when he does 'freaky' stuff....WIP
