Wherein I was HP, summer prior to 5th year, and I was standing just outside Number 12 Grimmauld Place, yelling at Sirius because he had been pranking the French, and then an owl dropped off a letter informing us that the French would be dropping a tactical nuke on Grimmauld Place in retaliation, and Sirius had no idea that this was bad, and was just laughing hysterically, so I threw him into my car, grabbed the steering wheel, apparated the whole thing away, and turned to see the mushroom cloud growing over London.

The rest of the dream was me trying to explain to Sirius why this was so bad.
