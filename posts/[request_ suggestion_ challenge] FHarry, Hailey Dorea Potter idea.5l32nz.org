** My feedback: This is not a challenge, this is a commission.

If you want to keep issuing challenges, do them as a prompt. A very short prompt. You could orient yourself on the [[/r/WritingPrompts]] subreddit. The more detail you ask for, the less input the author can deliver and the less likely will anyone be compelled to write it. The way you did it here is as if the next sentence would read "I offer 10$ for every 500 words to write my story idea."
