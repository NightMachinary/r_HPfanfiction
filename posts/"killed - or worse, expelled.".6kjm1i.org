Thought that kept me up at night: What if there was a very good reason Hermione rated being expelled as being worse than death?

What could it /be/?!

** Lots of fics equate expelled before OWLs to wand snapped and magic bound, then exiled to muggle world. That might well be worse than death to some people (though not a muggleborn, I wouldn't think)

It probably comes down to death not seeming like a real consequence at 11, but being expelled is.

she found out that she is part of a different world, where she was going to learn to manipulate reality on a whim and then you take away her ability to use her powers and force her back to a mundane life right after she learned some things some people would kill for to learn how to do them.

I think its even worse for muggleborns. They get introduced to a magical world and told they are a part of it and then there is the chance they have to return and be normal like everyone else

Not really. Muggleborns understand how to live without Magic, sure, they saw the world, but it being taken away from them isn't any less terrible than them simply leading a normal life again.

*** The scariest possibility (to me) is that HG read between the lines of the history books, and is well aware that being a muggleborn unable to defend herself is in a very bad place (tortured to death by magic-KKK is worse than being killed outright).

If 11-year-old HG was anywhere nearly as well read as I was... Honestly, I /could/ see me being a goody-two-shoes out of sheer terror.

Also, if there is any kind of memory-removal in such a case... one of the only things that terrifies me as much as death itself is losing any part of my /self/.

Molly also said "You could have died. You could have been found!" when Weasley boys rescued Harry with that flying car.

** I'm late to this conversation, but it always bothered me that so many people looked far too deep into that statement.

When Hermione says this, she's 12 years old. She likely has no experience with death first hand and, while she almost assuredly understands the concept, she probably doesn't /really/ get it.

Even putting that aside, in case anyone is forgetting: When she says this, they'd all just run away from a giant, three-headed Cerberus, "Fluffy". She, and likely Harry and Ron, weren't exactly all with it after that experience at 1AM in the morning after a day of classes.

And onto that that Hermione is, at this point in the story, /huge/ on gaining the acceptance of authority figures. For her, being expelled would be the ultimate acknowledgement of failure. I'm not saying "Dead; or worse, expelled" is a good priority set, but I know /I/ certainly have things I'd be willing to die to avoid/finish.

*** To be fair, I would rather be dead than a failure as well. I completely understand Hermione's POV here. Especially my 12-year-old self...doing poorly and not getting into my dream school or failing at something, esp. academically, was a far more terrible prospect than death at that age. To be frank..it STILL is.

I would much rather be dead than expelled. And I'm in my 20s.

** AU in which Hogwarts is the last bastion of humanity in an apocalyptic war against some kind of great threat: Demons, Aliens, mutated Dementors. The castle is huge, but even it has limits, so there is a fixed number of people allowed to live in it. Also, there's a number of couples who want to have children, so the population is always increasing. Misbehave, and they will favor the newborn child (a blank slate) over a criminal. So, if you get expelled, they will kick you Outside where you'll be tortured forever.

**** Well for muggleborn Hermione, Durmstrang wasn't an option as they don't take muggleborns. Beauxbatons is in France...and while I understand that Hermione had some passing knowledge of French, it likely is not enough to read, write, speak and learn exclusively in French. Also...I'm pretty sure most parents of 12 year olds would NOT be okay with sending them off to another country while they remained behind, so not only would she have to become fluent in another language, her parents would too, and they would have to move their dental practice. While today, that is much easier, in the 1990s, it was relatively difficult to move a practice from one country to another, even in Europe.
