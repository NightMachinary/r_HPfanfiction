Trying to find a specific fic where Harry sneaks into Snape's bedroom and makes love to him while Snape fakes being asleep, throwing off Harry's sleeping spell.

It was Post War, with Harry as Defense Professor, on [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]] rated M. I think it was 3 or 4 chapters long.

Any help? Thankies.


** I know I have definitely read something like this before. It's on the tip of my tongue lol. Try [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]]?
