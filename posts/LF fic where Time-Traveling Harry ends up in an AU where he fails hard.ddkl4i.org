:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember that he was originally very successful at saving the world and was doing speed runs of the Wizarding War arc on his original universe until the sorting hat decided to send him to a harder universe where the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff rivalries run much deeper than the canon Gryffindor-Slytherin rivalry ever did and Harry ends up having to switch houses. I'm pretty sure there was a beast of Hufflepuff or something like that and a whole bunch of students didn't make it out of Hogwarts that particular year.

If anyone wants to rec other fics where a time traveling Harry tries and fails to save the world on his second or subsequent go around, feel free to do so as well.

Thanks in advance!
