  True friends always find some way to surprise you. Sometimes it's because they never give up on you, and others it's because they have an invisibility cloak. Kind of cheating really. This story is FemHarry/Hermione with some terrible jokes mixed in. Mostly lighthearted. Very Mild adult references and content.

  Soul Bonds are a known fact. But what if there were those with more than one name? What if they were involved with threats from aliens and from magicals hidden in our own who wanted to enslave one of their own due to her heritage? Her kind has been hunted for years, and all Cassia wants is peace. Will she and Hermione find it in New York? Read AN for warnings about pairings inside.

  This is inspired by a story I read, it'll follows Talia Potter (femHarry) and her journey. I write a book a chapter, meaning this will be a 7 long chapter story, only the first chapter leans on canon heavily. I plan twists later. All reviews will be answered, so please review respectfully.

**** Well, I called all the links from a related thread. Usually I pick one where my story was already mentioned, but after the bot did its thing, I noticed that the reference thread didn't include my story, so I added it in.

There's also a mitigating factor -- Holly isn't exactly fem!Harry, and her romance with Hermione isn't the 'final' pairing.
