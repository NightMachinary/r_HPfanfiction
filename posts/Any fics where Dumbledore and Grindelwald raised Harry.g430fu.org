I always thought what would have happened if young Albus managed to reform a young Grindelwald and they ended up as a proper couple. I'm sure he would have been fine with raising Harry in the home with 2 of the most powerful wizards in the world.


** That sounds interesting. But there are some flaws to having this. Why would Harry be raised by them if his parents didn't die. What if he wasn't the chosen one because Tom riddle wouldn't follow exactly in Grindelwald footsteps. Dumbledore probably wouldnt be headmaster since he would settle down with Grindelwald. He probably wouldn't give Snape a second chance because Grindelwald wouldn't trust him. Many things

*** I feel like Tom pretty much did his own thing and wasn't really influenced by Grindelwald much?

**** He was influenced slightly. That's why I said included other options. But Tom's goal was to be the greatest dark lord after he heard of Grindelwald so he knew that it could be done. If there was no modern day dark lord he might have done things different. Not saying he would dbe good, but maybe not full blown dark lord and everything.

***** I mean, he could just as well end up seeing Grindelwald as weak for being "defeated" by love and resolve to do what he couldn't.

(Of course, this route would need Gellert to have actually started his campaign before Dumbledore got through to him)

** I've not read anything with a reformed Grindelwald, so I have no recommendations, but I find the implications and possibilities of a reformed Gellert far greater than the idea of the two raising Harry.

Gellert's fall to darkness guided Albus' path through life as much as it did his own. As teenagers they built castles in the sky wherein they ruled the world together, muggle and magical alike. Albus only abandoned those dreams when the death of his sister forced him to acknowledge the darkness in Gellert and in himself. Grindelwald's rise to power only made Albus more sure of his decision to avoid claiming such power for himself, not trusting himself with it.

Reforming Gellert would likely see Gellert in a similar position. Living a life careful not to succumb to temptation. Would they have redirected their desires to rule the world for its own good to a more positive outlet, or would they have withdrawn from the spotlight? Its possible that he would have gone into education as well, or possibly into research, or dueling to allow him to stretch his power in a safe way. The amount of magical blood that wouldn't be spilled during Grindelwald's war would dramatically change the world just on its own. The contributions of Albus and Grindelwald as magical prodigies would likely further change the world.

Its possible that between the two of them, having successfully pulled themselves back from the edge of darkness would be more sensitive to the plight of a young Tom Riddle and prevented his own fall. Perhaps they weren't in education at that time, and Tom followed his path still, would the two of them stand to fight against Tom? I can't see why they wouldn't. Voldemort feared Dumbledore alone, he would have no chance against the two of them together.

I'm honestly not sure how to even get them into a position to raise Harry in a believable manner unless the two of them became pacifists or something and didn't fight against Voldemort at all. Which could be a good source of drama once Harry is old enough to realize that his dads made a choice not to fight, and that their choice let Voldemort kill his parents. Coming to terms with that would be an interesting thing to see.
