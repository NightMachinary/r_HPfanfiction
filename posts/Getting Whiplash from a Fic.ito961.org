I started the fic Harry Potter and the Rejected Path by zArkham and going through the first chapter was pretty standard angsty 6th year Harry and whatnot. Using the FF app I was listen to chapter 2 and it immediately goes into extensive detail of the fact that Harry is sexually repressed with catholic guilt and that Wizarding society promotes adolescent sexual relations. I've never been thrown so hard. Has anyone else ever experienced something like that?


** I think it was Heir. Tom had had been Harry's imaginary friend as a child, helping him out with the Dursleys and teaching him a bit of magic before school.

Once they got to school it turned out Voldemort and Snape were lovers and Severus recognized his beloved's soul in young Harry. WTF, I noped out of there.

** I remember one fic that was a perfectly average though well-written (paced and plotted) 'Harry befriends everyone and is powerful and popular' fic, until suddenly Harry turned around to Hermione in the middle of a DADA lesson (I think?) and suddenly started talking about how homosexuality causes Squibs and that's why every magical-raised person (and Harry) was shunning their fellow classmate who was recently forcefully de-closeted.

The Author Note on that chapter was a very rambly mess about how the author was a proud Christian woman teaching young girls in a rural American town and how everyone had the right to an opinion (Which, y'know... if your only justification for your opinion is that it's not illegal to have, you really need a better opinion) and we shouldn't be mad for her expressing things there.

I didn't read any more of that fic.

*** Ya know, I've seen the title, never read it because the first few reviews of it were rather disparaging on Harry's character. Didn't realize it got worse

** In "Harry Potter and The Iron Lady" the Weasleys burst out in /prayer/ in Chapter 18.

Holy crap. What a way to kill suspension of disbelief.

** The most abrupt whiplash I've hit was from a non-HP fanfic ("People Lie", a Naruto fic), but plenty of other stories have pulled a more gradual bait-and-switch. HPMOR certainly comes to mind...

** I read one that was developing a slow-burn romance between Harry and Luna that suddenly became a full-blown dom/sub relationship.

There was another one that started out pretty good, until, suddenly, George W. Bush is visiting Voldemort, thanking him for the contribution to his campaign for governor of Texas, and offering his help in reciprocation. Around that time, formal courtly language also started being used by the Hogwarts students.
