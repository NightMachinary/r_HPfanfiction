Inspired by [[/u/Taure]]'s recent post on how to perfect the Independent Harry genre, I thought it would be interesting for this subreddit to discuss several other of the most prevalent genres in the fandom.

Let's start with Slytherin Harry - a genre that, I feel, still lacks its defining story, its masterpiece. /On the Way to Greatness/ is generally held up as the best of the genre, but is sadly incomplete - and with no update for five years now, seems to be definitively abandoned. This fate seems to be repeated across many other Slytherin Harry stories, such as /They Shook Hands, Harry Potter & The Slytherin Selection,/ and many more.

This is a real shame, because there's so much potential to be explored by a story within this genre - with Harry as a character, with the characters within Slytherin, and with the wider wizarding world.

Similar to Taure's excellent post, I'm going to post a couple of comments that can give a basis from which discussion can bring, and of course, it would be fantastic for other people to come in with thoughts and questions of their own.


** One of the biggest questions that needs to be answered is how Harry's relationships - with his classmates, his professors, and the wider wizarding world - might develop differently, should he be sorted into Slytherin.

Some stories in this genre have Harry befriend Draco, and fall in with his group. This approach opens up all sorts of questions - how will Lucius Malfoy react to his son befriending the ‘Boy Who Lived'? Will these friends stick by Harry when Voldemort returns? Will Harry be dragged down by his blood purist friends, or will he help to uplift them?

Another approach is to develop some of the blank slate characters to be Harry's friends. Common candidates are Blaise Zabini, Tracey Davis, and Daphne Greengrass. What opportunities can these characters offer? How closely should they follow their ‘fanon' personalities that readers know and expect? Whatever the answer is, this gives the author a lot of freedom.

How will Snape view a Harry sorted into Slytherin? Will he come to like him, or resent him even more? What about Dumbledore? Will he notice the parallels between Harry and Voldemort? What other characters might react to Harry's sorting in interesting ways?

What are your thoughts?

*** My response may end up being long, so I will try to divide the questions. Also, I am working on a Slytherin Harry fic so most of what I say will the same as my Headcanon for this fic.

​

- /How would his relationship with his classmates change ?/

Canon, and Gryffindor Harry is not someone sociable, he spends most of his time with Ron and Hermione, and sometimes with some other students, though mostly Gryffindors like Neville or Ginny.\\
I think this would be different for a Slytherin Harry, partly because a Slytherin Harry would be at least a little different than Gryffindor one (Nature Vs Nurture), and partly because unlike Gryffindor, Slytherin would not be a safe house for Harry, and he would be forced to take part to some House Politic in only to not be assaulted and made a Pariah. I also want to specify that while I believe Slytherin has a little more "House Politic" than other Houses, it's still children Politic. I find the idea that Slytherin have a Dueling Pit in their Common Rooms or official unofficial positions such as the Triumvira ridiculous.

​

Concerning his personnal relations, I would imagine they would be like this :

*Ron and Hermione* : Acquaintances, maybe friendly one with Ron if they were together in the train. Harry would not really know them and the House difference would make it harder for friendship to grow. I also doubt that the Trio would fight a troll together to seal the friendship (without Harry to talk to, it's not assured Ron would make Hermione in this particular day. Even if he did, Harry would not know, and probably not care about it. Hermione can die, survive, or just not be in danger, but I doubt she would finish so close to Harry. Considering this Harry would have to mind the junior Death Eater, I also doubt he would give them more bullet to fire by getting so close to a blood traitor and a mudblood (maybe to prove a point, but in this case it would probably later when he can defend himself, not 1st year while knowing 1 spell).

*Draco* : Still an antagonist. I know a lot of Slytherin Harry fic make him best friend to Harry and basically a better sidekick than Ron (better duelist, more intelligent, richer . . .), but for me Draco is an entilted child who would feel threatened by having a Harry Potter so close to him. Malfoy (both father and son), are character that act too proud to bow to anyone until extremely powerfull (IE Voldemort) make them fall in the role of sycopant. 1st year Harry would not have this kind of power so I would still make Harry the main antagonist for Harry.\\
Concerning the father, Lucius, I would make him wish Draco would befriend Harry, conforted in the idea that Harry IS the next Dark Lord by his Sorting. And be a little annoyed by the lack of success of his son.

*Pansy* : Same as Canon, bigoted and interested by Draco. Would still act as an antagonist I guess.

*Crabbe, Goyle & Bulstrode* : May be harsh to Bulstrode, but I always pictured her as a female Crabbe or Goyle. So a follower who doesn't talk much and do the dirty work of the boss (in the case, Pansy).

*Daphne Greengrass* : Typical spoiled girl. Grew up a Blood Purist, with parents supporter of the Dark Lord without being active participants. I would make her very friendly with Pansy and antagonist toward Harry more by sheep mentality than anything else. Though I would try to make her grow up in the later years (but it's probably because I really like Harry/ Daphne so she need to be redemnable). Also, I would definitively not make her a "Ice Queen" (I strongly dislike this persona and how most authors treat it).

*Tracey Davis* : In my headcanon, she is HalfBlood, and is very conscious of her blood status considering most of her year mates are children of very pure lines, and Blood Supremacist. "Friend" with Pansy and Daphne (and Milicent I guess), try to keep a low profil because the other girls regularly mock her for her blood (and the fact she her family would be middle class, compared to the Wealthy / Rich families of the others).

*Theodore Nott* : Son of a Death Eater, bookworm, pretty discret. I like to make him someone highly logical, which may lead him later to doubt Blood Purism (though he would still make himself vastly superious to muggles). In my headcanon, I make him friend to Harry because they both can stay together without feeling the need to fill the silence.

*Blaise Zabini* : Social Butterfly, managed to be friendly with just everyone. I would make him friend to Harry because he seek "excitment" and troubles just seem to follow Harry.

​

The characters of the Slytherin House would basically be divied into 3 "cliques", that would be divided like this (at least year 1) :\\
Harry Group : Harry, Theodore and Blaise\\
Draco Group : Draco, Crabe and Goyle\\
Pansy Gang : Pansy, Daphne, Milicent, Tracey

Draco would be very antagonist to Harry, and sometimes be helped by Pansy (even if she would care less to put Harry down).

​

Concerning *Snape* , I believe he is, deep down, a bitter man. I don't think having Harry in his house would make him change his mind about him, if anything he would be more annoyed to have him as HIS responsability (always been very sceptical of the whole "He is Lily son too, I should love it" trope). Yet, having Harry in his house would force him to change how he deal with him. He would not be able to take points from him without reason since it would hurt his house, so he would rather just ignore his very existence, just making some snide remarks her and there. Slytherin Harry should also be less (directly) conflicting which would help in the long run.

​

As for the Wizarding world in general, I guess they are stupid as usual. For example, while I doubt Ron would confront him yelling traitor after his sorting (a classic to bash Ron), I am convinced this confrontation would happen sooner or later with either a Gryffindor or a Huplepuff (Mc Laggen or Smith being the most likely to start it).

**** Absolutely, I think 'overly political kids' is definitely something to avoid.

Ron, I can see turning against Harry when he's sorted into Slytherin. At eleven years old, there's no denying he was pretty prejudiced against Slytherins, and his friendship with Harry would be too new to majorly change that, I'd imagine.

Quite a few of these stories do tend to have Harry befriending Hermione, surprisingly, usually for studying purposes at first.

As for the Slytherins, it sounds like you want to follow the 'fanon personalities' they have fairly closely. I don't think that's a bad idea, to be fair - it just helps readers to be more familiar with the characters, and lets them know what to expect. But I think authors should mix things up a little. Take Daphne, for example - what if she resents Astoria because of her blood malediction being a burden? Things like that could mix up the typical fanon characterisations, without throwing them out entirely.

Why would that Theo be siding with Harry, as a blood purist and son of a Death Eater? It seems to me as though it may make more sense to move him over to Draco's side, and bring Tracey to Harry's side - both are half-bloods, which may help them bond.

And every story needs more Cormac McLaggen.

***** I do like most of the fanon personalities. The only one that truly bother me is the "Ice Queen" Daphne, and mainly because I find it boring (every Slytherin are bad, except this girl that is too intelligent to be Blood Purist, and also she is incredibly beautiful, like not Veela level but just under it. Yet Harry never heard of her before 4th or 5th year, but will still manage to melt her frozen heart in like 2 weeks).

This is why I prefer a more "average" Daphne, and since I like redemptions arcs why not make her start as pretty bitchy. Having her resent Astoria could also work for this kind of characterisation, her maybe having her jealous because why she is spoiled by her parents, they dotes more on Astoria than on her.

​

For Theo, I don't really think that his father would be a problem, at first. I don't see Harry as someone who blame the children for the crimes of their parents, so he would not really have any special prejudice on this point. Also, I put his father in the same category than Lucius Malfoy, someone who disavowed Voldemort to save himself. Just as Lucius, he would wonder if Harry is a futur Dark Lord or not, so he would not be totally opposed to the friendship. Or courses their would be limitations, for example NOBODY would accept to let Harry spend the end of his summer at Theo house for obvious reason, but for the rest he would be fine.

The only true problem would come when Voldemort return at the end of GoF, but at that time, the characters should have matured at least a little, and their friendship would also be etablished enough to not be instantly cut by the return, but force characters to waver between sides and in the end make their own choices.

As for why they are friends, I created this as something that just happened. I believe that the first month (or months) of Harry at Hogwarts would not really be pleasant. A lot of Slytherin would be wary of him because of what happened when he was a baby, the other Houses would already paint him as a futur Dark Lord, and some aggressive students would just bully him (both self righteous idiots like McLaggen or baby Death Eaters like Draco). During this time, Harry spends a lot of time in the library, there he finds Theo who do not seem to care about his presence (would not flee if he sit next to him at least). Both would take the habit to read and study next to each other, not feeling forced to carry a conversation (unlike someone like Hermione may do). The rare time they talk, they have nice conversations about classes or magic in general. And even in Theo is a blood purist, he is a polite one (would try to avoid dangerous subject like blood purity or muggles when talking to Harry for example, and would never call Lily Potter a mudblood like Malfoy would do). At the same time Draco is his usal annoying self so Theo just try to stay clear of him, and when later Harry prove he can defend himself, Theo has no reason to side with Draco. I also want him to have some doubts about blood purity, and Harry would be one of the only one willing to even talk about it.

​

In Tracey case, she is an interesting character, and I want her to side with Harry group. But I placed the even in 4th year just to use the Yull Ball for it.\\
Basically, Harry is still the 4th Champion (that's one of the events that happen outside of his power, so I do not see him changing), after a good showing at the 1st Task, he is once again popular. At that time, he decides to play some House Politic.\\
In 4th year, Pansy is Draco's girlfriend (I guess), so they are both "together" against Harry making it a 7Vs3 fight. He plan to even the odds by "stealing" a girl of Pansy gang. At that time Daphne seem to already be interested in him, but he rather choose the discret Tracey, and (very publicly) invites her to the Ball. Tracey understand the plan, and (against a condition of her own), accept to go to the Ball, and even to become his "girlfriend". They rapidly understand that they do not work very well together and break up, but she still hang around with him and his friends (Theo and Blaise), openly joigning his group.

I rather like the rest of your analysis, but I don't understand this point. Harry being the 4th champion is dependent on Pettigrew escaping and deciding on seeking Voldemort, so obviously if he's killed or captured, this is not going to happen. And what happens with Pettigrew does depend on Harry to an extent. Even if the circumstances leading to the events in the Shrieking Shack occur in the same way (more than doubtful), a Harry with a different outlook might well decide not to spare Pettigrew. Or he would remember that it's the full moon and so prevent the escape of Pettigrew.

******* I guess it's true (though I kinda want to have him Champion because the Tournament will happen, and it seems to be a waste to not use it for a story).

​

But we can probably go even further with what you said, and wonder if Sirius Black would even escape Azkaban if Harry is in Slytherin.

After all, Sirius only escaped because he saw a picture of Pettigrew, and the events that lead to this are like this :

- Arthur wins the annual Ministry draw or something like that
- Arthur decides to use the money to go visit Bill in Egypt with his familly

​

So, while Arthur winning the draw doesn't have anything to do with Harry, and should probably happen in any scenario, the events of the CoS can impact on his decision to go to Egypt. Because, would a Slytherin Harry go into the chamber of Secrets to save Ginny? Would he even have any reason to save her even if he had the same informations than Canon?

A grieffing Weasley familly (who could also be struggling with legal troubles if Lucius plan to accuse Ginny for the Chamber worked) would probably not go to Egypt, and so Sirius would not have any reason to escape.

I guess it could be possible to "invent" one (like an article about how Harry almost died during the year, or how he dislike his home life) but I'm not sure it could work the same.

​

PS: Also, the whole year may be different with a Slytherin Harry. After all, if his true mark and the assumed one are in the same room, you could explain the mistake. But if there is the whole castle between them, people should wonder about his goal.

**** Wait, so literally everyone would hate Harry? The last few people you described we barely know anything about. Daphne is literally only mentioned by name. Yet you've listed out her life through your head canon, when you're trying to list everything out as how they would be in canon. Why would she be a typical snob that hangs off Pansy and hates Harry? Why would Blaise not be the exact same thing? His mother is a Femme Fatale in every sense. He'd be brought up to follow the same thing, and probably hate Harry too, by your reasonings for everyone else.

Slytherin wouldn't be unsafe for Harry until at least the end of the fourth book/movie. A Harry that ends up in Slytherin would probably follow a little more closer to them anyways. His relatives hate him and make it very much known, and then he'd spend nine months of the year surrounded by people that hate muggles. Because god forbid Slytherin have someone that isn't a Death Eater. Your group reasonings are pretty ridiculous once you pass the Brutes. Even then, they don't make much sense. Draco was acting like a spoiled brat, you know, how most children that age act. A Harry that ended up in Slytherin (because they're supposed to be cunning) would understand that he isn't Dudley, and probably try to make in roads to at least get Draco as a neutral in regards to how he acts towards Harry.

Or we can take your stance, and just throw canon out the window whenever we feel like it, and bring in our own head canons as fact when trying to talk about canon.

***** I did mention headcanon

Concerning Draco, you are right he is not Dudley, he manage to be worse. Draco is a Dudley who is even more spoiled by his parents, and that happens to have magic. In canon, Draco does not show himself as anything else than a spoiled Little child before HBP, when he litteraly has a sword of damocles over his head. Draco Malfoy is a bigot that was 100% for the extermination of muggleborns until he had to do it himself and learnt he didn't have the guts to do it.

But Harry would act neutraly him of course, he is kid that remind him of Dudley, who think his mother deserved to die and is stupid enough to say it in public, but Harry would be neutral toward him because he also think Muggles suck thanks to the Dursley.

Concerning Daphne Greengrass, the books only say his name. I'm pretty sure there is an interview where Rowling said she was a member of Pansy gang but it's an interview so not canon.

As for the "safety" of the House, I never said he would be killed in his bed. But is Head of House would hate his guts (because seriously, it's Snape) and his house would be the one where the children and nephezs of Azkaban convicts gather, none of them would make his life difficult?

*** I haven't read too many Slytherin Harry stories, including On the Way to Greatness. They very much fall into the indyHarry category for the most part.

I think Draco should still be an antagonist. I also think Harry would do his best to keep up his friendship with Ron, if only to spite Draco.

Snape should also remain an antagonist. Or have him flat out ignore Harry until the latter does something to fit Snape's world view of "arrogant like your father." Snape could be a catalyst for Harry shying away from Dumbledore. I had an idea once of Harry ending up at some Christmas dinner and meeting Fudge. He was going to whisper in his ear about the media blaming him for the low number of new aurors and healers when they should look at Hogwarts. He'd meet Umbridge 2-3 years earlier. Lucius would also jump on this to get Dumbledore fired, sacrificing Snape in the process.

This might motivate Dumbledore to take Harry under his wing.

**** Would Ron be interested in keeping Harry as a friend, do you think? I'm a big fan of Ron, and get really tired of Ron-bashing, but I can't picture eleven-year old Ron wanting to be friends with a slimy Slytherin. I don't think there's many stories that go down this route, but it could be interesting.

Draco as a rival for Harry is something I can definitely see though, especially if Harry still snubs him right before the Sorting. Then, there's potential - does it become such a bitter rivalry as in canon, or more of a friendly rivalry?

The risk to this approach, though, is that it squanders some of the potential that Harry being in Slytherin has, if his relationships are similar to canon. Fics that stick to the 'Stations of Canon' too closely can get pretty dull, once you've read a few of them.

I do think your ideas for the politicking side are interesting. Lucius seeing Harry's potential, I like that - though maybe he'd want to bring him into his fold as a useful tool, rather than having him become another Dark Lord? And Dumbledore being sacked would be pretty great - a lot of interesting divergences could happen from that point.

I'd argue that initially there should still be some rivalry between Draco and Harry, partly because (if memory serves me correctly) Harry's initial impression of Draco was something akin to "skinny Dudley", and it took Harry saving Dudley's life during the Dementor attack in OOTP, coupled with a lot of soul searching on Dudley's part, for the two of them to be anywhere near on friendly terms in Canon.

You're right about that, Harry's first reaction to Draco was to be reminded of Dudley.

A potential way around this is to have Harry meet Draco in different circumstances, and so end up with a better first impression. Another is to have an AU Draco - the /They Shook Hands/ series gives Draco an older brother, which makes him a better person.

  This approach opens up all sorts of questions - how will Lucius Malfoy react to his son befriending the ‘Boy Who Lived'?
#+end_quote

He'd be happy. According to Pottermore, Draco thought his father would like that, and Lucius thought Harry could be the next Voldemort

"Many different theories had been in circulation for years as to how Harry survived what should have been a lethal attack, and one of the most persistent was that Harry himself was a great Dark wizard. The fact that he had been removed from the wizarding community seemed (to wishful thinkers) to support this view, and Draco's father, wily Lucius Malfoy, was one of those who subscribed most eagerly to the theory. It was comforting to think that he, Lucius, might be in for a second chance of world domination, should this Potter boy prove to be another, and greater, pure-blood champion. It was, therefore, in the knowledge that he was doing nothing of which his father would disapprove, and in the hope that he might be able to relay some interesting news home, that Draco Malfoy offered Harry Potter his hand when he realised who he was on the Hogwarts Express. "

Ignoring Pottermore, to the rest of the Wizarding he would seem like a Good man that definatly gave up his old ways. Not only does he constantly Donate, his son even became friends with the Saviour of Magical Britain. Furthermore, he could always use Harry for both political and Monetary gain.

#+begin_quote
  Will these friends stick by Harry when Voldemort returns?
#+end_quote

That depends on how well Harry has befriended them. Overall, even though Draco wished for Voldemort to win (or was raised to think this way "Draco was raised in an atmosphere of regret that the Dark Lord had not succeeded in taking command of the wizarding community, although he was prudently reminded that such sentiments ought not to be expressed outside the small circle of the family and their close friends ‘or Daddy might get into trouble' ", if Harry can convince him that Voldemort might be pissed at his father(the diary Lucius was supposed to protect, not looking for him, not furthering his cause,ect), and that Lucius' best interest lies with the "Light" (After all, not only they have Dumbledore, but also Harry who defeated Voldemort as a baby), Draco might then convince Lucius to defect/ask Harry to help kidnapp his family for safety.

What do you mean? "Dragged down" as in converted to their view point?

#+begin_quote
  What opportunities can these characters offer?
#+end_quote

That depends. Daphne being a pureblood witch could help him learn how to act properly in society, help him learn how to make connections. Tracey, being a half blood witch could be a nice contrast to Daphne(depends on her situation with her family). Maybe even teach Harry some Wizarding games like Wizard's Chess. Blaise could help Harry learn to manage finances. His mother certainly knew how to "Blaise Zabini was the son of a famously beautiful witch who had been widowed seventimes over by 1996. Each husband's deathoccurred both under suspicious circumstances and left the already wealthy Ms. Zabini and her son with more money.". He could also teach Harry about Wizarding sports as well.

** There's no doubt that the Harry we see in canon is a Gryffindor - but that's not to say that he doesn't have Slytherin traits.

An ambitious Harry is certainly an interesting avenue to explore. There's several angles that this could be approached from - does Harry want to live up to his reputation, as the ‘Boy Who Lived' and the son of James and Lily? Does he want to forge his own reputation, one that's purely his own and his doing? Or does he perhaps want to thrive to spite the Dursleys, and all the others who looked down on him?

Harry does show signs of cunning in canon - the go-to example is probably him tricking Lucius Malfoy into freeing Dobby, though there's plenty more. Sorting Harry into Slytherin gives authors a chance to explore this side of his character, which would be able to - and almost /need/ to - grow in that environment.

Then you've got the parallels between Harry and Voldemort - both half-bloods, both ‘orphaned' and unloved by the muggles who raised them, both sorted into Slytherin; and of course, further bound together by the horcrux in Harry's scar. Canon teased us with these parallels, but never fully developed them. How might they be developed in a Slytherin Harry story? Might Harry's hate for the Dursleys develop into a bigoted attitude towards muggles as a whole? Would Harry fall down a darker path, or still develop into a good person?

What are you thoughts?

*** As you said, having a Slytherin Harry leave a lot of liberty about his character, since you can't use the one of Canon that is deeply Gryffindorish. But I think some points would stay not matter what approach you take. For example, A Slytherin Harry would probably appreciate the Slug Club, if only for the possibility of Networking it brings. He would also be more conscious of the potential his fame has, and be more willing to use it to further his goal (unlike canon Harry that hate everything in link to his fame).

​

Il also really the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But I think it is mainly the difference that could be drawn from these parallels that could be interesting.

For example, Tom Riddle struggled (at first) because of his unknow parentage, while Harry struggle because of his too well known parentage. Or Tom Riddle chose to forsake his Muggle origins, while Harry defend his and the name of Lily Potter.

​

Finally, considering the Dursley, in my Headcanon, Harry develop a bit of prejudice. He doesn't "hate" the Dursley, but despise them. He decided he was "indebted" toward them because they took him in, and is paying it off (by doing chores in the summer), but he also decided that the second he is an adult (and the wards fall, though he learn of it later), he would leave the Dursley and never seek them ever again. There life (or death) would have nothing to do with him.

For the rest of the Muggles, I make him a little prejudiced. Not "all Muggles must die or be slaves at my feets!", but more "I have Magic, they don't. I could talk to one from time to time but I have no interest toward them in general".

** They Shook Hands is by far my favorite fanfiction. I think it only needs little in terms of detail and worldbuilding to be considered on the same level of scope and quality as the original content. Always considered it weird that it is so rarely recommended on this subreddit.

*** It used to be a favourite of mine, actually, but I've gone off of it recently. For one, the first few years don't diverge all that much from canon, so I struggle to get through them - especially considering they're all full-length. And also, I think it falls too much into switching Slytherin and Gryffindor, switching Ron and Draco, etcetera.

With that said, I do recall Year Four and onwards being pretty great? Just haven't read them for years.

** I'm a big fan of Slytherin!Harry fics and I think a lot of good points have been made about the variations the theme can have.

I personally think that starting with the sorting there are three main approaches. Practically Canon, Almost Canon, and AU.

Of the three I tend to prefer Practically Canon and AU. In a Practically Canon fic, the only changes prior to sorting are the Hats insistence on placing Harry in Slytherin or Harry somehow avoiding the Anti-Slytherin experiences he has before the sorting, leading him to a situation in which he doesn't insist on "not Slytherin". This gives a great opportunity to explore how canon Harry would react to being in Slytherin and how canon Slytherins would react to him. A good point of departure with many routes to explore.

AU is great as well, with a significant enough difference in Harry's childhood to make Slytherin appealing. Whether that be being raised by purebloods, hating muggles, or whatever. Prince of Slytherin comes to mind in that Harry's sorting is no surprise given his characterization prior to sorting.

The Almost Canon fics are the weakest ones in my mind, where Harry is canon up until age 10 or whatever where he has an "experience" and decides he needs to be more sneaky and ambitious and generally Slytherin without even knowing that is what he is doing. This in my mind is mostly just poor writing and comes across as an author rushing through to where their story really begins in their mind and giving a justification for their changes to Harry rather than making them feel organic. Maybe I'm just biased against sudden realizations as points of departure though.

** I agree that the main question with Slytherin!Harry is about his relationships with other people. That's one of the most interesting aspects to explore in the genre as well. I have some opinions on the theme.

I will start this saying that I am partial to huge canon divergences/AUs (if I want to read canon, I will read canon), but a few things that I enjoy reading, and therefore maintain similar to canon in my writing, are:

- Harry is still a half-blood raised in the muggle world, whether or not by the Dursleys;

- At some point, Lily and James need to have opposed Voldemort;

- Particularly, Lily is still a muggleborn (changing her blood status is something that bothers me);

- Slytherin is hugely populated by blood purists - which doesn't mean it needs to be the only house like that ;)

That makes Harry mostly a figure that will not be very accepted in Slytherin - especially if there is no prophecy, and he's just "another half-blood". And if there is still the BWL thing, Harry having defeated Voldemort as a baby can be used to justify people thinking he's very powerful and associating with him because of that, but I'll doubt that this would be an uniform mentality.

This is a good scenario for conflicts, and gives Harry motivation to become a great wizard (because he either wants to prove himself, get revenge, or both). It deviates from the "Harry is still a halfblood, and Slytherins are still mostly blood purists, but they love Harry because of reasons" scenario.

I think that another non pureblood in Slytherin becoming friends with Harry has a lot of potential. There enters Tracey Davis.

According to Pottermore, Tracey Davis is a half-blood. Due to that, and to being mostly a blank slate, I think that her character has a lot of potential in the genre: She too is a non pureblood in Slytherin, and both she and Harry can see advantage in their association - to avoid bullying, to study/train together, etc. Tracey is someone that I wanted to include in my own Slytherin Harry story, but due to the nature of the AU, other characters ended up taking precedence. But I still want to see a Harry and Tracey become great wizards/better than their Slytherin peers and prove that blood supremacy is bullshit.

This ended up a bit disorganized, and thers's more I want to say, but maybe I'll come back when I'm less busy.

** With Slytherin Harry, I think one reason why there is no defining story is that there are just too many different directions you can take it. "Slytherin Harry" isn't really a plot in itself, it's more of a single story element which can be used in a number of combinations.

I think you've got two main fulcrums here:

- Setting

- Harry's character

With setting, you can take either (a) the "butterfly effect" approach where the setting is identical to canon and we just see how things are different because of the different sorting, or (b) the AU approach where the fundamental set up of the world/story is changed.

It's common for the AU approach to add some nuance to pure-blood supremacy (e.g. taking it in a direction that's more akin to an anti-immigration stance than a racial supremacy stance) and to substantially alter the political set-up of magical Britain (magical nobility etc.).

With Harry's character, you can (a) keep him as his canon self, and therefore something of a black sheep within Slytherin, or (b) write an AU Harry where he is more in line with his Slytherin peers. Or you can go even more AU and write a fem!Harry (cough).

So you have four basic stories that can be told:

1. Canon Harry in canon world, where the only difference is him being sorted into Slytherin, with a focus on the realistic consequences of that change.

2. AU Harry in canon world, where the focus is likely going to be Harry in some form of tension with his canonical allies as he goes down the path of becoming a dark wizard.

3. Canon Harry in an AU world. Don't think I've ever seen this one, but the focus would be similar to 1, just even more extreme because of the AU changes which make pure-blood society even more different to Muggle society.

4. AU Harry in an AU world. This is probably the most common Slytherin!Harry story.

*** You're right that there are so many different possibilities with Slytherin Harry.

I think in general, it's best to have at least some AU elements introduced. Blood Purists from Canon simply don't have much nuance and are, well, bad people. If you're going to be writing a story where they play a major part, and not purely as villains, that needs to be changed. Sometimes, canon needs to take a back seat to the story being told - Rowling told us a 'Good vs Evil' story, broadly speaking, but the universe that required isn't so suited to a 'Shades of Grey' story.

The choice between a canon and AU Harry is a tricky one, though - both can be fantastic. /On The Way to Greatness/, for example, is very highly rated - though not my cup of tea - and uses a 'Canon Harry', and a point of divergence at the Sorting; whereas your story goes fully AU with a female Harry, and has been very good so far. I remember the first version, and thinking it was an interesting character piece. That's the potential an AU Harry offers.
