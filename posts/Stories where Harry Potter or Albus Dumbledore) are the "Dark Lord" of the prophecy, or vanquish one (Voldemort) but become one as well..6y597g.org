Basically I am looking for stories with a bit of a flip on the prophecy. As we all know the prophecy is open to much interpretation:

#+begin_quote
  The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches ... Born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies ... And the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not ... And either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives ...
#+end_quote

--------------

I am interested in fan fiction where one of these things happens (or at least something similar)

1. Harry Potter defeats the dark lord (Voldemort or Dumbledore) but becomes somewhat of a grey or dark lord himself, understanding of course that such terms as grey, dark, or light are open to interpretation.

2. Dumbledore is actually the dark lord of the prophecy for whatever reason, and Harry must defeat him.

3. Harry potter is the dark lord in the prophecy somehow (but wins against Vold/Dumbles), and either the prophecy is still pending or is resolved with just the opposite side to cannon lore winning in essence.

   --------------

Keep in mind of course that the prophecy never says who wins. Simply that 2 people have the power to vanquish the other (and the term vanquish is open to interpretation as well).

Other requests: I would prefer if there is at least some sort of relationship/romance/lemon aspect to the story. I would prefer no main character slash. I would prefer Mature or higher ratings as the idea behind these stories seems to imply the need for language, violence, sex, or simply darker topics.

Thank you!


** Sum of Their Parts linkffn(11858167 ) fits your criteria, I believe. After the Ministry attempts to pass discriminatory laws against werewolves, Harry realizes that nothing has changed. He realizes that the greatest catalyst for change is a Dark Lord, so he takes up the mantle. With him are Ron and Hermione, and together they work to enact progress through violence and death, where peace failed.

It's one of my favorite fictions of all the time. The ending is a bit lacking, but not because of a dip in quality. I hope you enjoy.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

*** To be fair, that's less what he's looking for... I think he's looking more for a truly despicable character, not the 'ends justify the means' antihero.

*** That was a fun little read, although it had some flaws. Flaws that would or could easily be fixed if it was developed out some. Its still shocking to me there are not more stories in this vain but longer and with world building or at least well developed plot.

** I know of one where Harry goes a bit crazy after defeating Voldemort and is working in the Department of Mysteries. It's really dark and AU. And personally I think he's really OOC. But I love everyone else's characterisation.

Let me try and find it!

*** I am a bit surprised there are not more fan fics that explore with the open nature of the prophecy. Even if its not exactly like I described, the prophecies flexible nature should be a great starting point for ideas.

**** Yes. I didn't realise anyone was paying attention. I have hit a bit of a road block due to events in my life (weddings and other big events) but I will be back on to it soon. I don't want to post something to ff.net if it isn't finished as I have already gone back and changed things several times so that I maintain consistency.

****** I haven't been able to find much in the way of good, Slytherin stories either. Most fall to pieces which is why I am reluctant to post without making sure mine won't.

I haven't actually thought about going on DLP. Is it an active community?

I wouldn't mind proof readers who can pick out unneeded fluff. I have siblings who love Harry Potter and love English grammar who have picked out spelling errors in what I have got so far, but they struggle with being brutal with plot. If I post in the WBA section of DLP, is that the best place to go for proof readers and structural advice (yourself included)?
