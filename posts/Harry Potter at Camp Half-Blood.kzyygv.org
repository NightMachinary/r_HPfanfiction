Harry Potter is found by a saytar (or something else, I'm not picky) and brought to camp half-blood. He'd likely have to get there before (spoiler) Thalia sacrifices herself to make the protection around camp half-blood seeing as he isn't actually a half-blood, unless you'd like to make him one? It doesn't have to be a bashing fic, but I'd prefer it if Harry can't get his letter until far later because the owls can't get through the protection around camp, or because the teachers can't get through the protections.

Honestly, so long as Harry goes to camp, I'm happy with it. The only request I have is that no other â€˜main characters' or teachers from Harry Potter are thought to be half-bloods or are half-bloods. For example, Ron, Luna, and Hermione, can't be half-bloods, however Dean Thomas, Cedric Diggory, and honestly any other supporting characters can.

Please no Drarry, Harry/Luna, Harry/Ron, Harry/Hermione, or Harry/any teachers! He can be friends with anyone, and shipped with anyone else of any gender! He can also be in any Hogwarts house if he does end up at school. Sorry if I seem a bit picky, but I simply don't like those ships.


** It's a shame that Percy Jackson doesn't have many good fics; I adore the series.

*** Yea, I think its mainly due to the fanbase being on the younger side. Though I will recomend linkffn(son of the western sea) as the absolute best fic in the fandom.

  All myths are true. Outside the borders of Western Civilization lies the rest of the world. After the Second Olympian War, a restless Percy Jackson sails for the horizon, and never stops. AU after The Last Olympian. Percy x various mythological figures, het and slash.

**** You mean PJO focuses a lot on the canon ships?

I agree. It's a shame because some of those really do have the potential. I mean, if someone gave me and idea, I'd totally write a fic for PJ; that fandom comes before HP for me.

PJ is a younger crowd, I think.

**** While that is annoying, I feel like the bigger problem is the complete lack in plot variety. It seems like the vast majority of the fics I've seen use the same few plots:

- Percy is betrayed by everyone, gets strong, and comes back to overthrow everyone who betrayed him.

- Guardian of the Hunt and other forced Percy/Artemis plots.

- High school, coffee shop, and weird soul mate AUs.

And maybe one or two others that are slipping my mind, but I think that's about it.

And it might be fine if you enjoy those types of stories, but I got very tired of the first two after reading them a few times, and the third has never held any interest for me.

*** Ugh, I tried reading this because it was so frequently recc'd, and I didn't finish it. It was just so... boring. Maybe it's because I'm not a huge fan of the Percy Jackson series (nothing wrong with it, it just didn't resonate with me), but it's a long, child-focused fic without any real stakes beyond one or two scenes. It's just child Harry flouncing around the Percy Jackson universe and nothing interesting happens.
