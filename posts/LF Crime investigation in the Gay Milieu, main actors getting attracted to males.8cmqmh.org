Harry and/or Ron are ordered to investigate a Crime scene in a Gay Milieu. One of those is guiding them into this Etablisment. With continuing progress Harry and Ron begin to feel attracted to their Gender and so with themselfes, including their Guide-Person. They begin on having an affair with each other (whether just the two of them or a Threesome), possible just Ron/new person or Harry/new Person with "infidelity/jealousy" as they detect the affair of their Partner.

Doesnt matter if they are married to their Canon-partners or completely single. It actually doesnt even matter if its Harry and Ron, so it can also be Draco and some other, but i prefer the first ones.

The "attraction" comes is a natural way, so ny hypnosis, mind manipulation, drugs, etc.

But im open for alternatives, if my description is to detailed.


** I can't help you, but I have to ask:

What's a Milieu, gay or otherwise?

*** you know the Redlight Milieu? or blackmarket. I have to admit, it might sound a bit strange, but i meant with Milieu like Gay clubs or the gay society or something
