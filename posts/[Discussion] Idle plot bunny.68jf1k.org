Had a random plot bunny pop into my mind.

Salazar Slytherin had his tongue cut out as a young teen. Using dark magic, he created a Basilisk using the techniques of Herpo the Foul. He then used more dark magic to merge the baby snake with his ruined tongue. This allowed him to speak again, but also gave him the ability to speak Parseltongue, which incidentally gains that name from him. The snake was charmed to not grow, but remained more or less in it's form, sort of like Medusa, but in the mouth. After the infamous argument between Gryffindor and Slytherin, Salazar built the Chamber of Secrets, to be his tomb. He then sacrificed his life to leave his consciousness inside his statue in the Chamber, and left his real body inside the mouth which held the Basilisks lair. He died, and the Basilisk then was released from the body, but still linked to the statue. That is why when the Basilisk is summoned, it emerged from the mouth, like an obscene tongue. It is a tongue, and it is how the spirit of Slytherin communicates with any who enter the Chamber. Consider also the words to summon it.

"Speak to me Slytherin, greatest of the Hogwarts four."

You aren't telling a snake to come out and say high, you are literally addressing an ostensibly dead Founder, and asking for a chat. Then the snake comes out. Like a tongue, which can only speak to Slytherin's descendents.

Anyway, just a little plot bunny, cause I got caught up in the tongue symbolism.


** Okay. That is cool. Not sure how it'd work for a full story but for an awesome bit of world building/surprise twist thing, it's great.

** So Voldie enslaved, drove mad, and caused the death of his ancestor, then?

*** If Slytherin was already insane from staring at a wall for 1000 years, then I could see it. Especially if Riddle didn't realize what was happening.
