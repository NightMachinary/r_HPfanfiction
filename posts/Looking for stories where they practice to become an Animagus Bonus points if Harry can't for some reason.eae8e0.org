No really random, rare, multiple Animagus Forms please.

It's not easy to become one, so show it that they are practicing.

Not everyone can become one, so show just some people becoming one.

Bonus points if Harry for some reason can't become one, though it's not necessary.

NO Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione

No Lord Potter-Malfoy-Weasley-Gryffindor. No Harem Harry. Harry MUST be on the LIght Side.

No Dumbledore and/or Weasley Bashing Please. And if there is, please let it be believable and not For The Greater Good Dumbledore or Weasleys are using Harry.

AM fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

It's fine if Harry can become one, but yeah, just bonus points if he can't for whatever reason.


** Haha just had an image of Harry transforming into a half Raven half snake thing because of the scarcrux
