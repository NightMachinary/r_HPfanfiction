**** Definitely [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366/chapters/13756558][face death in the hope]] by LullabyKnell is slightly slash, but the story itself is well written enough that it isn't overbearing. This is a time travel fic where 17 year old Harry saved Regulus before he was drowned. He than meets his parents and others.

***** Just curious but what do you qualify as slight slash? Im assuming it doesn't get too graphic in the romantic sense then? I have no problem with it but don't usually tend to read stories where the main pairing is slash. This story idea really intrigues me though so I might give it a go.

****** Slight slash being that it is not totally focused the romantic side of things, but enough that I would still notice. Though the author hint it may happen, so yeah, I think it would happen. And I'm totally okay with it as well. I think their relationship is cute and feels real to them in terms of growth.

******* Ok. Maybe I'll give it a shot. It's not usually my thing but hey... we'll see. I'm mostly just craving to see him interact with his parents hopefully

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

  Vague spoilers for PS-HBP. One-shot. James Potter observes as Harry arrives to an alternate dimension where his parents are alive and Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived. Trying to teach old cliches new tricks, here.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.
