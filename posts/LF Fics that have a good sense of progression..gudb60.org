I'm looking for fics that, within a long or short (Preferably long) period of time, Harry finally finds his way, and becomes powerful as fuck. Fics that are just magical instant wish fulfillment, harem of 20 million wives, plain boring or anything of that sort- need not apply.

Here's some music for while your search. "Mint Jams" By Cassiopeia.


** FILFY teacher - linkffn(12772385) - Highschool Dxd crossover - Sounds like almost exactly what you want. Plenty of beautiful girls, always interesting, plenty of action along with softer scenes to balance that out. Harry making his way to amazingly powerful.

#+begin_quote
  A Harry Potter who has tried to take control of his destiny from second year on finds himself in need of a fresh start due to his marital status changing abruptly. Armed with some abilities beyond the norm, a Mastery of Defense and a muggle-style teacher's license, Harry takes his daughter Lily Luna and takes a job offer at Kuoh Academy. Pairings undecided save Harry/Rias/many?
