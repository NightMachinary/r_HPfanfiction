Has anyone come across any good fics that have the students retried for sorting before their 7th (or other) year? I was thinking about how as an 11-year-old I identified with Hufflepuff so much. Yet by the time I was graduating high school, I was such a different person and what I valued had changed so much.

I'm not concerned about particular pairings, though I will disclaim nothing with Snape, please.


** I believe the arithmancer had a scene where Hermione was resorted after she came back from Beauxbatons. She had a conversation with the Sorting Hat about how she had changed as a person.
