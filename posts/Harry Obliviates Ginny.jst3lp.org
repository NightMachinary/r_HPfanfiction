:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi I read a fic a while back where Harry comes late to hogwarts like in his 5th or 6th year, I remember him acting like Tom Riddle as he manipulated people. I think her merged with the soul piece of Voldemort. He seduces an innocent Ginny and when she talks to him about meeting her mother so they can gt engaged I think, he Obliviates her. And Harry also screwed Lavender on the side. He was dark and borderline evil. Hope someone remembers this fic...


** It was a fic by an author called "odev" and has been deleted. I /think/ (not positive on this) that it was titled "Solace in Shadows" or something like that.
