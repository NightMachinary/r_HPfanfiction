** It's awful. Rape is quite possibly the worst plot device and does /nothing/ for a story. I'm not sure why anyone would want to write this, let alone read this. Some things are really best left inside of your heard.

**** It doesn't provide realism. It's fanfiction, words on a page. No amount of fanciful writing will take away the fact that it would be used as a prop, a plot point used in an attempt to make a story seem grittier or darker, when all it will actually do is make it seem shallow and fake.

** ...What's the point? Aside from the rape, I mean. All I see coming from this storyline is angstwank and possibly suicide, which is /really/ not something I like to think about, much less read. If you're writing a fetish fic, then, well, that's that. But if you're trying for something more, then I'll be blunt and say that it's been done better and with more taste by published authors, and I can't really appreciate any fanfic written on the topic. I'm not saying published work is automatically better than fanfiction or anything like that, I'm just saying amateur fanfiction is a really bad medium for a topic with this much gravity and stigma attached.

But if it's just a fic about rape fetish, all I can tell you is that this is not the place for it. Not wanted, and barely if at all tolerated.

** I don't mean this in a disparaging way or anything, but... /why/? What could writing this possibly do to further your aims/goals as an author? Rape as a plot device is questionably valid, even if there could certainly be a better way to introduce conflict, but as a centrepiece doesn't make much sense.

*** Because I want to show how vicious the Carrows, as Death Eaters, could potentially be whilst whey are involved in the running of Hogwarts.

I mean, if they can resort to Unforgivables as punishment, then rape isn't too far off. Especially as at least one of the Slytherin Seventh years is a marked DE.

** Been there, done that;

#+begin_quote
  OFC is kinda on the side of light during a time when purebloods can get away with shit at Hogwarts. During a mission to liberate Pansy Parkinson from being punished by senior Slytherins, OC is caught by the Slytherins and is placed in their hidden punishment room.

  Inspired by OFC's young and healthy anatomy, the male contingent of Slytherins from the Quidditch squad, having been given the impression that they are almighty, assemble in the hidden room where they try to viciously rape her.

End result: Holly cut team captain Flint's brain out of his head. She was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and sent to Azkaban for a short stint.
