The canon closed-loop situation is.. confusing. H&H time traveled because they got through the night thanks to their time traveling which they were able to do because they got through the night thanks to their... you get the point.


** If you re-read and pay close attention, the following becomes clear:

1. Time-turners take you BACK IN TIME. Not parallel universe, no simulations, but actual time travel.

2. From what we are told by Hermione: Terrible things happen to wizards that meddle with time. Therefore, this means time can be malleable for wizards via time travel.

3. The only way to safely time travel is closed loop. That way, the loop was always there, protecting the traveler from erasing him or herself.

Posted from phone while putting in that sweet overtime or else I would expand on these points.

*** More for point 2 - people can be unborn, and you age during the travel. Eloise Mintumble experienced rapid catastrophic aging, caused people to not have been born, and affected the passing of present time. (Old Pottermore writing on time turners)

**** Yep. Messing with time is a bad idea. That's why you should only do closed loop, so you don't screw things up.

*** I think you can change thing without risking to "break time" if you don't know happened for sure. For example when Harry and Hermione saved Buckbeak there thought he was dead but they had no real proof as, if I remember well, they only heard something that made them think he was killed.

You could also change thing you think you know happened if you hide the change to be discovered only after your return to "normal time". For example if you want to save Sirius from going through the Veil, you can by catching him before he falls and showing an illusion of it to the people of "that time". Like this you still have a reason to go back in time and you'll know where he's hiding and people will discover it later.

If you go back you have to live the time until you are again in the present you left (if you pop back in the present, time will most likely catch up to you. Not a problem for some hours, more if it's some years or more).

As said, the reason for it is to avoid paradox where you don't have a reason to actually go back. And also you can't be seen. It is, in my opinion, the only way in HP to go back in time *without risking time problems*. I specify this because as mentioned by other you can go and change things without this "rules" (more like guidelines really) but you risk yourself and/or others (like the Eloise Mintumble case).

** I'd say it's a closed loop with Novikov's self consistency principle (no matter what Hermione says about people before her time traveling). That basically means you can't create a paradox (which here is defined as something that would keep your past self from traveling back and doing the same thing you did. Older Harry cast a patronus that his younger version saw. That's something he could not change. And they also had to save Buckbeak and Sirius in a way that their younger selfs would not know about and would still go back and do the same stuff again.

*** This is how I feel about it, too. The only reason they would give a Time Machine to a child is if the Turner itself could not create paradoxes. You can get extra sleep, pass yourself notes, etc. but you can't go back in time to stop yourself from going back in time. You can't change anything that's already happened, but you just have more time.

If we are thinking of parallel-dimensional stuff, then I think it's a moot argument because there's really no difference between a closed-loop single reality and an alternate reality without paradoxes.

** Canon implies that time travel, at least by using time turners, is a closed-loop. Presumably there are other ways to travel back in time that are unsafe, hence the proverb "Terrible things happen to wizards that meddle with time".

In my headcanon, the universe self-corrects to avoid paradoxes. That is, you can change history to some extent, but not to the point where you would invoke a paradox -- the universe rights itself in such a way that you /always/ travelled back in time with the knowledge you had before and after travel staying the same.

That being said, I have nothing against stories that portray time travel differently if it makes for a better story. Hell, I have one planned myself -- but not with Time Turners.

EDIT: Thinking about it a bit more, one interesting interpretation of the proverb above ("terrible things happen...") is that the people who meddled with time presumably ended up in a divergent universe, vanishing from the timeline they came from. Thus, something "terrible" happened from the point of view of people in the main timeline, since from their point of view, the person completely vanished.

** Everything you do whilst 'in the past' has already happened, and you were always the one to do it. The nature of Harry Potter time travel is that you can only 'change' things that you don't know the original outcome of (i.e. Buckbeak).

** Methods of Rationality says that things stay as simple as possible. So, you can have a closed causal loop, but only if, in the absence of that loop, you would eventually time-turn anyway for some reason, causing things to go differently, causing your first self to time-turn differently...and what actually happens is whatever would be the consistent end state of all those iterations.

Eg at one point, Harry devises a scheme to guess any password or combination in a single step, by essentially passing information from his time-turned self to the original. And what results is instead of the expected information, he gets the written message DO NOT MESS WITH TIME. Which he then, fearfully, passes back to his original self.

** I think time travel works the same way as divination, things that you know happened will still happen but they could happen in a wildly different way. Just like things predicted by divination will also happen but it could happen way differently than you thought. I think it's probably the same time magic at the core of both.

** I think you need to start looking at magic as a more complex energy. When time travelling magic is compelling you to keep the time line the same making it difficult to cause problems. If you were to try and donsomething that did not already happen magic would stop you perhaos even making you unconcious until time has caught back up.

*** So when they used the time-turner.. they hopped into a parallel reality and saved their alternate selves? I guess that means that there's a single universe where they just vanished out of existence?
