Clichéd plotlines/elements/tropes don't necessarily make fics unpalatable. Hell, they can even be great in the hands of the right author.

But what's /the/ HP fanfiction dead horse for you? What's the overused storyline or plot element you've seen done poorly so many times you'll categorically refuse to read anything involving it? (Personally, I haven't yet read enough fics to grow tired of any particular trope, so I'm curious to see what you guys think.)


** "Harry goes on a shopping spree!"

Where he buys black jeans that ride low on his hips, a tight black t-shirt, and probably gets his ears pierced.

You have ALL read this scene. Don't deny it! He will probably buy about 10 snakes too, and maybe something exotic like a talking tiger.

**** It's never a major point in the few stories that include it, but in those stories Harry is super jaded by Snape and walks out of class then finds Pomfrey and says teach me, a better way of doing it to make Harry ask Dumbledore to be instructed privately or by another capable instructor. I mean sure the school nurse might know quite a bit about potions, but healing and teaching are two different things, if she taught a potions course then asking to be switched into her class wouldn't be a terrible choice either, but I imagine a realistic system would still require Dumbledore's approval.

Honestly this occurs rarely enough it's not really a cliché, but I've seen it occur exactly the same way probably 4 or 5 times on stories with over a thousand favorites, the scenario has a few glaring issues in it that are easy to fix, which stuck with me well after reading them.

**** Well, nothing wrong with that inherently, but I will point out that for all his vitriol Snape likely asked all three questions only because Harry did not know answers to any and likely would have stopped the moment Harry actually could answer any of the questions he asked, so “Harry answers all three of Snape's questions” is kind of a minor station of the canon. Of course even good fics have that in occasionally (like “Seventh Horcrux”), but there's the difference between it being played for the comedy value (like in the above one) and it being played to show how Harry is oh-so-splendid-and-grand whilst Snape is the worst teacher ever and then some.

Not to mention that the whole scene has been redone so many times already that making another rendition of it just to show how great Harry must be for knowing something you'd know if you opened your Potions textbook ... well, either add something that makes the scene new (new questions, or a commentary like in “Seventh Horcrux”), or just give the readers the summation that “stuff happens” instead of writing another nigh-identical to already existing stuff that really serves no sensible purpose (amusingly, and I will use the same story as an example again, in “Seventh Horcrux” it does actually fulfil the purpose of showing some of Harry's ... mental issues, and his approach to the point system, which means the scene is not senseless in it; but if you used it to show how the character is overall oh-so-great then you wouldn't need that scene in particular so senseless it could and likely would be).

**** I think the issue is that you aren't thinking how making Harry ambidextrous is normally used, but how you plan on using it. Typically it's a cliché, meaning it has no purpose for the story at all and could be removed from the story without any effort. Honestly I believe a lot of authors actually make Harry ambidextrous and forget they did exactly that by the time they finish whatever paragraph they're typing.

Now if somehow you make it relevant to the plot, say he's a famous duelist known for using two wands or something then it would be fair to include in my opinion, but I won't hold my breath as I've never seen it relevant, I can't actually think of a way to make ambidextrousness a defining character trait or plot point other than the example I listed.

**** Not all stories actually include super cliché content, if they did no one would read fanfiction as cliché content is just using someone else's idea in your story. Originality is great, copying someone else to inflate the size of updates that include zero plot is bad.

Many authors make Harry ambidextrous in their stories, yet the only time this is ever mentioned is when Harry buys a wand, never again in the story. That was a prime example of a shitty cliché that tons of authors use that makes absolutely no sense, I bet they can't even explain why he needs to be ambidextrous for the story. The reason is because someone thought that would be a cool ability for a story, probably more than a decade ago, and a bunch of authors read the same story and liked the idea, so they included it but didn't want to make it relevant to the plot as that's hard work, so Harry is given a pointless ability, then more authors repeat the process continuing a vicious cycle of pointless cliché abilities.

Let me tell you a little secret about every cliché I listed in Diagon Alley, every single one of them is easily removable, just don't write the scene unless you need to for plot or character development, if Harry needs to meet Draco Malfoy start the scene just before Harry meets Draco and end it after Draco leaves. The entire scene normally is just a cluster fuck of cliché content as authors think they need the scene.

And to answer your question, actually I do read stuff with cliché content, I just enjoy original stuff more. Most really AU stuff is a lot more fun for someone like me.

The same goes for Hogwarts, it is always described as huge, the ceiling always has stars when they first come in, kinda disappointing every time I see it. Have you ever read God Amongst Men? It has lots of cliches but does them right usually, Harry is ambidextrous, but it is later revealed that due to this he can use two wands at the same time. It was actually pretty clever IMO, as I've never seen dual-wielding wands before.

I've been going through sections of fanfiction and exhausting them for maybe a year now, I just read anything I see recommended here that seems fun.

I'll give it credit for trying to make ambidextrous Harry relevant, still I would love to see a story where an author makes a plot point that absolutely requires Harry to be ambidextrous as I can't think of anything that realistically would require that or at least makes the fact he is relevant often enough that it's not just a pointless ability.

I can't recall where but I remember a story where Harry had a twin (can't remember the gender) and Voldemort decided to pull out a second wand and use the killing curse on both of them simultaneously, I'm pretty sure it was a vampire Harry story.

Also speaking of pointless details, stories that include the Hat's song first year, when I first started reading I hated that more than anything.

**** Often stories have Harry act either like a giant ass to Goblins which everyone is like 'Wtf are you doing Harry?' and it turns out that's the right thing to do but no wizard knew it. Or he acts polite and gets better service, and the story implies no one but Harry ever thought to do that. Still that was more of an opinion thing as I dislike both of those depictions, I prefer the goblins are a species of pests depiction who will overrun the planet if not killed. Also I just realized I forgot to say how stupid a Gringotts credit card would be on that list.

I probably should have merged those two lines about the books, still often it seems like authors imagine Harry can learn everything a few text books have without any practice and just by reading them over the summer. Put it like this I can study my physics books all I want, unless I actually practice I won't get any better at the math, I figure the same is true of magic.

Honestly the handshake scene is pure cringe often. There are people I fucking hate who I've had to shake their hands, none of my friends would go "You bastard! You shook his hand!" Ron has an overly strong reaction that Harry is willing to shake someone's hand. It could probably be discounted though since they are eleven. Also I really doubt the houses would have anything more than a sports rivalry in a realistic world.

About the hall shutting up, Harry Potter sounds like he is a wizarding bed time story, it's not like everyone had heard of him before Hogwarts, see muggleborns. So muggleborn students would clap, I imagine some people wouldn't really be paying attention and would clap, etc... Everyone actually knowing who he is and not clapping sounds unrealistic.

For the Ravenclaw common room, in stories where they use the knocker Harry is always the one to figure out the riddle unless the story is Harmony then Hermione will be a Ravenclaw and solve it. It's not that big of an issue but I was pointing out a variety of things I found stupid.

"even if he really didn't know her and isn't in the same house" I was implying that he basically doesn't have any sort of relationship with her yet knows shes been crying in the bathroom all day. I recall this happens a lot actually, like Harry isn't her friend/acquaintance but is at the feast and asks someone "So where's Hermione?" Chances are he forgot even if he saw and just happily ate while a troll killed her.

***** This. Remembering a goblin's name is hardly that spectacular, and iirc one of the reasons Griphook agreed to work with Harry&co was because of how Harry treated Dobby (particularly with regards to the house-elf's death).

** - Manipulative megalomaniac Dumbledore
- Suddenly Succulent&Sexy Severus Snape (where the author conveniently forgets that Snape was the living embodiment of every horrible teacher cranked up to eleven, and instead turn him into a sex god just because.)
- "Creature inheritance" is making me deeply allergic.
- Harry is descended from everyone and their imaginary goldfish. For some reason the author thinks it's a good idea to have him include EVERY SINGLE SURNAME in his new name. Which adds up to maybe twenty, at least.

*** I once saw a fic where Harry referred to himself as Harry Evans-Potter-Black and all I could think of was "why?"

It's also kind of annoying to identify a woman's maiden name every time you bring them up. "Lily Potter née Evans."
