Harry is reincarnated as a female Hobbit called Willowyn. She is not really Harry just has done memories of being him and a few character traits. They don't even speak about being Harry, she just comments about it a few times in her head. Willow is actually her own person.

She is overprotective over Bilbo and takes his place in the Quest of Thorin. She is able to fight, has a strong and likeable attitude is not cringe. It is not about love until the end really. The characters are readable and not OoC. I really love it and already read it about the 8th time.
