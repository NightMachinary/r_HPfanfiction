Grammatically speaking, and from a pure storytelling perspective, canon isn't bad. Rowling can tell a story.

The thing is, reading the series as an adult, it becomes harder and harder to like it. And I understand that it wasn't intended for adults, the first books were meant as children's stories, which is why I'm honestly amazed it even got as much traction with adults as it did.

For example, the magic. In canon, it's so dull, so boring. Maybe it's because we've already read the books and dozens, hundreds of fanfics, but I remember thinking even as a child how utterly dull Rowling made magic. She didn't explain it, she didn't make it interesting, it was all crap like pronouncing a made up word the right way, or doing some arbitrary flick or swish.

Ideally, you want the reader to grow and learn with the main cast of characters, but I just don't see that in canon. Hogwarts is a fancy backdrop, but nobody actually learns anything there.

We don't even know what magic is, where it comes from, anything. A little mystery is fine, but this question is never even /posed/ in the books!

A perfect example is the dueling in canon. As one guy put it, it's just ping pong with the same tired spells.

"Voldemort's equal"?

Yeah, I guess he is, when the only 3 spells Voldemort seems to know is Crucio, Abra Kadabra, and Imperio, and the only 3 spells Harry knows is Expelliramus, protego, and stupefy.

Reading it again, I'm struck by the bland combat, the dull magic, the mostly static characters, and the ridiculous nature of the school itself and the government as Rowling portrays it.

I mean, am I unique in that the more fanfiction I read, and the older I get, the less I like canon? Is anyone else in the same position, or is it just me?

I can't even say I'm a Harry Potter fan, because I'm not - I'm a Harry Potter fanfiction fan. And it's fucking weird to be a fan of a /fan adaptation/ of something you /don't even like/.


** There's something about the Harry Potter books that I've found that a lot of people don't recognize, and that's that Rowling's stories aren't about magic; they're about people.

Harry Potter was popular because it was really, really fun to spend time with Hagrid, with Fred and George, with Stan Shunpike. Ron would make me crack up when he mentions to Harry while they're walking through the castle in their Third Year that Hermione is off studying somewhere, "for once." I teared up when Harry thinks to himself as Mrs Weasley puts her arms around him that he has no memory of ever being hugged like this, as though by a mother. And I felt just as horrified and angry and confused and betrayed as Harry does when Snape killed Dumbledore.

Of course magic plays a huge role in the story, obviously. It sets the tone and creates a really fun environment for these stories. But Rowling doesn't bog us down in rules and semantics and combat strategies because that's not the kind of story she was interested in /at all,/ and it's not the story she set out to create. She was interested telling stories about people.

Is it really fun and creative when people write fanfiction that does flesh out the rules and semantics and combat strategies? Of course! I love reading that kind of stuff. But I'll always still love reading the Harry Potter books too, because I just love spending time in that world, with those people.

*** Even the people are static. Ideally, if it was a story about people or coming of age, you would see real character growth and character change in response to these events and interacting I don't feel that anyone in the story is fundamentally different - or has really changed in any significant way - from how they were introduced.

I remember when I brought this lack of character development up, a bunch of people talked about how Hermione is less of a teacher's pet throughout the books. Like, ok? That seems a really weak point and a really shallow change even if true, especially since even up to the later books she kept reprimandjng them that it's "Professor Snape" or that he's a teacher.

** Well I don't find it boring. I actually love the whimsical nature of magic in Harry Potter-there's a lot randomness to it at times, a lot of it is just there for fun and it works.

It's really not meant to be taken too seriously and there's a sort of point where adding too much detail to magic makes it (for me) extraordinarily boring. Combat is extraneous to my enjoyment, but there's definitely a lot of variation when other characters are casting spells. Harry does not know that many spells and Voldemort rarely has to use many beyond the few he does use.

The wizarding government is (well mostly) satirical take on real life governments.

*** Maybe I didn't phrase myself correctly.

My problem with the magic isn't that it isn't explained, but that it's never even explored to any capacity. It's treated almost mundane. Kind of like how we flip a switch and expect a bulb to turn on, that's essentially how magic in Harry Potter works. It's procedural and boring, whilst simultaneously not being explored or explained in any way.

I don't see HP canon magic as being whimsical or mysterious, it's white the opposite, to be honest.

**** It is explored, through every book there's always new spells, new items that do something exciting and strange.

The latter books are more about the plot than fleshing out the world further (because there's enough of a foundation)-but even then there's always strange bits of magic and commentary on the wizarding world.

** There are a LOT of holes in canon (plot holes or logical fallacies) If you were an analytical child, you noticed many of them right away. (Lol does the sorting hat subconsciously even out the crowd so there's no disparity? What does the disarming spell even do bc apparently it does a lot of things. Why hasn't Hogwarts been shut down yet)

BUT, as someone pointed out above, canon is really about people and I'll add their environment. I mean think about some of the signature characters: (and you pick any of them)

Dumbledore: A wizard so great he died to his own machinations. (The most impactful death I think)

Umbridge: Intense dislike by everyone.

Sirius Black: I've read a lot of creative work; seen a lot of good TV; seen the best on the big screen; read amazing novels. Sirius Blacks death is still in my top 5 deaths of all time (regardless of the creative medium)

Dobby: Even Dobby is charming in his self less service.

I just pulled this characters out of thin air. Rowling might not of created the most enigmatic, complex, original, most dimensional characters but she did flush them out like a damn good storyteller.

The series is really about the variables of peoplehood and the values of people.

I think it says a lot about just how bright this children's series burned that we put adult contexts to it.

And some of the greatest moments in canon, were people-moments. Taking out Umbridge.

(But yah, lol, I totally get what your saying.)

** It's true that the reader has to actually put some effort into understanding the HP magic system rather than having it spoon-fed to them. However, because we /see/ quite a lot of magic, there's a fair amount that we can figure out.

I've written over 30,000 words exploring the canon magic system, and I'm probably only half way through. So no, I don't think it's simple, dull, or unexplored.

***** I mean, yeah, it's a little interesting because of what we don't know about it, but at the same time, it's incredibly dull because of what we *do* know about it.

Namely, pronounce some vaguely Latin-sounding word, do a swish and flick, and a light flies out of your wand.

If that's not boring, I don't know what is.

**** That's what makes it so fun. There's little hints of stuff here and there and trying to figure out how it might fit together is incredibly rewarding.

I used to love hard magic systems with all the rules explained and thoroughly mapped out, but as I've grown older they feel too artificial and restrictive. It's impossible for one person to map out every little detail of how a magic system that's been developed by millions of people for thousands of years would work. Rowling method is great because the magic looks basic on the surface, but as you note down all the little hints she has given, you start realizing that it's a system with infinite depth.

So yeah, other magic systems might be more consistent and immediately understandeable, but Rowling's is far more fun to explore.

** I'm probably one of the oldest here, and I like Harry Potter, especially because I like most of the canon characters. What I don't like is 90% of what's offered as Harry Potter fanfiction. More often than not there's nothing left except OCs labelled with the names of canon characters, randomly blended in strange plotlines. I find it boring that a story must be as abstruse as possible to get readers.\\
If you don't like Harry Potter anymore...just read something else.

** You're going to get (keep) downvoted, and I think that's a real shame. I don't agree with you, but this post has prompted some really good discussion.

I agree with the other posters that Harry Potter is more about the characters than the magic. Rowling pretty much just uses magic willy nilly to propel the plot. Or if not, it's just used as a metaphor for something else. I'm totally ok with that - imo the emotional pay off is worth it. But I get how it'd bother others.

I get bored reading action scenes anyway, so I actually really like how JKR doesn't focus on the action aspect very much.

Another point I will make - it's easy to forget that HP is really influential - Rowling pretty much invented the YA fantasy genre. HP can seem bland in retrospect, because so much that came afterwards is similar to it, and builds on it.

*** I didn't expect anything other than downvotes, to be honest. I know this crowd.

Everyone keeps saying that it's a character story, not a magic story. But I don't even see that. All the characters are pretty static from day 1 of them being introduced, and the greatest character growth that comes is in the form of flashbacks and memories, almost like Rowling woke up one day and said, "shit, these characters aren't very good and are pretty one dimensional, let's add quickly tack on some ad-hoc events which rationalize their current character".

I just don't see the characters as interesting either. The only interesting character is Dumbledore, and isn't that just a perfect example of what I mean, considering almost everything we know of him comes from tacked on penseive memories and events in the final book?

**** The story is centred on the Golden trio - and you can't make the argument that they don't change and grow.

In a kids series, I think it's pretty much expected that the adult side characters aren't going to grow much. But even then, I don't think it's fair to say that they're static, because we see them change a lot in how they treat Harry as he ages, and how they react to the war.

Eg at the end of book four Dumbledore takes a sharp turn away from his happy go lucky “twinkly” characterisation, and suddenly becomes a badass. Then the Dumbledore from book 5 is very different from Dumbledore in book 6.

Personally I used to enjoy it until I hit the fanfiction where it poke so many plot hole in the canon. Hell, I even support Draco and Hermione as couple as it truly show the war between pure and mud had come to an end. But alas, you can't have anything.

It was about removing the idea of pureblood supremacy. And that's something we never see Draco change his mind on, and from his behavior in Deathly Hallows, I don't think he would have. Did he stay and fight with Hogwarts against Voldemort and the ideals he supported? No, he ran from the battle, and showed that he was (still) a coward.
