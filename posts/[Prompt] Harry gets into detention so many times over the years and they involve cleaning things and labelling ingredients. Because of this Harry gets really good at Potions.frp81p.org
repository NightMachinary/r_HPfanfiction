The second task's clue says that one has to stay underwater for 1 hour. Harry thinks of Gillyweed himself.

Or something like that


** Also knows his way around Hogwarts damn well and can label any magical thing you put in front of him.

Sorry but just because you know the ingredients doesn't mean you are a good potioneer, you need to know how to prepare those ingredients and then you need to have good timing and finesse Example: /try making some complicated dish with just the ingredients/

That labeling could help harry otherwise too, just need to be a bit creative about the situations he gets into.

*** That's true. Just knowing the ingredients will not help him become better at potions.

That's why I mentioned the second task. Like if he's labelled the ingredients, maybe he's just curious enough to find out what they do and it goes from there.

But what you mentioned at the end is also right. Use his knowledge of these things in interesting situations

** If you haven't already read The Problem of Potions I'm sure you'd enjoy it- not the same prompt of course but an interesting premise
