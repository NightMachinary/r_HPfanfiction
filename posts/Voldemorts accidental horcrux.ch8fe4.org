So i got this idea if the accidental horcrux lays dormant in Harry's head for so long it gains some of Harry's personality traits, so maybe the horcrux 'Voldemort' can feel love (not much, but still) etc etc.


** The best example I can come up with for this is a lesser known fic, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Unlocked Knowledge). Basically, the Horcrux overtime changed its views through watching Harry's struggles and interactions.

  When Harry returns home to Privet Drive after the fiasco at the Department of Mysteries, he finds that Voldemort's possession released the Horcrux inside of him. In addition to the companionship of "Tom", Harry has his knowledge, and must learn to use it

** I've read a few fics with similar premises, though they are all (non-slash) Harry/Voldemort fics

!linkffn(When Harry met Tom)

Harry talks with the Horcrux in the most recent chapter. He's just tired and resigned.

!linkffn(Devil take the Hindmost)

In this one, Voldemort is constantly aware of fem!Harry due to the Horcrux connection. Being stuck with the Dursleys, she quickly considers "Tom" to be her only friend, and is very fond of him. Voldemort describes feeling her love for him through the connection as "carving out the pathways in his mind", allowing him to actually feel and understand love.

** Different Harry, but you've never read The Dresden Files, something similar happens. Harry Dresden gets the imprint of a fallen angel stuck in his head. The imprint's purpose is to corrupt Harry and tempt him with power so he'll willingly become the vessel for the ACTUAL fallen angel, who is currently imprisoned in an old silver coin (there are thirty of them). Harry resist and over time (several books) subtly changes the imprinted angel. This whole process is explored through books 5-8.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
