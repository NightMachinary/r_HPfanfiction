Not pairing him with anyone at all would be even better. I'd love to see him become a better person because he found it in himself.


** linkffn(Exile by bennybear) is really the only one I can think of. It is a canon divergent fic starting when Voldemort is beaten, and it is all about Draco trying to figure shit out.

  It is a canon divergent fic...
#+end_quote

Is it? It's been a while since I read it, but I'm not sure there's anything in it which conflicts with the canon story or even the epilogue. Unless you're talking about something from Cursed Child which which I'm not familiar.

**** We know from Canon that Draco marries Astoria Greengrass. In bennybear's stories, he ends up marrying a muggle. Not a large divergence, but a real one.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

** "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child": Draco in that fic is actually credible and likable.

Draco's 'redemption' in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855), is hilarious and a highlight of that fic.

  On the train platform, Harry suffered a hug from Remus, a hair ruffle from Sirius, and a "don't do anything I wouldn't do" from his mother, and then he ran for the brick wall, cart rattling before him. The snowy owl they'd gotten him hooted softly in protest. Harry had named her Ororo after the Muggle comic books his mother had introduced him to. Lily took Harry to the comic store every time he sat through a whole visit with his aunt, uncle, and cousin and didn't kick anybody unless they kicked him first. Bill tried to wipe some dirt off a dodging Ron's nose. Ginny complained loudly about being left behind. Fred and George ran off to see Lee Jordan's spider. People watched the Weasleys from all directions--they were hard to miss--and Ron's shoulders slowly rose up and up to his reddening ears. He missed the big empty orchards behind the Burrow already. Ron was one of the last people on the train. He slid past staring eyes and finally stepped himself into an almost unoccupied compartment-- there was just one small boy tucked in there. He had messy dark hair, slightly askew round glasses, and a comic book held up in front of his nose. "Is it okay if I sit here?" said Ron. "Everywhere else is full."
