My favourite trope is TimeTravel!Harry and over the years I've read hundreds of them. Over time I've noticed that when romance is involved they seem to fall into two categories.

1. If Harry is dating another teenager then Harry is a physical and hormonal teen who just happens to have memories of his previous future life.
2. If Harry is dating an adult then he is his future self who just happens to be in a teenage body.

For me personally I've always found it a bit of a moral gray area when TT!Harry has a relationship. Depending on the skill of the author my opinion can seesaw back and forth on whether TT!Harry should even be dating at all.

What are your thoughts on this?


** I feel that it can depend a /lot/ on the specifics of the story. For example, if Harry travels back in time around a year, and dates someone his (physical) age. Seems pretty normal to me.

Of course, it could be adult!Harry who travels back to a teenager body, and dates a teenager, which I find /weird/, but also depends on the author writing it.

In more general terms, I feel that it also depends on what was happening /when/ Harry traveled from. For example, if it's an apocalypse or something, he shouldn't necessarily be focused on romance, rather on saving the world. Or, if he travels back from a “Good ending,” I'd have him try to focus on /returning/ to his original world.

** yup noticed this too and I don't personally like it at all since it cuz seems very convenient for the story. That's why I prefer him to not actually have any relationships at all. I anyways feel like he always felt out of place and not comfortable with the people around him as they aren't the same people he left behind in the future. (In cases where he has a good ending and has friends and family there)

Of course it does depend on how the author writes it.

*** I think that the right approach would be for Harry to have issues connecting with his original friends if he went back more than a couple of years. Depending on how far he went back, Tonks could be his contemporary, or Moody.

And it's honestly better to avoid serious relationships before the 4th year anyway, and maybe a few more if there's a large age difference in body.

** I honestly believe it's questions like this and the mental strain of leaving everything you know behind (and having no one who knows you) that causes the real stress of time travel, on top of the mental stress of keeping everything together in your head.

I have a few different time travel stories and have attacked them in different ways. Because we have magic there are ways to try and get around the adult dating children---or even rooming with children---dilemma.

The whole de-aging thing can work really well or the memory thing, or they meet people their age which is also fun. But I do think it's this kind of question that can make it such a fun trope to play with

** I find it extremely uncomfortable if any TT dates a previous partner. It often comes across as trying to groom them into who they used to be.

I don't mind if a TT finds themselves dating someone completely different, especially if that relationship is based on the TT appreciating the maturity and level-headedness of their new partner.

** I don't like TT Harry dating hogwarts students. Yeah, it's morally gray but mentally... Ugh how could you even deal with it?

I'm 28 and the idea of dating even at 18 year old boy is gross. They are so young.

Not enough fics deal with an adult being stuck in a child's body with everyone around them being younger than they are. I couldn't imagine being 11 again and attending middle school and being surrounded by edgy teenagers.

** When I write a story where someone's physical and mental ages are mismatched I don't do romance. Maybe have the character become a workaholic with no time for romance. After all, when someone's time traveling they usually have something to do in the past. That can become pretty interesting when the character becomes so obsessed with a task that it becomes a serious character flaw.

** I think it all really depends on the time travel senario. I mean, I've read about 6 marvellous ones which I think balances these themes rather well (as well as being rare pairs. I'll link them below)

Btw, don't worry, only the last one is abandoned.

[Skip back to Chapter 1, I'm too lazy.] - Regulus x Harry Fanfic; very nice little Fanfic, and while it's only 10 chapters, it's about over 90,000 words overall. Complete.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23486791/chapters/56315872#workskin]]

- Albus x Harry Fanfic; quite a beautiful fanfic really, and it's extremely interesting from the first human interaction. It really tears as your heart strings, and want to make you read several lines over and over, just relishing the story line. Still updating.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12402654/chapters/28221378]]

[Skip back to chapter 1] - Sirius Black x Harry Potter; absolutely phenomenal, and because this was written before Deathly Hallows was released, it's a real treat. Complete.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/979182/chapters/1930288#workskin]]

- Albus x Harry; a beautiful fic that truely explores Albus's teenage years at school. And it also has the absolute best characterization of Albus's stubborn arse of a brother that I've ever met. Still updating.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15439710/chapters/35837847]]

- Tea With no Sympathy- Harry x Draco. A really awesomely written fanfic where Draco goes back in time... again, and again, and again, until he finally makes the right decision. Complete.

Wattpad- Harry Potter and the Time Fluke by sunshinedarian- Tomarry. It's quite a good little fic, and I found myself inwardly cheering at bits and pieces of it. I think there's only one chapter left to update.

Wattpad- Nineteen Forty Four by alchemisery: Tomarry. Still updating, but I quite enjoyed this as well. It is a beautifully written fanfic.

Also search up the fic 'Against my Nature', on Wattpad. It's no longer updating, because the previous author deleted all her stories on AO, and a fellow Wattpader saved it all onto Wattpad. It's the last copy of a pretty decent and imaginative Harry x Newt.

And lastly, there's a really good S.Slytherin x Harry, but just ask me for more details- I can't be bothered to look it up now. Set in the Founders era, complete.

** If it's just a couple of years back (like most of the "Don't Fear the Reaper" stories) then it's generally not too bad, but if it was an older, more adult Harry it gets really squicky.

Beyond that, it also depends somewhat on how a relationship comes about: One fic that I can never remember the name of has a time-traveling Harry actively avoiding everyone only for Hermione to reach out and befriend him, and even then they only end up romantically entangled when she's at university (after her friends discuss the trolley problem, if that reminds anyone of which fic it is). He didn't groom her, and instead of trying to recreate an old relationship or pick back up where he'd left off it was an entirely new relationship with this different version of Hermione. In "Ah, Screw It!", Harry again tries to avoid romantic relationships with people his physical age because he's got almost seven years of memories on them, and again is pursued and has to be persuaded at length to actually respond to romantic advances.

As far as option #1 in the OP, if it's made clear that despite having the memories of an adult Harry still has the neurological and emotional maturity to match his physical age, it drastically diminishes any squick factor, since at that point he's less an adult and more a very knowledgeable teenager. The main characters of "Ghost of Privet Drive" and "Beyond the Outer Gate Lies..." both explicitly fall into this category.

** The biggest issue for me when considering TT! Harry in a relationship is actually the difference in life experience. This actually has less to do with the ick factor and more to do with how believable I find the story. In high school I struggled to connect with a lot of my peers simply because I'd had a lot more life experience (moving a lot, living overseas, being independent etc). Most of the kids I knew someone had never left their town for more than a week and had never done their own laundry, so I just didn't date in high school. That's without any trauma or age gap, just me being slightly more mature than my peers.

So I struggle to see Harry, who has gone through all he has in the books, dating some school kid that has next to no life experience. He's seen friends die and had the weight of the world on his shoulders, I struggle to imagine him really connecting with someone who's biggest worry in life so far has been homework. I'm not saying that he can only connect with someone who has shared trauma, but most teenagers really struggle to look beyond their own lives and still have a lot of growing up to do.

** Depending on the story, I can support TT Harry dating a teenager. It's how the author writes it.

Although I prefer it when Harry and his love interest TT, since it's not so weird.

*** You're forgetting Harry's personal morality otherwise you make a great point. Honestly said there are too few stories where Harry really experiences moral dilemmas, not necessarily even the "I'm dating a teenager" kind, but other interesting situations.

***** Indeed, and exactly those kinds of dilemmas would be great to explore in fanfiction.

Though I would also say that as an 80-or-so-years-old the need for companionship wouldn't be as strong, especially if Harry was in a longterm relationship before the time travel. He'd probably still be mourning the person, and I don't think dating the same person would be honouring the memory.

That would also open a conflict between mature mind and teenage hormones. And with that in play even the most moralistic Harry may come into temptation.

To your first question i don't think there's an universal answer, especially as even a few centuries back there wasn't as much of a stigma about huge age gaps as today. Even in the present there are those kind of couples and while not as accepted in society, no one would try to break them up on moral reasons alone. (Especially persons not affiliated with either of the persons dating)

****** From what I remember the times he's gone from being old he didn't have a ship because he felt he'd lived his life once and was happy to try and do things. Maybe he ddI later but for the sake of the fic it's gen. which is cool
