Basically what it says\\
Harry travels back in time, I think kills Tobias Snape (could be wrong bout that tho) buys all of Severus's Hogwarts supplies and shit. Harry also buys Snape shampoo.

Snape eventually tries to repay Harry with sex or something during his 6th year. Harry rejects him, thankfully. I forgot how it goes from there.

Any help would be appreciated, thanks!


** Sounds like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2060?view_adult=true][Escaping the Paradox]].

** I think I know which one you are talking about and I am sure it is on AO3. If you look for Snarry fics on AO3, select only finished and sort by Kudos and it should be one of the fics on the first 5 pages.

IIRC Harry does not kill Tobias, but deck him one or piss him off. And Snape does the deed with Regulus Black before taking it up with Harry. And unless I am mixing stuff up, I think Harry tried to pass himself as a Potter cousin.
