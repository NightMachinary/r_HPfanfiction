One of the things that strike me about Hermione/whoever time travel stories is how she's easily able to fit into any society that she's thrown into whether it's the Slytherin Purebloods of the 1940s, or the utmost confidence of the Marauders and Lily (and maybe Snape, for some reason)- But she can barely fit into her own social circle in the 1990s. One could argue it's because of her Muggleborn status, but really she is hopelessly awkward and that's never touched upon in these stories. She's always poised, very intuitive to the slightest facial expressions, and inhumanely empathetic.


** "intuitive to the slightest facial expressions"

Honestly, you've just described... All of fanon. It's one of my biggest pet peeves, and so widespread that it's hard to read a story without it. I swear every single authors favorite way of displaying emotion is a twitch of the mouth, which is miraculously interpreted by our hero to mean the exact right thing. I don't think I've ever actually seen someone's mouth twitch in real life because most people just laugh or smile like normal human beings.

Anyway, rant aside, I'm gonna go check out my library and see if it has any stories that fit the bill.

linkffn(One Hundred Sixty nine)

This is the only fic I have featuring a time travelling Hermione-centric romance, though I wouldn't say that it necessarily focuses on her awkwardness.

linkffn(Backward with purpose part I: Always and Always)

This one veeeerrry loosely can be considered relevant, but it and its sequels are so good that I'm going to link it anyway. Hermione herself is not a time Traveller, but she falls in love with one, and, from what I remember, is quite awkward (this is somewhat of a Canon rehash up to like 5th year, so beware).

*** Twitch of the mouth? Try glint in the eyes.

Seriously, how do these fanfic characters distinguish a mean glint from an excited glint? Or from sunlight reflecting in the eyes? And most importantly, /where does the glint come from/? Does every character in every fanfic have magical glinting eyes?

On the topic of light in characters' eyes, I've seen several fanfics in which Dumbledore's perpetually twinkling eyes is either because of a spell he uses to look more special/trustworthy or because it's a sign of his extreme power level (similar to Harry's freakishly green glowing eyes in many OP!Harry fics).

***** Yeah I've read that too and personally I think he just uses a spell like that because he likes when his eyes twinkle because that's something he would do

But I can't imagine everyone in the wizarding world using spells like that, especially when it appears that this glint is the only thing that betrays their emotions.

Actually, I can see it if wizards and witches all were unable to read or express emotions and so they all spell themselves to show their emotions via glints in their eyes for better communication. Perhaps it's even a ritual that does it for the entire population. And the Slytherins all work to destroy the ritual or remove its effect from themselves so they can scheme without their eyes are glinting suspiciously. It's actually the reason why Voldemort hates the Muggleborn, because they don't have the telltale glint.

This actually sounds like something JKR would tweet.

**** Cant say I understand how this works in fiction but in real life sometimes tiny subtle changes are seen in people and often can serve as predictors of behavior. As a nurse I rely on these sudden subtle changes to serve as predictors as to whether or not my patient will remain stable or maybe crash. Example had a coworker who worked at our clinic and I noticed a very subtle change in her behavior something in her eyes or how she processed information that seemed suddenly off. (It was something I had seen before in a patient I had) Nobody else noticed said they saw nothing different in her behavior at all. However; I could not shake the feeling off so I insisted on driving her home. Mid way during the drive home she had a seizure and almost fell out car door I had to pull car over in heavy traffic while holding her with one hand and driving the car with the other hand to keep her from falling out the car door. (Called EMS got her to hospital and gave thanks that notice that subtle glint in her eye that seemed off) Noticing these very small facial expressions or ways people change pace of there speech all are early indicators of certain behaviors that you can predict in some cases. Sometimes even serve to anticipate if someone is targeting you or noticing if someone likes you or dislikes you. Often time this is written on person face. It can even help you predict what someone wants before they ask for it. This is actually a skill that can come in very handy as a parent. The Greater Good Science Center at the University of California at Berkeley has devised [[http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/ei_quiz/][a tricky body language quiz]] to test if you can correctly guess what emotions people are expressing. Mind readers often are people with highly-developed /nonverbal/ decoding /skills./ Guess /poker/ players use that skill to predict if you got good hand or are you bluffing. So maybe there is something to that glint or twitch in your eye or mouth lol

***** That's quite interesting and perhaps relates to the "twitch of the mouth" but a "glint in the eyes" is literally a reflection of light and not a facial expression. It's sometimes used in descriptions, especially in fiction but occasionally in real life too, but it is not an actual thing that exists as an expression.

******* A glint is a reflection of light, and if your cornea is wetter than usual that would lead to a different refractive behaviour. That can happen as a natural response to certain stimuli like bright light, or when crying. So if anything, a glint in the eye might be indicative of crying. But your eyes can glint while they are "dry" too if the light falls on them in the right angle, so it's pretty much random.

** Ugh, I've seen fics where Hermione acts like an insufferable know-it-all, extra-pedantic and smug about her own intelligence... and then all the boys fall for her anyway. When she asks her boytoy why such a sexy Slytherin Sex God would fall for a Bushy-Haired Bookworm like her, they laugh and tell her she's beautiful and lovely just the way she is, bookworminess or not.

Then I realized that these fics don't care about realism, just feelgood fantasy. And Hermione's unconventional looks or pedanticness aren't used as character flaws, and have no effect on the story's plot or how the other characters interact with her. They're merely a way to give her some traits that are "relatable" so Hermione feels like she's "one of us".

Canon can be massaged the same way to get that result, just as you can for Badass!Hermione. Her Yule Ball appearance caught Draco's attention.

#+begin_quote
  But she didn't look like Hermione at all. She had done something with her hair; it was no longer bushy, but sleek and shiny, and twisted up into an elegant knot at the back of her head. She was wearing robes made of a floaty, periwinkle-blue material, and she was holding herself differently, somehow---or maybe it was merely the absence of the twenty or so books she usually had slung over her back.

  Parvati was gazing at Hermione in unflattering disbelief. She wasn't the only one, either; when the doors to the Great Hall opened, Krum's fan club from the library stalked past, throwing Hermione looks of deepest loathing. Pansy Parkinson gaped at her as she walked by with Malfoy, and even he didn't seem to be able to find an insult to throw at her.

***** To add onto this: If those character traits /don't/ count as flaws... then that version of Hermione has no flaws at all.

And if that's the case, what does that do to her character?

If Hermione's flaws, her traits of bossiness and self-righteousness, are portrayed in the story and treated by other characters as her being "motivated" and the "moral center", she basically becomes Emma Watson Movie Hermione. A bland, blank-slate character who remains static throughout the whole of the story. She's always strong, good, and competent, at the expense of having growth (and being the narrative equivalent of plain oatmeal), compared to Ron's arc of jealousy, doubt, and frustration, leading to his abandonment of the team, and his return to earn forgiveness when he realizes what he's done.

This kind of reminds me of an interview by Daisy Ridley, an actress in Star Wars, [[https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2018/03/10/star-wars-star-daisy-ridley-says-that-rey-has-no-weaknesses/#536a04f04418][who shares the same perspective of "flaws are subjective".]]

** This is the main reason why I have to filter out Hermione or Sakura as main characters from searches. There's nothing wrong with the characters themselves (okay, that was a lie, Sakura is mediocre), but the way they're often portrayed is so Mary Sue-ish the authors ought to be punished. It's infuriating to come across fic after fic where the prose and most things are really good, only to have it ruined by Mary Sue. They keep pulling out new magics or jutsus out of their ass and are super geniuses at everything. And you can tell it's a thinly veiled self insert too, the way they keep cooing about Ron and Harry as "her boys" or Naruto and Sasuke as "her pack". Disgusting.

*** That's surprising to hear on Sakura - really, Naruto fics are far more filled with main character OPness when it isn't Sakura in my rather limited experience. Plus, she seems to have a lot of potential to a) make into a better character than whatever mess Naruto canon is, and b) actually not be crazy overpowered so needing to be smart.

I'm sure there's some wish fulfilment fics, but they don't seem to nearly compare in Volume to the Naruto wish fulfilment ones, or Harry in this fandom

**** If you look on FFN, it's definitely more OP Naruto, but I've found AO3 to be infuriatingly Sakura galore. If you cut out all the Sasuke/Naruto slash there's a lot of Sakura around. Basically anything that's tagged as BAMF Sakura is suspect, same with BAMF Hermione. OP Sakura is way less believable because in a story where the final battles are like gods duking it out, she's far lesser. Her Chakra pool is tiny, her motivation weak, and her foundation inferior. Yet these stories like to make it so that the moment she puts in effort she's baby Itachi and better. She's intelligent, but she's not next Itachi or next Hokage levels of intelligent. The thing is, she's intelligent enough to definitely be a major player, but not in the way that fanfic authors like to make her out to be. She couldn't be frontline, but what canon has her do is fairly close to optimal. The top fic on AO3 for Sakura is Pulling My Weight or something, and it's been a while since I read it, but at one point, Sasuke tries to fight her and Orochimaru stops him and says she could destroy his mind with one finger. That's canonically out of her skillset and Naruto isn't a world where with enough intelligence you could reasonably segue into any skillset. My biggest problem with Sakura or Hermione fics is that since they're not the main characters, when people write them, they want to make them important. Put a piece of themselves into them, spruce them up a bit. So while there's mountains more Harry or Naruto wish-fulfillment trash out there, Sakura and Hermione fics just tend towards being wish fulfillment, so when you want to read a good fic about them it's hard.

I'd question exactly what standard of intelligence Itachi actually is given than he killed his entire clan at the behest of Danzo. He mindraped his brother twice and expected him to just live a normal life afterward and rebuild their clan. He allegedly became a spy in Akatsuki and yet Konoha and Naruto are continually surprised by Akatsuki's actions and motivations throughout Shipuuden. These are not the actions of an intelligent character.

****** I had a much longer comment that accidentally got deleted, so all I'll say is that everyone was holding the idiot ball throughout the series, so just as we consider Dumbledore to be probably smarter than Hermione in spite of glaring plotholes, so do we consider Itachi to be smarter than Sakura. Also, I'd like to say that the killing of the clan was fairly close to the optimal choice if you analyse the circumstances. I think he should have spared the children, but maybe he wanted Sasuke to be more focused on getting revenge than waste his time taking care of the children. Getting Sasuke to kill him in order to activate the Mangekyō and then get the eternal Mangekyō is a pretty good idea, though no need to mindrape Sasuke, that's pretty dumb. Not quite sure Kishimoto came up with all this when he decided to have Itachi do all of that, but the Watsonian explanation at least partially checks out. He became a spy, but I think his only point of contact was Danzō, who was a dick and definitely would not tell Tsunade. I don't think he kept in contact with the Third, but even if he did he probably wouldn't keep in contact with Tsunade because she'd probably ruin his whole suicide plan or something.

******* There's definitely different types and areas of intelligence. She's intelligent enough to learn and apply doctor level medical science as a teenager. Naruto, although he eventually became Hokage, definitely could never do that. "Kage level intellect" IMHO refers more to politics, strategy and wisdom than science and medicine. Even if she wasn't portrayed so pathetically in canon, I don't see Sakura leading an army. But then I don't see Naruto performing eye surgery.

I totally get you about the the idiot ball being handed to everyone to make the plot more forward, but I'd say that unlike with Dumbledore, we never see Itachi being brilliant at anything except jutsus. Dumbledore is shown to be a powerful wizard and a subtle manipulator. That the plot requires him to hold the idiot ball in the first few books notwithstanding, we have canon evidence of his brilliance. Itachi... Not so much. Definitely one of the most powerful and brilliant shinobi, but strategic brilliance? Political cunning? Wisdom? No. His character arc shows the total opposite of that. He gets played by Danzo, enacts a cunning plan on his brother that while displaying amazing feats of genjutsu breaks him completely, and ultimately fails because Sasuke rejects everything Itachi planned for him.

IMHO the Uchiha massacre doesn't make sense. That nothing could be done until matters reached a boiling point and the options were either personality warping dojutsu or genocide was just stupid. It reflects very badly on both Hiruzen's competence and character. Danzo himself is just a convenient plot device to take all the blame that would otherwise be heaped on Hiruzen. Can't put Naruto's loving grandfather figure in a bad light. At the very least children Sasuke's age and younger should have been spared, if not all the civilians. Fugaku could have simply taken his moderate faction and begged mercy from the Hokage. IMHO the blame falls entirely on Hiruzen and his incompetence/weakness. At the end of the day, the massacre still massively weakened the village, and left them more vulnerable to Obito/Madara/Tobi's machinations.

Also, Jiraiya was the spymaster of Konoha, IIRC. At least, that's the Watsonian reason for him not raising Naruto. If the spymaster who was investigating Akatsuki wasn't given the contact for Konoha's spy inside Akatsuki, then Hiruzen is complete trash. Hundreds of people died for nothing.

******* The fault lies with Kishimoto and the shounen genre in general. Women can't be more powerful than men, can't be more competent than men, and have to drop everything and become housewives the moment a child is born. It says something that the most powerful female character in Naruto (Shipuuden-era) is a post menopausal spinster who never had children.

Kishi basically didn't care about Sakura's character arc, and largely used her as a plot device to introduce more tension into the narrative whenever it was needed. Generally by making Sakura make extremely bad decisions that painted her as weak, manipulative and useless. All her vaunted intelligence and skills meant nothing in the face of what her character actually did throughout the story. Which was cry a lot, enter fights she couldn't win, and get rescued by one of the boys.

The largely female writer population of the AO3 Naruto fandom write Sakura as either the most badass of the trio, or the emotional centre of the trio, as a reaction to the very real deficiencies in canon. I tolerate BAMF Sakura better than BAMF Hermione because Sakura was never coddled by the canon narrative. She was the Ron of her trio.

His first action as the new Minister for Magic is to break at least a dozen international laws to bring her home.
