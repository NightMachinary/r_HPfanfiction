So I read the linkffn(Midnight Blues) and can't help but think there should be LOADS more fics with Harry on Her Majesty's Service, firewhiskey and martini, shaken, not stirred - I'm sure there are! Bad-ass Harry, Potter-girls, high speed chases on brooms and flying cars - isn't this what makes this fandom so great?

  After the fall of Voldemort, Harry makes a dumb career choice and Ron tags along. Hermione, sensibly, doesn't. Seven years later, a very different trio are drawn into an international web of intrigue by a little girl and an old relic. Lesson to be learned: stay in school, kids. Post-DH; Slightly AU. Rated M for language and violence. Not slash.

** Kingsman is a recent favorite fandom of mine, which is why I am excited for [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4715726][The White Hart]] linkao3(4715726), linkffn(11484247) in which Harry Potter is meant to become Harry Hart. It isn't too far in the story line yet though... and it is slash, for those who refuse to read slash.

  Harry Hart has always been the most dangerous man alive and one of the most posh, at least in the minds of anyone who has ever met him. Harry Potter on the other hand was always the White Knight, though shorter and more adorable than expected, to the minds of everyone who had ever laid eyes on him. Two such different men, or are they?

*** Funnily enough, I'm in the extremely slow process of writing The Mage of Kingsman. I keep dipping in and out of the Kingsman spirit.

I wish there was more HPxKingsman fics out there.

** linkffn(4019608) "Agent Double O Hex" is comedy take on that. Harry is James Bond's nephew.

And of course [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=30822]["Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived"]], an AU without Magic where Harworts is a school for spies, James Bond is real (it was James Potter's code name), and the fight against Tom Riddle is just a bit bloodier.

  A "tragic" accident leaves young Harry in the care of a relative that nobody knew existed. It seems Lily Evans had an Uncle named Edmund Bond who had a son he called James.
