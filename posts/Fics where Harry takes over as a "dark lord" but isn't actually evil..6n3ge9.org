  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.

***** You know, I recently re-read that, and you can't really say that. You can argue that the particular people responsible deserved it, maybe, but hardly the billions of muggles who weren't involved. You can't even make an argument that the muggles were responsible because they tacitly approved, thus being vicariously responsible or responsible through inaction, they deserved it. One cannot approve of something of which one knows utterly nothing. And the general population, most of those killed, knew nothing of magic until immediately before they died.
