Is there a connection between your favourite book and your preferred point of divergence or do you prefer the divergence to be outside of your favourite? Do you have any examples of stories which, in your opinion, do things "right" in that regard?


** My favorite book is Goblet of Fire yet I don't enjoy most stories set in that time because they feature a lot of tropes I am not fond of, most notably any kind of power-wank or Hermione "betraying" Harry. And the Yule Ball to jumpstart any romance has been done to death. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind a romance where the Yule Ball occurs, it's a significant station of canon after all, but it shouldn't be the first or second date IMO. At the very least, have an evening stroll across the grounds or an afternoon at Hogsmeade beforehand.

There are quite a few stories which do a lot of things right, but there's almost always something that sours the deal for me, like the absurd coming-out angst and overall pacing in the /Yule Ball Panic/ series or too much bashing in most stories where Ron and Hermione are dumped.

** My favourite divergence is post battle of Hogwarts because I'm bored of Hogwarts and how much it tends to limit stories, also fuck the epilogue. With Voldemort gone and characters free to grow and become adults in the wider world it allows for lots more originality and scope. I understand however that originality is hard so I understand why there aren't that many.

If I had to stick to school years, I guess it depends. I like diverging early for maximum differences. Say first year, Harry tries to be polite and charming, keep his head down and work. By keeping to himself and being a bit hollow Dumbledore sees the similarities between Harry and a young Tom Riddle so steps in and we see Harry and Dumbledore having a close relationship. That being said, I don't know if I could read another set of poorly written eleven year olds so I'd prefer the story to take place later, sixth or seventh year. You can do more with teenagers on the cusp of becoming adults.

*** Favourites of post-Hogwarts stories? I don't mind stories that forsake the epilogue and quite enjoy any story set outside Hogwarts (big part of why Deathly Hallows is my favourite book-they spend a lot of time not at Hogwarts).

**** Arguably my favourite story is linkffn(11697407) (contractual invalidation)

Right up there is also linkffn(2859327) (song of the Trees.)

linkffn(10728064) is pretty nice, nothing special but a decent time waster. (days to come)

linkffn(6331126) this author has a bunch of stuff that's post Hogwarts and is compliant with the epilogue. (Northumbrian stuff.)

linkffn(11815544) is something I feel I recommend at least once a week. (flo's aurors)

Linkffn(8262940) is often thought of one of the best, if not the best written HP fanfic there is. That being said I wouldn't say I particularly enjoy it. (Unatoned)

Since its post Hogwarts I'm going to slip in a couple of cross-overs but they're super well known so I reckon you'll probably have read them. linkffn(8177168) is basically the only good Avengers Cross over.

linkffn(8501689) is a fun ride. (Havoc)

linkffn(10016768) is one of the fics I wish there was more of but is sadly abandoned.

There's more out there and the ones I've linked are pretty well know. That should be enough for now.

Generally, I'm most interested in divergence pre-series, whether in the last war or thousands of years ago. As for mid-series, I'm partial to books that diverge after GoF written during the three year summer, or alternative book sixes, though I'm not sure continuing an ongoing series counts as divergence.

**** Oh, I meant that I wouldn't want an author to specifically choose that moment to diverge, by e.g. catching Pettigrew or clearing Sirius' name or, I dunno, having Lupin bite someone.

But if it's an AU, all bets are off. I'd probably be annoyed at an author who sought to repeat the scene exactly despite having a vastly different story.

I do enjoy scenes that evoke this moment, such as the latest chapter of linkffn(Shadow of Angmar) and Fulminare in linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School).

** My favorite book is GoF ("favorite part" is the whole thing, I don't have an exact moment!), but I've never found a good GoF-divergent fic that I like. For me, the earlier the divergence point is usually the better, as long as at least 2/3 of the Trio are still alive and under the canon name and gender.

** My favourite book is Deathly Hallows and I do rather enjoy stories that have Voldemort winning.

For atmosphere I really like [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4377774/1/Midnight][Midnight]] even though I normally can't stand Draco/Hermione. One of the things it gets right to me, is the world, the author writes very differently to JK Rowling but the world is so interesting and I would say it's a believable Voldemort won world.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6884267/1/Stop-All-The-Clocks][Stop All the Clocks]]/[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6989327/1/Children-s-Crusade][Children's Crusade]] : I enjoy reading stories where Ron or Hermione are the ones to lead the revolution after Voldemort's death. I really like the betrayals and the magic used in this story, I also think it depicts a believable world and Voldemort post-win.

Do you prefer him to be the protagonist or the antagonist? Are you talking about winning the Battle of Hogwarts or achiving total victory (Harry and the Order are dead, there is no one left opposing him)?

***** What is the plot of those stories? The magical Nazis won, there's no resistance left and it's impossible to make a stand since the most capable of the generation were wiped out.

I mean, I'd love to read about a magical coalition invading Britain in some kind of reverse D-Day/Operation Sea Lion v2, but I doubt that this is the kind of plot you are going for.

****** Brutal Guerrilla Warfare, there's a resistance but it's Harry's year. Hermione and Ron in these stories are normally potrayed as very capable, learning after years of war. In the case of most of the stories I have read they do enlist the help of a disaffected Death Eater.

For the second one you might like Stop All the Clocks/Children's Crusade. There's a bit where they talk about doing a reverse D-Day and they sought of do it.

** My favorite book is PoA because it's the only one where Voldemort doesn't pop up at the end and say, "Hello, children! Time for death!"

That said, I think the point of divergence for me is the graveyard scene in GoF, simply because it doesn't make sense. Harry's blood is poisonous to Voldemort but helps resurrect him? Okay. Sure. (Seriously, Crouch was in a position to get Dumbledore's blood, why not use it instead of a boy whose not that powerful, and only escapes because of Voldemort's horrible habit of monologuing?)

Moving that aside, I'd say right before Sirius dies, because Sirius is my man, Harry goes bonkers once Sirius is gone, and HBP is just a mess. Once it was seen that Sirius was /fighting/ Voldemort, instead of /supporting/ him, he could be exonerated. And how everything changes from there... well, that's up to you.

** My favorite book is Half Blood Prince, but my favorite point of diversion has always been post-book 4 or 5. To me, the interest is all in how the war plays out - how long, how graphic, the types of attacks or strategies taken by both sides, etc.

I've been reading fic for a long time, and I did the majority of my fic reading back in the days where we were waiting for books 6 and 7 to be released. These were the fics that had the most creativity in how the war plays out because they were written before we knew about the horcruxes. I wish more modern fics would diverge from the horcrux-hunting paradigm and go back to novel ways of defeating Voldemort.

*** I could offer you a story which begins at Slughorn's Christmas party and then abandons any canon plot in favour of an original one. Voldemort is not the only player/antagonist and yet there is some competent support on Harry's side as well as there are 4 parties battling it out (and the Order, but with Dumbledore dying it is rather ineffective).

The things you are complaining about were the reason why I started that endeavour.

  When Harry invited Tonks to Slughorn's Christmas Party, he never expected to stumble into a relationship with his friend. Nor did he expect to be engulfed by a web of deceit and intrigues woven across Europe.
