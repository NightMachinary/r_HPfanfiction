I am looking for some well written HP fanfics with suspense and unpredictable story; preferably with no romance. Would be nice if the work explored HP universe/society/history. Kudos for dark and mature elements.


** Only one I've read is The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks.

Murder Most Horrid sort of counts because of it has the crime/suspense angle and is AU enough to be unpredictable, but it has romance and smut elements. You could skip those, but the author is good at writing it.

This is the only part that applies to these series(below), I'm burnt out on dark and mature stuff since Worm and few HP stories do it well.

Knowledge of Buffy the Vampire Slayer isn't necessary, as they only feature occasionally, and the plot isn't set in the present day.

** Hey,

I don't know if you know the resource already, but I recommend looking into the [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/forumdisplay.php?f=2][Dark Lord Potter Library]].

All the stories with 5 or 4 stars are more than readable, so you probably will find something there, even if I don't have a story ready that fits your requirements. You can go look there in case no one else finds time to answer your request.
