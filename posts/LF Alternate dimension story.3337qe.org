where harry has a sister and his mom is alive and teaching at Hogwarts but they are poor because james left lily then died I think his sister is an empath but im not 100 percent on that


** I believe the story you're looking for is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3150414/1/Parallels]], by Bobmin356. It's a Harry/Hermione story- and yes, the sister is an empath.
