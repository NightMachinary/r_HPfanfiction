I've read some Drarry where Hermione and Draco work together to to solve some problem or other, e.g., Renaissance (linkffn(4780119)). This combination lends itself well to intellectual banter (sorry Ron), and I really enjoy how authors have portrayed the dynamic between the trio. Pairings ok. Any well-written stories come to mind? Thanks in advance!

  Harry awakens after a long sleep to find things terribly changed. He's not in an alternate universe... it just seems like it.
