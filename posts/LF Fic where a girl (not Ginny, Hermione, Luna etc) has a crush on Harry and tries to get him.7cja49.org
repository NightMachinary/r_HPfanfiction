To clarify, when I say try to get Harry, I'm not talking about through a love potion or trying to kidnap him but to get the courage to come up to him. The girl has to be an OC or a minor character in canon. Not Ginny, Hermione, Luna, Tonks etc.

It could end with her getting or not getting Harry.

  Romilda Vane realized she'd been going after Harry Potter the wrong way; it wasn't a question of how, it was a question of when.
