Does any good fics exist where Hermione and Snape puts their considerable brainpower to good use and cooperate?\\
I've read a few that pairs them up, which I don't mind, but I think it'd be interesting to read a fic where they cooperate and Snape at some point starts respecting her i.e. they get a civil/friendly relationship, without it being all "oh, they are made for each other." Does this exist?\\
Cheers.

**** well... I love that fic but they DO get together....lol They also get together in Pet Project, but in a lot of ways it's also an excellent example, and much more about Hermione liking Snape than Snape liking Hermione, if that makes sense. And Pet Project has only one smut section, and the author wrote an alternate chapter without it in there so you have to deal with less SSHG if it's not your cup of tea. (even though I drink that tea 24/7)

Edit: (wineunicorn) to answer your specific question, haven't found any fics that don't still pair them in the end. Sorry!

***** They do get together, but I don't remember it being all "made for each other perfect sappy romance blah" like some turn out to be. I could be misremembering, but I don't remember it being like that.
