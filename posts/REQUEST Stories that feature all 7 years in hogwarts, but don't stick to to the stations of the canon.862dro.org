There are a lot of AU stories, but it seems like most with a completion will either finish early or not finish at all. What are some good stories that have a magical education actually lasting a full 7 years?


** Well that's what I intend to do, but my story's not complete yet by far (though I'm updating /fast/). I'm afraid all good completed seven-year AUs I know are partially Stations-of-Canon-ish, some more than others.

  "Oh, Harry, you're a treasure. That must be right!" smiled Hermione. "But what's the treasure then?"

  "I don't know... something magical, I guess. Maybe something to turn a turban back into a human."

  "Probably."

  A tiny change in the Granger family tree means Hermione is now a Parselmouth when she starts Hogwarts. Changes pile up as foes are defeated, friends are made, secrets are uncovered, and loopholes are delightfully abused.
