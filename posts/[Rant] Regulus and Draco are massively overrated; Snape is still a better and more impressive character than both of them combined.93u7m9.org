regulus- there's nothing to suggest he was pushed into the DEs like draco, even if his parents thought voldemort had the right idea. his parents weren't DEs, even after he was. he was a weirdo who tracked DE activity via newspaper clippings. his only problem was when voldemort fucked with his house elf who he liked; we don't get anything to suggest he disagrees with voldemort's politics or how he treated people. furthermore, not only can you interpret his death as not brave, you can interpret it as straight cowardice. he didn't sacrifice himself, because there was no need for him to die. kreacher could have apparated him out, or use magic to levitate him out. voldemort can read his mind any time and find out he knows where the locket is, so he's toast. if he runs, he'll be killed. if he turns, he'll actually have to oppose his family and stand for something he might not even believe in. nor was his plan clever or thought out. he didn't tell kreacher how to destroy the horcrux, or how to find out how to destroy the horcrux. leaving a note means voldemort could have went back and found out at any time, leading to kreacher and his family being hunted. he essentially chose to kill himself than actually do anything useful, and made things harder for everyone in the long run, as opposed to living and destroying the horcrux himself

draco- i don't think he's ultimately a bad person, but he's...a weenie. he lacks moral fortitude. he's not zuko, because he lacks zuko's will and courage. i don't find not being a racist after being raised by racists impressive in the slightest, especially when it isn't coupled with any actual attempts to do right in any meaningful way that would require strength of character. he doesn't shun his parents. he doesn't oppose voldemort. he halfheartedly doesn't want to participate in direct murder, then continues trying to capture harry, then when there are no more immediate stakes quietly stops being a racist, without any actual apologies or reparations. he still lives off the wealth possessed by his terrorist parents. he's mostly just a weenie. like. what is the big deal?

snape, on the other hand, is near mythic. he's a genius who grew up in a poor and abusive environment, received next to zero love or support his entire life (unlike draco), became a terrorist who eventually delivered the prophecy and catalysed the events of the entire series. his asking voldemort to spare lily is what enabled her to sacrifice herself, which destroyed voldemort. regardless of what you think of snape's affection for lily- it quite literally shaped the world. he then spied and deceived the most powerful dark wizard in centuries, became an assassin to the most powerful wizard in centuries, and again catalysed the events that lead to voldemort's downfall. like, there's a reason there are books written about him in-universe. unlike regulus, he actually did something, and it required actual repeated effort than just dying in a single event. he also rejects the DEs and their ideology and supports the cause, trying to save people when he can, not just a single house elf that he grew up with. years after his death, he's still invoked even by someone he didn't like to talk about his courage. he's not near mythic, he basically is mythic


** Severus is not a good person, he has done many terrible things. He willingly became a Death Eater and willingly served Lord Voldemort. The only reason he stopped doing this is because Voldemort killed the only woman he loved. Did he make the right decision in the end? Yes. But that does not nullify his earlier actions. That's not even touching on the way he treats Harry.

Like Snape, Regulus did willingly join and serve Lord Voldemort as a death eater. But Regulus also gave his life in order to ultimately vanquish him. He may have done evil things, but in the end he made the right choice. I don't know how you can call his death cowardice, nor how you can fault him for the lack of destruction of a Horcrux. He did what he could with the tools he was given.

Draco is the worst of these three. Unlike Severus or Regulus who had some redeeming moment where they did the right thing in the end, Draco never has this. He never once stands up against evil, never once makes the right choice.

None of these three are good people. All three of them willingly served Lord Voldemort. All three of them deserve some form of punishment. However Severus and Regulus in the end (which is what matters) did what was right. If not for their actions Lord Voldemort would not have been defeated.

*** this wasn't really a comment strictly on their morality per se, but their characters overall. i didn't say regulus was a coward, but you can interpret his actions as cowardice as easily as you can him sacrificing himself

that's what i'm doubting

regulus was inconsequential to voldemort's defeat. this is kind of my point. if regulus never stole the locket, not only would it still have been destroyed, it would have been destroyed earlier. more than inconsequential, he was an impediment

** Regulus is not a character we know much about. For me he is interesting because he is young, can still change (i mean where i come from you can get drastically reduced sentences while under 22) and liked Kreacher, essentially a non human slave, enough to not go through with the plan of the homicidal maniac who was probably his idol before. Another point worth mentioning is his brother. Maybe he had an ok relationship with Sirius until he got into Gryffindor. Regulus then felt rejected and got more interested in tradition and death eaters. I like to think he just panicked a bit and did not even think about getting out from the cave

** While I fully agree that Regulus and Draco didn't do much, with Draco doing next to nothing, I think you give Snape too much credit. Sure he had a very rough childhood, but so did Harry, who didn't take part in the murder and discrimination of muggles and muggleborns. The only reason Snape changed his ways is because Voldemort was going to go after Lily, who, if you remember, he insulted and mistreated. He didn't care about the good of what he was doing, he just wanted revenge of Voldemort for killing Lily, and if that had never happened he wouldn't have even switched sides, continuing to help Voldemort in his conquest. He might have been instrumental in the fall of Voldemort, but he is an evil man who never had an altruistic thought in his life.

Great character though, which is proven by this thread.

Snape may have died to save the wizarding world but he didn't help save the wizarding world out of a sense of goodness. The only reason he protects Harry is because he is Lily's son. I agree that Snape is grey, but I think that he is a bad person at his core, not a good one. He does have some redeeming traits and a reason for his badness but that doesn't change who he is.

** theres a lot of blank spots for snape with regard to the kind of shenanigans death eaters get up to that need filling in, and i think Snape's ultimate judgement would depend on those. just what did he actually do in the time period before he decided to abandon Voldemort for Lily's sake?

like, im pretty sure that fanfic makes death eaters out to be a LOT more rapey than they were ever intended to be. but did snape ever murder anyone? did he murder a lot of people? did he ever murder kids?

regulus was disgusted enough by the horcrux that you can buy him being just another scared kid like draco without the stomach to do anything really dirty

*** Even if Snape didn't murder kids, he wasn't against it. He was only against the murder of one Lily Evans. Dumbledore has to harshly rebuke him when he asks for Lily to be hidden as he did not care for James or Harry's life. He only asks for Lily to be spared.

Lily is the one bright spot on Snape's very dark canvas. Why doesn't he use Mudblood? Because it ruined his relationship with Lily. Why is he against Voldemort? Because he killed Lily and Harry is her legacy? Why does he protect Harry? Because of Lily.

*** In these types of discussions I tend to assume we're talking about the books, in which case they're exactly as hot as you imagine them to be.

And I'm not sure what we're supposed to do with Byronic antiheros other than give them redemption arcs. How is it better to judgementally hate them? They're /fictional characters/, they don't actually /deserve/ anything either way.

A lot of characterization is left up to the reader: whether the worst thing a character did was what was explicitly shown, or whether we can infer other misdeeds. What exactly their motivations were, and what brought them to that point.

But even so, why is it a bad thing to imagine a version of a character that is /better/ than what we get in canon? I don't understand where all this hate comes from.
