It was revealed that both Potter family & Gaunt family came from Peverell's related to third brother and second brother respectively. It's also known that Gaunt's are from Slytherin's. So did Peverell family come before Slytherin family or vice verca?

[Harry Potter Wiki] Godric's Hollow was famed as the birthplace of Godric Gryffindor, and also as the final resting place of at least one of the Peverell family.

Harry Potter Wiki also says, Peverell's are from 12th century. So we can assume Slytherin family came first & then Peverell's.

Now if Slytherin family came first, shouldn't it be logical that Potter's are related to Slytherin's via Peverell's? If so, Potter's are being Palselmouth shouldn't be uncommon. Perhaps, it was family secrect?


** Not necessarily. The Gaunts have both Slytherin and Peverell ancestry, likely through a Slytherin/Peverell marriage at some point (Cadmus Peverell's line). Ignotus Peverell is Harry's ancestor. That doesn't mean that Ignotus also had ties to Slytherin's bloodline. And it doesn't necessarily mean that all Potters are descended from Ignotus. As far as we know, the Gaunts were the last surviving heirs of Salazar Slytherin.

** After 1000 years in a small community everyone is related to Slytherin, and the other founders assuming any of them lived to have kids.

In fact after 1000 years most muggles would also be related to Slytherin. 2^{30(} 3 generations per century) is over a billion. If you want to use your idea in a fic go for it.

*** If a decendent of Slytherin marries a Peverell(probably 2nd brother), the family line can't be main Slytherin, can it be? But in HBP, the Gauntls use the ring as the symbol of Slytherin family, not Peverell family. This makes me question Slytherin decendent to Peverell marriage theory.

Perhaps, after leaving Hogwarts, Slytherin chanced his name to Peverell?(not a bad idea ðŸ˜›)

**** How so? If peverell has a kid, Slytherin has another, these two kids have a kid of their own, this new kid is desdendent of both Slytherin and Peverell, correct? That's what's happening here, just slightly more complicated

***** I get that. But my question remains same whether Gaunt's are from Slytherin main line or not.

Note that if we assume (among Peverell's decendent) only Gaunt's are Slytherin's decendent too. So it means the 2nd brother married into Slytherin.

Again, Morvolo Gaunt, used the ring of Peverell as a 'definitive' sign of Slytherin family.

Question is if wife of 2nd brother was Slytherin, definitely, Gaunt are not from Slytherin male line. So the ring shouldn't be a 'definitive' sign of Slytherin family.

If this is not the case, another case maybe 2nd Peverell brother are from Slytherin & by default all three brothers are from Slytherin male line & the 2nd brother inherited the ring. In that case, Potter family should be from Slytherin line too.

******* No, I believe Gaunt's are from both line. Question whether Gaunt are from Slytherin male line or female line.

If female why Peverell ring considered as a Slytherin family sign by the Gaunt's?

If male line, then either Peverell's are from Slytherin or 2nd brother's decendent, who also inherited the ring married into Slytherin family.

******** Female or male line? I still don't follow, but that's actually unrelated to the question you're asking. You seem to have been mistaken: Here is the excerpt of "Half Blood Prince" in question:

#+begin_quote
  For a moment, Harry thought Gaunt was making an obscene hand gesture, but then realized that he was showing Ogden the ugly, black-stoned ring he was wearing on his middle finger, waving it before Ogden's eyes. â€œSee this? See this? Know what it is? Know where it came from? Centuries it's been in our family, that's how far back we go, and pure-blood all the way! Know how much I've been offered for this, with the Peverell coat of arms engraved on the stone?"

**** You're an idiot. You think all Peverells born are male? That mpreg happened? Some descendent of each of the two Peverells that had the stone and the cloak had a daughter each. Those daughters each married a Potter and a Slytherin descendent. Those daughters were the heirs of the cloak and the stone and those items then went to their heirs, now named Potter and Slytherin respectively.

** Given the small number of purebloods and the timeframe we speak of, its well within the realm of possibilities that a majority of wizarding Britain is descendant from one or more Founders as well as the Peverells.

Given the vast interbreeding of purebloods, I can totally see parseltongue being something that just pops up from time to time in all old families, just like metamorphing is something that just appears in wizards and witches. Just like albino children have always gotten weird looks and myths around them, parseltongues may have a similar stigma in the wizarding world, not just because of Voldemort.

** Well I can't remember exactly what canon says about it but I do remember thinking that Rowling's grasp of heredity and genealogy was about on a par with her grasp of figures. They are families; Why should one come before the other? Presumably they married into each other as families did. The suggestion that the hereditary ability to speak parseltongue indicates a direct descent from Salazar Slytherin himself is an interesting one. If it started with a single mutation on a recessive gene, then for someone to inherit the ability, both parents would have to carry a copy of the gene and in order to do that, then both would have to be descended from Salazar. I have no problem with that at all. Most people who lived long enough to produce children in the 12th century probably have thousands of descendants still living now. This is a theory I am working through for a new fic and trying not to make it sound too dull. The idea that Harry was a parselmouth just because he had somehow been 'infected' by Voldemort is one that makes absolutely no sense to me and is far less interesting than the idea that he was indeed descended from Salazar. I could never understand why it was such a big deal.

It makes perfect sense, imo. Dumbledore said that Voldemort gave Harry a part of his powers and that was the ability to speak Parseltongue. The diary possessed the ability to resurrect Voldemort. I don't think it's far-fetched that the seventh horcrux gave Harry a magical ability.

I personally despise the genetic interpretation of magic, this silly notion that wizards have two magical alleles, squibs have one and muggles have none. It takes away from the magical nature of HP. It's magic, it doesn't need genetics and it can't be explained or contained by science.

**** Well I prefer to think of magic working within the world we live in, using forces we simply don't recognise, remember or understand, rather than being an alternative universe with a completely different set of rules. If that was the case I can't see why there would be any connection or contact between the two worlds, ever.

Calling it a 'Silly notion' is rather rude, to be honest. It's no sillier than your own preference and we are both talking about an imaginary world created for a children's fantasy. We will have to agree to differ on our views of the mechanics.

***** Let us not stop there, we still have two of the founders left. So, with Harry being a Slytherin descendant and Hermione being a Ravenclaw descendant, it's obvious that Ron is descended from Gryffindor; and as for Hufflepuff, hmm ... the other two person as important as the trio are Albus and Tom, and as Albus speaks against blood purity it clearly must be Tom who is of Hufflepuff descent.

There, makes perfect sense ... or rather, none at all. But at least writing this drivel brought me some amusement.

** Harry Potter takes place in the 1990's, and it is stated I think by Hermione that Hogwarts has been open for 1000 years. If we take that as true, then Slytherin was around in the Victorian Era. So the Perverell's would have already been established, and Slytherin married into the family.
