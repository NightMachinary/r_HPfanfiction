I was writing a fic featuring this concept, but I hit a roadblock. (Well, okay, I wrote 100k words, realized I had no idea where I was going, then also realized that there were several underlying problems that I needed to fix, but whatever.) What fics are out there that deal with the social impact of large numbers of people discovering a time traveler/dimensional traveler? (If it matters, in my scenario the occasion was a one-off, but I suppose I wouldn't mind reading about someone who could repeat the feat.)

Also, if anyone has any fics that really deal with the /emotional/ impact of time travel or dimensional travel (especially having to deal with knowing people that don't know you, and so on), I'd love to see other people's takes.

I'll gladly accept any type of serious fic, though the more enjoyable and well-written the fic is the better, of course.


** There is a fic (don't remember the name) where Potters from another dimension come into the "mostly canon" one. They're right prick but the public knows of their coming. Maybe someone has the name of this fic.

  In the aftermath of the Second Blood War its horrors still haunt the survivors, the country needs to be rebuilt and the last thing Harry Potter needed was a family of Potters from another dimension suddenly appearing.

** It's not a HP fanfic, but the Type-Moon universe has Kischur Zelretch Schweinorg, who is basically what you describe. He is treated like a global superpower all by his lonesome. Although he has been established like that for hundreds of years, and was not recently 'discovered'.

** Linkffn(A Step To The Right by CatsAreCool)

Harry and Hermione travel to an AU to the time just after Harry's parents have left Hogwarts. There are significant differences in character relations in this dimension, not to mention that family magic is also a thing. Both travelers, especially Harry, are deeply affected by facing people who've died in their world but are alive here.

  When Harry saves Hermione's life they end up in a different world and in the middle of another magical war - but at least they have each other.

  What happens when Harry Potter at age 29 is transported back in time with his family by a meddling phoenix? Well, when four of his kids are metamorphmagus, his better half is Andromeda Black and his sister-in-law, Narcissa Malfoy is on their side; the Wizarding World will not know what hit them. Begins in Prisoner of Azkaban, the start of book 3.
