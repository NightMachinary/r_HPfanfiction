1. no pedophile Voldemort (e.g. GoF AU)

like... Harry's only 14 and Voldemort already wants to fuck him shitty shit as if he went senile. I don't mind how old Harry is when it comes to Tomarry, but when it comes to Harrymort, I want to find a fic where Harry is at least 17 or so. Or do-over fic.

​

1. no dark!Harry

I'm tired of dark or apathetic harries. I've read too many such fics.

Light or Grey harries are rather refreshing to me.

​

1. good but independent/competent harry

okaaaay I must admit I'm quite picky about Harry's characteristics. But you know, competent harries are almost always dark harries and I don't believe I've read good but competent Harry fics all that much. When I say GOOD Harry, he's a nice person who has a clear sense of morality.

​

1. no crack fics

​

I liked all of Athey's works, of the Fictionist's, of MayMarlow's, Xerosis, October, WHGTB, Diagnosis, Children of the Revolution, his 28th life, the darkening of your soul. I know I'm asking too much but are there any good recs?

  It started as a game. When two highborn lords come looking for a distraction from boredom, they merge the worlds of the highest class with those of the lowest class. A careless invitation sets things in motion that were supposed to stay locked away.Because a kingdom on the verge of collapse, a noble without a past and a circus performer with a secret are not a good combination.

  Tom Riddle finds that he does not like it when Professor Potter doesn't pay him any attention. Something should be done about that.

#+begin_quote
  The Dark Lord divines what Harry Potter is in the Forbidden Forest, and revelations lead to incomprehensible consequences. Lord Voldemort has won... and the dystopia is damning. A tale of a fallen hero, dark desires, and a Dark Lord's obsession with something he has lost and finds himself unwillingly lusting after: a soul.
