I've just finished reading Astolot's House Proud and am really interested in reading anything else similar where the houses are somewhat alive. Preferably a Harry story not anyone else in particular though. Does anyone know of anything like this?

I really enjoyed the way the houses were humanised as such in that they felt neglect etc.

  After the war, life went on. Until it didn't. Desperate for survival, what's left of the wizarding populace plunges through the Veil into Westeros. Plagued with personal loss, the heroes from the last war integrate into a society without the Statute of Secrecy. It would be easier, if the magic here would acknowledge their existence.

** I've never read this House Proud, but there's a "sentient" house that plays a big part in linkffn(Number 6, Sanitarium Drive)

Ignoring the house though, this is a great fic in and of itself, it has really heartwrenching (and warming) moments and the OC( Jo) feels so real that I couldn't really not emphatize with her. Harry is wonderful here, really well depicted abused-child but not for too long to scar him so severely as in a lot of other works. It has a bigger plot, great world building, a really funny and sweet house-elf (not Dobby, also OC) and overall, lovely writing.

Just a heads-up, its quite heavy on the angst (not teenangst, overblown for no reason)

  Jo Delacroix: a mysterious neighbor, loner, drunk, hardened against the world. Harry Potter: orphan, unloved, abused, inexplicable events occur around him. Bonds can be made between the unlikeliest of individuals.
