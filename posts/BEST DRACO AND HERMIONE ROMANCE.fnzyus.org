Preferably multi-chapters. Realistic in romance, not cliche. 4th year and up to war and after war. BDSM/kink and trauma/emotional also preferred!!!

  Hermione Granger returns to Hogwarts to help rebuild the shattered castle the summer after the war. She and the other summer resident - and eventually their friends - have to come to terms with how the war broke more than just the walls of the building. Follows multiple Hogwarts students through '8th year' and one additional year of early adulthood. COMPLETE.

**** there are a few nsfw bits but nothing explicit. it's very much an ensemble-driven piece, focusing on Dramione along with other pairings and characters. believable growth and healing from trauma/mental stuff. it's long, but the prose is good and it's in nice, readable chunks; it's one of my favorite fics and i plan to reread it on Thursday.

the author has a LOT of Dramione fics, actually. i'd check out The Green Girl (more focus on Slytherin!Hermione growing up, but the Dramione is there and it's great), Lady of the Lake (political, fake dating/marriage turns to love, heavy Ron bashing), or The Pretense (the Death Eaters don't stop after Voldy dies, Draco and Hermione get fake married to spy on them for the Order)

  No one knows what happened to Draco Malfoy in the final battle, but, when his portrait shows up at Harry Potter's house, it's readily assumed he didn't make it. Hermione's perspective on the wizard starts to change as she learns more about who he really was. The more she knows, the more tragic his apparent demise seems to be. EWE Dramione
