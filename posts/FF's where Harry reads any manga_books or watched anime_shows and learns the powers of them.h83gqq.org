  The summer before his fifth year, Harry obtains a computer and an internet connection. Two months later, he emerges a changed person, for what has been seen cannot be unseen. AU with the whole Harry Potter timeline moved forward to the modern day. References to internet memes, video games, anime, etc.

** There's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10681251/1/Lightning-Dragon-s-Roar][/Lighting Dragon's Roar/ by Zero Rewind]], which has Harry inspired to learn Lightning Dragon Slayer magic from the manga, and eats electricity. It's also a massively AU crossover with several other IPs. it has not been updated since October of last year, though, as of this post.

There is also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9596404/1/Fairy-Tail][/Fairy Tail/ by Araceil]], which takes the same premise in a different direction, but unfortunately has been dead for even longer than /Lightning Dragon's Roar/.

  Harry takes inspiration from a manga called Fairy Tail, as well as the great creation we call "The Internet". What follows is a different path taken. A path of strife, rebellion, and above all, power. Welcome to the New Age. Timeline moved to the 2010s. Eventual X-over with Devil May Cry 3, Stargate: SG-1, Smallville, Dresden Files and Ranma.

  A 7 year old Harry stumbles on a box of old Naruto manga. Inspired, he reaches deep within, using chakra to quickly become a phenomenal ninja. And thus begins a curious tale. Read and see how it ends! Read 1st chapter A/N...story is officially abandoned.
