This is a huge guilty pleasure of mine so I'd love to see Harry going to the alley at 11 years old and spending his immense fortune on cool gizmos and bottomless featherweight apartment-size trunks with 12 potion labs. Bashing is okay but I'd rather not see too much of it. Thanks!


** I'm actually reading a fic like this right now, but I would recommend reading the first part of this series before. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10653495/1/The-Cupboard-Series-2-Hermione-s-Book-Nook][The Cupboard Series 2: Hermione's Book Nook]]
