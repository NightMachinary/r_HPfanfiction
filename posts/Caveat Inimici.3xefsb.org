Came across [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/681510/chapters/1250112][this]] while going through an old post about Dark Hermione fics that I'd saved. Shiver-inducing. Read it! Read it now!


** Seconded. This is amazing. I still remember the first time I read this one.

  Hermione is a sister to Harry, a mother to Rose and Hugo, a wife to Ron, and a Legilimens and Unspeakable. She is also very, very angry. A look at a Hermione who developed the instincts she evidenced with Marietta Egdecombe and Dolores Umbridge. AU, though canon compliant. *Drama/horror. COMPLETE.*

      This piece is posted under my old profile name on FF\.net\. As that profile notes, after a colleague sent a link to that profile to several other colleagues, I moved all but two of my fics to a new profile, which shares the name I use here\.A/N: This story arrived from nowhere, hopped on my back and took up a very great deal of my time\. Less a plot bunny and more a plot gorilla\. Or, if you like, a plot walrus\. Story notes and acknowledgments afterward\.
