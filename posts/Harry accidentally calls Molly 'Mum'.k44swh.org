** I fiercely believe that Harry started calling her Mum after he married Ginny. Maybe first time was an accident but after that he just rolled with it. Like:

"It was the first christmas after Harry and Ginnys wedding. They all gathered together in the Burrow. Not that much changed after Ginny became a Potter. Really, Harry was part of the family ever since the twins and Ron broke him out of his room at the Dursleys with a flying Ford Anglia.\\
And so like every year Harry stood in the kitchen with Molly. Other than at the Dursleys where he hated chores he wanted to do them here. It just wasn't fair that one person had to do everything for all of them. Especially now when "close" family meant a gathering with about twenty people with Bill, Percy and George having kids already. So Harry cut the carrots while Molly roasted the meat.\\
"Can you do me a favor, dear?", Molly asked.\\
"Sure, what is it, Mum?", Harry asked back and froze for a second. He hadn't meant to call her mum. It just slipped out. Molly looked up and for a moment he was sure there were tears in her eyes. He was gratefull she didn't mention it any further when she said: "Please set the table. And tell the others they have to help, too!"\\
And after he went out of the kitchen into the Garden where they put up a heated tent so that everyone of their big family had enough space, hearing all of them talking, laughing and joking, he thought that calling Molly mum was the only right thing to do."

Sorry for my English. Not my first language.

*** Beautiful. I firmly believe Harry should have named his daughter after Molly for the role she played in his life.

**** I think he would have done it but Percy had his daughter first and two (three) Mollys would have been very confusing.

** Seeing how she fulfilled a role Petunia should've, that's not really surprising.
