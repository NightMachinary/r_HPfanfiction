#+TITLE: Two-prong post. LF closest as possible to RL romance fics (no slash and no H/Hr). How much do you think that romance in fanfiction is applicable to RL ? (As in, RL issues and arguments and reasons to be together or break-up) ?

** It really depends on your overall situation (country, age, popularity, sex, looks). Take "Whatever happened to Bromance" as an example. In that Story, Cormac convinces Harry to sleep with Romilda Vane because she is hot and has the hots for him. Stuff like that is pretty realistic for, let's say a university party. Or spring break in Florida. But it won't do you any good in middle school.

The second thing you have to keep in mind is that a significant amount of works omit certain parts in order to be more romantic. For example, you can bet a large sum that Harry did not only stare at Cho from a distance, but also wanked to some fantasy of her naked on top of him. And just because he had a crush on Cho that does not mean he didn't fantasise about Hermione, Angelina, Tonks or anyone else.

*** Yeah, for all the violence and deaths and grief in the series, the rest of the stuff was pretty much PG. Today's YA books might have progressed a bit in this respect

**** I think it also came from the fact that Rowling herself was not entirely sure where she was going with the series (transition from Children's book to YA).

****** Ha! Gave me a good little chuckle, that one!

I can't believe how we got to this stage. Growing up, when the books were first coming out, JKR was like this infallible god to me. I mean, in high school, I literally would try to argue that the HP series was superior to all other fantasy books because I was under the illusion that there were no plot-holes in the books and that she had an explanation for everything. Cut to the hot piece of garbage that was Cursed Child (and add a healthy dose of reading discussions on Reddit) and now I find myself unable to stop cracking the occasional joke on an author I worshiped as a kid.

*** Most kids that I went to school with were already having sex, whether oral or penetration, at the age of 12-13. Granted, where I'm from, that age /is/ considered to be middle school age. People seem to forget how often teenagers start humping. The moment hormones kick in, you can guarantee they're at it.

When I studied for a novel I'm writing, a common age was around 14. Masturbation (in boys) started between 11 and 13. In fact, what I also gathered is that the older they got, sex sort of just dropped off. It would restart somewhere again around 15 and then drop off again. I have no idea, though. It's different for everyone.

Also, you misjudge how quickly some people will jump into bed with someone because they've been told to. It's frighteningly more common in boarding schools. I can attest to that. The one I went to was all-boys', too. The girls' school was down the road and you'd always see the students sneaking off, ditching classes.

Part two is decent. A lot of people forget that boys (and girls) tend to masturbate and fantasize. It can play good into a failed relationship, too.

On that note, I may as well contribute. One true love doesn't work and is horrid. Sure, some people find their perfect spouse, but most other people date other people. OP mentioned no slash, so I won't bother on the same-sex fling/hook-up when drunk and the clich√© admitting feelings while having sex with someone else. Good angst.

"Whatever happened to Bromance" gave me HIMYM vibes. If you try to pull a Barney in Middle School, you will just make a fool out of yourself.

** The romance of how they got together can be pretty normal... the staying together is boring, so a lot of that is probably made up...

Actually... the getting together can be pretty boring also for a "normal" romance. Fiction doesn't normally show us how things are, but how we wish they could be.
