OK! I'm trying this writing thing out! My first ever fan-fiction!

​

Just released a first chapter. I realize i'm not the most gifted writer out there, albeit i'm still quite young, but if you liked / disliked it, please let me know what you think! Should i continue this? I've got a grand adventure planned out and a bucket-load of free-time, but if it's not up -to-standard, i guess there's not much point.

​

All responses appreciated, hope you enjoy!

** Your story doesn't really interest me since aftermath of canon, as in slice of life, isn't what I'm looking for in fanfiction. Especially with Ginny pairing as it seems to be? But I still eyed it through and read here and there. English isn't my first language and I don't really know much about writing, but I thought I could give some feedback.

Your writing wasn't off-putting and I liked that the pov didn't change erratically which is annoying and confusing and too common in fanfictions. What I disliked was adverbs. For example: "asked Harry, quizzically" and "nodded appreciatively." How do you nod appreciatively? And "asked Harry" is sufficient.

Those are few quick things I noticed. Don't know if they even hold any weight. Still if this catered to my interests more I would probably read it even with few annoyances. I have grown used to them by reading great many fics with miserable writing. Is it up to standard? I would say for a fanfic it is good enough and you can only get better.

E: I forgot to say that I think you should continue. I have had a few ideas and after searching I haven't found them in a fic. So I have contemplated that maybe I should write my own fic to be able to read about them. So essentially I would be writing for myself. And you should write for yourself too.

** Haven't read the fic as I don't read stuff on Wattpad , you should probably post to FFN and AO3 as that's the sites most HP fanfic readers and writers frequent , on Wattpad the text has all sorts of annoying things on the tops and sides of the text and it's compressed down to a few words per line , while on FFN and AO3 it's just mostly plain text , which makes it nicer to read.
