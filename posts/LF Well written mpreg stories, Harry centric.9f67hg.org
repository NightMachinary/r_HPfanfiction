  but if there's one character I can't imagine not having children, it's Harry

Why not simply adopt an orphan? That would certainly go well with Harry's character and experiences.

That's the whole point of Surrogacy. You get a woman, impregnate her (through the natural, the artificial or, in this case, the magical way), she carries the child to term and then hands it over to the parents.
