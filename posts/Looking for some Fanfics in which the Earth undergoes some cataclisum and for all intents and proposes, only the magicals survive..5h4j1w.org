There can be a little bit of leeway in which a few hundred muggles live, but the muggle world is at an end. There should be far more magical's now.

  Tom Riddle was fully expecting to stay in hell forever. But the brat-who-lived and friend has, of course, come along with an offer too tempting to refuse. Albus Dumbledore was fully expecting Harry Potter's name down for the next year at Hogwarts. He just wasn't expecting two Dark-Lords to be enrolling as well. Time-travel -sort of- and FemHarry

** linkffn(Sole Survivor) is about a disease that kills pretty much all of the muggles in Europe and Britain. It's fairly well written, although it ends at a kinda weird place.

  I never imagined that they'd do it; launch the bombs. Now that they have, I am forced to deal with my wife's murder and finding my son, all while having a chance to make this post-apocalyptic Commonwealth a better place by any means necessary. It is not the world I wanted, but it is the world I found myself in. Anyone who tries to get in my way is going to lose. I guarantee it.
