My notes: Excellent plot & fanon. full of feels. Author's first language is not English, which manifests as incorrect usages and misspellings. However, they become fewer as time goes on, and they are few enough overall that a half-hour or so of ctrl+R-ing would render the grammar rating excellent.

  After killing Voldemort during seventh year, Harry vanished without a trace. But now, 8 years later, a deadly secret forces him to return and it seems that only Snape will be able to save him. SSHP, no slash

** Some of the fics by DrT, who is found on fictionalley and was on ficwad. At least I think the Old Believers he used in a variety of his fics were either Druids or at least based on such.
