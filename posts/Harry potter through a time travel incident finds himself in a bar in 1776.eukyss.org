****** Sure, but it was also never 'illegal' until 2010. It was the slave trade specifically that was abolished in the British Empire in the 1830s or so. Everything else we usually do with slavery, kidnapping and illegal imprisonment and whatnot, that was illegal early on, but actually owning another person wasn't illegal until 2010.

Legally speaking, we didn't really consider it a state of being, so we had no laws against it.

We did do pretty well with suppressing it once we cottoned onto the whole immorality thing. Got a bunch of laws passed and treaties signed that let us use our navy to police the Atlantic Trade Routes for slavers and kick them in the balls when we found 'em. We were the second biggest trader in the Atlantic Triangle, so don't romanticise us too much. We were twats, back in those days. Or bigger twats, at least. The jury is out on us nowadays.

******* Slavery wasn't really abolished because of immorality. Slavery was bad for working men, and slaves were increasingly fighting back against their masters. It was abolished mostly for economic reasons- as well as because people increasingly opposed it.

The British really cling to the idea that it was just a nice thing they decided to do one day. But that was actually great when it came to the American Civil War, because the English people already really believed their own stories and refused to help save slavery.

******** Quite true, though that mostly would've been what counted for morality, back in those days. :)

At least something good came of our moderate denial. :D

***** What the English did to Australia is now considered not only a genocide, but one that is essentially ongoing. People like to ignore what happened to Indigenous Australians because the English never actually left, so their descendants got to control the entire narrative. They didn't have slaves because they had colonies which were easily exploited.

All this to say that I would've rather not been invaded by anyone, let alone the British.

***** Buddy, that was word for word taken from your post. It's implied that Britain treated it's natives better than the US when that's clearly not the case.

It's a fun little scenario of time travel, but let's not pretend that British mercantilist policy didn't start the slave trade, inspire many a famine and massacre, and all around fuck up the middle east with arbitrary lines drawn in the sand.

**** If we really want to point fingers, then the Conquistadors and Smallpox probably take most of the blame for Native Americans dying off.

The US westward expansion was just icing on the cake.
