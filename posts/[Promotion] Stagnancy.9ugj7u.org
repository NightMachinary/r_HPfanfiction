A self promotion of my NaNoWriMo project that probably won't be finished in NaNoWriMo. I wanted to take a realistic approach to a Dark Golden Trio, similar to linkffn(The Sum Of Their Parts), but from a pre-canon change, rather than a post-canon change. And one that isn't, "The Dursley abuse Harry and now he's a sociopath".

Dumbledore and Grindlewald both die as a result of their famous duel, and without the implied challenge of Dumbledore, Tom Riddle underestimates and is killed by Marvolo Gaunt. Without the two greatest harbingers of change, the Wizarding World of Britain takes the path of least resistance. Harry, Ron and Hermione will force it to change.

The story starts in 6th year and will continue past Hogwarts.


** Hey that was really cool, I like the story so far. Nice to see another Dark Trio fic, Sum of Their Parts is the only on I really know about. Hope to see more soon.

*** Thanks! A lot of Dark Trio stuff just devolves into sociopathic characters and Greater Good nonsense, trying to go for a balanced vibe.

**** Why are sociopathic characters so common in fanfiction? Especially SI's. It's like teenagers romanticize this nonsense

** That's pretty nifty I would say, edgy take-over-the-world things are cool if well written.

  Without the two greatest wizards of the 20th century, the Wizarding World has stagnated. Harry, Ron and Hermione will force this uncaring world to conform to their beliefs.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
