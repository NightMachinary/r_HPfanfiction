Are there any fics out there of OCs (or even non ocs) just having fun and playing around with magic? Like mucking around in the black lake and like building a rope swing into the water. Or like doing fun dares and brave stuff? I would love to read something like this.


** Hmm. Not sure if this fits your criteria, but there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][/Oh God Not Again/ by Sarah1281]], which basically has Harry Potter ending up accidentally going back in time, and deciding to do whatever he wants. His goals: beat Voldemort with fewer deaths this time around, have fun, and lose the house cup.

Another one I enjoyed by the same author is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate][/When in Doubt, Obliviate/]], in which Harry is taken and adopted by Gilderoy Lockhart(and ironically enough, more closely fits your criteria I think).

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  When a chance meeting reveals Harry's planned fate to Lockhart, he knows what he has to do: rescue him and raise him as his own to properly manage his celebrity status. Harry gets a magical upbringing, Lockhart gets the Boy-Who-Lived...everybody wins!

** It's not all fun and games, but Harry does get a chance to be a kid in linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7). I'm particularly fond of how he cheats at hide and seek, and brings Hermione to visit after school while letting Sirius think she's a muggle, so he races around hiding everything magical and stresses about having to wipe her memory after she sees a dropped wand.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

** I'm going to recommend Mischief's Heir linkao3(4629198) and Ninja Wizard linkao3(10824855) both by mad_fairy. They both have fairly involved plots, which may not be what you want, but they both have lots and lots of scenes of kids just playing with magic. Harry wants to sail a boat on the Black Lake, so he looks up how to build a boat and then does it. He wants to mine asteroids so he makes little action figure people to go into space for him. There's a craft fair where all the kids make dollhouses/model houses of what their dream home would look like. And so on.

Don't worry about the crossovers, either. There's nothing in the Marvel fic you can't get from a basic understanding of Norse mythology (Loki=god of mischief, Odin=king of the gods). I've never seen Naruto and I had no trouble keeping up with that crossover.

** Only things I've seen like this is the fanfiction 'Make a wish'

and two webtoon stories that fit the EXACT criteria and feeling of what you are asking for:

Hooky

and

The Steam Dragon Express

They both happen in a magical world that is different but also has parallels with Harry Potter, but not enough to make it exact, and different enough to make it extremely interesting.

Just like the HP series, they both start off obliviously happy, but end up caught in the middle of a war, and also value freindship and love in the middle of the war, but they are still really different and unique, so it's not a copy - it actually feels more like a fanfiction AU.
