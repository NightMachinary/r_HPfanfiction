Like it says in the title, I'm looking for fics where Voldemort manipulates Harry as the main part of the plot, whether through his horcrux, the diary, him managing to get hold of Harry and mess with his head etc. But most of what I'm finding ends up with him abusing harry in a sexual way and I can't read that.


** These two are a bit funny and not as dark as it seems you might want. Basically, the horcrux in Harry's head wakes up and gives terrible advice.

  Voldemort smiled. It was a cold, creeping thing. Truly human despite it being on a serpentine face.And it was then Harry could see the real Lord Voldemort. Not the madman throwing curses around indiscriminately, but the man who had lured legions of purebloods to his cause, Tom Riddle who had blinded all his teachers bar one.It was calculating. The long-game personified.--Harry would never have guessed that his animagus would have been a snake. Nor the trouble it would bring when Voldemort found out. After all, who needs to kill an enemy when you can keep them?

  Amidst the stresses of his fifth school year, the horcrux within Harry begins to become sentient; its intentions unclear but possessiveness evident. Consequently, things take a dark turn as Halloween approaches.
