It seems that HP magic can indeed create permanently airborne bases/vehicles, considering Arthur Weasley made one during his spare time. A highly mobile, airborne vehicle that can fly at high altitude and portkeyable seem to me like the perfect command center, hideout, lair, or whatever you want to call it.

Are there fics that feature this particular kind of creations?


** Considering that you can travel instantaneously and hide buildings from the face of the earth, the benefits of an airborne command centre/hideout/lair are not really there. Also, there's a good chance you could trigger the early warning satellites and accidentally start WWIII

*** Good point, but I assume they should invent some wards to avoid radar detection. Also, expansion charms allow them to have much smaller outside area.

Hiding building is overrated if your enemies target an entire map grid with nukes, fiendfyre, and other area effective spells/weapons.

Finally, apparition, floo, and portkey could all be blocked. Airborne bases on the other hand could be anywhere in the world.

**** I am not even talking about radar (and given how "educated" the average pureblood is, I doubt the ones in power have ever heard of it, much less know how to counter it). The closest we came to nuclear annihilation was when a Soviet satellite detected the reflection of the sun near the American coast. That is the kind of fluke you have to account for.

***** Why do you assume these ships were made by ignorant British purebloods?

Why do you assume these ships were made during the height of the Cold War?

Remember, any fic that includes these creations will be AU. And in such AUs, I can perfectly assume that Wizards are not those arrogant and ignorant imbeciles depicted in a children's series with tons of “useless adults” trope.

And I can just as equally assume that at least the purebloods are still as ignorant as in canon. The argument works both ways.

The early warning systems are still in place and the counterstrike would be launched either way, no matter if it's 1970 or 2025.

*** You're really discounting the Cool Factor. :)

The ICW needs to have a magical version of the SHIELD Helicarrier, magically hidden from Muggles technology and detection. Has all the amenities, including an on-craft artificial beach with a pseudo-ocean thanks to an Undetectable Extension Charm. Anything less is just a waste of magic. >:(

****** Hogwarts is a castle in the middle of some mountains. The other is an equally sized object flying all over the place. The carrier resort would have a higher risk of detection because if Hogwarts wards fail for a minute, no one would notice. Meanwhile, a Hogwarts sized object floating above Diego Gracia or Sydney would be rather noticeable, even if it is just visible for a minute.

******** Because Hogwarts isn't moving and sits in an area with rather poor radar coverage (and modern radar can find "holes" and similar anomalies in the background radiation, so simply building it stealthy won't do the trick).

Also, you want to go where the people and governments are, which happens to be in the big cities like London.

********* Why would enchantments that hide Hogwarts result in detectable holes in radar coverage? That such things can be made to completely evade sight (or in some cases, even to seem to fold space so physical detection is just impossible) suggests radar would not spot it at all.

  It's ideal for Headquarters, of course. My father put every security measure known to wizardkind on it when he lived here. It's unplottable, so Muggles could never come and call --- as if they'd ever have wanted to
