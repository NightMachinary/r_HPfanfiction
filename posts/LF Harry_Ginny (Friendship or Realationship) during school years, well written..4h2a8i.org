Read the very popular Harry/Ginny fics Backwards like with Purpose but haven't been able to find many good ones that weren't post-HBP or post-canon.


** These authors write decent Harry/Ginny romance fics:

** linkffn(Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince) has some cool moments between the two, but it's mostly just Ginny.

  The story of "Harry Potter and the HBP", but told from the 3rd person POV of Ginny Weasley. Strictly in-canon. Suitable for anyone whom the "Harry Potter" novels themselves would be suitable for.
