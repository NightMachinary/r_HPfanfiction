I don't know about others but I see this thing in many fanfics and it irritates me. I mean it is implied that Hannah and Susan are friends but nowhere is it said that they were from the age of 4 or 5. Same with Daphne Greengrass and Tracey Davis. I mean for God's sake they could be friends from Hogwarts years.

And in some other fanfics like Sirius raises Harry or James and Lily are alive or a godmother drops all of a sudden, he meets all of Hogwarts students his year before going there. I mean even Hermione. To make sure of that they develop some ridiculous story where whoever is taking care of him takes him to the dentist or they are neighbours and suddenly see her doing magic and go all Hagrid "You're a wizard" mode for a moment and start explaining everything. And to prove everything they blatantly break the International Statute of Secrecy and show magic to them.

And everyone's parents went Hogwarts together. Like James Potter, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, Peter Pettigrew, Crabbe Senior, Goyle Senior, Lucius Malfoy, Bellatrix Black, Narcissa Black, Andromeda Black, Xenophilus Lovegood,Luna's mother(some imaginary name), Lily Potter, Alice Longbottom, Frank Longbottom, Daphne Greengrass's mother and father (imaginary names) and Tracey Davis's parents(imaginary names) all went to Hogwarts together. I mean is there not any other batch in the 'Marauder's Era'.


** The Harry having Hermione parents as dentists is the Ol' Reliable of Harmony shippers.

Agree with this. Even in next gen fics where Rose goes to school with Erasmus Finnigan, Harvati Patil, Sean Thomas, Perry Boot, Ender Brown and Bernie Macmillan.

And Luna's mother;s name was Pandora... or was that fandom?

** Yeah, I feel the same when I'm reading Marauders-Era fics, and suddenly, everyone from the First Order of the Phoenix is in Lily and James' year, and of course, they all are in Gryffindor. Like, does make sense for Dumbledore to create the Order and including only kids who just graduated?

Not to mention all those Lily and James live or Sirius raises Harry fics where the Weasleys are brought in almost immediately, just to make sure Harry has a love interest from the age of 2 and a best friend.

*** Adding on to this I've seen fanfic's where Lily & Molly knew each other & were close in the Order during the first war. Like was Molly & Arthur ever apart of the Order during the first war? IIRC Fabian & Gideon were.

All that to ensure Harry has a love interest & a best friend while still in diapers like you stated above.

** To play devil's advocate a bit here, you have two generational wars that would play into baby-booms / consolatory familial partnerships that would play out as if everyone in the population were part of a small town of a few tens of thousands of people, though spread out across a whole country, which isn't a huge issue where magic is involved.

Three big wars if you count Grindelwald / WW2.

So, tons of people start dying. You and your family start getting very close with other families with worldviews similar to your own, because you need a support network in dangerous times. War ends, baby boom as people sense social relief and all these new connections (literally) foster in the next generation, another dark wizard rises, rinse and repeat.

Inclusion of muggle-borns would be weird, yeah, but for close-knit wizarding families, the acquaintances and friendships across generations of families makes some sense given the context and populations involved.

*** i mean, portkeys and Apparation is faster than using a car so i assume distance isnt a problem, add that you homeschool your kids, you most likely will arrange play dates with other parents, presumably pepole you are close to or who share simular political views as you. Weasleys were part of the order social network through Mollys siblings, even if they werent involed in the war

** Isn't it canon that Hogwarts is the only magical school in Britain? It makes sense that everyone from the older generation would know each other from their school years. Not to mention Malfoy and his gang, or Crabbe and Goyle at least, seem to have known each other before Hogwarts. I do agree it's ridiculous for EVERYONE to meet before Hogwarts, but the wizarding community seems to be very small and close knit, so it's not outside the realm of possibility.

*** Yes but Lucius Malfoy was born in 1954 James Potter in 1960 so that's probably like an entire generation gap for wizards. And James was like a first is when Lucy was in his seventh year. In many fanfics of Marauder's Era they show that James Potter had a rivalry of sorts with Lucius Malfoy too. And in Lily and James raise Harry fics, whenever Harry tells them about his meeting with Draco Malfoy, they say just like his father. How could they know they were just together for one year. (AND THOSE WHO SAY THAT HE WAS AN ORDER MEMBER SO HE KNEW HIN TO BE A DEATH EATER, not all death eaters went about showing their face in daylight. They wore masks. That's why it was easy to claim Imperius curse)

**** i mean in according with the Lucius thing, it could be that we get the perspective from Sirius pov since he grew up around that crowd, his cousin marrying him for instance.

But it lacks the imagination since the closest we get James rival to be during his school years is Snape, not any other person

** Hogwarts is a famous school in Britain, so while annoying, it would make sense a lot of people know each other and become friends at Hogwarts or before Hogwarts.

With the Half-Bloods, it'd depend on how often the parents visit the Wizarding World.

With Muggleborns, it wouldn't make sense for them to know magical people before going to school.
