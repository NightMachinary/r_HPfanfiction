Overused challenges taken a different direction, a twist you've thought of but never seen written, an interesting magical theory that could be fleshed out into a story - what idea would you like to see turned into a story?

So I posted [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3eulrj/whats_a_story_you_would_really_like_to_read/][this]] same topic a month ago and it seemed to do pretty well. So I thought I'd post it again.

Some new ideas from last time would be good. If anyone wants to run with one of these ideas, let us know because that would be awesome.


** Wrong Boy-Who-Lived story. Harry is the wrong BWL

On the night of the attack, James and Lily survive. Dumbledore, showing the savvy and deviousness he's known for (earned or otherwise), decides the best idea is to leak it that Harry is the BWL, not his brother. James and Lily go along with this because they know about the prophecy and want to protect Twin.

One day, a young Harry finds out about the prophecy. Scared, but determined, he sets out to improve himself.

Cut forward to summer of 94,5,6,or7. Twin is basically a nicer, smarter, mini-James (think canon Harry but happier and more well adjusted).

Harry doesn't go to Hogwarts. He convinced his parents to send him to a more... battle oriented school. They figured it can't hurt, and he'll also be there to protect Twin when it comes out that Harry isn't BWL. They justify not readying Twin because they want to spend as much time with him as possible in case he dies defeating Voldemort.

James and Lily don't have a particularly close relationship with Harry, but they're not mean - they just find it hard to relate when he's so focused on the prophecy and nothing else. They convince themselves that they can make it up to Harry afterwards.

Their marriage is also struggling because James was never really comfortable with the idea but Lily is pushing for it because she can't bare to think about Twin dying which seems like a likely outcome. James tries to connect with Harry with flying, but even though Harry's excellent he feels he doesn't have time for quidditch and he's not interested in pranks.

Basically the story would focus on the shit hitting the fan when Voldemort is resurrected. Everything comes out, that Twin is actually the BWL, Dumdledore's manipulations, James and Lily's complicity. The twins both feel like they've been living lies and end up coming together against the world.

Fairly similar to linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi) but with the focus not on Harry's time at this other school. More on the relationships and interactions between the characters after the lies are found.

Basically I've grown bored of the tired Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived stories and so I thought turning it on its head could be fun. Them letting everyone think Harry is the BWL to protect Twin has probably been done before but if it has I haven't read it.

***** Yeah but why would Dumbledore want to /set mass murderers after an innocent child?/

Of course, it's likely that he had done it in canon, since despite lack of other witnesses, everyone seemed to know that Harry caused Voldemort's downfall and that he has a certain scar on his forehead. But in canon he'd have trouble with Voldemort either way. In your idea, he'd just suffer as a decoy - even worse than suffering as a sacrificial lamb.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** A time-travel fic where Harry doesn't know he traveled back in time.

At first he doesn't know what is happening, he just has flashes of memories here and there and feels attracted to (insert ship you want here) for no apparant reason. Gradually he solves the mystery and starts using those memories and starts acting on those feelings he has. He changes and matures very quickly because of this which has other consequences. In the end he finds out how he traveled back in time and I would love it to be a very shocking reason (betrayal? impending and irreversible death and he wanted more time? He struck a deal with the devil (metaphorically)?).

*** Oh, I've had this exact thought too!

I always imagined a scene for a comedy version:

Start of GoF, at the Burrow, morning of World Cup.

Hermione or Ginny come up to wake Harry and Ron up. Harry has been having dreams and flash... forwards? about having being married for awhile now. They shake his arm to wake him up and he pulls them into the bed, and into a spooning position "Come back to bed, honey".

It'd be pretty funny. Bonus points if Harry wakes up and says "You're not /[blank]/! What are you doing in my bed?" before they have a chance to get over their shock of being pulled into his bed.

** I would really like to read more stories that follow the idea of a character or group of characters traveling to a different dimension, but with the difference being that instead of that dimension still being the Wizarding World, just with a few alterations, it would be something completely new and different and /not/ a crossover.

Stories that incorporate something similar to this would be linkffn(By the Divining Light by enembee), one of the best fics ever made where Harry and Dumbledore travel to the world of Old Magic, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbonë by enembee), where Harry doesn't end up in a different dimension, just a part of the world that has been left to its own devices, linkffn(Harry Potter and the World Beneath by Tellemicus Sundance), where Harry ends up in a pocket dimension still stuck in the dinosaur age and linkffn(In Atlantean Caves by obstacle1), where they end up in an underground maze of some sort, also set in an Old World type of setting like By the Divining Light, although more focused on relationships and themes of isolation.

The thing I hate most of all about this is that these are the only stories I've ever found that really fit the description of the type of story I want to read the most, and all of them are incomplete and probably abandoned. Valbonë is close to completion (it's only missing an epilogue), and By The Divining Light is complete; it has a sequel, Conlaodh's Song, which is also complete, but Book 3 was never published.

It just sucks that the stories I want to read the most are also the ones that have never been told in their entirety.

** Harry uses his immense fame to, you know, actually do something. Maybe not in books 1 and 2, where he's an abused introverted child trying to grow out of that shell, but perhaps after that?

What does he do?

- Politically: publically (and naively) support a few causes. (House-elf stuff maybe?) Make a lot of mistakes, get manipulated by others, and so on, but gain experience in the public domain.

- Socially: keep a wide and varied circle of friends. Get some early sexual experience without all that puritanical, one-love bullshit that so many fanfics sprout.

- Get some drive: His family is famous for being highly intelligent, powerful and opposed to Voldemort. He's enormously famous for an act he doesn't know he can replicate. He should, I feel, be affected by something analogous to the Dunning--Kruger effect, and, ideally (though in comic and tragic stories you can explore the alternatives) be motivated to be better, while being continually sceptical of his prowess. At the same time, he's not prodigious, so let him not be a hundred years above his grade level, yeah?

Basically, a Harry that is profoundly affected by all the fame Dumbledore wanted to keep him away from, rather than it being mostly an afterthought. Generally, the only stories I've seen this done in are Slytherin!Harry stories where's so uber-competent it's cringe worthy.

** I've been thinking about writing a Harry that's much more curious than he was in canon, getting sorted in Ravenclaw instead.

Curious isn't exactly the right word, though. I'd write him to ask 'why?' a lot more. Why am I famous? Why are some people wizards and others aren't? Why does magic work the way it does? That sort of thing. It'd be a pretty long time until he actually gets something of an answer, though. Or enough of one that it'd satisfy him.

I'd write Harry as having more friends, but their bonds are less deep, y'know? I'd planned for Harry to accidentally grab some sort of cursed book and one of his friend group 'rescuing' him. He keeps in contact with Ron, but they just naturally drift apart. Harry doesn't make the Quidditch team, either. Most of the plot from PS is skipped, so I'd have to insert my own. I was thinking about an OC prefect who'd dabbled in a bit of forbidden knowledge thanks to Quirrel's meddling, which would also be where the aforementioned book would come from.

There are other elements I want to include - whoever I'd choose to be Harry's friend would have someone who dabbled in philosophy as a father.

No plans beyond first year yet, though.

** I've had an idea for a pre-DH-AU story, but I'm not a good enough writer to do it justice. It's a time-travel story with a twist: somehow (maybe on purpose?) Snape travels forward in time from his school days and is able to hide his identity from everyone. To his surprise, the war is still on, Voldemort is still a threat, and he eventually finds out that his future self has killed Dumbledore. He slowly (and probably reluctantly) gets more and more involved in the war effort on the side of the Light, but never becomes trusted enough to be involved in the details of how to actually off the Dark Lord. He does hear at least some of the prophecy, and is aware that Harry is the only way to permanently kill Voldemort. The final battle comes (probably at Hogwarts, because we all love a great cliche) and in the midst of the fighting he clearly sees Voldemort kill Harry. At that same moment he is thrust back into his original time (probably an accident this time).

With certain knowledge of Voldemort's victory, he finally accepts the advances/offer of the Death Eaters and firmly ingratiates himself with the winning side. He tells Voldemort about Harry and the prophecy, which leads to Voldemort going after the Potters with a vengeance.

With time, guilt finally eats away at him enough that he discovers he does have a conscience, and that he'd rather die doing what's "right" rather than be on the winning side at the price of continuing to support such a terrible leader/cause. He goes to Dumbledore and agrees to be a spy (I came up with this before DH came out, so the whole pining-after-Lily thing wasn't a thing yet, but that's ok because I never really liked that twist anyway).

Years later, again at the final battle but this time as an adult, he again sees Voldemort kill Harry. But this time, because he wasn't whisked back into the past immediately afterward, he also sees that it was an intentional part of the Order's plan and causes Voldemort's destruction. (I'm a little fuzzy on the details here, which is part of the reason I've never tried to write this story. Originally my idea was to have Harry survive because of some kind of preparations or ritual or something and he kills Voldemort while he's gloating, but I also thought about Harry's death by Voldemort's hand making Voldemort mortal, and thus able to be killed by someone else.) So Snape's life-changing decision to join the Death Eaters was based on his future "knowledge" that Voldemort would win in the end, and it turns out he was completely wrong.

** I really want there to be a crossover where the wizarding world is real but Harry Potter isn't. If I wrote it, it'd be either a crossover with either Castle or Marvel, because those are my favorites, but I'm not super picky. (Sherlock could be fun too) Basically, this is the backstory: in the late seventies, muggle use of cameras, computers, and fancy surveillance stuff is growing more prolific, and muggles themselves are getting more difficult to reliably avoid. Maybe the magic world notices this trend, or (which seems more likely) a seer who is not Trelawney and whose Sight is therefore different, predicts that if nothing changes muggles will discover the wizarding world within [insert some random number here. maybe 20? 30?] years. The ICW convenes to discuss this, and decide to hold a writing competition for the best story about the wizarding world they can find. Cue JK Rowling, a struggling squib author. Harry Potter wins the competition and now any witch or wizard who is noticed as being strange can explain themselves as being a die-hard HP fan. It's fairly true that people don't look any farther if they have an answer readily available, and really, very few people are going to think MAGIC!!! instead of NERD!!!

In this, HP canon is more flexible. The only parts which have to be adhered to are the language, the styles, and the way that magic is performed. Maybe Hogwarts doesn't even exist? Maybe the 'real' muggleborn rights movement/conflicts were part of the civil rights movement in the 1960s? There's a lot of places that I feel this could go.

** Anarchist!Harry. He was breaking the laws of magic as a nappy-wetting baby, what are mortal man's or wizarding laws to tell him what to do. Probably would have run away from the Dursleys' and lived on the streets, stealing, pickpocketing, general hooliganery. Mayhaps learned a thing or two of wandless magic, or discovers some odd magical shop hidden in muggle London, or magical books in a second-hand shop.

Discovering all the gold in his vault when Hagrid escorts him through Diagon Alley, he buys some kind of extremely magical creature to bring with him, instead of a measly bird or cat. Runespoor? Cerberus puppy? That wolfhound-sized spider with thick hairy legs and a smoldering carapace encrusted with gems (some kind of fire-crab/acromantula hybrid)! Obviously that's the creature for him! If it grows bigger, he could even ride it around! And if it spins webs, he could totally have a hammock to sleep in with just a little effort wherever he went! Perfect for if he has to go back to living on the streets. He bonds with Hagrid over the monster, but careful wording denies running away from the Dursleys, and that it was Dumbledore who placed him there to start with. Hagrid, while kind and gentle, is a clueless fount of information, the kind that might not should be given to someone as cunning and wary as Harry.

He'd be sorted to Hufflepuff, no question. Loyal like a bear trap, and if anyone knows the value of hard work, its somebody that for half a decade had little more than the clothes on his back and the sweat on his brow to his name. He'd ditch History of Magic, spending hours in the library researching how to make a broom. He'd do the same for DADA, not being oblivious to the pain in his scar coming from Quirrelmort's presence.

Snape would be held in check by Sprout, mama-bear to all her little 'Puffs. He would still hate Harry with a passion, exacerbated by Harry's deliberate sabotage of his own potions and the explosions and mishaps they create, as well as Harry's complete lack of respect for rules or authority.

Harry would ditch the Halloween feast, on the grounds of avoiding a celebration of his parent's murders and the failure of his own. He'd bump into Hermione and the troll, and after a brief scuffle involving the 3rd floor Cerberus being released, Quirrelmort and Snape would get into an enormous 4 way fight causing destruction and student casualties as they blasted their way from the 3rd floor through the great hall, and out onto the grounds. Dumbledore catches up to them from behind, dozens of Aurors form up at the gates, and Voldemort is revealed before most of the school and significant number of the DMLE. Quirrell dies, Voldemort flees in wraith form, everyone starts talking at once.

Dumbledore answers insufficiently to explain the situation, and is removed from the grounds, though returns days later as Headmaster. Hermione follows Harry around like a house-elf, who proceeds to blow her mind and destroy her faith in Authority with an explanation of his childhood and the few brutal facts he knows about Halloween. "I was left on a doorstep like rubbish on November 1st, 1981, Hermione (yeah, the 1st makes Dumbledore a bit nastier). Hours after my parents were murdered, I was kidnapped and abandoned by Dumbledore, and I spent 10 years in a cupboard under the stairs and abused regularly, only to be introduced to magic by a man who was absolutely loyal to Dumbledore, and spouted the most propagandist pro-Gryffindor bullshit I've had the misfortune of hearing, short of that Weasley cretin. This fanatically loyal Dumbledore cultist who removes something from Gringott's bank on Dumbledore's behest hours before the bank is broken into. So Dumbledore brings this rare and powerful magical artifact here to Hogwarts, guards it with a cerberus and who-knows-what-else, and you know what happens? A dozen students DIED when Voldemort, who was possessing the DADA teacher, went on a RAMPAGE THROUGH THE SCHOOL, Hermione! He was here for two whole months and leaves corpses in his wake, and days later Dumbledore is back in charge and its like nothing ever happened. No questions, no answers, just life as normal."

Malfoy, emboldened by the presence of the Dark Lord, spouts his racist drivel in public for a couple days, until he is found one morning in the great hall, legs broken and face stuck with non-magical glue to the belly of Mrs. Norris.

Harry aces the tests of subjects he studied, doesn't even attend the ones he didn't, and takes the train back to London in June with an invisibility cloak, a pocketful of gold coins, and a hand-made broom that performs just as well as the Comet that Cedric Diggory rides, who Harry had learned quidditch and Beating from after his brilliant performance in flying class. Harry loves flying, and Harry loves hitting things with sticks, and aspirations of joining the Hufflepuff team in his second year fill his mind with plans for the summer.

His first spell causes the arrival of an owl with a warning, which Harry replies to with a simple- 'You have sent me this in error. I am Harry Potter.' Further spellcasting, owl messages, and spellhappy Aurors investigating starts a comedy of errors that somehow ends weeks later with Harry meeting simultaneously with the Queen and the Head of the DMLE ('Oh, you're Susan's Auntie! How's her summer going?' 'Nowhere near as exciting as your, Mr. Potter. I have heard a lot about you, and I have no idea how much of it is true and how much of it is a complete fabrication.'). Harry returns to Hogwarts for second year, Lucious Malfoy gives the T.M.Riddle diary to Ginny as per canon, and Harry's project this year, in addition to his duties on the quidditch team, is investigating ritual magic, and the magic of Hedweb, his Fire Acrabmantula. Hedweb is uncomfortable, sensing the Basilisk as its mortal foe. The year culminates in Harry killing the basilisk, and using its death as well as the chunk of soul from the Diary to empower Harry's Familiar connection, and completely trash all comprehension of Animagery when Harry recieves a fantastical monstrous form. Nearly a dozen meter long basilisk body, as wide around as a cow and held up off the ground by pairs of legs every meter and a half. Entirely engulfed in hints of flame, and eyes of burning rubies encircling the fanged head. Venom as potent as a basilisk's, capable of spinning fire-resistant webbing, a glare he could petrify or kill with, and nearly impervious to magic, Harry is now unstoppable.

** In an AU where Voldemort doesn't know the prophecy and Harry is one of his inner circle Death Eaters. Since Voldemort never tried to murder Harry as a kid, he doesn't resemble a snake with no nose, but more like his Tom Riddle self. The Marauders also never betrayed each other. This Harry is a fundamentally angry and power-hungry person who has effectively been brain-washed by Voldemort.

Anyway so he gets plagued by these nightmares, and sees an alternate Harry that he could have been (he doesn't know that, he thinks its just dreams). The start coming more often, and in more detail, and he finds out that Voldemort isn't the perfect wizard that he is making himself out to be. After slow character development, he becomes guilty of his actions and feels remorse (this doesn't happen for a while though, because it would be weird if you changed overnight because of dreamzz) and starts planning to lead a coup against Voldemort.

I also want to know about reluctant Muggleborns. Like, you have to think that some Muggleborns finish school and then decide to go back to their Muggle lives, right? I'm actually hoping to explore this idea in a fic that I have to have the time to write, where Hugo is a piano prodigy as a child, so he is very much immersed in the Muggle world growing up because the culture exists for his talent.

**** Having read your pieces series, and as a pianist myself, I would love a more expanded story for Hugo.

Love your work, by the way.

***** Wow, small world! And thank you! :) Hugo /will/ get an expanded story, I just can't promise when. Although, if JKR is going to insist on releasing Next Gen houses and info that completely screw up my universe, I now have the incentive to finish all the planned Pieces stories in the next two years, so I guess there's that! :)

** Something like [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?p=226414][this.]]

Well, not quite. For one, I think Rin's view of the situation is rather shallow and biased.

The part where she wants to use Azkaban as Auschwitz for muggleborns particularly shines of disinformation. If you were to make Nazi Wizards, you would be doing it very wrongly if you used pureblood supremacy and muggleborn discrimination.

The very cause of nazism was that the german people was placed above all else. Wizarding nazis would save their misplaced youth from the muggles.

If you want to make it grim and show how evil they are, feel free to oppress the muggles. As a matter of fact, this is why I really want to see such a story - real life nazis backed up their claims mostly with pseudo-science, as real life races have very small differences and most issues are cultural, but in a HP setting?

As far as we've seen, wizards live longer, are more intelligent, they have far more vitality, and, of course, magic.

If someone were to write this, and they better because I'd read the shit out of it, they'd have to handle how to actually do "untermensch." Because in this setting, it isn't actually just propaganda; the muggles are inferior to wizards, their wars ruin the world (and kill innocent wizards?), and their lifestyle is ruining the planet.

Other than that, I'd really enjoy to read some good Grindelwald fics, and some realistic war ones.

Bonus points if it turns out Grindelwald's organization is the wizard precursor to nazism and that he puppeteered WWII. If you somehow make a plausible scenario where Harry is an underling, I'll love you forever.

** I rarely see good, completed Harry/Ginny crossovers. I know there's really popular universes to throw Harry into but it's usually so Harry can hook up with a character from that universe. I'd also like to see some universes that Harry isn't often crossed over with.

Right now I'm playing Mass Effect and I started thinking of a world where, in 2160, a 5 year old Harry is abandoned at an orphanage after the Dursley's are killed in an accident. The orphanage is suffering from over population so Harry is shipped off to an orphanage on one of Earth's new colony worlds. The magical world has isolated itself greatly over the past 150 years and doesn't realize the recent explosion in technological advance by humanity. (In the ME universe humanity found the Mass Effect relays in 2149 which allowed them almost instantaneous travel across the galaxy and the ability to colonize other star systems.) It turns out that magic does have a range and when Harry leaves the Sol system all of the devices Dumbledore used to track him fail and Dumbledore mistakenly believes that Harry died along with the Dursley's.

23 years later Harry, now renamed Harry Shepard after no birth certificate for him is found, returns to Earth in preparation for his new mission as a Commander in the Alliance (Earth's space military). When Harry returns several devices in Dumbledore's office that haven't been active for 23 years suddenly reactivate. Voldemort has recently returned, not having Harry to use in the ceremony delayed his rebirth and Peter remained hidden as Scabbers for several more years. Harry's next mission is on board the new Alliance frigate the Normandy. Unfortunately the Normandy isn't finished yet and will be in dry dock for another three months, so Harry is given leave to wander Vancouver when his duties for the day are done. While getting to know some of his new crew members (Kaiden and Jenkins for those who played the games) Harry is grabbed by some members of the Order of the Phoenix.

From this point on the story would follow Harry as he goes through the main story of Mass Effect but focus more on the wizarding world being exposed to an extremely advanced muggle world. Harry wouldn't be able to simply give up his posting in the Alliance and in the grand scheme of things Voldemort seems more like a problem for local law enforcement. The wizarding world wouldn't comprehend space travel at first so when Harry says he has a mission to the colonies British Wizards would assume he meant actual former colonies of England.

Harry ends up going back to the Alliance only Ginny is sent with him as a liaison between the magical and muggle world. I rationalized this by saying Hermione had been killed by Voldemort or just wasn't in the picture for some reason. This is where the story stalls for me since I wouldn't want to simply do a retelling of Mass Effect with Harry as Shepard. I would want the introduction of the magical world to change the way the game plays out, like Ginny using apparition to rescue the crew-mate left on Virmire at the last minute, the hilarity of Ginny meeting an alien for the first time, Ginny teaching Harry the basics of magic while Liara and Kaiden comment on how many laws of physics they're breaking. Eventually the Order of the Phoenix working with Admiral Anderson to resist the Reaper invasion of Earth.

It's an idea I'm trying to piece together but those are the kind of stories I'd like to see more of.

** I want a story where Lavender survives the attack from Greybeck and Bill Weasley becomes instrumental in her recovery. Not as some weird romance, but as a really solid friendship/mentorship that grows out of the fact that he has gone through /exactly/ the same thing and still lives a fulfilling life and has someone who loves him without condition and thinks him handsome. I feel like there is so much potential in this that's already in place in the story, but no one has written it!
