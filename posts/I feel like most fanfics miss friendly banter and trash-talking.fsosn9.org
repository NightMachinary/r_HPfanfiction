It is a very entertaining pastime to just trash talk your friends, see who can deliver the sickest burn or the most creative ribbing. It is also something you see quite often in media, with the Top Gear/Grand Tour cast being a prime example of how this can be done right and convey a strong sense of comradery even if you constantly take the piss out of each other. Yet that is something you rarely see in fanfics.

I guess part of the reason is that neither Ron nor Hermione come across as people who would appreciate banter. Canon Ron is too insecure and not at all using self-deprecating humour. Hermione just seems an unlikely candidate to deliver those lines. But even in fics with other characters (even OCs), that's a branch of humour you rarely see. Harry has a sarcastic streak in canon, and even that does not make it into most fics.

And that's something I find regrettable because it can be a highly entertaing thing to witness, be it IRL or in media.


** I think the main reason for this is pretty simple: good banter is hard to do right. It has to come off as in-character, be mostly original, and mesh with the atmosphere. That goes double with relatively serious fics, where it can be hard to set up scenes appropriate for that sort of humour.

When you think about how many authors struggle with dialogue in the first place, it becomes a little more clear why there's so little good banter. My advice would be to look for authors who write well developed dialogue; there's a decent chance you'll find what you're looking for along with it.

** Harry is sarcastic, but rarely so towards his friends. His sarcasm usually comes out as a result of anger or irritation, but rarely when he's in a good mood.

Ron can certainly throw some shots, like the example below.

#+begin_quote
  /“I've got two neptunes here,“ said Harry after a while, frowning down at his piece of parchment, “that can't be right, can it?”/

  “Aaaaah,” said Ron, imitating Professor Trelawney's mystical whisper, “when two neptunes appear in the sky, it is a sure sign that a midget in glasses is being born, Harry...” (*Book 4, Ch.13 "Mad-Eye Moody")
#+end_quote

But, he's a few years out from being able to take shots in stride.

But it is because of this, that I think that a Post-Hogwarts Harry and Ron would be great for this. Once the awkwardness of puberty is over, I can definitely see them doing this.

** I agree with you, although I fear I'll be unable to write friendly banter because my protagonists come from a too high and posh background. Most fanfics seem to focus more on the plot and being serious and every word uttered by the characters serving as advancing the plot or are mandatory pleasantries.

*** There are quite a few military movies where the characters are bantering while in the trenches or under fire. Gallow humour can certainly fit such a situation, or baseless boasting and then calling that out.

Also, I disagree with the idea that such scenes do not advance the plot or otherwise contribute little. It is a great tool to show character dynamics, to show their friendship or even as a background thing in other scenes.

*** High and posh characters don't preclude banter - they just modify it. Socially "higher classes" engage in sniping and trash-talking of their own, they just use a lot more subtext and implication to avoid any /overt/ giving of offence. That could be incredibly fun to write - but challenging to pull off as well!

** To quote Prisoner of Azkaban; /Ron, who told Hermione she was a know-it-all at least twice a week, said loudly, ‘You asked us a question us a question and she knows the answer! Why ask if you don't want to be told?'/

I think that infers that the trio banter (or at least Ron and Hermione do) at least a bit. And then there's the common non-serious arguments between Ron and Hermione, they're probably a lot like the arguments between the Top Gear/Grand Tour crew, and then Harry randomly chimes in with a sarcastic quip.

***** In the first four books, they constantly are trying to hurt each other verbally. What Ron says during the Yule Ball, or more accurately what he implies (Hermione is either a naive bimbo or a traitor after Hermione had been the only one who really stood with Harry) would be a friendship ending moment IRL. And in year 3, the gloves were off completely.

If anything, those books show that Ron is unable to take a good ribbing is stride, nor does he attempt to during the whole pet fighting business.

******* Ron's unsanctioned pet was on the food list of two of the sanctioned pets. It is probably only to the fact that it was in fact not a rat that it survived two years at Hogwarts.

He refused to properly secure his pet (eg a cage), he did not even possess any kind of carrier (like Hedwig's cage or whatever Hermione used). Worst case he could have simply asked his family or McG to transfigure one, yet he never does. That shows how much he cared about that rat. Therefore he has no right to complain at the natural behaviour of Hermione's pet.

Unsanctioned? IIRC, it was Percy's pet rat first. If McG allowed it when Percy started Hogwarts, why should it be banned just because Hermione brought her cat? The cat that kept coming into the boy's dorm, for that matter. Ron's pet takes precedence.

Cats eat rats, fine. Then why was Hermione crying over the accusation that her cat ate the rat? Crookshanks had been going after Ron and Scabbers for months and she pulls the "Cats eat rats" card as a reason not to do anything to control her pet, but when Scabbers finally disappears its, "Why are you blaming Crookshanks for eating your rat? He didn't do it!" You gotta pick one.

No mention of rats. Therefore they are not allowed. As for why McG never said anything to Percy, well, most likely she did not notice. Or maybe she had pity with the Weasleys. In which case it would be like a police officer looking the other way when someone is smoking a joint.

Didn't notice? For FOUR years? Okay if you say so. And pity? Lee had a tarantula during Harry's first year. They have poisonous fangs. Did McGonagall 'pity' Lee as well?

So Hermione is free from responsibility because she's overworked. Right. Okay 🙄. Had she controlled Crookshanks better or at least admitted "Okay, fine, maybe my cat ate your rat, I'm sorry", after saying "Cats eat rats", then maybe Ron's reaction would be uncalled for. But after failing to control her pet AND not taking responsibility (remember, Scabbers was found dead in the BOYS' DORM, not the common room, not the corridors, not the classrooms, in the BOYS' DORM)...yeah Ron's anger was justified. No two ways about it.

** Agree with the comments that it's largely because of the skill required to write good "banter". It also depends on the plot and tone of the story, and how else the characters are developed.

Yes, Harry has a sarcastic streak, but too many writers then try to make that his entire (re-)characterisation, and it just makes him come across as insufferable.

I'm sure the writers fill in the characters more in their minds than they do in their stories, but when every piece of dialogue is either functional (driving the plot) or sarcastic (reinforcing that one aspect of the character), then it just makes the character lifeless.

I think with this aspect of character crafting, like with all things, it is about balance. This is where the world-building and inconsequential "scenes" come into play. A good writer will use the dialogue to show us something that a less skilled writer might tell us through the narrative.

Part of the beauty of the books is that they incorporate so much world-building, these are the usually irrelevant snippets (and occasional Chekhov's guns) that make the world seem deep and rich in history and detail. That matters every bit as much as driving the plot and getting to the next bit of "action".
