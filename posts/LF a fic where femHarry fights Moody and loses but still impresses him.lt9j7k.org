:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
As the title says, looking for a fic where a fem!Harry (pretty sure it's a female Harry, but I admit I'm not 100% on that) fights Moody - the real one, not Barty Crouch Jr. She gets her arse kicked, appropriately so, but does manage to pull some cunning tricks and gets in a few hits that Moody appreciates. He has a very "Good work, lass. A few more years and you'll be head and shoulders above most others." type response to her afterward.

I know it's definitely on FFNet or Ao3 (I don't read on anything else), but I remember basically nothing else about this fic. Not length, not pairing, not nothing. Just the one scene I mentioned above.

Apparently it happened in 'Adrift in a World' but I checked it over and I'm pretty sure that's not the fic I'm thinking of.

*** Except Moody is just a generic hardarse as opposed to sexist.

  Harry Potter is thrown into an alternate universe due to archaic rules of magic. Hiding under the alias of Chris Collins, he tries to find a place among the suspicion of those he knew and some he never did, as Voldemort's power grows.
