Found this today browsing the new lists. Looking pretty decent to me. It's called 'The Griffin Association'.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10830024/1/The-Griffon-Association]]

New at the minute, but the author already updated it twice today, so...


** Nice, didn't expect to see my work suggested for a long time.

*** Chapters are way too short. If you're updating twice a day, you might as well combine them.

**** I did think it was quite short. I have a lot of free time on my hands, so I wouldn't be adverse to spending a lot more time on the individual chapters.

How much of a word count would you like for each chapter? I was thinking maybe 5-10k, as I think anything above that may be above my ability to detail. Never been very good with the detail.

***** I mean you have artistic license as the author, but 5-10k sounds perfectly fine. Interesting story. I'll probably let it pile up until there's some meat to it and marathon it, but keep up the good work!

** I don't like the immoral, apolitical, only-guided-by-money henchmen/mercenary/assassin archetype. It's too cliche because either they don't grow as a character at all, or they grow towards the good, law abiding side. It's pretty much guaranteed, and the fact that it's overdone in professional fiction makes me not want to read it in an amateur fic. That's not to say that this isn't a good story, because it looks well written, but I just can't enjoy reading it.

*** That's good then, considering this isn't that. Just give Chapter 3 a chance (when I release it, maybe in a day or so?) before you write it off as an assassin fic.

**** I guess it is a bit early, but I'm not sure there's much you can do to further interest me personally in the story given that the introduction was less than appealing to me.
