  Tom Riddle pointed with his wand on the poor shivering victim.

  “Avada Kedavra!”

  His wand turned into unhappy clucking chicken.

  Twin brothers laughed in the background.

** Voldemort stared at his wand, bemusement giving way to anger. The Death Eaters shuffled awkwardly in the background, unsure of whether they should help their master or pretend this wasn't happening.

"Damn you! Work! I am the wizard, so I command you do as I say!" Voldemort screamed at his wand.

And as though that were the impetus for the wand to finally act, the wand stiffened in his hand, emitted a loud /quack/ and immediately transformed into a large rubber duck.

In the back of Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes, George Weasley suddenly looked up, as though hearing an unseen whisperer, and grinned to himself.

** It's my headcanon that that's what Dumbledore intended for Voldemort in the first place: using Harry's sacrifice to strip him of any power to harm others. It's consistent with Dumbledore's philosophy that there are worse things you can do to a man than killing him and Harry's threats that he won't be hurting anyone anymore, as well as the revelation that Dumbledore's original plan was for him to die undefeated (thus making the elder wand useless). Imagine Voldemort's frustration when after all the knowledge and power he acquired, he cannot use it to harm anyone. Imagine his humiliation as he is being paraded through the streets as people spit and throw rocks at him. I don't recall which Ottoman sultan had a similar fate and when he saw how much the people truly hated him, he died of a bad heart.

Edit: the sultan in question was Bayzed I and was imprisoned and humiliated in that way by Tamerlane.

** Voldemort stands there in shock, looking at his wand with utter confusion painted on his face. "/Avada Kedavra/," he says again, but less confidently than before, and still the wand does nothing.

Harry is of course relieved that he hasn't been killed, but he has a look of confusion on his face as well. Bellatrix steps up to Voldemort. "Sir...is there something wrong?" she asks.

"I...I'm sorry. This has never happened before," Voldemort mutters, still astonished.

Now that Harry understands the problem, he smiles and lets out a laugh. "Professor Dumbledore told me this might happen," he says. "Sometimes at a certain age, wizards have a hard time 'readying their wands,' so to speak." Harry continues to laugh, which makes Voldemort angrier.

"/Avada Kedavra!/" he cries again, but still nothing comes out of his wand. Harry starts laughing even harder now.

"This kind of thing happens to Muggles, too," Harry says. "My uncle had to start taking little blue pills to deal with the situation with his 'wand,' so to speak. I can recommend his doctor to you if you'd like." Harry doubles over and laughs even harder. Even Bellatrix lets out some giggles in spite of herself. Voldemort glares at her, and she stifles her laugh.

"Sir, perhaps I could kill the boy in your stead," she says.

"You know that won't work!" Voldemort cries. "The prophecy demands that I be the one to kill him. Do you understand how dangerous it would be if the prophecy were not to be fulfilled? Unspeakable consequences may occur! The very fabric of space and time could be destroyed!"

"Actually," Harry says, straightening up now, "there is still a way for the prophecy to be fulfilled. /Avada Kedavra!/"

A green light flashes, and Voldemort keels over dead. Bellatrix screams and drapes herself over his lifeless corpse.

"I guess my wand can still perform without trouble," Harry says. He walks away with a swagger in his step, fully confident and comfortable in his own abilities. He figures now would be as good a time as any to find Ginny.

** Took a stab at this prompt, haven't really tried doing it before, so I don't know if I did a good job or not.

"Stand aside, you silly girl... stand aside now...", Voldemort hissed to a horrorstruck Lily Potter. Yet, she refused to move. Frustrated, he pointed his wand towards her, and uttered the fatal words, "Avada Kedavra!".

Nothing happened.

Had Voldemort thought for a moment, he may have remembered that he accidentally infused more magic into his promise to one Severus Snape than he intended to. Unfortunately for him, he didn't, and Magic demanded a price for the violated promise.

Voldemort looked at his wand in disbelief, and slashed it towards her, repeating the Killing Curse once again, but was no more successful than the last time. Meanwhile, Lily, who stared at him in stunned silence, unable to believe her luck, or to understand why he seemed unable to kill her, quickly regained her composure. She hadn't defied Voldemort thrice with James by being his housewife, and could very much hold her own if it was necessary, even if she preferred more passive Order tasks in the interest of giving Harry a more stable environment. She gave a brief thought to why Voldemort's magic didn't seem to work -- maybe /he/ had actually managed to do the right thing in his life in the end, if there was anything to Dumbledore and his weird crytic remarks about their supposed spy -- but dismissed it as irrelevant for now, and quickly summoned her wand.

Voldemort, seeing his luck run out, decided to make a run for it. Unfortunately, without magic, he wasn't very successful. And soon got to learn that a vindicative mother whose husband just died and whose child had been threatened to death, was perfectly able to show him what it felt like to experience the role of the Muggle in one of his Muggle raids.

** This could be used for an interesting interpretation of the scarcrux, perhaps Harry realizes that Voldemort is making him angry through the scar and it occurs to Harry that he can muddle Voldemort's emotions enough that he's incapable of casting spells with an emotional requirement like the Unforgivables. Of course Voldemort could then do the same and prevent Harry from using spells like the Patronus Charm, but that just places them both on the same level of using hogwarts student-level spells that don't require much emotional input, thus marking them as equals and allowing Harry to win a duel against Voldemort who is significantly more experienced in more obscure dark arts that require strong emotions to work.

** The AK spell doesn't check if you /think/ you want the target you /think/ you're aiming at dead. It checks if you /actually/ want the target who's /really/ there dead. Trying to AK someone is a standard test among dark wizards for polyjuice, deception, illusions, and unknown information. Is he trying to target Harry and actually aiming at the horcrux? Is the intended victim a polyjuiced and imperius'd loyal Death Eater? That's yet to be determined. But what we know is that if Voldie understood the situation perfectly, he wouldn't want the spell to succeed. So it doesn't. Intent-based spells are well-behaved like that.

**** 1) I know this isn't canon. That's why I posted on the fanfic subreddit. 2) if it were like this in canon, you're wrong about what would happen in that scene. I didn't say anything about giving the killing curse extra ability to route around obstacles, just better choices about whether or not to successfully cast. What would actually happen is that the spell would notice that it's not aimed at Harry, it's aimed at its own caster's final horcrux, and would fail just as surely as if you tried to cast it at your best friend

***** This sparks the question whether Voldemort would've been able to make Harry a Horcux to begin with - sure, he /thought/ he wanted to cast the spell at the toddler, but if he understood the situation perfectly, /would/ he have wanted it?

He would have to know the prophecy, and understand that to fullfil the prophecy, he would have to /mark/ his equal - thus, he wouldn't want to mark anyone his equal, in order not to /have/ someone to vanquish him.

And would he have been able to kill Lily? She was the one who doomed him with her death the first time - and if Voldemort understood the sacrificial magic going on, he wouldn't have wanted to activate it - it's what made him a bodiless spirit for over a decade!

Would he have even been able to make horcruxes? Or would he find himself unable, and dive into research to Perfect the technique to have his killing curse work?

Maybe he would've been able to make the first thanks to his basilisk, but then recoil in horror when he discovered trying to kill for Horcux always failed, regret it and start over with his research of Immortality.

Maybe, he would've become a far more terrifying Dark Lord - with all the charm and patience of Tom Riddle, and all the cruelty, power and pseudo-immortality of Lord Voldemort - if not true, irrevocable Immortality to help him terrorize the wizarding world forever.

And where would young Harry come in in such a world?

Would he have still somehow wound up with a sliver of Voldemort's Soul? If so, how?

Would he have thought it appropriate to glorify Voldemort, alongside the rest of the world which never saw the war and never got to fight in it, for this world had long since been claimed by the Dark Lord?

Or would they have fought vehemently, and Harry with them?

If he became a True Immortal and still somehow marked Harry his equal, would Harry be thrown into sudden Immortality? What would the prophecy of the world be?

And if Harry did become immortal, how would he deal with the idea of losing his friends and family? Would he become dark, calculating and selfish, willing to force them into the abyss of sempiternity with him? Or would he try to distance himself from them in order not to be as hurt?

To summarize, I /really/ want to see your comment's prompt come to life and explore all the possibilities.

** Unknown to Voldemort he was standing inside of a ward that Harry had him maneuvered into. It was a special ward that Hermione had set up in advance, knowing that Voldemort would want to make Harry's defeat as public as possible. It was a variation of a Time Out Ward that she had read about in an old copy of Witch's Weekly.

In short, he was being treated as no more than a misbehaving child right before Harry finished him for good.

And then they all lived happily ever after, after fixing the glaring social issues that allowed Voldemort to rise in the first place. Insert non-canon pairings of choice, because can anyone really imagine Ronmione working out for real?
