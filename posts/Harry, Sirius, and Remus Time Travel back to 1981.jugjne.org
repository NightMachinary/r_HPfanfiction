I just started a fic on ao3 where Harry, Sirius, and Remus all fall through the veil and it takes them back to June 30, 1981 into their bodies that they had back then. Sadly, it only has two chapters and not much happens, but I love the idea and was wondering if anyone knows of any fics that are of a similar concept? They can be either complete or incomplete, I just want more of this idea.

Here is the link to the fic I read in case anyone is interested: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11271345/chapters/25205646#workskin]]
