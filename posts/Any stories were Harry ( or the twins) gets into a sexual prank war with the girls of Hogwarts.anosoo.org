By sexual prank I mean stuff like vanishing each other's underwear (or transfiguraing it into something embarrassing like a thong of chastity belt). With the prank war being a secret between the girls and Harry.


** Wouldn't that be sexual harassment?

*** In real life? Hells yes. In fanfic? Not if the writer writes them as okay with it. Depends on the author really.

*** Depend what the Author wants it to be.

I also don't really see harry being the instigator of the prank war if its him. I also don't see him "winning" the prank war considering he would be against all the Girl in Hogwarts and maybe the Beauxbaton girls if it happens in Fourth year.

***** That is why I put Winning in Quotation marks.

and there is a lot worse stuff in fanfiction so why is this the hill you seem to want to take a stand on?

Edit: and who said anything about comedy or it being played for laughs?

******* Its cool.

​

Edit:I was more think of something were a Group of girls do an underwear raid on Harry and then Harry uses accio to get it back but the people who see harry cast accio only see harry stealing girls underwear(If some of the girls were wearing harry underwear that they stole) and then the group of girls not in the know think that harry is the Villain and start targeting him, harry fight back but there are a lot more girls them him. Harry gets crushed by the girls and then eventually it comes out that the girls actually started it leading to the girls that have been Ganging up on Harry having to apologise and then I dont know were it would go form them.

​

but that's just what i would do if i could write

******** I was thinking more like the "Much Ado About Nothing" way, where the main characters are pranked into hooking up by their friends. But possibly with more smut.

*** I mean it could be, but that's easy enough to avoid by everyone agreeing to ground rules. Same sort of situation as waking someone up via foreplay. Normally assault, totally cool and great if everyone has agreed to participate
