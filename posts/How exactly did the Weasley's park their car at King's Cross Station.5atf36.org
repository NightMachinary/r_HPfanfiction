I assume they wouldn't have had muggle money to pay for a space in a nearby lot. I guess they could have just left it nearby and used magic to make it not get towed. Or are there free 30 min parking spaces at the station or something like that?

** The book says they parked down a side street. It seems unlikely that they could get free street side parking that close to a major train station but they probably just didn't bother paying for a ticket. I expect the possibility of a parking fine didn't even occur to them, nor any other parking laws especially as they were in a hurry.

** LOL this is by far one of the most amusing questions I have read on here. Its just such a minor and odd part of the HP universe to wonder about. I love it.

My theory is simply that because its a train/travel station, there are free limited time parking spaces in the area. This is true at least over in the US at many such stations. Either that or they simply didnt care being wizards and will get a parking ticket.

However a more fun theory would be that there are parts of it we dont know but only Mr Weasley knows. Like, we know it flies and has an expanded inside... but maybe it can go invisible, or compress to fit in a tiny spot, or be shrunk down to be put in a pocket, or parked mid air, or who knows what.

**** Union Station in DC has free parking, although its technically a cell phone waiting area. But its still free and you can sit in it for 30 minutes and a good chunk of folks just leave their car there and walk over to the front of the station to help those they are picking up with the luggage. And thats downtown DC.
