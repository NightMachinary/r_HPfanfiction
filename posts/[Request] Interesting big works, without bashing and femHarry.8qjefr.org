*** Word of advice: do not stop reading at some point and come back later.

There is too much to remember and keep track of to come back months later. Seriously, the amount of OCs in here may actually outnumber the characters in canon (I haven't counted).

**** I second that! Under any circumstances do not stop reading it! I stopped reading it something after 4th year and only thing that remembers where I left is ff.net app on my tablet... If my tablet forgets I am screwed.

*** I just looked at that word count and actually said "holy fucking shit" out loud. Can you tell me anything about this fix is it really worth the ~125 or so hours to read it? Does it stay unique and fresh or turn in to a dragging on mess that repeats plot points like a marauders plan?

** I know it's not popular here but I think linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) fits that description, though it's very different from most fanfics

*** I've read it a long time ago.

Honestly, I don't know why it's so unpopular here. Nice piece of fanfiction, I say

(And every comment I've seen or written mentioning this fic gets downvoted. Seriously, HPfans? Why such ostracism?)
