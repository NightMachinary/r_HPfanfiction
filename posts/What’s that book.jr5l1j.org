:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There is this unofficial harry potter book someone told me about one time where Hermione was sorted into Ravenclaw, The Dursley's are like fancy people and I think Petunia might have even married someone else? Harry is also smart or something and Ron was possibly in hufflepuff? It also fixes all the plot holes I think. It's not a fanfic but I thought you guys might know what i'm talking about


** Is it HPMOR? Petunia did marry this person who likes reading books.

*** I would say that it causes more plot holes than it fills but hey I'm in the HPMOR is kinda trash camp
