So I'm looking for a marauders fanfic from atleast 5th year or below, and a canon one at that without time travel etc Also I would prefer it to be in James POV, not only centring around his relationship with lily but also his friends and the order I've read one called James potter chronicles in the past and it fits all the criteria's except the author suddenly stopped midway through 5th year Thanks
