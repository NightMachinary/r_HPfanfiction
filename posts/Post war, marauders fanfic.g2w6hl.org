HP fanfiction

Hey guys,

Back in the grind in reading HP fanfiction. Looking for

1) Stories that focuses on the events set after the second war.

Needs to focus on Harry and Ginny's relationship and Harry's escapades as an Auror. Needs to be raw emotional

2) Marauders time

3) Time travel where lily James Sirius (from the past) etc. meet Harry

I really want mature stories. Ones that genuinely exhibit a good flow of story. Ones that display emotion , rawness, action, the full package basically

Would really appreciate if someone could help me!

Please give me suggestions!

Thanks

#+begin_quote
  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)
