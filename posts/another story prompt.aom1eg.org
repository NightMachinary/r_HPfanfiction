so I just randomly had a dream and this is a result from that

the basic idea of this is harry as a skill thief, I've seen him as a natural legimens/occlumens, and ones where he copies the skills of others through those abilities, but it'd be rather amusing to see him beat old moldywart by using his link with him to I dunno, fully steal his skill with aiming, or maybe his ability to manually breathe (I'd imagine autonomic processes dont count, but I just had a scene in my mind where he takes the skill of breathing manually and then shouts something like "Hey, Tommy boy! dont stop breathing!" and of course, this makes him attempt to breathe manually, since his focus is on that, a couple minutes later, he passes out)
