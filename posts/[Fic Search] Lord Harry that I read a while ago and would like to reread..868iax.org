The part that stands out the most was Harry in the Triwiz about to start the first task but instead of being in the tent he was in the stands. Crouch tries to get him to compete but Harry replies that he can not because he is underage. Crouch then tries to change the contract but because of him changing the contract Harry was able to void it. Or it was that he got Crouch to emancipate him then claimed his Lordship and voided the contract. Could be either and I'm reading so much that I've confused one with another.

Edit: Never mind I've found it. If anyone was curious it was Angry Harry and the Seven

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.
