Looking for any fix where Harry becomes an emporer and or dictator


** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13165325/1/Echoes-in-the-Fog][Echoes in the Fog]] Evil!Harry is the 2nd in command to Voldemort himself, but since for most of the work Voldemort is away from England, Evil!Harry is in charge. In this fic, Canon!Harry, Grey!Harry and friends get pulled into Evil!Harry's dimension. Chaos ensues.

I'd recommend reading the prequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13108396/1/For-Lack-of-a-Bezoar][For Lack of a Bezoar]] before reading Echoes in the Fog. For Lack of a Bezoar is a quick 35k word story detailing how Grey!Harry becomes during his 6th and 7th years. Essentially Ron doesn't get saved with a Bezoar in 6th year and Harry and Hermione both become darker as a result. Both fics are really good reads.

I've also heard that Marquis Black's /Emperor/ has Harry Potter as an emperor, but I've never read it so I can't say whether it's good or not.

*** Emperor starts really strong, but starts to drag after the end of the Civil War arc. My main gripe with it is that Harry is ridiculously powerful - except when he's not so the plot can happen.

**** Thanks! I'll keep that in mind should I start it. The length of that fic intimidates me so I probably won't get to it for awhile though, lol.

*** For Lack of a Bezoar is somewhat satisfying to read. Echoes in the Fog is, in my opinion, straight up depressing.

**** I'll admit I was hoping for the appearance of the people in the other universe to force some kind of mass rebellion against Voldemort's rule. It didn't need to be 100% sucessful, but maybe if they could have liberated a few areas and cast doubt among the public about Voldemort's omnipotence. But I get that everybody was just looking for a way out of the situation because they were tired of fighting. Still though, IMO Echoes in the Fog is the fic with the best use of dimension hopping. It's not easy to take three different sets of characters and shove them all into the same world, so kudos to the author on that.

***** I agree, there was next to no payoff for the main cast after all they went through. The premise has a lot of potential and the author did lay a pretty strong foundation with the prequel, I just feel like the sequel could've been something more

** Here is a one-shot that might be what you are looking for.
