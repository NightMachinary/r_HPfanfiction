Harry Potter had thought Slytherin's NEVER got detention, yet here he was with one such grademate, cleaning trophies and awards. Tracy Davis had bemused him in the fact that she REFUSED to work in silence.

"So of course Parkinson is still in denial of the contract. So glad I get to avoid all that political marriage bull. How half-bloods and Muggleborns haven't started their own revolution I will never understand." she finished commenting as she polished McGonagall's 1943 quidditch cup.

For the first time of the night he responded with more than a 'yea' or a 'no'. "Because the rest of us don't see open rebellion as moral."

"Pah!" she snorted, "I'm no blood purist, but even I know the system we have needs to be pulled down. It's weak and both too centralized and not centralized enough."

"Voldemort is just a terrorist with a fancy title. He doesn't plan to rebuild, just rule. Attacking the Ministry isn't right." he said, spitting as he finished to give Tom Riddle's Award for special services a 'proper shine'.

Looking over her shoulder at him from the quidditch section on the other side of the hall, "You CAN'T tell me you think the current Ministry serves anyone or anything but itself?"

"Well... No." he replied.

"But you DON'T want to tear it down?" she confirmed.

Once again he replied, "No, it would hurt too many people."

"So what you are saying... is that you want to go into politics and change it yourself?" Tracy declared, standing and staring at Harry from across the way.

For a brief moment he looked horrified, "Merlin NO!" and for a long moment she just stared at him, "What?"

"You Gryffindor's are so weird." she decided, "You want political change without taking the steps to ENACT it. Wont bribe, threaten, or blackmail the people who have the power, won't take up the power yourself, and wont seize the means by force... What DO you want to happen exactly?"

The rest of the detention was held in quiet contemplation...


** Well, JKR obviously has them eventually seizing the power by force, and a large part of the fandom doesn't like it:

"But why would Harry become a Wizard cop?"

"Harry would never work for the Ministry!"

**** I agree with both. They DID eventually seize control through violence, but it appears that nothing really changes, even with Kingsley in control. Though I think the Auror thing is more Harry wanting to protect others, NOT serve the Ministry. He see's it as the most moral and viable option IMHO.

******* I wrote this [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12925628/1/Interview-with-Director-Potter][one shot]], in which I laid out my expectations for the postwar Britain. In one moment, I have Harry talking about why he had to join the Ministry:

#+begin_quote
  HJP: It wasn't easy, but circumstances required my presence in the Ministry. It was in total shambles. It was disgraced beyond recognition after being overthrown twice within a period of ten months. The people were furious and outraged after hearing what happened to children at Hogwarts and to Muggleborns. Within a few days of the Battle, they were marching on the Ministry and Wizengamot, led by none other than Molly and Augusta Longbottom.

  HJP: Kingsley came to me and explained the situation. If the mob had stormed the Ministry, it would have completely collapsed. ICW might have assumed Britain would no longer be able to enforce the Statute of Secrecy, which would had led to an intervention. We - Kingsley, the DA, and the Order - would have been held responsible, and Voldemort remnants could have potentially returned to power. That was a situation we absolutely wanted to avoid. So I called up the DA and used the emergency Floo at Hogwarts to arrive in the Minister's Office. We openly appealed to the crowd and eventually worked out an agreement.
#+end_quote

--------------

Then I wrote another scene where they vented their frustrations at the Ministry:

#+begin_quote
  [Ministry of Magic, August 27, 1998]

  Seamus: We can't do this? We can't do that?! What was that soulless motherfucker thinking? He thought he could hide behind that foul “I'm just following order, we have to follow procedures” excuse? You know what, if any of those Death Eaters got away because of that motherfucker and more innocents are harmed, I'm going to personally tear that motherfucker from limb to limb!

  Neville: Language, Seamus, Language.

  Seamus: Sorry, Neville. I shall rephrase it to “inbred soulless motherfucking Ministry minion”! It's not just that little piece of shit, there are a whole bunch of those inbred soulless motherfucking Ministry minions who still think they own this damn place. We fought, we bled, we suffered, and we died, and those shit think they can still order us around? It's about time we teach them a lesson!

  Ron (laughs out loud): That was bloody brilliant, Seamus. That felt so good! Sorry, Neville, I hope you take no offense?

  Neville: None at all, I and Seamus went all the way to hell and back. We understand each other perfectly well, although I certainly wouldn't express myself that way in front of Kingsley. But Seamus has a point, there are still too many from the old Ministry, with their arrogant and corrupt attitudes. Kingsley might have cleaned out the Auror office, but it's only a part of the DMLE. We need to change that, and soon.

  Harry: Which means more politics. I hate that. I thought we had it after the Wizengamot was purged, thanks to your gran and Molly of course. But the rot in the Ministry goes far deeper than my worst imagination. They weren't just forced into serving Voldemort. They did it willingly!

  Dean: We can't be too reckless though, or else we might face a full-fledged rebellion.

  Seamus: I say bring them on, lure them into the open, and then we will deal with them like we did with the Carrows...

  Neville: Seamus!

  Seamus: Oh, sorry Neville. I'm really really sorry this time.

  Harry: What did you do with the Carrows?

  Ron and Dean both turn their attention on Neville and Seamus.

  Neville: I think this will sooner or later come out. Seamus, do you agree that we should tell them the truth?

  Seamus nodded.

  Neville: Good. After you three went to sleep, we remembered that the Carrows were still tied up in the Ravenclaw Tower. So I led scores of DA members and we tortured them into pieces of vegetables. Then we killed them and explained that they were killed trying to escape. I'm not proud of this action, but I have no regrets. For what they did to hundreds of my fellow students, they totally deserved it.

  Ron: Bloody Hell!

  Seamus: Neville, it's not only you! We all agreed, especially Ginny...

  Neville: Seamus, what Ginny did is not our right to tell. Harry can ask her directly.

  Dean: Why didn't you call me to join the party?

  Neville: You were asleep as well, and Luna said not to get you involved.

  Dean: Luna was part too? Why did she leave me out? I have every reason to get back at them!

  Neville: You have to ask her, Dean. Luna cares very much about you, and she certainly had her reasons.

  Ron: You have my support too. Those two totally deserved it. I'm glad Ginny had her revenge. It's a pity Mum got Bellatrix too quickly. Harry?

  Harry: I certainly can't blame you, since I crucioed Amycus Carrow for spitting on Professor McGonagall.

  Others: You did what?

  Ron: Wow, I never knew you had that in you, Harry! You got Cruciatus to work on your first try?

  Harry: No, that was my second attempt. I first tried to cast it on Bellatrix in the Department of Mysteries, after she had murdered Sirius. It didn't work, and she taunted me by saying that “I have to mean it!”.

  Harry: Now that I remember it, Ginny did feel somewhat off when I met her in the common room after waking up. Does anyone else know?

  Neville: Professor McGonagall knows. Although she disagrees, she understands us.

  Harry: We will need a full pardon on all of our actions against Death Eaters during the War, and we will need significant freedom of actions against them in the future.

  Ron: Does that mean you want us to use Unforgivables?

  Harry: Maybe not Unforgivables, but lethal force for sure. During the Final Battle, they were throwing every dark curse at us, while we mostly answered with Stunners. A simple Rennervate by their fellow murderers meant they were back in business. It was criminal. We would have lost far fewer if we had fought back more effectively.

  Harry: Remember, we had Doholov and Rowle down in that Cafe, and we let them go. God knows how many more Muggleborns, Muggles, and Hogwarts students they had murdered afterwards. Remus was killed by Doholov, and it was my misplaced mercy that Teddy lost both of his parents. I should have listened to you then, and killed them on the spot.

  Ron: No Harry, you can't blame yourself for that! Dolohov murdered them, not you! Besides, Voldemort had my whole family as hostages, and if we had killed them, he might have retaliated by killing my family!

  Harry: Maybe. Maybe it was the right decision on that night, for us. But then during the Final Battle, we also had Greyback down after he mauled Lavender. Why didn't we put him permanently out of business there? Why?

  Neville: Because we were students then, not trained killers. They failed us, so we had to step up to do the dirty work. The Ministry, the whole lot of them, they all failed us.

  Seamus: Damn right, Neville! So what are we going to do about those inbred soulless motherfucking Ministry minions?
#+end_quote

[Later]

#+begin_quote
  Harry: Ginny, can I ask you something?

  (Cast a privacy spell)

  Ginny: What?!

  Harry: Today in the Ministry, when we were talking, something came up. It had to do with what happened to the Carrows...

  Ginny: They spilled it? We all agreed to keep it a secret! Who did it? I'm going to hex their bits off!

  Harry: Please Ginny, hear me out before you do something rash.

  Ginny (trying to calm down): Spit it out then!

  Harry: It happened when we were venting about certain people in the Ministry, and Seamus let it slip. Neville thought it was best to come clean with us, me and Ron I mean. They didn't talk about what you did. Neville said that if I want to know, I should ask you directly. Please, I'm not trying to lecture you or anything, because I also crucioed Amycus Carrow for spitting on Professor McGonagall before the Battle.

  Ginny: You really did that to Amycus Carrow, or are you just trying to make me feel better?

  Harry: Ginny, I've never lied to you. If you don't want to talk about it, it's fine. I just want to let you know that the Carrows totally deserved it for hurting you and other students.

  Ginny: After you three left the Great Hall, our mood became subdued soon. Luna suddenly mentioned that the Carrows had to be still in the Ravenclaw Tower, and we should not let them escape. It was I who suggested to get back at them for the pain and suffering they put us through. Eventually, more than three dozen joined.

  Ginny: We agreed to give everyone 15 seconds, and we would keep going as long as they were still responsive. I had a go at them at least three times, and I really enjoyed it. It felt so good to hurt them, to make them suffer. Harry, I'm not your innocent Quidditch girl anymore. I'm a monster as bad as Bellatrix Lestrange.

  Harry: No, Ginny, don't say that! You are not a monster. If you were, you would not have been feeling guilty about it. You merely avenged yourself and our classmates. Child torturers like them are the worst scums!

  Ginny: So you won't see me as some kind of monster?

  Harry: Never, even if you are a monster, I'm one too.

  Ginny: Oh Harry!

--- Friedrich Nietzsche

By throwing these kids to the wolves, by making them the frontline fighters against those sadistic genocidal magical Nazi scums, the establishment of Wizarding Britain has created a whole generation of hardened and ruthless child soldiers.

They won a brutal victory against overwhelming odds, after experiencing unimaginable hardships and suffering, so don't ever expect them to go easy on their enemies. Even the Wizard Jesus can only take so much, and he will crucio any enemy who spits on his friends. His friends will be even less forgiving.

******* Sorry, I don't want to be a ride, but I don't understand this mentality with them or against them. Is it so difficult to conceive that for a system to change, it must have decent people in the system? Or would you prefer that the entire system be completely demolished and start from scratch?

Furthermore, Harry doesn't "hate the system", he hates corrupt people. On the other hand, Mr. Weasley, Moody, Tonks and Dumbledore are part of the system and Harry has no problem with that.

***** I always assumed that it was at least partly because he didn't really have any idea what he wanted to do and so picked an option in 5th year and just ran with it, rather than some burning passion. Also it probably helped that many of the most capable order members, people he would have looked up to, were Aurors.

**** Well, he got to start somewhere.

According to JKR, he made it to Head Auror as early as 2007, and that's a top Ministry position. Rufus Scrimgeour was Head Auror before becoming the Minister.

--------------

I always consider the British Wizarding Government a hell lot worse than the US/UK Government, and if they can thrive in that cutthroat snake pit, they would even eat Frank Underwood for breakfast.

I don't think they would just become average corrupt politicians, but really insidious villains with an almost perfect public image (model families, modest living). They run on great sounding platforms (equality, justice, love, peace, and prosperity), have hordes of hardcore followers (DA, Quidditch fans, Hogwarts graduates, werewolves, fanboys/girls), controlled a loyal military (the DMLE), become filthy rich (confiscated Death Eater wealth, memory charmed Muggles, Weasley owned businesses, royalties from their 'heroic deeds'), dominate the public media (Ginny is the real force behind The Daily Prophet, Luna owns the next largest publication), are utterly ruthless to their enemies (real and perceived), and most importantly, believe what they are doing is right and protect their 'loved ones'.

Threats to their power base would have unfortunate accidents or die in embarrassing ways (what? he had a heart attack while engaging in autoerotic asphyxiation? oh dear...), or even accidentally blow themselves up while attempting dark rituals. People who oppose them politically would have their positions undercut through media and rumors. Some pain in the ass would be taken care of by street violence, such as an angry mob demanding the head of that 'Slanderous Rita'. Meanwhile, Hermione would be the calm, thoughtful, considerate leader who seems really nice, while Harry would be the brave, energetic, and powerful hero who keeps everyone safe.

I can very well imagine the following conversation: "Yes, it really is necessary, and I prepared this 400 page document that makes it all clear, so you go read it and come back if there's anything you don't understand, and we'll have a lovely talk about it." (person leaves) "Harry, I want that arse investigated so hard it scours his floors. Find something, and if you can't find something, make something up. Perhaps plant some naughty ideas in his mind first."

And none of the above violates what JKR has said about postwar.

"How half-bloods and Muggleborns haven't started their own revolution I will never understand."

Tracey heard the scraping of Hermione's sponge stop and looked up from her own work, to see the Muggleborn witch staring at her.

"Do you think we could win that?"

"If I say 'yes', are you going to start a revolution, Granger?"

"... Maybe. If, purely hypothetically, I did, will you join?"

"... Maybe."
