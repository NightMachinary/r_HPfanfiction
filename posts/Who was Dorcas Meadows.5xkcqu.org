She was a member of the original Order of the Phoenix. Mad Eye told Harry that she was so important to the cause that Voldy killed her himself. What made her so important? And are there any stories about her? Especially from her point of view?


** She can be anything you want her to be. In all things but her name she is an OC.

I picture (and write) her as a very high horse in the Ministry. In one of my story-outlines she was the Undersecretary to Minister Bagnold and an iron-fist kind of woman. The cane to Bagnold's candy, so to say. I wrote her as a cutting-edge Legilimens, an Anti-Death Eater hardliner who's actions and orders incarcerated as many as they left dead in some Knockturn Alley alcove. She had a talent to snoop out traitors in the ranks of the Ministry and make them either see the errors of their ways or make them vanish.

Voldemort killed her because she was the reason his takeover attempts failed in the first war. While Snape was the spy, and Alastor the General, she was the cutthroat politician in Dumbledore's ranks that kept the Ministry running despite the sabotage and treason.

But as I said, completely OC.

That thing is far from done - or even getting started. Hell, I still have Bloodmoon and The Salem Settlement to write, so don't expect this one before 2018.

But yeah, here is the bit I have by now. Meadows isn't in it yet, though and it is very *very* much a sketch (so no complaining about stale dialogue and such :P).

[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/16YLDhQpmpMD8dRWjkPvk402rmmoz3N4EE9458NadKdg/edit?usp=sharing]]

Short summary: Harry finds out that he isn't the son of Lily and James, but rather of Bellatrix and Voldemort himself though a journal written by Bellatrix. He follows the breadcrumbs and finds an enchantment on the tapestry, hiding the relation.

The actual written part features the days after he found the tapestry.

Meadows will play a role later as leader of a subgroup within the Order, which has been vital to the kidnapping and safekeeping of Harry.

** She may have been a friend of Lily Potter's, and was most likely skilled at magic, if Voldemort himself tracked her down and killed her.

Canon doesn't provide much information on her.

*** You might be confusing her with [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/McKinnon_family][the McKinnon family]] who were slaughtered by Travers and other death eaters in 81. Their deaths were revealed by a letter from Lily to Sirius in 1981 which was found in Sirius's bedroom by Harry in the beginning of DH in 1997. Lily wrote that she cried all night, which people have interpreted to mean she had a closer friendship with Marlene McKinnon and/or her family than other members of the Order.

**** I'm not. My post could actually apply to any of them as it's rather vague in who it is talking about.

Anyways - I'm inferencing that Dorcas may have been friends with Lily because she looked rather young in the Order picture. Not much to go on, but it's the most info we have.

We know so little about Dorcas and Marlene that they're for all intents and purposes, OCs.

** Amelia Bones was also killed by Lord Voldemort:

#+begin_quote
  'Amelia Bones. Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. We think He Who Must Not Be Named may have murdered her in person, because she was a very gifted witch-and all evidence was that she put up a real fight.'
#+end_quote

I assume that Voldemort killed any powerful witch or wizard that challenged his authority personally.

She's in Not Fade Away by Slide, and although not a point of view character, she is still an important character.

  She fights for a world she hates as much as it hates her. It never stops; not until the world of magic burns to ashes to be reborn, or destroys Lily Evans and all caught in her wake.

** What we know for sure about her : member of the Order, and personally killed by Voldemort.\\
Voldemort personally killed very few people: his strongest opponents (Amelia Bones, Alastor Moody) and people whose death has a deeper meaning (his father represent his link with muggles, the Potters represent his destined death, Hepzibah Smith is descended from a founder and own 2 of their 5 surviving artifacts, Charity Burbage openly defies him in the Prophet). Pick your choice, but she was probably a badass and openly opposed him.
