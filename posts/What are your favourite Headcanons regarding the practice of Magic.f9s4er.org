I mean things that aren't really stated in canon, like "Fiendfyre requires the permanent sacrifice of a single drop of blood", or "the Patronus Charm slowly sucks the happiness from your chosen Memory until it doesn't have any emotion anymore", just things of that nature.

I personally like "To be able to use Legilimency you need to have mastered Occlumency first", as well.


** The Fidelius charm is a "light art" that requires true, complete and uncoerced trust to cast, much as the Patronus charm requires happiness (or, in another headcanon, the feeling of being protected). This is why we never see the Death Eaters or Voldemort use it, despite how effective it is.

Magic doesn't really interfere with technology by its nature. If it did, muggles in London would notice the areas where their tech doesn't work and some would figure it out. Rather, there is a specific spell to interfere with technology that is cast at Hogwarts, so that muggleborns get used to living without it.

Most of the "rules" taught at Hogwarts are just learning tools to help kids get a feel for their magic. If silent casting is possible, then the incantations don't really matter. Other rules, like it being impossible to create food, are made up for economic reasons (if they can create animals that can be turned into food, there's no way they can't create food). A lot of magic is about belief, so if people believe something is impossible, they can't do it.

Wands are semi-sentient, living entities that form a symbiotic, or even parasitic relationship with witches and wizards. Wandless magic can be just as powerful, since the power comes from the magical person and not the wand, but it is unpredictable and unfocused without the proper mental discipline. Wands also create a false sense of their own necessity. The wand chooses the wizard, makes things easier and more convenient for him, then feeds on him and makes him think he can't do magic without it.

The Dursleys were actually getting paid for Harry's expenses, but spent it on themselves instead. Making him feel like a burden was a deliberate and cruel choice to justify making him do all the chores.

My headcanon for this is that all transfiguration is magic forcing an object into a form, and keeping this form requires constant flow of magic, when the flow is cut off the object will revert to its natural form even if taken apart while transfigured

** I don't know if I'd call it my favorite headcanon, it's just my headcanon but I was DMing with a friend on an HP forum and shared my thoughts on how the pureblood supremacy beliefs stemmed from how muggles worshiped and glorified ancient figures who could transform water into wine and multiply foodstuffs to feed the hungry in a "They know we're better than them, see how they worship us!" mentality. And that back in the day people weren't necessarily exceptionally good people, but saw hungry people and had the capability to feed them so they did and were a little baffled about why people would then follow them around extolling their greatness and kindness. Sort of a wizarding world's Life of Brian.

I was actually thinking about this a few years ago and tried to find the message where I wrote all this out but I had deleted it. 😭

** Regarding Legilimency and Occlumency, I think it's far more likely to be the other way around; Occlumency takes mental discipline and training, but Legilimency is just a spell. There's even a hint that Harry does it by accident once or twice. You would probably need Occlumency to be really good at Legilimency, but not to use it on someone completely untrained.

Rich purebloods like Malfoy wear robes enchanted with protective magic so when curses were invented that could bypass magical protections, they were outlawed by the Wizengamot almost immediately. They were fearful of muggleborn assassins catching them by surprise and killing them whereas the entrail-expelling curse would be stopped by their enchanted clothing (or amulets, jewelry, etc).

*** The killing curse is unforgivable because it has one purpose, and one purpose only. To kill.

The entrail-expelling curse was originally created by a confused healer helping a muggle doctor get access to organs without cutting into people. It didn't really work as intended.

***** IMO it's that all the other ones can be blocked by magic, and have reversible effects.

Sure, entrail expelling curse sounds bad, but if you cast a protego you're good to go - much easier than conjuring a shield of metal (fanon) or animating a statue to protect you (something we've only seen Dumbledore do). Also, if there is a counter-curse, it's not all bad - you get a few minutes long window to reverse the effect before someone croaks for good.

****** IMO, the reason is two fold - one, which is your point, it is unblockable save for very specific circumstances (involving the caster promising to spare a person, then going back on that promise, and THEN going on to try and kill that person's child).

The second reason is that your intent matters when it comes to Crucio and Avada Kedavra. You have to enjoy the person's suffering for Crucio to work. And you have to genuinely want to see someone dead for the Killing Curse to work. A successfully cast Killing Curse is basically a confession that you were trying to kill someone.

** Unpopular opinions here. Wand motion, practice, intent, incantation are all important to learn a spell. With practice, you may not need all the aspects but they're important. If it was purely intent or belief, an insane person could destroy the world. Killing curse is a powerful curse with the sole drawback of being power-intensive. I talked about why it'd be unforgivable elsewhere. Basic bloodmagic involves placing drops of blood on your wand which are then consumed as you cast spells which are strengthened by your blood (got this from some fic). Occulumency is about "clearing your mind" whereas legilimency is about using retrieval cues to view memories. Both take practice and are like an art. Fidelius hides location and secret keeper cannot be under a fidelius as well. Wards exist and involve runes, enchantments and combinations of both. You may use a rune to anchor an enchantment, for instance. Enchanted clothing is very common especially with protection against muggle weapons. Magic is very powerful and inefficient. A protego is very powerful (nuclear bomb energy) but it's very inefficient hence why it only stops a few other spells and has little other effect. Wards can be powerful because they increase both power /and/ efficiency. Magic is far more efficient against non-magical things. Dumbledore could cast under the cruciatus a shield that could stop a nuclear bomb's shockwave provided the shockwave carried no magical residue.

** I'm thinking about exploring Hogwarts as a sentient entity in my fic... and the likelihood that any dwelling absorbs a bit of the soul of the people who live in the dwelling, especially if they have an emotional attachment to the place. I think Hogwarts would be among the most powerfully sentient dwellings in the UK because of the generations of wixen to pass through its corridors during a pivotal time in their development.

** With all the many interpretations of the Fidelius charm in fanfic as well as its interpretation in canon, I prefer this. The Fidulius Charm hides any secret (not just buildings) in the soul of a secret keeper as long as the secret is in fact a secret. It can only be used to hide things that are already secret, not to make things secret by altering memories. Once cast, the secret is undiscoverable by any means other than voluntary revealing by the secret keeper. It can't be discovered through magical or mundane means, even through legilimancy on those who have been told the secret.

Dementors used to have a place in the magical ecosystem as solo hunting forest dwellers. They feed on despair, not happiness, which is poison to them. They destroy happiness in order to feed on the despair of their victim. Originally they would disable victims lost in the woods with their despair before bringing them back to their lair, where they would feed off their despair until all happy memories were gone and the victim was close to death. Then they would finish by feasting on the soul, filled with the concentrated despair of a lifetime and without any poisonous happiness.

As humans destroyed the woods, they lost their habitats. In order to feed they were forced to group together in packs, as only in groups were they powerful enough to overcome the happiness coming off of the large amount of humans present in villages. They chose times of suffering and loss as the easiest moments to attack. Often bursting into rooms where a loved one lay dying, feeding off the despair of family members, and consuming the soul of the almost deceased before fleeing, giving rise to the common mental image for death as a cloaked and hooded figure.

Azkaban prison was the ministry's attempt to preserve the statute of secrecy by providing a compromise with the dementors, giving them the despair of inmates to feed on as well as the occasional soul. As any compromise, the dementors aren't happy, being solitary creatures they prefer isolation, and they don't like to share souls, which only one can consume. This is the reason they were open to Voldemorts offer.

There are two types of Boggarts. The most common one feeds on residual magical energy from magical homes. They hide in small places in unused areas to avoid discovery and take on the form of simple scary things that will hopefully force those that discover them to flee and leave them alone (Lupins Boggart). The second type feeds on fear the way dementors feed on despair. They hide in small places in areas that are more likely to be opened like desk drawers and closets. They take more personal and painful fears in order to paralyze their victim with fear so they can feed (Molly's boggart). There are rumors of a third type in New England that actually feeds on people.

The Killing Curse was developed as a mercy killing spell for humanely ending the lives of livestock. A spell that instantly and painlessly kills its victim doesn't sound like something created by a dark lord to spare victims suffering. The spell originally only worked on animals, and using it on a human requires either immense force of will, immense hatred, or immense apathy. The last is how dark wizards generally use the spell to kill muggles or even muggleborn, not viewing them as people. Voldemort can use the spell with impunity as everyone is less of a real person than him in his eyes.

I'm usually not a fan of things like this, as the dark arts and dark magic are a very real thing in canon, but I like your framing for the spell.

Perhaps that was the original frame of mind you had to have to cast it, but over the years people experimented around with the spell, trying to find a way to get around the restriction so they could use it on people. In essence, the spell would require that you don't see something as human, but it also technically works if you don't see something as /worth living/.

However, the Killing Curse is unforgiveable for a reason - there are dark curses that kill much more gruesomely, yet they don't land you in Azkaban for life. There has to be some reason behind it - maybe the original creator of the spell was a borderline dark wizard and just worked some dark magic into the spell because they didn't know the difference? I don't see a spell with such dark taint attached to be anything used by the general population.

I suppose it could be that "Dark" as we now know it was only discovered recently, alongside its visceral consequences? Like, before people just died sometimes, but at some point the deaths, madness and corruption were proven to be caused by a specific kind of magic.

**** I would imagine that the requirements to cast the spell remove any doubt of reasonable use. You can't claim self defense if the hatred required to power the spell is an intent to murder. The apathy required to cast the spell likewise highlights a disregard for human life that is unforgivable.

I visualize the mercy spell as a white light rather than the green of the killing curse. The spell is definitely warped by it's new use and probably has a corrupting effect on the caster as well.

**** My head canon is that the killing curse is in fact a murder curse and an integral part of the horcrux ritual.

You can't just want to kill the target, you have to want to murder them in cold blood. “Oh my god, if i don't kill them they'll kill me” won't power the curse, purely “this person will die by my hand, even if i have to do it in their sleep” sort of intent.

** Incantations and wand movements are crutches to help cast the spell, and not really needed.

Also, non-verbal casting and silent casting are not entirely the same - i see little reason as to why vocalization instead of saying the incantation in your head would be that much different (unless JKR has no internal monologue and it is hard for her) - and silent casting is just that - maybe a little bit quicker, but you ultimately gain nothing but silence. True non-verbal casting enables you to cast spells without that, thus enabling you to cast spells much more rapidly, and also enables you to invent new spells with pure intent/magic control once you're good enough at it - and then you can try and find the crutches of incantation and wand movement to help spread the spell.

It also kind of explains why some really usefull and easy spells (like lumos) are canonically rather new - it used to be an older method of using magic - much harder, but ultimately more useful if one got skilled enough. It's still taught at Hogwarts, only in later years because it is ultimately a very difficult thing to do.

Rituals, in turn, are an even older way of 'vocalizing' magic use, predating wand use - wand use is basically 'rituals condensed' - and they were swiftly abandoned once wand spread - after all, saying a few words and waving a stick is much faster than drawing a shape on the ground and using a long chant. They are sometimes used as an alternative route to finding new spells - you start with a ritual (described by runes and/or arithmancy with all the right shapes and chants) and proceed to 'solve' it and condense it for wand use - sort of like using a set of data describing some phenomenon to come up with a neat equation.

** The only difference between light and dark magic is sacrifice. Light magic runs on nothing but pure, renewable magical energy. Dark magic uses some sort of sacrifice or tribute to power or influence it.

For instance, Lumos simply pulls on the users magic to create a ball of light, while Nox simply causes the flow of magic to cease.

The unforgivable curses, on the other hand, chip away at the users soul. Other dark spells might require a life to be taken, like creating a horcrux or some sort of dark ritual.

*** I like this one.

Does this system mean that with enough knowledge about and skill in detecting when and what sort of sacrifice is needed, one can cast the dark arts "safely"? As in, without causing irreparable damage to your soul, your psyche, or your sanity?

Some parts of the dark arts, especially the deeper ones such as Horcruxes, most likely can't be cast without consequence, as that spell for instance needs to take part of your soul to have any sort of effect, but to for example cast an unforgiveable, does there exist some sort of material, symbolic item or otherwise external condition which will redirect the sacrifice away from the caster and onto something else?

In mythology for example Druids used certain items, plants, animals and such to channel the powers of nature, could it be that the more powerful dark arts really only cause damage to the caster because nobody knows how to correctly cast them? For instance, perhaps you need to ritualistically sacrifice a branch of a tree that's been struck by lightning to evoke the necessary energy for a Killing curse, or something similar?

Perhaps the doing-away with ritual magic wasn't researched properly, resulting in spells that essentially force the effect of a particular ritual, but without the sacrifice. This means that the spell tears at your very being in an attempt to fuel itself - so your cruciatus curse is slowly chipping away your empathy, humanity, desires etc in order to power itself?

**** I never put too much thought into it, but those are some really interesting ideas.

I think transfiguration and alchemy might have been contested when the dark/light laws were being written up, but ultimately it was decided that the only sacrifice of these spells was the actual target of them, so they could be considered light, especially since transfiguration is often temporary.

I agree that a well trained witch or wizard could possibly find substitutes for the sacrifices required, perhaps something that's thematically similar.

** Except for a handful of things, nothing in 'Dark' Magic is actually evil. The whole stigma attached to it comes from centuries of social taboos and Ministries, along with the ICW, going on a warpath against highly powerful and spectacular magic, both out of fear of losing their own power structure and for the Statute not being broken. Like how the Killing Curse is this unfathomably evil spell that will smash your soul, but instead it's just a social stigma against killing another witch/wizard because of how few they are and thinning the herd any further will probably mean extinction. People that see through the sham and are branded as 'dark wizards/witches' wear the title as a badge of honor.

I also love a concept I saw in a few fics regarding the Patronus Charm, that you don't need a happy memory per se, but to feel happiness.
