During Harry's sacrifice in the Forbidden Forest, he meets Dumbledore and soul-scarred Voldemort in the train station. We know why Harry and Voldemort are there, but why is Dumbledore? Harry sends Babymort along to the afterlife and pops back into his own body. He goes on to reflect Voldemort's killing curse back on its caster. Voldemort's body lands lifeless and doesn't stir. Then it takes a deep wheezing breath and says, "Oh, you defeated Voldemort?"

The Dark Lord props himself up on his elbow, and looks at Harry, red eyes twinkling in delight "You /did/ do the thing properly, didn't you?"

It takes a despicable and dark act to create a horcrux.

But attaching a piece of soul to a horcrux is super easy--barely an inconvenience. A fact which Snape and Dumbledore discovered together during Harry's 6th year, and incorporated into their plans.


** It's much more likely that the Resurrection Stone or the snitch that contained it was Dumbledore's horcrux. That's why he met Harry in Limbo. Where he went on to overcome his spirit and possess his body, banter with Voldemort like to a young student, call him Tom, offer him a chance at redemption, etc later even give "Harry's" son an atrocious name like Albus Severus.
