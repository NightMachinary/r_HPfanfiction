Looking for a Lord Potter-Black will-reading story with a manipulative Dumbledore without the 'paying the Weasleys to be friends with Harry' nonsense. I don't mind the 'Lord Potter-Black' genre, but I'm tired of the 'Molly's dosing Harry' and 'Ginny is a starhumper' stuff. I kinda like the Weasleys and I'm a fan of Hinny so I'm looking for something in that vein, that's more about the Dumbledore bashing and less about dragging the Weasleys into it.
