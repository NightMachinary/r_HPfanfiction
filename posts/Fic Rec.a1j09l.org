I just read a fic that I think readers here will enjoy---

linkao3 ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6468793/chapters/14805982]])

I hope the bot works; if not I'll try again in a bit.

Harry and his team of Aurors, all of whom are former DA members, Search for one last Death Eater who is as elusive as he is cruel, cunning, skillful and sadistic. The case becomes personal for Harry and he won't stop until he's identified and captured the criminal.

Great battle scenes and a fantastic ride! H/G at the end, really no romance, thankfully.


** Damn, I screwed it up. I'll try the bot again. Apologies to bot users.
