It's easy to forget that Dumbledore is an avid ten pin bowler. Any fics where this gets brought up/ plays a major role?


** In Renegade Cause, Dumbledore uses a hundred enchanted bowling balls against Voldemort. One of the best duels in HP fanfiction.

  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks

*** I remember reading this a while back. Kinda a shame the sequel got abandoned. Tried to reread it again not long ago, forgot how ridiculous the section before Hogwarts was.

** I recall a fic where there was a throwaway scene of DD holding a faculty meeting at a bowling alley, during a game all the teachers played (except Snape, who was a typical sourpuss). I can't recall the name or anything else about it, sorry.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.
