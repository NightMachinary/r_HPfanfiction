I am looking for some good Snamione (Snape/Hermione) fics. I recently read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22065178/chapters/52658686][Do Not Go Gentle]] by SenLinYu and it just hit me in all the best ways. I need something similar to this -- something where Hermione is of age, and the arc is at least somewhat believable and in-character. I've been searching A03 for something similar, but so far haven't really found anything like it. I'm desperate for some recs!


** I'm not sure how to like make a bot bring up the link but I really liked Another Dream by dragoon811 on fanfiction.net. Snape cannot speak because of the damage to his cords due to Nagini. It's not super angsty, its one that I have read a few times.

** I've not read Do Not Go Gentle but the first that come to mind is Chasing the Sun by Loten (FF.net and ao3).

*** Thanks for the rec! I have read a good deal of Chasing the Sun and I did like some aspects of it, but I didn't quite get through the whole thing. I might try and go back to it now that you've reminded me!

  The last thing Severus can remember is overhearing a prophecy in a dingy, goat-scented pub. Now there's a James Potter clone with Lily's eyes, a much aged Minerva McGonagall, and an infuriatingly familiar woman with wild hair all saying he is not a loyal Death Eater. Looking in a mirror proves that he is, indeed, suddenly pushing fifty. All in all, not his best day.

** There is a Snape/Hermione story written by one of my favorite writers that I have never read in full for some weird reason. It's called "When a Lioness Fights."

You might have more luck finding SS/HG recs here: [[https://sshgreview.wordpress.com/]]

*** Thank you - I will check it out! That's actually what started me on this Snape/Hermione kick. I read a lot of Dramione, and I read the fic I mentioned above by one of my favourite Dramione authors after exhausting her other work. And I just unexpectedly loved it so much.

** A few fics that I liked were

Post Tenebras, Lux by Loten

Basically, Snape was thought to be dead, but Hermione runs into him 10 years later and helps him integrate back into wizarding society.

linkffn(6578435)

Another one is Unquestionable Love by CRMediaGal

There's a prequel as well that's really good, but only read it if you don't mind the fact that Severus and Hermione get together while she's on the run (she's 17 when they get together though so if you don't like that, don't read the prelude) :)

linkffn(7448313)

A Murder of Crows by Hogwarts 91 is also pretty decent

Basically it's set 14 years after the war - Snape has been in stasis the entire time, and he wakes up and returns to Hogwarts, where Hermione is teaching. It gets better in the second half :)

linkffn(4407394)

I have a few more, so if you'd like me to put them here as well I can do that :DD

Hopefully there's one here that you'll like/you haven't read yet!

  "After Darkness, Light." A chance meeting ten years after the war may not be just a coincidence, and may prove to have very far-reaching consequences. A story of many things, but primarily of healing. SS/HG; rated M for later chapters. Complete.
