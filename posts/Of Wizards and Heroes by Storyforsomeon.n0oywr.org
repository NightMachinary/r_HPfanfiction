One of if not the best HP/MCU crossovers I've read. Harry is a BAMF Master of Death, takes names and kicks ass. Don't trust my description, I'm really bad at stuff like that.

The fic is marked Harry/Loki, and as one who usually stay away from Slash, I can say that it's easy enough to ignore and even enjoy. The fic is well written and have an excellent story telling.

My biggest issue is that I assume the author is English, as all the characters have a British accent.
