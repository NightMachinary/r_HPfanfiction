I really don't like titles that mean nothing, like "All the leaves turned brown (but I kissed him anyway)" or other existential crud like that. (I made that title up, rather than hate on a particular author or story, but you've all seen those.)

I really like clever titles like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16889169][Sirius Black is Sick of Your Parenting Advice]] (Lomonoaaeren) and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24357193][Lord Voldemort Had Never Heard Such Bullshit]] (shaqb4), especially since they usually indicate humorous stories.

Please link me any stories with similar title construction.

- The only thing I won't read is femslash (or is it femmeslash?), so anything else goes.
- I prefer Harry Potter fanfics that actually, you know, have Harry Potter in them. He doesn't have to be the main character. This is just a preference, not an absolute (see above).
- No trigger warnings necessary: I can read tags and I'm not so fragile that I can't find the "close" button.
- I don't have accounts on tumblr, ficwad, or wattpad, so skip those unless the stories are available to non-members. (I've never even been to the wattpad site but ficwad's okay.)

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

#+begin_quote
  The clues were there and they were not impossible to put together. A person didn't have to be breathtakingly clever and named Hermione Granger to realize that Professor Remus Lupin was a werewolf. The regular absences were covered up well and then explained away with the dismissive ease of someone who had been making these excuses all their life, but there were still students who could take a break from their own busy lives just long enough to make the necessary leap of logic. - Some snippets of realization with some random Hogwarts students.

  ‚ÄúWhat's carrying a bag of flour around all day for a term supposed to teach us about parenting, I ask you?‚ÄùThe one where the Marauders have to take care of flour babies - or at least, not completely destroy them.

  Fred opened the book and began to write. He only got a few words down before the diary absorbed them, the ink vanishing without a trace, prompting George to lean in closer to observe.‚ÄúMaybe this is some elaborate joke on Ginny's part to educate us on proper brotherly behaviour?‚Äù George mused, just as new words began to appear on the empty page. Well, that seemed a bit ambitious for a first year...‚ÄòHello. To whom might I be writing?' Or: The Weasley twins are the ones to obtain Tom Riddle's diary.
