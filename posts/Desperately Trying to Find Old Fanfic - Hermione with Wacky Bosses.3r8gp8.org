Hi All, I've been looking for this fanfiction I've read a long time ago. I remember bits and pieces of it, and I can't remember if it was DM/HG or HP/HG. It is post-Hogwarts, Hermione works at the ministry for these two really wacky, crazy old men who are supposedly rather brilliant. At first she was dismayed by the nuttiness of her bosses, but then she finds some order in their madness.

I remember that Harry would pick her up from work, and comment about her bosses, but she would defend them rigorously.

I really really hope someone has an idea what I'm talking about. I really enjoyed it.
