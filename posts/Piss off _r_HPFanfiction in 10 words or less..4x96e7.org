*** Poetic rhythm-wise, you have two descriptors for the subject and one for the object. My mind stumbled on the imbalance and took the first one for the second one as well:

The beautiful bushy-haired bookworm gazed into his bushy-haired onyx orbs.

*** "Slash and harems that lead to mpreg is the best type of fanfic" was the original.

I find it interesting that you removed both the 'harem' and 'MPREG' parts, which are not normally favored by the same person at the same time (implicit in your removal of those terms). Lots of people like slash, and while saying it is the greatest genre is annoying, it is no more annoying that claiming any genre/trope/pairing is the greatest.
