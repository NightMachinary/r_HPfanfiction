Hi guys, I'm looking to brush up on technique to write some nail biting, edge of the seat, wizarding action! So please let me have your recommendations for the best of the best. If as well as linking you could have a guess at the chapter in which the action appears I would be most appreciative.

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** Ch.11 of linkffn(8175132) Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool has Grindelwald v Jamie (fem!harry). It has both a proxy battle (his summons v her summons) and an all out magical slugging match between two magical heavy weights.

Things you will find in the battle: Tanks, a Battleship, Godzilla, Hogsmeade as collateral damage, and localised typhoons. Enjoy (along with the rest of the story in my opinion)

edit: Ch. 11 meaning the 11th chapter posted on FFN. It is titled "Chapter the Tenth"

** Linkffn(Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness by Thanfiction)

I'd definitely recommend reading the entire story. Seriously the best FanFiction I've read. The last four chapters or so are the Battle of Hogwarts from Neville's perspective. But the whole story has various fights/battles.
