:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There is this story on AO3, which I remember reading.

Harry gets a letter from Gringotts telling him that Lily was actually the Weasley couple's oldest daughter.

I think it was similar to a prompt in that it didn't seem that the writer wanted to expand it, but I wanted to read it again, all the same.

I had posted this a while back, but nobody seemed to remember, so I am asking again.

Edit: He gets the letter before 3rd or 4th year.

** He could get that letter after James Sirius is born and feel all Jon Snow

** Only thing I can find about this is a mugglenet article: [[https://www.mugglenet.com/2004/04/lily-evans-a-weasley/]]

Did some searches on AO3, are you sure it was posted on there? Filtered to Molly and Lily and then just searched keywords like daughter, adopt. Didn't find anything.

I did however find linkffn(A Mother's Woes by Miss.Heartache), but it doesn't mention a letter, Molly just straight up tells Harry.

*** Pretty sure that was it, found it on reddit in some good Weasleys searches. But this is nice as well. Thanks.

Edit: That said though, this Harry is weirdly happy about being a pureblood.
