In many hp fanfictions I've read, either someone or Harry has the skill to bat a spell from hitting them. Is there any logical explanation for this or is it just pure fandom?

Like maybe they have a force field or smth?


** Mad-eye Moody (or rather Barty Crouch Jr.) taught his students spell deflection in Harry's fourth year.

  Hermione hung back in their next Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson to ask Professor Moody something. The rest of the class were very eager to leave; Moody had given them such a rigorous test of hex-deflection that many of them were nursing small injuries. Harry had such a bad case of Twitchy Ears, he had to hold his hands clamped over them as he walked away from the class.

*** Also, while the movies don't really count as canon, I believe the fight between Snape and McGonagall in DH Pt. 2 has Snape batting some spells away.

*** Unfortunately, this is an example of unclear language by JKR (though hex-deflection and fantastic beasts certainly shows the existence of spell "batting").

Deflection in this instance referred to spell blocking which totally nullifies a spell. It does not bat it towards away from the user..

  *Pointing his wand at nothing in particular, he gave it an upward flick and said Levicorpus! inside his head. ‚ÄúAaaaaaaargh!‚Äù There was a flash of light* and the room was full of voices: Everyone had woken up as Ron had let out a yell. Harry sent Advanced Potion-Making flying in panic; Ron was dangling upside down in midair as though an invisible hook had hoisted him up by the ankle.

  Malfoy wheeled around, drawing his wand. Instinctively, Harry pulled out his own. Malfoy's hex *missed Harry by inches, shattering the lamp on the wall beside him*; *Harry threw himself sideways, thought Levicorpus! and flicked his wand, but Malfoy* */blocked/* *the jinx* and raised his wand for another ---

  ‚Äú*Cruc ---*‚Äù But Snape /parried/ the curse, knocking Harry backward off his feet *before he could complete it*; Harry rolled over and scrambled back up again as the huge Death Eater behind him yelled, ‚ÄúIncendio!‚Äù Harry heard an explosive bang and a dancing orange light spilled over all of them: Hagrid's house was on fire. ‚ÄúFang's in there, yer evil --- !‚Äù Hagrid bellowed. ‚Äú*Cruc ---*‚Äù yelled Harry for the second time, aiming for the figure ahead illuminated in the dancing firelight, but Snape /blocked/ the spell again. Harry could see him sneering. ‚ÄúNo Unforgivable Curses from you, Potter!‚Äù he shouted over the rushing of the flames, Hagrid's yells, and the wild yelping of the trapped Fang. ‚ÄúYou haven't got the nerve or the ability ---‚Äù ‚Äú*Incarc ---*‚Äù Harry roared, but Snape /deflected/ the spell with an almost lazy flick of his arm.

  ‚Äú*Stupe ---*‚Äù ‚Äú/Blocked/ again and again and again until you learn to keep your mouth shut and your mind closed, Potter!‚Äù sneered Snape, /deflecting/ the curse once more. ‚ÄúNow come!‚Äù he shouted at the huge Death Eater behind Harry. ‚ÄúIt is time to be gone, before the Ministry turns up ---‚Äù

Bolding was done to show how the spell is totally nullified, it even prevents them from being finished. Italics are to show how the language used to describe it includes deflected and parried.

** Personally, my theory is that they have a 'point; with a physical projection of their magic, it can't be like protego, because it's very magic-intensive, and repels hexes and curses? So sort of like the raquet part of the tennis bat.

** I like the idea that if a caster makes a shield smaller it gets stronger. Protego is big, but if it's the size of your palm maybe it blocks way more. Downside is it's only at the tip of the wand, but would be budget to cast, just hard to use.

** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12191520/1/The-Last-Mage-Of-Krypton][book 1]] of the Harry of El series, Flitwick reflexively demonstrates how to deflect a spell in class by wrapping magic around his wand and using it as a small pseudo-shield, a technique known as the Duelist's Shield.\\
When he sees a modified version of the technique which expands the effect to form a pseudo-sword, it takes him only a few seconds to mentally reverse-engineer it and apply it to his own wand. He then uses it to spar against the one who created the variant, as well as her three friends, in a dazzling display of why he is a Charms /Master/.

Later in the series, Hermione (with the aid of a couple of teachers) invents a jinx which uses the Duelists reflexive use of the Duelist's Shield against them. Filius is highly impressed by the sneakiness it shows.

** In books the only ways to deflect spells are by using "Protego" or variations of it or to summon physical objects between you and the spells as Dumbledore (statues, Fawkes) and Voldemort (shield) do during the Battle of DoM. I think the idea comes from the movies where Snape just bats spells away with the tip of his wand and Voldemort does that with bare hands.
