** Part of the family on fanfiction.net, it starts with sirius joining the addams family and then raises harry in the second part of it [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10945622/1/]]

The entire harveste addams series on fanfiction.net

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6356100/1/Harveste-Addams-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire]]

I'm pretty sure that part of the family has some bashing in it though, so you might want to look out for that.

*** I have totally devoured that series and I'm currently almost done with the Goblet of Fire, but it is heartbreaking that the Half-Blood Prince and the Deathly Hallows are missing. Do you have any idea why? :(

***** I searched for the author and found its Twitter account, but there has been no update to that account either since 2015. I am worried about something bad happening to the author, but I have no idea how to confirm its safety. At this point, I just wish it gave a signal of being active, so that our hope of reading the complete series someday can remain alive. :'(

It's so sad...I became quite invested in Harveste and his story. U_U

#+begin_quote
  AU - 1999 - A transgender witch, Wednesday Addams, has accepted the position of Sorceress Apprentice at Hogwart's. Upon arrival, she quickly becomes involved in the political drama of the school and the Ministry of Magic, not to mention the chaos that surrounds the battle between the Light and the Dark that seems centered around Neville Longbottom, the Boy-Who-Lived.
