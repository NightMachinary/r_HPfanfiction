Maybe there was betrothal contract made before he was born, maybe his parents survived and agreed to marry him off, maybe Dumbledore signed some contracts for the 'greater good', maybe he was kidnapped and forced to marry someone, maybe Fudge was paid off to force the issue.

The how doesn't really matter what i'm looking for past that is.

There's some fics with betrothal contracts but usually they end up going Harry's way. "Oh Sirius made me Lord Black when he died and now i'm going to have to marry the beautiful Daphne Greengrass, she's not all that bad! Turns out we have a lot in common! I love her!"

There's some slightly darker than these. Maybe Harry was born a girl (or they do the whole mpreg thing that i'm not a fan of) and they try to force her to marry Draco Malfoy. I read a femharry one like this before except it quickly went into a route of "Oh he's not actually that bad!" and while it was unfinished it was a Harry/Draco fic and we all know that means they'll eventually grow to accept and love each other.

What i'm looking for is something akin to what happens in the NCIS Crossover "Leaving Home" by Jade94... where everyone from Dumbledore to Remus to Fudge to the Weasleys to most of the Wizarding World wants Harry to marry Draco because apparently Draco is half-veela half-vampire and they try to claim Harry is his 'lifemate'.

In actuality the Malfoys want access to the Potter and Black fortunes because they "only" have 20 million galleons in their account with the contract between the two stating outright that after the marriage the Malfoys would control both the Potter and Black accounts.

Harry doesn't want any part of it obviously stating unequivocally that he's not gay or bi and refuses to play Housewife to Draco. They try to force it and Remus and some aurors attempt to arrest him until the 'bonding ceremony' so Harry implements "Plan B" and runs off to America after making sure his money and properties are safe.

â€‹

Basically just a fic where there's a contract or otherwise forced marriage attempt to someone that Harry doesn't and will never love. Maybe the marriage attempt is successful and he/she sets out to destroy the one he/she's married to and those that forced it or maybe he/she escapes before they can get him/her and flees to another country and lives a new life or maybe he/she turns a bit dark because of the repeated laws and attempts and sets out to destroy the backwards society of Magical Britain.

Just one where a forced marriage is attempted/happens and Harry is and remains unhappy about the whole thing and works to do something about it instead of just accepting it and making the best of things.

*** That has downright scary implications. Someone posted a review about it that made me think... if a Veela child could forcefully bond an unwilling mate with a kiss then laws would have to be changed declaring them dangerous. They'd be ranked among Vampires and Werewolves when it comes to Dark Creatures.

Thanks. That's more or less what I was looking for.

**** If this could actually happen wizards would go insane - they'd kill the Veela if it didn't threaten the life of the wizard. They'd probably fine the family into bankruptcy and imprison at least one parent to make an example.
