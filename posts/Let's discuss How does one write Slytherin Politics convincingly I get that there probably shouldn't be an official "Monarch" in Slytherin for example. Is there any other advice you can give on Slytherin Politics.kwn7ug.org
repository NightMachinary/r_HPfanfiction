** Go for Regency-era social politicking. I don't know whether you're using lords or ladies or going for more of a landed gentry vibe, but the Regency era placed a lot of emphasis on social class. The Victorian Era was directly after it, but the Regency era happened mostly pre-industrial revolution, so it might fit better with the Wizarding World. Additionally, the Victorian era was all about reform, so the Regency era would be a better fit if you want a wizarding world that isn't trying to completely reform itself.

In a story with lords and ladies, it would be much more literal, with layers of power like a duke being more important than an earl who is more important than a lord. A lot of 'Lordly politics' fics forget that there are multiple types of lordships in Britain and that Lord is the catchall term for anyone who's a member of the peerage.

If you aren't doing Lords and Ladies, and still going for politics, you'd probably be going for more of a landed gentry, with purebloods being the wealthy families with land. In this case, it would be about social class, preserving inheritance, and being well-mannered. You would see Slytherins trying to make connections to other Slytherins, with lots of friendships going around. It's all about /always/ being civil.

It would probably be a bit much to go over here, but for reference material, I recommend going on a Jane Austen binge, because it gives more nuance than a list, as well as showing how characters might move throughout that kind of society.

This is a personal preference, but you should /never/ go for, 'well met Heir Potter', or anything of that ilk. I find it dumb. Good luck with your story.

*** The regency parallel would be really interesting! Like, what if the Weasleys are technically landed gentry, even if they're poor. That makes them of a higher social class than someone with a lot of new money that comes from trade. It would be cool to see something like... Blaise Zabini, whose mum inherits money from her dead husbands, scrabbling to get noticed by someone like Theodore Nott or Draco Malfoy. Maybe Blaise hates the Weasleys and antagonises them (think Miss Bingley to Lizzy Bennett) for having a status that he could never feasibly obtain.

**** Miss Bingley was jealous of the attention Darcy paid Elizabeth, but I see your point about behavior. Why do I know that? Because I memorized them. I think the Weasleys' history isn't really expanded upon enough. Because they're not that poor, but what if Muriel finagled her way into getting the rent from the lands. Because most of the landed gentry earned rent off of their lands. You could write a fic in which Ron and Ginny, realizing why the family estate went to Muriel, go to war with her to get it back.

** Altercations shouldn't resort to violence as a general rule, someone willing to come to blows with a housemate over a minor altercation would be persona non grata. There would be no "official" rules, if you need to ask what the rules are, you probably don't deserve to know.

For example, it's a trope for it to be an outlined rule to "Avoid confrontation between Slytherins outside the common room." Why would it be? Why is this an official rule? Slytherins are /not/ mistreated by the school. All the houses basically keep to themselves. There is no abuse from the school towards them.

The danger in Slytherin is the other Slytherins. Slytherins are the heirs to some of the most important people of the Wizarding World. They tend to be the only people you can't offend, especially if you're just as ambitious as they are.

** Remember that most of them are just normal teenagers and not pompous nobles. There will only ever be a few of those at a time. Your typical Slytherin is likely just some kid that either has well defined career goals or is predisposed to being a manipulative little shit. The nature of the Slytherin political scene will depend on the nature of the students you intend to feature.

You should consider each character's main secondary traits to keep them from all seeming like clones with superficial details changed around. Like, they have their goal, but how do they reach for it? Are they just a dreamer? Do they work hard for their goal? Do they rely on networking and family connections? Are they ethical or are they ruthless? Maybe they don't have a serious life goal and they main attribute is their cunning. What do they typically use that cunning for? Are they pranksters? Quidditch captain in the making? Are they the aforementioned manipulative little shit that has their parents wrapped around their finger?

Since they're teenagers, even if they try to politic because it's 'cool' they are probably going to be shit at it. Think of your typical high school cliques and turn it up to hollywood levels to account for the fact that these clique-formers have been concentrated in one place rather than spread throughout the school.

If you want to delve into nobles and stuff and turn Slytherin house into a mini-wizengamot debate club thing, you'll need to approach things differently. Figure out what the major issues of the time are. Remember that there are likely a wide range of potential subjects of debate besides the Voldemort vs Dumbeldore factions. People don't align neatly into simple good vs evil. Individual issues can have multiple valid solutions and character can agree on some things but disagree on others. You might want to put together some sort of chart to keep track of it all. Political ideology is ruddy complicated and that doesn't even begin to cover all the money, favor trading, and changing pressures of current events involved in actual politics.

When it comes to nobles and stuff like that, keep in mind that wizarding society /separated/ from muggle society in 1692. They weren't left behind. They simply developed on an independent tangent. Basing their traditions off of Regency era or Victorian culture would be totally inaccurate since those cultural waves occurred in the 1800's, well after separation. Wizarding society should be more like a lost overseas colony than a trip back in time. Thinking of them as muggles, but old-fashioned is a mistake. They should be developed, but having done so in their own unique way. Exactly what that way is is up to authorial creativity.

*** You're right about the separation, /but/ muggles went that way for a reason. Wizarding politics seem to resemble the muggle side despite Britains' government being a hodgepodge of convention slowly assembled into law well after 1692. The English government changed alongside its culture quite slowly. So they would most likely resemble muggle culture in some fashion. We can't just say they were separate for 3 hundred years so they're different now, because that is not what the canon shows.

So in that respect, you figured out what, by all rights, should be happening, not quite what is happening. JKR's world was not that well thought through, and culture is one of those things that was ignored.

Go further, houses have hobbies. Gryffindor throws parties, Slytherin has debates, Hufflepuff has military training. Ravenclaws bully other children.

I'd like to defend Regency, as the one who brought it up. (Again, Victorian can leave, for the reasons I briefly outlined in my original comment.) The Wizarding World should appear less like a lost colony, and more like a regular colony. They can still move about the muggle world, picking up ideas, and muggle-borns are continually coming into the Wizarding World. The idea that they'd be completely different isn't likely.

The regency era honestly has a lot in common with the Wizarding World. They have a similar pre-industrialization feel, just with quills instead of dip-pens. If we carry that over to their landed gentry, we'd probably end up with similar behaviours.

** It's school and they are dumb kids. If you want a gritty version then go the Victorian era court type of politics.

If you want the realistic version you should go with over the top Larping and bombastic stuff over petty useless issues that never escalate to violence. Since slytherin politics should be an easy mode tutorial with candy and rainbows version of real politics. Maybe they stop playing the game(because that's what it is) at around 7 year or so.

Remember also that ancient cultures like those in the 17th-18th century treated children and schools differently. They both babied them and coddled them over certain thing and where overly harsh about other nonsensical things.

** Most slythern au annoy me because IMO adolescence is already a very status conscious stage of life, slytherins would just be less likely to shy away from it. The most political things they'd do unless their families direct them to do something is try to make friends with those from rich/influential families or who are skilled at magic/school so that they can ask for favors.Basically a more pragmatic approach to friendship. But even Malfoy, the most pompous slytherin we see, doesn't go around saying"Well met, Heir xyz". I think a lot of the more stiff interpretations like tit for tat favors goes against what a self interested person would do.

** The first decision you have to make is what Slytherin House stands for. This can be the usual -- that is, conservative/traditional wizarding values, with in particular scepticism regarding Muggleborns (on the tame side) to outright blood-based racism and discrimination (on the extreme side) -- but that needn't be the case. You could imagine, for instance, a radical meritocracy; in a sense, Voldemort's quote about there being no good and evil, only power, turned into practical action. This would fit the stated (not the shown) traits of Slytherin -- the best Slytherin the strongest, most ambitious, most successful wizard or witch.

Of course, you can also combine the two. This is kind-of the approach I pursued in the Slytherin FF I am planning; the world, just like Voldemort noted, broadly splits into leaders and followers ("power and those to weak to seek it"), and since you have racists who look down (and given the chance, also attack/bully) e.g. halfbloods, the latter, in turn, band together and coalesce around a leader-type figure to counter the power of the former, who then themselves would form a more tightly-knit group.

So the end result is essentially different cliques; some sort of multipolar power distribution, keeping a balance within Slytherin House.

That's one dimension of this question. Another dimension is figuring out how much (or not) of a normal school house Slytherin is. I'm not strictly opposed to making 90% of all students there the equivalents of Mean Girls -- let's be honest, that is /not/ how (by conventional standards) normal, decent people behave -- /but/, I think you can argue that by virtue of the Hat's selection many of those that are predisposed to be selfish bitches and bastards without regard for others go there, and those that aren't, learn how to be in order to keep up. So you /can/ plausibly turn Slytherin into a cutthroat society where everyone fucks over everyone else in the name of winning and ambition -- but you needn't.

Aside from determining the atmosphere, this also affects the stability of the power distribution. The more you ramp up the backstabbing, the less stable it is.

.

And if you got those two dimensions figured out, you can derive from that the structure of Slytherin House, and the daily happenings. For instance, I'd argue that too much of radical self-centrism makes the "Slytherin Court" (a panel, officially or inofficially watching over and thus regulating the power struggles) impossible. On the other hand, introducing a lot of blood-racism /and/ halfbloods will lead to the differing coexisting cliques I noted above.

And if you ramp down both the blood-racism /and/ the mean-girls aspect, you end up with "just students who study magic".

Note that I don't think too much of the "they're just 11!" argument. There can be reasons to make Slytherin a House like any other, but that ain't one. For one, only 1/7 are 11 and they don't exist in a vacuum, and then, going back to the Hat, they can be plausibly argued to precisely be /not/ "just 11". What /is/ true is that their arguments would be parroted (from parents or older students) and their schemes (if they tried any) terrible. But that's a different argument from saying they absolutely must be like every other 11 year old.

** If we thinking about 16-18 crowd...I think Slytherins as a whole think a lot about their family rather than just themselves as an individual. So whether they go along with it or rebel they know in their head that their choices don't just reflect on them but also their family so they have to prepared for backlash. That will complicate all their choices from subjects they study, their career, maybe who they date.

They seem to be more political minded in that they know it's important to make nice in public and u can't always just say what u think in the moment. Things might need to be done behind closed doors.

More aloof and more hesitant to reveal all their weaknesses or true feelings in front of everyone but of course these are teens so they might not be as convincing of actors as they think.

Would be juggling in their head family dynamics and networking and strategizing

Prob party hard behind closed doors but don't want any photo evidence in case of blackmail

They prob feel like they have to vet ppl before they trust them

Prob have some families in the sacred 28 who hate each other and have been fueding for generations because of a falling out between great grandfathers so they wouldn't want the current kids mingling

Some of the families prob try to arrange marriages to secure money/land/etc

At least some of the kids would be expected to join family business, take over certain positions once they graduate

** I'm planning to have a whole "currency" based on favours. Like, say A does an essay for B, then B either has to do an essay for A or they owe them a favour of equal value. This could also tie in with gaining political allies. I'm basically having most Slytherins behaving as if Hogwarts is a place to gain allies since most of the wealthy students are in Slytherin and they can afford private tutors, which was probably what they did before their children went to Hogwarts. So, they'll form friend groups with other students who are politically the strongest (such as Draco Malfoy, whose father has the Minister's ear).

I wasn't planning on doing an official monarch, either, but rather a Court and its leader. So, a group of students who hold power in the house. They set the "rules" so to speak. Like, say the leader of the Court wants to stop the other Houses from thinking Slytherins are evil; they'll make a rule suggesting that Slytherins keep taunting and bullying to a minimum. The leader is someone who the other people in the House look up to; the leader is there to better the House.

You want to be a powerful person in Slytherin and try to gain allies? Make yourself powerful and useful; meaning, get really good at this one subject so you'll be of use for others, or become good at other things, perhaps at acquiring shady objects.

The leader of the Court is pretty much the Monarch. You want to be the leader of Slytherin? Then you've got to take them down. Either through underhanded methods such as ruining their credibility, or by publicly (amongst the rest of the House) humiliating or beating them in a verbal duel.

- there is a 'head' of slytherin, but the position is always up for grabs
