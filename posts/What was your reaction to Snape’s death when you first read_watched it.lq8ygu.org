**** I never liked snape, and i feel the justification for him was lame at best. Got a family member that liked to wreck people verbally (majorly into emotional/verbal abuse) etc., so reading him made me pretty poed, in large part because I recognize what is going on. Being bitter, resentful, and hateful to the world around you so you create more pain and misery to feel vindicated, powerful, or not alone. And IF one is ever called out on it... Always the victim.

That kind of man is why there are review boards.

Alan Rickman did him FAR too much justice, but that's what you get when you put a high class actor and let him create a presence.

The ending he got was what he deserved, a betrayal from Dumbledore and Riddle, from his own machinations.

Knowing the lore of the wand, it's pretty obvious ya know? Especially when riddle spells it out. Dumbledore set him up to die.

That was the dynamic I felt between Dumbledore and Shape.

Dumbledore would have loved nothing more than to be a school teacher. He took on the other responsibilities due to feeling no one else would do it the way he felt best, but he always seemed too take delight in teaching.

Snape should have been a private researcher. I've known plenty of people that take joy in their craft but explaining it to another that isn't knowledgeable would be life draining.

Now we realize what a flawed character Albus is but so does Harry realize at the same time. Harry still decides to sacrifice himself. But he does it with full knowledge that he has been played. And that's why the walk to the forest is so heartbreaking.

Protecting Draco while putting the rest of the school in danger up to the point where two other students almost died and one was put under an unforgivable, losing Remus his job and Sirius his freedom even though he knew they were innocent, the regular abuse he puts his students through, waiting just long enough in calling the order that by the time they get there the DA was already fighting death eaters thus heightening the chances of Sirius dying, becoming a member of a group that boils down to an alternative KKK... forget the kiss, by the time he finally kicked the bucket he was deserving of the fate of Allice and Frank Longbotton, even disregarding the whole prophecy thing even though he knew he would be condemning a /baby/ and their parents to almost certain death by telling it to Voldemort even if he didn't know who exactly would become a target.

****** I think he deserved to die in /even worse ways/. The curse that killed Dumbledore looked to be painful enough; or maybe having his soul eaten by a dementor, if he stays conscious through eternity while suffering an even more intense version of their aura since he will be inside them instead of just near while drowning on the combined suffering of millions of other souls than it could be enough, an “I have no mouth and must scream” type of fate you know; or maybe he could end like my head-cannon of what happened to Regulus, not only having drank the torture poison, but also dragged to the bottom of the fake lake by the inferi with curses to keep him conscious and aware the whole time but incapable of moving as his body slowly weaken and die; then there is always good and tried insanity, the Longbottom or Lockhart fate both are adequately terrible; alternatively maybe just an good and old ostracism, having everyone regarding him as being below even a beast, unworthy of any right or consideration or even the dignity of dying by a hand that is not his own, condemned to walk aimlessly through the world but treated as if he never existed: no one is willing to interact with him, has no propriety or possessions of his own, has his name and history erased of all documents or historical accounts, can't ask for legal protection but has very painful consequences if he violates the rights of anyone else...

So yeah, really hate the guy. Nagini killing him was good in the sense that it showed complete and utter disregard for his self, Voldemort couldn't even be bothered to kill him personally, all his years of services ignored without a second thought over a mere supposition that ended up amounting to nothing - it has a certain appeal in it's casual cruelty, though not nearly as painful as he deserves.

******** That Voldemort did what he did not out of rage or a great need or anything of the sort, he merely killed him because Snape was on the way and he couldn't be bothered to try finding a way of keeping him alive. To have spend years slaving away -however reluctantly- at the whims of someone, taking all the pain and abuse while giving his all, only to be casually thrown aside because it just happened to be the easiest path... it is a bit like having someone break your legs for your place on the line to buy some cookies, it could have been something that caused greater suffering instead, but the sense that the other person considers you merely ground under their feet, it can't be at all pleasant.

************ Kind of? My guess is that Dumbledore genuinely wanted to end the war with the least amount of suffering and death he could. Snape helped him on that and he acknowledged and saw him as an ally, so he wouldn't simply backstab him or use him for his own ends and then let him fend for himself with no clue of what is happening. At the same time they were fighting a war, he knew that each time he sent a member of the order on a mission there was a good chance that he was sending them to their deaths, and of all the members Snape was the one who joined up with Voldemort and only changed sides when his own selfish he interests were threatened, he was the one who willingly told Voldemort that he would need to kill an innocent baby or he would be defeated (Voldemort had no way of even knowing that Dumbledore was conducting a job interview for the Divination post at the Hogsheads, to say nothing of knowing that anything of note was going to happen there, Snape could have easily just not told him without any reprisal) and then only regretted that it put the woman he was obsessed with in danger, and he was the one who antagonized everyone else every chance he got. He would prefer that Snape didn't suffer or die, but of all the order members Snape was just the easiest one to justify sending on almost suicidal missions or having take the fall to protect others.

************** Not necessarily, until DH we have no conclusive reason to believe Voldemort was interested or even believed in the Elder Wand. Olivanders was taken mostly for him to figure out how to sidestep the /prior incantatem/, and if the subject ever showed up during their talks it is unlikely that anyone listening cared enough to pass it forward when there was so much more important things to speak about.

And even /if/ Dumbledore somehow figured out that Voldemort would go after the wand eventually it really wouldn't be so clear-cut as him just up and deciding Snape should die. He was working on the supposition that since he had chosen to die instead of being forced he would die undefeated, but assuming that he took measures in case he was wrong and the wand just decided to give it's loyalty to someone else... well, Snape quite spontaneously made an unbreakable oath to kill him in case Malfoy failed, having anyone in the order disarm him not only could potentially not work but he would also be giving the wand to people who were actively entering duels and thus with reasonable chances of being disarmed /and/ either outright letting the information about the wand slip to potentially get to Voldemort or give enough clues that he could very well just outright send Voldemort a letter taunting him about how his wand is especial and powerful that it would be more likely to conceal the truth; Harry and Co would be in the same boat with the additional risk of Voldemort reading Harry's mind. In the end he would have to either find a way of getting the wand to the hands of someone who would be away from the war and unlikely to misuse it (so an innocent first year in another country who would then be at risk) or pass the wand to Snape who is far less innocent, took willingly the risk of dying and had a readily made excuse for killing/disarming him that would stand not only to Voldemort's scrutiny, but also his own to the point of potentially never even figuring out he had the wand and thus incapable of accidentally letting it slip to Voldemort... it really, /really/ wouldn't be that hard of a choice, unpleasant yes, but much less so than putting an unwitting innocent in danger.

** I was so mad. So. Mad. Snape was my favorite character since I read book 1 when I was 9. At first I just thought him funny but as i grew older and waited for the next book to be released that grew to I always knew there was a story behind him, and I understood him. I have felt that kind of hatred, resentment and bitterness before. At times it was hard for me to look at/read and remember that was me. I HATED the backstory he was given with Lily. H a t e d it. Anything else would have been better. So I was annoyed with that. I didnt like him because I thought he was a good person, or that his actions were just or that he redeemed himself. I just saw my own pain in him and understood how he turned out. I related to him, his childhood etc.

It also did not help that every character that has been my favorite since i was 5 and saw the Lion King has died. I thought well Snape has made it to the end of the last book, finally, FINALLY, the favorite character curse is broken. Then like a few chapters from the end he dies. I was so livid i got the book at midnight and read all night and then i quite literally threw the book across the room when he died and didnt pick it up to actually finish it until 3 weeks later.

In the end though it was the only way to truly, properly bring his story to an end. Sighhh, still to this day every favorite character has died, I have now forced myself not to have one.

Sad because he deserves to live without two masters pushing & pulling him. He was also too young to die, like many other characters and he deserves to heal and may be find love? I think Severus & then Sirius had the most tragic deaths.

It made sense because a spy rarely survives, also he's been working for this for the past 17 years. In a twisted kind of way, he's done his job so well and he finds peace in death only.
