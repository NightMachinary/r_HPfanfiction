Like what the title suggests, what are some of the inventions/objects that were created and accepted as fanon? I know there are fanon spells like Tempus and such but I am interested in any creations accepted as fanfiction norm.

Thanks in advance.


** Some fanon inventions are preferable to me than canon:

- Ancient Runes is needed for enchanting items
- Arithmancy is needed for developing spells
- "Ward" sounds way better than "Magical Protection", and simpler
- Tempus and Warming Charms exist
- Lucius Malfoy should be in the Wizengamot
- Lily used blood magic to protect Harry. As long as Voldemort killed her, the sacrificial protection would be activated. It didn't matter whether Voldemort offered her a choice or not. I actually dislike this part, because it's just another one of long chain of lucky events that brought down Voldemort. Why can't good guys be proactive and ruthless at least for once?
- There is no Time Turner. Most fics featuring time turners either get abandoned in an overcomplicated mess, or rehash that frustrating timeline. Also, no time turners => No Cursed Child!

*** You can argue that you can enchant winter clothes or whatnot with Hot-Air Charms which are canon.

**** The 'mansion trunk' where inexplicably Lord Harry goes on his traditional post-gringotts shopping spree to spend millions of galleons on things which will never appear in the story again and gets a magically expanded trunk with a full-sized mansion (including plumbing, functional kitchens, and often greenhouses) inside.

Of course, Fantastic Beasts made that Canon, but fanon had it first, damn it!

***** Didn't they find the real Mad-Eye living in his trunk in the Goblet of Fire? I thought that's where the idea came from

****** I don't think the books really specified how much room was in there, just that he had a key for each compartment. I think the implication was supposed to be that you had one, I dunno, 4 ft by 4 ft by 6 ft trunk with 7x separate 4 ft by 4 ft by 6 ft sections, and moody was stashed in one of them.

The movie made it a pit, which is still a pretty far cry from the pocket dimensions from fanon.

******* I don't have the book handy but I'm pretty sure GoF intimated Moody was in some kind of cavern/room. Doesn't Dumbledore go down into the trunk to get him out?

****** Mad-Eye wasn't exactly /living/ in his trunk. He managed to survive being /kept/ in it.

And the seventh compartment is ten feet deep and large enough to fit both Dumbledore and an unconscious Moody in it but other than that it's basically a cell which presumably held enough oxygen to stop Moody from dying when Crouch locked him in there for long periods.

***** The Undetectable Expansion charm was around in Harry Potter since book 2. It's first applied on Mr. Weasley's car to expand the trunk and the seats. Then it appears again on Moody's trunk, then on Hermione's beaded handbag. I think it all comes down to how much you want to expand a certain space.

***** I remember that now. The trunk was very common in most fanfics. Thanks!

I'm currently editing these out of my fic, because for some reason I thought it was canon. ðŸ™„

*** You can always use partial human transfiguration instead (like for Ron in DH)- it's entirely canon, and takes longer to apply, but is permanent until removed.

*** You are writing fanfiction, are you not? You'll have to delete the story to edit out everything that isn't canon. This comment doesn't make sense to me.
