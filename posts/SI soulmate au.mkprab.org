im looking for a fic where its a soulmate au - the kind of soulmate au where they share information in some way - and its between someone in the canonverse and someone who has read the hp books or seen the movies. i just feel like that would be really interesting but i dont know what to look up to find it.


** Or more broadly wizard/Muggle soul-bond? That's an interesting idea.

** linkao3(Rose Petal Red by NonchalantxFish) - main character is a self-insert into Ginny's twin sister. The shared information bond occurs later on with Sirius, in an entirely non-sexual context so it's not quite a soul-mate thing.

  “What's best for me and mine, and what's fair for everyone else.” The father of my second life told me to keep those words close. Even back in my first one, I'd been a zero or one hundred kinda girl --- those words defined my life, this time around. Probably for the best, really. My father's name was Arthur Weasley, and I was born in a universe where the Boy Who Lived wasn't guaranteed to win. Looks like I had to pick up the slack, yeah?
