  she never refers to him as "Potter" like Snape or Malfoy does
#+end_quote

This is very incorrect. She calls him 'Potter' more than anything else

**** I know she used both. Mr. Potter was usually when she was being polite to him, or he hadn't done anything wrong. She called him just Potter when he was in trouble. I think also sometimes when she was angry at someone else and he just happened to be there.
