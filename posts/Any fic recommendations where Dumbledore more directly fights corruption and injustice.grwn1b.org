Of course he does so in canon by helping Sirius escape and restarting the Order but in a world where Fudge is the Minister and has Lucius whispering in his ear it really seems like he should have done more to sort out the Ministry after Voldemort fell.

Just in Chamber you have things like Hagrid being arrested for no reason while Dumbledore watches, then at the end of the year Lucius walks away Scott free after being directly responsible for unleashing a weapon of mass destruction in a school.

Third year has the extremely messy handling of Sirius' capture.

Goblet has the obvious issue of ignoring Voldemort's return and the often ignored summary execution of Crouch Junior. Fudge allowed the execution of a man with vital information in the most horrific way without any kind of trial or over sight.

In Order we had the slandering of a teenager by both the press and government. And also there's the minor matter of letting a tyrant into his school who literally tortures and mutilates children.

I know in a decent amount of fics Harry goes to someone like Amelia Bones and within a few chapters everything is sorted out but I'm more looking for fics where legal system still sucks but Albus decides to take the law into his own hand.

Maybe he can't legally prove Lucius was responsible for the diary but they both know and Dumbledore doesn't let him off with a mild scolding, instead deciding to ruin him politically and financially for daring to put the students under his care in danger.

Well, in this fic, after Harry makes him an offer he can't refuse, Dumbledore pretty much destroys Voldemort and his Death Eaters single handedly :) But I doubt this is the sort of story you're looking for.

  The events at the end of the Triwizard Tournament have left Harry feeling just a little bit paranoid.
