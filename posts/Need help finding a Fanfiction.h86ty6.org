So story is like, Draco likes harry but Harry doesn't know. One day Harry confronts Draco for something else in the corridor and Draco gets hard and Harry feels disgusted (I think) and then he goes into Draco's Slytherin room and there Draco, Pansy and Blaise was drinking firewhisky. So Pansy I think, asks Draco like is he gay for all boys or just Harry, and then Draco and Blaise kiss to find out and turns out he is gay for perfect potter. And then Draco gets all cute and says he loves Harry and he even writes a list of things he needs to do to win Harry. Which invisible Harry finds him writing. And it's like, don't call Ginny she weasel and don't make fun of Ron or be nice to Hermione and everyone, don't bully first years and all. And harry waits to see if he follows through. And also harry accidentally falls asleep in Draco's room that night and has to run back to Gryffindor the next morning.
