I feel like so many fics just have Harry with a superpower, or an entirely different character, or just a hugely different change, but ends up somehow with Harry down the trapdoor facing Quirrell, or a basilisk or a dragon. With a divergence, shouldn't everything be different?


** It depends on how it's done. I don't mind canon rehashes if it's a character-driven story. For eg: The Changeling by Annerb is pretty much a canon rehash but I'm not reading that story for plot, but because it's interesting to see how a Slytherin Ginny might view canonical events differently and as an exploration of her character.

But like you said, if you're writing a plot-driven story and you've gone out of your way to create a major divergence, it doesn't make sense to keep things canon. This is especially true for time-travel. It's extremely annoying to read a time-travel story where the protagonist wants "preserve the time-line" and "not change things too much" etc. What's even the point of going back then? It feels contrived and unoriginal.

*** While it is almost entirely canon plot compliant, I never thought of the changeling as a canon rehash. Those are the fics that shove the main character in all the major canon stations with scenes playing out the same way with exact same dialogue with no almost no difference from the books.

One thing I liked about it is that it doesn't get Ginny involved in a lot of important scenes and just mentions them in passing or has her act as an observer. It mostly seems to be about her life and her struggles rather than defeating various Voldemort enemies/challenges. Troll, quirell, etc. scenes are completely skipped over only getting a few sentences of how she heard about Harry doing something. For me, the changeling has always been an example of how to do a fic that follows canon without it being a canon rehash.

**** I think they're pretty much the same thing to be honest, except an example of canon-compliant might be a story of Neville's POV of Year 7. Same events, different perspective but no new additions.

To me a canon rehash is when you introduce a major change in the storyline (slytherin ginny) but that change doesn't influence the overall plot and you still stop at canon stations despite the fact that you might take a different route to get there. Like I said, this works in The Changeling because it's character-driven. Ginny being in Slytherin will mostly affect her but it doesn't have to affect the overall plot. It's about Ginny growing and developing as a character and the effects it has on Slytherin house, but major plot-points like getting with Harry in sixth year, Sirus, Dumbledore, Snape, Remus etc all dying don't change. In that sense it is a canon rehash. It's not a bad thing and some of my favourite fics are rehashes. But when your story is dependent on the plot and you've tried to derail it, like a time-travel story, it doesn't make sense to come back to the canon storyline.

** It Doesn't really bother me just it bores me most of the time. I understand that somethings are ought to happen because the Harry might not have imput in them. Like a Harry dating Ginny since before the yule ball won't change the tasks. So I allow it in the very first chapters.

But later the butterfies (as the unexpected and usually unpredictable changes in the timeline that are caused by the divergence; as we call them in alternatehistory.com) should make the plans of Voldemort and other people change, so perhaps he wouldn't want to steal the prophecy or might look for the elder wand earlier or something like that.

So, while canon consistency is necessary at the beginning, after some time the story must change and it shouldn't be canon rehearsal

** It's not that annoying to me, it just gets really old having to read a lot of fics relying on the very same conflicts the Canon posed. We all know by now that Moody is a fake in 4th year, the tasks are no longer a surprise, we've suffered through Dolores and Fudge's persecution already in 5th year. I really love it when the author adds different tasks in the tournament, like in "The Lie I've Lived".

What I don't like is when the author dumps long passages straight from Canon into the fic when they decide events are going to be the same anyway.

** When something ends up being the same after a big difference, you have to ask a couple of questions: how much impact on events did the big difference have, and which events are too solidly set in stone to be affected by anything?

Take a Slytherin Hermione story for example (I've only read a couple of them, so this is an example only); even if Harry and Ron don't become friends with Hermione because of house separation, Harry and Ron at least would have ended up in the 3rd Floor Corridor contraption (in some stories it's Neville that goes with them, sometimes it's somebody else). In most stories, what's to actually stop the basilisk from being released? So the question becomes what the big difference is and how it should logically affect the RESPONSE to the Basilisk release. In Applied Anthropology, it's Hermione who gets ahold of Riddle's Diary, who then gives it to Neville, and Neville becomes the "heir of Slytherin" instead of Ginny. But it was still logical for Harry to end up down there in the Chamber of Secrets, but it was also logical for Hermione to be there with him instead of Ron. Sometimes people change things wildly because they're not interested in being even semi cannon compliant, other times things include certain events because they are looking for it to semi follow cannon. There can be lots of reasons things do or don't stay the same.

However, sometimes things following along just so with very few differences when there should be is just lazy writing, but I've always found those times easy to spot with a little writing analysis.

** Some events are going to be the same regardless. Like in my fic I'm working on, Sirius escapes a year earlier and Dumbledore wants to hire Remus then, because everyone thinks he killed Pettigrew just for kicks, so Dumbledore thinks Remus might be in danger and wants him safe at Hogwarts until Sirius is caught.

So I guess... it makes sense for certain events to trigger other events, even if the timeline has changed.

In the case of hiring Remus, I tend to think that Dumbledore hired him when Sirius escaped because he'd be the best person to defend Harry against him; it wasn't to protect Remus so much as to have Remus protect Harry.

Similarly, the TriWizard Tournament could be a consequence of the growing threat of Riddle's return- more than a publicity stunt, it was a chance for Albus to assess possible allies in Europe as the Dark Lord's return became more likely.
