Are there any fics where (either because of the killing curse or the Deathly Hallows) Harry sees and regularly communicates with the dead?

I don't really care if its post-war or Hogwarts period (although it would be cool to see what affect it would have on Harry to have his spectral parents around his whole life)

Gen fic preferred, but het and slash are cool too. No harem fic though please.


** Kind of cliche sometimes and is probably dead now but- linkffn(A bitter hug of Mortality).

**** I, personally, liked it even though it was kind of cliche at times. But I have it on a subscription list and since then it hasn't been updated at all. I feel like the author has kind of forgotten it.

The magic is kind of unique though. Great world building.

  Harry is the younger brother of the Boy Who Lived and is a little strange. He hears voices no one else can hear, he knows things no one else should know and he's just this side of crazy. Oh, and everyone thinks he's a squib. When it comes to Harry, however, all bets are off and nothing is entirely certain.

** You might like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12869153/1/Resurrect-The-Living][Resurrect the Living]]. It's a relatively new fic (first published 4 months ago, 15 chapters so far and ongoing).

After the war, Harry begins to see dead people everywhere (a la /The Sixth Sense/.) He tries to ignore the problem, but over time the violently dead seem to be more and more drawn to his presence. Turns out being "Master" of the Hallows is more of a curse than anything. With the help of his friends Harry searches for a solution, but he can't help feeling that time is running out.

** Whispers in corners is a sherlock/harry potter crossover that has Harry talking with the dead quite alot. I read it on archives of our own and I thought it was a good read anyway.

** Life After Death by Aelys_Althea on Ao3 is just a gorgeous Drarry fic. Harry deals with--and attempts to help--ghosts throughout the tale, while coming to terms with his own death experience . . . and the very-much-alive but also damaged Draco Malfoy.
