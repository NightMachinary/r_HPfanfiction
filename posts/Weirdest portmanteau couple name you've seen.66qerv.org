So Ive seen Harmony and Bellamione and Honks, but what's the strangest couple name you've seen? In all fan fiction, not just Harry Potter.

***** I know :) When browsing through things on Mobile (where it's hard to filter out things like crossovers), sometimes it's hard to notice little things when scrolling. That and some people have typos in their tags.

You try and filter out crossovers and somehow still get Marvel ships, try searching by ship name and /still/ somehow get Marvel things... Lol. All to try and find something that was tagged instead of using the pairing designator, because for some reason some people don't use both.

*** The Matt/Foggy one is an inside joke - they run a law firm, and "avocado" is a mispronunciation of the Spanish word for attorney, "abogado."

I like American Airlines/Freebird (Sam/Steve) and WinterWidow (Bucky/Natasha).

There's an artist who did cute [[https://www.dailydot.com/parsec/avengers-ship-names-fanart/][illustrations]] of Marvel pairing names.

** Two of my favourite ships happen to be Scriddler and Hattercrow, which are pretty odd names for ships. 50 house points if you can guess who they are (hint: there's only 3 people involved). Hivy is also a pretty odd name, since it reminds me of hives. As in, what you get on your body or a house for bees.

There's also Dratchet, Megascream, and Cygate, which sounds like an American political scandal but is actually a pair of gay robots.

EDIT: Also, making wait 4 minutes between comments is the worst.
