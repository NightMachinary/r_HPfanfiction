Ideally Snape would remain the same bitter & hateful creature he is, seeking only to protect the standing of his house and indebting the Malfoy family to him.

Draco would be forced/trained into actually displaying Slytherin qualities whilst continuing to be the bigot he is was raised to be.

  "Enemies of the Heir Beware! You're next, Mudbl--" aaaaand Draco gets hauled off by his ear, yet again. Dil tells him off, yet again. Dil writes to his mother, yet again. Dear Mrs. Malfoy, I regret to inform you that your son is attempting to fuel rumors implicating himself and your family in homicidal threats, Regards, Dilwyn Greengrass.

So the above story doesn't fit your request, because Dilwyn is a decent person trying to make Draco a decent person. But I included the quote because I love the Slytherinness of it. He's not saying "death threats are morally wrong", he's saying "death threats are unsubtle and tactically /stupid/, try thinking before you open your mouth".

Would love to read a Snape & Draco story about how very UNcunning it is to steal Remembralls in front of the entire Great Hall, or yell death threats in front of (presumed) killed pets, or call Hermione a racial slur in front of the entire Gryffindor Quidditch team. Actually, that reminds me of another story.

  “You know that I have banned that word in the Slytherin common room - and I have done so for a reason.” Multiple, in fact, but the personal ones were not relevant. “Mr Weasley and yourself lost the same number of points today because the majority of this school would consider his reaction ‘fair'.” He held up a hand to forestall Draco's objections. “I am not commenting on whether or not his reaction was fair - I am speaking of how it will be perceived. To many, you were responsible for escalating the conflict, and Mr Weasley was the chivalrous Gryffindor by drawing his wand. Is that what you wished to achieve?”

  “...no,” Draco said sulkily.

  “As an insult, ‘mudblood' is both lazy and politically inept,” Severus told him. “It makes you more enemies than allies, and gives your target the privileged position of a victim. Furthermore, if the only thing about your target you can insult is their ancestry, you are unlikely to persuade anyone. Do you understand?”

Again, this is a story where a decent person is trying to teach Draco to be a decent person, so it doesn't answer your request. But this specific passage reminded me of how unSlytherin Draco is.

Oh well, he's at Hogwarts to learn, after all.

  Severus Snape is committed to the welfare of his students, and providing them with a quality education. And since Dumbledore isn't providing them with the resources he needs, he's turning to other allies for assistance.An exploration of what COULD have happened in Harry's second year.

** You know what else is funny? The Sorting Hat sends him to Slytherin almost instantly upon touching his hair. No conversation, no deliberation, just screaming out its first impression of him.

So, the Sorting Hat is highly prejudiced. (Literally, pre-judging, making a decision before properly weighing the evidence.)

*** My personal headcannon is that the Sorting Hat doesn't send you where you belong, but rather where you think you belong. For some people, like Harry and Hermione, who aren't really sure, it sorts through their abilities and personalities before discussing with them the benefits of each house and how the houses relate to them. But for others, like Draco and Ron, there isn't really any deliberation. Draco knows he's going to Slytherin; he's a /Malfoy./ And everyone knows that Weasley's always go to Gryffindor, even though its highly unlikely that every Weasley child for the last 7 generations or whatever has had bravery as their primary personality component.

Its also why Neville goes to Gryffindor. He's not particularly brave. Sure, he has his moments, but he spends a lot of time, especially early on, being pretty cowardly. But Augusta spends so much time talking up his parents and telling him how much she hopes he's like them and all that, and so when Neville gets to the Hat he may not be sure that he belongs in Gryffindor, but he's damn sure that the other three aren't options.

***** I'd say a large part of it is his grandma telling him that if he got in anything apart from Gryffindor, his dad would be disappointed in him. Apart from the fact that it is emotional abuse, it implies that his dad's condition might get worse due to Neville getting, say, the house of the loyal and hardworking.
