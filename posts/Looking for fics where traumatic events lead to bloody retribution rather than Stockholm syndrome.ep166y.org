So I took a dive into the abyss of Ao3 in the hope of finding a story where Harry or Hermione suffered through something horrible (slavery, rape, you get the picture) and then go on a quest for vengeance. Unfortunately, all I found were horrible set-ups for romance where the canon Bellatrix torture scene was the least disturbing one. The less said about Goblin slavery the better.

So does anyone know a good fic where Harry or Hermione go through a traumatic event and rather than falling in love with their tormentor or becoming an emotional wreck, they swear ruthless vengeance and carry it out? I'm not looking for stories where they become indiscriminately evil but rather aimed at a certain group. Their actions should be targeted against those who wronged them or people connected to them (eg Lucius having Draco's head delivered to him, Bellatrix finding her husband dead, basically what a scary Godfather would do). And the wronged person should be leading those actions rather than being avenged by others.

Preferably no bashing of third parties (the Weasleys, Dumbledore), no m/m.


** Arguably these would qualify:

- linkffn(The Lies That Bind by Zephoros): the first 1-2 chapters will seem generic - that is intentional. It rapidly takes a 180 after that and turns into something brutal in nature.
- linkffn(The Prisoner's Cipher): Harry did not go over well from the way the war went down. Much of the story is built around the mystery of why Harry is so messed up.
- linkffn(The Weapon Revised by GwendolynnFiction): Harry took a very different view on how to deal with the prophecy and Voldemort here. Its arguably the most realistic version of what "Harry trains to become super-powerful" would look like, trauma and all.

** I know there's a couple of Robst ones with basically this premise. Lots of 'The Weasleys/Dumbledore/whoever else does a terrible thing in the present and they go back in time and kill them all' themes. I recall one where they fed Percy to Fluffy early on.

There are a few others, but I'm writing this comment as a reminder to find the links later when I have the time.

**** Agreed. I'm not sure enough about Ginny myself to say either way, but in my view Ron was always too... dopey and ineffectual to carry out their dastardly plots of fanon tropes.

Most of the ones I know that were good were mentioned by Xesh, but I've a few others around.

I don't know if this one is good, since it's still on the list to read, but it's at least revenge on the Dursleys for standard fanon-upped trauma. linkffn(7487177)

There's one I still can't find because it was a little too dark and depressing for my taste and I've put the link in some deep, dark bookmark folder somewhere. It involved Harry being kidnapped by Voldemort in 1981 and raised/tortured for most of his youth until he was quite mad and, upon his escape, he returned the favor with gusto. I'll keep looking, but you'll be more likely to get it if someone else knows it. It's somewhat along the lines of Harry Potter and the Hero's Path, if that helps at all.

linkffn(2869936)

There's a pair of these that're essentially the same idea. Harry has trauma in the future and goes to the past to become magical John Wick while targeting Death Eaters. One of the two has him being rather enthusiastic about revenge specifically on the people who hurt Hermione in the future (incl. the guy in the Ministry fight who cursed her).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion]]

I'm not sure if the Denarian Renegade really counts myself, but I asked a friend and they're more into HP than I am and claimed it was, so... eh.

linkffn(3473224)

Finally, I don't know what your opinion on the trope-filled-and-bordering-on-cliche Azkaban fics are given how often the people you mentioned in your OP are bashed, but here's a couple of threads of 'Betrayed and Revenged' Harry fics that are mostly along those lines.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6wkd18/lf_betrayed_harry_fiction/]]

I asked that friend if this counted as well, they said it didn't while I said it did. It's essentially Hermione going all Dexter-esque on people who hurt her, but in a very Dread Pirate Roberts-Westley sort of way where she goes and prepares for ten years before doing anything.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/681510]]

And finally, one I personally wasn't a fan of, but counts for your prompt/request, so here it is.

An Influenced Ron? He most definitely could. EVERYTHING he believes (Slytherin bad, Dumbledore Good, Gryffindor Good), his mother or someone he trusted told him. Tweak Molly a bit, and there you go. A lot of the Weasley bashing fics have it right with Molly though. Look at book 5, most people would have booted her out for even a quarter of the stuff she pulled at the Order.

That's where a lot of the Ron bashing fics get it wrong. Ron needs outside influence to pull any of the nasty stuff.
