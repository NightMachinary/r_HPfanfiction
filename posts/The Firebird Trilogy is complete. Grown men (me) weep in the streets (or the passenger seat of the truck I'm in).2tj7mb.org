** I'm sad to see it go, but goodness gracious am I happy too. It was too dark for so long, I only wish we could see more of the goodness after so much depressing happenings

** That ending was perfect. Not too happy but not outright depressing. A very fitting end. This was one of the first fics I properly followed reading every update week by week and it was absolutely wonderful.

The world that DarthMarrs created was fantastic and it is the only harem fic i've ever read that was actually enjoyable on all levels.

*** [[/spoiler][As a dihard hhr fan, the last line about Hermione was a punch to the gut. Ginny's fate sucked too but was honestly kinda expected.]]

You're totally right that it was fitting though.

**** I know, I felt the same way about Hermione and Harry being split up, it almost felt wrong.

***** just the fact that it was so sudden and complete is like physically painful to me. I've lost loved ones before but I guess I just can't imagine never again thinking about or knowing about how my friends, even from years ago, or my family, let alone one I'd been through so much with, are doing. I +probably+ definitely got way too attached to the characters. Of all possible endings, that is by far the worst. It's just too real, too closer to something that could actually happen.

****** I wonder if any sociologists have ever done a study on people's preference for sad/happy endings vs their age.

Once out of my teens, sad endings got less and less interesting for me as they tend to blend in so well with the very reality one is usually trying to escape when picking up the book in the first place.

** /Sigh/, it's a great series but I'd have to re-read it all over again to remember exactly what's going on. I think I abandoned it after book 2.

*** I feel much the same, stopping in book 3 a few chapters in; I can take the grimdark, but have trouble maintaining excitement when it's chapter-a-week, with dreary sections feeling so much more so because they're drawn out over spans of months. Now that it's complete, I'll go back and finish the series.

DM riffed off one of my story starts once awhile back (/Unspeakable Things/, inspired by my one-shot /Detention in Defense/) and while I agree his writing isn't Hemingway, I still find his stories worth following. I also think that despite its flaws, Firebird was probably his best work to date.

** I loved the first part, but honestly, I only continued reading because the first part was that good. After Harry gets bonded, the story sorta goes meh for me. I feel like the author got overwhelmed by the scope of his own world and the changes he wanted to make, that the story quality suffered in the later 2 parts.

** It's finished? OMG. I need to hop on that fic and give it a read! I stopped following it a while ago because my interest just waned, but now that it's finished I'll have to give it a go.

** This was one of the darkest aka. most "realistic" approaches to magical warfare I've ever read.

I'm glad I read it.
