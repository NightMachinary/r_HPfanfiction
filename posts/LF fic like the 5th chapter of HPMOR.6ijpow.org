You know, the scene with Draco in Madam Malkin's. I haven't to this day laughed quite so hard at fic as I did reading that, and I've read Seventh Horcrux and Harry the Hufflepuff and The Black Comedy.

I can't really pinpoint why this scene in particular slayed me, but if you guys have any suggestions for stories with similar scenarios, I'd appreciate it.


** Yes, I'd quite like to know this as well; that scene made me cry laughing
