** Here's some advice, if that's what you're asking for:

- Use " instead of ' for dialogue.
- Learn when to use punctuation.
- I have no idea what the fic is going to offer(in general terms) from the first chapter, and the reader should know if you want people to read it. Ending in a cliffhanger is not enough, and the first chapter amounts to "Voldemort keeps sending Harry dreams after OotP and Ron falls off a broom after something weird happens", which doesn't sounds too promising. Your summary doesn't help much either.

*** Single quotes are standard British English.

*** Just as a point. I believe both ' and " are acceptable. ' is used in the British Harry Potter books and my creative writing lecturer said that ' tends to be the British way for dialogue

** I would still go with " for dialogue quotations. The reading is better with the double quotes. Pains me to say it, but some grammar work is needed. Punctuation is on the top of the list in regards to dialogue. To echo what Makinporing said, you need to come out of that first chapter with an objective. Starting in media res is confusing enough. Ending it without a definitive concluding thought makes for a jumbled read.
