Good, kinda rare re-do fics are what I'm looking for, would like a pairing. Don't care what as long as it's not slash

Thank you


** I found Dodging Prison And Stealing Witches pretty great despite the whole harem thing, but it isn't for everyone. Something that definitely speaks in favour of the author is the fact that they rather consistently update.

There is of course the Fear The Reaper challenge fics, but they almost always have ludicrous amounts of bashing.

Sadly, most fics of this nature are either written off or just.. not fun to read due to excessive bashing, or overpowered travellers.

*** Tempest Of The Fae and The Vanishing Cabinet Of Time for example, were fun to read but haven't been updated in three years and five years respectively.

** linkffn(Faery Heroes) does have its share of bashing, but it's primarily a humor fic (and a good one at that).

linkffn(Reboot by Kallanit) and linkffn(Harry Potter and the Last Chance by LeQuin) are more solid answers to the "Don't Fear the Reaper" challenge.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but the story did cry out for some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. Pre Cursed Child & Fantastic Beasts. COMPLETE.
