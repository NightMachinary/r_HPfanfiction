:END:
I'm looking for a fanfic story where Harry is bitten by a vampire in the forbidden forest. Dumbledore intervenes before Harry can be turned fully and the vampire runs for it. The turning is a delicate process and since it wasn't finished Harry is left in a delicate state. I think he was mentally broken and wouldn't stop crying. The vampire feels guilty because he didn't intentionally try to hurt Harry and tries to get him back, but Dumbledore and the rest of the light side will stop at nothing to keep them apart. This story focuses on vampire childe-sire bonds. It was either a one-shot or abandoned. I also think the vampire was an OC character because for the life of me I couldn't remember his name so it definitely wasn't a recognizable canon character. To be more specific the vampire isn't paired with Harry as they are sire and childe so more like father and son.
