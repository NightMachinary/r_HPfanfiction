#+TITLE: Just saw another prompt about what would happen if Harry hadn't yet removed the horcrux, instead, what if Harry made 'his own' horcrux to split away Voldemort's soul piece so he could turn safely destroy it.

****** That's fantastic :D, I actually just got done rereading it again yesterday and I was positive you weren't come back to it which would be a damn shame, even if there are a couple cliche bits it's easily the best Harry dimension hops/time travels fic I've ever read.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

** I mean, in theory it's a good idea. The issue is, you don't know which part of his should will be split off. Sure, voldemort's part would probably be split off easier, but it's not certain

Also, I'm pretty sure creating a Horcrux halves your soul each time, though don't quote me on that. Because the part of voldy my dude's soul was only a fraction (because he made hella horcruxes before his accidental one), if Harry halved his soul it would be voldemort's piece and a bit of his own that came flying off.

*** I /think/ the halving each time is fanon, but don't quote me on that. Where those complications lead could create an interesting story I think, as well as the ramifications on someone who is remorseful over the circumstances of creation... Or alternately leads to the corruption of the individual... Either way

**** I certainly think Harry would feel remorseful over the horcrux creation. Like you said, it would be an interesting story, especially if it was an evil! Harry or dark! Harry fic. He would ensure his immortality bit also keep his sanity. Terrifying

  In the aftermath of a peaceful summer comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually. And now, a free remastered version is coming to my website!

*** Damnit, I've seen that one a few times and it sounds interesting, but I have a hard time with the bittersweet endings... I'll admit I have a bad habit of checking the ending to make sure it's at least mostly happy before I get invested. Is it worth the read even with the less than happy ending?

**** I didn't love it and am not recommending it, but if I'm not mistaken it does have the plot point of modifying the horcrux creation ritual to remove the scarcrux.
