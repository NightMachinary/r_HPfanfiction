:END:
I'm looking for a pre-Half-Blood Prince story, so written before July 2005, definitely on fanfiction.net website, might have been cross-posted elsewhere.

Basic synopsis: Lily is shy and studious; I believe Lily also wears glasses and possibly wears her hair in braids or pigtails. Anyway, James is more outgoing, but this writer wasn't focused on popularity, and he pursues her in a way that was not very aggressive, definitely felt like a slow build romance. He was chivalrous. At the time I would even say that it felt very manwa/manhua-romance influenced, so Lily is a rather passive female character. I think the story ends at their graduation or shortly after, but I can't remember exactly when it starts other than not 1st year.

The pov is narrator focuses on Lily's feelings and insights. Not a James POV

It was so good but I did not bookmark it the 15 or so years ago and I've really got a hankering for this specific fic, as I was just dumped via telephone (thank you Covid-19, my breakup was socially distant).
