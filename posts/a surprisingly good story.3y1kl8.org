After DH Harry falls in with Andromeda Tonks, who acts as a mentor and guide. There is very little in this story that has been done before, I am adding it to one of my all time favorites. Harry/Andromeda/Luna Hermione/Lisa T almost good guy Snape Worth a read IMO


** Wasn't this terrible fic recommended the other day? What's going on? Are you the author?

*** not mine by a long shot. It is just I wanted to see something different. This was different. My writing is different, although I had some followers and I woould like to think some interesting ideas.

Pretty obviously not the same person, couldn't tell you if one or the other is the author.

**** I know, but I just find it really odd that such a weird fic has been recommended twice in a short amount of time, both with similar kind of tone.

*** nasty, yes but not a cookie cutter cliche that you have to look at the title to see which story you are reading. maybe I overstated it a little.

** I wouldn't call it suprisingly good. It does some interesting things, but its rushed and the characters feel very one-sided.

The reason why I read it was the interesting pairings.
