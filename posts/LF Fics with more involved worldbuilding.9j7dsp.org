Basically, I want something like the lower alleys in murkybluematter's Pureblood Pretense series. linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense; The Serpentine Subterfuge; The Ambiguous Artifice; The Futile Facade) Or how Knockturn Alley was in that one fix where Harry had a Peverell alias, it had to be downloaded as a PDF because it's not up anymore. I think it was called Out of the Night by Raining Ink.


** I have a healthy dose of political worldbuilding in my series, which starts with linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn). It also features Harry, Ron, and Hermione all in Slytherin, and I'm currently writing the third volume of the series.

*** Yea, I am actually already a fan of your series, but here I was looking for an internal magical community, sort of like the place where Ron and later Ginny work in your story, but more generally involving the whole community, if you've read either of the above works you'll probably know what I mean?

** I don't know if it will fit your criteria, but I am working on one that will eventually get around to doing a fair bit of world building. The thing is I am trying to do it as a show don't tell story so there aren't exposition dumps. It is added to bit by bit as it is relevant to the MC.

** I go into quite a lot of magical Europe in "Dawn of Darkness", so far mostly the magical HRE and magical Spain. The story is set in many locations across the continent as Harry has to travel there due to the plot. Grindelwald's rise and fall, as well as his former followers, will be part of future chapters (and I am not using FB Grindelwald).
