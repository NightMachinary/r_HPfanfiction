Zombies, Armageddon, a Meteorite, World War 3; anything happens, and the magical world misses it somehow.


** This sorta kinda maybe matches your request. The Ministries ignore it until it bites them in the arse. Dumbledore/McGonagall bashing. I re-read this recently and had to doublecheck to make sure it came out before the Corona Virus.

*Hagrid Saves the World* - linkffn(13388116)\\
Trelawney makes a prophecy to Hagrid. Hagrid goes right to work. Dumbledore messes up and unleashes some sort of Zombie Virus. The Ministries worldwide ignore it. It bites them in the arse.

The story is pretty dark at points. Until the ending, that was pretty much "That's so Hagrid".

  A real prophecy involves Rubeus Hagrid. In Harry's second year, the giant spends his days planting a hedge around Hogwarts. Story takes dark turn every once in a while with "wait... what?" Lots of bashing of Dumbledore, McGonagall, Fudge, and Umbridge. There'll be seven parts.

** linkffn(7539141) is a partial match for your idea. The magical world is well aware of what has happened, but it is continuing on in relative prosperity while the Muggle world collapses.

  A year has passed since the dead started returning to life. The fate of those hoping to survive and rebuild rests on the best and the worst of humanity, both wizards and Muggles, with their political ideologies and the ravenous undead in between, and it's up to Healer Harry Potter to save as many as he can in the crossfire. A Harry Potter Zombie Apocalypse Fanfiction. HP/AG.

** Whom the Gods Would Destroy by ianthewaiting, Hermione/Charlie Weasley apocalypse fic, but it's basically the end of the wizarding world too so not quite what you're looking for. It's incredible and one of the best fics I've read. Not a pairing I'd ever read, and wasn't sure but it's so well written and plotted. Idk how to link it according to the rules here so I won't but it should be easy to find on ff.net

*** While savior is one of my favorite stories, it doesn't fit the criteria they were looking for. They knew when the death of the mug goes happened didn't ignore it
