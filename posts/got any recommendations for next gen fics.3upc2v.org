i almost prefer if its AU, at least that way there isn't someone called Albus Severus /shudders/


** Sadly, there's very few AU's in next gen. There's linkffn(Albus Potter and the Global Revelation) , linkffn(Albus Potter and the Dungeon of Merlin's Mist) and linkffn(Hogwarts Houses Divided) out of standard next-gen, but I assume you've heard of those already.

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

  -BOOK 1/7. COMPLETE. Structured like original HP books. Series to be concluded in summer 2015!- Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all.

There are also a couple nice postwar ones - one in particular is about a series of photos Dennis Creevey takes after the war - but I can't remember their titles. When I do I'll put them here.

EDIT: found the camera one - it's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize]]
