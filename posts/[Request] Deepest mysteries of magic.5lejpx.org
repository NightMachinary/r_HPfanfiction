Like Fractal by OnTheImportanceOfLungs, i am looking for fics that deal with deep and mysterious magic. By "deep" i mean the stuff transcending "wave your wand and say fancy things"-type magic, focusing instead on magic in a more grand way. Looking at the nature of magic, and asking questions like why does it work? is it sentient? etc. is all good. Fractal is exactly the type of stuff i'm looking for - anyone know of anything similar?

It's a 'mage-sight' fanfiction but considerably more realistic rather than the usual overpowered style. It's Harry/Hermione and both research the various mysteries of magic.

*** Harry is massively overpowered in this. The fic isn't about a central conflict; It's just an exploration of magic so OP should enjoy it.

  1957 A tree in Albania, she said. Straightforward enough, right? Not if someone else got there first. Tom's journey in acquiring the vessel for his fifth Horcrux just got that much trickier. An exploration of White Magic. Canon-compliant. Longshot. OC

  It's funny how the world works. There are too many things near and dear to us for a wand to be drawn at every occasion. Everyone has a story, and the lines and points come together to form a web of something too ephemeral to measure. Harry thinks that the strands are snapping a bit too quickly. A rewrite of The Wizard of the Kaleidoscope. Added to the DLP Library.

** The Albus Potter series deals with a branch of extremely powerful and sort of mystical magic called Devoctrix's. I recommend this series a lot here since it's one of the best I've ever read.
