it's in their blood so definite possibility slytherin? friends with Malfoy?


** LMAO Dudley isn't a Slytherin at all, he isn't cunning or ambitious at all.

** I don't see Dudley ever being 'friends' with Malfoy (even disregarding that he'd be a Muggleborn) - you'd need to change a /lot/ there to make that possible.

I think he'd probably end up in Hufflepuff, since he's not brave, cunning, or smart.

*** I was thinking he'd just lie since hes related to Harry Potter ppl would just assume Dudley is also a pure blood and not all slytherin are brave, cunning, or smart like crab and goyleel. or really anyone that tried to turn in harry potter during that big fight cause like did they really think anyone would agree?
