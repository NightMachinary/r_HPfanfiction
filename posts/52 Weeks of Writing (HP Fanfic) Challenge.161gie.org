** Fanfic authors: This looks really, really intense. I am trying to do it, and including some of AlwaysPadfoot's prompts in my own challenge, which is to create very vivid, intense 100 word drabbles that illuminate a character or a moment in their lives.

Anyone else want to join in?

*** All the luck to you! It's too intense for me. I have not written a story in years. I cant even complete a one-shot. Yet, I can read and track/catalog hundreds of fics I'm reading/have read over a 5 year span. Go figure?

** me = GinnyMyLove, if you know my work, you know I could probably hit the most words and kinkiest prizes easily...when I wrote the first +couple+ /40/ chapters of Searching For The Power I was writing 4-10k words a week...

But to commit...I havent written in months...I didn't even do NaNoWriMo this year...

I need some encouragement if any of you know who I am and want me to do it...I'm scared

** Have fun! I participate in the occasional 8-week LDWS (last drabble writer standing) challenge on livejournal, but 52 weeks is a little too long for me.

*** Fortunately, if you miss a week you can keep participating. You just don't qualify for "last man standing." ;-)
