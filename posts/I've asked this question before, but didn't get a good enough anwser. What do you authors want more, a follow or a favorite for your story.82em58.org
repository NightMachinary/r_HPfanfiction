I've always only used favorite, and I check every few hours on the website if there's an update, a simple F5, instead of receiving email after email for every update. But IDK if its worse for an author to only have a favorite or if its better a follow. I review about 80% of the stories I read. I only don't for those that are either too bad (I'd rather not say anything than say your story sucks) or if its abandoned. Otherwise, I try to review whenver I enjoy the story, which is most of the time.

EDIT: I know most want reviews, this isn't what the question is about, its whether follow or favorite is better FOR the author. Which apparently most say its Favorites, for better exposure.


** I want a review. Review are more important to me, as it will let me start a dialogue with the reviewer.

** I don't care at all about follows or favorites. I don't even look at those numbers. I want reviews.

** Honestly, either is good (or both). Though, I suppose a favorite is better for exposure since then your story is on someone's profile page and visible to all. Then when someone goes to look at their list of favorites they will see your story and possibly read it.

** Favorites allow for easier exposure, but reviews are nice too. But unless it's a one-shot or a two-shot, you'll nearly always have more follows than favorites.

** Couldn't care less about follows. To me, it's a tool to /follow/ works in progress. I cannot fathom why people follow fics tagged complete. Favorites are often used not as the reader's favorites but as a way to keep track of what they've read. So, neither really means much. I like reviews. Of course we all know the general low quality of FFN "reviews", but sometimes you get a gem that puts a smile on your face.

*** I don't understand following completed stories, either. Whenever I see one of my completed stories has a follow, I think to myself, "Well, they're going to be disappointed." I guess like you say, it's for keeping track.

I'm definitely in the prefer reviews category and I do have to say that I've gotten some pretty decent ones on FF.net. I do wish though that you could respond directly to the review like on AO3. I've gotten a couple of guest reviews I would have liked to reply to, but since they were a guest, I couldn't.

**** It's an auto response.

If I like a story I will favorite and follow it even if it is finished.

** I don't know if I prefer follows or favorites more. Like previous commenters, reviews are the most desired/helpful but very few readers leave reviews.

** Oh favourites without a doubt. I don't think someone will favourite unless they really like something, and are happy for other people to see it on their profile. A follow might mean they want to know what happens next or it might just mean the reader wants to be able to find it again at some point.

All my stories are finished, but I still get the odd follow.

** Favorites are more likely to extend readership, but I can understand if the reader doesn't consider the story 'worth spreading the word' but at least is interested in how things progress.

** I put work out on occasion as a meager repayment for the works that others have given me. I don't do it for feedback. So if you like something I write and want others to discover it, review if you tend to sort by reviews, or favorite if you tend to sort by favorites. I won't see it in either case, so it doesn't matter to me.

** Follow me as the author (not that I write anymore).

But my philosophy in writing is to write what I want to see. So as whatever as it sounds I never really cared either way.

But if you were gonna do one or the other follow me.
