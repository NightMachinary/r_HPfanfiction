As the title says, can you guys take a look at my fic? Few people seem to make it past the first chapter. Is it really that bad and I'm a terrible writer? Let me know, but don't be too soul crushing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13153117/1/The-Rubicon]]

EDIT: I appreciate all the feedback guys. Looks like I have some cleanup on to work on. Thanks.


** Well, to be honest, I couldn't make it more of a quarter of the way through. Mostly it was the sentence structure and the way you shifted tenses, because most people don't like short sentences. You can add them for flair! But a lot of people get annoyed at all the “stops” that appear in the story. I also could tell you were trying to go for mystery over people speaking. I think if you fixed the writing structure, it might go over better.

** Only read the first paragraph, but critiques on that:

1) not about the short sentences, but the lack of variation. It's generally good practice to break up long sentences in writing, but wrt what other people have posted, it's not that short sentences are bad but that variation is good. First book starts out with a short sentence but then proceeds with longer ones. Short sentences should be used sparingly, when you want to really emphasize the content of that sentence. Variation is good: build a rhythm to the words. If all of them are short it feels like a dubstep but you want a symphony, so intersperse the long and short sentences to put the emphasis where you want it. Else, it's like putting an entire comment in bold instead of just the highlights.

2) "made sense, it was his meeting" is not a sentence: is fine for Reddit and stuff to talk like that (notice I did it there, omitting a subject and letting it be implied) but is not cool for formal writing or stories. Also decide whose perspective you're writing from: who is it that knows it was his meeting? Do they even know that? If so, something like "It made sense, as it was his meeting" would be an improvement.

3) show, don't tell. Instead of "seemed frustrated" (paraphrase, can't remember the exact wording and can't see it on mobile when typing) show us that he's frustrated with an action instead of just telling us he's frustrated. For example "his eyes flashed dangerously" vs "he seemed angry." Here, maybe something like "he paced and stroked his beard" vs "seemed frustrated" -- decide what it is that tips the POV character off that the other character is frustrated and describe that vs giving us the conclusion the POV character gets, and trust the reader to deduce that the other character is frustrated.

4) referencing the above: omniscient narrators are really hard to write. Better to decide on a point of view character and describe what they're seeing as opposed to just trying to tell the whole story. Also leaves you room for more surprises (a la Harry thinking snape is the bad guy all through book 1 and finding out he's wrong at the end). If you need a moment of omniscient narrator like the first chapter of HP, write everything else and do that last.

However, I think you really have a knack for storytelling (loved the "makes sense, as it was his meeting" in sentiment, if not in structure -- perfect for an HP FF as is very snarkily JKR) so keep asking questions/for feedback and keep writing!

*** I'm so very tired of eyes flashing dangerously or glazing lovingly; if you look at people when they talk, their eyeballs don't really do much for the conversation beyond widening or narrowing. I get that it is an easy way to show vs. tell but I feel like phrases like that are purple prose and are best used sparingly, or to describe someone who is naturally dramatic like Dumbledore and Snape are.

**** Yes, was definitely wildly cliche, just went with the first/most obvious example from the HP books. I think when people talk about eyes doing stuff they mean the whole eye region as opposed to just the literal eyes, so it includes the eyebrows. Those definitely do show so much expression, but it feels weird to always be talking about eyebrows so I feel like people just talk about eyes instead.

** My immediate thoughts: you have too many unnecessary paragraph breaks, and you keep shifting tenses. Both of these things are somewhat jarring, and in general rather annoying to a reader. You also seem to have a lot of short, choppy sentences; I can't get through the first chapter for these things alone, so I can't say anything about plot or characterisation

** Don't be discouraged. While I agree with the others about the shifting tenses and choppy sentences I (and many others) have endured through much worse writing in fanfictions for the sake of an interesting plot. In terms of content, I read through all that you have posted and I feel a little lost. I feel like we need more background to lay groundwork for your divergences from canon. As the story is right now I was unable to really get myself invested in it. If you are trying for mystery they you need to have something big right off the bat to build suspense and hook people in to have them commit long enough to get all the background.

** Sorry, but the first paragraph is already not very good. "Made sense, it was his meeting" sounds like you have POV narration going on, giving us the internal thoughts of the character. But then: "After a time he seemed satisfied...". So our (omniscient?) narrator is partial to intimate thoughts of a character, but can't tell whether they are satisfied?

Other things:

#+begin_quote
  He was saved from an awkward response by the arrival of several new arrivals
#+end_quote

Try to avoid word repetitions like this. Especially if they are redundant. "He was saved from an awkward response by the new arrivals."

#+begin_quote
  The two grin as they shake hands.
#+end_quote

Suddenly we are in present tense for no apparent reason.

#+begin_quote
  In all fairness, he did practice.
#+end_quote

Again a problem in narration, that makes it sound like limited POV. This narrator doesn't even know these characters names, but suddenly he has intimate information to offer.

#+begin_quote
  The fear and uncertainty he had felt was gone. Resolve took their place.
#+end_quote

Same issue.

#+begin_quote
  sits reading a letter
#+end_quote

...

#+begin_quote
  The letter was from one Sirius Black
#+end_quote

Try to stick to one tense, especially in a single paragraph.

#+begin_quote
  for he has sat reading many letter in this very room. The interesting thing about this letter was the content.
#+end_quote

Too much embellishment. The letter is very mundane and not very interesting. Harry seems to agree ("Sirius had been quite busy lately so this was not to be completely unexpected")

#+begin_quote
  (a satchel that Hermoine had enchanted for him that had a built in extradimensional space)
#+end_quote

...

#+begin_quote
  (this was also the only picture on his desk that was not moving)
#+end_quote

...

#+begin_quote
  (as Sirius had told him "Any duelist worth his salt has a wrist Sheath")
#+end_quote

...

#+begin_quote
  (avoiding the second to last step)
#+end_quote

Parenthesis explanations like this can be okay in essays, but really should be avoided in narrative fiction. All of these can either be a normal part of the sentence or removed.

#+begin_quote
  Draco Malfoy hates summer break
#+end_quote

I'm noticing a pattern here. Did you intend to write this story in present tense and just forgot after the first paragraph of each scene break?

Chapter 2: Why is there a "Date" "Location" thing twice for the same location?

Why does Harry call Draco "Draco" instead of "Malfoy"?

--------------

I'll stop here. I like AU stories and there are some interesting bits here, definitely some potential. It just has too many technical issues right now.

** The tenses needed a bit of work and the sentence structure could've been better, and also remember you only really need a new paragraph for a new point or a new person talkingdepending on how you like to write. I would reccomend rereading paragraphs out to yourself and seeing how thwy flow or if something sounds strange. Keep in mind that very often gramatically correct sentences can sound incorrect.

Example:

The great, green dragon.

The green, great dragon.

They're both correct technically, but writing is like music, just like unless you have variation in sentence length, structure and word choice it drones on, writing is all trial and error. One sentence for a vitally important plot point or a paragraph full of short, basic sentences isn't appreciated by readers just like a thousand sentences, each a hundred words long talking about a character's hair colour gets tiring.

Also: I'd pay more attention to characters speach patterns as well as thinking more about true motives and intent when writing dialogue, as well as body language.

** For me, the dealbreaker was the repetition of words, and spelling/punctuation issues such as:

#+begin_quote
  otherwise quite (quite)

  arrival of several new arrivals (repetition)

  wrist Sheath (unnecessary capitalization)

  burn of (burn off)

  Dursley's (Dursleys)
#+end_quote

Also, don't be afraid to make the sentences a bit longer. You don't need to break them up so much, it's bad for the flow. For example I'd prefer:

#+begin_quote
  He pauses here, expecting something - a question, an outburst - yet they continue to watch him.
#+end_quote

Plus, don't continue to refer to the characters as "arrivals" well into the chapter. I think if you were a bit consistent, I could get used to the tenses. Everyone else said the rest. Good luck!

**** I'm not gonna lie, I've been reading HP Fanfiction for almost 10 years, so I think i've probably read 50million words plus of fanfiction at this point.

I purely read for the story. I can shut my brain off and skip over the writing, as long as the plot is good.

Obviously an absolute shit show will catch my attention, but nothing major jumped out that caught my eye, so it can't have been that bad.

** The biggest things are as others said; formatting and tense issues, and maybe a few other minor errors here and there. best bet is to see if you can find a beta to help pick these things out.

Personally what I do to help me see issues, is write whatever it is i'm working on, then set it aside for a week or two before coming back to edit it. Our brains will gloss over errors or distractions in our writing after we just wrote it because its already *just8 taken in that information, and it thinks it doesn't need to look much deeper at it in the moment. Putting time between writing the work and editing it helps the details fade a little so you can properly see things you might not otherwise. :)

*** I think tense issues are particularly a problem because they're immersion-breaking. A shift from past tense to present tense really throws out the flow of reading. And breaking immersion is very bad for retaining readers.

The same applies to lots of other things: typos, overly casual/overly formal speech, inconsistent characterisation, plot holes. Does it make the reader trip up and think, "Hang on, that doesn't seem right"? Then it's a problem. Different people give different weight to different problems, of course, but ultimately, no-one likes a story to remind them that it's just a story.

** “This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It's like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety. Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length. And sometimes, when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the cymbals--sounds that say listen to this, it is important.”
