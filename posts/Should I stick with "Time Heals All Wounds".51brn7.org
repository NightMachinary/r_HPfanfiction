I usually never read fics pairing Bellatrix with anyone because I think it would be REALLY hard to redeem her. However, I gave THAW a chance because it is highly rec'd in this sub all the time. I am about a third of the way through (just finished the part with the Kelpie) and I am really just not that into it. But interestingly, my problem with it is how Hermione is written, not with Bellatrix.

Hermione is written kinda like a Mary-Sue so far. It is unclear why she likes Bellatrix at all (much less loves her) other than that Bella is smart. Hermione just doesn't feel like herself - for example, the parts from her POV don't have her studying time travel to figure out how to get back or to change the future - things that canon-hermione would DEFINITELY be doing.

My main question is should I stick with this fic? It comes so highly regarded that I am considering staying with it, but if the characterization of Hermione stays like this maybe I should quit.


** I haven't read the fic, but for what it's worth, I don't think I've ever seen a badly written character get redeemed/polished later on.

With fanfics, if there's a point you realize you don't like it, it usually doesn't get any better.

** I admit I was not impressed with this fic at all, and I was bummed because it was always so highly recommended here.

I can't put my finger on what I didn't like about it.

I like Bellatrix, and I do like Hermione. I just didn't buy their relationship at all.

*** I know right!? Why do they even "love" eachother? It's totally out of nowhere and based on nothing as far as I can tell...

**** A ton of fanfics are just gimmicks that the author wants to realize in writing. It's a bonus if it makes sense!

*** Hah really? I have never noticed that before. It's on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3jkd9l/most_frequently_recommended_fics_top_20_august/][this list]] of most frequently recommended fics. But maybe that is still the same people over and over.

**** I've personally never seen that fic recced anywhere, and I've read through the vast majority of decent HP fics, for what it's worth. Review count isn't spectacular either for a fic with that many chapters.

**** Yeah I feel like it is recced all the time too, but maybe because I'm always looking for Hermione-centric fics. It always comes up when people are looking for "rare" pairings.

** I think it is highly regarded relative to other Hermione/Bella fics (which isn't really saying much).

If it isn't for you by this point, I doubt the fic will turn it around.

** The ending really disappointed me, as well as the fact that she didn't change much. The whole thing felt like an angst delivery vehicle. I don't usually read fics where angst is in the genre, and this one reminded me why.

linkffn(10099028) is the only fic I liked with the same pairing. Hermione may seem ooc in it, but keep in mind that this world had no Voldemort, and she didn't have life threatening adventures every year.

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.
