Did you know that was a thing? Some while ago I read a fanfiction where Harry somehow ends up in the 1970s to change the curse of war. The fanfic was pretty decent but it confused me to a great deal that Purblood parents would let their kids marry the same gender, bc where do the heirs come from? From the stork? Sorry to disappoint you, but no. ( It is worth mentioning that the only pairings I saw where a few heterosexual ships from original canon and the rest were like Male x Male. I don't remember any Female x Female. Hardly anybody was straight without being bisexual but for what are fanfictions for?)

Back to the issue, there were no problems with the lack of producing offsprings (without mother nature that is). The fanfic had a solution for that! Mpreg (Male Pregnancy). That is were I kind of drew the line. It is just unimaginable for me. Like, how? You want to tell me to ignore the Anatomy of a male body? Everything is excused with a potion? Why?

Maybe my rant was a little bit too much and I am overreacting, because 'ahh it is only a fanfiction, everything is possible and especially when Magic can be used to excuse nearly everything' ,but I just needed to write that down and this subreddit is a good place for that.


** Since it seems to be a weird sexualisation of pregnancy and homosexuality, I'm not touching MPreg with a ten-foot pole.

That being said, the only way I can see that happen would be a female metamorph living as a man, although that wouldn't be entirely MPreg in the first place (and metamorphs can be tricky when it comes to gender definitions in the first place).

Overall, it makes no sense in slashfics. Adoption or surrogate mothers are options. Insisting on the pregnancy because it is necessary for a "proper" child is some serious shade thrown at anyone adopted. If you want to have one of them end up pregnant, just genderbend them. Dominant female characters are perfectly viable after all, if you want the same dynamics (and metamorphs should be able to grow a very lifelike strap-on). Or pick a different character. A time-travelling Bellatrix Black or Narcissa Black can easily be turned into Draco, character wise.

*** If MPREG doesn't make sense to you try not to look into the technicalities of A/B/O. It's not really my cup of tea but my curiosity got the better of me... not really something I would recommend lol

** I think that it's largely harmless as a concept but in execution it often comes across as sexist/homophobic with stereotyping gay couples along the lines of 'well which one of you is the woman' and portraying pregnant people as weepy/emotional/fragile in general.

** It smacks of turning gay men into women once in a relationship, and also makes it appear as if adopting kids or using a surrogate mother is "not good enough" for a family.

** Honestly, Mpreg makes me really uncomfortable, largely because of the anatomy issues you brought up. I can't read them because I get too hung up on the idea of the male ‘womb' and the birthing canal which is presumably the penis.

And, if I ever consider it further, the other reasons people have said re adoption, surrogacy, making a homosexual relationship mirror a heterosexual one.

But my initial feeling of discomfort is based on the anatomy.

** If a potion can make a girl grow cat whiskers, hair, and ears, I have no problem believing another potion could make a man grow a uterus. The fics using "Mpreg" are usually terrible, mind you. But I don't think it's at all weird that /Harry Potter/ magic could theoretically do this.

*** In my fanfic universes, I do allow for same sex couples to have children, but it's in a way that I think is much more normal and realistic than "Mpreg" ideas - though that can work too if it's not flanderized or fetishized like in most fanfics that use it. My way, is by way of magically created, standalone "artificial" wombs in magical hospitals (and by artificial I mean literal flesh and blood wombs conjured up and isolated with sterilized environment charms, because it's magic). They have special wards for this process, to combine DNA and make children there for them to come take home after development is finished. It only costs a small fee - like, in muggle money it'd be like twenty bucks, equivalent. So nobody has to be blocked out of it by outrageous prices, like so many nonmagic procedures we have. Also because it's just not a big deal, as they've had it for a few hundred years already, and magic never fails, so there's no risk of anything to it.

It's like computers. They used to be super huge and cost 10000$ but now everybody can go get a computer in a cell phone at any store on a whim.

Do you think an embryo/child would develop normally if it is isolated from human contact, voices, etc for the entirety of its gestation in the womb? I have the feeling that there'd be lots of issues with socially handicapped children and arrested development.

***** Well maybe people at the hospital go in and talk to them or around them? Or they just put enchanted sapient paintings around to do it all the time? Or they play radios near them? Or use a magic spell to make constant noise stream?

Deathcrow friend, any issues you could think of can be easily solved, so there are no issues with it because you can ASSUME they thought of it already.:) Especially with the power to break and warp reality on their side.

** It is one of the topics I whole heartedly would want to take a book of common biology and recommend it to the face of whoever has chosen to write such absurdity. Mpreg in itself is acceptable as a niche-product much like most other kinks, however the almost pendantic need to add rape/falling-in-love-with-rapist to the concept is.... truly concerning.

I, much like many others, would not read such a story.

But, as it is, - it exists and as such we will have to find a way to arrange ourselves around it.

** It's just conceptually stupid. Male = inseminates eggs; Female = provides eggs to be fertilized

If Harry gets pregnant and has ovaries or whatever, he's no longer male. He's either some kind of hermaphrodite or just plain female. As someone else has said it's basically a sex-transformation potion or something like that?! But I guess for the sake of the fantasy the 'maleness' has somehow to be preserved, so we arrive at Mpreg.

Incidentally, how do gay men feel about trans-men? Isn't that sort of a similar scenario? Representing as men, but biologically female?

I don't care, you can play with gender roles about men and women as much as you like, but biology is pretty simple.

** I can understand how Mpreg and A/B/O and associated tropes squick people, but I have zero problem with it, particularly in HP. In a fictional world where Metamorphmages who can manipulate any bit of their bodies at will _are canon_, why couldn't a self-identifying male character choose to have a baby?

** I think it could be very interesting as an addition to a gender transformation fix (metamorph or magic).

However, honestly hp doesn't really have many decent crossing the gender divide fics, much less those that deal with pregnancy.

The MPreg stuff I have seen out there has all the same flaws as the other hpfanfic sins: Magical Cores, Marriage Laws, etc.

Instead of "Having a magical connection to someone's emotions seems like an interesting situation with potential for a good story", you have "I want these characters to have a connection, magical handwavie reason that it is forced to happen."

For other handling of it, you have lighthearted/don't think too hard in Xanth.

Or to bring out some of the grandmasters, Heinland had --All You Zombies--, and McCaffery had one I think...

In short: possible very interesting topic for sci-fi/fantasy, not done well in hpfanfiction...
