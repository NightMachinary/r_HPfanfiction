:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I believe it was on fanfiction.net. I think Voldemort never happened and Tom Riddle was a teacher at Hogwarts. Pretty sure it was completed, too.


** You are looking for a fic by the author named [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1824571/Silverfawkes][Silverfawkes]].

​

The first is: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6320683/1/Yet-Another-Universe][Yet Another Universe]], it is rushed and in sore need of beta and grammar check.

And the sequel: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7077695/1/Yet-Again][Yet Again]] while the previous one is kinda fun this one is really weird. And gay. Whole lotta gay.

​

But do enjoy.

*** I think this was it, you may be right. It's worse than I remember and was actually never finished. Still kind of entertaining though.

Thanks for your help!

** I've looking for this for years!

I thought it was a continuation of the time travel fic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Oh God Not Again!]], but I couldn't find anything in the authors' page.
