  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

** You know, so many people assume that it's obvious that the diary is a dark artifact... but is it actually obvious?

I mean, sure, you have Mr. Weasley's “never trust anything if you can't see where it keeps its brain” but this is obviously nonsense. Like, hello, portraits? Sorting Hat. Marauders Map. The semi-sentient Ford Anglia. Talking mirrors.

I kind of figure that Mr. Weasley's advice is more along the lines of when we tell little kids “Don't talk to strangers.” It's advice that's only applicable to small children - in real, everyday adult life people talk to strangers all the time. It's not actually good advice applicable to everyone.

I can actually imagine that diaries that write back are /standard/ in the wizarding world, and that people would look at you funny for writing in a regular blank diary. “Why write in it if no one's supposed to read it and it doesn't even give you advice? Seems like a waste of time to me. Muggles are weird.”

I think I'll call [citation needed] on that. Dumbledore never saw the diary until it already had a hole through the middle.

It's true that he used the Sword of Gryffindor to destroy Horcruxes when it was available, and provided it as the tool of choice for 17-year-olds. But that doesn't rule out the possibility that a wizard as old as himself could have found other ways if need be.

**** Voldemort's enchantments seem to hold up well against being broken. Dumbledore cannot end the enchantment on the cave wall, Dumbledore can't cross the lake except with the boat, and he can't grab the fake locket without drinking the potion. He was able to bypass them because of circumventions (similar to basilisk venom being a circumvention of horcrux protections). The ring's protections end up fatally harming Dumbledore and he destroys the ring, cracking the resurrection stone.

I find it unlikely that he would risk harm to the resurrection stone, something he plans on giving to Harry who he loves, if he could have stripped the protections from the ring and then proceeded to use more precise methods of destroying the ring without risking harm to the stone. I also find it unlikely that Dumbledore would have risked harming Harry by bringing him to the cave as a necessary loophole if he could have broken Voldemort's enchantments around the cave.

We don't actually know that he /can't/ do those things, we just know he doesn't, and there could be plenty of reasons for that. I'd imagine breaking those enchantments would be a process, not just like wave your wand and done. The cave seems like it's only accessible while the tide is low, so maybe it would take too long and the cave would flood, or maybe working out a tricky enchantment seems less risky than taking the boat while he's in a cave with a bunch of inferi. Maybe he's worried about some sort of hidden alarm, that'd tip off V that he's in there. Just because he doesn't take a few days to unravel the enchantments doesn't mean he lacks the skill to do it.

Was he planning on giving Harry the stone /at that point/? That's really not indicated in canon. (Sure he wills it to him, but that's not til > a year later). What we know from canon is that at the point he's getting the ring, he plans on using it himself, because that's exactly what he does. Which then leaves him cursed, and makes it necessary to destroy it on the spot.

He may very well have gone in there planning on taking whatever Horcrux it was back to Hogwarts to see if there was a way to remove it without damaging the stone, and his weakness in finding the stone and putting on the ring sabotaged those plans. In fact, if later events are an indication, that may well have been what he was planning: he didn't take any method of destroying a Horcrux to the cave, indicating he planned on returning with it to Hogwarts, to study/destroy at his leisure.

****** I think the main issue with your points are that they're the less likely explanation. Why would he place Harry in danger? When you hear hoofbeats, think horses not zebras and also occam's razor. This means that you should consider the less complicated, more likely answer as correct. The answer that he can't do those things is far more simple and invites less questions than your hypothesis.

Your second point is null under this sort of thinking as well. Why does it matter if he was planning on giving Harry the stone at that point? He can't deal with the curse, and I doubt he would want to risk damage to the stone if he could avoid it even if he wasn't planning on giving to Harry. He literally spent a childhood obsessing over it.

Frankly, our argument seems to be contrived in a roundabout way to support your ideas. If my thinking is good enough for medical students, I think it's good enough to resolve a Harry Potter debate.
