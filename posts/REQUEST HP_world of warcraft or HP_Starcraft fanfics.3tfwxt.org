** The only HP/SC crossover I've been able to enjoy was 13th stepping. It's been taking down from ffn though, so you'd have to find an archive with it, but PC has about the first quarter of the story up.

******* Question- How different is WoW from the thirty million other MMORPGs?

I've played stuff like Tera, DDO, and a few others and they all seem great at first and then I'll hit level 20 and realize nothing is going to change from here aside from the occasional new ability. That's usually when I stop playing.

******** I'm not entirely sure. I tried Tera and didn't like it. I tried DDO and didn't like it. I used to raid in WoW hardcore before we switched to SWToR. I was in SWToR NiM raiding for a couple years until I couldn't deal with the bugs anymore, so started MMO shopping. Tried GW2, which was fun but very unfamiliar, and so went back to WoW July of this year. I stuck with WoW for a couple months, and there really is so much stuff to do in game now (especially once you hit the higher levels and start building your garrison) but now that I'm older it just doesn't hold my attention as really, you can play the entire game without being exposed to much plot at all. That said the most fun I had in WoW when I recently came back? Rolling an alliance shaman enhancement, which I have never played, and leveling up via dungeons and PvP. Just so much fun. Wrecking people. Oh I loved it. OK, maybe I will play some WoW. However...

I'm all about The Secret World now. We've been playing for two months and I love it. Probably helps we're also running a Hunter: The Reckoning campaign so the setting is familiar (my husband owns 90% of the White Wolf books, no joke, an entire bookshelf is full of them) but I like the diversity of play style much like I loved Rift when it first came out, with the added bonus of amazing setting and story telling.

So really, maybe you need to get past the level 20 hump in wow and get to level 70? Outlands is still so beautiful (original Outlands) and the garrison stuff is really fun/interesting...but also can become a lot of work if you decide you're going to do more than one or two characters. In TSW you get all the skills and such eventually so no need for different toons - really TSW is the first MMO I have found that is actually "different" from the thirty million other MMORPGs.

Not sure I answered your question, but I tried =D

  Ate a bee. Became magical. Said "screw magic." Grabbed a shotgun. Went to hell. Got a hell shotgun. Found a boss, thought I killed it. Found out I didn't. It killed me. Turned into a ghost, and discovered a couple secrets. Fought octo-nipples. Fought Chtulu. Died fighting Chtulu. A lot. Fought my mother in law. Fought your mother in law. Got tired of my shotgun, and tried magic. Learned how to shoot fireballs. Become a fire weilding maniac. As a DPS, tanked through a dungeon. Got loot. Broke it, and made better loot. Got cussed out by some old Seoul lady. Spit on a Templar. Went to hell. (Again.) Found out the Illuminati is super powerful because it has a robot that learns from the internet. Had all powerful being ask for a high five, before realizing it had no hands, and then threatened to kill me like a 12 year playing COD. And I haven't even gotten to the good parts.

That's the top Steam review for The Secret World and I'm totally fucking buying this.
