** I generally don't read creature fics, so you're pretty much stuck with "harry gets buff, well dressed, and sexy" or gender swap.

Clothes only - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7441197/1/The-Power-of-the-Mind-ORIGINAL][Power of the Mind]]

Gender - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][Princess of the Blacks]] (Warning: NSFW/18+ super dark squicky themes), +[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9406757/1/One-Misfired-Spell-Later][One Misfired Spell Later]]+ edit: harry poses as a girl in that one, but is actually just a metamorphmagus, here's the one I was actually thinking of: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9928419/1/Season-of-Change][Season of Change]]

General appearance: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]]

Eyes: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9391065/1/Funny-Thing-Magic][Funny Thing Magic]]

There's one where harry loses his glasses and nobody recognizes him, but I can't find it. edit: [[/u/vash3g]] found it below, [Hiding in Plain Sight]

The only creature fic that I read, I had no idea was going to get as bad as it is when I no idea it was going to get so bad: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5786099/1/Cold-blood][Cold Blood]] (though it went by a different title for a while iirc).

*** I was thinking of the same thing, the fic you couldnt find is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8937860/1/Hiding-in-Plain-Sight][Hiding in Plain Sight]]. I just reread it the other day.

The summer prior to 6th year Harry deals with Tom in a decisive, if accidental manner. That summer Harry gets a girl friend in Susan Bones, and sets about some self improvement. It is after this change to himself he discovers something a bit disturbing about the Wizarding World, something that Hermione Granger is determined to use to her advantage.

*** Oh dear.

One Misfired Spell Later seems like the biggest cliche ever of all time.

Literally the first chapter tells the read that he's a harry potter metamorphmagus, has had 90% of his magical core blocked and his intelligence has been reduced all by Dumbledore.

Can't wait to read it.

Also, are you sure that it's a gender change fic? I skimmed through some chapters and everyone refers to Harry as 'him' still, unless I missed something, I did only just skim it.

**** It is way beyond clich√©d. Also, you're right, that's not the gender change fic I was thinking of, though Harry poses as a girl for a while, and it doesn't go well.

I was actually thinking of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9928419/1/Season-of-Change][Season of Change]] by Branchwraith.

***** Don't get me wrong, these type of fics are my guilty pleasure.

It just seems like the author is putting everything out there at once so readers can know very early on if they want to continue reading.

Seems smart to me.

****** Yeah Erbkaiser is one of the more underrated authors. Except for Nymphadora's Beau, which really is one of the best HP/NT stories, he rarely gets mentioned on the sub.

******* The premise of Nymphadora's Beau looks hilarious! I'll be sure to check it out!

** Teufel1987's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6254783/1/Rise-of-the-Wizards][Rise of the Wizards]] uses this (and most other) cliche elements of fanfiction: a blood adoption by Sirius, Harry's godfather and grandfather, physically alters him and turns him into Lord Harry James Potter-Black, betrothed to the lovely Daphne Greengrass, Slytherin Ice Queen, and it snowballs from there.
