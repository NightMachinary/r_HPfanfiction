So the story is about SI or OC reincarnated into some kind of spirit exorcist clan in Japan. He is the last heir to his clan but raised without knowledge of his heritage by other clan that destroyed his clan bare his mother. He is a grown man in a boy's body so that brainwashing is futile. They teach him onmyouji magic, swordplay. At some point, he kills a bunch of clan elders, frees his mother and they flee. Then he travels to Russia (where he deals with volhvs and does some exorcism rituals) then USA (MACUSA), then France, then decides to root himself in England. And here he attempted to resurrect his clan.His clan name maybe has "hoshi" in it. I was able to remember a lot of details and plot (like /druids are eco-terrorists that locked in pocket dimensions for the most part (in France), and when they don't (in England) - they make treant-like-human good infiltrators/) but unable to locate through google by site:fanfiction.net


** Holy. That's sounds interesting.

No. But thanks anyway. The fic that I search is at least 100000 words (likely much more). And has yokai and/or ayakashi but not pokemon.
