Hey all, so it's time to join our collective wisdom together for the greater good, /ahem/. Well, at least /my/ greater good.

I'm really keen to get peoples' recommendations on some next-gen stories which are action-adventure based, avoiding the ship-centric, angsty musings that really aren't my cup of tea.

I've read most of the older recommendations that I have come across on here (e.g. Houses Divided etc.), and have just finished this Albus Potter series linkffn(8417562). I've also just started on /this/ series following James Sirius linkffn(11600979) which seems less well-known.

Does anybody have any recommendations of something similar? Basically, a (hopefully well-written) Next Gen one-shot or series in a similar action-focused style to the original books.

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!
