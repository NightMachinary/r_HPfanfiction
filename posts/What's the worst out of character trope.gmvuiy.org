Pretty simple really, what repeatedly used trope/cliche of a character that is completely OOC that you find most irritating or detestable.

For me it's got to be "sex kitten Hermione", where a nerdy bookworm who is quite clearly not all that focused on sex (to the point I still stand by that she's somewhat asexual) suddenly turning into a sex-obsessed seductress in one of the later books or post-Hogwarts.


** A Remus Lupin whose character traits extend as far as bookish, chocolate-obsessed and kind. The complexity of his cowardice and his self-loathing towards being a werewolf are completely brushed aside, which is a few of the things that make him such a rich character in the books, not to mention how internally conflicted he is about outing Sirius as an animagus despite him believing he was a murderer because his loyalty towards Dumbledore extends to not just telling the truth but maintaining a squeaky clean image of himself, ever since he allowed him a spot at Hogwarts. He's also so kind and nice despite him being shunned his entire life, he wasn't the best professor for nothing, after all. The way he dealt with Neville in front of Snape always warms my heart.

James Potter whose only defining trait is his obsession with Lily. Every single development in his character is attributed to his undying love for her, which is written to be romantic but just sounds extremely creepy. He doesn't need to mature for Lily (I don't think she'd appreciate the fact that he only became a decent person is because of her), become an animagus for his werewolf friend because he was awe-inspired by her kindness, nor join the Order because she did it first. Lily Evans would not fall in love with a bloke whose every action is defined by his love for her. That's not romantic, just extremely clingy and uncomfortable behaviour. Doodling her initials is one thing, worshipping the ground she walks on is another. Out of the four Marauders, James was the most...normal. Sirius was estranged, Pettigrew apparently a bit behind them talent-wise and chubby (which unfortunately earns bullying from others) and Lupin is a pariah in not just school, but society in general and yet he stuck with those three. That means he had goodness in his heart, however much of a jerk he was to Snape, he still had some form of decency in him, and they're not because of Lily. Saying that is unfair to his character, he could've befriended anyone else other than them who was 'normal' and left those other outcasts behind. And yet James stuck by them.

Similarly, Sirius's undying loyalty towards James. I know his form is a dog but he's not literally one, he can also think for himself. On a similar note, Snape, however much someone may hate him (me included), his every action and interest need *not* be dictated to the memory Lily. Him being good at potions doesn't have to mean he was just trying to impress her, it makes for a cute headcanon but part of his complexity is that Snape is a person with other interests but he doesn't let them override the need to avenge his former best friend. Which is *where* him being a tragic character come in: Snape had a chance while others such as Crouch Jr and Sirius did not, and he wasted it by being a bitter, grouchy and bullying teacher instead of actually trying to honour her memory by what she'd have wanted: becoming a better person and *moving on*. And yet Snape does not do that at all, he overlooks everything he has (potions and defense skills he could teach to his students) and concentrated on being a menace to the point where his student became frightened of him so much, he was his boggart aka biggest fear.

Peter Pettigrew as a person must've had some redeeming qualities to have him be trusted by Sirius, whose main concern in the war was his friends, especially James Potter and his little family. If he was always a snivelling, pathetic and lying mole, then they wouldn't've left him tagging along that long, let alone leaving their lives in his hands. So whenever a will is like 'OMG WE ALWAYS KNEW PETTIGREW WOULD BETRAY US [starts listing every single flaw within the bloke]'. Then why make him secret keeper? Anything Sirius says in the Shrieking Shack is out of hurt, not to be taken literally all of a sudden (he's the bloke who creeped out a bunch of kids by saying 'only one will die tonight'). He is *not* mentally stable, and a guy who tried to murder him on Halloween to seal his mission even 13 years later is going to be obsessed with revenge and how Pettigrew is the worst thing since Voldemort himself. He also squeaks out every single line. He can just say stuff, scream, whisper, not just squeak.

*** I think a lot of what you wrote is honestly what I've been thinking for a long time and I was nodding the whole time I was reading it!

I do want to note with the Peter part of your comment that I also find it quite unreasonable for them to talk shit about him in their wills yet still trust him to be the secret keeper. I read a story recently which instead left a note in the will about them knowing that Peter would rather give his life than give them up as a reason for not leaving him anything monetary or otherwise and it's honestly the best way I've seen it put so far.

**** Peter Pettigrew fascinates me, how can someone be so pathetic that they spend twelve years as a rat /voluntarily/, and also snivel and beg at his friends' feet? He didn't even have the self-respect as to flee elsewhere, or hell, even resurface immediately after Sirius is arrested and claim he has managed to apparate just as Sirius blasted the twelve muggles. He instead chooses to live as the lowliest of animals - a stinky rat.

It's obvious Rowling really tried to portray him as slow, stupid and generally pathetic since he was young (SWM), but his actions generally point otherwise, as do his friends'. He was not as talentless as she intended him to be, nor was he as slow as we were led to initially believe. I read a theory once where he became a Death Eater because he sensed Voldemort was winning, and someone offered him his friends' safety should he indeed take over entirely, but he was tricked into being a spy and was too far gone by the time he started leaking the secrets of the Order.

*** All of this!

Also the idea that James and Sirius did badly in school and Remus was the genius. All three might have been very good academically, but James and Sirius are specifically the ones who say that the OWLs are so easy for them they don't need to study for them. And to add to unsupported tropes about Sirius; making him short and needy and clingy and vain as a teenager, I feel like I encounter this way too much in fanfic. He seems the opposite from the short glimpses we get in canon. Also the idea that he somehow still shares some Black family values or love for his old family after running away.

Especially second the stuff you wrote about Peter, there must have been a lot more to his character for them to trust him like they did.

**** Yes to Sirius and James being geniuses/prodigies! I was on a crusade to prove that when I first joined, but I've toned it down a bit. I also made an entire post about how Sirius is so misinterpreted, because he's my favourite character in the series, despite reading it so many years ago, he's got such a rich backstory.

#+begin_quote
  also the idea that he somehow still shares some Black family values or love for his old family after running away.
#+end_quote

I do not think for a second that he consciously agreed with some of whatever his family's values are, but subconsciously? Maybe, who knows. Something like intelligence being valued, or hell, even loyalty might've started in his family. Regulus was implied to have been loyal to his family first (he told Kreacher not to tell anyone about his dying, which would make sense if he didn't want to hurt how their perceived him as their son).

Sirius, for a guy whose main value seems to be loyalty to others, is so interesting because he runs away from the place which most people fortunate enough to have a good one are loyal to first and foremost. Which is family, but I don't think for a moment he'd be arm in arm with Narcissa if he was cleared. Or having drinks with Bellatrix in the Leaky Cauldron...yeah, no.

I also like to believe he loved Regulus, who was his brother after all (but maybe it's because I'm way too involved in a character that died at 18). Also, I'm the biggest Blackpool fan, which is the best portrayal of Sirius and Regulus's brotherhood I've ever seen.

***** I agree with all you wrote, really! His values as a young person is difficult to know for sure, of course, and pre school age would have been influenced a lot by his family. I think the way he talks in OotP about finally having enough of their opinions and running away from home speaks to him being quite far removed from them in all ways by that point, and for some reason it irks me when it isn't portrayed that way (my way..?) in fanfic.

I absolutely adore the Divine Comedian, I keep checking their page occasionally to see if there's anything new! Blackpool was such a good read, so many great storylines and characterisation is very close to what I imagine in my head for all of them.

****** I agree that Sirius isn't really on good terms with his family but to be honest, I'm also not really a fan of Sirius who springs out of the womb sprouting pro-muggle speech. He was a little rebellious even as a child through Snape's memories but I think James's friendship as well as being friends with a werewolf and the war, all factored into his worldviews, which is a nice transition of him being Draco-like youth to become the Sirius we know in the books, and the one who eventually runs away. Andromeda being disowned would also pile up, I think. There was a good theory about how Sirius wouldn't really be enthusiastic about his friend being a werewolf, but his common sense eventually overrides his prejudice and he accepts him, even he didn't outwardly reject him initially.

The Divine Comedian and the authors of renascentia, as well as Izzythehut are all wonderful writers. Lyin and cupid-painted-blind are as well, I love all their works. Lady Altair has an interesting Sirius but she's sadly known only for Cauterize and while it's brilliant, she's got so many other wonderful works as well. Regulus is written so well by TDC, they manage to make me love a character we barely know anything about at all.

******* I would have loved more flashbacks from JKR about the Marauders. Sirius's upbringing in particular, he just has such a fascinating background. I liked the very short story she wrote about James and Sirius escaping muggle police on the motorbike, but it didn't really give us much more information on them as people. A canon telling on how the other three found out Remus is a werewolf would be cool.

Lyin is actually one of my favourites as well! I've kept up with renascentia and the other one they have, too, and I did start on Izzythehut, liked the first part but quit during the second one. That's actually a characterisation of Sirius that I disliked once his family moved in with him. Bit unreasonable probably, but I just couldn't see him letting slip important secrets and bowing to their wishes the way he did. I know it gets recommended a lot and obviously the writing and the story telling was great. Will definitely check out Lady Altair, I've only read Cauterize and that's a long time ago as well. Thanks for the recs!

My favourites characterisations (besides TDC) of the whole lot of them are probably Into the Fire by wilteddaisy or Anthem for Doomed Youth by Lucyintheskye, both on AO3. They contain wolfstar, though :)

******** I'd have also loved more flashbacks, and something about their era being set in the 70s entirely is so appealing (imagine Lupin in flares) to me, as well as the centre of the war, when it was at its worst. But the thing is we only ever get /Snape's/ flashbacks, which makes it so biased, I'd have loved to see their normal interactions from day-to-day. The short story Rowling wrote gives me life, the way she made Sirius and James so in sync reminded me of Fred and George, and it wasn't an accident she did that. Part of me wants a series about them, and the other part is afraid of what she'd deliver, since I have a certain headcanon that has become so ingrained in my mind about them. Seeing none of Lily's friends is also a huge bummer (also, what did Avery and Mulciber do to Mary Macdonald?).

I can understand how you wouldn't like Izzythehut, but by her own admission she wrote this because she wanted a happy ending for Sirius, and so giving him everything he didn't have is a natural thing (family, a love interest, a chance at living). The premise is intriguing, and I often wonder how different Sirius would be had he been a Slytherin.

I generally dislike Wolfstar, except for TDC's characterisation, so I think I'm going to look into the ones you recommended as well, thanks! =)

********* Good point about the Fred and George link! Lupin in flares would be a yes from me. If she ever does write more Potter I really hope it's Marauders era, I feel like there are so many big events we get parts of (the 'prank') or hints of (like the Mulciber/Mary thing) and just the outbreak of the war in general that could be fleshed out. I'm extra curious about how she would write Peter, but also to get a more three-dimensional Lily would be interesting.

Izzythehut is a very good writer, I won't argue with that! :)

No worries if it's not what you're into. There's a lot of both low and high quality writing with that pairing, but I feel like it does attract some older writers who can create great stories as well. These two are both very funnily written and plotty but have dark themes and definitely some mature content. I like that they both have a bit of the absurd, fun sides of magic and as beforementioned great characterisation of the whole ensemble.

I'd also love a more 3D Lily, everyone seems to be split on the Hermione/Ginny side of things about how her personality was, it'd be cool to see what type of person she actually was, but I'm convinced she was supposed to be more like Tonks and Ginny mashup of sorts.

I think she could have some of Tonks in her for sure. She seems quite snappy and sure of herself in Snape's memories, but since she was given a willow wand that changes things as it's supposedly a wand wood for people with hidden insecurities... Who knows.

************ Ohhhhh, doesn't Ron have a willow wand too? Is that supposed to be Rowling drawing similarities between them? It wouldn't be the first time she does so; they're even both gingers, and Ron is really, really kind, as we're led to believe Lily was. Ron is tall and gangly and as Harry looks into the Mirror of Erised he sees many people with 'knobbly knees', could Harry have inherited something other than her eyes? And Petunia is very tall supposedly, so Lily is probably as well (that makes so much more sense than Ginny = Lily).

What do you think? Now I have to reread everything to try and find the parallelism.

************* Oh yes you're right, his second wand (and the one that chose him) is willow! Wandlore seems quite important, so in this case there definitely should be parallells between them.

Ron is a very loyal friend despite all the problems that comes with being Harry's best friend, and Lily was a very loyal to Snape up until she couldn't look the other way anymore. So that would be one thing.

Lily could definitely be tall or at least gangly and skinny, that could very well be a family trait from her side as much as from James's side. I've never imagined her that way, but I don't think it's ever spelled out in the books, just that Harry looks a lot like James, same height etc. But maybe red hair and freckles is enough as a visual parallell.

Since Petunia is described (like Ron) as secretly insecure and jealous of Lily it never entered my head that Lily might be like that too, but it could be that she is insecure, maybe of Snape because he is better at potions than her, or maybe even jealous at James if he was as brilliant at magic as he seems. I think it could work with the dynamic we see, even though again it's different than what I've been imagining.

"Willow is an uncommon wand wood with healing power, and I have noted that the ideal owner for a willow wand often has some (usually unwarranted) insecurity, however well they may try and hide it. While many confident customers insist on trying a willow wand (attracted by their handsome appearance and well-founded reputation for enabling advanced, non-verbal magic) my willow wands have consistently selected those of greatest potential, rather than those who feel they have little to learn. It has always been a proverb in my family that he who has furthest to travel will go fastest with willow."

************** Being a muggleborn in the first war could also definitely factor into her insecurity, especially, as you say, if Snape was indeed better than her at potions. I've always thought of Lily as a more hard-working version of Harry, although still laid-back, so while smart and powerful in her own right, she gets distracted too, and might decide to skip History of Magic to spare herself Binns's droning. Interested in what interests her (potions, possibly charms if her wand is anything to go by), while the rest is kind of brushed aside other than DADA. If this actually comes back to her as a huge point for insecurity, it would make for an interesting careless Lily, which I rarely see. Okay but looking back, James should be the more responsible of the two (dude managed to stay top of his class with Sirius, became an animagus, was a Quidditch chaser, worked the marauder's map, and was also kind of like Fred and George). That requires so much time management, so these four must've been organised with their time so much to pull all of this, at least Sirius and James.

I also find it interesting that Lily gets sorted into Gryffindor the moment the hat brushes her hair, she obviously is very much one. That's why I also love drawing parallels with her and Harry. While her son is everything a Gryffindor embodies positively, Harry is also reckless and brash at times, which I can definitely see Lily being. I love the idea of how everyone seems to think James and Sirius are Gryffindor reincarnate, but no, it's actually Lily that has all that brazen glory.

As far as physical parallelism goes, Lily has dark auburn hair and Ron bright orange, and she's never described with freckles. And ah, of course, the eyes that only she and Harry are allowed to have.

Interesting that willow wands have healing power, as I've always seen Lily either as a healer or a journalist (imagine the flame wars between her and Rita Skeeter if she had lived, the constant back and forth headlines, glorious). I've also headcanoned her as a Hit Wizard, because auror seems like a more FBI kind of job which requires Kingsley type of deep calm, while Hit Wizards get the action, so with the image of Lily I have in mind with the quintessential Gryffindor (she was, after all, sorted immediately), she'd always be up for a good fight and wants to live in the moment.

Also, this question has been lingering on my mind: do you think Sirius purposefully sent Snape to die, or just wanted to scare him senseless? We don't have much to go on, but with a darker Sirius, I actually prefer the former, although the later seems more canonically likely.

*************** Yes Lily is usually written as the hard-working, studious one and James as the opposite, but it doesn't work with what we know of them. Clearly he had loads of extracurriculars, and was top of the class, so either he must have been one of those lucky people who only need 3 hours of sleep a day, or he had already studied a lot before coming to Hogwarts, maybe knew all of the basics and was naturally good at understanding magic and needed less time to learn/understand new things than what's average. Maybe a mix of the two. I'm thinking since Lily did become Head Girl she must have had really good grades too, although I also like the idea that choosing a muggle born for Head Girl that year was a political statement from Dumbledore. I also think Lily comes across as chatty and social in the memories we see of her rather than introverted, so i could imagine her joining or even leading study groups, being a bit teachery maybe.

What do you think about James's mother's Hogwarts house? Since he says he wants to go to Gryffindor like his father, that suggests his mother was in a different house? Maybe a very brilliant Ravenclaw who passed on intelligence and thinking outside the box to him?

I like the common fanon idea that Lily from the get-go stood up for her rights as a muggleborn in a hostile climate (Voldemort rising during their school years presumably meant that there was a lot more tension between students from different backgrounds than in Harry's time). I think this is a good explanation for why she was immediately picked for Gryffindor.

I've always imagined Lily with freckles, but you're right that they're never mentioned and unlikely to exist in any great number. Now I feel a bit silly!!

I really like the idea of her as a journalist, more so than healer, although her wand suggests that JKR might have seen her as a future healer. Good in potions would presumably be needed for healing. If she had the type of unflinching morals I'm imagining, I think a rivalry with Rita Skeeter would have been amazing. Great idea!

I'm actually really frustrated about the prank in general and that we don't have all the information and details about it. I'm on the fence about Sirius's intentions, I think it could have been an instance of his family influences and his natural streak of cruelty coming out, but at the same time it's a really huge thing to do and I can't see what he would have gained if Snape had been killed or bitten. I've always imagined he looked down on Snape like someone annoying and lesser than him, not someone he actually cared about enough to hate. Obviously if Snape had been bitten/killed it would have ruined Remus as well, that would have been the other main outcome and I don't think it makes sense for Sirius to want that/be ignorant enough not to realize that would be the outcome. I know kids do terrible things to each other, but he's a bit too old to be acting like there are no consequences for his actions? I don't know what to think.

The other thing that bothers me is why would Snape go there in the first place? He strongly suspected there was a werewolf there before Sirius told him how to get inside and Snape isn't stupid so why would he go and see it and put himself in such enormous danger? It's said in the books that he followed them around and tried to catch them out, and I always assumed this meant that he was trying to get them expelled. Basically he thought they're hiding a werewolf from the rest of the school, including staff, and he will just need proof and then he will get them all expelled. Makes sense to go into the Shack to get proof. But, it's been brought to my attention that Snape saw Madam Pomfrey leading Remus to the Willow before all this happened, which means he must have known that Madam Pomfrey knew about Remus. And if the staff knew and helped protect Remus and Snape knew this, then there is no reason except stupidity for Snape to go see the werewolf, unless he wanted to kill the werewolf. But that doesn't make sense either, Snape wouldn't risk his own school career by killing someone, even if it's someone he hated.

So yes, I'm confused. What are your thoughts?

**************** I've never been a fan of Lily and Lupin as the smart ones, Sirius and James are dumb and dumber, while Peter Pettigrew is a squib. Scratch that, I hate everything popular relating to fanon Marauder's era, including Snape.

The thing is, being Head Boy/Head Girl isn't just because of good grades (someone who might be top of their class can be uninvolved in extracurricular activities or is simply taciturn and unpleasant, they certainly don't deserve the head position, especially if they're unorganised, I've just always found it odd that top student = head boy/girl), but also because of them being a popular person, we know James was loved and Rowling said Lily was 'a bit of a catch', and compared her to Ginny. I definitely agree that it was a political statement, as well as Dumbledore hoping for Lily and James to get together, maybe. The odd thing is neither James nor Lily were prefects!

Oh, I've always headcanoned Euphemia as Ravenclaw, definitely, and Scottish for some reason. One thing I find extremely odd is that James is supposedly very intelligent and while Sirius was the likelier to brew the animagus potion (Slughorn called him talented), James was never mentioned by Slughorn at all. His father was a potioneer after all, and a very famous one, so why not James? I have a little headcanon of them being rivals, and Slughorn passing on the grudge to James (although he may have been admittedly crap at potions), but a Fleamont-Horace rivarly amongst potioneers makes me amused. /Especially/ if Horace was one of the few to mock him for his name in Hogwarts.

I also like the idea of Lily who is an advocate for muggleborns and muggles in general, she's definitely a warrior at heart and must've had a good reason to be so popular among students. I've seen headcanons of her tutoring students and as a result being sort of a mama-bear to the younger student body, which is a wholesome theory.

The prank puzzles me because Snape was stupid and Sirius was so dumb to actually let it slip (he couldn't've possibly ignored Remus, the real victim of the incident, in my opinion). I don't think it was a cold pre-meditated murder, because Snape, as you said, knew that the staff had it under control. On the other hand, I've seen a fanfiction which actually made it just so, with an entire drawing of how to enter and all, dropping it after he saw Snape following him so he could read it, and the turning point for Sirius when he started to mature and realise he was so much like his family in some ways, and running away isn't going to erase an entire upbringing. I like it because it adds even more layers to Sirius, but...damn, what a jerk if that's true.

Snape was an imbecile here, definitely, but aren't Sirius and James even more of that? Because after the prank, they go and levitate him in front of the crowd, because Sirius was bored? What even? I've seen it as revenge for something (nearly always Mary Macdonald and whatever they did to her), and another odd thing is that in that scene, everyone around them was laughing and seemed to think Snape deserved it. Lily was the only one who stood up for him, so he must have been soooo unpopular for that to happen. I do not believe for a second that Lily was the only decent person around to stand up for him. There's a really popular fanfiction where Lily does forgive Snape end of 5th year, although reluctantly, and the Whomping Willow Incident happens beginning of Sixth Year, and Snape slips up again somehow, so she cuts it off altogether then (which is most often set in September-November 1976). That does undermine from Lily herself, however.

Snape also invented levicorpus, so how did James manage to use it on him if Snape didn't cast it on somebody else before, or even (most likely, given his hatred of him, James himself or one of his mates)? That doesn't put Snape in a good light, at all, nor does sectumsempra. Apparently, the spell was so popular during their time at Hogwarts that everyone knew about it. Snape must've really gone and put it on whoever annoyed him, but why then, didn't Lily mention it in flashbacks?

On a more light-hearted note, do you think Sirius played Quidditch? I've seen him as a beater more times than I could count, and sometimes as a keeper. Although once, he was a seeker and played against Regulus, and was a very heated match between both brothers.

***************** I like your idea about a Slughorn/Fleamont rivalry!!

I think one thing that fanon understates in pretty much every story is James's popularity amongst other students and teachers. We get it plainly from Lupin saying that James and Sirius "were the best in the school at whatever they did - everyone thought they were the height of cool" (OotP), from professors remembering them fondly, Dumbledore being genuinely worried about how powerful Sirius is before we find out the truth about him in PoA, and as you say from the scene in Snape's worst memory. (As an aside, i've always thought Snape's worst memory is the scene that comes after, when Lily ends their friendship). The thing about the hexing Snape in front of the school scene, is that even Lily apparently finds it amusing. There's "Lily, whose furious expression had twitched for an instant as though she was going to smile" just after Snape is hauled up by his ankles and his robes fall down. I don't know if this is the generational difference showing (maybe this would have been unanimously funny in JKR's time and our sense of what is a fun prank has changed) or if she just put it in to show that Lily was already developing some warmer feelings for James. But yeah, I think there's a chance that JKR meant to write a funny scene with a dark undertone, but how it's been interpreted by pretty much every reader is that James and Sirius are completely out of line and not very funny at all.

I think the war is relevant when it comes to who the popular and unpopular kids were. I'm assuming James and Sirius might have been very outspokenly anti-Voldemort and it's possible that they might have protected younger or less talented kids from the mini-Death Eaters at Hogwarts (I think this would be the easiest way to explain their popularity to be honest). Snape is consistantly said to be very into the Dark Arts, could have been mainly academically, but we hear from Lily (and maybe also from Sirius in GoF?) that he hangs out with people who were aiming to be/became Death Eaters at least from fifth year onwards. I think that if there was a general bias against Voldemort, then this explains some of Snape's unpopularity. Usually in fanon we see lots of students agreeing with Death Eaters, but if they were a much smaller faction it would work better with canon (as I see it). This group grew larger and larger until Voldemort's downfall, but around the time for the prank and their OWL's, the general consesus was strongly anti-Voldemort.

Lily's blindness where Snape is concerned is fascinating, but I believe JKR wrote it like this on purpose. I believe there's a lot of at least anecdotal evidence of for instance black women dating members of the KKK, where both parties explain away the issues and say they're not that bad or their partner is an exception. I think this is what happened, psychologically speaking, until Snape finally slipped up and called Lily a slur.

The whole school seems to know that James saved Snape's life, which Lily mentions outside of the portrait hole when they talk. This would add to Snape's hatred of James and it would explain why everyone is still on the Marauders side afterwards (although we of course have precious little to go on here). Snape also seems to still believe, fifteen years later in PoA, that they were all in on the prank, not just Sirius. I feel like there are bits missing from what we the readers know.

I looked up what Sirius says in PoA about the prank (or 'trick' is the word Lupin uses to describe it): "It served him right," he sneered. "Sneaking around, trying to find out what we were up to... hoping he could get us expelled..."

What I take away from that is that he thought and still thinks that he didn't do anything wrong. I suppose from his point of view it all turned out ok? Remus wasn't hurt in the end and Snape maybe stopped following them around after this? I find this a bit difficult to reconcile with Sirius's character as it's otherwise written. And I still don't understand how Snape would be stupid enough to go and visit a known werewolf during the full moon. So yeah, I choose to believe that there is some info missing :)

I don't think we're told eplicitly that Snape invented all of those hexes, although it definitely is implied. The book he wrote them in belonged to his mother first and he could have copied some of them from a book on charms. Sectumsempra I believe he says he invented when he runs away from Harry. But likely he invented them all and used them a lot or taught them to other people, mini-Death Eaters or even Lily. Then the levicorpus one became fashionable and everyone was using it, according to Lupin, even though it wasn't known that it was Snape's spell originally.

I don't think Sirius played quidditch, at least not for any length of time. I think he would have told Harry if he had. I like the idea of him being a quidditch commentator, though, which I've seen a few times as well as beater, I think he has the sort of crude, dry sense of humour that would make it quite funny.

****************** There's so many aspects of the Marauders' Era that's really undermined by the fandom, so the fact that James was really popular shouldn't be a surprise, but it always is, apparently. The fact that McGonagall and Flitwick remembered Sirius fondly in The Three Broomsticks even when she believed he was a mad mass murderer, speaks volumes of how endearing he and James were. Madam Rosmerta also calls them funny (never failed to make me laugh), so while Sirius had a drier sense of humour from what we see in the books, James must have had balanced him out.

People also seem to have a misconception that Sirius and James mistrusted Dumbledore so much. If they did, why the hell would they fight on his behalf and in his Order (with corny matching t-shirts)? You're right, Snape's Worst Memory is just a title, albeit a very recognisable title in this fandom. Funny how we seem to remember chapter titles and forget important details. Lily might have had a more slapstick sense of humour, maybe? But actually, pantsing is very popular in boarding schools apparently, so she must have got it from there.

I don't subscribe to the belief that Lily hated James and suddenly started loving him; it's so cheap. Nor am I a fan of a cat and mouse game between them both, with Lily always slapping away James since their First Year. Again, he was 'the height of cool'. No person who's the height of cool can be such an obsessive, drooling mess. I also agree that their outspokenness against Voldemort would've played a huge part in how they were popular. Sirius also being a rebel from a most likely abusive family

You bring up a good point about generational things because everyone seems to think Sirius and James were feminists. Feminism was a really controversial thing back then if I remember correctly, and no 'height of cool' students would be caught dead saying that. I can see Lily as a feminist. However, the issue is that it's a muggle thing; Wizarding social issues are so much more different than muggle ones. Not once in the series do I remember someone underestimating a girl in terms of ability, because magic does get rid of the usual things such as physical strength (why discriminate if both a man and woman can levitate a heavy boulder, for example?). I don't believe that the Death Eaters were such a small faction, mainly because you don't have to be so outspoken against a very racist minority mainly found in Slytherin, and to escalate to such levels of hatred. So I tend to think that the stigma around muggleborns wasn't inherently racist, it's just that so many were being killed that associating with them is considered bad luck, so people avoided it. That makes more sense with the whole nazi youth vs opposing sides, with being more equal.

I see Lily giving Snape so many chances as her being biased towards him. Her friends cannot understand why she speaks to him, so that just reinforces the fact that he was extremely unpopular as a classmate, and unlike other claims, he wasn't forced into being a Death Eater. What makes it sadder is that Lily tells him she detests Avery and Mulciber, and the later is creepy. She doesn't want to acknowledge the fact that her association with Snape is seen just as detestable and creepy, although she may know it, maybe she doesn't want to confront it? I think Lily might have thought she could be a good influence on him, but she ultimately failed, through no fault of her own, but Snape's entirely. But that makes it so extremely one-sided as a friendship, and I don't like to believe someone as strong as Lily would've stuck around for over five years for nostalgia's sake. So Snape has some redeeming qualities, or Lily herself isn't as faultless as she seems (for example, she might not have split her time equally between her supposed best friend and other friends).

I think Snape is pathetic as Lupin says, to cling onto a grudge over two decades ago, even if he was bad, but wow, live life man and move on. I mean, Sirius had so much more reason to dwell on it than you, what with being emotionally traumatised and all. It isn't the fact that he shouldn't be traumatised, but more like, don't act petulant, you're 34. There's also the fact that Lupin thinks Snape was jealous of James's Quidditch talent, and we later see him complaining to Lily about him being a 'big Quidditch hero', and a girl laughing at him for falling off it. I forgot that the whole school knows about James saving Snape's life, how do you think that circulated? Portraits, perhaps? Peter made a point to tell everyone about it?

Oh, Sirius being seemingly remorseless can be explained by some information missing, especially when Remus has forgiven him so quickly, but we also have to remember that Sirius is not very emotionally stable at the moment, he's obsessed with killing Peter and he's being extremely bitter, so naturally, an incident concerning his school rival will just make him angrier, and he'll feel remorseless. Or, as you said, some information is missing (which I choose to believe). Snape was unbelievably idiotic to actually follow through his instructions but the way Lupin said it is a bit odd. He says 'Sirius played a trick'. A trick makes it seem like he hid this information as something else. He didn't imperius him obviously, but he also didn't tell him how to go, as is the most common interpretation. Maybe he saw Snape overhearing him talk to James/Peter/Remus, and decided to say something about the willow? Or, maybe a drawing? I like this because it makes both Snape and Sirius equally to blame, and both very idiotic and, well, teenagers. Something I like about the series is the very realistic depiction of young people, even the mature one, Hermione, actually traps and blackmails Rita. Thats extremely reckless.

What bugs me is that Snape actually invents his own spells, and he also improves potions recipes, but Sirius and James still top the class. Either he didn't concentrate on schoolwork, or Sirius and James were equally innovative (I mean, brewing the animagus potion, the mirrors, the map, I can believe they invented their own spells). I do have a headcanon that everything on the potions book was actually Eileen Prince's doing (except the spells), and that she tutored both Lily and Snape. And for Sirius and James to be ‘top in everything', either they innovate on their own or use Fleamont's advice and own little tricks. It's definitely implied that at their level they at least must have some sort of innovation in potions, as Slughorn seems to think they must do. It just goes back to Harry's year being generally below average. I like Eileen Prince as a wasted potential. Or maybe flip it around: Sirius and James use Fleamont's advice, Snape was the innovator. Either way, some characters fascinate me like Regulus Black and Eileen Prince, that we have basically nothing about. Prince seems to have been a distinguished family for Snape to be wanted to be known as one, then why, pray tell, did Eileen go marry a muggle? And he was also abusive as hell to her. Being a witch, you'd think she could just blast him to pieces and vanish the evidence, the muggles would be none the wiser. She was also neglectful of Snape, as Rowling constantly pointed out in the memories. Why bring a child into the world then? And she can easily run off with Snape and both have a more comfortable life elsewhere. Everything about Snape's childhood and Eileen is just so sad.

Sirius as a Quidditch commentator is also the closest thing I find Sirius being related to Quidditch, and some one-shots I've ready about it are hilarious, and do use his crude sense of humour. I've lost the titles, however, which is a real shame ;(

  Also the idea that James and Sirius did badly in school and Remus was the genius. All three might have been very good academically, but James and Sirius are specifically the ones who say that the OWLs are so easy for them they don't need to study for them

Not to mention the things they do for fun while they're in school - become animagi, devise and enchant the Marauder's Map, enchant mirrors to be able to communicate with each other, enchant a bike to fly...and this is just from off-hand comments by Remus and Sirius. Also, in SWM, James casts Levicorpus silently after Snape cuts his cheek, which is supposed to be sixth-year stuff.

Not to mention that James&Lily and Frank&Alice fought Voldemort three separate times each and thwarted him all three times - without the use of stupid Deus-ex machina. The way the prophecy is worded and how Dumbledore speaks of their feats certainly lends itself to the idea that the confrontations were direct fights, not just foiling plans or saying no to recruitment offers or similar stuff.

** It really depends, because for every one I'm about to mention there's at least one story I love that includes the trope. However, currently, here's what I'm tired of:

Idiot/Abusive Ron - dude has his flaws, yeah, but I think the focus on making him a jealous idiot, an abusive partner, or a lazy slob is overdone at this point and misses the very great opportunity to focus on his actual flaws, which honestly make for a far better story even if you want him to be the bad guy. (Hermione leaving him because he was hitting her? This does not spark joy. Hermione leaving him because she got tired of his condescending attitude towards things she likes that he doesn't? This sparks joy!)

dom!Draco - Like the earlier comment said, just...ehhhh no. I know, I know, can't judge a book by it's cover and all that, but I can't see Draco as being a remotely functional dom unless it's way post war and he's had a lot of growing up time. Honestly, he really gives me mouthy bottom/pillow princess vibes - the effort that goes into topping, much less the responsibility that goes into domming, just don't seem like they fit canon Draco.

sexgod!Harry - This boy is so fucking bad at interacting with people he's attracted to and so very uncomfortable or oblivious about people attracted to him. Maybe he grows up and grows out of it?

Helping this is that we don't know characters' inner lives, and only see them from the bias of one character's perspective. Maybe Hermione really is just repressed and needs the right person/situation to let loose, for example.

What tends to get me most are when characters are given traits that are completely opposed to their core canonical character traits. Like evil/asshole Harry, kind father figure Snape, evil!Weasley parents.

And I think that arc is needed for someone like her vs someone like say Riddle or Snape who you already know would be good at something like that.

As for the politician bit I thought that was cursed child? And people have mixed feelings on cursed child being canon.

******* Hermione being Minister for Magic was on Pottermore far before Cursed Child.

Also, Snape was far more awkward than Hermione - and never managed to become a sociable person. Evne when he asked Dumbledore for help, he made the other look at him in disgust for not caring about Harry and James, only Lily.

******** Im not sure thats a good comparison. Snape is spy smooth talking comes with the job a bit. He did have to convincingly have to put on a act for death eaters and Voldy. While some like Bellatrix were wary he was largely convincing and successful.

He isn't a very sociable person in general though. He's mostly a grumpy asshole to the students. But thats a choice he doesn't have to he a dick he maliciously chooses to be. He knows he's being cruel when he says he sees no difference when Hermione has enormous buck teeth that hit the floor. Course he sees a difference.

When he comes to tell Dumbledore bout Lilly you could argue he's just dumping out his desperate plea not caring about being nuanced about it. But even when Dumbledore is disgusted he's like fine save em all then hide them all. I don't think he cared much if the desire to save only Lilly was perceived as repulsive as long as she was saved and telling Dumbledore was his best bet.

Hermione on the other hand has plenty of insensitive moments but they often come from being unable to understand how someone else would react to the situation. When Lavender for example looses her rabbit shes crying about how she should have seen it coming cuz Trawleny predicted it.

Hermione points out how really she didn't predict it accurately as she sees it as important to not give Trawleny credit she doesn't deserve and convince others along the way too possibly. It doesn't seem to occur to her its insensitive and unhelpful to bring it up while Lavender's crying about her dead pet.

This is repeated with the house elf incident where Hermione knows that most house elves see getting clothes as a insult. She's confused as to why but she sees them get offended at the concept. So unless she changes their perspective on that forcing clothes on them will backfire. Which it does when she doesn't take that into account and tries to trick them into getting clothes.

She's direct in her approach not really taking people's emotional state into account in her approach. Contrast this with Snape who absolutely did when he made the comment bout Hermione's teeth. Or when he mocked Neville in front of Lupin. He is aware of their emotions and how he is being perceived in that moment but he just doesn't care. Doesn't mean he's always successful but its kinda the basics of what you need to be that smooth talker type in my opinion . The Tom Riddlesque manipulative mastermind.

And book canon Hermione struggles with that in my opinion. Its kinda a character beat for her. A bit of a subversion of the girls being good at understanding other peoples emotional state trope I think. That doesn't mean she can't get there but because its a struggle for her. Making a AU where she good at with no arc showing how she got over it because she's smart seems like its not really taking Hermione'es unique qualities into account. Most I've seen just accept shes good at it now no arc needed. Which bothers me. Same with the smart people can do all the things trope.

********* Snape utterly fucked up his friendship with Lily. That's not the act of someone who is in any way, shape or form better at socialising than Hermione at the same age. He was thoroughly manipulated by the Death Eaters as a teenager at the time Hermione formed the DA. Of course by the time he was older he had made some progress and grew better at it - but at that age, Hermione was the Minister for Magic.

********** Snape fucked up his friendship with Lilly because he was a bigot but was trying to sell it as its ok cuz I like you. All the bad things about muggleborns i think are ok cuz you're the exception and expected that to be ok, while openly being friends with people trying to be death eaters and trying to be a death eater himself, which Lilly knew. Its actually kinda shocking their friendship lasted for as long as it did. Which might actually be due to in my opinion Snape being adept at presenting himself and their relationship in a particular way.

Maybe it could be seen as he has a socialization problem in part if he had no other friends. But he did have other friends ( the then future death eaters) and his issues didn't stem from being bad at expressing himself or being accidentally insensitive like Hermione's did in canon. They came from him siding with a supremacist hate group that wanted to shit on muggleborns which Lilly was. This is not a poor people skills issue. You can be a bigot and have good people skills.

And there is no point in the books any indication that joining the death eaters was something Snape was minipulated into rather than wanting to join. Despite the fact the Rowling had that pensive segment trying to make you better understand Snape in book 7 not every death eater was explored very much. You dont know their story or why they joined. Maybe some were forced. But I believe Snape is explored enough that if he were canonically forced or manipulated into joining it would be referenced.

He doesn't even have Draco's issue of being raised by Death Eaters to hate and then befriending other death eater apologists to make him worse. While Snape's upbringing made him biased towards muggles it didn't to muggleborns. Yet he grows to hate them too despite his friendship with Lilly. He had exposure to a alternate perspective that was easily accessible to him but he doesn't take it till much later in life.

This to me indicates that he made poor decisions and embraced problematic philosophies without a outside force pushing him towards it. Not that this makes him beyond redemption here but his decisions in this moment aren't under duress or a result of lack of exposure to any alternate form of thinking.

But socialization isn't really the debate here its being the manipulative silver tongued genius trope. Which politicians aren't necessarily by default . I wouldn't say any previous Minister you see , including Shacklebolt who is the last in book series, has been.

So Hernione being minister doesn't make her an example of that trope either in canon. She is however that trope plenty of times in fic, many set with her in school with no explanation as to why beyond her being smart, despite all the reasons that she'd find that difficult to be automatically given her canon struggles. Which I find ooc.

************ He does know. Thats why when she initially accuses him of being friends with people who use dark magic like Avery and Mulciber he tries to paint it as not a big deal and then gets defensive.

He in fact is very good at changing the subject which shows in my opinion he's very good at controlling the conversation so he doesn't have to address his behavior which I'd say requires a decent understanding of how Lilly reacts to things. Its not that he doesn't understand her feelings on the subject its that as long as he gets his way he doesn't really care. This is further hammered in when Dumbledore says you disgust me he says

" You do not care, then, about the deaths of her husband and child? They can die, as long as you can have what you want?"

Snape does not deny it just amends the statement to keep them all safe because that will ensure she stays safe.

" Hide them all, then" he croaked. " Keep her --- them --- safe". Please".

This is very different from Hermione who just does not consider how her words would effect Lavender for example in the Trawleny example. It just doesn't automatically occur to her.

Snape though does. He's actively defending what Lilly's vocally telling him is upsetting and why it is. He does understand he just doesn't care.

But again this is not about Snape its about Hermione not canonically being the manipulative silver tongued genius trope. How she has struggles in canon illustrating that she wouldn't easily find a way to be that trope because she's not the best at anticipating and accounting for emotions of others which is kinda a necessity for that trope and while she could learn that would need an arc you often do not get in many fics that have this version of Hermione. Which is why I personally find it ooc even if you don't. It is possible for you to have a different interpretation of Hermione and thats fine. But based on mine it makes that depiction of her without a arc pretty ooc.

************* I disagree about Snape being skilled at social interaction. Also, comparing him in year 5 to Hermione in year 3 is not really valid - Hermione changes over the course of the seven years at Hogwarts.

One of the worst tropes is the idea that characters remain the same from 11 to 18.

************** Well i suppose it depends on what you mean by skilled. I think he is able to understand the emotions of others and able to usually present a version of himself he wants to project and is aware how he is being perceived. He is also able to use that awareness to his advantage when needed and thats what made him a great spy in my opinion. If thats being skilled at social interaction then yes i think he is. Doesn't mean he's perfect at it he does mess up especially in intense situations like in that worst memory scene. But that doesn't mean he's incapable of censoring himself when needed or unable to socialize in normal circumstances.

Now if you meant like forming healthy relations with people and being open and honest and not having toxic harmful behaviors then no. He isn't not in most circumstances you see him in. But I would say neither is Voldemort. In the past though you see he's capable of managing other peoples perception of him using that to get himself closer to what he wants.

And Voldemort is kind of the archetype that I'm talking about. When he's younger at least from what you see.

So when I say skilled at social stuff thats what I'm talking about and those are the qualities I don't think Hermione has alot of in the books.

Hermione did indeed change she for example did function much better under stress in book 7 than book 1. And I do think she appears to overall accidentally upset people less often. However I will still say that its a struggle for her. There are certain tendencies a character may have in say year 1 of a story.

Then lets say you time skip to year 3 and that character has changed by following through on what was set up. So while you may have not seen the whole development you saw the seeds of what they became post time skip. At no point in my opinion does Hermione become this manipulative mastermind.

Nor does she in my opinion have the seeds of something that will result in her becoming that archetype based on canon. Its not the natural growth not from my perspective. She does get better at doing things like not accidentally offending people but thats not enough to say she's now good at managing people like Voldemort was. You could argue she gets a sorta ruthless streak maybe there's definetly a precedent there. Figuring things out for sure. Finding ways of dealing with problems efficiently absolutely. But excelling in situations that require accounting for someone else's emotional state to get what she wants ? Not so much. Not in my opinion.

So for that archetype to make sense for Hermione in fanfic I would need some kinda arc or reason or set up or something illustrating why Hermione would suddenly be good at this sort of thing when she wasn't in the books. Especially if you are covering the same time period ( years 1-8). And I don't always really get that beyond she's just smart. Which isn't really a good explanation and makes her seem ooc.

Its not about being stagnant but having character growth that makes sense.
