Jacob Prewett learns his ancestors were wizards and goes to live with the Weasleys during the summer before a Chamber of Secrets so they can show him the magical world before he joins Hogwarts with Ginny and is put in Gryffindor. Being the son of a squib and a muggle he is hated by most of the other great wizard families and his main goals are to help bring Voldemort's downfall, restore his House's wealth, prestige and respect and to help squibs and muggleborn to find a place in the society he wants to create.


** I don't know if you were aware, but Rowling had originally intended for Mafalda Prewett (the daughter of the Squib accountant) to start her first-year in GoF and be sorted into Slytherin.

** I never wrote anything before and had this idea some days ago when I was bored. Should I try to write it or would it be uninteresting and not worth to read?
