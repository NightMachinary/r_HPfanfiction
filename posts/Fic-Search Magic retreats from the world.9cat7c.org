Hi, I am looking for a fic where the Trio is discussing an article by Skeeter. She writes that Wizards put sensors on muggle spacecraft and while some years ago the sensors did record magic even far away from earth now the magic just barely covers Earth anymore. Hermione is quite emotional about just finding out about magic before it vanishes and Ron thinks Skeeter‘ article is bullshit.

Thanks for you answers


** Chapter 6 of Dragon Lily has something of the sort.

  In the seventies some French Ministry wizards snuck a monitoring device - like a sneakoscope only it detects the potential for powerful magic on board a spaceship muggles had sent to Mars. Which means at some point between Mars and Earth magic ceases to exist.

  But this time the spacecraft itself failed before it reached half of the distance the previous instrument had covered. Which means the nexus is getting weaker and smaller.
