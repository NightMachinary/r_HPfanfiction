  A chance remark on the night of Halloween 1981 could have changed everything. Fate throws baby Harry into the custody of Kingsley Shacklebolt, assisted by a certain Mad-Eye Moody. And oh boy, heads will roll and history will change when this gets out. Dear Wizarding Britain: Your saviour has arrived.

** linkffn(7985679)

Appears to be abandoned, sadly. Worth a read, regardless. It's hilarious.

** Highly unlikely to happen except in time travels.

It might be interesting if Harry and Ron became 11 years old again and decided to join Slytherin house to shake things up there. Hermione was most likely dead in the first timeline and her death should be the primary reason Harry and Ron risked a time travel.

In my plot, Dumbledore and Snape would be cooperative and was let in their plans right from the start. So they got down right to business and accomplished a lot in their first months, such as freeing Sirius, neutralizing Malfoy, outing Barty Jr, eliminating the Lestranges, and getting every Horcrux except Harry's scar. But they were unable to capture Voldemort who successfully escaped Quirrell's body.

However, their emotional states were still in shambles. On top of finishing off Voldemort, they might lose their previous loves (Hermione, Ginny, Luna, Susan, Daphne), and because they changed the timeline so much, unexpected new enemies emerged.

** I don't see this happening unless it's a time travel fic or something. Ron has grown up disliking Slytherin and wouldn't join it just for one friend he met on the train.

*** Which would theoretically make such a story interesting. Why would ron follow harry? Maybe he decides to be the hero and "save" harry from the slytherins, maybe it's not as strong a dislike as in canon allowing friendship to trump his own desires. Regardless, it's a bit odd in a request thread to tell someone their desired alternate universe fanfiction isn't canon compliant.

*** It can be as simple as wanting to make his own way as a weasely from his brothers and parents. Same reason as some Slytherin Ginny fics

** Linkffn(7840508)

Harry Potter and Black Lagoon crossover. Reason is that Ron wants to differentiate himself from his brothers
