/So I found some Really old Challenge prompts that I posted on FFnet yrs ago on a forum and thought that I would share them here. They are outlined a little differently then you might be used to, but take a look. Discuss, ask questions and write./

​

*Plot:*

Purebloods insist that they are more powerful than Halfbloods and Muggle-borns. This is true, but Only because of the sheer amount of Magical knowledge and History the Families collect over the generations. They Chronicle this is a Grimoire or a Book of Shadows, and The Potters are one of the /oldest/ magical lines in Britain.

*Rules: (Tropes/concepts that we MOST encourage be included in Challenge Responses)*

All Affinities Welcome (Dark, Grey, Light, Good, Evil Neutral Harry)

Whatever the Affinity Harry MUST be Powerful

The Potter Grimoire is Sentient, possessing a part of Every Potter that came before - Either Soul or Magic (Think Riddles Diary)

As a Result of the book, Harry must learn Magic that is Different and Stronger than Cannon (Be it OC or Crossover)

Magic from the book is the reason Harry Survived the Killing Curse

Depending on Timing Harry can go into any house

All pairings are Welcome

*Optional Guidelines: (As might be implied, these can be included or discarded by the writers Preferences)*

The Ministry Frowns of the Use of Grimoires or Considers them Dark

Harry performs Rituals to better himself physically or Mentally (ie: Making himself Stronger or Smarter, Giving himself Creature attributes such as accelerated Healing, Reflexes etc...)

Harry Summons Demons

Master of Death Harry

Resorting

Harry Calls on Life Debts

Crossover

Slash (I am a Slasher and Gay man, so Slash is always an acceptable option)

*Forbidden: (I can't Stop you including these Tropes, but if you do I may not read)*

Weak Harry

Nieve Harry

Harry Refusing to use, Giving up or otherwise destroying the Grimoire

Harry/Hermione Pairing (Can't stand it)

Idiot Ron ( Don't have to be BFF's, just not Stupid. So many in Fandom Bash him, I'd like to see some creativity)

​

/I will probably post other challenges with a Similar outline as this in the coming hrs and days/

**** Exactly. As well as, Not /necessarily/ dark but spells not taught at Hogwarts. Forgotten or discouraged by the Ministry because they consider it to be so. It's a common trope in the groups and fic that I read
