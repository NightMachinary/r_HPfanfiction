:END:
(New to Reddit) I'm looking for a fanfic I read a while back, but can't seem to find. Basically something happens(can't remember what, somewhere between year 5-7) and harry is in the Room of Requirement. Hogwarts feels sorry for her favourite child and sends him back in time. He meets Tom Riddle and goes to Slytherin. He and Tom become roommates and later tentative friends. Eventually they fall for each other and yea. Then an attack on Hogsmeade(spellcheck?) Gives a muggle-born the perfect opportunity to get revenge. Harry 'dies' and is sent back to his own time(did I mention he already gave Tom a promise ring?) where he contacts Voldy. Voldy finds him, has an existential crisis for a while, they're back together and Voldy's self-consious about his snake skin. That's the most important stuff, though I think there's also something about Vampire!Harry in there since it's a big bonding point and show of trust between them. It really WAS much better than this and a lot of planning and dedication went in to create proper paradoxes and stuff.

I know this is long but it's a VERY specific fanfic. Any help is appreciated.
