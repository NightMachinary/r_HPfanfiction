Would Patronus messages be able to be delivered to a person inside a building protected by Fidelus? *edit: Specifically if the person sending the Patronus is not privy to the Fidelus location.

Is there any indication of how far away someone can be to deliver a Patronus message? Or how long the message can be?

** Arthur patronus got to Grimmauld place, if I can remember.

*** Good point. Arthur was included in the Fidelus for #12 though. I wonder if it would make a difference if he hadn't been. I edited the op to include a scenario of the "sender" not being privy to the Fidelus location.

**** In that case, I think we have no canon info. But seems like, as with owls, sender doesn't need to know the receivers location. Which could mean the skill to go around fidelius. Can deliver message without needing caster to know the location.

***** That's what I was thinking. I was pretty sure there was no direct canon info that contraindicated it, but the logic about owl post seemed to parallel to a Patronus message in my head, which made me think it could work the same way.
