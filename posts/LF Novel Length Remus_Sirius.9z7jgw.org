** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16126862][Wolf, Wolf]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/felix_atticus/pseuds/sebastianL][sebastianL (felix_atticus)]] - Remus spends his days after /Deathly Hallows/ writing a book and spending time with Sirius, but something about his reality isn't quite right. Pretty much 100000 words of self-hatred and angst, with some flashbacks to the first war. It's in first person, which I tend to avoid, but the writing style fits Remus' narration. It's also rated Explicit, but there isn't really any smut (I'd rate it Mature).

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/583762][Maddest House]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/busaikko/pseuds/busaikko][busaikko]] - Raising Harry in a world where Voldemort didn't vanish for 11 years.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4181253/1/Very-Bad-Things][Very Bad Things]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1461919/freudian-fuckup][freudian fuckup]] - Lighthearted; set during Marauders Era.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1784][Levity]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/rageprufrock/pseuds/rageprufrock][rageprufrock]] - Series of first war fics.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/10350][The Rising Storm]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Rosie_Rues/pseuds/Rosie_Rues][Rosie_Rues]] - Series of Marauders Era fics; includes two Remus/Sirius longfics.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/41159][Beyond the Veil]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Atalan/pseuds/Atalan][Atalan]] - Post-OoTP, Sirius tries to communicate to his friends that he isn't as dead as they think.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1145357][Teenage Kicks]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Soupy_George/pseuds/Soupy_George][Soupy_George]] - Set during the first war; incomplete and hasn't updated for a while, but some arcs are complete.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/927712][Common Woodbrown]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/imochan/pseuds/imochan][imochan]] - Remus raises Harry and realizes Sirius is innocent. More of a Remus character study than a Remus/Sirius romance, but I like the exploration of lycanthropy.

** The Pet is a really great story. Set in a HP universe where Voldemort doesn't seem to exist. Also, werewolves are considered animals and Sirius' Father decides to buy him an unusual pet. There's also a companion story with the whole thing from Remus' point of view.

  Complete. "What were you thinking, Orion---a werewolf? In our home?" "We've discussed this. It's a pet for the children." SBRL. Slight AU, werewolves are considered animals and Ministry property & the Blacks buy their son a very unique pet. Close to canon.
