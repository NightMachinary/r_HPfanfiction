E.g a cat person eats a rat person while both are transformed.


** it all depends on what school of thought you proscribe to regarding transfiguration and animagus's;

- is it a permanent change, in which case the rat would stay a rat and be digested,
- or is it a temporary change, in which case the rat will change back as soon as it dies, which has the potential of exploding the cat depending on the point of death (i.e. is the rat killed by being chewed on, or are they swallowed whilst alive)

**** I've always assumed it means that non-food can't be transfigured into food (e.g. if you turn a brick into a chicken, the chicken wouldn't provide any sustenance if you eat it.)

assuming that logic is true, an animagus would provide sustenance as you're transfiguring something edible (a human) into something else that's edible (a rat).

***** I think you're right, since you'd just be modifying the properties of already existing food. Still magically possible, just in poor taste (pun fully intended).

There's a few fics where it is possible to transfigure one food to another, but it's based upon /your/ interpretation of the taste. So what tastes fine to you would be horrible for others.

**** I think the Gamp's issue is that transfiguring non food eg wood, stone etc into food won't work as it will return to it's element eg if you chew it up into fine pieces instead of whole I believe it will transform back into those smaller pieces of wood or stone. And therefore provide you no nutrition and in fact do you more harm.

Of course, if you consider that if a polyjuiced person dies while in form they stay in that polyjuiced form. So if animagus is eaten by another animagus they won't transform back (if you assume it works the same way).

Regrettably, canon doesn't really help answer tge question as no animagus dies while in their animal form.

**** I mean you transform flesh into other flesh. It's not really like if you transfigured pebbles into berries. You can transfigure a book into a chicken, but if you eat the chicken it will be as if you ate a book.

***** I'm thinking there exists the potential for a fic where the Weasley twins argue with Hermione about this during the summer when they're all at Padfoot's house. Hermione would be right and use facts, like your position, but the twins could troll her and say shit like, "Mum, Dad, did you know that muggles think that people are /food/? Hermione was just telling me!" to get a rise out of her while they're all stuck in the house.

*** Hmmm...\\
From what I got from books, while transformed, the rat is a fully functional animal, with human intelligence being supported by magic, and even that doesn't work perfectly (testimony of one Padfoot), so the result is the same as when a regular cat eats a regular rodent.

However, if no additional magic is involved, it is entirely up to Animagus when the transformation is reversed, causing them to return to their original mass and size. Thus, if conscious, the rat could spitefully return to human form while partially or fully eaten - resulting in bad time for both. If unconscious/dead, all that remains is an ordinary rat.

There are no instances on record of Animagus spontaneously turning human - only at will or when hit by Homorphus charm (?)(Wiki).

**** I don't think the already eaten parts would transform though. Wormtail's finger never changed when he made the big escape, and there's no mention of partial transformations elsewhere.

***** True. Only the parts the wizard has control of count, so lost parts are considered dead, and thus locked in their state.

.... But it would be funny plot if every bit of an Animagus transformed, no matter where it was - imagine, ministry has the condolences and awards ceremony for Peter Pettigrew, his 'remains' of a silk pillow, and suddenly it transforms into a rat finger.

Then, either they get wise to his scheme, or they try to uncurse the finger... And if someone casts Homorphus while Wormtail is in some pipe, Voodoo!

** Well, animagery is transfiguration, which is not permanent... Then again, a person who dies while under polyjuice does not revert to their own body (or else the guards at Azkaban would have noticed they had Mrs. Crouch and not Barty Jr).

We don't know whether the Potterverse adheres to the logic that a person's spells collapse when they're dead. It's /hinted/ at, with the Fidelius falling upon the secret keeper's death, and in using the state of the Dark Mark to judge Voldie's continued existence and subsequent return. But those could be specific cases. The Sorting Hat didn't lose it's enchantment when the Founders passed.

** Oh, extra thing to think about with animagery: I know glasses and clothes and small amounts of inorganic material are absorbed in the transformation, but what if you had a metal arm or limb or any significant amount of cybernetics in your body? Would those transform into fleshy animal limbs or cybernetic animal limbs?

** My guess is that the eaten animagus will transform and burst the belly of the one that had eaten it.There is this spell that forces animagi to transform back, so I think that an animagus has to actively control the magic of the transformation to stay transformed as an animal.It is also not their 'true' form and their magic will try to transform them back into their original human shape if there is no control - like accidental magic. Or people could simply transform other people into ferrets and the victims will be never able to transform back - so I think that everyone's inborn magic will try to break the transformation and reshape the body into one's original form at some point, probably not in an instant, but it will happen. Like a metamorphmagus, they subconsciously know how their original form looks like.

There was a fanfic I once read where Harry didn't know about Rita's animagus form, but he saw a beetle sitting on Hermione's shoulder and flung it away with his finger. The beetle crashed against a wall and died - of course. Harry didnt pay attention to it, but Rita's body was found the very next day. It was told that she was brutally beaten to death and her body looked like mauled by a dragon or so.
