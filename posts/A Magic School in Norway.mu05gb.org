:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm trying to find this fic where the parents of the slytherin's in Harry's year send their kinds to the Netherlands and make a school there. Narcissa and Draco are definitely part of it. The school (and the series of fics named after it) has an L name?

Eventually Harry gets expelled, for the dementors i think. He and Sirius go 'on the run' to the school. Harry learns wandlore? And Sirius eventually magically adopts Draco.

Ringing any bells????
