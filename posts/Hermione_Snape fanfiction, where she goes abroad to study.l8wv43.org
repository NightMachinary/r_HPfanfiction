Hi, I have been going crazy searching for this fanfiction and there are only a few details I remember:

Hermione and Snape are together and I think that Dumbledore finds out and makes Hermione go study abroad (perhaps to the US?). They exchange only letters and don't see each other.

Then there is a scene where either Snape or Dumbledore come to that school and his appearance is highly anticipated by the headmaster of Hermione's school. She has a hard time persuading her headmaster to let her greet him when he comes, because he doubts Hermione knows him.

And Hermione works hard to get through her curriculum faster so that she is finished sooner with the school and can come back to England to Snape.

I hope that you understood my ramblings and that you recognised the fanfic! I will be very grateful for all your replies! Thank you.
