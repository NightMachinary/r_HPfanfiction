This is a fic I read a long time ago, and the part I am describing is a small part of it, but the scene that stands out in my head is that the Twins are fighting a battle that is taking place at a funeral.

In this fic they share each other's thoughts almost like a hive mind. It is the reason for their twinspeak and (in this fic) why they work so well in battle as a team.

In this battle one of the twins dies and the other experiences the vast empty solitude for the first time. I remember it being a very well-written and heart breaking scene.

Hope this is enough to go on.
