So I am planning out a fic that features a lot of magic. One of the things in it is arithmancy. I want to depict it less in the more common fanon "it lets you make spells" and more along the lines of "arithmancy allows you to approximate the affects of magic on the world, similar to divination."

But to do this, I need to incorporate more interesting aspects of numerology and ideas of magical numbers. I have some ideas, especially regarding the value of prime numbers in magic versus divisible numbers, but I am interested in anything that people can offer regarding numerology and numbers that would affect magic in the HP system. Any information would be helpful.


** Here's what I have so far in a Rumination file:

Perhaps Arithmancy isn't exactly about mathematics, so much as the meaning of numbers. Qabbalistic numerology ascribes certain qualities to each numeral. I've built up a headcanon about it somehow addressing how certain magic interacts with other magic.

Rather than be saddled with the arbitrary meaning of letters in names = factors, I figured that magical arithmancy was about typifying spells and substances to better understand how they interact.

It would have grown out of the intuitive understanding discovered in potion-making over the centuries, but might not have gotten a regimented treatment until the 1800's, when scientific method began to help weed out inconsequential aspects of magic ('while standing in a wooden pail filled with fishtails, during a waxing moon...') that the truly meaningful patterns began to emerge. Sorcerers always knew that hair made for the best source in Polyjuice, and that you can conjure water much more readily than milk, but arithmancy began to explain why.

My problem with much of the 'real-world' numerology is how arbitrary some of the qualities seem, even moreso when applied to the naming of children; would prospective Jewish parents approach the scholar about best names for encouraging certain traits, or was their attempt to 'game the system' likely to create a monster?

So I went back to the numbers themselves- ignore history, ignore pure mathematics. What do these numbers mean?

[extract from A Story of Magic - as yet unpublished]

So, when we speak of arithmantic meaning, we are speaking of the whole of human spiritual culture, distilled into nigh-on universal meanings. These meanings vary with culture and you can see bias in the spirits of east Asia in comparison to those, say, of the deep Amazon, but their meanings are our meanings, often derived from more... mathematical truths.

One. It is the smallest, the sole object. Alone yet complete. It's geometric representation is a dot.

"Not a sphere?"

A dot. Zoom in on the dot and you will discover it is still a dot, because One has no subcomponents.

Two. The essence of communication. From here to there. Two is represented by a circle- the center and orbit. It is also the symbol for pain and loss and fear, for only by cleaving one into two did everything start to hurt.

Three. It takes the simple binary of two and adds a dimension, multiplying meaning, creating both dissention and dynamism. It is therefore also the number for creativity... and lies

Four. the first multiple. Symbol is --

"A square."

No, it's a three-sided pyramid. Four is a family, sustainable procreation. It is also stability and truth, for only by having two opposing sides sharing equal voice is there something to match against. It is also the first possible solid object- more than a shadow.

Five. The hand, artifice, the incomplete array, the broken star- it also represents humanity in our lost-our-tails aspect and unrestrained power.

Six. Armies. Two triangles arrayed at cross purposes. Also, a strong model for division and unification. Six also represents society and culture.

Seven is the soul, and location. It establishes existence. The geometric representation of seven is a double pyramid. One point at the center, one length out, forward and back, to left and to right, up and down. All connected, they form the double pyramid, a reflection of life in death. Perfection, but also isolation.

Eight. the cube, structure, architecting - also the compass, to chart a vector; plans and destinations

Nine. squares of trios, or the spiral - the unfinished grouping - community - the compass with a center, to represent the ship

Eleven and Twenty-two were made up, as far as I'm concerned.

There's too much culture behind it and not enough prehistorical symbolism. It's like they miscalculated the factors on two and four, then tried to shoehorn in a second meaning to flatter someone or cover their error.

** Read the numerological part of the second book of the Three Books on Occult Philosophy by Cornelius Agrippa (it's 1$ on Kindle). And if you are able to get your hands on them then read also: Introduction to Arithmetic by Nicomachus of Geresa and Boethian Number Theory: A Translation of the De Institutione Arithmetica by Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius.

This will present the numerology in the Neoplatonic and Neopythagorean framework which fits thematically well with how magic is presented in Harry Potter.

*** Some other stuff that may be interesting if you want to go deep into the rabbit hole.

- Theology of Arithmetic by Pseudo-Iamblichus (sensible price)
- Mathematics Useful for Understanding Plato: Or, Pythagorean Arithmetic, Music, Astronomy, Spiritual Disciplines (somehow Latin edition of this is easily available, English, not so much)

** Well one thing I've been thinking about would be what I call the 'probabilistic approach to potion making', which is my take on how probability theory and statistics could be applied to magical effects.

The basis of it is that we assume magical effects to be random, meaning that we can use probability models to guess at what could happen. The most useful canon application of this would be trying to find the correct combination of clockwise/anticlockwise stirs in a potion (because, seriously, how exactly do they do that canonically?) Using stochastic processes.

The other main thing I've thought about is whether or not Arithmancy follows the muggle mathematical notion of logical deduction or if magic nullifies the importance of logic in mathematics. I think a system like that would suit HP pretty well.

** So I want to throw some ideas I have regarding arithmancy. As I see it, Divination and Arithmancy are predictions about magic and its effects on the world. Much like how prophecy can be true but is not always true or the way people think it will be, arithmancy can predict certain effects of magic, such as spells, but one cannot design something like a formula or math equation. Some examples I can think of are:

- Arithmancy could be used to predict what life a wizard will lead based on the number of letters in their names. However, since wizards have more than one name, people rarely fall into one archetype. Rather, one can glean a hint of information about them from their title (like with Snape in PoS). This has pervaded mythical history, especially with the concept of the "true name" giving power of others over you (dating all the way to the time of Socrates and Herpo the Foul).
- Prediction through arithmancy is both more clear and more complicated than divination. Arithmancy involves considering the multiple aspects that go into magic (ex. location, caster or source, other affecting magics), and is thus difficult to utilize in practically as well. Traditionally, the simpler the question, the better the prediction (similar to Occam's Razor).
- Arithmancy can be utilize in many ways, but it requires determining a system that can work. This is far more difficult than is worth, thus its relegation as a lesser discipline. One example I have is that some wandmakers (such as say Gregorovitch) have attempted to find a "formula" for wand creation: attempting to find patterns of wands for different wand woods, cores, lengths and rigidity. Others (like say the Ollivanders) rely more on instinctual understanding, of experience and history of their family, to determine the type of person a wand will likely be suited for. Both approaches can have drawbacks and advantages (Arithmancy vs. Divination).
- You cannot create spells with numbers. BUT you can learn information from a spell by certain things: the number of wand motions, the number of letters and syllables in a spell, etc. An understanding of arithmancy can thus help you determine how to create magic that you are interested in. This is why Snape had many crossing out's of his "Sectumsempra" curse: he had an effect he wished to create, so he was trying different combinations of factors till he found the correct one. HOWEVER, nothing is concrete, and no spell can be truly predicted and thus requires either extreme determination and/or a deeper connection to magic than average people.
- Prime numbers have far reaching magical capability, and have metriculated through wizarding culture (or at least Europe and by proxy the Americas). Some view that the best spells are ones that invoke prime numbers, such as /protego, accio, depulso,/ and s/tupefy/ (which affects why they are some of the most useful spells). Conversely, it might be that certain numbers of letters or syllables in a spell are more effective on certain types of spells (ex. Transfiguration invokes combinations of four (/evanesco/), as greek philosophers speculated all matter could be separated into four elemental components).

Love to hear some thoughts that anyone has on these. I want to try and capture magic as canon-like as possible.

*** At first I though divining future /from/ a name was a terrible idea. Since names and titles are /given/ by another. It would be like reading tea-leaves but ones that had been placed in a prearranged pattern.

But then I had a thought.

Obviously, people would attempt to game the system, giving children names to direct their future in a specific way, or enemies harmful titles. And obviously this would, 9/10 times, go horribly wrong.

The child given the name meaning 'finder of lost things' finds a lost place, but get's lost there. One given a name 'destine to take part in a great battle' is the first casualty as a wall collapses on them at the start of the battle. The enemy given a title meaning 'weakness' becomes adept at finding them in others.

Now that I can imagine fitting in as part of the lore.

It would also fit well with [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/naming-seers][Naming Seers]], who could predict the most suitable name for a child.

One thing you haven't mentioned is symbolism.

If you haven't already, have a look at [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/polyjuice-potion][this page about Polyjuice Potion]]. There's some very interesting talk from Rowling about the meaning and symbolism behind ingredients. Things like Lacewing Flies are used for tying and binding two things, because that's what laces do.

And [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Study_of_Ancient_Runes][this page on runes]]. Again, symbolism is very important. A Fwoopers four colours represent the number four, 'Unknown' represents seven, because 7 is a powerful magical number shrouded in mystery.

(Oh! While looking that up, I found [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Seven][this page about the number 7]] featuring various relations to 7, including names.)

Overall, while numbers play a very important part in magic, the symbolism and associative meaning of things can't be forgotten.
