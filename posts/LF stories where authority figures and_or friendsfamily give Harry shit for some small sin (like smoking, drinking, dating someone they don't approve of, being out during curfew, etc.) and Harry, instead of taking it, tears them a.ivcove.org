So, as you can see, I'm in the mood for some entertaining drama, but not if Harry is taking without firing (i.e no useless angst pls.)

Two recc's that have elements of the above:

linkffn(Lies by Molly Morisson)

My holy grail of Harry/Order drama. It does get a bit too angsty at places and sometimes it becomes so melodramatic it veers to the absurd. Very entertaining drama though.

linkao3(Blood Magic by Gateway Girl)

A severitus story, a lot better that the usual trashy fare. Masterful characterization and dialogue, plenty of instances where Harry is a little shit doing things he shouldn't.


** There's some of this with harry to McGonagall and molly in linkffn(something wicked this way comes by the mad mad reviewer)

  Blood magic was supposed to keep Harry safe, but his relatives are expendable. Blood magic was supposed to keep Harry looking like his adoptive father, but it's wearing off. Blood is a bond, but so is the memory of hate -- or love.

*** Ok I read a bit of that and I have to say... what the fuck?

In the first couple of chapters it's revealed that McGonagall is Harry's great aunt, through his mother's side. So he didn't really need to stay with the Dursleys? And he's instantly OK with that?

That aside, the story is barely coherent. Everyone is wildly OOC, even for a post-OttP story.

Do me a favor and spoil the first story fully for me if you have the inclination. I'm curious as to wtf is going on, but not curious enough to read 300k of that mess.

**** It grows on you. After reading canon rehashes for years, I have started enjoying OOC fics, and feel the way the author has kept the characters (mostly) but changed the storyline to be quite inventive. If that's not your cup of tea, it's OK, but you DID ask for fics where Harry 'tears them a new one' and this one has it.
