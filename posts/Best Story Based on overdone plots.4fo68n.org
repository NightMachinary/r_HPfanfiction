3 - linkffn(The Denarian Renegade by Shezza)

6 - linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi)

7 - linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man) This one's love or hate

8 - linkffn(The Bonds of Blood by Darth Marrs) Really angsty, but used to be really popular back in the day

11 - I've seen one of these before where Harry was kidnapped when young that was decent. He was paired with Ginny here. Can't find it though.

*** I was going to recommend /Prince of Slytherin/ because of how it takes so many cliches and sort of plays with them.

I'll just have to recommend linkffn(The Merging by Shaydrall) instead because of how it takes cliches and charges right into them but is still a fun and interesting read.

****** British culture, people generally don't call each other with first names unless /very/ close (think about the Sherlock Holmes stories and how he and Watson call each other by their last names even though they are pretty much life partners), and for most people in Britain the fact that someone is as uncomfortable with their name as Tonks is is enough of a reason never to switch.

It might be justified in the story, which I wouldn't know about because I have yet to read it, but so far I am tentatively with [[/u/Hpfm2][u/Hpfm2]] on this issue as without knowing about any in-story reasons for it it feels ... well, out of place, really.

******* Having been born and raised in the East of England for the last 23 years I would like to think I know what British culture is like (and if you want proof there are some posts way back in my history about traffic in Peterborough).

The only people who call each other by last names are the old public school set who are in their 40s or 50s and very close old people. I call my family, my friends, my co-workers, my boss and people I meet by their first names and have never met anyone who would act otherwise.

I would even go so far as to say that calling people by their last name is a fairly rude thing to do unless you have been friends for a long time.

Edit: Sherlock Holmes is set in the 1890s. HP is set in the 1990s. Etiquette on addressing people has changed in 100 years.

******** The thing is, as far as culture goes, the wizards are a bit behind the times so 1890s are likely to be a better representation than 1990s are.

Don't get me wrong, I am not saying that you don't know what you are talking about. It's just that the time that most likely corresponds culturally to the wizarding world as built by Madame Rowling is not the current time, and thus it's not the current etiquette that matters either.

I definitely should have made that clearer when I wrote my previous reply. I could defend myself but saying that I'm not feeling all that good right now, but that's excuses since thinking doesn't hurt now and the truth is that it seemed too obvious for me that people would remember about this bit of difference when Holmes is mentioned.

I should note that in this fic Harry (who was raised as a 1980s muggle boy) does call Tonks 'Tonks' to start with but as he gets to know her and they get friendlier he complains that it doesn't feel right calling her by her last name hence the 'Nym' bit.

I could see the Slytherins or co-workers in the Ministry using last names for everyone though. (It would even make sense with the bigotry favouring old families and old names.)

It still does feel a bit weird for me since I don't think Tonks would feel happy with it happening and it takes two sides rather than only Harry, but I do understand where you are coming from and /maybe/ it will make sense to me too if I ever decide to try to read that particular story.

Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

It does take a few chapters to establish his plots, but he does an excellent job making sure everyone has a motivation for the things they do, even the abuse from Vernon and the nigh-hysterical hatred of Harry by James Potter. This fic meets 5, 6 and 7.
