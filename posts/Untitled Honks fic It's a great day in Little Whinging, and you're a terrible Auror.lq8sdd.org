Like it says on the tin really. a Honks (Harry/Tonks) prompt for a humorous one shot inspired by an untitled game where you terrorize a normal neighborhood in numerous little ways. Ideally One part mischievous pranks, one part klutz shenanigans, and a generous dash of love and affection between a boy and his metamorphic girlfriend

** Can Metamorphmagi literally transform themselves into animals? Like, for example, some kind of horrible bird?

*** No, they cannot but

And consider it my contribution to the Horror genre

Tonks was talented enough that she could effortlessly transform parts of her features into their animal equivalents

So theoretically you could be going on your afternoon stroll one day

And see that woman figure standing near the bush

And of course you notice because her hair are blue/pink/rainbow and it looks so unusual and wicked

But then /she turns around/

/Her face is that horrible beaked monstrosity/

/with beady bird eyes looking into your soul/

/Scary lady with a Goose face comes your way./

/You see her toothed tongue peaking between open maw-/

/She's getting closer./

/She/ HONKS
