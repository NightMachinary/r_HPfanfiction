Are there any good fics out there where Harry calls a bluff on the tournament, saying that it can't be magically binding when he didn't enter himself?

I'd be interested in fics where either the bluff just gets called and he doesn't participate, and everything else proceeds as it would have otherwise, or where there is some kind of negative magical effect. But if the second, then I'd like to see him continue to refuse to participate, even if it means he loses his magic or dies. Like, he's drawing a line in the sand because he /knows/ that he was entered for nefarious purposes, and he's not going along with it.

Thanks for any recs :)


** Okay, so I know a few where Harry still participates, but does so in a way that makes the tournament organizers look like idiots. One is "Honestly, Harry" on Ffn.

  Harry Potter never wanted to compete in the tournament in the first place. And when his name mysteriously came out of the goblet, he still didn't. So he did what any sensible wizard would do, and didn't care. [Harry x Hermione - best friends to romantic]

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

** You don't mention pairing preferences, but I read this fic recently and it's pretty much exactly that plot. Harry runs from the tournament and loses his magic, and spends the next ten years hiding the muggle world without staying in any one country too long.

*** Wow, that plot sounds like exactly what I was looking for...I was going to say that I don't really have a pairing preference as long as it's done well, but then I saw this is Harry/Tom, and that is definitely one pairing I've ready very little of. It just usually either squicks me out or seems totally OOC. Or it's crack, which is OK, but a different kind of thing that's more for fun. But I gave this a chance. I liked the beginning, but I super do not understand the pairing. Like...for this to be at all realistic to me, I would need to see Tom feel intense, painful remorse for murdering Harry's parents. For that to be addressed. Or for it to be an AU where he didn't actually kill his parents. I just do not get how people just take it as given that this could happen between a person who murdered another person's parents, except as something sick and twisted.

Nothing personal if you're into it, and I still appreciate the rec.

**** I too enjoyed this one... until ending. (it's a 2chapter story, so it was short)

I too don't feel like Voldemort/Harry works, but this story somewhat works... as I can see it as: Harry's magic ended up in Voldemort, and changed his values --> Harry automatically feels his lack of magic in the background --> when Tom who is still obsessed (along with Harry's magic wanting to return pulling him constantly through the Horcrux-link) shows up, Harry reacts more to his magic than to Tom the person... and then the fic ends... and I imagine Harry ends up being in a fugue state most of the time, drugged by his own magic
