Can anyone suggest to me some good fics where there are muggle main characters or some group of muggles find out about magic and interact with the magical world?

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

** I have a couple of self-recommendations.

Here's a vast, incomplete time-travel fixit: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15430560/chapters/35816418]])

And a dark, depressingly canon-compliant fic set in December of 1981: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14842689/chapters/34356255]])

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

  Complete! The Christmas of 1981 wasn't so merry for everyone. Who is this guy running from his past, trying to make it in the muggle world? What does he mean by the word “muggle,” anyway?Warning: this contains some disturbing stuff. The familiar characters and events in this are the property of J.K. Rowling of course.

It's complete and has a really interesting OC and Canon divergence as a result.

  It seemed like a routine assignment for CI5 officers Ron Weasley and Harry Potter: Investigate a physicist who had caught the attention of some unsavoury elements. Little did they know that Dr Hermione Granger would turn out to have more secrets than Ron would have thought possible.
