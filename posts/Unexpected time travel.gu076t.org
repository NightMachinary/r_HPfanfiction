** Not sure if this fits your Snape requirement because he becomes a reluctant ally, but not buddy-buddy. It's also not an unexpected time travel, but it is fantastically written and well plotted, so I'm going to recommend in the hope that you give it a try. It's the first in a series.

*** It's ok, like I said I don't believe it's possible to find a fics with all my conditions üòÖ, so they were more guide lines - I will give it a try üëçüèª

At the end if its well written it's good - I read so many badly written fanfics I really tired of them.
