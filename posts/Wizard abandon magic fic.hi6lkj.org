** I'm slowly working on a series called Employee of the Month, in which Remus can't deal with the magical world between the wars so he lives in the muggle world instead. I don't know if that really fits your request since it's more about being rejected by the prejudice in magical society than rejecting magic by choice.

  Complete! The Christmas of 1981 wasn't so merry for everyone. Who is this guy running from his past, trying to make it in the muggle world? What does he mean by the word “muggle,” anyway?Warning: this contains some disturbing stuff. The familiar characters and events in this are the property of J.K. Rowling of course.

** Not quite it, but there's a character in linkffn(The Peace Not Promised) who intends to pursue a career in the muggle world, and keep their magic covert. Another finds work at a pub run by the muggle father of a witch, who is aware of magic and pleased by how easily they can clear tables and clean glassware, with the customers typically not in a state to notice if they're careful.

(Also happens to be my favorite Snily time travel story, slower paced and a bit less angsty than Come Once Again and Love Me, although that one has excellent prose quality.)

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.

** My favorite story of this type is linkffn(To Become A Muggle by lifebitten). Harry decides magic isn't worth it.

Another story that sounds as though it fits is linkffn(Going Muggle by Xavras). I didn't care for as much of it as I read, and don't really remember it, but, as always, YMMV.

  Set after the Battle of Hogwarts. Harry and a few other classmates, individually decide to leave for the muggle world for various reasons. EWE. No slash. (There will be more than angst and romance, there will be: Revenge, Fighting, Good men, Bad men, Beautiful ladies, Passion, Chases, Escapes, - wait, it's not that story, but it still should be fun)
