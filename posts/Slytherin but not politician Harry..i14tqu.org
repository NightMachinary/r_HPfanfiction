This is somewhat related to a post that talks about how being a Slytherin would lead Harry to greatness. So what I'm looking for is a fic where Harry goes into Slytherin without having prior knowledge of Slytherin politics and it's either sink or swim. A Harry that has to work hard to get recognition and to rise above the others. Not Prince of Slytherin because I'm already reading that. Preferably 100k+ and no slashes tho pairings are welcome.


** If you don't mind fem!Harry, one of the best "non-political Slytherin protag" I've found is Victoria Potter: linkao3(13795605)

Victoria learns a bit about Wizarding politics and blood-status from her Housemates, but the author goes out of his way to avoid the "11 year old politicians" tropes.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First year complete as of Chapter 12.
