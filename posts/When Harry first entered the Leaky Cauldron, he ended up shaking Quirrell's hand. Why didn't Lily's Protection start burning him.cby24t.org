** Voldemort wasnt possessing him yet. He was just working for voldy. After he failed to steal the philosophers stone from gringotts Voldemort wanted more direct supervision. So he started possessing him shortly after the diagon alley trip

**** Might as well get used to it. It also serves as a good evidence to support his claim that he was gifted the turban as an important gift

"His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie"

******** You're talking about a different culture. The Wizarding World isn't like our Muggle one. Covering one's face is the norm in the Hog's Head. Can you name a pub where it's almost expected that you wear a mask or a hood? I don't think anybody would think twice about his fashion choices, as long as they weren't Muggle clothing, tbh.

In the sixth book, people were buying fake protective spells and charmed objects in hopes for protection from dark magic, so it's not /unreasonable/ to think that within the fabrics are a spell or a charm or something to battle the Dark Arts. Quirrell is a genius. We know this because he was one of the very few to find Voldemort, others should know this from talking to him. If Quirrell says his turban is for protection, it's probably very believable to those around him. The man studies /all the time/ there's no way he'd buy into something so fake, right?

Meta: It's from a prince. It's fairly special. Some of us buy used gum from celebrities or used bath water. Considering this.....the turban is not weird at all. Also, it might just be a difference in culture.

#+begin_quote
  I can't imagine anyone thinking, oh let me give this bloke some cloth as a thank you to get rid of a zombie
#+end_quote

Maybe it was not his only gift. Maybe it was culturally important. Maybe the Zombie was troublesome, but not dangerous enough to gift something more.

#+begin_quote
  and from what we know about possession and the magical world,
#+end_quote

We know pretty much nothing really. The only times the head isn't needed, is when it's a horcrux. For example, The Diary to Ginny(although we can't be sure the head didn't just appear on moments she was possesed), and Harry in book 5. He was a horcrux to Voldemort. Although, again, we don't know if he didn't grow a head. Dumbledore was looking at his face.

  or why there was no other way over covering it up

For example?

******* Let me put it this way: As someone whose culture/religion involves men choosing to wear turbans, the context of this exchange makes very little sense to me. I understand that there's a million ways to justify it in the context of the wizarding world, but to me, reading back, Quirrel obsessively wearing a turban from an African prince just feels flimsy.

Looks like someone needs to re-read the books... Voldemort could do that after his resurrection because he used Harry's blood. This was the specific reason he insisted on using Harry and refusing Wormtail's suggestions to just use someone else. It was all to neutralise Lily's protective magic, which otherwise would have continued to make Harry an anti-Voldemort.

** So folks are saying Voldemort wasn't possessing him yet. However, I question if that's the right way to put it. While I agree that the line from Quirrell...

#+begin_quote
  "When I failed.... He punished me... decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me,"
#+end_quote

...might lead one to believe he was yet to be possessed, other elements bring this into question. His stutter, his demeanor, his turban, and the timing of when he would have come across Voldemorts wraith and when school starts.

Just a note... that Interestingly, in the movie, I believe he is shown to actively avoid shaking Harry's hand in the Leaky Cauldron.

In my headcanon I have always assumed that the "dark" taint on Quirrell was still fairly minor at that point, with Voldemort having limited consistent control. In a sense, Voldemort was "connected" or "tied" to Quirrell via something similar to a Horcrux (like Harry's scar). In addition, Quirrelmort had yet to start drinking Unicorn blood and having a "cursed" life, which could have lead to more severe reactions from blood protection.

** Just a guess, and I haven't read the books in a very long time so it could be a bad one, but maybe it's because of intent.

Like wasn't Lily's protection supposed to be intent based. If so, wouldn't it make sense if it didn't work when the target didn't intend to harm Harry?

Like in the leaky cauldron, quirrelmort didn't want to harm Harry yet, he just wanted to see him out of curiosity, but in the mirror room he wanted to kill Harry. Therefore the blood protection only activated in the mirror room.

Maybe, I don't know.
