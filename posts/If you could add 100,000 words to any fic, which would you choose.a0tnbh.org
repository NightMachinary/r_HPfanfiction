Alright bit of an oddball question but just imagine that you could pick any fic in existence, and immediately the author updates it with 100k words. The writing style/pacing would be indistinguishable from the rest of the fic (at the same level) and would extend the plot out the way the author intended.

What story do you go for? Do you pick a story that's currently being updated but you can't wait to read what the author has planned, or do you go for an abandoned story that you'd love to see fleshed out a bit more. A story that's super fast paced to squeeze the 100k words for all they're worth, or a slow paced story like Prince of Slytherin that might not see much plot progress?

** I was rather impressed by linkffn(Forging the Sword), which appears to be abandoned. 100k words could do a lot there.

Nightmares of Futures Past would definitely be my top contender, except that the author continues to give assurances that it's still in progress, just hindered by his ongoing recovery. So I'd save my wish for a different one.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20) is not bad either, and updates only very slowly, although the more recent chapters haven't felt like the high point of the story.

Actually, are we limited to Harry Potter? I'd be rather interested to see that much added to linkffn(Saruman of Many Devices)

** Linkffn(The Sum of Their Parts)

There is an entire fic missing between the second last chapter and the epilogue. I wanted to see more of Dark!Ron and Dark!Hermione helping the new Dark Lord Potter ascend into power. There were also other scenes in the epilogue that could also been fleshed out upon like Dark!Neville's speech in the Wizengamot and how he still manages to stay free after proclaiming his support for a new Dark Lord or Dark!Susan taking over the DMLE and imposing her will. I go back there once in a while just in the faint hope the author updates. There is so much set-up in that fic and then it adruptly ends just before it gets to the interesting parts

** *What you leave behind -* /By Newcomb/

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/1/What-You-Leave-Behind]]

​

A fanfic which immediately caught my attention and made its way into my top 20 favourites. It has great characterisation (especially Cedric!), riveting plot, and its amazingly written. Unfortunately it has not been updated in over 3 years. *However*, I have periodically private messaged the author (who has also done other very enjoyable fics) asking for any update on the story, to which I received a reply saying that the story will eventually be continued (which allowed me a sigh of relief).

​

The main points of divergences to cannon as mentioned by 'Romulus Agustulus' on DLP is that.

1. Arianna did not die in the fight between Albus, Grindlewald, and Aberforth.
2. Harry is born a year earlier.

It is still a work in progress so I still have high hopes to see this story completed!

​

Also check out the other Fic the same author has written. its called *The Lesser Sadness*. Another story which is fantastically written and I eagerly await to see updated!

** linkffn(Six Pomegranate Seeds) by Seselt.

I love the prose in this, it draws me in. Seselt's style of writing is phenomenal, in my opinion. Add in to that a plot that I love, which is basically summed up as "Time-Travel Hermione becomes a Pureblood and goes to Slytherin and tries very hard not to mess up the timeline while trying to save the world." Both Hermione and the original characters (both fanon OC and actual OC) are really well written too.

Sadly, the fic was marked as complete with the most recent update, and yet it doesn't wrap up a bunch of questions most people had. It really didn't feel like an ending to me.

Even if it is complete, and not just marked that way while the author works on an epilogue, I don't even mind that I'll never get the ending I want. Because the fic is just. That. Good. At least, it is to me. So I would love another 100,000 words, because I want it to go on that much longer, and also I'd love to see an ending, or at least a sequel!

** Dragon Pox by Melverne linkffn(5436066)

It's an amazing kidfic from the era before Mrs. Figg was canon-ly made a Squib, and features an amazing cast of characters like Mrs. Longbottom, Amelia Bones, and Mrs. Abbot, along with their assorted children. Basically: "The Old Dame Society Sets Things Right". It's a little heavy on the abuse the Dursleys do to Harry, which isn't my favorite thing to read about, but other than that it's a charming story that stopped updating much too soon.

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.

I read through it recently, actually. I think it could use a better summary, because it sounds like it would be impossibly saccharin or angsty, but it's actually quite solid. Just knowing up front that Harry was widowed would have put the summary in a much more favorable light for me.
