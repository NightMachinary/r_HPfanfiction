I can't remember the title but I know that Regulus was a main character. When Harry went back in time he got captured and locked up, Regulus was captured while he was shopping (I think in Knockturn Alley but I'm not 100% sure). They were kept in the same room together, in complete darkness, and there was some sort of magic dust everywhere that was making them delusional. Harry produced a wandless patronus and sent it to Sirius, Sirius came and helped them escape and took them back to James' house on his motorbike. I read it on ao3 but it could possibly be on another website. Sorry if this is a bit vague.
