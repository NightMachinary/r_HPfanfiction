This is a what if you are in the world of Harry Potter. The greek witch Circe from the Odyssey is trying to take over the world. The golden trio tries to apprehend her at first but she turns Hermione into half cat half huam hybrid. The only person that is able to stop it is you, a muggle who work with the wizarding community as mercenary and your SO. You use grit, guns and a melee weapon of your choice. You write how you would interact with the trio and if you have kids or not. Also, you are like Indiana Jones, wherein you are not overpower and you do have flaws.

Anyways happy writing and send me in the comments your fics.
