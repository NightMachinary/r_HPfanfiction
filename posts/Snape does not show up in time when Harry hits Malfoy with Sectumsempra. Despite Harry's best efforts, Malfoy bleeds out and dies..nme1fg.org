** Harry gets celebrated for killing a marked Death Eater as soon as someone notices the tattoo. The Ministry in particular was doing badly at the time & would have gloried in the positive press of 'the Chosen One' protecting Hogwarts from a terrorist-- especially since the Malfoy name was mud at the time, with Lucius recently having been sent to Azkaban.

At the same time, Harry could have some real character growth in a number of ways.

*** I'm not sure the absurdly graphic, gorey, and painful death Malfoy would experience would be seen as a good thing. I actually think the press would be better if it was an AK. But sectumsempra is a graphically dark curse

**** except that from what we know in canon use of the killing curse on another person gets you sent to Azkaban. Now that I think about it that would be an even better solution to the "how to sent harry to azkaban?" question in those type of stories.

** Why does nobody use this as a valid reason for all those "Harry goes to Azkaban" stories? This would actually be something logical. I actually hate that in canon Harry got away with it as scott free as he did.

*** While I agree some people might see it as reason for those kind of stories. on the other hand you have "Boy-who-lived is attacked, kills marked Death Eater" as how most people would see it. Given that Scrimgeour is Minister, and Dumbledore I honestly dont see reason for Harry suffering any real consequence. Besides canon!Harry's own pity party.

*** Well, there's a number of reasons:

1) All Harry knew was that the spell was ‘for enemies'. He didn't know what the spell did, and (considering he had a rather good opinion of the ‘Half - Blood Prince') has no reason to suspect it would be that bad.

2) Draco was /in the middle of casting the cruciatus curse./ This had /absolutely no provocation./ Harry had not just killed his mother, he had not delivered some unspeakable insult, all he had done was stumble upon him venting to Moaning Myrtle.

Frankly, given what we see of Frank and Alice Longbottom, Draco dying would probably be what he deserved for unleashing the Cruciatus for absolutely no reason.
