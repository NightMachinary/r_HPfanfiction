I'm reading one right now that has knockturn alleyish politics and harry is in the darker alleys.

I was wondering if anyone has any other fics with the different alleys in it and are more centerd on them.

If any of you are intrested the one I'm reading is, on Fanfiction.net, called *The Pureblood Pretense* by *murkybluematter.* The alleys are not a main point but come in in the second one.

** Blood Crest! (On both AO3 and FFN). Easily my favourite ongoing fic.
