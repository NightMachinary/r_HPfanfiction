*** If this happened either during fourth year (between Harry getting out of Hospital Wing and the year ending) or the absolute beginning of fifth, that'd /instantly/ deflate the Ministry's ability to discredit him - and possibly double their /efforts/ to.

"There is nothing 'out there', mister Potter."

"Tell that to Pansy Parkinson, who's currently in Azkaban for firing a /Killing Curse/ at me. Tell it to Theo Nott, who only got away because his reflexes were slower and he couldn't get the spell out in time - and who still got expelled for blatantly trying to arrange an 'accident' in Potions class.\\
I don't know about anyone else, but I think the whole school can attest to the fact that people /are/, in fact, out to get me - and by extent, anyone who'd even consider sticking up for me."

Bonus points, since he didn't need to mention Voldemort, she can't then launch into "he's not back!" tirades.

** Harry groaned as his eyes blinked open. Where was he? What was going on? He felt something hard under his cheek, and saw dark wood through squinting eyes. He was in the Great Hall. That's right, he had died. He remembered now, it had happened so quickly: a flash of green light from somewhere off to his side, and then he was dead. But he also remembered something else... there had been another person, another being, who had spoken to him... after he had died? Yes, he could remember something else. The misty white of King's Cross, a figure he couldn't remember the features of speaking to him, and then...

He had been given a choice. He remembered that. He could get on the train, and journey onward. But he also remembered looking down, at that pitiful creature. An infant. Voldemort. What would happen if he left? Would Voldemort be able to return to life in his body? He could never allow that, so he had turned his back on the train, and begun walking. He had walked on for what seemed like forever, his eyes growing heavy, drooping, blinking closed, until finally they closed, and didn't open again.

Still he had walked, blind to his surroundings. Complete blackness had replaced the complete whiteness of wherever he was, so nothing much changed. He had kept walking. Left, right. Left, right, left, he could no longer feel his feet, but he was sure he was still walking. And then he could feel nothing. He simply was. He floated in the black void, although he was sure he was still waking through the white. And then his eyes had opened.

Feeling was returning to his body. He could wiggle his fingers and toes, and now he had a headache. A myriad of voices surrounded him. Loud, too loud.

“Quiet,” He whispered, pushing himself up from the table. “Quiet,” He repeated, this time louder, “Please. All this talking is making my head hurt,”

And surprisingly there was silence.

“H-Harry?” He heard Hermione's voice whisper from nearby. He turned to look but everything was blurry and he couldn't make out any differences between the wall of people around him.

“Harry,” Professor McGonagall spoke up, “How are you still alive?” And that was all everyone needed to begin talking all at once, all with a similar question.

Dumbledore spoke up and somehow everyone heard and quieted again. He said something, but Harry couldn't really make out what was going on anymore, and then he passed out.

---

Madam Pomfrey soon cleared him from the hospital wing.

“There's not a thing wrong with him,” She had said, “In fact he seems to be slightly better off than he was before he...”

His magic still worked, which he was glad for. He hadn't felt any different, and none of the many healers who came to Hogwarts to see him found anything, although they all agreed that he /had/ died, it simply hadn't stuck. But Harry was different now. He couldn't deny that. He looked around the Great Hall now, and there was a hare sitting over at Ravenclaw's table. Just, sitting there. Doing nothing. And a vulture sitting near him at the Gryffindor table, tearing into a rotting carcass. Always, all day, everyday. It made him sick, and he could hardly eat. He had seen a thestral out the window, once, only instead of the horse sized black thing, it had been blood red, and three times too big. He saw all these things, and he saw that no one else saw them. So he kept quiet. And if Harry Potter walked strangely, as if avoiding something that wasn't there, and if he flinched away from things no one else could see, and if he had started talking to that Lovegood girl more, no one noticed. And no one cared.

***** Hmm...

Or something more abstract, like Lovecraftian aspects.

These entities aren't really what they appear to be, obviously -- perhaps they're representations of some incomprehensible abominations/deities beyond our understanding.

Having taken one step to the right of existence, thanks to being hit with the Killing Curse, he can perceive them.

They take no notice of him, since he's so far below their notice that they almost cannot comprehend him, like a candle burning in the middle of a house-fire.

But, the longer he sees them, they begin to take notice of the newcomer in their midst, like that candle changing colour to something more distinct and being alone in the dark for miles around. And they're /very/ curious about him and his perspective.

Reality begins to shift subtly as they become more active. People notice but don't notice.

Some people begin to act differently as these entities seize control of their bodies and minds temporarily to experience mortality through them, like drones.

And when they leave, echoes remain: some are harmless, like Pansy Parkinson developing an odd fascination with art, to worrisome, like phobias and self-destructive tendencies/breakdowns, to the horrific, such as self-mutilations, suicides...

Hmm... two possible ideas:

The one who tried to kill Harry, e.g. Daphne Greengrass or a lesser-used Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff, is briefly taken over as the entity wants to understand why she did what she did, since she was the one to bring this newcomer to their attention.

As a result, she becomes obsessed over him compared to the non-murderous way she did before, starting a cult.

The other is that she suddenly finds herself warped and twisted by this brief possession, becoming fascinated and obsessed with a boy she had, hours prior, disliked at best.

Or Harry just finds himself struggling to maintain his sanity, with Luna, as ants among a land of unfathomable, eldritch beings, beneath their notice.

If a bunch of ants started dancing around on your kitchen tiles, carved weird symbols into them, then lit a fire and started chanting your name, you could be damn sure that you'd go over to at least find out what the fuck was going on and how the ants learned your name. :D

** The first thing Harry noticed was that his mother was weeping into his father's shoulder.

"Mum... Don't cry. Please don't cry." He tried to reach forward but there was a bundle weighing his arms down.

"We didn't want to see you again so soon, Harry." Silent tears rolled down James Potter's face. "You're too young to die. You have barely lived."

"Tell that to Draco Malfoy," Harry snorted. He always knew the little ferret would get him one day. And it turns out calling the arrogant toerag out as a Death Eater in the making had been a very bad idea indeed. Ah well. At the very least the subsequent scrutiny at Hogwarts might get rid of Umbridge if her Inquisitorial Squad was throwing Unforgivable Curses out like they were cheering charms. "Don't cry for me, Mum. I feel like I've got a lot done; I don't regret anything but dying before Voldemort." He said ruefully.

"Oh Harry..." His mother faced him, her irises looking an unearthly green in her bloodshot eyes. "You've been so selfless! You haven't had half the life you deserve! You should have had a good life!"

"I've done okay!" He protested, mildly offended.

"What your Mum is trying to say," James pointed out kindly, "is that we didn't want this for you. Fighting every day of your life, dying young - no parent wants that. No one is doubting your achievements, Harry, but you deserved to be happy. Everyone does."

"Even Voldemort?"

"On some level, yes. Had he been happy, he might not have sought power."

Harry snorted:

"Okay, I get it now. I see why Mum fell for you. You really did mature."

Lily laughed through her tears and James went red.

Harry took a step towards his parents, towards the great beyond, and found he could not move. It was as though a barrier lay between him and his family.

"What's going on?"

Lily smiled sadly and took a step towards her son.

"I think, perhaps, you might have time for a good life yet."

"Mum?"

"I don't think you're dead Harry, I think you're here to escort him." She pointed at the bundle in his arms.

Harry peeled the cloth back and nearly let go in shock. A baby with bloody raw skin wrinkled his non-existent nose and whimpered - it's cat-like red eyes shining bright with tears. It looked like a grotesque parody of childhood wearing Voldenort's face.

"What the hell is that?!" He whispered in shock.

"A stunted shard of a soul. Something we should pity," James said as he stared at the baby.

"A horcrux?" Questioned Lily. "I read about them when we went into hiding." She turned to Harry. "Never be pregnant and in hiding, Harry. It's boring as hell."

"I'll bear that in mind." Harry grinned. "What's a horcrux, anyway?"

"Nasty." James replied shortly. "Imagine you desperately didn't want to die so much, that you would rather split your soul..."

"You can /do/ that?" Harry was horrified.

"Oh yes. You do a ritual which culminates in the murder of an innocent, a ritual so vile that even the Blacks have rejected it." He looked like he was going to be sick as he continued slowly. "You put the broken piece of your soul in object. If you die, it will tether you to mortality."

Harry's heart sank.

"Let me guess? You become a shade of yourself - neither alive, nor dead."

"Until you manage to regain a body." James nodded.

"So this is..."

"A piece of Voldemort's soul."

"But why do I have it? I'm the one who got a face full of killing curse, not him."

"Harry." Lily had turned a shade of green. "Who is more innocent than a baby?"

"Oh God, I'm going to be sick..." Harry swayed a little. "You mean I was..."

"On the bright side," James cut across. "It looks like this Malfoy did you a favour. The curse hit... /It/ and not you."

Lily and Harry stared at him in disbelief.

"You are such an ass," his wife shook her head at him.

"Way to read the room, Dad."

They all smiled a moment before the child made a squalling noise.

"Give it to us, Harry." Lily held her arms out and stepped in front of Harry.

"What will happen to him?"

"We'll take it Beyond. It's time." James supplied.

"I can't follow you, can I?" Asked Harry, sadly, as he slowly placed th bundle in his mother's arms.

"No, thank God." James frowned. He gripped Harry's shoulder. "Go and live that good life, Harry. I don't want to see you here for at least a hundred years, okay?"

On an impulse, Harry hugged both of his parents - ignoring the fussing horcrux that was caught in the middle. He didn't care. Harry said the words he had wanted to for his entire life:

"I love you."

Xxxxxxxxxxxx

Harry Potter awoke with a gasp on the floor of the Great Hall. The entire student body of Hogwarts seemed to be gathered around him. The majority of the DA seemed to be in varying degrees of tears.

Somebody screamed as he sat up. It might have been Hermione, because she looked like she was going to have a heart attack. Or perhaps it was Madam Pomfrey, as she was knelt next to him and looked like she /had/ had that heart attack.

"Mr Potter! You were dead!"

"Um, I'm sorry..?" Harry felt his arm go dead as someone punched it. "Ow!"

"You utter git" Ron threw his arms around Harry. Hermione followed and the three of them stayed like that for a while.

That was the photo that Colin Creevey took. It was the one that made the front page of The Daily Prophet the next day, under the headline of /"The Boy Who Lived (Again)!"/

** "You really should tell someone about that"

Harry scowled, entirely unimpressed with his friend. They were having dinner in the Great Hall and Harry was already dreading the upcoming detention with Umbridge. Starting another discussion with Ron and Hermione really wasn't something he needed on his plate right now.

"Leave it be, Hermione", Harry said. "I already told you I'm not going to do that. Running to a teacher to complain about detention is not going to help me - especially not with the ministry breathing down my neck"

Harry felt like he'd already said the very same words a dozen of times, but that didn't stop Hermione from frowning and Ron from angrily shoving his fork away.

"Look, I gotta go. No need to give Umbridge more reason to give me detentions after all."

A number of things happened then, all in the blur of a moment. Harry got up. There was a sudden movement at the edge of his vision, accompanied by startled shouts. He whipped his head around, and had no time to do anything but instinctively raise his hands in futile defense as a sudden green flash hit him.

And then he was in King's Cross. Naked.

Not that there was much familiarity in this weird, pristine version of King's Cross. Everything felt slightly off; not necessarily in a bad way. Just different.

This sentiment was also applied to the only other living (living?) being in this train station.

"Sirius?!"

"Lord, no."

And he was right, he wasn't. Despite how alike this man looked to Sirius, it was not him.

"I see, you had the misfortune to meet my beloved brother." The guy smirked.

Harry's epiphany was sudden. Sirius had only had one brother, the Death Eater one. And that one was- "I'm dead?"

"Yes, but also no."

The silence between the two was charged with tension.

"You were hit just with an Avada Kedavra by a schoolmate - a nice fellow, that one - but you're not quite dead. Have you ever heard about horcruxes?"

His and Regulus's conversation was still haunting him, when he woke back up in the Great Hall a while later.

/Get the locket from Kreacher./

/Please treat him better, it's not his fault./

/Tell Sirius, I regret what happened. But I don't regret how I died./

Everything else was soon drowned out by the chaos around him. There was screaming, shouting, sobbing and when Harry tried to clamp his palms over his ears with a whimper, there was even more.

"HE- HE JUST MOVED! HE'S ALIVE! HE'S ALIVE!"

"Yes, I'm alive. Now be quiet and help me up."

Harry had much to do, after all.

In fanon, pretty much her entire role can be summed up as "Token Good Slytherin" unless it's a "slytherin good, gryffindor bad" kinda fic to begin with.

Canon supplies many more likely characters to begin with - Draco Malfoy and either of his bookends, Pansy Parkinson, Theodore Nott...

***** You're taking my words as the /opposite/ of what I'm saying (though I left the actual conclusion un-said - I thought it was implied enough), so let's break it down.

- Fanon Daphne is "the good Slytherin".
- There are several Slytherin characters more likely, canonically /and/ in fanon, to fire off a Killing Curse at Harry the first opportunity they get.
- Therefore, Daphne is unlikely to be used for a "random Death Eater wannabe AK's Harry in the great hall" prompt.

TL;DR I'm telling the original commenter that their worry is unfounded /because/ fanon.
