** linkffn(10639968): A WBWL one-shot with two sequels on the author's page. Voldemort is permanently dead, and Harry suffered from significant neglect. Dumbledore, whose only involvement in the Potter family was a warning that Death Eaters might come after the other son, is absolutely horrified. He takes on a role as a mentor figure to help Harry achieve his dreams. It's my absolute favorite fic of the WBWL genre because it really isn't part of the genre. There's no revenge, or major bashing, or weird lordship wankery. Just a neglected kid learning to be okay and trusting his found family.

**** I read negligentia on this recommendation.

It was super depressing cos the neglectors were James, lily and Sirius. It just didnt ring true. And I went in thinking it was durseley's neglect.

Also, his friends and GF seemed super boring.

In fact, it read like someone who has decided to cut their unconventional parents out of their life, and are living the most conventional life ever (stepford wife type of life with money and blonde wife) and are telling themselves they lead a good life.

Thats what was so depressing. I kept sensing an impending breakdown :(

******** There are a few that are pretty good actually. I've recently found one called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13361948/1/Genius-Fratris][Genius Fratris]]. It's great! No major bashing of anyone really, and while there's only one Potter parent (James), he's pretty great in that role (though still an annoying character). The plot to the story itself doesn't really revolve around the WBWL thing but rather just Harry, independent of the label/mantle but also spurred on by the lack of it. He also has selective mutism, and I think it's characterized quite tastefully in the fic.

** That's just long-term revenge, because ultimately Harry will be the one his elderly parents and his stupid sibling have to rely upon, because he's the only competent child they have who can take care of the family.

It can only end two ways: either James is forced to make Harry the head of the family because to do otherwise would destroy the family, or James makes Harold or Hubert or Hueverthefuck the head of the family anyway, and Harry gets to watch the family self-destruct in front of his parents' faces, secure in the fact that he still has a future no matter what.

There is no way to lose. It's a win-win no matter what happens.

** Lily and James Potter would always say that they loved their children equally. Little Emily Potter was their pride and joy, always sunny and bright, talented with potions and charms, and always heeded her parents warnings. Harry Potter was her loving brother who always defended her and, as his parents always said, would die before letting someone get to Emily, but he attracted trouble like it was going out of style.

And, with all the Death Eaters being convinced Emily killed their master, they had quite enough trouble /without/ Harry poking his nose into everything under the sun, especially as they thought he influenced Emily to do the same.

Of course, they always told the story of how Emily saved their lives whenever it came up. Harry's scar must have been the debris, they said â€˜but don't worry, you have other talents - your magic kicked in to protect you both from being crushed!'

Harry didn't mind in the beginning. He loved his sister and she loved him, and for as long as he could remember he had lived in her shadow.

Of course, it was a bit bothersome that he felt he couldn't do anything she'd done before for fear of being seen as imitating her, but that was his own fault - well, his and those reporters fishing for that angle. After all, nobody had ever /told/ him he shouldn't do something for that reason, they had just... steered him away from it saying he shouldn't â€˜betray his nature' or something similar that boiled down to â€˜be yourself'. It wasn't their fault he felt that way about it, and he knew they'd vehemently deny it if he asked.

In the train, he deliberately sought another cabin from hers, and met Ron Weasley, who told him about his own experience living in siblings' shadows, and Harry could relate to that. Ron thought his scar was â€˜wicked!' and asked if he could remember anything from that night. Harry enjoyed recounting the family story for him, but said he didn't remember a thing from it.

â€˜Maybe Emily does,' he added. â€˜But she never told me.'

â€˜Your sister is pretty amazing,' Ron said. â€˜She's trying to bring that Malfoy kid to her point of view.'

â€˜Is she?' Harry said, not particularly interested. Emily was always doing that, trying to convert others to her point of view. Sometimes it worked, but usually it had either no effect, or the other person convinced her that she was wrong.

â€˜That kid's trouble,' Ron said, frowning. â€˜Aren't you worried?'

Harry stared. â€˜She defeated Voldemort as a /baby/,' he said. â€˜You think she can't handle some posh brat?'

â€˜Fair enough,' Ron muttered, before changing the subject.

Harry would regret that later, for when they arrived he saw her talking animatedly to Draco, who merely looked at him and sniffed. It did not seem like she was trying to convince him how wrong he was, but rather the opposite; she was nodding along, gesturing and occasionally laughing. They were with two lumps of muscle, one small pug in the shape of a sulking girl, and a bored looking guy standing to the side.

Not much later, he had to watch with sorrow how she went to Slytherin. He himself still chose Gryffindor.

At first, the differing Houses didn't deter them: they shared plenty of lessons, after all. Emily told him and her parents that she wanted to be recognized for things she actually /did/ and everyone was quite understanding of that. James told him she was still their all-loving daughter and that Houses didn't matter anyway, since in the war they had worked with people of all houses and backgrounds, but he sounded like he was trying to convince himself more than anyone. Harry didn't have the heart to tell him she was constantly in Draco's company, not the vile stuff Draco spouted.

****** Pt 2

â€˜Leave them alone!'

It was Emily. Malfoy turned around in surprise, still holding the Remembranceball, which colored a bright red.

â€˜You're alienating a pure blood and the twin of the Girl-who-Lived, if not three-quarters of the school,' she began calmly. â€˜For no good reason that I can see. Would your father think this the work of the politically savvy heir you think he desires?'

â€˜Longbottom's practically a Squib, he deserves it,' Malfoy snarled. â€˜Even in his own House he's a laughing stock. What's he gonna do against me? And your brother was too weak to stand up against the Dark Lord!'

â€˜Well, neither of us did,' Emily observed. â€˜At best, we /sat/ against him, and I still managed to destroy him.' The threat was obvious: /imagine what I might do against you./ Harry stared at his sister. He had always known she had more compassion than sense, but rarely to the point that she got into trouble. He had expected being in Slytherin would have reinforced that trait.

â€˜Well, if you're so hellbent on helping out Squibs,' Malfoy began, walking to his broom, â€˜why don't you come get it!'

With that, he jumped on and floated up. Harry half-expected Emily to go after it, but he could see she was still debating it, while he had realized that there was no time to think. He climbed his own broom and shot upwards like a cork out of a bottle.

Malfoy deftly avoided him, pulling up higher and staying there. It continued like that for a while, as both were equally matched.

â€˜Well, if you want it /that/ bad,' he drawled at last, lifting the Remembranceball.

â€˜No, give it -â€˜ but before Harry could finish that sentence, Draco had thrown the ball down. Harry dove. He was gaining on it... â€˜Just a little faster,' he hissed, when he saw Malfoy doing the same. /You've/ got /to be kidding me/,' he thought. â€˜Couldn't part with your love, Malfoy?'

â€˜It's your /sister/,' Malfoy hissed, stretching out his hand, but not at the ball. Harry, slightly confused, focused back on the ball. Just before the ball hit the ground, Harry caught it and saw Draco catch what he was after as well, after a admittedly daring dive; his wand. He looked back at Emily, who merely glared at Malfoy.

â€˜/What?!/'

â€˜I set out to kill you,' the face at the back of Quirrel's head repeated calmly. â€˜How do you /think/ you got that scar?'

â€˜B-but what about Emily?'

â€˜Emily? You mean that redhead?'

Voldemort looked slightly puzzled, a feat that's hard to pull off without eyebrows, Harry noted. â€˜Nah, she was just collateral. Now, give me the Stone, boy.'

â€˜I don't have it.'

â€˜/Liar/,' Voldemort hissed.

â€˜No, really,' he insisted.

â€˜Kill the boy,' Voldemort said indifferently. Quirrel turned around and lunged for Harry's throat, and instinctively Harry held out his arms. There was a agonizing scream as blisters began to form all over Quirrel's face, and then everything turned black.

â€˜Hello Harry.'

Harry opened his eyes fully. â€˜Dumbledore,' he panted. â€˜He's got the Stone! We have to -â€˜

Dumbledore held up a hand, stopping him. â€˜Calm, Harry. The Stone has been destroyed, though it was in the nick of time. I want to draw your attention to a far more interesting bit of information: you're the Boy-who-Lived.'

â€˜Does Emily know?'

â€˜It is supposed to be a great secret,' Dumbledore said with a slight smile. â€˜Naturally, the whole castle knows by now. Emily is a bit shook up about it, but that has more to do with your near-death facing Voldemort than with who is or isn't the person Voldemort tried to kill hardest.'

â€˜Her House hasn't given her any grief about it, have they?'

Dumbledore frowned. â€˜While your concern for your sister is laudable, I am a bit worried about your lack of concern for your own wellbeing, seeing as you almost /died/. I think your parents will want a word with you about that.'

Harry heard McGonagall, who stood next to her winced, brusquely say she appreciated the sportsmanship this showed but could she please not do it in her ear? as he was surrounded and pounded on his back by his teammates. As he managed to free himself, he heard a tad deflated â€˜Yes Professor,' from her.

******* Ohoho, Emily snatched his wand, eh? I want more Siblings-Who-Lived stories like this. It's never made sense that one child would be abandoned and outright bullied after reentering the magical world, no matter what the reasoning. The most hilariously stupid reason being "We didn't want Harry to grow up jealous of his brother's fame!" because you can't just love both children, and teach both how to deal with reporters and such? Teach them teamwork and camaraderie, and even if there's a bit of jealousy they'd learn to ignore it out of brotherly love and respect.

Their parents had been preoccupied with his brothers upbringing it wasn't to say that they didn't love Harry they were just more focused on Jamie and protecting him keeping the fame from going to his head.

Lily and James Potter were good parents most would say to at least one of their twins Harry wasn't abused but he did resent the fact that it was always Jamie they looked to the 1 they doted on he had a nice Room food in his belly Christmas presents though most of them were generic the popular things children wanted in diagon alley rather than anything particularly relevant to him.

Sirius As Harry's godfather while Remus was Jamie's was more apparent and father figure then James was he taught harry to fly on a broom he taught him how to read the basics for ancient rooms he taught him some helpful little Jinxes and curses before he started at hogwarts and of course serious passed along his natural propensity for pranking and mischief to his gods son. Jamie the boy who lived grew up spoiled and a little sheltered but not that resourceful or inventive while Harry. The child that was often forgotten ignored but not necessarily neglected grew up with a nature for curiosity invention and mischief Harry grew up to be the 2nd generation of the marauders while Jamie was content to coast on the one accomplishment he couldn't even remember the defeat of the dark Lord as an infant.

By the time they were 3rd years Harry was a Gryffindor? Seeker on the quidditch team? He was the youngest seeker in a century making the team in his 1st year his parents hadn't come to a game until the next year when Jamie had made The Raven claw team as a chaser Harry had resented it greatly but it was to be expected by this point so he consoled himself with the fact Sirius had been there The cheering him on for every one of his games , hIs God father even conjured up A giant banner proclaiming Harry As the greatest seeker history for his 1st game. It also called the other team some rather rude names so professor mcgonagle incinerated it before the 2nd goal of the match it was hilarious and just enough of a distraction for Harry to dive down and capture the snitch by accidentally swallowing it.

Jamie spent his time ignoring their teachers doing half assed work while Harry studied and had a few more interesting adventures, He was best friends with Dean Thomas Neville Longbottom and Hermione Granger. There had been an incident with a troll the girls bathroom and a colony of doxies nesting in the plumbing on the 3rd floor no one knew how the troll got up there but some well placed and creative magic They had incapacitated the creature saved her money and become some rather unlikely friends who spent their evenings on the roof of Griffin door tower. Starting in about their 3rd year passing around everything from books to smuggled fire whiskey purchased off the weasley twins for a few custom potions or some rather ingenious ideas for pranks there were a few team ups over the years the giant reflective Surface of the Lake was transformed into a drive-in movie theaters screen where they played all the godfather films back-to-back last November that sort of thing.

Harry spent his time at hogwarts creating mischief making friends and working his ass off academically he graduated with 10 owls And a standing offer to become a curse breaker for gringots After an internship with their Egyptologist department.... His brother spent a great deal of time being lazy and was by all accounts a rather average wizard he got 6 owls and a job offer purely based on his past heroics to join the accounting department for the ministry office of magical sports and games Jamie turned it down thinking it was beneath him.

When voldemort came back Harry was in South America and well it took a cordon aid effort across 4 continents to finally stamp out voldemort and his death eaters Jamie was a ministry puppet and Jamie was rather useless Harry ended up doing the dark Lord along with about half a dozen other wizards on the edge of a cliff in northern Scotland they managed to defeat him with some well placed objects ceiling him And his Horcuruxe horcurxes Inside a Macedonian puzzle Box Harry had discovered in a tomb a few years earlier they took the mughal option inspired by one of the films they had seen on that black Lake 1 day and but some quick curing concrete and mixed it up on a boat in the middle of the Atlantic sealing the cube inside of it for all eternity and then pushing over the side watching it sink down into the depths with voldemort sealed inside never to be seen again Jamie didn't get credit for any of it since there were so many witnesses his brother was the boy who lived but Harry was the man who triumphed and instead of capitalizing on that Fame or resting on his laurels Harry instead went back to doing what he loved exploring the world and discovering new interesting ancient things through the goblins and spending christmases with serious and his girlfriend Vanessa Hodgkin's a beautiful American which he had met at the bottom of Lake Michigan the merfolk there were slightly more hostile than expected

I read the summary from the bot, thought it sounded interesting. Started reading without double checking the tags, etc. Some interesting ideas, Riddle being weird, whatever.\\
Then, TR +violently kisses+ sexually assaults +Harry+ his fiancÃ©e's brother, who, judging by the tags I immediately checked, apparently thinks that's cool and ends up in a relationship with him.

So yeah, fuck this story.

**** Harry thinks that Tom Riddle is a terrible person and he calls him out on his consent issues loudly and often, both to his face and with other people, in regards to the kiss and later the vow that Tom takes without telling Harry. In a bid to win Harry's trust after what he's done, Tom reveals that he is a horcrux and that Harry's sister had defeated Voldemort (the main soul peice). Harry tells him he will not agree to be in a relationship with him but he will also never even /think/ about it if Tom does not have a complete soul. Tom agrees to a ritual to rejoin his soul peices. The story ends with them /not in a relationship/, with Harry finally confident in himself and realizing that he didn't need his family's approval and Tom facing his greatest fear (death) for the /chance/ at the one person he think thinks he could love.

Bit hard to tag for all that, I think.

  Harry Potter, as the eldest brother of the Girl-Who-Lived, has always felt like the average person in his family of geniuses. He has a plan that might change that, but meanwhile, he has to contend with his partially estranged family as he attends his sister's wedding. And contend, too, with his sister's fiancÃ©, Tom Riddle.
