***** Yes, but to an extreme. When the ability isn't actively healing wounds, it starts healing things it isn't supposed to. Ex: Blood Cells, Strands of DNA, maybe a latent disease.

Phoenixes are inherently /good/ creatures, and the fact that their tears heal is a reflection of that.

********** Yeah, but would that lead to cancer and not just too something like biological immortality? (If all the damage your body accumulates constantly would constantly be fixed, then you can't die unless someone cuts off your head, destroys your heart or blows you up completely!)

** The reason Deadpool looks like he is not because of his healing factor. He had cancer before the operation that turned him into who he is and in the process that gave him his healing factor also supercharged his cancer. His healing factor prevents the harmful effects of cancer on his body but does not cure his disgusting looks because as far as the healing factor is concerned it is not harmful to his body. Phonix tears in Harry's body can't act the same way for a couple of reason. firstly, the method they heal is different from the deadpools. Second, Harry does not have cancer. I don't think wizards even can get cancer. Magic in their blood makes them pretty hardy against that kind of thing. Third, even against all odds something like what you want happens, with magic they can pretty much flush it out of his system and heal his cancer looks with magic as it is not dark magic blocking the healing in his wounds.

*** Secret Invasion showed that it's actually the other way around. Wade's cancer keeps his healing factor in check, since it doesn't have a limit. When the Skrulls gave Wade's healing factor to their Super-Skrulls without the cancer, they eventually exploded from the rampant regeneration. (Also, the cancer made him unpalatable to zombies.)

*** People confuse healing with regeneration. Regeneration is a specific form of healing, wherein the tissues repair themselves of damage be creating new tissue. Healing is a broad category that covers everything from stitching up open wounds to bringing a person back from death. (A necromancer is just a late healer.)

  When cells of the body at a particular site start to grow out of control, they may become cancerous. Cancer cell growth is different from normal cell growth. Instead of dying, cancer cells continue to grow and form new, abnormal cells.
#+end_quote

This being said, the healing factor might focus on healing things it shouldn't if it doesn't have something specific to target.
