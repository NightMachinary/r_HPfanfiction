Im looking for a fanfiction with the main focus of the story being alchemy. I don't mean making potions, or just dabbling in alchemy, I mean full blown, creating alchemic items like the philosopher's stone, making powerful objects, as long as it has to do with alchemy.

I would prefer over 100k words, but I can live with it being a little under. Anything under 70k, however, is not allowed here! >:(

You might want to read a bit about what Alchemy really is before you ask for stories featuring it.

** Linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died by Starfox5) has some not-insignificant parts where Dumbledore uses alchemy. It's good, over 100k, and regularly updated.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - and Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** Azoth. Quoted from my previous post on this sub. HP/DM may not be your cup of tea, but alchemy is a huge part of the story.

  Author Summary: "Questionable career choices, fantasy Quidditch, apprenticeships, bromance, Alchemy, Animagi, pining, a snarky portrait, boggarts, and Harry as a hot mess. There is a surplus of cats in this story. It wasn't planned, but when are cats ever?"

  My Summary: The story follows Harry and Hermione as they go back to Hogwarts for their 7th year, after defeating Voldemort.

  The characters seem vivid, real, and alive. To me, there's a huge difference in fanfic that writes the characters well and allows them to grow and develop vs fanfic that just devolves characters into caricatures of themselves. I loved the characters in this story. Harry really comes alive as a character, rather than just a medium for storytelling. Hermione has quirks beyond just being a bookworm. Draco is similarly well developed beyond just an aloof bastard. The secondary characters in this fic shine. There were moments in this story that literally made me laugh out loud. The humor is clever, the little details make it work. The story has a lot of charm and emotion woven into the humor scenes. I've read a fair bit of fanfic, but this is my favorite 8th year fic. I thought the concept and plot were fairly fresh, creative, believable, and well written to boot. The aforementioned character development and humor and emotion really sold this for me.

  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.

*** Calm down. You wrote this after waiting like 15 mins. Sometimes good replies take days. I once got a magnificent reply for a really odd request a few months out.

It you are looking for alchemy look at crossovers.
