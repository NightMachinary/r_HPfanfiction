** Voldemort has Horcruxes, he would survive a bomb. Further, gunshot wounds are occasionally survivable with muggle medicine. Wizarding healing would be far more capable of treating a gun wound.

Guns are usually rather complex things. I doubt your average wizard has enough knowledge of the inner workings of a gun to transfigure one. Your average adult muggle definitely doesn't. I could probably tell you how a gun works, but I don't think I can visualize it well enough to transfigure one.

I'm not even sure if you can transfigure one substance into multiple different substances, and into parts that aren't connected.

This isn't even getting into how bad an idea it is to transfigure explosives, as would be in a bomb or bullet casing. Little bits of the explosive in the form of smoke will be thrown into the air and inhaled. Those bit will later revert back into whatever they were transfigured from, right? You wouldn't want the byproducts of a gunpowder explosion to suddenly turn back into solid wood while in your lungs.

  Voldemort still needs a body for his soul his body would not survive but his soul would (Assuming he has them and they aren't all already destroyed) and a shot to the heart, head, etc is a fatal wound. Unless the person is shooting at kneecaps, arms, feet, chances are they'd be dead or close to it.

He can recreate his body.

  Most of the wizarding world probably doesn't even know what a bullet is or the basic mechanics of a guns functions.
#+end_quote

Assumption doesn't really hold up. Riddle grew up in the middle of world war 2 in Muggle London. I'm pretty sure he'd be familiar with Muggle weaponry. Wizards in general know enough muggle technology that purebloods don't mind riding a train. Sirius, a pureblood, was able to make a magical motorcycle. I'm pretty sure wizards could make a simple charm that causes guns to jam or even fire backwards at the user.

They can conjure small blades and banish them towards victims, thereby recreating the effects of a bullet. If wizards can learn to defend themselves against that, they can learn to defend themselves against bullets. I really get tired of these tropes that you can kill any wizard with a gun or something.

**** The wizarding world has blood replenishers, and skele-gro. Stands to reason they can fix muscle. Live animals are easy to transfigure because you don't actually need to make them alive. You can just make a chunk of stone look like a lion and then animate it. Like the Hogwarts statues. They don't have muscles and bones and tendons and ligaments. They're just animated. Guns actually need internal parts. And what do you mean by a bullet and a reductor? That would just destroy the bullet.

Further, just because Voldemort's body is destroyed, that doesn't mean jack shit. There's a reason Harry and co. destroyed the Horcruxes before they killed him.

  A small powered reducto would blast the bullet forward at high speeds.
#+end_quote

A Reducto destroys its target. Thats all it does. If you shoot it at a bullet, the bullet explodes. What you look for is a Banishing Charm. But then I'd have to ask: Why bullets? Why not just use pebbles and banish them at high speeds to make them shrapnel like projectiles?

In general I agree that with a cheeky shot from a handgun you could surprise a wizard and get a shot in -maybe even a lucky lethal one. If you're ambidextrous, wielding a gun and a wand would probably be pretty effective in a fight. You could fire your gun, keeping your opponent on a forced defensive, while you hex and curse the shit out of him. Yet, if you're not good with both hands, I'd always prefer the wand. With the gun you have a first strike potential, but once figured out what he's up against a wizard has all the advantages against the explosion based projectile weapon, if used exclusively.

When it comes to transfiguring a gun, I'm of the same opinion as [[/u/Aoloach]]. Thats gotta be insanely hard to achieve if you aren't talking something crude like a flintlock, or the like. Modern day guns are works of millimeter precision to make them as effective as they are. If you want to fight with a gun (which, again, I agree with in general) I'd say: buy one. Or steal them, you're a wizard. Maybe charm the magazine with a Replenishing charm, or something.

****** Is Episkey not just a "tap your arm and use it" spell? Or whatever Snape used to reverse sectumsempra? Anyway, A reductor on a billet would A) just flatten the bullet and B) not necessarily direct it forward as there is no barrel. Anything to do with using spells to launch things is really just inefficient. Just use the spell directly on your enemy. Really the only instance where you could take the time to do that is for an ambush or a backstab, and if you have the time to set that up you could just buy a gun.

  A protego shield can't block what you can't react to~ KingGilgamesh 2017
#+end_quote

With something like Wizard Duelling existing, it can be inferred that Wizard's are capable of both increasing their reflexes, and have naturally high reflexes. Wizard's also seem to be highly aware of their enviorment, naturally making surprise attack futile.

#+end_quote

Or the Wizard you're Duelling can cut your hand off before you even have the ability to aim. And since most people can't aim a gun properly without actual firearms training first, it's highly unlikely that Wizard's would be able to either. Also, there are shields that can be slammed up remotely through charmed necklaces or the like, there are shields like the one Voldemort used on Nagini which was impenetrable according to he himself. Bullets can also be stopped by Arresto Momentum, if used at the right time, it could cause the gun to backfire and destroy the person's hand.

** Horcruxes obviously save you from annihilation, as shades are incorporeal. Besides that, I have serious doubts that a atomic bomb could destroy a Horcrux. The rule for destroying Horcruxes is along the lines of destroying it beyond magical repair, protections included. Atom bombs are completely muggle. They have no magic which could destroy enchantments. We know canonically that the Diary Horcrux was completely immune to water and water damage. We also know that the impervious charm is canon, and can repel all foreign material. So what does an atom bomb actually do to objects to destroy them? The shockwave which destroys buildings would be easily repaired with a reparo. Shrapnel would be repelled. The immense heat is tricky because there are no canon solutions, but this is a society which routinely shatters the laws of physics with no energy cost or repercussions. It would be silly to think that they wouldn't have magic to divert heat.

Guns are pretty easy. The trick is that you don't use Protego, you use a different spell. Canonically, Impervious would work, going with fanon, a spell to remove kinetic energy would work perfectly.

As for Harry's competance with the Unforgivables, we could probably put some it it down to character development. But you are correct, in that the wrong mindset makes the curse fail.

*** Flame freezing charms are a thing. Presumably with sufficient power they can protect you from nuclear fire. I don't believe it works against fiendfyre as that is "cursed fire" and dark magic wounds cannot be healed by the usual healing magics (see: George's ear). Not sure how ionizing radiation affects anything, if at all, though.

** This particular horse has been beaten to death. Repeatedly. There's an excellent thread on the DLP forums about it. If you want to talk about the atomic bomb, I'm sure they'd love to have you there. Last I checked, the consensus was that a prepared wizard of not inconsiderable skill could survive the blast, let alone Lord Voldemort.

I, personally, think that the best solution is to treat guns like they are sometimes treated in the Dresden Files - dangerous, yes, but not incredibly threatening to any being of greater power. In those books, they can kill you, but a wizard ought to be able to block bullets - lots and lots and lots of bullets. In the Potter universe, this would be even more apparent because spells do not draw on the strength of the caster. That's why they don't care about guns.

Using guns in a duel would only be useful if you were extremely close to the opponent and the opponent wasn't expecting it, or as a sort of distraction/annoyance if he were. Otherwise, the time it would take for you to draw the gun, fire it, and the bullet to cross the intervening space would allow him to cast a Shield Charm.

In the world at large, long-distance snipers would be devastating, but would only work a few times before someone caught on.
