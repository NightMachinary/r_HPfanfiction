Looking for AUs or dimension travelling stories generally but especially where Tom Riddle didn't become bad and perhaps even where Dumbledore rose to power (perhaps alongside Grindewald?)


** In Birds of a Feather by babylonsheep Tom's childhood is different, and that's why he does not become a sociopathic serial killer obsessed with immortality and blood purity. However, he is still ruthless and cynical, but not in a one-dimensional way, and also grows as a person. The story is also very well written, one of the most high-quality stories out there. linkffn(13103526)

  In 1935, Hermione Granger meets a boy who despises fairy stories, liars, and mediocrity. He offers her a deal of mutual convenience, and soon a tentative friendship forms---if Tom would ever lower himself to call anyone a "friend". But whatever they have, it's something special, and if there's anyone who can appreciate Specialness, it's Tom Riddle. (1930's Childhood Friends AU)

** I adore this AU, but it's sadly been abandoned: Reign of the Serpent, linkffn(9783012). I'm fairly sure that it didn't end on a cliffhanger, and it's rather lengthy. Dumbledore is in the wind, and Tom Riddle is the headmaster of Hogwarts.

  A chance meeting and Albus and Gellert would become inseparable friends, until the death of Albus' sister. But what if Ariana had survived? Almost a century later, a boy named Harry Potter would survive the Killing Curse, finally bringing an end to Grindelwald's war. Now, as he finds a place for himself at Hogwarts, there are signs that suggest that the war might not truly be over.

** Well... since someone brought up what I assume is Hermione time traveling to be Tom's adopted mother in hopes of changing things, I present you with:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12304702/1/Red-Right-Hand][/Red Right Hand/]] If you can get through the Hermione centric chunks, you'll eventually get a glimpse of where and what Tom ends up at. All I'll say is that it's bittersweet in a nature vs nurture sort of way. Story is complete.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15430560/chapters/35816418][/In the Bleak Midwinter/]] Tom Riddle Jr. is rescued from Wools Orphanage by Hermione, and she pays Tom Riddle Sr. a visit that'll irrevocably change his life. Very Riddle family centric. Tom Riddle Sr.'s antics really sell the show. Still ongoing.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10115976/1/Butterfly-Effect][/Butterfly Effect/]] It's not Hermione who raises Tom in this one. An SI wrecks the timeline by being born into the Gaunt family. The story is Gaunt & Riddle family centric. It's a good and short read, and it doesn't over stay its welcome.

**** Now that I think about it... You might like /Butterfly Effect/ as well. There's a lot of Gaunt and Riddle family dynamics going on in that one too. Kid Tom Riddle Sr. is an annoying little brat in an adorable sort of way.

**** That's good. I'm glad you enjoyed the rec. Make sure you let the author know. They tend to loose steam, and the feed back helps them get back into the swing of things. Or at least that's what I remember. I could just be misremembering. Either way, I'm sure they'll appreciate it.

**** As for /Red Right Hand/, it is very Hermione centric. It takes a while to get concrete glimpses of Tom Riddle Jr., so I'd save that for last. Only read it if you can stomach the wait. I just really like the way it ended.

** Not sure if [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/there-is-nothing-to-fear-harry-potter-au-gryffindor-voldemort.667057/][/There is nothing (to fear)/]] counts. He's still dangerous and radical, but not in the Slytherin blood purity obsessed way. Think of it as a: /"What if Hermione were a terrorist?"/, but it's a Gryffindor Tom Riddle story instead.

Edit:

The story isn't told in sequential order, so that might be a bar to entry.

** Tom Riddle is the leader of a Light rebellion against Dumbledore's dystopian regime in the topsy-turvy alternate universe of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4025300/1/Reverse][Reverse]]. linkffn(4025300)

Tom Riddle is the 'Boy Who Lived', hunted by a Dark Lord, in the alternate universe in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4343191/1/Warrior-s-Heir][Warrior's Heir]]. linkffn(4343191)

In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675435/][October]] Harry Potter (as Death personified) travels back in time and meets first-year Tom Riddle on the Hogwarts express. This kicks off a long chain of events such that Tom never starts down the path to becoming a 'Dark Lord'. linkao3(15675435)

Similarly, in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15499683/][The Unwinding Golden Thread]] a time-traveling Harry Potter completely derails Tom's life, changing him for the better(?) but at a high cost to the wider world. linkao3(15499683)

  It is not paradox to rewrite history, in the breath of a single moment a universe blooms into existence as another path fades from view, Tom Riddle meets an aberration on the train to Hogwarts and the rest is in flux.
