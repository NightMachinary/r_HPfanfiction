A Symbiote Bonds with harry


** There's a couple Stargate crossovers where Harry gets snaked by a Goa'uld symbiote. I recall them being at least decent reads so you may want to check there.

** What's a symbiote? Because I assume you're not using the purely biological definition because then Harry's got a case of worms.

*** he probably is using it as a catch-all term for any symbiotic living organism that in some way improves upon it's host like the venom from spiderman or the goa'uld from stargate

**** Hmm do the Goa'Uld qualify as a symbiote or parasyte? I mean, yeah the larval form that Jaffa contain is obviously a symbiote, but the adult form...

***** technically the Goa'Uld have a relationship that does/can improve upon each and while the system lords are all douchebags there are non system lord Goa'Uld like the Tok'Ra who are more willing to work with their host. this is not to say that even the system lords are parasites because if a person were stuck in the wild with no way out alone or with a Goa'Uld the one with the Goa'Uld would likely survive longer whilst the same holds true for the Goa'Uld being a normal snake if slightly stronger and more intelligent making the relationship somewhat symbiotic regardless of cooperation since it technically physically benefits both beings such as improved mental capabilities for the host and physical capabilities for the snake.
