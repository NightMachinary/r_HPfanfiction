** I'm going to be careful. I've got 3 abandoned fics, 2 that are H/Daphne and one that is H/F that are all excellent, but they are not complete and likely never will be. If you want I can link them.

However I do still believe I can help you.

linkffn(Prince by SallyJAvery) is my favorite of all these. It's not terribly long but the prose is excellent and the author does something truly amazing with a unique idea. A must read. H/Daphne.

linkffn(The Pureblood Princess by TheEndless7) is Harry/Daphne, is long and complete. The author is well known around here and all their work is very well written. (Although I'm still angry about Limpieza De Sangre)

linkffn(Days to Come by chris400ad) is Post Hogwarts and H/Daphne, very well written and is a nice look into what the epilogue should have been not just "Happily Ever After"

linkffn(The Lie I've Lived by jbern) is a classic and its H/Fleur. I'd imagine you've read it by now, but I felt obligated to mention it.

linkffn(Paid in Blood by zaterra02) is the ultimate guilty pleasure that is H/Daphne. The writing is not great but its still a good bit of fun.

linkffn(Resurgence by Acturus Peverell) is H/Daphne. Tropey and not entirely original but readable.

linkffn(Honour Thy Blood by TheBlack'sResurgence) like the above fic its Tropey and not great but still readable. H/Daphne.

**** I can admit that amazing was an exaggeration now that I think about it, I'm not yet comfortable enough with the english language to always use the correct descriptive word. And in my opinion the fact that Harry is Super!Harry is not a problem since that is nowhere near the focus of the story. The focus is the feelings between Harry and Gabrielle and all the mushy stuff there.

It's not a story to read when you're looking for 'Sitting on the edge of your chair' action. But rather when you're feeling a little down or disappointed in your life and just want to escape for a short while.

***** The first time I read this fic I had no knowledge of KHR but I still enjoyed it. It certainly drags on considering the length but if you are a fan of worldbuilding you may like it. The second time I read it after getting into the KHR fandom it was definitely more enjoyable and showed things that I previously missed out on. I would recommend giving it a try at the very least, Umei no Mai is an enjoyable author. The beginning of the fic focusses more on Dorea so you would be more familiar with the HP world before other elements are introduced.
