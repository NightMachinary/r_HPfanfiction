While taking a break from working on my multi-chapter fic, I came up with the idea of the Triwizard Tournament being broken, but not by outsmarting it as I've often seen, but by blasting through the tasks with sheer power. Which brings me to the title. I'd like to change the tasks up a bit, so I'm looking for ideas.

Also, does anyone know how I can go about writing an overpowered Harry fic without making him indy!Harry?


** I've used four alternate tasks in my story "Patron", each with an elemental theme. battling drakes on a stage that's slowly sinking into a sea of lava (although with protective enchantments), a broom race, an underwater obstacle course, and an underground three-dimensional maze, with scyring mirrors projecting the events to the spectators where needed.

** you can do a lot more with the maze, have the sphinx give them a pop quiz instead of one riddle, or have them collect several words for an incantation that will ultimately do nothing.

going off that last idea, have them collect pieces of a wooden golem throughout the tasks which will give them a spell to unlock a certain part of the maze, but there are 3 locks with different counterspells and the champions will have to duel each other for them

** I've always liked the idea of a task which is more than just a physical feat. For example, one where the champions all have to face their biggest fear or worst memory in front of a crowd.

You could have the first task be purely physical like in canon, the second mental, and the third maybe philosophical? Like the kobayashi maru from Star Trek, which was used to demonstrate leadership in a no win scenario.

** Well, inspiration-wise, I'd say start with the fact that the tournament is supposed to be both a display and a test. Goblet picks the best of the applicants, they do the tasks to prove it and entertain people. So, every task should be difficult and require them to do something people can watch (something canon failed dismally at). I'd say the next part is just finding a combination of two things - what it tests and how it tests them.

You could make it physical (test of fitness or adroitness), magical (cast a big spell or solve a problem with magic), technical (in a sense of requiring specialist interaction or knowledge, not electrical engineering), logical (riddles or logic-puzzles), intuitive (poker-game type thinking), artistic (maybe poetry writing or interpretive dance as part of a ritual), Chance (playing with probability or games of chance, or some kind of Leap of Faith choice), willpower/stamina (how long you can do a thing), emotional literacy (knowing what you're feeling and dealing with it properly, eg. with Dementors), an arcane test of mind/belief (think the Gate from D&D: Scourge of Worlds or the Grail from Indiana Jones), preparation (like the Golem thing in The Lie I've Lived), intellectual (needing to have read a thing or studied a thing to complete it, eg. Norse Poetry has these metaphor/rhyming-slang things called 'Kennings' that you'd not get without knowledge of the myth they represented, like 'Otters Ransom' meaning Gold after a myth in which a sum of gold was paid after Loki killed an Otter brother of some dwarves), creative (having to make something to impress a judge), morality (doing what's right even when everything is telling you to do something else), etc.

Then think about whether a task should be cooperative, person vs. environment (fight through a place to get somewhere/thing), a gated competition (do this to get to the next bit!), speed-trial/race, person vs. person (duelling), randomised (one person gets a Dragon, the other gets a mermaid, or wind and water, etc), with tools or without, etc.

Find a cross-section of the two and you'll get some inspiration, I think. I'd also recommend looking into puzzle games and such stories. Apologies if that's quite over-detailed or long, I've been running D&D games for a decade now and it tends to seep into near everything I do. :)

One of the main parts of the 'Indy' in Indy!Harry is him distancing himself from the canon world - his authority figures in Dumbledore and McGonagall, his friends in Ron and Hermione, his 'home' (such as it is) in the Dursleys, or his culture/nation in Magical Britain. So, find a way to integrate him. Maybe his power comes with unavoidable responsibilities, or he can only get more by working with a local spellcrafter or ritual-person to boost himself, or he uses his power to teach, etc etc. Anything that socially binds him to the world.

In terms of financial or resource-independence, make him have to do something that needs other people to weigh in on. Like Novocaine, he decides to repair the Wizarding world with his fortunes and mansions and whatnot and brings in other people with specialisms to help him out.

*** I was actually planning on keeping the canon tasks, just editing them slightly and maybe making it one part of a longer task (though, now that you mention it, I probably should have some kind of visual spell or something so the spectators can see what's going on) and just adding more tasks. Not too many, but again, maybe I could make the tasks longer.

I don't mind the length at all. This'll really help. Thank you.

** Yes, make him dumb so he is utterly dependant on others to use his power effectively, if you manage to pull that of it would be interesting

**** Harry was no dumber than your typical teenager, and there is actually no hard evidence of him being "powerful" the only case when we can deduce he overachieves as far as magic goes is with the Patronus charm. Besides, JK Rowling dumbs down Harry's character after the 3rd book

*** I never said he isn't smart, I just said that he uses his power rather than finding ways around the rules.

**** you asked how not to make him "indy"(independent) even if he was powerful, I just suggested a way to force dependence onto him
