I've just finished mid-year exams and as such have about two brain cells left. As a result, I don't want any stories with a heavily developed plot line no matter how good they are. I just want a nice story with a BAMF/OP!Harry and lots of fanservice. Like those self-insert fanfics where Y/N gets the really popular guy sort of fanservice, but like actually well written. I enjoy Tomarry, Dark/Grey!Harry, Politics/Wizengamont shenanigans or Time Travel/Do Over. Bonus points if funny!


** Harry stays in Hogwarts, but he and Tom have an endless cycle of rebirth in different bodies, essentially becoming friends then lovers after spending hundreds of years with their souls entwined, but still kind of hating each other. This is pretty funny since Tom and Harry are messing with everyone, but of course it's OOC and has a lot of Harry and Tom posturing about how great they are. (But the scene where they realise they're in a lifetime where they get a do-over of their original lives is pretty funny. You don't need to read all 20 chapters though, I only got halfway through.

  Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth. At some point, they stopped caring and just started fucking with people. (slightly crack AU w/ some seriousness) MoD!Harry, kinda soulmates!TMRHP

** linkffn(11669575) Is the first one that comes to mind. It is a bit clich√© but has a surprisingly interesting worldbuilding and isn't a heavy read at all.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
