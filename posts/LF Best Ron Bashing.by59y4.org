I'm looking for romance stories that center around Hermione and has Ron bashing. I don't care which guy she's paired with. Thanks!


** Champion's Champion some else linked below. Harry and Hermione are actually rather adorable and the Ron bashing is hilariously overblown.

** Edit: obviously I regret commenting at all but rather than delete it let me address it by rephrasing my rather insomniac midnight comment to at least better capture the tone I had intended: Awwwww. Bashing stories always disappoint me. To each their own, but it's hard for me to understand how the fandom can forgive a death Eater until he was personally affected, but not an insecure 17 year old who made a mistake when he was hangry, homesick, injured...a mistake he regretted almost instantly.

Original post: No! Don't promote this! Hate Ron bashing. If the fandom can forgive the guy who had no actual problem being a death Eater until he was personally affected, can we agree to forgive the insecure 17 year old who made a mistake when he was hangry, homesick, injured...a mistake he regretted almost instantly? (Rant over)

*** Some people like some plot-lines, others don't. What you're doing is similar to what other people do when they instinctively downvote slash stories because they don't make sense in canon. If an author want to write that, let them, and if someone wants to read it, just ignore the thread.

**** I disagree with your specific comparison as I believe there is something else at play from anti-slashers, but I see your underlying point. (Don't like, don't read). Sometimes I just find it hard to be tolerant of intolerance (and I like to think there was a similar motivation for why you commented on MY reply even though you didn't agree). There are certainly plenty of bashing fics out there for the poster to enjoy.

*** I don't think Ron and Hermione are good together. I loved Ron books 1-3, but then puberty kicked in for him, and I didn't like how he became after that. But hey, I also enjoy emo Harry because I understood where he was coming from. To each her own. This is what I am in the mood for, and your censorship is not needed just because you don't agree with it.

Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it.
