:END:
The plot is Harry and Ron buy Hermione a storybook for her birthday which she can kind of immerse herself into. The problem is the boys got it from knockturn alley so obviously everything goes wrong. Everyone involved in the book such as Draco, Theo, Harry, Ron, Blaise and Ginny, they end up living it as well.

Does anyone recognise this plot???? I really want to read it again


** Is it this one:
