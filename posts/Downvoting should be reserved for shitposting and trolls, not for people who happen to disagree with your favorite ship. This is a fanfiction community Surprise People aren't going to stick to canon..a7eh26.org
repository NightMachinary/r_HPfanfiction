Seriously. Every other thread I see where someone discusses a ship, there's one side of the coin that's being downvoted into oblivion in what is an otherwise perfectly reasonable discussion.

Why you would want to discourage the very like that brings all of us together is completely baffling to me.


** This sub has a /really strong aversion/ towards ships involving any kind of Death Eater -- especially Draco and Severus (which is particurly strange considering that he's probably the only DE that could get away with not being considered one with canon context). I can see why it would rub peopole the wrong way with Draco's prejudice and Severus'... attitude issues, but if some people like fics pairing them, more power to them. Besides, there is plenty of fics involving pairings some people see as ridiculous that can be well written. I read a RL/SS fic once, and while I really don't care for the pairing and consider it a bit silly, the fic wasn't bad.

Once in this sub, I argued against love potions automatically being considered rape in all circumstances, even if nothing actually happened (see Ron's case in HBP), which turned out to be a really unpopular opinion, because I was downvoted into oblivion. I don't even consider them moral, and certainly wouldn't deem them legal in my perfect legal system, merely not rape-level evil, but even with that in mind...

Does it? Seems to me the discourse is mainly driven by one guy with a chip on his shoulder about Nazis, and a few compatriots. Aside from them, the aversion to Malfoy and Snape-containing pairings is just the usual low level not-my-circus-not-my-monkeys attitude toward m/m.

*** The problem with SS fics is that a lot of them tend to ship SS with school children. Ignoring the power dynamics and the question of if you can fully consent to someone who has power over your grade, there's an age discrepancy which is a real issue there. As far as Draco is concerned, you'll find that people really just don't like him being paired with the trio, especially Hermione who he exhibits racism towards throughout the entire series.

However, none of those logical reasons for disliking something apply to downvoting it. This is fanfiction and, frankly, we can do, change or modify whatever the hell we like.

I'm curious, though, why you wouldn't consider sleeping with someone who's been subjected to a love potion as rape. I'm open to your opinion, but you didn't exactly /explain/ it.

**** I would consider sleeping with someone due to the influence of a love potion rape, similar to doing it due to being drunk. However, I would /not/ consider a situation like Ron's rape -- because nothing happened!

Basically, the crime would, in my opinion, be at the same grade as if the victim was forced outside a love potion. So if, say, kissing happens, it would be sexual harassment /but not rape/. If they sleep together, then it is rape.

As for SS or Draco ships, I agree with your sentiments. I don't like reading SSHG teacher/student fics (by far the most common SS-centric fics is of this type), and Dramione or Drarry needs serious justification for me to take it seriously. That doesn't mean that I would downvote people who /do/ read and like those kind of fics (or even ships as politically wrong as Tomarry). It's their opinion after all, and it doesn't hurt me in any way.

Unlike Riddle, they did not lead a fascist coup and later on executed a genocide. That's the reason why any pairing with them gets downvoted. In canon Harry literally took a killing curse to rid the world of pureblood supremacists, and it is impossible to ship "Harry" with any of them, with the people who murdered his parents, his godfather, nearly killed six of his friends, tortured Hermione and carried out their own Final Solution targeted at people like his mother or his best friend without making him incredibly OOC.

You can pull off a believable Malfoy pairing, but the story would have to diverge before the mudbloood incident and then Malfoy would be very far from his canon self.

And here's the issue. Even with a mild sentence, Malfoy would have no hope of ever getting out of prison. He would be lucky to not be executed for such things as war crimes, treason, attempted murder and using unforgivables. And coercion is not a valid defence for these charges, neither is being underage. Just a year for each transgression would leave him with several decades at least.

A punitive justice system would simply look at his attack on Katie Bell, be done with the trial in half an hour and lead him to the nearest ditch.

The goblins don't count in the magical law and there is no muggle equivalent to use here. And even then you could make a case for defence of others with excessive force since Carrow was clearly a hostile combatant and had spent the last year torturing children (unlike Katie Bell). So probably a few years on probation. Or simply claim unaccountability.

Anything with Umbridge is self defense. Defying the Minister is not a crime outside of totalitarian regimes.

Hermione, well kidnapping and coercion, both underage.

Gringotts is a sovereign nation and they have their own laws we know nothing about. But given that it was unquestionably necessary for the war effort I'd go with nothing and compensation for the goblins from the Ministry. Or count it as regular hostility since sheltering Voldemort's soul is a clear violation of neutrality. If you want a historical precedent, the Mossad kidnapped one of the escaped Nazi leaders from Argentina to try and execute him.

British Law is very clear that Duress is not an applicable defence to murder, attempted murder or crimes committed as part of gang membership (such as the Death Eaters) as long as the accused voluntarily exposed himself to the "sinister organisation". Malfoy clearly supported Voldemort before he had to get his hands dirty, so that's even two ways Duress is invalid as a defence in his case.

[[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/14/boy-16-convicted-of-and-of-14-year-old-girl-viktorija-sokolova-wolverhampton][Here is a recent case where the underage defence for murder was invalid, and attempted murder is treated in the same way]].

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

That on its own is not a crime. It is a crime to help a fascist coup, whereas helping to restore the rightful, disposed government is the exact opposite of treason. Harry did not violate the Geneva convention on land warfare the same way Malfoy did, he did not attack civilians. Using the torture curse was unquestionably wrong, but at the same time he can construct a pretty solid defence for that since Carrow is a known torturer of children and Harry carried around a part of Voldemort's soul, which clearly had an effect on him.

He had several counts of attempted murder and if not for Harry and Hagrid, he would have killed two people (Ron and Katie). That is more than enough for attempted murder and grievous bodily harm. And while I don't know the cases you are talking about, I doubt that the offenders were helping magical Nazis bend on exterminating a race they deemed beneath them.

There's some kind of gut reaction that you /just don't like/ this and then you try to come up with good (!) reasons why you wouldn't like this. I think this is reflective of larger issues in society, where gay guys are (rightfully) afraid to come out. Luckily that kind of motivated reasoning there ("he might infect me with something!" or "I totally don't know this person anymore, because of their sexuality") is usually socially shunned.

Maybe [[/u/Hellstrike]] is entirely consistent here and is equally as harsh towards stories where Harry acts submissively or shows a lack of spine with pairings that he enjoys... I don't know.

For myself I know that the no. 1 reason for not caring about slash is that I'm simply not gay. I've read some Dramione stories (even though that ship is pretty bad and ridiculous), but I have no interest in giving Drarry fics a shot.

***** I think I've seen some pretty nuanced discussions about Snape here. Maybe I'm thinking too far back though?

Draco - I think - is a much different issue, because I feel that there's a much larger disconnect between the fanon and canon version of Draco. People who like Snape usually acknowledge his numerous flaws and there's a canonical basis for "good things that Snape has done", where some kind of common ground can be found.

Draco on the other hand is mostly fantasy. He gets ascribed all kinds of complicated internal issues, fighting his inner demons or whatever, fantasy rebellion against his family traditions or other stuff that's *entirely* made up. At best a single event, like him not identifying Harry, is stretched and pulled and extrapolated into the most ludicrous imaginations of his "true" character.

We don't have to discuss Draco here and I have nothing against stories that want to indulge in a fantasy version of Draco, but bringing that into contact with people who are not familiar with it is -- unsurprisingly -- not going to fly. Draco is not a complex character, unless you write him as such (and I have no doubt that you or other authors who favour him can do it). JKR's Draco is a very straight forward character in a complicated situation.

****** I agree with you. I like fanon!Draco a lot more than canon!Draco, and the same goes for Snape. I don't think people realize that some of us were invested in these characters for literal years before the later books came out, and the assumption pretty much always was that Draco, at least, was going to get a redemption arc. That never quite materialized in canon, but guess what? I read a ton of fic where it did, and I'm still invested.

And if we can't talk about fanon versions of characters here in this /fanfiction/ forum, where are we supposed to talk about them?

Yeah, you can talk about them. The expectations are just off. People who favour Draco immediately expect people to understand where they are coming from (why would they?) and people who reject Draco white washing expect Draco apologia instead of just a different AU Draco or Draco fantasy or whatever.

Communication usually just breaks down at that point. It's important to remember that we have many different degrees of canon adherence in this community and people who are more strongly inclined towards canon are just not going to be happy about "shipping Anne Frank with a Nazi" (as it has been so eloquently put sometime).

I don't have any problem with that narrative or this headcanon, but I'm pretty sure there's zero evidence for any of that in canon. The only clear indication about Draco we get is that he's a big old coward and him realizing that being a slave to a insane Dark Lord isn't all that amazing. I'm pretty sure that Draco would still be very much onboard with the whole extermination of Muggleborns and pureblood supremacy as long as he doesn't have to dirty his own hands.

Draco has done far worse than that.

It's not even the slash that bothers me, but rather the ham-fisted death eater apologism and the "misunderstood dark families".

A/N: This is SLASH, don't like, don't read it!

to the top of everything I posted. I would still get rude comments (flames!) from people really, really angry that I would pair Harry and Draco together. A couple of years later, it started to seem like everything in HP fanon was gay! The more representation the better! Hermione was accepted to be a person of color in canon, everyone was at least a little gay, people were asking how Hogwarts would accommodate a trans student and writing AUs to suss out their favorite scenarios. There was good fic, there was bad fic, just like always, but it was so cool to see how the conversation changed over the years.

This, where we are right now, is not better. This sub has an intense rigidity about what's canon and true-to-character that is seriously off-putting. With the death of Schnoogle and Fiction Alley, then LiveJournal, and now Tumblr, there's not a lot of comfortable places for fandom left. I definitely understand where you're coming from.

*** Honestly, I don't really give a shit what that other person is rambling on about because they genuinely seem to be expressing a homophobic sentiment-- but for me, when I request non-slash, it's not about trying to exclude people who like slash, it's just not my cup of tea for reading. Hell, I barely like reading from male POVs in general, Harry Potter being the one fandom where I put up with reading M/F because F/F hardly exists, and most of it is boring anyways.

I don't think "no slash" on its own is that bad, considering it's fine to not want to read slash. Those discussions about "x character would never be gay!" though are fucking annoying, because that's the entire point of fanfiction. People complaining about the existence of slash pairings are annoying rather than just people who don't care to read them.

**** Yeah. Perhaps it's that the one tends to come hand in hand with the other?

I think there's just something evocative about the phrasing. Fair enough if people would prefer not to read slash pairings and say so politely. NO SLASH stated boldly is just, very reminiscent of segregation and signs like 'no blacks, no gays, no Irish'.

It leaves you as a part of the community feeling excluded. The person is literally saying, in their request, "I don't want my fantasy created world to have GAY people in it, I would find reading about that offputting", which... sometimes stings a little when you are a member of that community and this is a space you come to to relax and take part in fandom discourse, and you see that qualifier on multiple threads off the bat.

Anyway appreciate your reply and your comments through the thread. I might just be an old fogey rambling.

I feel like it's silly to infer that not wanting to read slash pairings is "excluding" anyone, it's just a personal preference based on the individual-- and it's not because of wanting a fantasy world to not have gay people, it's just about wanting to be mentally stimulated by the main relationship in the story, assuming we're talking about shipping stories.

I don't really give a shit if there are m/m pairings present in the story as minor pairings-- that's all fine and cool for me tbh, though I would skip any m/m lemon scenes due to just not really being interested in reading them.

Your concerns in general are valid though. I hadn't realized that there was a legitimate presence of people who seem to at least be mildly homophobic in this community, so maybe some people who do the no slash thing *are* a cause for concern-- I just don't think that that on its own is enough to imply anything about a person or a community though.

****** Thanks. Essentially that's just what I hoped I might bring attention to by speaking. I feel like we do have a number of LGBT readers who just don't speak out, and as an older member of the fandom I don't really feel threatened by doing so. (Although some of the responses I've got have been a little rude!)

As I've said elsewhere in the thread I don't at all want to force people to read slash, it's just when you come into the sub of an evening and see boldly in the titles of maybe 5 threads 'no slash', it gives you feelings, tbh. It feels a bit like, the lady doth protest too much. Like if you went into a movie recommendation sub and all the titles were saying 'no gay movies!' (As an aside, as it happens, despite being on that spectrum, I also am not particularly into reading sex scenes.)

I guess I wanted to raise that there's a difference between 'no slash' meaning 'no main pairing' - which /is/ a preference, sure, and it meaning 'no gay characters at all, period.', because I feel - and this thread would suggest it too, as well as some recent discussions in the discussion threads - that some members are quite happy with the second definition being used, and I do find that to be unwelcoming to boldy and unashamedly state that. That starts to fall into territory of encroaching on what people can imagine of characters, gatekeeping etc. of sexualities and AUs, and stuff that I remember happening in the early days of the fandom but which it had felt like we'd solved and moved forward from.

Some girl responded to that tweet with scan of page from book where is written "Hermione's white face". It would be good if Rowling would just say that she forgot about that line and while she wrote Hermione as white she is totally cool with people imagining Hermione whatever race they want. But instead Rowling called that girl racist and fans harrased that fan until tweets were deleted. Then Rowling in interview said that some "racists" tweeted her that in book is sentence where she wrote that Hermione has white face.

The matter that concerns me is whether or not she is pretending she always wrote Hermione as black, and on that count, I do not see any evidence. If one understands books as interpretive works, and this is the general understanding in literary circles, then JKR's phrasing is unquestionably about an alternative interpretation. JKR's interaction with that fan does not make me question JKR's viewpoints on interpretation, which is the relevant part, even if I feel her reaction was rude.

I think the way fandoms see canon and how literary circles see interpretation will continue to clash for a long time. I don't think one is more right, but I also think fans do not always understand the history of the medium they love.

But it literally /is/ excluding a group of people, whether that's the intention or not. You could just as well say that a restaurant that serves freshly-killed meat only on every dish at the menu doesn't have the intention of excluding vegetarians. Or that a restaurant that sells only dishes containing pork doesn't intend to exclude Jewish patrons.

What if both of those restaurants in my example insisted that they don't /intend/ to exclude those groups, they're a restaurant for everyone! /Everyone/ should come in and use them. While knowing full well that those particular kinds of people will be excluded by definition. It's not playing fair, then. That's what this situation is. People saying NO SLASH, NO SLASH, NO SLASH and then turning around saying "but I'm not homophobic, gay people should feel welcome, it's just a /preference/!" are just like non-Jewish people saying Jews are welcome to come and dine with them at their all-pork restaurant that's open to all.

In the case of fanfiction, the restaurant would be every fanfiction written, and subgenres and preferences woud be different parts on the menu. We aren't talking about excluding fics from existing, we are talking about people searching for fics they want to read. In doing so they ask the people of this subreddit for help. They therefor have to be allowed to specify what fic or at least type of fic they are looking for, so that people have a chance to fulfill that request. The whole debate is somewhat redundant as if someone requests No Slash you can chose to ignore it, and recommend any fic you want, as it is a request not a rule. You might not gain a lot of friends that way, but at least you can satisfy your mind. People are allowed their own preferences.

For what it's worth, I don't at all feel everyone should be forced to read fics with a main slash pairing, far from it. I just feel that stating it boldly in the title can be offputting and unwelcoming. I feel like a solution that made the community more welcoming to everyone andalso didn't make specific (e.g. avoiding certain pairings) requests difficult might be to make sure those clarifications were in the body of a post and not the title. Phrasing it from the off as 'I /do want/ X' rather than 'I want X and /I don't want to see that nasty Y while I'm at it/', when the two requests have basically the same goal.

Ultimately all I wanted to draw attention to in this discussion was subjective experience of the community and particularly the experience of LGBT readers, as one myself, to a community where there might not be that many of us (or, vocal members at least), so that non-LGBT readers could come to understand that POV.

Aaah pride. So proud, your identity is "LGBT person". You are what you are but you want to get under a banner too. /Cor te benedic/, that's cute. What's next, "person of legabitry"?

Thing is that some of us acutally find slash offputting. Even those of us who are also "LGBT people" like me (but seriously, I'm bi, and wouldn't appreciate being called "LGBT" by anyone) find it offputting and distasteful.

In this era of freedom, we should retain the freedom to not be exposed to things we don't want to see, and the freedom to have and express an opinion - just as much as you have the freedom to read slash, just as much as you have the freedom to be "LGBT".

The thing is that most people don't want to see it, and if they /do/ see it they are going to react by saying 'please, no more,' aren't they? Queerness might be more openly talked about now, but it's still not mainstream, and people who /are/ in mainstream culture don't need to be subject to whatever of it might make them uncomfortable.

So if someone's writing a request for a story but they don't want to see slash, /why/ is it disheartening to you for them to request not to see it? They're only stating a preference - the same as if you requested /all/ slash.

Does anyone identify as an artificial and ever-expanding blanket term? In this day and age, surely saying "I'm gay", "I'm bi", or whatever else, is not only acceptable - but preferable? Yes, I found "I'm an LGBT person" irksome. I am not going to apologize for that, nor for having atriculated it. I will, however, apologize that you find my preference for openness so hurtful - insofar as it's /my/ place to apologize for /your/ feelings.

You might want to look up the meaning of "literally" some time. My OED has /in a literal way or sense/, and for "literal", /representing the exact words of the original text/. Just to be clear, I will /not/ have my words twisted by some SJW who wants to make someone look like an ass.

What I meant - and what I /said/ - is that people who are not queer (or LGBT, if you prefer) are quite likely to be uncomfortable when exposed to /some/ aspects of that culture. Some people are made uncomfortable by things that are outside of their tastes; this includes slash fiction, which is not mainstream and is thus the definition of a niche taste. If a lot of people are specifically requesting "no slash", then it's self-evident that a high proportion of people /are/ uncomfortable with slash fiction, or who simply don't find it interesting enough to want it to be included in what they read. That being the case, /why/ is it offensive that those people include "no slash" in their requests?

Note: I also never said that the discussion or queerness makes me uncomfortable. It does not. I have discussed it at great /length/, myself. In fact, as a bisexual, I've done much more than discuss it.

The term, as used in this context as a replacement for saying what you actually are, is pathetic. Why would you give your identity as LGBT when you're at liberty - and encouraged by society - to say what you are? LGBT is not itself an identity. It's a blanket term covering a myriad identities.

*** I'm not anti-slash in general but I've yet to see any good examples of it in the HP fandom. And I'll admit I don't look all that hard for it.

The vast majority that I've seen have a stupid pairing such as Harry/Draco or Harry/Voldemort. The ones with a plausible pairing haven't been very good.

Sometimes you get two characters being gay just for the sake of it. I was discussing this with someone else earlier, how suddenly Remus and Sirius announce they're gay, we get a scene where Harry is nauseatingly okay with it, then that's it except they occasionally pop up as tokens in the background.

But my main problem is the same as I have with /all/ "pairing" stories: they're not about magic any more. Time after time I see a story that's set in the Wizarding World but doesn't use any of it. A story that's Harry and Susan could easily be... Buffy and Xander, for instance.

Beyond that I don't care if the characters are screwing men, women, appropriately-consenting animals, rocks or plants with usefully shaped leaf structures.

Slash, just like stories with a heterosexual pairing element, (which, on that note, includes most action, thriller, scifi, fantasy, comedy movies, as well as the vast majority of movies aimed at children) is just an element within a story rather than a genre in itself. Or at least, it should be. With that, I think we're on the same page.

Let me spell it for you: fair society is when /neither/ LGBT /nor/ straight ppl are forced to do anything about their tastes and can like/dislike whatever and /speak about it openly/ as long as they are not attacking each other. Shoving gay pairings down people's throats by refusing them the right to ask otherwise is exactly the attitude that makes people that would otherwise be welcoming, become annoyed and rejecting your presence.

Oh, and just as a reminder: "Being gay is not a choice" and "you can't pray the gay away" Well, news flash: being straight also isn't.

That doesn't mean I think people who ask for certain ships aren't, frankly, a bit silly. There is literally no point in asking for HP/Hannah Abbott stories, for instance, given that there's nothing that distinguishes Hannah from, say, Tracey Davies. Or any of the other characters that are nothing more than a name in canon.

*** The issue is that all humans seek approval, even if they want to claim they do not. When you come somewhere and post something, which is your opinion, you want it to be heard and recognised. The issue with downvoting is being downvoted can make your opinion vanish.

Avoiding and excluding that, going against what is seen as the normal and popular is not a viable reason. Everyone has their own opinion and we should accept that. Abusing a system in place because someone said something ‘stupid' is dumb. Could you imagine putting effort into a post only for it to be downvoted because your opinion was different from the masses? Most people have experienced this in life where they have poured their heart and soul into something and been told it is awful. It hits closer to home when it happens here, too.

It is even funnier because the Harry Potter community likes to claim they are the nicest and accepting people around, but they are not. They are the first to attack, defend, or belittle someone for something stupid like disliking a character or pointing out something that makes sense.

The issue has very little to do with karma, but more to the point is the masses of sheep are trying to play shepherd.

1. If you submit a request for fics with a certain pairings your submission will not be visible (except for those that regularly browse the new queue) as soon as it is downvoted into oblivion.

2. AFAIK with the default reddit settings comments below a certain threshold are also automatically hidden.

3. If you have net negative karma on a subreddit you can only comment every 15 minutes or so because of spam protection (unless this has changed).

4. There's a sort of 'othering' going on by mass downvoting a comment. It's like putting someone on a block in the market place and throwing tomatoes at them. Suddenly all kinds of verbal abuse become allowed that wouldn't otherwise be accepted.

Teenagers are the majority of the users here who already have a low impulse control, but that doesn't mean that they can't make rational decisions.

Put a teenager in a room filled with cocaine with people telling them to try it, and they may very well do so. Put a teenager in front of an email with a week to make that same decision and you'll likely find that they won't. The longer the period of time necessary before your decision is made the less likely there will to be knee jerk reactions. As a side effect, it would also make identifying bots much easier as well.

**** My opinion has nothing to do with content. Considering I've written multiple stories of a M rating where sex occurs on screen. It's that 'shipping' has turned into an excuse for plot that leads to terrible writing.

Far too often writers are more focused on 'I want to write a Harry/Daphne story!' so because they didn't bother thinking of a plot or anything interesting, Harry and Daphne live happily ever after by chapter two.

This is backwards. Rather than thinking about the 'ship' they should think about the 'plot' and write from there. Then let relationships develop organically and you wind up with better practice at the craft and, likely, a considerably better story.

I didn't write The Pureblood Princess because I wanted to write a Harry/Daphne story. I wrote the Pureblood Princess because I wanted to write a story that explored if I could actually do passable female narration (people flirted with me so Imma say...maybe?) and because I wanted to write a story that told one of the books from a different perspective. Throwing in Harry was mostly just so people would, you know, actually read it. Which would then, hopefully, get me feedback about my other goals.

It's funny how almost daily there's comments and threads about 'why is 99% of Fanfiction crap!' followed by 'I NEED MORE OF MY SHIP'

99% of fanfiction is crap because it's exists purely to be about the ship. Sink the ships and the obsessive nature of them and you're going to wind up with better quality fanfiction.

If everyone is downvoted for liking Harry and Luna relationships, for instance, eventually you'll stop seeing people post those opinions. Sure, the people who downvoted that opinion will perhaps be happy with that, but what about when it's their favorite pairing on the chopping block, next? Or their favorite concept of magic?

They're setting themselves up.

So, no, this isn't a criticism. It's a reminder that everything you like isn't going to be "the popular" thing, so discouraging other people from posting because they disagree with you is setting a precedent that's going to bite you back, later.

And I'm not sure I /am/ spitting into the wind. 171 comments (most of who agree) and 175 upvotes makes it one of the more popular threads in this subreddit. /Obviously/ that's not indicative of quality or whether or not it will /work/, but a lot of people /are/ in agreement, similar to yourself.

Not sure that's an accurate assessment. Most of the comments near the top are completely off topic (which is equal parts exasperating and amusing). The ones that are on topic seem to be evenly split between agreement, dissagreement, and jaded acceptance of the status quo.

** And here's why it's pointless to argue with LGBT social justice warriors and one of the reasons people don't like slash in this sub. See how they throw slurs like "homophobic" around, but when asked to rationalize evade immediately?

Look. Like, I understand you didn't get the response you were hoping for. And I do /NOT/ agree with the first poster in your image. But, honestly, those two statements are not mutually exclusive.

There's no reason to downvote every thread which requests slash, just the same as there's no reason to downvote every thread which requests that this is /no slash/. "Arguing with LGBT Social Justice Warriors" is not the same as /requesting/ to read a story with slash and I fail to see why we would push slash out of this sub.

**** I never said we should push slash out of this sub. Just that people like the one from the screen above come off as pushy and poison the relationship between slash and no slash communities existing on this sub by calling "no slash" posters homophobic.

I barely even notice slash requests here because I never enter those I and certainly never bash those, it's when I am confronted with people like above I start arguing.

I am certainly against downvoting slash into oblivion, both parties can perfectly live together on this sub as long as slurs aren't thrown around pointlessly.

***** Oh, well then you'll find me agreeing with you. Sorry, perhaps I misinterpreted your "don't like slash in this sub" as a kind of all-encompassing thing. So long as the requests are treated fairly (though, understandably, non-slash requests are inevitably going to be more popular), I have no problems.
