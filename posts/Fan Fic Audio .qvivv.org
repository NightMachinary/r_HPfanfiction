** The name for this kind of material is podfic, a contraction of podcast fanfic if that wasn't immediately apparent.[[http://audiofic.livejournal.com/][AudioFic]] and [[http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Podfic/works][Archive Of Our Own]] have some good ones, [[http://podslash.livejournal.com/][PodSlash]] is all slashy and [[http://hp-podslash.livejournal.com/][Harry Potter and the Podslash]] is too, but more HP-specific. Depends what you're into, I'm a slash guy myself. Hope this helps.

** I usually listen to epub books and sometime i download fics as epub (using [[https://fanfictiondownloader.appspot.com/]] ).

I got from the android market (google play now) [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flyersoft.moonreaderp&feature=related_apps#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEwOSwiY29tLmZseWVyc29mdC5tb29ucmVhZGVycCJd][Moon+ Reader]] and [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.svox.classic&hl=es][Svox Classic Text to Speech]].

And i use that to listen to ebooks (epub) or pdfs :)

Hope that helps you

**** I'm actually going to throw up a sample of my writing. I have a piss-poor mic though so I need to get a better one. Also, voice actors for male characters since I'm female.

****** I feel like it'd give it a little more immersion. I've been working on my character's accent for a while just for when I can do that.

******** I've got my character's bio done and a couple small bits for a writing meme. Chapters 1, 2 and 3 are currently in the works. I'm writing them kind of in JKR's writing style to make them feel a bit more like the books.
