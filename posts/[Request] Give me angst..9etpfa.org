No slash, no Weasley bashing (or minimal, I know that's a hard one). No Snamione, Snily, or Dramione.

/Preferably/ angst with a happy ending, but not necessary.

Thanks in advance!


** linkao3(An Hour of Wolves by thebiwholived) is chock-full of angst (note the warnings on this one too). In-progress, but the author promises a happy ending.

linkao3(Blackpool by TheDivineComedian) is phenomenally angsty (note the warnings), with a happy ending. (It does have Sirius/Remus tagged as a ship, but it's very very background.) If you like it, be sure to check out the author's other stuff, too.

linkffn(On the Way to Greatness by mira mirth) is a Slytherin!Harry story that realizes being put in Slytherin would suck for Harry. Unfinished and probably abandoned, but still worth a read. (I recommend having tissues ready for Chapter 10.)

linkao3(Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood by cambangst) is more plot than pure angst, but the epilogue did make me cry. (I don't know if I'd call the ending happy, but it's not unhappy either.)

linkao3(The Rewards of Perseverance by Pitry) and its sort-of sequel, linkao3(The Mirror of Erised by Pitry) are Voldemort-wins AUs, with all the angst that entails. Both have sort-of happy endings.

linkao3(Concerning Rabbits by LullabyKnell) has relatively lighter angst, but it's well done. (The ending isn't unhappy, except that you know Cedric will die the next year.)

  Sirius is dead, but Harry's doing alright: between a brand new Quidditch Captaincy, private lessons with Dumbledore, and increasing suspicions about Draco Malfoy, he's got enough to keep him busy. And if an uncomfortable encounter with a classmate ends up leaving him with another challenge to face and even more secrets to keep, well...he's still fine.Really. He is.

When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost.It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels.
