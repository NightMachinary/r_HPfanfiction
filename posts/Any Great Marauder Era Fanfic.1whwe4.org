Any recs? I've really enjoyed Every Other Midnight, which is an AU fic, but it's not complete and I'm not sure if the author will continue. I'm looking for other noteworthy Marauder fanfic

Here is the link for Every Other Midnight, don't get too attached though, its either abandoned or still a WIP ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3998455/1/Every-Other-Midnight]])


** Depends what you're looking for... I know two authors that have really managed to make this era their own:

Wilhemena Willoughby generally writes short (under 10k words), but powerful pieces that are definitely worth a read. They span the Marauders' school years, mostly, but there are a few of Lily and James' married life, from memory. I would definitely recommend "That Elusive Aha Moment" and "The Anatomy of a Bromance". [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1473497/Wilhelmina-Willoughby]]

MarauderLover7 is another good one: his/her stuff spans quite a few years (there's one with Remus being bitten, and then there's one set in the post-Hogwarts, Order days, and then obviously quite a bit of their school stuff). I'd recommend "White Flags" (completed), but the shorter stories are all very good too. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4684913/MarauderLover7]]

Now onto story recs:

CokeBottleK's "All Right, Evans?" is a very good 6th year fic; quite long, and very intricate. It basically pieces together everything that's hinted at in canon, and the characters are very dimensional and well done. There's a 7th year sequel (already over 100k words) that the author's working on now. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8528896/1/All-Right-Evans]]

JChrissy's "Before They Fall" is also supposed to be quite good, but I haven't read it, so I'm reccing it based on what I've heard. [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=315315]]

And then, of course, there is the classic "Shoebox Project" (Sirius/Remus, but focuses on the other Marauders too) that's very well done,and very funny. It's set during their school days, and the authors have also drawn a lot of pictures to accompany the story. It's very clever. [[http://shoebox.lomara.org/]]

Hopefully these keep you busy for a while. :)

** I'll second The Life and Times, and also recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3323816/1/Commentarius][Commentarius]] by B.C. Daily. It's L/J and novel-length, (slightly AU because it was started pre-HBP where we learned about Lily and Snape's backstory), and is Lily-centric but a LOT of marauder shenanigans and great characterization. I've been reading this fic for six years.

Also recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9465821/1/Buried-Treasure-and-Transmogrify][Buried Treasure and Transmogrify]], another very good, long L/J fic.

It's RemusxSirius if that bothers you, but it's quite good and really detailed.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7305052/1/Against-the-Moon][Against the Moon]] is a WIP about the first few years of the Marauders. It's a bit slow-paced (103 chapters and they're in the summer after their second year) but I think it's more than worth the read. We often see the middle and the ending of the Marauder's friendship, but it's rare to find a story that chronicles the beginning in such detail.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5200789/1/The-Life-and-Times][The Life and Times]] is something of a classic in Marauder era fics, though it has suffered from a slight Seinfeld effect. A lot of authors consider L&T a big part of their head canon, which can make the original fic feel a bit cliche.

[[http://fanfiction.mugglenet.com/viewuser.php?uid=46901][MagEd]] on Mugglenet has several really great L/J fics, some short and two longer mystery/drama-oriented fics.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8944615/1/The-Marauders-Notes][Marauder's Notes]] - Spans 6th and 7th year, not much pairing, mainly L/J, and it's written in a form of charmed notes, passed in class. It's a fun read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3503913/1/You-Want-To-Make-A-Memory][You Want to Make a Memory?]] - Haven't read it in a while, so I hope it's as good as I remember, but it's basically a story of Marauders from their first year to that fateful Halloween.

  The Maruaders were not nice people, but what if the gang was as Dark as they should at first glance appear to be? AU Marauders era one-shot.
