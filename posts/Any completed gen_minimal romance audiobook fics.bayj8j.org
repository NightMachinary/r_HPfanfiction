I listen to audiobooks a lot at work, but since I'm really in the mood for fanfic I'm having a hard time getting into the story I have now. I love HPMoR, but I've already listened to it recently and would like to try something else.

I don't have any particular character/theme/setting restraints apart from no sex scenes please; implied or offscreen is fine, but please nothing more than that. I can skim past them in written form, but for audio I'd really rather something without.

Honestly, I'm not even sure where to start looking for audio fics. Any you know of, be it individual stories or a genfic audio archive somewhere, please let me know! Thanks~


** Many EPub readers on Android have pretty well working TTS. Just saying ...

*** Could you link to where I can download the finished audio please? I'm using an older ipod nano so mp3 or something like that would be best.

**** There is no MP3, many ebook readers have a function that they will synthesise speech (I know the situation better with Android phones, not certain which apps can do it on iPhone). However, you probably need a true smartphone for it, I don't think IPod is enough.

***** Ah. I use a kindle paperwhite to read books, and I don't think it has any audio options. Nor do I possess a smartphone, alas.

**** You might want to look into using [[http://cross-plus-a.com/bconsole.htm][Balabolka]] and a voice you find somewhere else (I myself use IVONA Brian).

=-c -w "e:\readContent.wav" -s 0 -n brian=

is the command line arguments I use... after this I use Foobar2000 with lame to convert to mp3... which I send over to my (old, nonsmart) phone for playing.

=-c= clipboard (ctrl+c the text you want to have read)\\
=-w <filename>= read into this file\\
=-s 0= read at normal speed (some voices sound "better" sped up/slowed down)\\
=-n <voice>= I got IVONA Brian installed, and it's recognized as =brian=

***** Hey, I know this is an old post, but I've been using IVONA for forever, but I just got a new phone and I found out that Amazon bought IVONA, so you can't DL it anymore on android. Any idea where to get it?

** There are some fanfiction podcasts you may be able to check out. I personally like FanaticalFics but they do mostly oneshots written 10+ years ago but they are amusing to listen to. I think they only have 1 or 2 â€˜adult' ones and they disclaim it at the beginning so you could skip it.

** If you are interested in other fandoms, I would suggest this:

[[http://audiofic.jinjurly.com/student-prince]]

It's a modern day BBC Merlin story. Extremely well done. Fayjay did a fantastic podfic with it. It takes about 13 hours and it's one of my favourites.
