** Here's a couple of mine:

1) The Statute of Secrecy isn't the start point for wizards hiding themselves from Muggles, and in fact had been doing so to greater or lesser degrees for centuries beforehand; it merely represented the severing of the last connections between their two worlds, and officially made it illegal to reveal the existence of magic to the mundane world at large.

2) The foundation of Hogwarts Castle, and the town of Hogsmeade, was initially an attempt to gather together all wizards and witches in the British Isles into one place with an eye towards creating a semi-independant magical city-state in the Scottish Highlands; which would later be refined to creating a safe haven for all wizards and witches (regardless of their familial origin) fleeing suspicion and/or persecution from/by their Muggle neighbours.

3) Salazar Slytherin didn't /actually/ hate Muggleborns, he was just against letting them return to their Muggle families after they began their studies in magic; and was in fact one of the first people calling for what would eventually be codified as the Statute of Secrecy. The reason for his vilification in the history books is because Godric Gryffindor was infamous for his pettyness.

** I had a funny idea the other day, which was that Gengis Khan had magical blood in him, but which didn't manifest itself into wizardry for whatever reason, same as Heracles, Alexander the Great, etc. Their magic twisted into a different shape, reinforcing their body and mind instead of their soul, which resulted in people with greatly enhanced physical aspects and mental acuity. Gengis, then, is responsible for a large part of magical blood in europe, as well as the disproportionate number of muggleborns found there.

I also had an interesting thought - where did magic use in humans originate? I have two theories, both of which I like equally:

- It was created when the Neanderthal genes mixed with Homo Sapiens genes. Some combination of them opened the latent potential in the resulting humans, making them wizards. Today, there is little neanderthal genetic material remaining in humans, though magic itself has already suffused the entire species in a way that can never be taken away. The two genetic profiles mixing was the catalyst moment.

- Humanity evolved from a common ancestor who was somewhat of an ape, out in the jungles of central africa. However, this theory says that ape was magical. They could manipulate heat, and start fires when threatened. Over the millennia, they slowly evolved out of the trees and walked into the savannah, where they honed their magical abilities. There, they wandered as nomads for eons before finally making that last leap, and twisting their magic into the shape that would eventually lead to what it is today: They learned to manipulate heat and fire through symbolism and metaphor, as that is what separates human wizards from all other magical species, just like immortality seperates phoenixes from all other magical species. A vestige of this original heritage is still present in modern humanity - their magic feels warm; the strongest spell they are capable of is Fiendfyre; they are the only sapient magical species a Phoenix will tolerate living with. It's also mirrored in many creation myths, like the greek one, where Prometheus gave fire to humans, and the human soul is described as a flame, or the nordic one, where two great realms crashed together in the primeval darkness - primordial cold and primordial heat.

Magic itself originates from The Big Bang, and eventually Stars. A star can in theory fulfill most of the criteria of life, and I posit that they are an immensely magical form of life. Their matter and energy radiates outwards, lashing planets and the entire universe in chaotic waves of wild magic, which saturated Earth in the ancient past and led to Abiogenesis, the start of life. Life is inherently a magical thing because of this happenstance. And because star matter is what makes up the entire universe, even our planet and our bodies, some of this immensely powerful force lingered within the matter making up everything, eventually giving all magical species a fragment of the infinite energies present at the moment of creation, and carried over the billions of years through stars and planets and eventually into their bodies.

*** The Genghis Khan idea is neat, but the "Neanderthal mixing" makes no sense. Apart from the fact that it would mean that no pure African (100% Homo sapiens sapiens) could have magic, it also doesn't account for magical animals and plants. I suppose mixing with Denisovans or other archaic humans could have provided magic for Asians.

Traits aren't always (or, maybe even often) controlled by single genes, and just having a gene or a gene sequence doesn't always mean the trait expresses itself. The more vital something is to earth-style life, the earlier it appears in DNA. That's how scientists estimate how long ago different plants/animals started evolving separately. We have gene sequences in common with peas, for example. Obviously not the ones for curly vs. straight hair, or eye color; they're ones regulating some cellular processes.

This does imply that magic is controlled/accessed by one or more gene sequences that have been around since the early days of multi-celled organisms, and perhaps earlier. The existence of muggleborns and squibs implies that muggles and magical are the same race; they haven't yet split into separate evolutionary lines.

That further implies that magic is expressed by a very particular set of gene sequences, and perhaps requires epigenetic expression - muggleborn are those whose parents either don't have a complete set of gene sequences for magic, or who did not get the epigenetic "trigger" to cause them to become active, while squibs are those who have the gene sequence, but never got the trigger. Or, perhaps, they got the trigger, but don't have a complete set of gene sequences for magic.

**** Tbf, I only chose Neanderthals not because it makes sense from a genetic or evolutionary perspective, but because of the theory that modern humans are a mix of Homo Sapiens and Homo Neanderthal(i)ensis. There are a couple of very neat theories that posit that the modern human is in all aspects a mix of the two, that the more warlike and agressive homo sapiens was tempered by the more passive neanderthal, while the more sedentary and unadventurous neanderthal became active and began wandering through the homo sapiens. I thought it would be neat if magic was also a part of that.

In any case, it's my least favourite of the two theories anyway. I like the common ancestor more, because it means that wizards have been around since the dawn of humanity, perhaps even before. As for your second point, magic and genetics are only tangentially related - almost every species has a magical counterpart, like Kneazles and cats, which can interbreed without any notable effect on sterility. Of course, magic can combine creatures that are a bit more out there, so perhaps magic itself has an effect on the viable foetus being formed from two rather dissimilar species. (firecrabs and manticores spring to mind. Even if manticores are a crustacean, they are too dissimilar to ever form a viable offspring without the help of magic)

I've always preferred the idea that Muggleborns are created through the ambient flow of magic essentially flipping a switch in ordinary human to non-ordinary human. Perhaps every muggleborn parent encountered a fluctuating magical wave, or stood under a particularily magical solar storm, or the child was concieved when the full moon was at its zenith directly above.

This, then, makes it the same process that creates other wizards - with magical parents, the child is simply exposed to the magic of their mother during the entire pregnancy, essentially guaranteeing a magical child is born. Squibs, then, are created mainly through inbreeding, just like a lot of other birth defects. Magic can be used to correct other such defects, like the Habsburg chin and other deformities, but one of these possible defects is the flipping of the switch back to ordinary human. The child was still exposed to their mother's magic, but the flip was switched and they were born without the ability to manipulate it. It still mutated their body, which is why they live slightly longer and can see magical things. And, of course, human magic bases itself on intention a whole lot, so a spell created to affect muggles doesn't affect squibs - not because they're genetically any different, but because the caster considered them different.

Magic is a mystical force adjacent to nature, not overriding it or being subservient, and I find it much cooler if magic itself acts according to its own rules rather than the established ones of other things, like genetics and the like. Imo, JKR intended it to be like this, too. I think it's pretty sad that the community insists on making magic less and less magical and just another branch of mundane science.

** I personally like to move away from canon on the issue of the historical background - particularly for fics. So it'd be a case by case situation!

That being said, I typically see it with interweaving magical and non-magical history being the most interesting. So, big historical events IRL should have an impact on the Wizarding World in some fashion.

That can either be inferred from some canon or fanon details about the current magical world - working backwards is a rather good way of doing it, IMO. For instance, the French could have a more open/less biased representation towards non-human magical beings (drawing from there seemingly being less of discrimination towards Fleur/Mme. Maxime, both of who are important and part non-human). Why would that be? Well, maybe we point back to the French Revolution, and say that wizards were involved in the revolutionary side, applying its ideology to magical creatures. Or, as another example, why is Luxembourg populous enough to have a Quidditch world cup team? Well, maybe we point to the witch hunts, and say that Wizards and Witches decided to congregate in some tiny 'nations', where singular cities might be mostly magical - and using said magic to keep them independent, tying into other european micro-states/small states.

That can extend to other fanon choices. An example there might be how an author might decide to deal with the native american wizarding society - both north and south american. Canon is not particularly verbose on their subject - but some authors might choose to still have them in their own societies, and have to wrestle with how to make that be the case in the past.

I tend to think it's better to think of it on a fic-by-fic setting, since part of the fun of the HP universe is just how open ended it is. However, generally speaking, I quite like having multiple powerful - and different - magical societies/ways of doing magic. So Europe might be focused on the wand, but China, India, and any other magical society that's decided on being used would all have had different traditions and centers of power, to spread things out around the world.
