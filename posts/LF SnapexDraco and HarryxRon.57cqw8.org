I'm looking for something hosted on fanfiction.net not ao3 (I'll be reading it at work). I'm a hardcore Drarry fan so this is me stepping out of my comfort zone.

For the RonxHarry I'm looking for something slow to ease me into the pairing. Nothing too big...I probably won't be able to handle 32 chapters with this pairing, it doesn't need to be a one shot, but nothing too long. I'm just testing the waters and wanna read some that are at least good when I'm not even a fan of the ship.

For the SnapexDraco I'm pretty open, just no crack fics/smut. Again something that can introduce me to the pairing. A slow burner would be good, I don't mind reading a chapter fic for this pairing. Long or epic fics are acceptable as long as they are good.

You guys had such good suggestions for Drarry before, I'm excited to see what fics are out there for these pairings!


** I've only read three Harry/Ron fics that I've liked, and none are favorites but here they are:

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5519225/1/The-Abysmal-Dating-Life-of-Harry-Potter][The Abysmal Dating Life of Harry Potter]]

- [[http://helenish.talkoncorners.net/closeenough.shtml][Close Enough]]

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6458907/1/And-I-ll-Tell-You-No-Lies][And I'll Tell You No Lies]]

I've not read any recommendable Snape/Draco fics, however I do have [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1392826][Infinite Shadow Of The Soul]] on my to-read list and I love the author who wrote it.
