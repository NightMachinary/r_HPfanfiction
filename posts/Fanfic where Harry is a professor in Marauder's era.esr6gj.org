Can anyone help me find a fanfic where Harry time travelled to Marauder's era and became a Dada professor? Draco also time travelled with him and after some time Ginny also followed him to the past. Any other fanfics like this will also be appreciated.


** Sounds familiar, I think I've read this one before! Give me a couple hours im in class rn lol

*** Ahh im having trouble finding it. When Ginny comes in, did she start getting angry at Harry for time traveling without her? And all the students were like wtf she's scary.

If so then I think we're talking about the same fic

**** I think it's the same. It contains a duel with simple silent spells, which impress all the students. Not sure if it's between Harry and Draco or Ginny.

***** Yes, it's the same. And I think there was this mission to stop the death eaters who had come back to help Voldemort. There's also a fight between Draco and Lucius. If I'm mixing 2 fanfics, please let me know.

** I know one where he becomes a teacher, however doesn't feature Draco or Ginny travelling back with him. It's called Narcissa's Chance ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12870119/1/Narcissa-s-Chance]])

There's also a few other fics by the same author, ReluctantSideKick ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1094154/ReluctantSidekick]]) that follow the same premise.

** Linkffn([[https://fanfiction.net/s/12184104/1/Lone-Traveler-Professor-of-Defense]])

Part of the Lone Traveller series but you don't need to read the rest of the series (I would though, it's a fun mostly unconnected series)

But one trip to London will undo all of his precautions. Thrown back to the past, Harry will take up the DADA position and fall into the arms of a woman who once spared his life.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.
