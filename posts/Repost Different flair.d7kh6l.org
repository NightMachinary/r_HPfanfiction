Contrary to popular belief Gilderoy Lockhard was not a Defence against the Dark Arts teacher. Instead he taught muggle studies.

The class had just begun when Gilderoy stated, "contrary to popular belief muggles have become quite advanced."

Several pure bloods laugh.

"You may think this ridiculous but I'll have you know that muggles have discovered the existence of creatures that lived millions of years ago. Some of these creatures would have been taller than buildings. Taller and more ferocious than even dragons.

These creatures are called dinosaurs and tomorrow we will be traveling to a muggle museum to see the skeletons of these creatures in person. Your teachers have been informed. For now though class dismissed.

Everyone slowly left the room.

In the corner of the room hidden under a chair lay a rat. This was no ordinary rat. His name was Peter Pettigrew. His mind ran rampant about what he had just heard.

He had recently come across a spell that could revive ancient beings.

I could use these creatures to become the Dark Lords most prized deatheater.
