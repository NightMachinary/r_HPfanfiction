"I cannot be certain if he ever found anything of Ravenclaw's, bu tI do know that the only known relic of Gryffindor remains safe." - Dumbledore, HBP

"Twas Gryffindor who found the way

He whipped me off his head

The Founders put some brains in me

So I could choose instead" - Hat, GOF

So, there's two relics of Gryffindor, what about the Hat?

**** Two things you need to know about that:

1. It's incomplete. The author has health trouble, and updates it about once every three years.
2. FFN deleted it due to bogus copyright claims and didn't respond to any attempts to follow up or appeal the decision. There are a few versions at other sites, but none of them is up to date (they don't have chapter 43).

So, the best source I know of is the PDF/eBook at [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/tag/2.2.1]], which has chapter 43 plus two authorised one-shots by other authors, and a bunch of typo fixes (disclosure: I'm one of the contributors).

That said, I find it to be a really great story, and I've lost count of how many times I've reread it, incomplete though it is. It has a great balance between Harry having foreknowledge vs being surprised by unexpected ripple effects of his actions, and the strong focus on the people around him and rebuilding his friendships on a stronger basis makes it a really interesting and balanced story even though he has adult skills and experience (he would be extremely dangerous on a battlefield, but hardly any of his challenges involve direct combat, and even more rarely on his own).

The repository has PDF, EPUB, and MOBI (Kindle) formats ready to download, and if you really need something else, there are XHTML documents for all the chapters, which you could adapt to some other format.

** Why to Sort a Student is a Horrible Job linkffn(10756667)

Kinda sorta. The Founders were transfigured when they put the finishing touches on Hogwarts. The Hat IS Griffyndor. Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw are also still living in the castle. Well, Rowena's living.

  The Sorting Hat needs a vacation after it was forced to sort a special student. Sadly, Albus isn't happy with the idea. Luckily, there're always old... friends (?) who are willing to help out. If the Hat had known, it would have stayed home... AU Reincarnation-fic.
