My insatiable lust for the written word has caused me to seek out a seemingly unicorn esque item. A well written, Political Harry. Extra points if its not a smutfic, and Harry is Dark.

Happy Hunting, whoever drops my favorite fic below, will receive a well deserved gold.

  "Proofing, also sometimes called final fermentation, is the specific term for allowing dough to rise after it has been shaped and before it is baked."Less than a year has passed since the final battle, and the Ministry is already up to its old tricks. Harry would very much like them to stop ignoring due process, tossing people in Azkaban, controlling the press, and menacing the populace with dementors.He would also like, if at all possible, to bake a passable loaf of bread.

** I like linkffn(rise of the wizards by Teufel1987) this has Harry as the leader of a faction doing world domination Napoleon style. I don't think it is a smutfic and Harry is Dark but not evil by my opinion. It is certainly well written also.

** Iirc Emperor- I'd link it but I don't remember the author and I'm on mobile. I think it's in the sidebar?- is fairly political but it's been years since I read it, and I never actually finished it. It dragged a bit for my taste, but I have less patience than some.

** Okay not /entirely/ political, but....

post-Voldemort, Harry realizes none of the discrimination in the wizarding world has changed and basically decides to be a dark wizard since they're apparently the only ones who get things to happen. Harry ends up leading a lot of the kids from DA as his ‚Äúfollowers‚Äù and half the time he's just floored that they're willing to follow him at all---which is what makes him such a good leader, according to them. Really nicely written, and I had a great time with the character study of Harry that it kind of was.

He goes the Dark Lord route because he doesn't have faith in the political system to bring about any real changes.
