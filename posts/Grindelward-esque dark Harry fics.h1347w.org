Is there any dark Harry fics with a Harry who is more like Grindelward than Voldemort? Most dark Harry fics for some reason have Harry joining up with Voldemort and suddenly hating muggleborns but are there any where he ends up hating muggles because of his upbringing and has plans to separate the muggle world and magical world more (Eg. taking muggleborns from their families at birth) or plans to make wizards totally rule over the muggles?

This post is inspired by the later half of linkffn(Rise of the Wizards) so you can use that fic as a guide as to what i want


** That sounds very interesting because although I can see Harry not liking muggles and like trying to separate Muggles from the wizarding world more, I can't see him hating muggle-borns and trying to kill them.

** Linkffn(sum of their parts)

I'm surprised this isn't more common, honestly, the only thing to do with the ministry depicted in canon is to burn it all down and start over, and that would look very dark wizardy

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  Voldemort's attempt at possessing Harry had a different outcome when Harry fought back with the "Power He Knows Not". This set a change in motion that shall affect both Wizards and Muggles. AU after fifth year: Featuring a darkish and manipulative Harry
