  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

*** The first fic in the series has a terrible Summary:

  AU. When a surprising discovery leads to an unusual occurrence, a centuries long trend is broken and plans whirl into motion. Rumors of a stone, a mirror, and a mysterious door float through the halls of Hogwarts as a prophecy comes into play. Meanwhile, two men fight a shadow war in a vain effort to control the Wizengamot... Sequel complete. Over 75k hits!

**** Okay. Flye Autumne can do a better job than me explaining it, but it's a political AU where the magical world has many more inhabitants. It follows Harry and Co as they deal with Hogwarts. There's a few changes there. (The Trio is sorted into slytherin. Book 1 happens mostly normally. However, Book 2 has started to significantly depart from canon. (There's no basilisk slaying at the end of book 2, I don't think the diary is even present.) The other story line follows the various players of the game in this universe. On one side, We have Lucius Malfoy and Thomas Gaunt pushing the pureblood agenda. The other, we have Amelia Bones and Dumbledore. It gives more focus to Ron and his chessplaying, and Something has happened to Arthur. What happened isn't revealed yet, but Arthur is dead, and Molly is a shell of her former self. It also plays up the Ancient and Noble houses bit. Ron and his brothers are heirs to various Ancient House. Harry is heir to House Potter. Neville to House Longbottom, and etc. It's quite the interesting fic. Also, Snape and Sinestra might be planning bullshit. I'm not sure on that end yet.

******* Yeah, I'll agree with Deathcrow here. I've seen your fic recommended a couple of times, but I never got around to reading it because the summary isn't very intriguing, I suppose. For example, you say 'when a surprising discovery leads to an unusual occurrence'. What surprising discovery? What unusual occurrence? If you identify what exactly ONE of these elements are in your story, like say, if the unusual discovery is that vampires love fish, then if you put that in the summary, I'd probably read it and go, huh. I wonder what this author can do with that?

Basically, I think your summary is too vague. You should specify some of the more intriguing plot elements you have going on so that the readers feel hooked.

Here's the description for linkffn(A Denarian Renegade):

#+begin_quote
  By the age of seven, Harry Potter hated his home, his relatives and his life. However, an ancient demonic artefact has granted him the powers of a Fallen and now he will let nothing stop him in his quest for power.
#+end_quote

And for linkffn(By the Divining Light):

#+begin_quote
  Book 1. Follow Harry and Dumbledore as they descend into the depths of Old Magic seeking power and redemption in equal measure. En route they encounter ancient enchantments, a heliopath and an evil that could burn the world.
#+end_quote

Both of these are pretty solid descriptions. They give you a concrete plot hook without revealing too much about the story. Your description, however, is far too vague.

******* Hey... oh, I didn't know you were around here or I might have been a little less ... harsh. I'd have to read your story to come up with something better. Your current summary is just nice, lyrical sounding, non-sense. "This is a story about people, doing things and some mystical events happen. Also there are plans. There's some other people who also do things." I'm sure you can come up with something substantial that tells me something that happens in your fic (like that the trio is in slytherin or how it's about pure-blood politics or something... idk)? I'd also remove the "75k hits" thing (congrats!), that's a huge red-flag for me and has no place in a summary. A better place for a celebration is an A/N or in your profile.

#+begin_quote
  Seven years after defeating Voldemort, Harry Potter has been raising his godson, Teddy Lupin with the help of Teddy's grandmother, Andromeda Tonks. What will happen when Fawkes the Phoenix pulls this happy, war-weary family back in time for a chance at a better future. Set before the breakout from Azkaban in Order of the Phoenix. No paradox.

While this written piece is not flawless as no such thing exists. I do however believe that it is well worth a read. As such, if the community loses a brilliant contributor, brought by crude remarks and undeserving commentary I would miss it.

***** Would you mind answering some questions about Innocent? Like what years the first story spans and which characters are involved.

It does seem interesting but also raises some warning flags. The drama/family tag generally implies lots of angsty, tearful, useless scenes. Would you say that's accurate?

Also does the story mainly focus on Harry's pov, a mix of Harry and Sirius or are others involved? The author's name being "Marauderlover" does not bode well.

****** Innocent, which could've been broken up into at least two different stories (nearly 500,000 words, while the two stories following it are in the 150K-175K range), covers from when Harry is 8 years old until the year before Hogwarts starts.

I would definitely say there's some angst going on in the first book but I don't think it's flooded. Definitely some good action and storytelling, and it's not just them ringing their hands.

And others are involved. Mostly Harry and Sirius but you got the POV from various other characters throughout the book.

The name provides a good measure of the focus. The story is about Harry, Sirius, and eventually Remus and their lives. A lot of focus on being on the run from the Ministry and transitioning into other stories as it moves along (I will spoiler that there's no Remus/Sirius relationship or anything too off-the-beaten path).

**** Eeeeeey! Fanfic is truly the cheapest reading supplement at sea, don't even want to think how many I downloaded and read on deployment.

Protip, if you have any more underways coming up, download your favorites or new undiscovered finished ones to keep for later.

Anyhow, review count rarely means much beyond popularity and time depending on upload speed, loads of good fics I've dug up relatively lacking them.

  Power is a fickle mistress. You court her for centuries, nourish her, shelter her from those who are unworthy, and everything is as it should be. But then, she laughs, stabbing you in the back with cold daggers of reckoning. Still, the Blacks aren't overly discouraged. They've been at this dance longer than anyone else, they know one thing for certain: an old flame never dies. AU

  If anyone was going to gouge out their own entire magical core and throw up the middle finger at the laws of time, it was Potter. That was his usual modus operandi; find the stupidest and most impossible option available, and take it with as much collateral damage as possible.First things first: Potter had just rescued the both of them, and had done it in such a way that left him once again at death's door. That put them into known territory; Severus, once again, making sure Potter didn't die.Or: Harry Potter tries to fix the world and Severus Snape tries to fix himself.

  Harry Potter was a contrary creature. He'd learned young that anything Vernon Dursley said the opposite was likely to be true. So when he turned his teacher's hair blue - magic according to his classmates - and Vernon decried that "There Was No Such Thing As MAGIC" Harry knew that magic was real - more that magic was what he had. A Grey Harry story.
