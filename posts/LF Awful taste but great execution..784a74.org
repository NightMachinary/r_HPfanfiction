I'm sure you've read a fic like that. Creepy. Weird. Odd. Uncomfortable. Heinous. Something that Fanon!Luna would say: "Hey, that's just NOT ok."

/Why the hell I'm still reading this?/

But you just can't stop, because it's just so goooooooood.

So, yeah; Gimme that!

EDIT: God dammit I forgot my main rule. Hopefully updated in the last ~6 months, if not completed. Few things frustrate me more than seeing an incredible story abandoned.

Thanks for all suggestions anyway!

** linkffn(Deathly Hallowed by Shujin1)

So this is the finest fusion of Lovecraftian horror and Harry Potter I've had the pleasure of reading. It's weird, unsettling, dark, foreboding, confusing and utterly chilling.

The most horrifying aspect isn't even the Lovecraftian part (although it's plenty horrifying). It's the stupefyingly depraved depths that Lily has reached, and will reach, to protect her son. I'm not even exaggerating either, I've read plenty of Lovecraft without batting an eye, but Lily's portrayal in this made me sort of recoil in surprise and say "what the fuck are you doing you crazy bitch"

  The Tale of Three Brothers was not a legend. It was a warning. No one cheats Death. And luckily for Lily Potter, the promise of the Cloak's return in exchange for her son's life was a fair deal. Stare into the abyss, Harry Potter, and we will see who blinks first.

** When it comes to disturbing, disgusting stories, for me linkffn(7200246) takes the cake. I wish I haven't read it, but this is what I get for exploring unusual ships.

It's a Bellamione fic, but not some kind of AU where Bellatrix is a decent person. No, this is a fic where Hermione is captured and then systematically tortured, abused and starved for several weeks. The torturing is described in fairly graphic detail, as is Hermione's hopelessness and almost-rape by Rodolphus. The "relationship", if we can call it that, occurs due to dumb magic soul-bond attraction which forces them together, but it continues to be abusive and depressing as fuck.

In general, there seems to be an alarming amount of stories where Hermione is in an abusive relationship with a Death Eater/Tom Riddle or something like that, and they're painful to read. Let's just say, I'm going back to my boring canon ships for a while.

** Have you read Linkffn(The Black Princess)

Definitely not for everyone. The first ten chapters are the hardest to get through. Terrible thing happen to kids. After that it rarely comes up again. If you can get through the first ten chapters then you will be able to enjoy all four parts. Part four still in progress.

Edit: Part one is Linkffn(Princess of the Blacks)

** Any fic where Bellamione happens... recently been reading "Our Mercurial Selves" which is /brilliant/ in literally every other way but that Bellamione is a thing and it's kinda incest. I mean all the 18+ stuff happens after Hermione is of age, but Bella is her aunt and Narcissa is so disturbed by it all. Maybe not disturbed enough (though Draco's reaction is 10/10). The author is a great writer and though I wish there had been a bit more depth to certain characters (Draco and Hogwarts students), the plot is intriguing and I'm on the edge of my seat. Also there's soul bonding which 9.9/10 I hate but is actually done well in spite of it being the trigger behind the Bellamione.

Basically I'm a walking mixed bags of emotions, because the fic is very very well done, but the ship grates on me. I have yet to read a fic with Bellamione and not be disturbed by it (I'm always reading because the plot behind it is so good).
