I've read several HHr fics, and as much as I love the ship, most writers don't do it justice. Weasley bashing is irritating as hell, and I can't stand how they just push Ron to the side in order for it to work. Is there any lengthy, slowburn HHR that's actually good? I'd prefer if the story were as canon-compliant as possible and take place during school.


** *Time Heals by anthfan* linkffn(8310754) has Harry and Hermione dealing with traumas in the aftermath of the war.

*Time is the Fire by Oddment Tweak* linkffn(6033933) is a time travel HHr fic.

*The Augurey by La-Matrona* linkffn(12310861) has Harry adopt a orphan girl after the war.

*That Old House by vanillaparchment* linkffn(4703843) Hermione adopts some orphans after the war.

Anything from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/636397/lorien829][lorien829]] but especially *Shadow Walks* linkffn(6092362) and *Bridges* linkffn(8541644)

None of these have any bashing.

** I recommend linkffn(With Malice Aforethought by SP Smith) way too much---somebody's got to, it's still under 100 reviews after 10+ years---but it's a good fit for this request. It's very old, so it doesn't work with elements from the last two books at all, but it aims for the canon tone and does a pretty good job of reaching it. (The seventh-year sequel was abandoned, though...)

#+begin_quote
  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
