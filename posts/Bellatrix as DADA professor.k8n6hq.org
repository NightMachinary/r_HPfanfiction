:END:
Damn my poor memory, but I started a story a bit ago and now I can't remember enough about it to find it again. The general gist was that Bellatrix Lestrange was the DADA professor and pretty much scared the pants off all the students and everyone dreaded her classes. She was sort of like Snape on steroids. Except instead of favoring one group, like Snape did with the Slytherins, she hated, mocked, and belittled everyone equally.

However, the students had to grudgingly admit she was pretty much the best professor they ever had in terms of teaching them useful information.

If I recall correctly, (although I may be getting two stories mixed up) the plot device used to get her in as the teacher was some sort of compromise about her imprisonment after the first war. Hogwarts pretty much ran out of any viable candidates for DADA teacher what with the curse and nobody wanting the job, and Dumbledore didn't want to employ idiots who didn't teach the kids anything, so...who better to dismantle/be unaffected by the curse and know pretty much everything about dueling and the Dark Arts but Bellatrix? So to get her to agree to teaching the DADA class, instead of being imprisoned in Azkaban, she sort of got an arrangement more like a Muggle prison, and was only allowed out to teach the classes (while escorted/monitored by aurors.)

I'm probably explaining this terribly...the author did a much better job with it. Is this ringing a bell with anyone?

It was a pretty good concept. I'd read a few AU type stories that had a made-different-choices Bellatrix Black be the DADA teacher, but this was the first time I saw someone write a story about creepy psychopath Bellatrix Lestrange as the terrifying but highly effective professor.


** I'm sure that'll go over well with Neville. Neville, who is of course famous for improvement in his studies when performing under verbally abusive professors.

*** I don't know how exactly the author of the story dealt with that (or if they dealt with it at all) since I don't remember all the details. And the fic, although it wasn't crack per se, certainly had a crack-ish set-up, which sort of requires some suspension of disbelief to accept the basic premise. It's possible Neville and his reactions might be wrapped up underneath that suspension-of-disbelief umbrella.

But I guess if Neville's reaction would be a huge issue, the author could always just have Bellatrix give the torture of the Longbottom a miss due to a particularly bad head cold, lol.

Although if we're talking about a 100% realistic fic, I'm sure it wouldn't go over well with Neville at all.

Then again, given Dumbledore's history of /questionable/ (ahem) hires, I don't think that would necessarily stop him. I mean, based on how terrible some of Dumbledore's previous hires were, he arguably should have been fired already, or at least stripped of his ability to pick new professors. And yet everyone else seemed to collectively shrug their shoulders instead of blame him, so who knows?

But, I think Bellatrix as DADA teacher could actually work given my own head canon about the character.

She seems like the kind of obsessive, arrogant, hardworking, insane genius who absolutely /must/ be the best at whatever she does and recognizes no borders, boundaries, or morals in pursuit of that goal. Best follower of Voldemort? Check. Best pure blood supremacist? Check. Best at dueling and the Dark Arts? Arguably, check.

So I think while she would absolutely hate teaching, that part of her that must be the best at everything she does would prompt her to make sure the kids /learned/ even if she had to drag them kicking and screaming the whole way. (And she'd absolutely enjoy how miserable she'd make them in the process.)

A student can't cast a spell taught in class? That can't be allowed to stand, because their performance is a direct reflection of her. They'll get a 3 hour detention every day, that consists of nothing but casting the spell /over/ and /over/ and /over/ again until the spell is performed to her satisfaction.

I mean, it's not like she really cares how long it takes. Where else does she have to be? Prison? At least watching Longbottom, the Weasel, and Potty struggle is entertaining.

I even imagine as the years go on and she settles a bit, she'll give people like Fred and George detention just to teach them particularly amusing hexes and to help them brainstorm pranks. It's the only mayhem she can cause any more, after all, and the other professors could stand to have the sticks removed from their asses.

After a decade and a half of teaching when the Dark Lord returns, although a large part of her wants to rejoin the Death Eaters and still believes in their worldview...she can't.

She remembers her first week of teaching, when she caused an uproar by keeping the entire third year class in detention for two months until they could cast decent /protegos/. (Never mind that /decent/ to her meant “strong enough to pass NEWT levels” to others. The NEWTS didn't mean shit.). A shield was only good enough if it kept them alive, and that was her standard. If they didn't like it, they were free to hire someone else who'd be better at making sure the kids got killed.

Dumbledore didn't like it when she put it that way, but left her alone after that.

It wasn't always the kids that made her want to tear her hair out either. The parents were no better. She remembers the way that absolute slag of a Prewett sent her youngest son to school with a broken wand. Reginald---or whatever his name was---already had an innate level of stupidity that made grasping things difficult enough, and to add a broken wand on top of things? She finally had to call in a favor from Narcissa to get that custom wandmaker to make a house call to Hogwarts. At least Rover's new wand---fig wood with an acromantula silk core---was better than anything he could get at Ollivander's. As a result, Roger's wand work improved from “execrable” to “dismal”---which for him, was a significant improvement. Maybe now the dunderhead would be able to keep himself alive for 15 seconds or so in battle instead of getting killed immediately.

And Neville was an especial trial. That boy was hopeless. What the frig were pure bloods teaching their kids these days that they were scared of their own shadow? If she had her wand and her freedom, she'd go over to Augusta Longbottom's house and curse her with something particularly nasty and lingering. She finally realized drastic measures were needed when Neville's boggart actually exploded in class---it couldn't settle on his worst fear because the boy was afraid of everything. The way he was going, he'd only survive against a Death Eater if he rolled over and played dead and hoped the dark wizard would be overcome by hysterical laughter. Bella had to give the boy detention /for two years/, scaring the shit out of him every day, until he could finally keep his head without wetting his pants. Her throat hurt for weeks from cackling and screeching invectives in his ear until he could block everything out and cast. After that, he was surprisingly competent. If she'd have been someone else, she'd have called the feeling in her chest pride. As it was, it was probably indigestion.

And she'd never forget that class of Hufflepuffs---what year was it, ‘91?---that made her despair of the younger generation, and the future of wizardkind. That year, the Puffs decided they didn't want to learn how to cast the more “dangerous” offensive spells because they didn't want to hurt anyone. She laughed for 5 minutes because she thought they were /joking/---I mean, she was teaching spells like /Bombarda/ for Merlin's sake, not /Bombus Corporis/. (Ah, the human grenade spell---very handy if you were facing multiple wizards. Explode one, and the bone shrapnel had a good chance of taking out the others. Plus nothing could beat the sheer joy of guts exploding everywhere like pink confetti! She missed the good old days.). Anyway, that class was almost the death of her. She tried everything to get them to attack---stinging hexes, personal insults, detailed descriptions of tortures she would visit upon them if she ever got out of prison. Finally, after weeks of brainstorming, she figured it out. Hufflepuffs were about loyalty and family. So she came up with a scenario where she played a cackling Death Eater (art imitating life, ha!) who kidnapped their friends (played by polyjuiced students who got on her bad side. But the Puffs didn't know that, which was the best part.) If the Puffs wanted their friends back, they'd /have/ to attack. And they did, with a tenacity and aggression that surprised her. They actually ended up /thanking/ her and smoothing things over with the aurors after they caught up with her (Didn't those fools know if she had actually wanted the students dead, they'd be dead! Since they were /alive/ it was obviously a learning experience.). But no, the Puffs were so grateful to her for taking the time to get them to understand that they might need those spells, even if they never used them, even the aurors backed off. All she wanted to do was choke the little monsters for being such a huge pain in the ass in the first place. But knowing the damn Puffs, they'd probably think instead of choking them, she was trying to hug them or some shit like that, so she managed to control herself (barely).

No, the Dark Lord would have to be on his own this time. Bellatrix had invested too damn much time, energy, and personal attention into these kids. They were /hers/ now. And nobody, */nobody/* fucked with her things.
