** I recently created this subreddit after seeing a thread here (linked on the subreddit) and looking around to find a GoT fanfiction subreddit. I couldn't find one, so here it is! [[/u/FanfictionBot][u/FanfictionBot]] is up and running, and I'm planning on posting a couple of threads to get the discussion up and going. Come check it out and subscribe!

*** awesome! I'm pretty sure i tripped over/found a GoT fanfic sub ages ago, but it was set to private. I've no intention of messing with that nonsense. Thanks for setting this up!

** Is there enough fics to actually warrant it? There's what, 13k fics total on ffn? That's less than 2% the size of the HP section, and this subreddit isn't exactly a hive of activity.

*** I'd say so. Most of the fics I've read are actually on AO3, not FFnet. There are still two more books to be written, and another season to air, so the community is growing bigger all the time. Hopefully, the subreddit will grow bigger; I only made it 2 days ago.

*** Yeah I'm skeptical that this subreddit will get any sort of consistent activity. The One Piece and Pokemon fanfiction subreddits rarely ever get any posts and both have a lot more fics than GoT. RWBY and KHR don't even have dedicated subreddits and also have more fics than GoT I think(too lazy to look it up).
