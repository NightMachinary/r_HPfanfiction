There are multiple canon plot holes that annoy me to no end. And I know for example, Sirius being innocent yet being in prison for 13 yrs is a huge one. But, the one that bugs me the most right now, is Crouch using polyjuice to take Moody's place. I mean seriously? Polyjuice doesn't give you the other person's personality/character or memories? Yet no one apparently realized Moody wasn't Moody between September and May? Dumbledore and Moody have known each other how long? I mean, maybe I'm thinking movie more than book and I need to go re-read...but how on earth could no one pick up on this for 9 months?

If anyone has any recs for good AU fics that deal with this, please rec.

**** I can see Dumbledore playing along to a point, and even if he didn't figure it out until sometime after Harry's name came out of the Goblet, when he did figure it out you would think it might be slightly more important to "rescue" the real Moody and prevent Harry's capture and/or possible death. Dumbledore knows the prophecy (and let's not start a new argument on that one) and so knows that Voldemort would want Harry dead. Getting Crouch out of the school would certainly keep Harry safer. So there is playing along for a while vs. being stupid.

**** I never had the highest opinion of Dumbledore even before I discovered fanfiction. It must be rubbing off on how I treat him in my posting.

You do make a point. While I don't agree with "waiting for the endgame", as it would have posed a danger to Harry and other students, I do see why he would do it. Walking into his classroom one day after class, dueling him, defeating him, and handing him over to the Aurors won't help you, as at the time Fudge and his Ministry would rather cover stuff up than admit the fact that somebody had impersonated a Professor and was working towards the resurrection of a Dark Lord thought dead.

I'd be surprised of the castle wards didn't pick up the fact a Professor was possessed by a malevolent spirit, a cursed object containing a large piece of somebody's soul, an animagus on the grounds, and a Professor being impersonated via Polyjuice.

***** I thin the reason why Dumbledore would play along would be like this: I have a chance to get to Voldemort while he's weak. I may not get another. If I burn Voldemort's spy early, he'll go underground and when he tries again, I may not be in a position to follow the breadcrumb trail.

Nothing says Crouch couldn't have had a moment of outsmarting Dumbledore momentarily which allowed Harry to be taken to the graveyard, and imo it makes more sense than Crouch fooling Dumbledore the entire year.

I think you give the castle's protections too much credit. I always interpreted Hogwarts' invincibility as being more about the people in the castle than the castle itself. Voldemort never tried to take Hogwarts because Dumbledore was there, not because it was Hogwarts.

Self-loathing werewolf who had (to his knowledge) one of his best friends betray another to what is most likely the most dangerous/evil wizard of all time and killed the last personally before being sent to a (believed to be) unescapable prison guarded by Soul Eating monsters. Based off his behavior regarding Tonks' pregnancy, he was most likely scared of the possibility of infecting/killing Harry.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

People gave a shit (see that chapter of PS before Harry gets his first letter, it contains portions of him meeting wizards and them freaking out over meeting him, and Harry doesn't know why), it's just that they have no idea what is normal for a Muggle anything. Wizarding ignorance of Muggle everything is a recurring theme in the series. We also don't know how well liked the Potters were, we only know that their friends liked them (that one is a given), and that people were complimentary of them after they died (also fairly standard).

#+begin_quote
  Nobody telling Harry anything. Anything.

Everyone expected the Dursleys to tell Harry about magic, since Petunia knew for sure and Vernon most likely knew. They didn't take into account their magicphobia.

#+end_quote

Remember what Dumbledore said in OoTP? It was more important for Harry to be safe from Death Eaters, Voldemort and other dark wizards than to be happy. It was a cost/benefit analysis. The benefit of keeping Harry alive was definitely worth the cost of not being happy. Also, he wasn't short and tiny because of not being fed or whatever. He was short and tiny because he had genetics that dictated "before puberty, be short and tiny." His father was also described as such during The Prince's Tale in DH.

Sheer dumb luck is a very powerful thing. Not a fucking plot hole, just supremely lucky.

#+end_quote

This is the interesting thing, was the obstacle course actually meant to keep Voldemort out, or to just delay him for a time until the Mirror of Erised could be placed in position? Most likely the latter, because it is unlikely that Voldemort or Quirrel would have been able to get the Stone out of the Mirror before Dumbledore would have caught them. That's why big ass three-headed dog was the first obstacle, and everything else was a delaying tactic. Devil's Snare, having to hunt amongst the keys for the right one, playing a chess game, knocking out/killing a troll, solving a logic puzzle? All delaying action. The Mirror of Erised was the true trap/security system.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

In the world of Harry Potter, basilisks don't petrify. They kill. They're also rare enough that it is incredibly unlikely that people knew indirect gazes (mirrors, ghosts, puddles of water, camera) would petrify.

#+begin_quote
  Fuck the time continuum, I need to do homework
#+end_quote

I highly doubt Hermione was the only student to ever been given a time turner for such a purpose. Bill Weasley, Percy Weasley and Barty Crouch Jr. all had 12 OWLs. It's probably only something ever done for truly gifted students (Hermione absorbs knowledge like a sponge, Bill became what we can only assume to be a highly skilled cursebreaker, Percy moved through the Ministry ranks very quickly and Barty Crouch Jr. was a very skilled and dangerous wizard) in the hopes that they become something truly great.

#+begin_quote
  Everybody searching for Sirius, nobody checking his file.
#+end_quote

Searching his file for what? Nobody living but Pettigrew and Lupin knew him to be an animagus, and neither would tell. And the lack of trial was something already known. Nothing to learn.

#+begin_quote
  Nobody asking "hey, why aren't we using timeturners all the freakin' time?"
#+end_quote

Look at what constant time turner use did to Hermione. People are meant to live 24 hour days. Constant use seems to lead to burnout.

#+begin_quote
  Know what? Lets just not put our heads together to think of an out for Harry. Lets just let him be eaten by a dragon.
#+end_quote

Magically binding contract. We don't know what that means, other than it means that Harry /has/ to compete. Also, the only person who would have potentially had the power to create such an out would have been Barty Crouch Sr. The same Barty Crouch Sr. placed under the Imperious Curse when Wormtail rescued Barty Crouch Jr.

#+begin_quote
  Lets just not pull the memory out of Harry and force Fudge into a pensieve.
#+end_quote

Do Pensieve's have any legal authority behind them? How would Fudge know that the memory wasn't tampered with ahead of time? Yes, it was obvious that Slughorn's memory was falsified, but Dumbledore also said that it was poorly done. If it was properly done, would it be easy or difficult to tell?

#+begin_quote
  Lets just forget about veritaserum.
#+end_quote

Veritaserum is a Ministry-regulated substance, and the guy with the ultimate authority to authorize its use refused to want to believe Voldemort's return to be true, for the sake of his own mental well-being, his position as Minister of Magic and the status quo which has been serving him incredibly well until the whole Chamber of Secrets debacle.

#+begin_quote
  And the Death Eater we believed was dead? Yea, just suck his soul out, questioning is overrated.
#+end_quote

And once again, Government Corruption =/= Plot hole. Though frankly the interpretation that Fudge brought the Dementor as a guard and wasn't able to stop it from eating Barty Crouch Jr.'s soul in time is probably fairly accurate.

#+begin_quote
  Lets just not use a pensieve in court
#+end_quote

There is absolutely no evidence that Pensieve's are common enough for such a thing to be viable. For all we know, Dumbledore has one of the last ones, or one of the only reliable ones. The only people we see draw such memories from themselves or others are uncommonly skilled wizards (Dumbledore, Slughorn, Snape).

#+begin_quote
  Nobody writing home to the parents about being tortured. "Hey mum, I had detention and Umbridge made me scratch the top of my hand until it was in bloody tatters."

Umbridge was monitoring Harry's mail before she really started in on things. It is no stretch to imagine that she would begin monitoring everyone's mail (with the possible/probable exception of her cronies).

First off: "Yea, buddy, we had to let you be mentally abused for 10 years because we couldn't be bothered to use some form of safety measure that doesn't end up destroying your formative years. Tough luck."

Without Rowling whitewashing the issue for a childrens book, Harry would have come out of there an emotional cripple. And not in the way he is now. I mean in a way that is actually crippling. He has trust issues, but the list of mental issues that would have been realistic would be a bit longer. Kids like that, even without having ever endured parental violence, have a good chance of being bordeline psychopaths.

I also didn't mean his body, I meant the fact that Dudley ran around with the newest stuff while Harry wears his fat cousins cast offs. That Dudley got everything while Harry got almost nothing.

You're right about the next two. However, I'm still not convinced that Albus Superarchmage Dumbledore just couldn't, maybe, think about researching that. Next to his blatant use of students as bait for another attack, but Hogwarts does lack effective outside control.

#+begin_quote
  Searching his file for what?
#+end_quote

You know... doing basic investigative work. Checking the file of a convict is literally the first thing police does, so one could assume any law enforcement would at least bother checking. Then one could maybe find out that, /oops/, the guy never got a trial.

#+begin_quote
  Look at what constant time turner use did to Hermione. People are meant to live 24 hour days. Constant use seems to lead to burnout.
#+end_quote

The issue I have with the timeturner is not that people would use it 24h a day. I'm talking about going back in time, grabbing a invisibility cloack, disillusionment,... and checking out past events after they happen. A schoolgirl gets a timeturner for homework, so why doesn't anybody use it to check out what happened between Voldemort and Harry at Halloween? Why isn't that standard procedure for fresh crime scenes? Go back in time, check out who did what and then come back and jail the culprit. The wiki says the maximum time is 5 hours. Any law enforcement unit that gets notified even with one or two hours delay could use the full time to see a crime unfold for themselves.

#+begin_quote
  Magically binding contract.
#+end_quote

That may be, but why not just let Harry fail at every trial? And even if that is not done officially, why didn't somebody whisper it to him? "Go in, say hello to the dragon and get back out. Give up, keep your hide." I mean, if then Harry says that he wants to truly compete because he ain't no quitter, I'm okay with it. But nobody at least trying to loophole out of the rules?

#+begin_quote
  Do Pensieve's have any legal authority behind them?
#+end_quote

Probably not. If we delve into that, the best you could hope for is a subjective recollection of memories. However, we do also know that pensieve memories are without the brains filters. Nobody remembers any event, not even a recent one, good enough to produce a complete and flawless scenery in which to walk through.

But still, drag the minister in, say something akin to "Even if it isn't /the/ Voldemort, it is someone who claims to be him. We got a problem to solve, Cornelius." And Cornelius is a politician. He does understand that a problem dealt with quietly and fast is a problem that is half solved. Maybe he isn't. Maybe he really is so much Malfoys handpuppet that without him he can't do anything. But I highly doubt that.

I'd still say this is a massive plot hole. They all still got to go home for Christmas break even if she somehow managed to monitor every single person mail (which I don't think the book suggested that). The school used dark magic to scar eleven-year-old's hands. That school would have been closed. Voldemort was not in control then to do anything like what happened in 7th year.

On that note, that anyone not a Death Eater sent their kids to Hogwarts 7th year is a plot hole. School was not required, and even if it was most parents would just ignore that and run or hide their kids. They aren't going to send them to a school with Death Eaters running it, knowing from the first war that they torture people for fun.

- Remus drank his wolfbane and captured Wormtail.
- Dumbledore asked Barty/Moody a few security questions and captured him on the spot. Follow on investigations uncovered Voldemort and Wormtail's hiding place, and both were captured. Wormtail's capture exonerated Sirius, and Dumbledore casted a maximum Obliviate on Voldemort, followed by dosing him with Draught of Living Death and locking him away behind the strongest ward.
- Harry used the two-way mirror before going off to the Ministry.
- Harry transferred his money to a foreign Gringotts branch, bought tons of supplies in magical France/Germany (with helps from Delacours and Krums), and then hid under a Fidelius Charm before turning 17. The Trio also took Basilisk fangs with them before leaving Hogwarts.

Instead, they dumped those vicious killers back into that revolving door facility called Azkaban, so Voldemort could pick them up after a few weeks. The good guys were too pathetic. I mean you should have learned that using non-lethal police actions on Voldemort's torturers and murderers were ineffective.

** Erm ... no, Sirius being in prison without a trial is not a plot hole, actually; it'd happened because British martial law allows for jailing people without a trial in the face of an overwhelming evidence of guilt (and at least superficially there was that) and it's treated as if they'd had a trial and were proven guilty. I do agree that some of those seem fairly contrived and can be seen as plot holes, but that one isn't, and it doesn't speak well of the quality of the thread when that's the very first example you have.

*** But since the magical world pays so much attention to the Muggle world...not...I really can't see the ministry of magic using British martial law as a standard.

I suppose maybe I am prejudiced to believe that due process and innocent until proven guilty are still relevant (though it seems less and less so as every year passes).

**** While I do doubt they'd use muggle law as a standard, the point stands that such a thing does exist, and as “innocent until proven guilty” is something more recent than you'd think it is not about muggle law but rather about the roots of where the current law, muggle or wizarding, came from; do note that many things in martial law are things that were commonplace before some people decided that they were uncivilised or stuff like that, and as both wizards and muggles have “civilised” law they logically both also have martial law which is reserved for ... well, mostly wars, as they are time when efficiency takes the front seat as they might not have time for things that “law” sometimes demands. With that, take the fact that at the time of his capture Sirius was pretty much incoherent and they couldn't really judge him without making it into a mess (which they could have had they wanted to make it into a publicity stunt, but a trial of a wreck of a man is not a publicity stunt at all), it's easy to step into what they'd once had and what now is martial law and decide him guilty rather than innocent because of all the evidence piling against him, especially when Crouch had the power of both deciding if a trial is necessary and judging Sirius if he though it not (meaning that the power to condemn a man was wholly in the hands of one person, and a person who seems to believe that it's innocence that should be proven).

So yes, in this particular case you are prejudiced because you are forgetting that something like martial law exists and that it's existed for a very long time, once as just “law” rather than “martial law”. So do I believe that people should not be seen guilty before their guilt is actually proven (with the exception of people who are committing a crime in so arrogant a way that it would only be a waste of time ... oh, wait) so I can understand this belief of yours, but I am aware that such a viewpoint was not always a thing and requiring people to hold to that because that something that happens in “normal” situations nowadays might be a mistake. Well, that and I once actually took part in a longer discussion where this very specific thing (Sirius's lack of trial) was addressed.

That said, one part that could be plot-holey is Fudge not taking Harry's word and at least arranging for some sort of investigation even if not a “retrial”, as the one who jailed Sirius was Crouch and the one under whose reign it happened was Bagnold so he'd be mostly free of blame, but then again he isn't required to take Harry's word for anything and as sensible as it would have been nobody said he isn't a moron (well, that and if he did accept that Sirius might not be evil, the whole “dementors at Hogwarts” thing could have given him some serious bad rep, though that was his fault for being an idiot as they needn't have been placed there). And another part that could be plot-holey was Dumbledore not using any of his alleged power to try to force something, but that one pertains to Dumbledore rather than to Sirius's imprisonment itself.

****** The Ministry is definitely sovereign (subject perhaps to the ICW) but that doesn't prevent it from applying Muggle law if it so chooses. Remember there's a difference between jurisdiction and law - English courts apply foreign law to disputes all the time. For example if a contract states that English courts have jurisdiction but the contract is to be interpreted in accordance with French law, any dispute will be heard by English courts but applying French law. So the Ministry of Magic can have jurisdiction over all wizards as part of its sovereignty but "fill in the gaps" of magical law with Muggle law as required.

Personally I think it unrealistic for the Ministry to craft its own law on every area of life, many of which are highly complex and not impacted by magic at all. Consider, for example, the hugely complicated law of trusts. Certainly bits and pieces can be amended by magical provisions if so required (e.g. perhaps trustees can be required to take unbreakable vows) but I just can't see the Ministry replacing the product of hundreds of Muggle cases with some kind of civil code.

**** Maybe because he was an incoherent wreck of a man rather than someone putting whom on a trial would have given them any actual publicity? Or maybe because he got unlucky to get captured at a different enough time from all the others that he got short-changed of law whereas the others were close enough to Junior in capture time that they got “lucky” and got trials because Junior got one. Or maybe because Crouch had decided that Sirius, being close to the last victims of Voldemort and his alleged follower, had a great enough role and was a vile enough person that he is irredeemable and it would be a waste of time to try. Personally I favour the first one, but it might be that another one was the case, or that there was a bit of more than one in effect.

Do note that it's not “oh, nobody can get a trial because it's martial law time”, it's “there might not be a time to give a trial to some people, so if they are obviously guilty they may simply be pronounced guilty”. While it is no doubt contrived that Sirius got no trial whereas all the others got them, there are possible explanations that do not result in this particular issue being a plot hole; some of the things relating to it, yes, they may still have plot holes, but that one might not necessarily have one. Because what matters is it being allowed by law (which it could be, unless you want to insist that wizards have no leftovers in law from the old times, which I note would make their law way ahead in years from the muggle law and which I doubt is the case) and Crouch having a reason to do it that would make sense for him and those who could question him at the time.
