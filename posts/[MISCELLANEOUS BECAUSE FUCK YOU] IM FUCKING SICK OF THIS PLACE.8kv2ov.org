** Upvotes and downvotes are meaningless. Reddit barely provides any guidance on how they should be used. Some people use them to express approval or disapproval of the ideas expressed. Some people use them to "vote" on an issue. Some people use them to simply mark their "place" in the continuous reddit feed of threads (guilty!). Some people actually use them to promote topics to the attention of other users.

But if you're going to follow posts like [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8k32p3/miscellaneous_im_sorry_for_being_very_irritable/]] with posts like [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8kv2ov/miscellaneous_because_fuck_you_im_fucking_sick_of/]] then you're bound to attract people who will downvote you just to try to drive you away (or find entertainment in your rants). Welcome to the internet/life.

Also ... I've downvoted this thread for being unconstructive and off-topic. :)

** After I went to check some of your other posts it appears to me that you are a little too entusiast with the capslock key. From my experience it is not well perceived. Ever way your likely having a break down but know that nobody really hate you, in fact nobody really care much about anyone, don't take it personally and come back tomorrow.

** Alma, calm down. Its all just imaginary internet points. I understand its frustrating, but you gotta think about yourself here. Ease up, grab a drink, watch a good movie and then let a day pass without thinking about this, alright?

The Internet is a harsh place for nocomformatist opinion, comments... and even formatting. Can't really do much about it other than shrug it off and not let it bother you.

** Okay, Alma, Alma, Alma. I understand your frustration, but screaming a gigantic wall of text at these people isn't going to help them see you as a reasonable person whom they should stop making fun of for no reason. And also, getting angry about online jerks is never good for /yourself/. Calm down. Please.

*** I can't fucking do anything! Achille I can't recommend a fic to someone I can't tell someone they wrote a good story, or they have a good idea, I can't say I want to read more, I can't give a right answer or a GOOD answer, I can't say a fucking THING IN THIS PLACE without everything being just shoved down and hidden with the fucking downvotes!!! What the hell is the point for me? Anything and everything I say just gets downvoted no matter WHAT!!!
