Plastic has always struck me as a muggle material -- either because magical folk don't know how to synthesise it and/or they don't want to use it. In fics where Harry (or another character) tries to "modernise" the WW, plastic is often one of materials that puzzles magical world.

Does plastic exist in the Wizarding World? Do magical folk have an alternative to plastic? What do they know about plastic?


** IRL, plastic is largely a convenience thing - easier to shape, more durable, cheap, etc. In the magical world, magic covers the convenience angle with transfiguration and charms, so there isn't really a need to find an alternative to glass, wood, etc.

** Well they use [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Gramophone][phonographs]] with presumably vinyl disks in the movies, and the [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Camera][cameras]] have to put the photos on something. In one fic I read (no idea which) the justification for quills was that magic takes a extreme dislike to artificial materials and causes pens and the like to degrade quickly. I doubt that theory because [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Colin_Creevey%27s_camera][Colin's camera]] survives hogwarts (besides that whole batilisk incident). The camera in the movies is a plastic bodied [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argus_C3][Argus C3 Matchmatic]], but even if you want to go the whole "movies aren't canon" thing I think any camera you are willing to send to school with a 11 year old will have some important plastic part somewhere.

*** I don't know much about cameras, but I wouldn't be surprised if most "vintage" cameras (meaning manufactured before 1960 or so) were all metal/glass. Colin didn't seem like an amateur photographer, so his parents might have bought him a higher-end camera that was still all metal and glass. Just food for thought

**** Yes, but consider the issue that he'd probably own a camera with electrical innards, considering it's 1992. It's possible that since that wouldn't work around magic because ~medieval european fantasy~ so before going to Hogwarts he found one that would actually work, which presumably would have belonged to a parent/grandparent.

***** A lot of cameras have entirely mechanical mechanisms with the batteries only running the flash so I think if the camera didn't have electronic film advance or autofocus it should be fine on that front.

**** Ok I can see your point on him maybe having a nice camera. I think you would be surprised on how many cameras made in the 30s-60s are made of [[http://camera-wiki.org/wiki/Bakelite][Bakelite]]. I myself own a Bakelite camera from the late 30s. Broken beyond repair though.

Presumably they do NOT use vinyl but actual shellac records

**** Word of god states it is a muggle camera retrofitted with a magical flash.

As for why it makes magic pictures Rowling states

** Ron wears trainers, which is British for tennis shoes. The soles are rubber, the aglets are plastic. Spell-o-tape is a thing and based on clear tape. Add to that, that plastic has been around since the 1800s. So, they definitely have it and use it.

** I would see it as plastics are a bit too malleable- magic directly used on it might make it melt, and it can be easily corrupted. It could also be the case that other 'man-made' materials are easier to corrupt, so that homework written using ballpoint ink is much easier to jinx, whereas the magically mixed inks will hold onto the 'meaning' of what is written by a wizard more readily.

This sort of anti-plastic bias could lead to more of a steam-punk evolution in enchanting objects, where anything using magic has to be made with natural elements like iron and copper, simple alloys like brass, bronze or steel, natural materials like horn & amber, cut stone, tooled leather and /maybe/ bakelite, if one were to assume the first plastic was alchemical in creation rather than just a polymer.

On the other hand, this could simply be a pureblood bias/superstition and that there's no reason to treat objects that are machine-manufactured differently than those that are handmade. After all, wizards and muggles have occupied the same world for the last 10000+ years. Why would some societal agreement made 300 years ago have anything to do with how physical laws are obeyed or broken?

** I have a headcanon that plastic and possibly highly processed foods are something of a kryptonite for magical people. I've always loved worldbuiling that has to do with elemental magic and nature's innate magical properties, so it makes sense to me that synthetics, being completely devoid of any ambient magic (life), can't be altered by or used with magic and that magical folk loath them as freaks of nature.

** I think purebloods would shun plastics, simply out of cultural bias. I think the wizarding world would vastly outpace the muggle world in materials sciences, using magic to imbue natural materials that had been discovered earlier in history with all sorts of useful characteristics.

The typical purebloods' first knowledge of plastics would be exposure through Hogwarts, and muggleborn classmates who have things made from plastic. The pureblood would already have similar things at home, and would consider the plastic muggle alternative as a variation of the norm.

It would be a ridiculous hassle for a wizard to try to sell plastics to the wizarding world. Purebloods would demand to know what exactly was insufficient about magically enhanced natural materials, and they would have a very good point. Muggleborns wouldn't make a big enough market to make a product viable, because they would be used to buying their plastic goods from muggles, and because they would honestly rather spend their money on honestly superior magical alternatives.

Placing a factory would be hard, because the purebloods would all cry nimby. Finding workers to stock this factory would be hard, because the workers might be concerned that the business venture isn't going to work, and will look for more reliable employment elsewhere. The manufacturing process and the machines would have to be redesigned to use magic instead of electricity, because workers would object to not being allowed to use magic while on the premises, and would also question the safety of machines that can't come with safety enchantments. Anyone with a Hogwarts education lacks the engineering and materials science education to invent tools and a manufacturing process that uses magic instead of electrical machines, and getting into a university on the strength of a crapload of remedial A-levels to gain all this knowledge is a headache that few people wish to take on.

Pureblood parents would be reluctant to buy their kids plastic muggle things that their cool new muggleborn friends from Hogwarts own, because a lot of these cool new muggle things these cool new muggleborn friends own run on electricity. It would no doubt frustrate a pureblood parent, to see their kids whine about how it's so awful that they have magic, because their magic is making it difficult to own these silly muggle toys.

The lack of familiarity with plastics might give rise to urban legends amongst the wizarding world that plastics are, in some fashion, actually poisonous. The fact that even some muggleborns believe this will be seized upon by some purebloods, and stories will abound about a friend of a friend who incured nasty health issues from plastics.

** Weird. I was just thinking about this same topic twelve hours ago. I also think plastic wouldn't be used by wizards. Perhaps by Muggles but I doubt it would become mainstream in the Wizarding world.

Plastic's only advantage is that it's lighter and more durable than metal and glass respectively. But magic can fix that in a trice, so there's really no need.
