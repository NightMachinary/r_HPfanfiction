But it is annoying when you talk about your favorite author and you know so little about them that you don't even know if you are supposed to say /his/ or /her/ (or maybe something else?) /stories are amazing/...


** I enjoy when people tell my my opinion about my stories is incorrect. I mean I only wrote the damn things.

*** Reminds me of that old Anecdote about an author who took an English GCSE studying his own novel and failed it dismally.

You may not have known that those blue curtains you wrote about meant your main character was sad, but that English Teacher will spend an entire term telling you about it. :)

*** "Danse Macabre" would still have been a better title for Chapter 4 of Twelve Nights, author or not. ðŸ˜‰

**** I've always enjoyed referring to writers with literature terms substituted in place of other descriptions. Like "You know, the one with a bit of an adverb problem." or "The one with the cracking sentence structure."

** I totally agree. One of my favorite authors has posted over 200 chapters over several years and I know nothing about them. Not their gender. Not the country they are from. Not their age or job. I have a picture in my mind but it's probably completely wrong ðŸ˜‚

** Completely agree. It took really investigative action to find out that Northumbrian is a guy and his name is Neil.
