Hello!\\
It's that time again. You guessed it, it's Goblin bashing time!

After way too many "Goblins are Fairy Godmother" and "Goblins are Misunderstood" and "Goblins are a richer Dobby"...

Well, I'd like more contributions from the opposite side of the spectrum. The evil goblins. The manipulative goblins. The ruthless goblins. The treacherous goblins. The bloodthirsty goblins. I will also accept a reasonably cliche-free exceptions from the rule, where goblins are not antagonistic, but neither are they servile or a solution to all the world's ills.

But my primary interest, in spite of Cuthbert Binns's best efforts, lies in goblin wars. Do they win? Do they lose? Who started it? I don't care. I want to see them at odds with Wizardkind.

** Well, I feel like they couldn't have won the wars otherwise they would have wands. Unless Goblins wanting wands is a fanon thing that I thought was canon

*** The amusing thing is that the half-goblins obviously can have wands (Flitwick), so they could have had a sizable group of goblin-blooded wand wielders with some effort.

And I agree, they didn't win... But how badly did they lose?

There is a difference between suing for peace due to attrition, being forced into one, or being entirely conquered (with the possibility of genocide if the conquerors are particularly vengeful).

Goblins have an edge when it comes to ambushes and artifacts... But wizards are just too damn versatile. To achieve something (such as any concessions in treaties), they'd need to strike hard and fast before hiding underground, or force a large scale battle where their armor, swords and the like would have a chance to actually do something (I am assuming here that goblin blades go through purely magical shields and block direct spells - but they can still be Trolled (Wingardium Leviosa!)).

That said, the results matter to me less than the event itself.

** It's my headcanon that they had wizarding allies during their rebellions. (Influenced by Sarah J Mass, for anyone else that's read ACOTAR) maybe one house siding with the goblins because their mortal enemies are fighting against the goblins, maybe for love or friendship, or maybe because they just felt it was the right thing to do.

As for your post, I like to think of the goblins as bloodthirsty and manipulative a la redcaps. (If anyone's read Holly Black, I'm thinking of the father from the Wicked King). I also think they're selfish and loyal to their own race in the best way possible.
