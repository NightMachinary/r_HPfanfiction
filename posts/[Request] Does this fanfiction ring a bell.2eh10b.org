I've been looking for a fanfiction of this description: Harry is back from war in Afghanistan and meets Ron and Hermione at a bar. (This is several years after Hogwarts.) But Hermione can't make it. Harry and Ron reminisce about their years at school, but Ron is less enthusiastic than Harry is. I guess I don't know for sure that it exists, but someone told me about it once and it sounds fascinating. Does anyone know its title or have any idea how I might find it? I've already searched fanfiction.net but didn't find anything when I searched "Afghanistan."

*** Pretty sure I read this one. He's essentially a mercenary soldier fighting against some big bad evil in the Middle East/Egypt and they wind up setting off some huge magical explosive and summon demons.
