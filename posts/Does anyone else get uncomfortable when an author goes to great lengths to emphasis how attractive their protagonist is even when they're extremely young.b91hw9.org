I'll give you a quote of a fic I just stopped reading because I was getting increasingly uncomfortable the further it went on.

#+begin_quote
  Dressed fully in Muggle clothes she drew stares from passersby, with her skinny fit jeans, black leather boots, black leather jacket and the bird nest kept under control by a head band. She smiled behind her dark sunglasses as a few boys by the Quidditch Supply shop took their eyes off some new broomstick in the window to check her out.
#+end_quote

The girl in question was twelve at that point in time. I guess one could argue that they were looking at her muggle getup but I got a whole other vibe from it. Maybe I'm just being overly paranoid and getting nitpicky, I'm not sure. I just think it's weird.


** I think a lot of authors get used to seeing the actors and reading post-school fics, and then forget that at this point in time the people they are describing are...children. Which I can /understand/, but it is creepy as hell when you stop and think about it.

** My personal view is that appearances should be left to the imagination. I honestly can only think of a few very specific cases where we need to know the color, fabric, and size of clothing that person wears.

I don't really get uncomfortable as much as recognizing the poor writing. If someone uses terms such as sexy or whatnot to describe the kid, then that is just a weird term to use. Beautiful, handsome, angelic, or any other word that emphasizes appearance is just fine with me. Trying to describe your character as beautiful isn't as effective as just saying they're beautiful. It let's the reader fill in the blanks.

*** ^ this is correct.

Unfortunately you get a ton of critics on Fanfiction that whine about not describing things enough. Which always irks me because it's way less effective for a variety of reasons.

One, the readers imagination is more likely to form a favorable picture of it than I am typing it out. So if I need the reader to like the character, I'd rather hint at things and let them fill in their preference than detail every inch of it. There's the whole beauty in the eye of the beholder thing. I'd rather let the reader fill in their own preferences. Of course I've only gotten I think four PMs asking me how busty characters are. So there's that.

Two, it makes plot points harder. If I'm specifically detailing clothing there's a purpose for it and I'm intentionally drawing the reader's attention to that. It should be a huge flag that it's something I want you to notice. IE Emily possessing the same wardrobe as Phoebe in LdS. If I describe clothing constantly that becomes pointless. If I don't, it's a huge context clue to a major plot point in the story.

**** In my opinion, the clothes, by themselves, are useless. It only becomes interesting if it brings something else to the discussion.

For example, I don't care in what fabric the jean of Harry is, what interest me is that said clothes are handed clothes from Dudley and are horrible on Harry.

Or I don't care that the wizard robe of Draco is in Acromantula silk with golden threads forming little motive on the sleeves, I care that he seemingly expensive wizard robe.

In the Harry Potter universe, a character wardrobe description should be reduced to :\\
- Muggle or Magical\\
- State of said wardrobe (hand me down, expensive, good quality but really out of fashion . . .)\\
- Maybe color, especially if the character is flashy like Lockart or Dumbledore

The only case where I would see a precise description would be in a romance where a shocked character notice every little detail of his loved one after a big change of appearance (first date and meeting out of uniform for exemple) and even there I think the description above is a bit much.

PS: As for grown up men turning around to look at a 12 years old girl, guess it's time to call the Aurors.

** They're probably wondering why a 12 year old is dressed like they've just stepped out of The Matrix.

But for me, when describing a person's appearance it should generally be limited to skin tone, hair and eye colour, and any immediately noticeable facial or body features (missing limbs, scars, even an especially large, bulbous nose would count). Just enough to get the reader's imagination to conjure up a rough image of the character in question. If you have to mention the clothes they're wearing, I would say to limit it to anything unusual, or immediately noticeable (Think Dumbledore's outlandish robes as an example).

** It's both a case of Dawson Casting, and because the authors are forced to ignore their age to have some romance/sex before than half of the canon plot pass and they can legally have sex.

They would be forced to wait until the 5th year before giving them a partner, so they use the suspension of disbelief to force it before.

Expecially within the "Lord and Ladies" storylines where the characters are aged politician at the ripe age of 12y.

*** I mean, it's always an option to just wait till 5th year to give them a partner. It just means you can't get bogged down in the minutia of years 1-3 and drag out the stations of canon to 300,000 words, which is actually a good thing for the quality of your writing anyway. In fact there's no law that says you even need to HAVE a first year, or that you can't just brush over the first couple years in a single chapter each, letting us know anything which didn't happen as it did in canon (we've all read the books).

** I would have said instinctively yes but I think it depends on context. In this example I read the character as 'cool' rather than 'sexy', and the passersby as being of a similar age to her, judging by how they are impressed by this.

I've seen examples I find more egregious and uncomfortable - usually when it starts verging into descriptions of body parts, or self-objectification done by the character, or observations made by the author when there are no characters around to be an observer, so the observations are how the author perceives the character, not how they are seen in-universe. But, at the same time, going too strongly the other way denies or hides the truth that younger kids do think about dating and are - even if they don't recognize those feelings as such yet - impressed by other kids they might have crushes on.

** It depends for me, we have an adult perspective, I assume. Most of the protagonists in HP are younger than me so I always find it weird when it gets sexy.

But something to remember is that a lot of authors are 14, 15, or 16 and to them its either a way to look mature or its from their perspective. I just have to remember that it might be a 14 year writing it who rightfully sees nothing wrong with explaining how how a 14 year old guy is. I just see it and move on.
