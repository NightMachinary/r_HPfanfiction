Hi hi!

I'm looking for fics that have Hermione friends with Slytherin students. Not necessarily as she's apart of Slytherin or she is a pureblood. But kind of like in the fic: The Twenty, where Pansy and Hermione became close friends like sisters in a way. I know that would go against MOST of what Slytherin stands for, but it was Dan interesting take on the story that I really enjoyed!

I also LOVE Snamione fics! I don't mind her being his student as long as she is legal and I kind of like my fics to be epic length but if the description and recommendation are well written, I'll read it :).

I don't mind smut or slow burn, not that big of a Drarry fan, and yeah!

Please leave any below! Thank you so much! <3

** You are going to LOVE this: linkao3(coven by naidhe) It's got Pansy and Hermione as the main characters becoming close, like sisters. It's a brilliant story about female friendships and falling into dark magic.

  “The problem here, professor Dumbledore, is that you keep wondering what my position on the board is. I started off as your pawn, then at some point I became a useful bishop; but suddenly you see yourself wondering if I might not just be the black queen.” Hermione looked at him then, and smiled softly, “And what you don't realize is that we're not playing chess anymore.”
