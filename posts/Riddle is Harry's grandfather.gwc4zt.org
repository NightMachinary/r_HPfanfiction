Does anyone know the name of the fic where Riddle finds out he his Harry's grandfather and him and Snape start working together to teach and protect Harry. I believe Tom learned of Snapes betrayal but since he did it to protect lily and letter swore to protect Harry he forgave him. I honestly can't remember any things. But I've always liked the idea that they were related and Harry has to come to terms with it.


** It's my own personal headcanon that Voldie is Harry's half-granduncle, like we know Voldie attended Hogwarts around the same time as the grandfather of Draco Malfoy did, so he's in the right time block as we know Lucius Malfoy was in Hogwarts during the Marauders Era.

Therefore, Tom Riddle(Voldie's father) married someone after Voldie was born, Had a child, who then grew up until Voldie's murder of her father and family, when she needed to fend for her own, and Lily's Father married her and she gave birth to Petunia and Lily, the latter of whom gave birth to Harry. Therefore making Voldie Harry's half-granduncle.
