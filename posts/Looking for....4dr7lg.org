I remember reading a story with Harry and Ginny. The premise was that Harry had a fantastic London apartment and a room to let for a very affordable price. Ginny moves in, not knowing him. To further confuse things, I believe that Ginny went by Natalie or Natasha. If I think of other salient plot points I'll edit this. Anyone know what I'm referring to?


** Sounds familiar, was Harry rather rich and just wanted some company? Also the twins or maybe Ron were upset that Ginny was moving in with a relative stranger? I'll check to see if I can find it.

Well, I can't. Sorry.
