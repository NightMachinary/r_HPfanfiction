** This would be really interesting. You don't see many stories where Harry grows up and he just wants to go back to the fighting. There are some people like that, and I can kinda see it happening to Harry.

** I've never watched Sherlock - do you mean misses like 'wasn't in the war' or misses like 'wants the war back'?

*** Maybe like the adrenaline rush? If you see Sherlock, you will understand. I am not good at explaining things

**** I'm more asking what you want. Like, are you looking for fics where Harry leaves, then isn't there to fight Voldemort, then comes back, or fics where a post-War Harry keeps wanting to fight and such?

***** I believe OP wants something like the second option.

John comes back from War and is shown to be unhappy with life, but as he is dragged into the high stake, mystery filled life of Sherlock we see him start to enjoy life, and start living again.
