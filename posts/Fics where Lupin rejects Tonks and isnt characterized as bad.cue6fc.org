So generally it seems that stories where he rejects her or their relationship falls apart hes usually potrayed as being dickish or just awful in my experience. So Im looking for fics where that isnt the case.

So a a Lupin centric fic where he rejects Tonks ( and they arent the endgame couple) either before they end up dating or after they start he breaks up with her, and he remains sympathetic. If they are in a relationship he breaks off I prefer it happens early in the fic.

They dont necessarily need to end up with others after the break up. If they do im fine with Slash het or Femslash its all good.

But no OC shipping and no Lupin Ã— anyone from Harrys generation. And no genderbending. Well i suppose Tonk's abilities always give her the ability to genderbend but apart from her no genderbending.

I love long fics preferably completed long fic. Something plot heavy or focusing on Lupin's character growth would work well.


** I really enjoyed linkffn(12794018).

EDIT: Whoops, I realized after the fact that my recommendation doesn't fit your ask, because you're looking for stories where they don't end up together in the end. The story I recommended is a canon-compliant telling of Remus and Tonks' love story, which means that Lupin spends a lot of time rejecting Tonks (and briefly running away from her while she's pregnant) but they ultimately end up together. It's from his POV, so it's obviously a Lupin-sympathetic story.

  Remus Lupin is a werewolf, and he's not intending to survive this war. Whatever Tonks says. She loves him, and he loves her, but werewolves cannot be trusted to fall in love. Can he survive his mission to the werewolf packs, and will he ultimately learn that even he deserves love?
