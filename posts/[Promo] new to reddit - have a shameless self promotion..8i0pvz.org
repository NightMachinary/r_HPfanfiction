** Well, I've just finished reading the first chapter and I've enjoyed it so far. It's an intriguing opening, though you do have a couple of formatting issues and punctuation errors. You used a full-stop instead of a comma with the dialogue tag, for example:

i.e., "Yes." said Verity.

It really should be a comma instead. If the dialogue tag is 'said', 'screamed', 'whispered', 'yelled' or anything along those lines, it should be a comma being used: "Yes," said Verity.

On the other hand:

#+begin_quote
  /"Well, Harry Potter, I believe you too will do great things." At that, the man offered him a strained smile and turned away./
#+end_quote

That's correct, because the action of Ollivander offering a strained smile and turning away is not related to him speaking.

The line before Ollivander's line, you also missed a comma:

#+begin_quote
  /"Harry Potter" he murmured.../
#+end_quote

So yeah, it's mainly little nit-picky stuff like that. If you already knew everything I just told you, then it's basically just proofread.

Also, you switched from Voldemort to Tom at one point. I'm wondering if you're making a distinction between them or if you're using their names interchangeably? It was a bit jarring though.

Unrelated to your technical writing, I feel like I should warn you that the Voldemort/Harry pairing isn't very popular on this subreddit (though I do ship them, sort of), and in general, requests for slash fics tend to get downvoted. It's a bit of a pity; I think a lot of people on the subreddit think that slash fics don't paint an accurate representation of gay relationships, which is, I suppose, true of many. Not saying anything about yours, because well, I've only read the first chapter.

*** Hey. Yeah, thankfully the comma in speech thing was pointed out to me via a reviewer a couple of years ago. My grammar is a lot better now than when I started writing it. I went through a rough re-edit last year but I probably didn't catch all the mistakes.

As for slash fic - a lot of it is bad, but there's some of it I enjoy. I think I'm going to branch out in fem-slash soon since there seems to be so little of it.

  AU. In a world where Sybil Trelawney is never born, the prophecy remains, but goes unheard. How different will Harry Potter's life be growing up in a world where Voldemort won? How long until a brilliant young man is noticed by the ever more brilliant Dark Lord?
