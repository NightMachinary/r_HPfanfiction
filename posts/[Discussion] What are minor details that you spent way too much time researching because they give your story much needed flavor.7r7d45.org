** British geography. Like in this story, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12631584/1/Driving-Miss-Weasley][Driving Miss Weasley]] I spent ages looking at the Scottish road network, villages, mountains, lochs, military bases and possible locations for Hogwarts and the surrounding nature. The fun thing is that you learn tons of stuff along the way. One scene for the story I'm writing now, for example, takes place in [[https://www.google.nl/maps/place/Jaywick,+Clacton-on-Sea,+Verenigd+Koninkrijk/@51.7813634,1.0961934,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47d9130cde094af1:0xbb1909647ad3aa31!8m2!3d51.779403!4d1.117437][Jaywick]]. Do yourself a favour and roam around there with Street View. I didn't know such poverty existed in Western Europe. It was a real eye opener.

*** Similar: I have my character taking the tube from a London suburb to central London.

I spent ages researching ticket prices (would they be able to afford it), to how the tube map looked like then and how they'd gotten there (the London Overground didn't exist yet, and neither did TfL).

I'm not from England. When I visited London a few months later, I was surprisingly familiar with the network.

--------------

For an abandoned story I once wanted to pin down a date where Sirius escaped from Azkaban. So I researched possible locations, and ended up with "close to Sunderland" and then looked at possible dates for when Sirius could have escaped, looked at historical weather data of which days would have even been warm (not many), and even mapped a route through the town and how and where from he steals clothes.

I even found out which buildings of the local university were new, and how it would have looked like back then.

You can go into amazing detail if you want.

*** I just looked around jaywick... what the hell are you on about? That's not poverty. Are we looking at the same place? I'm seeing a residential neighborhood. It doesn't look fancy, but there are some decent houses in the area. There are much poorer places in western europe.

Add to that the fact that it's [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaywick][one if the most deprived places in the UK]]. I'd say the Banlieues in France are comparable in terms of ghettofactor, but that's about it.

***** *Jaywick*

Jaywick is a seaside village in the Tendring district of Essex, England, 2 miles (3 km) west of Clacton-on-Sea. It lies on the North Sea coast of England, 60 miles (97 km) from London and 17 miles (27 km) from Colchester. It was constructed in the 1930s as a holiday resort for Londoners, but over time has become one of the most deprived areas in the country.

The land was originally a combination of fields and salt marshes, and was generally unsuitable for agricultural use.

**** It isn't a normal neighborhood, it was originally constructed in the 1930 as a seaside holiday resort. Poverty increased in the country and it became used as a normal residential area, even though the houses and infrastructure weren't built for that. It's also built on salt marshes, so the soil is completely useless for anything but grass. If you check the wiki link I posted in reply to another comment, you'll read that it's one of the most deprived places in the UK. This is not at all a totally normal neighborhood.

** - I've spent at least four hours researching Dover, Kent in order to find a good location for a manor

- Went through the books twice to get all the quotes on the characters that lived in the period from 1920s until 1981; after that were JK's interviews, Pottermore, and reliable information from the HP Wiki.

- Made a family tree of every canon family during that time

- Shouldn't probably even start on etymology; I have a file named /Celtic Baby Names/ with over 8k words, and I think I've used only two or three of them

**** Caradoc Dearborn is Welsh, and totally deserves a spot in a ff. An original member of the Order of the Phoenix, he was alive in July 1981 for the photo, but later "disappeared and his body was never found." He has a beard, and as such his age is really fungible. Sounds like the set up for time travel shenanigans to me!

Which stores where in which direction, what was in Knockturn Alley, what they sold in certain stores, and I looked up what flavors of ice cream they serve at Florean Fortescue's! I even found a virtual tour of Diagon Alley someplace that I spend hours on, figuring out what path I wanted my characters to take and what stops they should make and where they should have their first kiss.

** I spend way too much time understanding the concepts of war and how I think wizards would play. most of it I use in my Potter Grimoire series, but there are moments when I don't use any of it

I also end up doing alot of world building via dialogue. So I have to figure out if this is convenient here or not. For example I made a tidbit about a portkey incident in 1678, which fits the world I created rather well.

Another thing I researched alot was the Krakatoa eruption. For reasons explained in the story.

** In my biggest most in depth story EVER, Fight For Rights, I've been using google Earth constantly and street views to get intimate and realistic knowledge of foreign locations, since my main character globe hops the entire story with her companions! :) I love it so much, for example, that I can go into new york and see a street or a beach, and have my characters in my story GO DOWN THAT STREET and describe it in the story accurate to real life! :) It's amazing and helps me to really write these places I have never been, but that my characters are at! :) I also look at pictures of places like Scottish Highlands, or the Black Desert, if Google Earth doesn't have proper images or street views of them. :)

Also since the story is about a sentient rights movement and activism, I've been doing research on REAL movements, like the civil rights and women's rights movements, to see how long they lasted, what sort of things they did, like protests and stuff, and then using that for my fictional movement! :)
