:END:
Searching for a specific fic with heavy worldbuilding. I recall it had a heavy focus on Black family members who were older than Lucius Malfoy, the fic starts out pre-Voldemort's rise, before the Mauraders were at Hogwars or maybe before they were even born, perhaps even pre-Grindwald. There was actual focus on wizarding culture.

Some details I recall included children not really being out and about much until they were old enough to have proper manners and were mature enough to avoid bringing shame to the family. It was A Thing to be properly introduced to society in a sort of annual debut gathering once you were mature enough, and there was a bit of a range age wise in when you could be introduced. Lucius was apparently introduced at the oldest he could have been without scandal, and still had manners barely polite enough to avoid bringing shame to his family.

At one point, a female Black was getting ready to go to Diagon Alley, I think, and I recall it mentioning her robe being double layered, a snug inner layer that wouldn't ruck up or move in ways that would flash skin, a loose over layer for modesty, and a weighted hem to keep it from flying up. I want to say the initial main characters were a male Black and two same generation female Blacks, but I could be wrong about that.

The debut balls fell out of use during one of the wizarding wars, when before they had been aggressively neutral events where even the worst enemies wouldn't be so crass as to cause a scene. There was also some dismay over the swapping of muggle versions of holidays and such like Christmas for Yule, and the general fading of magical traditions and the loss of awareness for the actual legit reasons for some of them.

Does this ring a bell for anyone? Can anyone help me find this fic?
