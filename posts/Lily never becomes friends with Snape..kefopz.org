For whatever reason you want, Lily doesn't meet Snape before Hogwarts and neither do they become friends throughout their school years. What effects does this have?


** It would probably make Wizarding Britain much worse off. Say what you want about Snape, but he did play a part in the sequence of events that would ultimately lead to Voldemort's death. Without anyone at all showing any sort of compassion for him, he'd likely become a Death Eater like in canon, but this time /without/ having a "weakness". And thus there would be no BWL.

Ironically, I always figured that Snape needed to walk pretty much the exact line he did in canon, or things would be worse off. Make him nicer and never a Death Eater, and the Potters (or perhaps the Snapes now, whatever floats your boat) would never have a Boy who Lived. Make him darker, and nothing causes him to turn, causing all 3 of the Potters to die.

Depends. Ok without Snape begging for her life, Voldemort would never have given Lily a /choice./ But I can still see her getting in between Harry and Voldemort. I can still see her saying "no, not Harry, take me" even if Voldemort hasn't done the "stand aside" bit. She'd have still known about the prophecy, and would know it was Harry he really wanted, and would still have attempted to protect and sacrifice herself for Harry.

That kind of magic seems to be about intent, and Lily's intent would always, always, be to sacrifice herself so that her son might live. The only way I can see her not doing this is if Voldemort just blasts her down dead without a word. But I still reckon she'd be in front of the crib, ready to put up some sort of fight, which could still activate the protection. All Snape's interference and the choice given by Voldemort does is make her intent so clear it can't be misread, but she could still act with the same intent regardless of what Voldemort says to her.

**** The reason I don't think that would work is that I very much doubt Lily was the only one to die for their child. It just doesn't make any sense. However, Lily was the only one Voldemort was willing to "save", due to Snape's request.

***** No I agree that obviously other parents have died for their child. But how often was that child /the specific target/? I actually think it's a combination in canon of both her being given the choice but also that Harry was specifically the one he was after. Other families killed by Voldemort or Death Eaters weren't targeted specifically because of their 15 month old kid the way the Potters were - they were either in the wrong place at the wrong time or it was the /adults/ Voldemort wanted and the kids were collateral damage.

Because it's the other way round with the Potters - he wants the /child/ and the adults are collateral damage, I think there's enough to work on there that a fic with no Snape (he doesn't work at Hogwarts if he doesn't love Lily) could still have a BWL. Because there's still an opportunity for Lily to stand between her child and someone who /actively wants him dead./

Oh definitely, it's not like your viewpoint violates canon or anything. Just saying how I personally view the events and what the likely outcomes would be.

******* I think you're probably right that in a world with no Snape and Lily, there's most likely no BWL. But I do think there's a slight chance there could be, especially as the Potters knew he wanted Harry so she makes a conscious decision to sacrifice herself.

It would be an interesting concept, as how would Harry's life be without Snape? Would someone else have bothered to do a counter curse on his broom? Who would have fed false information to the Death Eaters about him being moved? Who would have given Dung the idea for the Seven Potters (I seem to recall for some reasons that it comes out that Snape under polyjuice gets him drunk and suggests it)? Who would have told him he was a horcrux? Dumbledore would have died before the events of HBP. Harry would never know about Horcruxes full stop.

Would Sirius have died - without Snape around to constantly get at him about being locked up, would he have been so brash and desparate to prove himself that he charged into the DoM without looking?

Gah. Snape is so bloody necessary to the storyline, you sort of wish he'd be half nice once in a while.

Pretty much the only case where I prefer the movie character over the book one in fics. I don't care for Alan Rickman per se (good actor, but I care nothing for him beyond that), but movie!Snape's character is /far/ more palatable to deal with without making me want to punch him in the face.

While, I personally don't mind a good Snape redemption story (Crime and Punishment is a decent example), most people don't really do it well. And at that point, I'd prefer to simply just deal with the movie version of him.

** Would the rivalry with him and the Marauders be the same? A huge part of the Snape-James rivalry at least is based on jealousy over Lily. If Lily is nothing to Snape, does he have a reason to hate them (any more so than a Slytherin hated a Gryffindor at that point)? Would that initial conversation on the train where the enmity was established have even taken place? If Lily was not on Snape's radar, would he have taken such an interest in Gryffindors the way he did? Would he have been so obsessed with finding out about Remus?

If none of that happens, The Bad Prank doesn't happen. If The Bad Prank doesn't happen, are people less likely to think Sirius is going dark? I imagine even without Snape, the Potters would have been put under the fidelius - Dumbledore would have realised eventually that they fit - but if The Bad Prank hadn't happened, would there have been less mistrust between Sirius and Remus, thus enabling the truth about the secret keeper to come out faster and Harry ends up raised by, or at least in contact with, people who actually care for him?

*** I don't think anyone but Snape really thought much about that particular prank later on.

Sirius got the blame because everyone knew he was the secret keeper (I suspect they did something like have Peter write the secret down and then Sirius deliver it, claiming he doesn't want to say it aloud for fear of being overheard, perhaps they chose not to share it much at all) and therefore the only one who could have betrayed them.

Combine that with Peter's theatrics of accusing him and faking his own very public murder and there would be no doubt.

Remember that noone suspected Peter or Sirius beforehand.

** A long time ago, before the reveal that they were friends, or even Snape's half blood status, there were already fics about the rivalry between James and Snape. It was assumed that Snape was a pureblood because it seemed like all Slytherins were purebloods at that time. That was why he joined Voldemort.

Unfortunately, I can't remember any particular fic that stands out but you can find some of them on this old website: [[http://www.sugarquill.net/index.php?action=search_go&keywords=Snape&criteria=3&search=Go]]

I'm trying to read some of them now and the results have been interesting.

Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that even without the knowledge about Snape's friendship with Lily, authors before have already thought of ways for Snape and James Potter to hate each other, for Snape to join Voldemort and for him to betray the Dark Lord and become a spy. So I think he would still do all of the stuff he did in the books due to some reason as equally compelling as his friendship with Lily and this change would cause him not to have a doe patronus, no memories of Lily to share and no conflict about Dumbledore's plan to send Harry to his death.

** I read a theory where Harry lives because Voldemort unwittingly made an unbreakable vow. Voldemort promises Snape he will spare Lily if she surrenders. He then tells lily to step aside. She says kill her instead of her son, Voldemort agrees by killing her, which creates the vow. Trying to kill Harry then makes the vow blast his life away, but the horcruxes keep him as a wraith.

If Snape wasn't friends with Lily he probably would feel conflicted about joining Voldemort as I expect he was in canon. Maybe he would have joined sooner? Maybe he would be more determined to climb the ranks amongst death eaters? Maybe he wouldn't be at Hogshead to hear the prophecy?

** Snape still clashes with the Marauders/joins the Death Eaters, probably being even more vicious towards muggleborns. Without a last-minute freakout over "Oh no I just sent Voldemort after Lily" he doesn't defect. Karkaroff still squeals and without Dumbledore's protection gets Snape sent to Azkaban with Crouch Jr and various other Inner Circle members, assuming he doesn't just get the Dementor's Kiss for his involvement in the attack on the Potters.

Oh and there's no reason to think Voldemort would even lose, there's be no hiding behind a fidelius and no attempt at sparing Lily.

Peter would also never be revealed and Sirius never framed as a result of that.

No. The only known case of Azkaban escapees were Sirius, Barty Jr, death eaters in OOTP and when Sirius escapes everyone says no one else has escaped from Azkaban so there has to be some other people who got kissed
