In cannon legamincy and occlumency are very unused and also spells I hoped for more of a variety Also should what year should Harry learn to block spells since I think 6 or 5 years a little late


** Fake Moody was teaching spell deflection in 4th year, separate from the use of the Shield charm. Occlumency and Legilimency may have been a bit more prevalent than you might think. We know that Dumbledore, Snape, Voldemort, and Bellatrix were skilled in it, but then Draco was taught the basics of it over the summer by Bellatrix, and it's not like she's a trusted figure in his life, or known for her tutoring skills. Horace Slughorn wasn't a strong personality but he was skilled enough with the mind arts to defend his mind against Dumbledore and to modify an memory for extraction.

** Give powers you think are cool, just as long as you give them a justification, it doesn't have to be good, just a reason.

Keep it loose to you don't write yourself into a corner and remember the rules of making a proper DnD spell: it should do something useful, cool and theme appropriate.

​

As for power creep a few easy options

-Follow the shonen example and set up a strong enemy to loom over the protag, slowly building up to a tough fight.

Harry beats Draco, Draco loses to Snape, Harry must prove he can beat Snape before he goes after Voldemort.

​

-Follow the Sat morning cartoon example and have a bunch of enemies in flux with the heroes. All the powerlevels don't matter as much and it's where personalities, abilities and type matchups really matter.

Harry can beat Voldemort most times, but not Draco all the time, but never Snape.

****** Just don't do the shitty "oh, let's train Harry and fuck his friends" - make the teacher train at least the trio. Harry, Ron and Hermione together can defeat much more difficult enemies than Harry by himself.

** u/Hellstrike:
#+begin_quote
  In cannon legamincy and occlumency are very unused
#+end_quote

That is because they are obscure magic, not something most people know about. Mostly because they are not useful in everyday life and most people will live their whole lives without ever using them or be the victim of it.

#+begin_quote
  Also should what year should Harry learn to block spells since I think 6 or 5 years a little late
#+end_quote

The duelling club was supposed to include blocking spells IIRC, and that was in year 2. And you can always introduce them in year 4 and blame it on tournament preparations.
