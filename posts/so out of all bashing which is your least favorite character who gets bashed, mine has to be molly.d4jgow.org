** Hard choice between Harry, James, Lily, and Sirius.

The first one is bashed subtly. It's usually a Hermione/Harmony or OC sister story. It's just unnecessary, especially in the case of the former. Harry does not have to be included in your Hermione centric fic. And it's very easy to tell when you wanted to write a Hermione story, but made it Harry centric anyway.

The other three are all bashed in the name of Snape: innocent victim, reformed Death Eater, and/or Lord of Prince Manor, who somehow in these stories is above being petty, vicious, and antagonistic despite the opposite being canon. I have no issue with James and Sirius being assholes towards Snape. The issue is that there's no return.

Poor Lily was called a slur and somehow that's her fault and, because Snape was her friend, she owed him an apology for the rest of her life choices.

She victim-blamed Sirius for being unlawfully incarcerated in the worst place on earth for a decade.

She was outstandingly rude to her future daughter-in-law and tried to break their engagement up.

She told Harry that his stay at the Dursleys had her worried so much that she was about to get him out of there and then never does anything to actually help him. And before you claim Blood protection, the Tonks home repels the entirety of Voldemort's forces without the need for child abuse.

She also joked about making a love potion. You remember how Ron reacted to a "harmless" one sold over the counter, right? Those things are not just "a little fun", they are rape drugs. I mean, you can cook meth just for the fun, but let's be real, most people who do have other motivations.

On the other hand we have Fenrir, someone that doesn't get all that much screen time yet is implied to be very powerful dispite the fact that he suffers from lycanthropy (we also know that he "embraces it" and seeks to turn other people).

Of course, Fenrir is a psychopath (or whatever the correct term is) but we can speculate that there is more to lycathropy than what Remus says (or even knows). And since this is fanfiction, we can slightly alter the affliction aswell.

His relationship with Tonks in the books was written like ass. Off-screen development, shitty communication issues, and seemed like it was based off guilt and loneliness rather than actual, genuine love.

Idk, it never felt like a healthy relationship when Tonks lost her magic and stopped morphing because a man rejected her advances, and Lupin actually thought running off with Harry and his pals and leaving the pregnant woman he legally /chose to marry/ behind was the best solution for all their problems.

***** For the sake of discussion but while I agree that it was "written like ass" in that the reader doesn't really see many good sides to their relationship, rather just a string of issues then they're married and have a kid or whatever, but couldn't this be more of just a 'the story is told from Harry's POV' thing?

I mean he wasn't available to see large swaths of time where Remus and Tonks were off doing other things while he was at Hogwarts/Horcrux hunting. Who's to say they didn't have a fine relationship during that time?

As for some of the other bits, A) No relationship is perfect B) They both likely have chips on their shoulder/baggage as a result of being discriminated against for being a Werewolf, or just for being different in Tonks' case. In which case particularly with a war as it were going on emotions would be charged pretty high and people can do weird/dramatic things.

Maybe it's all my own opinions, but while I wouldn't say Remus and Tonks were some stellar worlds most alpha couple, they were a fine if not unusual couple that were largely inconsequential because frankly they weren't around much.

** Ginny when she's presented as a goldding slut, especially while she's still at Hogwarts. I don't care for her all that much and don't mind if she's presented in a negative light, but slutshaming a character who is little more than a kid is gross.

Also Hermione. A good Dumbledore bash, for example, can be very entertaining; bashfic!Hermione is simply pointlessly annoying in addition to being nothing like her canon self.

**** Hermione's flaws are her self-righteousness and end-justifies-means attitude, and you can spin it as a basis for her as an interesting antagonist. But in bashfics, she's always there to just nag Harry about the rules and blidly trust the authority in general and Dumbledore in particular. And the main problem with that for me is not even that it doesn't make sense (even though it doesn't). When Dumbledore is bashed, at least he becomes an obstacle for Harry to overcome. Even Ron bashing often serves the plot, however stupid this plot might be. When Hermione is bashed, she is just there, like an annoying fly, appearing occasionally to lecture Harry on his life choices.

When the entire school believed he was the Heir of Slytherin, Ron stood by his side.

When a crazed mass murderer (from their perspective) was going to kill Harry, Ron put himself between them.

When Harry traveled across the country to break into the Ministry to confront some of the most dangerous wizards in Britain in a desperate rescue attempt, Ron fought by his side.

And when Harry needed to become a fugitive to hunt down artifacts specially protected by the most dangerous wizard in Britain, Ron was willing to leave his family (who were in danger themselves) behind to help him.

But perhaps most importantly, Ron welcomed him into his family. Ron, the youngest son who feels constantly overshadowed and outshined, welcomed The Boy Who Lived into his family because Harry didn't have one.

Ron's not perfect. He is prideful, jealous, and hotheaded. But he's also never hesitated to put his life on the line for Harry, and was never upset about Harry becoming a Weasley in all but name- in fact, he encouraged it. Nobody and no friendship is perfect- but you couldn't ask for a better friend than Ron Weasley.

*** Yeah, Ron's complicated. He makes some huge fuck-ups in regards to his relationship with Harry, but in the end he always comes back. With writing it's easy enough to use those as breaking points in their relationship, thinking that Harry shouldn't have been so quick to forgive him, and thinking Ron should have done more. But it's understandable why Harry was quick to forgive, he doesn't have a lot of close friends and in both GoF and DH he needed all the support he could get.

Another issue is the Ron is lazy (not as lazy as in fanon, and definitely not as stupid), and this leads a lot of people to assume he's holding Harry back (eg. Harry taking Divination with Ron because it's an easy class), and that if Harry were to improve his studies Ron needs to go.

He's a flawed character, and I definitely think his canon portrayl could have been a lot better, but he doesn't deserve the bashing he gets in fanfic. But there are reasons for it.

*** I'd say that part of the problem with Ron (or more to the point, what people might have a problem with him) is that in the first half of the books (1-4) he has a big fight with Hermione and then Harry in back to back books.

With the sharp tonal shift in books after 4, I know that I kind of jump to thinking about 1-4 as the more 'typical' Harry Potter in my mind. If other are that same way, then Ron stands out of the 3 as the one most likely to get angry over something either unreasonable (Hermione turning in Harry's broom) or just jealousy (the Triwizard tournament)...

Part of it too is that those examples stick out because they do hurt Harry a lot.

In the end, 'actual' bashing of him is something that does put me off of fics. But I don't mind one where his positive qualities are a bit more brushed over, or Neville replaces him in the main trio. You don't have to have him completely greedy/gold digging/irredeemable to make that fit IMO.

He hated Harry for being the reason Lily died and for being a constant reminder that lily chose James, but did his best to keep him alive anyway cause he's the last living part of Lily. FanFic writers tend to either scale him too far into mustache-twirling levels of evil or make him secretly a nice guy all along but he had to hide it would “blow his triple agent” cover or whatever.

  "If Dad hadn't said anything, old Rita would just have said it was disgraceful that nobody from the Ministry had commented,' said Bill, who was playing chess with Ron. ‘Rita Skeeter never makes anyone look good. Remember, she interviewed all the Gringotts curse breakers once, and called me “a long-haired pillock”?"

...a few weeks later...

  Hedwig didn't return until the end of the Easter holidays. Percy's letter was enclosed in a package of Easter eggs that Mrs Weasley had sent. Both Harry's and Ron's were the size of dragon eggs, and full of home-made toffee. Hermione's, however, was smaller than a chicken's egg. Her face fell when she saw it.

  "Your mum doesn't read Witch Weekly, by any chance, does she, Ron?" she asked quietly.

  Hermione looked sadly at her tiny egg.

  "So then I tried to borrow Hermes---"

  "Who?"

  "The owl Mum and Dad bought Percy when he was made a prefect," said Fred from the front.

  "But Percy wouldn't lend him to me," said Ron.

Lmao, Percy the Prefect was given a brand new owl that he refused to share with the family, even when their family owl, Errol, was dying. That same year, First Year Ron gets sent to school with a second-hand wand.

****** The fact that this is the best example of what you could come up with from canon to actually criticize her actually makes OP's point. I don't think she is a saint (no-one is) but she is an exceedingly good person.

***** Welcome! I've been reading Harry Potter fan-fiction for over 15 years and I still find hidden gems and new stories - despite reading 10's of millions of words of HP Fanfiction. There is some absolutely amazing stuff out there, you're going to have a ball.

I hope you get half as much entertainment as I have!

** If bashed badly? Probably most anyone. Heavy handed bashing is just extremely off putting - putting them in a dumb, mustache twirling villain approach.

Now, in some fics I guess that can work. But in general? I'd much prefer to have it be done more... competently? Like, instead of say Weasley bashing (invariably done horribly), just don't really include them. It's far more believable than having them all turn out to be horrible people not worth saving.

Even making characters completely evil can be done without any actual bashing, IMO.

** While I never approve of bashing, the one I usually find the most offputting is Harry-bashing. Not really sure why, but it always felt really wrong and offputting to me.

I read a lot of SS-centric fic. Whenever romance is involved, you can almost always expect there to be Ron or James-bashing (depending on whoever he's paired with). While I dislike it, I've read enough to it to be desensitized by it, unfortunately. But Harry-bashing is so rare that when it does come up, it throws me off enough that it can lead to me stopping to read fics, which I usually never do.

The only person that comes to mind that I've seen bashed less is Lily, and it's so rare (I've only seen it twice after everything I've seen) that I have a habit of treating a fic as crack if it comes up, and thus stop taking the fic seriously.

** (Mo-)Ron, (MO-)RON! :D

or:

Canon-Harry (truly a dumbass IMHO...do stupid to take a dump! I mean who would play chess and quidditch and laze around while a well armed (a dark lord is like the RL version of a well armed and trained assassin!) guy wants him dead...seriously, this message of "It's ok to be lazy, if you are willing to take a bullet/curse for your friends" is the worst part of Harry Potter! Sorry Rowling, Harry should either have beaten Voldemort directly or he should have died (noble sacrifice!) for his stupidity!)
