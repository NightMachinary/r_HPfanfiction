Hello Everyone!

​

I'm FanfictionLister and as my name implies I make and post lists of fanfiction. The fanfiction are of those that I personally have read and liked and wanted to share with everyone.

​

This isn't my first list overall but it is my first posting of a Harry Potter FF list. So far I only have anime fanfiction lists but I'll one day work on other things as well like LotR, etc. So if any of you like anime such as Naruto, One Piece and Katekyou Hitman Reborn, I have lists out for those already. However if you are mainly for books and TV Shows/Movie... I'm afraid you'll have to wait a while :(

​

(I get into these moods where i'm stuck on a certain fandom for a while and don't read much else. That's why there is so few options of fandoms so far. However I'm sure that'll change one day when I finally drag myself to the other fandoms for those fanfics to be read! :D)

​

Anyways, that's all I wanted to share!

Onto the list!

​

(P.S. If you have you're own recommendations please leave them in the comments below with a link, title and summary.)

*A Trebled Soul*

by sprx77

Summary: Harry Potter knew he was different long before he knew he was a wizard.

The fear ebbed away and was replaced by something else as he took in the sight of the setting sun on the far-off horizon, warm-hued colors painting the buildings until they resembled a different city, the village of his dreams. Being up high was of no concern just then, as the wind picked up and it felt like coming home.

Or:

“Do you think I'd look good with pink hair?”

Dudley pauses, thinks on it.

“Like your friend Sakura?”

“Exactly like my friend Sakura.”

*The Smurg*

by Jessiy

Summary: After refusing to accept devastating losses in the war against Voldemort, Hermione goes back in time to change it all. A different sort of time travel - Hermione/Grindelwald

​

*Help Wanted*

by ArabellaFaith

Summary: Hermione is divorced, broke, and keeping a secret from the world. A Help Wanted ad seems like it could be the solution to all her problems. Can she finally put her past behind her and have a chance at a real future?

*The Death Mist*

by excentrykemuse

Summary: Everyone told him he was Harry Potter. He knew better. He was Lycoris Rosier Black. He just didn't know what that meant.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15857760?view_full_work=true]]

​

*Of Kings, Of Pawns, and Of Men*

by madstoryteller999

Summary: "I wonder what it means," Harry rasped, straightening as he wiped the blood from his mouth, "that your first instinct was to hit me. Do you think that came from the muggles too?"---he paused, head tilting, gaze riveted on the figure in front of him---"Do you punish all your death eaters like that or am I just...special?"

******

After the dementor attack, Harry wakes to find that his soul/consciousness is now in Tom Riddle's body. And the Dark Lord? He's doing an unfortunately good job of impersonating the Boy-Who-Lived. Dumbledore's disappeared, and Voldemort doesn't hesitate to let Harry know that he makes a weak replacement for the leader of his opposition.

So---Harry really has no choice but to prove him wrong.

​

*Paradoxical Parallels*

by History_On_Repeat

Summary: Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, suffered a remarkably similar past to the child Tom Riddle when he was put into the foster care system as an infant. He grew up equally charismatic, just as cunning, and with the same love for the chaotic.

But, with no amorentia flowing through his veins, Harry did not share the same struggles to understand or to feign human emotions.

Perhaps it was because of this, Dumbledore would muse many years into the future, that he had never suspected Harry as he had done with young Tom. At least, not until it was far too late.

Harry's chosen allegiances were ones that they would never see coming.

​

*Straightaway Dangerous*

by zeitgeistic (faire_weather)

Summary:

During the final battle, an unexpected insult sends Fenrir Greyback on a rampage, changing 39 people into werewolves. He should've known better than to make Hermione one of that number.

Includes werewolf living and culture, Draco's questionable morals, Hermione's questionable life choices, and unrequited bromance (well, it's requited a bit, but don't tell Potter that).

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1055377?view_full_work=true#main]]

​

*The Snake Who Changed My Life*

by aereandria

Summary: Harry meets a fun-loving magical snake whilst at the zoo for Dudley's 7th birthday which changes his outlook on his life and the people in it.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16556138?view_full_work=true]]

​

*Soul Scars*

by ShayaLonnie

Summary: "Scars can come in handy." --- Magic gives the gift of a soulmate. Separated by war, alliances, beliefs, and blood, but connected by skin. What if you shared the scars of the person that magic has given you? What if you really, really wished that you didn't?

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12035442?view_full_work=true#main]]

​

*Invisus*

by kdblaylock93

Summary: The only time that Harri Potter had called Aunt Petunia ‘mum', she was promptly smacked across the face.

It wasn't the first time that her Aunt had hit her, but it was certainly the hardest. “I'm not your mother,” Aunt Petunia had snarled at her.

__________________________________________________________________________________________

It was only later, in the privacy of the room she had rented at the Leaky Cauldron, that Harri was finally alone. She removed the ribbon Mr. Ollivander had wrapped around her wrist to see the words that should have appeared once her wand bonded.

The words 'Avada Kedavra' glared at her in emerald green.

Harri's heart dropped.

​

*Carry On My Wayward Son*

by BlackDawnRose

Summary: When Harry's world is turned upside down he makes a decision that will alter his life forever. However things may not turn out the way he expects

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3868408?view_full_work=true]]

​

*No Competition*

by AnyaMcL

Summary: What if the Horcrux hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned? Rather than influencing Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. An aura already rather grey, despite his innocent nature. Grey with the darkness of his parents traumatic deaths, grey with his status as the last living primary heir of the Peverells, thusly a child of Death -- and that made him something warm, endearing and adorable to the dark creatures of the magical world.

Man, wouldn't that suck for any other wannabe dark lord trying to make a comeback!

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3579981?hide_banner=true&view_full_work=true#main]]

​

*Marks of the Master*

by Zenithyl

Summary: ...Don't necessarily make the master. If anything, it's the other way around.

“The Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone, the Cloak of Invisibility.

Together, they make the Deathly Hallows.

Together, they make one Master of Death.”

Except, Beatle the Bard was not quite right---and neither was Xenophilius Lovegood.

Now Harry must find his own path as the Master of Death, all the while dancing a one-man tap dance between Death above and Death below. What's worse, unmaking and remaking the Hallows is only the first step.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4198062?view_full_work=true]]

​

*Convergence*

by itskathybabe

Summary: Magic is like an entity. It resides within us like a cancer, growing and developing into an all-consuming fire in our souls, a beautiful infection that shapes us into who we are and who we're meant to be. If you're lucky enough... you can see it.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1301185?view_full_work=true#main]]

​

*The Spellmaker*

by SonnyGietzel

Summary: Latin; a dead language with no practical applications except perhaps the deciphering of old texts and as a particularly quaint party trick.

Thankfully, as Harry finds out, Latin is not as dead as he was first taught when he decided to learn the language. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, of course; he loved Latin, and would have been proud to know it even had it been as useless as it was pretty. But in the world of Wizards, the world of Magic, Harry realizes his rare talent with words is particularly valuable in the highly complicated and controversial subject of Spell Creation, a subject he soon becomes enamored with despite having to hide his interest from everyone.

Besides, it's not like he's going Dark, after all.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/689909?view_full_work=true]]

​

*To the Waters and the Wild*

by Paimpont

Summary: Flying back from Godric's Hollow, Hagrid accidentally drops baby Harry over a wild forest. Harry is raised by rebel fairies until his Hogwarts letter arrives. The Dark Lord is in for a surprise... HP/LV romance.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/610384?view_full_work=true#main]]

​

*Harry Potter and the Legacy of Magic*

by History_On_Repeat

Summary: At the age of four, Harry Potter was left on the steps of an orphanage by the Dursleys. He would grow up experiencing the cruelty of children and learning that only the powerful will survive.

At the same time, he hears, by chance, mentions a figure worthy of his respect: Tom Marvolo Riddle. Despite the frustratingly lacking information on the elusive ‘mudblood'-turned-‘King of Slytherin' from decades in the past, Harry is determined to follow in the steps of his role model.

Disgusted with the restrictions the Ministry have placed on magical Britain, Harry vows to bring about change and leave his own legacy of magic. But for now, he will earn his rightful place in Hogwarts, even if he has to take the school by storm.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15688830?view_full_work=true#main]]

​

*Memory of Stars*

by Ownlildreamworld (morg)

Summary: Somewhere during the horcrux hunt things take a significant turn and the end of the war plays out quite differently. Secrets have been uncovered and one year has stretched into more than two. Harry is tired and decides on one last risky gambit before he calls it quits for good.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6782269?view_full_work=true#main]]

​

*A Sirius Plan*

by Lorixjake

Summary: Sirius has a very different reaction to hearing his godson has been attacked by Dementors. Taking matters into his own hands, Sirius struggles to navigate being a good godparent to Harry and trying to fight the war on a whole new front.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14424912?view_full_work=true]]

​

*When Darkness Comes*

by sifshadowheart

Summary: Harry Potter was a contrary creature. He'd learned young that anything Vernon Dursley said the opposite was likely to be true. So when he turned his teacher's hair blue - magic according to his classmates - and Vernon decried that "There Was No Such Thing As MAGIC" Harry knew that magic was real - more that magic was what he had. A Grey Harry story.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14381067?view_full_work=true]]

​

*Parselbrat*

by Ziel

Summary: Harry discovers Parseltongue a little earlier. As magic goes, it's not very useful. It's enough to make a few friends though. And isn't that enough?

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10687323?view_full_work=true]]

​

*There are More Things in Heaven and Earth...*

by Maevi

Summary: Hera; Uncertain meaning, possibly from either Greek ‘ηρως (heros) "hero, warrior"; ‘ωρα (hora) "period of time"; or ‘αιρεω (haireo) "to be chosen".

Hera Potter was tired of only surviving. She wanted to live. So she took the chance when it presented itself.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10297919?view_full_work=true#main]]

​

*Rage*

by puppy_on_crack

Summary: Harry has had a shit life. His parents were dead, he had nearly dies multiple times, he is always in the news and one of his friends hates him at the drop of a hat. To make it worse now he has to face down a dragon in the Triwizard tournament. He is done.

Harry is pissed and he is going to make sure that they all know it. He is taking his stand right now. Oddly enough he is going to make some friends along the way he didn't expect

There is quite a bit of bashing towards Ron and Ginny. A little bit towards Dumbledore. Quite a lot of angst coming from Harry and Hermione is a beast

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6248578?view_full_work=true]]

​

*Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them*

by evansentranced

Summary: Harry is an elf. No, he's not a bloody house elf. He lived in a place where they had got him confused with a house elf for nearly six years. They had him doing all the chores and he slept in a cupboard. Not a particularly cheerful cupboard, either. But he's not a house elf. He's a regular elf, thank you. Come on, people. It's like you're not wizards or something. PreHogwarts, NOT a creature fic. Character study. (Part 1)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/438516?view_full_work=true]]

​

*The Handbook of Elf Psychology*

by evansentranced

Summary: Harry is captured by wizards and brought to a castle. The wizards are obnoxious, but there's a lovely wood nearby which is quaintly named the "Forbidden" Forest. Harry thinks that's adorable. (Part 2)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/507700?view_full_work=true]]

​

*Tilting the World (On its Axis)*

by UnderlandsCreator

Summary: Harry always knew that there was something special about him, but it's only recently that he's been able to put a definite name to it.

He has magic.

Add to that the discovery that a whole world of magic exists, and Harry couldn't be anymore excited. But as time passes, and the longer he spends there, he soon comes to find out that the magical world isn't anything like how he thinks it should be, that it is, in fact, in many ways the exact opposite of what a magical world should be.

And since no one seems to realize how much better things could and should be, or how the magical world as it is in no way lives up to how wonderful and amazing magic is, Harry is left with only one solution to this problem.

Fix the magical world himself.

Make it better until it becomes fit to actually deserve the title of magical world, a place where any thing or person that has magic has a home in it.

Harry is determined to see his vision of what a magical world can really be brought to life, and he's ready to do whatever he has to, to make that happen.

*Marvolo's Ring*

by ImperialPepper

Summary: Vernon Dursley changes the course of wizarding history, when he gives his wife Petunia a ring for her birthday.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5673445?view_full_work=true#main]]

​

*Danse Macabre*

by RareAvian

Summary: "... The last glimpse of sunset, a green flash shoots up into the sky... Some say---"

"It signals when a soul comes back to this world from the dead."

---POTC quote.

The Higher Entities end up letting three souls have a second chance at life. One flash of green light the colour of death. Three souls return to the Living. History is rewritten. And Fate laughs.

Or...

The one story where Gellert Grindelwald takes a leaf out of Gru's book and adopts a kid despite being a former Dark Lord with no parenting skills whatsoever... And of course the kid is none other than Hadria Potter, who unintentionally drives him up the wall for all of three years. (After those three years, a number of people are driven up the wall, including Gellert, and it's totally intentional by now).

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9841367?view_full_work=true]]

​

*Stigma of the Wind*

by Luca_Crimson

Summary: This is a Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived story. Harry is the true boy-who-lived but is sent to live with the Dursleys, but later awakens an old magic which brings back two guardians to raise him. This is a few-bloodline fic, creature(sorta) fic, goes into their ideas of what being a pureblood vs, halfblood vs muggleborn is. Also goes into the types of magic. (I, FanfictionLister, made this summary because it honestly doesn't have one about what the story actually is. So, if someone reads and has a better idea for a summary please leave a comment with it and I'll re-edit with that one below! Thanks so much :)! ) (Series)

*The Sum of Their Parts*

Summary:

For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

Summary:

​

Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.

“The problem here, professor Dumbledore, is that you keep wondering what my position on the board is.

****** Yeah I don't blame you for not going my route it is a lot of work. Crtl+f can be a lifesaver lol. I've probably lost some bookmarks too as I moved from device to device. Another sorting method I use for unfinished and abandoned works, I put (UF) or (AB) in front of the title, finished works have nothing in front of them. I don't usually read fics with that low of a word count unless the premise is good or it just started. The best I've found to sort is by favorites(Fanfiction) or kudos(ArchiveofOurOwn), and add in a pairing if that's what you are feeling up to.

I recently had to upgrade my computer and i forgot to save the documents i had my lists in, onto a USB. so i lost those lists and had to redo them. thankfully they were still in my browser history so i could go back and find them but i'm pretty sure i still missed a few. In a few of my first lists i would say the word count, the gen and a few special notes but honestly there was so many, that i got lazy with it. I did that too for finding fanfics but after a while I just had to change it to update dates for the fics because it was easier to keep track of when something updates as well as when new fics showed up. I also don't usually put in pairing because i find that i miss out on good fics that way. As for word count I usually read 100k+ but sometimes i come across good fics that are only around 20+ to 30+ so i give those a go if they're good enough.

******** That sucks, I always hated when I lost stories. I would recommend that you use google drive for documents, I've personally never lost a document with it, and so long as you have your gmail account you can access them. That's how I keep my bookmarks up to date from my computer to phone, the account is synced with my phone and computer so it auto updates on either. I don't always put in pairings or word filters, but I usually prefer fics with a pairing in it. So glad that my first comment on this sub turned into such an awesome conversation.

Be glad to have more conversations in the future, I'll be sure to follow you and pop in if you see fit to post more. Send me a message if you'd like, all I do is eat, sleep, and drink fanfiction. But it is 1am so bedtime for me, have a goodnight or day whatever it may be :) .

** I've been listing fanfics I like too but I've been using Google sheets to track tags, fic length, completion status, characters, etc. It gives you a much better overview and you can use the search function to look for specific fics and keywords that might not be in the fic summary. Or filter out discontinued fics and such

Have you considered using something like that?

In any case, thanks for sharing! Saving this to look through at a later time :)

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.
