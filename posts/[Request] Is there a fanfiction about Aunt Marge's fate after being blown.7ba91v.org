*** I do not understand. Harry Potter makes Aunt Marge to be blow in prisoner of azkaban and then leaves the house. We have no idea what happens between then and when the magic reversal squad arrive.

**** Being "blown" is a sex act. Being "blown up" is either exploding or inflating with air, depending on the context

***** Well then in this context obviously when Harry blew Aunt Marge it wasn't for sexy reasons.

******* Indeed, she did rise up to the ceiling so I see your point. But Harry was blowing her at the table for a bit first /before/ she blew up up to the ceiling. What I want to know is what were the events that happened after Harry left but before the ministry arrived to defatten her.

******** OK, I'm gonna call troll here. The "up" part isn't the floating part, if you blow up a balloon with your own breath it'll fall, but it was still being blown up. "Blow up" is what you call inflating, not the floating part. Inflation is never called "blowing"

*** I'm aware of that, but presumably they didn't arrive the moment Harry stepped out the door. There would have been some time where she was bobbing on the ceiling prior to the ministry arriving. What would Vernon have been doing? What would Aunt Marge have been thinking? What would Petunia have said? Was Doodley even aware of what's going on? How long were they waiting for? How did the ministry unfatten her, with a magic pin?

**** u/T0lias:
#+begin_quote
  What would Vernon have been doing?
#+end_quote

Raging about freakishness and being secretly glad someone stood up to his disgusting sister.

#+begin_quote
  What would Aunt Marge have been thinking?
#+end_quote

"I'm going to die and it's all that freak's fault!", interspaced with a lot of terror and panic.

#+begin_quote
  What would Petunia have said?
#+end_quote

"Oh my world, what are the neighbors going to think?! That horrid boy!" while being secretly glad someone made that horrible cuntbag shut the fuck up.

#+begin_quote
  Was Doodley even aware of what's going on?
#+end_quote

He was probably,

a) having flashbacks of getting his own pig tail,

b) feeling pleased that someone did that to Marge, even if it was his freak cousin (because Dudley is /that/ spiteful and Marge /that/ unpleasant), and

c) covertly eating any food he could sneak from the table while everyone's attention was diverted.

#+begin_quote
  How long were they waiting for?
#+end_quote

They probably responded within minutes after Harry left.

#+begin_quote
  How did the ministry unfatten her, with a magic pin?
#+end_quote

Something like a /Finite/ cast by two or three people at the same time would be my guess.
