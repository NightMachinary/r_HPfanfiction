I recently read a one-shot where Voldemort only learns of the prophecy after he's almost won the war (Britain turns into a pseudo-WWII Nazi Germany with ghettos for muggle-borns), but Lily and James (and Sirius and Remus) all survive in the end after a brutal war. It was heart-wrenching but absolutely brilliant and then afterwards I read [[https://instagram.com/p/BXln7I0HC1K/]] this post on Instgram and I've been feeling the feels.

I was wondering if anyone knew of any /really/ good Jily lives fics or even a fully-fledged one-shot. Preferably without Jily having seven other kids or anything like that, even better if Harry remains an only child (because James loved being one, and Lily and her sister ended up with a bad relationship). I'm tired of stumbling upon Jily lives that are just cliched, not very well written, and don't focus on the Potters relationships with each other in addition to Sirius, Remus, and Pettigrew (if you will).

Thanks :)

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

*** I don't think it's canon, but even if it was I just don't think it fits. /shrugs/ I just can't picture Harry anything but an only child. A lot of wizard families seem to only have one child. And it just doesn't fit with my idea of James and Lily. It's my personal preference, which is why I specified it.

**** I dunno, I've always kind of pictured the kid as someone who wouldn't be as happy as an only child as he would be with a couple of siblings. I just feel like people who would be willing to have a child in the middle of the war are people who really want children.

***** I'm sure! It just doesn't fit with my "image" of the Potter family and I've never read an HP story with a sibling that wasn't cliched and the OC didn't seem Mary Sue-ish in many ways. I'd love to be rec-ed one that makes me feel differently of course!

** This fic's premise is "McGonagall raises Lily and Petunia". and the effects that has on canon. The war goes very differently; it reminds me of And the Wolves All Cry, in that regard.

It's a good fic, highly recommend it!

Edit: Wow, I just realized it's by the same author. No wonder it felt similar!

  Mr. and Mrs. Evans are killed when Lily's only a girl, and she's supposed to go to a home with her sister. Instead, a relative they didn't know they had comes to collect them, and introduces Lily to manners, magic, and a life that's just the slightest bit different from the life she was supposed to live.Or, an AU in which Minerva McGonagall raises Lily.

*** I should've looked at the authors FF page! I closed the link quickly (because it was a one-shot I thought I was going to read quickly and wanted to get back to a chaptered fic I was reading) and didn't even think to look at what else she'd written! Thanks for the rec :)

***** Just spent the last two hours reading it. While I think the idea behind the two fics are essentially the same (basically what if Jily survives the war and essentially Lily saves the wizarding world) if I had read them not knowing the same author I don't think I would have realised. If anything I would have though one was inspired by the other. Very interesting. Sunshine in My Eyes was a lot easier to read, probably because And All the Wolves Cry was like reading Life is Beautiful (the Italian Holocaust film). I also just visited her FF page and she wrote Just Stay Here Tonight (the Lily isn't a witch AU). I honestly never would have realised. Don't know what it is about the writing but these are my favourite AU fics and I never could have seen all of them written by the same author.

****** Yeah, all three of them are great. If I hadn't seen that they were all written by the same author, I'm not sure I would have guessed. But after finding out that were by the same author, my reaction was pretty much: oh, of course!

I think her characterization of Lily, no matter what the AU is, is always vivid and well-done, and she does a great job of portraying the war. That's what ties those fics together to me. There really aren't enough Lily-centric fics, especially ones that successfully make her into a three-dimensional character. She's a hard character to write - we don't see a lot of her in canon, and that we do see is always about her in relation to someone (James, Harry, Severus). It's easy to focus on those parts of her identity and maybe add some superficial characteristics to her and call it a day, but good authors go beyond that.

Sorry for the rambling :P I got away from myself.
