I know this is weird but I once read a very good time-travel fic in another fandom and I'm dying to read something similar in HP-verse, so I thought maybe there was already something like this out there. I would love to see Harry travel back in time after the end of the books, he travels back by accident and as an adult, maybe into the marauders era or maybe to the era when Dumbledore was young, prevents all the tragedies from happening (for example destroys the horncruxes very early on) and realizes at one point that he's not changing his own past but has created a new time-line with his travelling and stays in that universe as a friend with whoever he met on his travel.

Of course I guess there cannot be a fic that's exactly like this, but maybe there is one out there that contains some of the elements?

Edit: Just realized I can't change the titel, oops. What I meant is that I'd like for the story not to be focused on romance and stay close to the original plot where it can.


** I feel like there must be hundreds of time travel fics like that. It is an exceedingly common trope.

Adult/post war time travel: wind shear, backwards with purpose and altered destinies come to mind.

Realised it is a different dimension (not all adult ): the second string

Stays there: I know I have read them. But I cannot remember the title.

And this is what I remembered in one minute. There must be combinations

*** Thanks, I'll check them out. Most of the time travel fics I've seen are travels back from a future where everybody died or Voldemort won or both, I've never seen one where they travel back from the end of book 7.

**** Well, you only travel back if there's a reason. Why do it if you already won and everyone lived?

Jamie evans and fate's fool is another one where Harry is a grown up when he travels back.

***** You know, there are fics out there where ppl travel accidentally, like the one from the other fandom I mentioned. For some reason I like the original plot too much to change it to a complete defeat, but there were also so many sad things that happened I would love to be changed, so traveling back after the original plot by accident is actually kind of perfect to me...

Many of the descriptions have accidentally, or thrown back, or fate had other plans in them, making me think Harry might not have been planning on it.

Fanfiction.net also has some time travel communities

** linkffn(Delenda Est) is a decent time travel fic where the travel is purely accidental (from Harry's point of view). Almost all opinions I've seen of this is good for the first half, but divided on the second half (you'll notice what I mean with "second half" if you read it).

linkffn(Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always) is the second fic I ever read (after HPMOR), and the first I really liked (and got me into HP fanfiction). The time travel here is intentional.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

**** Yes, but I'm not a big fan of how the author changed part III. It seemed to me that the author wanted to just get it over with more than anything.
