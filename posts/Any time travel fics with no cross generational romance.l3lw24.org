I like the idea of Snape making friends with someone in a time travel scenario (preferably Draco but that's probably too specific), but I would preferably read something without any romance- unlikely, I know. Barring that, can anyone rec a fic where Harry Potter era characters time travel to the Maraunders era, with at least no cross generational romance?


** Harry Potter Era to 1st War:

The Second String. This is the best time travel story. It has adventure, suspense, drama, heartbreak, humour, everything I adored it. Harry doesn't meet his parents, he fights in the war for his own reasons. It's a wonderfully unique story 10/10. linkao3(The Second String by Eider_Down)

Timely Errors. This is also a good time! There's a lot of tension between Harry and the Marauders that was new and fun to read. Bit different. A good story, especially since Harry has a suspicious amount of experience with Unforgivables that make him interesting. 8/10. linkffn(Timely Errors by Worfe)

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

  Harry Potter never had much luck, being sent to his parents' past should have been expected. 'Complete' Time travel fic.
