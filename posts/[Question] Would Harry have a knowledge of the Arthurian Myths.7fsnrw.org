Basically is Arthurian Mythology taught in English primary schools? I doubt Harry would have access to any supplemental reading, unless he learned of it in school I don't see how he'd learn of it.

Somewhat related: Is Binns ever confirmed to have taught anything besides Goblin Rebellions?


** Chamber of Secrets, Chapter nine, he talks about the International Warlock Convention of 1289.

The Goblin Rebellions don't really come up until fourth year.

** Probably not.

Even coming from Wales, I was taught a lot from the Mabinogi and from other Welsh myths (like Beth Gelert), but not so much about King Arthur and the Arthurian legend. While it isn't taught in schools, however, it's very common to have older compilations of children's fiction in school libraries. I'm pretty sure that was my first understanding of King Arthur as something other than as a vague figure in popular culture, and it's certainly feasible Harry'd pick up a book from a school library shelf.

Many schools encourage children of a reading age to take a book home from their library every week, or spend 1-3 hours in the school library every week as a break in between classes, so he could easily get hold of books in that fashion.

Arthurian legend heavily influences a lot of fantasy television in the UK, as well as films like the one Taure has mentioned, so he'd probably be aware of the figures by name, even if he didn't know the actual legend. Most people would know Arthur, Myrddin Wyllt/Merlin and the Knights of the Round Table, even if they didn't know the names of every knight or foe within the canon of the legends.

**** I think this is the exaggerated abuse shown in fanon speaking. In canon Harry knew the names of all Dudley's favourite TV shows which I think demonstrates that he is, at the least, permitted to be in the vicinity of what Dudley is watching. And Sword in the Stone is shown frequently, especially around Christmas time.

Similarly, the Dursleys aren't as magic-phobic as fanon likes to portray them. Vernon jokes about magic carpets in PS, for example.

As with many things, fanon has basically taken the most extreme behaviour shown in canon and interpreted it as normal.

***** I'm not sure, but Dudley doesn't strike me as someone who'd enjoy Disney movies. Too "girly" for his tastes, even the ones that weren't about princesses. If he happened to see a Disney movie play on TV he'd probably just go "boring!" and change the channel.

******* Doubt it... He'd be too busy looking at pictures of her cats. :)

In the first book, it's established that Harry HATES going to Mrs Figg's because all she ever lets him do is look at cat pictures. She lets him watch television that one time when she's broken her leg, but that seems to be an exception.

******* Made up. Not sure what it was about, but "the great" did bring my thoughts to stage magicians... which is unlikely, considering how much the Dursleys did not like magic.

I don't think they would have punished Dudley for watching a stage magician or anything, but I can more easily see Petunia going "you don't want to watch that rubbish, poppet, how about we rent a movie instead?"

I had a thought, though: What if "The Great Humberto" is actually one of those people who reveal how magic tricks are done? That's certainly something Vernon and Petunia would wholeheartedly support Dudley's watching of, and certainly not mind if Harry saw either because it would show him that magic wasn't real.

***** Oh yes "exaggerated abuse" or as I like to call it the sticking your head in the sand. It is of course exaggerated abuse that Harry grew up living in the cupboard Under the Stairs and Dudley had two bedrooms. It is of course exaggerated abuse when Petunia takes a swipe at Harry with the frying pan in Chamber of Secrets. It is exaggerated abuse that the only reason Harry is allowed to go to the zoo is because Mrs. Figg broke her leg. It is exaggerated abuse that Dudley for his birthday received over 20 presents, whereas Harry for Christmas received a 50 pence piece. Vernon encourages Dudley to hit Harry with his Smeltings Stick to go get the mail in Philosopher's Stone.

I hope you're never in the position where an abused child needs to have their family reported. If it's up to you, or a large chunk of the Harry Potter fanfiction community, that child is stuck there.

Vernon mentioning flying carpets would definitely be a character inconsistency given how he reacted to a flying motorcycle that Harry mentions having dreamt about, however, he mentioned them in order to mock Harry (yet another exaggerated abuse according to you) , "Funny way to get to a wizards' school, the train. Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?"

****** 1. Abuse is not binary. It is possible to exaggerate the degree of abuse. Calling it an exaggeration does not mean there is no abuse.

2. My post clearly referred to the abuse depicted in fanon, not canon. So, for example, in fanon Harry is frequently literally locked in his cupboard for long periods of time, whereas in canon Harry being locked in his cupboard is simply what Americans call "grounding" - he still leaves the cupboard during these periods to e.g. go to school. That is an example of exaggeration.

In future I would recommend reading the post you are responding to before you kick off.

****** That's more emotional abuse than physical. We don't really see physical abuse in canon except for the frying pan thing. As for the zoo thing, my parents have taken my siblings out but not taken me. Everyone does it. It's not special to Harry.
