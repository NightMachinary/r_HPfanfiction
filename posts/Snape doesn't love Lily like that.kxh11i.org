I was posting a question, and I had this thought...

We all see Snape as being romantically attracted to Lily, but he only ever says he loved her. What if he actually loved her as a sister, or just had that friendship kind of love? I thought it'd be cool, and I'm going to include it in some versions of my headcanon.


** I think it would be likely that Snape would care a lot more for Harry, perhaps openly.

**** I'm pretty sure Snape's... grudge, with James isn't because “boo-hoo he took the love of my life, she was mine!” and more... y'know... “that bastard tormented me for years”. James getting the girl is the cherry on top of the shit cake if you will.

***** I feel like "tormented me for years" is a bit of a stretch, as by all indications he gave as good as he got. But in the end, Snape's poor (to put it lightly) treatment of Harry is born of a combination of his obsessive loathing of James, and his obsessive infatuation with Lily. The man clearly doesn't do emotions in half-measures.

****** True. And he certainly is obsessive. But saying that "he gave as good as he got" doesn't really apply when it's 4 v.s 1 (all the mauraders). Plus, in all the times we do see (the train and at the tree), they instigate it first. Plus, we know he's a slytherin, and intentionally taking 4v1 fights doesn't seem very cunning

****** Gave as good as he got is an argument that always intrigued me... 4-1 is never a fair fight. “But they have magic”, that's true, yes, but that makes it worse does it not? 4 people with magic against one, magic coming from all sides at yourself and you can only defend one side. Of course, you could argue that Lupin never took part, in which then it's 3-1; you could also argue that we never see Peter take part so that leaves us with 2-1, which is still unfair. Perhaps it would be less unfair if this was a non-magical world and Snape's knowledge of more magic was instead martial arts, but this is a magical world and it doesn't matter how much dark curses Snape did or did not know---it's still 2 people against one, and those people were talented at magic and could corner Snape easily. Remember they also had the map.

******** The only thing that's said about Snape is that he referred to Muggle-borns as Mudbloods. I don't think he was a bully... not like the Marauders anyways because Lily preferred his company over James's until Snape insulted her. It was more that he hung out with bullies such as Mulciber.

  "We /are/ [best friends], Sev, but I don't like some of the people you're hanging round with! I'm sorry, but I detest Avery and Mulciber! /Mulciber!/ What do you see in your, Sev, he's creepy! D'you know what he tried to do to Mary Macdonald the other day?"

  Lily had reached a pillar and leaned against it, looking up into the thin, sallow face.

  "That was nothing," said Snape. "It was a laugh, that's all-"

  "It was Dark Magic, and if you think that's funny-"

  "What about the stuff Potter and his mates get up to?" demanded Snape. His colour rose again as he said it, unable, it seemed, to hold in his resentment.

  "What's Potter got to do with anything?" said Lily.

  [skipping ahead 'cause the next little bit isn't really relevant]

  "I'm just trying to show you they're not as wonderful as everyone seems to think they are."

  The intensity of his gaze made her blush.

  "They don't use Dark Magic, though."

  [skipping ahead again]

  "I know James Potter's an arrogant toerag," she said, cutting across Snape. "I don't need you to tell me that. But Mulciber's and Avery's idea of humour is just evil. /Evil,/ Sev. I don't understand how you can be friends with them."
#+end_quote

Then, about a page later:

#+begin_quote
  "It's too late. I've made excuses for you for years. None of my friends can understand why I even talk to you. You and your precious little Death Eater friends - you see, you don't even deny it! You don't even deny that's what you're all aiming to be! You can't wait to join You-Know-Who, can you?"

  He opened his mouth, but closed it without speaking.
#+end_quote

So, while Snape wasn't confirmed to directly participate in bullying far worse than what Lily, who despises them, believes the Marauders would ever do, he doesn't have any problem with other people doing it, nor with supporting and defending those people, so the idea that he /did/ directly participate at some point, and that we just didn't hear about it, really isn't a stretch, especially considering that we hear nothing about his final two years at school, a time when he'd burned his bridges with Lily and had no mentioned friends except the aforementioned bullies.

* edit: rather, I should have said that we don't know whether Snape directly contributed to /physical/ bullying, but we 100% know they he was bullying muggleborns verbally. Lily explicitly states that he "call[s] everyone of [her] birth mudblood."

********** Honestly... I think he's worse a human as an adult. I will admit that as a stupid teenager, while I was not directly participating in it, I condoned and encouraged bullying. But that's being a teenager. As an adult I condemn any form of bullying but I suppose that's true for most adults as they become more mature. Snape was an actual bully as a teacher.

******* <snape fought with dark curses which is more dangerous than the hexes the marauder used.

I know we like to just look at numbers at see if something is fair, because we think it is more objective, but you have to think about other stuff as well. I mean sure 5 guys against 50 seems unfair, but if those 5 guys have rifles while the 50 have stones, it shows you a very different picture.

Look at it like this those fights were 1 guy with a knife and the other side fought with fists.

Sure fists can do a lot of damage as well, but the knife is a lot more dangerous and that makes it more even in my eyes.

******** Except it's not rifles vs. stones, it's wand vs. wands. With a rifle all it takes is a press of a trigger and it goes and it goes until you have to reload; however, with a wand each individual has to choose a target, say the words, and move the wand the correct way before casting. That probably isn't easy in a tense situation, especially vs. 2 people, maybe for an adult with experience it'd be easier but we're talking about kids. So now we have a situation where (assuming Peter and Lupin aren't participating) Snape is facing off 2 people who have been said to be skilled with magic (my point here was they weren't average or below average, but actually talented, so it's not as if Snape was facing easy opponents), Snape has a couple of choices:

a) shield himself from the oncoming attack

b) pick a target and cast a spell and hope it puts that person out of the fight

The only problem is, with option b, he leaves himself open to the other person who's attacking him, simply put, no, it isn't fair. And even if, let's say for arguments sake, that Snape could take on 2 people without too much trouble, James and Sirius also had not only the invisibility cloak but the Marauders Map. They had the element of surprise, it hardly matters how proficient you are at duelling against multiple people when they've already got the drop on you.

You're right, we mustn't look at just the numbers (for instance we must take the map and cloak into account as well), but we also cannot deny the numbers are also an important factor.

************** I don't know. The only two interactions between the Marauders and Snape as kids shown in the book put the Marauders in the wrong: Sirius and James being assholes to him on the train because he made a comment about Gryffindors and then picking on him because "he exists" (as James put it). We also know about the time when Sirius sent Snape to his death. Everything else is too general and told by unreliable narrators to draw a conclusion. So I suppose it's up to the reader's interpretation. My headcanon remains that the Marauders were bullying Snape but Snape also fought back. That's why Snape is so hateful, while Sirius never spares him any thought when he is not around.

He even fought back in the middle of the infamous bullying scene:

#+begin_quote
  But too late; Snape had directed his wand straight at James; there was a flash of light and a gash appeared on the side of James's face, spattering his robes with blood.

Snape was very capable of defending himself and fighting back.

** While it was years ago I read it, I think linkffn(A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles) portrays his feelings as platonic.

The sequel does imply a romantic interest however; there is a situation where Harry tries to tell Snape while they're viewing a memory of his together (it makes sense in context) that he is misinterpreting a situation and that Lily clearly has feelings for him at that point, with Snape doing the equivalent of putting fingers into his ears and saying "lalala I can't hear you", because he desperately doesn't want to acknowledge that he actually had a chance with her at one point had he behaved differently.

** I don't know how canon accurate this is but I generally refer to hpmor for Snape's characterization

The Potions Master shook his head. "It doesn't matter," said Snape. "Out of curiosity, what would you think if that boy were still in love with you years later?"

"Um," she said, feeling a bit confused, "that would be totally pathetic?"

The torch crackled a bit in the cavern.

"It's strange," Snape said quietly. "I have had two mentors, over the course of my days. Both were extraordinarily perceptive, and neither one ever told me the things I wasn't seeing. It's clear enough why the first said nothing, but the second..." Snape's face tightened. "I suppose I would have to be naive, to ask why he stayed silent."
