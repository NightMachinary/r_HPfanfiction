:END:
I may be thinking of two different fics, and if someone knows both of them, I would be grateful if you posted the links.

In the first fic, a Muggle(maybe the prime minister) tries to blackmail Harry, and Harry turns the tables.

In the other, which might have a sequel; Harry is essentially a super genius, Lily somehow comes back to life, and Tonks can metamorph her organs around.
