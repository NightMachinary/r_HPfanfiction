(Basically, what if Monty Python and the Holy Grail was a surprisingly accurate representation of the middle ages in the Harry Potter universe)

Edit: Nice, a typo in the title :/

** Most magical people know that "Imperio", "Crucio" and "Avada Kedavra" are curses that are considered unforgivable, dooming its user to a life sentence in Azkaban upon capture.

Back in the day though, there were curses so foul and vile that only the most evil or most desperate would dare to use them, as the curses corrupt the user's soul irreversibly.

What are those ancient and unholy curses?

"Ni" "Ni-ping" and "Niii-wom"

According to the legends, only one group is known to have survived long enough to tell the tale and if He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named ever learns the secret of those five curses, locked deep beyond the bridge of death, within the Cave of Caerbannog, there will be no way to prevent a victory for the Death Eaters.

  Harry: How you Death Eaters say, I one more time-a unclog my nose in your direction, sons of a window-dresser! So, you think you could out-clever us DA with your silly knees-bent running about in dancing behavior! *I wave my private parts at your Cissy, you cheesy lot of second hand electric donkey bottom biters*.

  Lucius: In the name of our Lord, we demand entrance to this sacred castle!

  Harry: No chance, Death Eater bedwetting types. I burst my pimples at you and call your door opening request a silly thing. You tiny-brained wipers of other people's bottoms!

  Lucius: If you do not open this door, we shall take this castle by force! [shit splats] In the name of our Lord and the glory of our-- [shit splats again] Right! That settles it!

  Harry: Yes, depart a lot at this time and cut the approaching any more or we fire curses at the tops of your heads and make castanets out of your testicles already! Ha ha!

  Lucius: Walk away. Just ignore them.

  Harry: And now remain gone illegitimate faced buggerfolk! And, if you think you got nasty taunting this time, you ain't heard nothing yet! Daffy Death Eaters! Thpppt!
