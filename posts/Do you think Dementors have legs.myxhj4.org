They are always described as gliding or floating or flying. So do you think Dementors have legs or do they have just a head and a cloak or do their bodies just gradually transition into the realm of non-beings such as in the case of lamp djinns?

** I think they do. I always imagined them having like a humanoid body with black skin and being super thin beneath their cloaks even though the cloaks are like part of their being(?) You know like a turtle and their shield. That being said I don't believe the cloak grows out of their skin but now that I think about it, I doubt anyone but a Dementor themselves would be able to move their cloak. Like i doubt the ordinary wizard could just lift a Dementors hood - not that it's likely that anyone would've ever tried

** u/Taure:
#+begin_quote
  Standing in the doorway, illuminated by the shivering flames in Lupin's hand, was a cloaked figure that towered to the ceiling. Its face was completely hidden beneath its hood. Harry's eyes darted downward, and what he saw made his stomach contract. There was a hand protruding from the cloak and it was glistening, grayish, slimy-looking, and scabbed, like something dead that had decayed in water...

I think when JKR introduced Dementors, she intended them to be made from dead human bodies, so I think they were originally intended to have legs.

But probably due to the movies everyone (including JKR) now imagine them as floaty things.
