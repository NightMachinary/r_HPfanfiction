:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I've tried every iteration of Google searching I could come up with. I tried hunting by phrases I'm 98% sure were used, but I could be a word off. I've tried just about every day for two weeks. I went back in my FFN account history to its infancy. I must now set aside my ego and ask for help.

The majority of the fic- past the opening scene, in fact- is after the defeat of Voldemort at the battle of Hogwarts. It's an AU in which Severus is not a complete bastard and takes in Harry as his ward(?) after the final battle, in which Harry uses the killing curse to dispatch Tom. It is specifically mentioned that it is a killing curse powered by love, not hate, and that's why it defeats Voldemort. I believe it was published prior to the release of book 7, mayyyyyybe even book 6. During the course of the fic, Harry begins having issues with his magic? I can't remember if it's like accidental magic or something else entirely, but he's having issues and develops a power called "radiance" in which he can distinguish magic and/or life force from objects and living creatures. He can walk in an alternate dimension (I think it may have been the curtain between life and death? But I can't remember for sure) and he seeks help with this ability from a Shaman or medicine man-type figure in I want to say Norway or somewhere above the Arctic circle. The ending reveals it's an AU where the Harry we know from the books briefly appears to the Severus of the fic and they discuss that Book Harry's Snape died. I remember reading it and being captivated by the incredible world-building done and want to read it again if I can find it.

So, I turn to you, my fellow fanfiction enthusiasts. Any of that sound familiar???
