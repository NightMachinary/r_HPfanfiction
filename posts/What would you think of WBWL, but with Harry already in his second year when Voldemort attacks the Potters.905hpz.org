** It's an interesting concept, but you would really need to mess around with the timeline to make it work properly. If Harry was born in 1980, does that mean that the first war with Voldemort lasted a decade longer than that of cannon? Or did James and Lily go to school a decade earlier?\\
I do think that it would be an interesting story if you had a young teen trying to take care of their sibling following a child-who-lived incident. Though instead of a second year I would write them as someone who was a fifth or sixth year, and suddenly had the responsibilities of a younger sibling and head of their family thrust upon them before they finished school.\\
In any case, this is something that I haven't seen before, and wouldn't mind reading.

** It sounds interesting but your Harry would have to be vastly different from canon or even most WBWL stories because not only does this Harry have loving parents (unlike canon and WBWL) he's also unlikely to be the super clever and Slytherin Harry that you find in WBWL. Basically this Harry would be completely average if better at magic than your average student.

** Why not just take out the Wrong part? Why does Harry always have to be the Boy-Who-Lived? It would be more interesting if he wasn't even the Boy-Who-Lived. I would read that. Just take out the overused bad trope. Or keep him as the Boy-Who-Lived. Maybe give him an older brother. Give Harry some time with his loving parents and his adoring but annoying younger sibling before you killing off James and Lily. It's sound so interesting.

How would Hogwarts change with the war going on still or is it still going on? Would Harry even go to Hogwarts having a madman after his family? How would Voldy get the Potters anyway? I would assume Sirius is the secret keeper if in your fanfic.

*** A harry that was or is loved and maybe cares for his brother. I guess Harry would be different to typical stories
