** Hardly. You're creating a strawman here. Almost everyone who is "pissed off" at Hermione is so because she decides in her mind what is best for an entire species, even if though goes against the wishes pretty much every member of said species. She then goes on her ill fated mission to free house elves by hiding poorly knit scarves and socks under junk in the Gryffindor Tower, hoping to trick a poor house elf into "freedom", with no thought to the wishes of the house elf or the potential consequences of her actions. It is ironic, that in her desire to secure "freedom" for the elves, she really shows how little she thinks of their intelligence in her blatant disregard for their wishes.

Unlike most people who make mistakes in the series, Hermione never really acknowledges that she is in the wrong, either.

Dumbledore's treatment of House elves is far more wholesome: he is kind to them, does not keep them against their will and pays them if they want to be paid. If Hermione's attitude to house elves were something similar, I certainly wouldn't have minded at all.

******* Initially I was writing to dispute your claim, but as I wrote it out I found myself agreeing with you quite a bit.

Fred and George were jerks to Percy. Then Ron emulated his cooler older brothers in his dislike for Percy.

Ginny we don't have much info on, that I recall. In CoS, Percy was concerned about Ginny according to the diary, but then worried about her -rightly as it turned out- telling the others about Penelope. Although at the end of CoS, Ginny didn't want the others making fun of him. But on the third hand I don't think we saw her ever defending him.

Arthur and Molly we again don't see much of. But based on how much the twins continue to mess with Percy, I assume they never really reign the Twins and later Ron in. So Percy, again, has reason for resentment.

Bill and Charlie...the family dinner is the first interaction we see, and I don't recall anything happening. If there was, it was probably dismissed by them as the older brothers tweaking the nose of their overly serious younger brother, not realizing that after they left the twins took it upon themselves to continue the tweaking, but in a more malicious manner/amount. The next we see Percy has sided with the ministry, so Bill and Charlie have reason to be upset with him. But they don't know the constant "joking" he's endured from the twins, or how that's turned into dislike from Ron and a lesser extent Ginny.

******** I don't think there is a single moment in the book where any of them apart from Molly is just /happy/ for Percy. It's like he has to be taken down a peg no matter what he does. It's one of the strangest family dynamics I've ever read.

Again, when he leaves - it's blink and you'll miss it, but what actually happens is that he comes home to tell his father about his promotion at work, expecting him to just be /happy/, but then Arthur tells him he's got it all wrong, that he wasn't promoted because of anything he did but because of they want to keep an eye on his father. Was Arthur right? Most probably, but it's understandable why they ended up arguing.

I won't say they pushed him away, but they did make it very easy for him to up and leave them. I still maintain that Molly was the only one who had a real right to be mad at him.

*** This is exactly it - though I'd say although she may not directly acknowledge her mistakes with SPEW, she does seem to mature a lot by the end of the series and I really don't think she'd do anything as misguided as SPEW in the future.

Basically, her poor handling of civil rights is an intentional flaw of her character and I believe is beautifully handled by how she matures in later books. I don't think she needs to directly acknowledge that she was in the wrong to us (though she should to the house elves).

** People don't really get pissed off at Hermione for that, it's just seen as an example for why Hermione is stubborn, somewhat patronising, and unwilling to look outside her own narrow world-view.

Slavery is a terrible thing, but in human history, I would say there have been far more slaves that hated being slaves than those that liked it. It's the opposite with house elves, the vast majority of them prefer working for a family, and Dobby is one of the few oddballs who likes being free. Oddly enough, Dobby is the house elf equivalent (though the ideological diametric opposite) to an Uncle Tom.

Hermione assumes she knows what's better for the house elves than they themselves do, and uses Dobby as an example for why all house elves should be free while condescendingly dismissing any dissenting opinions from the other house elves. Her intentions are good, but she kind of comes off looking like a smug plonker.

I'd recommend reading some history research if you ever get the time. Before I did some in depth research into the temperament of the people during civil war for a college project, I used to think the same thing as you do now. I hadn't even considered the fact that human nature by and in itself resists change, whether for good or for bad.

The abolishment of slavery was one of the best things to ever happen to the modern world, but that doesn't mean that there weren't slaves that fought against that change.

I think they're pointing out that it has been established that the /majority/ of house elves want to work for a family, and the /majority/ of slaves wanted freedom. This creates a moral issue here, where by freeing house elves, you would put them through the stress and pain Winky went through, all because it's good in the long run. Hermione was definitely right that the slavery of house elves was wrong, but her actions were not the correct way to go about solving the problem. In fact, her actions could have been harmful. She wanted to solve the problem right away instead of allowing a slow change that would be better for the house elves and all of the legal/economic fallback from freeing them.

That is exactly what I'm saying is not true. Even minimal amount of research will tell you that the majority of slaves /didn't/ do anything to fight for their freedom because they were fearful of change, which is more than understandable.

And not only slavery, but other forms of historical oppression also show similar patterns.

Fights against oppression of women, creed-based racism, oppression of LGBT communities, all would never have started if one outspoken revolutionary minded individual hadn't fought back against the oppression and made a lot of noise to let the oppressed group know that it wasn't okay to stay oppressed. That it was okay to fight back.

However, the large amounts of slaves who actively attempted (an estimated 100,000 + slaves- a large percentage according to a quick google search) to escape using the underground railroad, shows just how many wanted freedom, even if they weren't out screaming it to their oppressors.

**** Not particularly, no, considering that Hermione enacts SPEW in and around Hogwarts, a place that does not mistreat its house elves, and is run by Dumbledore, who the house elves seem to adore.

Most of Winky's problems are self-inflicted addictions resulting from her inability to cope with being freed, the very thing Hermione is fighting for (and yet ignores the very obvious negative outcome of freeing a house elf willy nilly), while Kreacher and Dobby were servants to the Blacks and Malfoys, two notoriously dark families. If Voldemort is a Hitler analogue, then the Blacks are Heydrich and the Malfoys are Goebbels, /of course/ they'd be terrible to their house elves.

Using any of their stories (especially Winky) to justify freeing the Hogwarts house elves, who again aren't mistreated or abused in any way, is extremely faulty logic that reeks of patronising, psuedo-imperialistic condescension. Hermione's basically saying that a house elf's opinion on the direction of their own lives shouldn't be respected, but hers should because she's of a more enlightened, civilised species. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Man%27s_Burden][Sound familiar]]?

So, no: she doesn't know better than them. She's a teenager who doesn't know everything, blindly sticking to black-and-white morality while refusing to understand or /even acknowledge/ the nuances of a complex and morally grey issue.

***** It's not a complex or morally grey issue at all; claiming that is defending slavery.

House elves do not lose anything if they are freed: They can continue to work, can continue to be not paid, etc. etc. But, they gain the freedom to leave if they are abused - something at least two house elves dearly wanted.

So, if the elves do not want freedom, despite it offering only advantages, and despite that fact that their bondage hurts other elves, then they are in the wrong.

Starting at Hogwarts, where house elves are not mistreated, is even smart - since the free elves can keep working there, as Dobby proves, they can serve as an example for other elves that yes, freedom is not bad for them, but a good thing and that their lvies will only change for the better.

Blatantly untrue on both accounts. Kreacher didn't want to be free, he just wanted to have a "proper Black" as his master, not Sirius or Harry. Winky also didn't want to be free, and descended into depression and alcoholism because of it. Are you suggesting the very real possibility of inducing mental illness and substance abuse aren't disadvantages? Dobby is the only house elf we meet who wants unequivocally to be freed, and almost everyone in-universe agrees he's the oddball elf. A much more nuanced approach would have been for Hermione to advocate for the freedom of the elves, like Dobby, that want to be freed (though the number would be much smaller of course), rather than trying to trick unwilling house elves, who are closer to Winky, into freedom.

#+end_quote

You keep sidestepping the obvious flaw in your argument: the average house elf is much more likely to behave like Winky than Dobby. Dobby is consistently regarded in-text as being an oddball and a maverick, even among house elves; the common house elf would fall to pieces in the same way Winky does when faced with freedom. And that, is clearly not "their lives changing only for the better". The way you keep disregarding canonical fact and cherrypicking to suit your argument is the height of intellectual dishonesty.

The issue is that the Elves themselves don't see it this way. Some (like Dobby) see the issue this way, but those are said to be "odd" (implying that most elves don't act that way).

A better approach would involve gently educating the elves and encouraging this mindset, and then freeing the ones that have made the transition. Not just blindly freeing them without any regard to their feelings or wellbeing.

I agree that elves should be freed, but most elves would actively be harmed by being freed. They'd being going through a traumatic incident that goes against years of conditioning. Teach them to deal with freedom and then free them, don't just throw them to the wolves.

******** If you want to be technical, Kreacher's masters were the Black family, meaning those with the name of Black. Perhaps magically speaking, Narcissa and Bellatrix were no longer members of the family in terms of House Elf ownership because they married into the Malfoy and Lestrange families respectively. Blood-wise they were born into the Black family just like Sirius, but when it comes to the family name and marriage-wise, they had effectively left the Black family the moment they got married. Meaning that Narcissa would get access to the Malfoys stuff (i.e. Dobby, Malfoy vault, etc) and Bellatrix would get access to the Lestrange stuff (i.e. Lestrange vault, etc), but both would lose access to Kreacher as long as Kreacher wasn't free (or allowed to go to them per a loophole).

Sirius is the only living relative who is still a Black in terms of surname and blood. If House Elf loyalty was simply about blood relations, then Kreacher would be able to go off to Narcissa or Bellatrix without it being considered a betrayal. After all, Narcissa and Bellatrix were both born into the Black Family. But since Narcissa is now a Malfoy and Bellatrix is now a Lestrange, with neither being Black anymore, Kreacher is not obligated to serve them. If Kreacher did things for Narcissa or Bellatrix, he would be doing it because he wants to no differently than Dobby helping Harry because he wants to.

So in summary, Kreacher couldn't go to Narcissa and Bellatrix because they aren't members of the family as far as House Elf magic stuff seems to be concerned. Kreacher serves the Black family, not "the Black family plus all the Blacks who married into other families". Meaning Sirius was Kreacher's only master, and if Sirius freed Kreacher, then Kreacher would just betray the Order anyway which would be a bad thing.

When Harry got Kreacher in Sirius' will, it was explicitly mentioned that if Harry didn't become Kreacher's master then Bellatrix would gain ownership of Kreacher. Since Sirius was the last Black, it meant he could effectively give Kreacher to whoever he wanted, and if that person refused, then Kreacher would go to Bellatrix anyway since once Sirius' preferences are out of the way, Kreacher would go to his living blood relatives regardless of their current name. I assume if Bellatrix refused, Kreacher would go to Andromeda, and if she didn't take him, then it would go to Narcissa, and if not her then Kreacher would go to Draco, etc.

** It is interesting that no-one in canon remarks on the parallel. Hermione isn't the only muggleborn student, nor even the only muggleborn in Gryffindor. Its possibly justifiable that wizards wouldn't have known about the history of slavery in the muggle world, but muggle-raised students should have had an inkling.

It may well be the case canonically that house-elves and wizards have a symbiotic relationship - I've seen it explored in fanfic that house-elves might be empowered by living in close proximity with wizards, and that it can even be a high for them - but Hermione raises valid points. Essentially Hermione feels so passionate about it because every time she tries to raise it, everyone around her shuts the discussion down, and Hermione being Hermione, she can't help but see the parallels to how human slaves would have been treated by their masters. Nobody offers her an alternate explanation. To be honest I would say that's a chronic problem in the wizarding world and is the source for a lot of Hermione's passionate beliefs and why she occasionally goes down the wrong path - this is a girl who finds herself thrust into a brand new world and so often finds herself without any sources of guidance about certain aspects of this world, because its assumed that students will know so much already.

In many ways it really is a world for wizards. Sure, some progressives will let muggleborns in; but they sure don't seem to give them any help acclimatising or educating themselves about certain aspects of wizarding life about which they would otherwise be ignorant. Again, I've seen plenty fanfics that explore this as a source of tension between purebloods and muggleborns - neither is educated about each other's customs in a patient and unbiased manner.

She doesn't bother to talk to a house elf before setting out on her crusade, and tries to trick them into freedom. Sure, convincing the elves themselves that they should want freedom would take longer, but it's also the right thing to do.

She believes in their freedom, which is a great goal, but in reality she treats them like pets or small children - just because she does so more benevolently than an abusive master would doesn't make it right.

I feel like her work with SPEW did more harm than good, don't remember exactly but i think the Hogwart's Elves didn't exactly like her, but I would think, that her Ministry career would have done good work with that goal, with Hermione having more experience.

** Part of it might be that disturbingly many people --- the sort that write Draco as a suave and charming badboy with a heart of gold --- have a sort of an admiration for the pseudo-aristocratic pureblood society that the Malfoys exemplify; and from that perspective, they must have a good reason for the way things are, so Hermione must be wrongwrongwrong.

A similar form of nostalgia for the plantation aristocracy of the Antebellum South can be found in the United States, and it ends up driving comparable excuses for slavery.

(For the record, not saying that /all/ people pissed off about SPEW think this way; but I suspect that quite a few do.)

Exactly!

Royalty is often romanticized in our own world, and the ancient ways and customs treated as mysterious, sacred and interesting. They're described as something greater than the mundane, oftentimes completely ignoring the dirty reality that lies as the foundation to all the grandeur.

And so, a lot of the more naive fanfic writers take it upon themselves to present the pureblood world in a similar light, again, much like the real world, completely ignoring the dirty reality underneath it.

What results, is a romanticization of the concept of slavery.

This is a big part of it. Many pureblood fanboys want that sort of aristocratic life and use it as wish fulfillment. That's why we see Harry or Hermione actually being pureblood and part of old wealthy families in many fanfics.

With their admiration for the elite, they try to justify their actions (dark magic isn't bad, muggles are bad, house elf slavery is justified, etc.).

Speaking of Winky, let's pretend for a moment that she wasn't a house-elf but a human maidservant who had spent her whole life working for a family (as had her mother before her, etc., perhaps), changing diapers for their son, watching him grow into a criminal, helping cover up his escape, only to be betrayed and dismissed to spare her master's embarrassment. She finds another job, sure, but it's more of a charity, and all the other servants disdain her for having been fired, and the only one who is even remotely supportive is the "crazy" one. How many /humans/ wouldn't drink themselves half to death over that?

** I don't really have much to input on the matter, but I recently read a fic that put the house elf enslavement into an entirely new perspective for me because honestly I'd never really cared to look into it.

/A Matter of Decorum/ linkao3(131122), ^{and I don't want to hear anything about it being a SS/HG romance fic, that doesn't invalidate any of the points it made.}

A substantial portion of chapter three is spent between Snape and Hermione analyzing why her desire to free the house elves was seen as "(...)foolish, misguided." I can't speak for the part about Kreacher and Regulus Black because I hardly remember anything about it other than the general consensus in one of the [[/r/harrypotter]] discussions was that Kreacher stopped being so bitter when Harry treated him with respect, so it's possible that /that/ part of the argument was tailored to fit the fic's agenda. Regardless, it was really interesting and if anyone wants to read that part and give some insight on it I'd be happy to read their thoughts.

** Because House Elves are not "enslaved". The reason people don't like Hermione's view on House Elves that it is literally false. House Elves are literally not human, therefore it is not slavery.

Hermione is a muggle-born, imposing her muggle mentality upon wizards. She is supposed to be accepting of the culture she has been introduced to (the wizarding world) but she keep trying to make changes when in the long run, Hermione doesn't really know anything about why things are the way they are.

The reason that Hermione being wrong about House Elves is a recurring thing is because it is literally canon. There is a reason that Dumbledore never takes Hermione's side on House Elves. Hogwarts uses House Elves because it is normal for wizards, whereas Hermione comes from a muggle society so her view of House Elves is based upon that. The very fact Dumbledore never agrees with SPEW automatically confirms that Hermione was wrong because given how in favour of freedom and rights Dumbledore is, you would assume he would be on Hermione's side regarding House Elves. He ISN'T on that side because Dumbledore, like literally every other witch and wizard not named Hermione Granger, knows that Hermione is wrong.

SPEW is literally the entire reason that the likes of Lucius Malfoy hate muggleborns. From their perspective, they come into their world and try to get rid of wizarding traditions (e.g. House Elves) because it doesn't confirm to muggle standards. For all intents and purposes, Hermione was new to the wizarding world yet still had the arrogance to want to impose her own childish views of the world upon the wizarding world. It only makes the likes of Lucius look justified because they would be like, "look at this mudblood, coming in here, getting rid of our wizarding traditions".

Also, Hermione ignored the voice of the House Elves. With the sole exception of Dobby, the House Elves NEVER consider themselves enslaved and willingly work for their master. That is fact. In fact, House Elves love to serve their master and the master's family. Yet Hermione doesn't care what the House Elves want, she only cares about what she want and that makes her a selfish girl who despite her apparent smarts, is just as clueless as every other muggleborn deep down.

It just reeks of arrogance for Hermione to see that that House Elves love serving their masters, then ignore that to impose her own view of how they should live. Imagine if that happened in real life. Hermione's actions aren't that of a caring person, they are the actions that an imperialist nation would take towards its colonies, except its worse because Hermione has no position to tell House Elves what's good for them or to act as if she knows more about wizarding culture than wizards themselves. She doesn't own House Elves, she's not familiar with the wizarding world despite how she seems to her less-intelligent peers. She's just a muggleborn trying to force muggle logic upon wizards.

In fact, I think Hermione serves as a nice contrast to Voldemort. Both were raised by muggles. Voldemort may be half-blood, but he's basically a muggleborn when it comes to socialization. Taking that into consideration, it makes more sense why Voldemort believes House Elves are utterly worthless and underestimates them: because he's was raised by muggles and so isn't familiar with their power. He thinks House Elves exist to serve when in reality, House Elves serve because they enjoy it. It makes more sense because Voldemort seems to believe that magic can fix every single problem, and given his background, Voldemort's consistent underestimation of things like House Elves makes more sense.

Hermione and Voldemort are just as blind as each other when it comes to House Elves, but for slightly different reasons. Hermione's blindness is that she imposes her views onto another culture, ignoring the culture of the wizarding world. Voldemort's blindness is that he doesn't consider House Elves to be powerful, when in reality House Elves have their own magic which is different to wizards.

**** And yet Dobby was the ONLY House Elf that was ever treated like a slave, and given who his former masters were (the Malfoys), that shouldn't be a surprised. Would you consider pets to be "enslaved" for belonging to a family? No, because pets are domesticated and they belong to a family, and they don't get to choose their family. House Elves (excluding Dobby) aren't enslaved, they are domesticated.

The Malfoys are not the average when it comes to wizarding families and Dobby is said, numerous times to be weird because he is the EXCEPTION to the rule. Every single other House Elf is not enslaved and loves serving their master. "Enslaved" and "slave" in reference to House Elves only makes sense if it refers to how Dobby was treated by the Malfoys, and no other situation.

Just look at Winky. She loved serving her master and her family. She wasn't enslaved, she was carrying out her job and was only fired because she failed that job. After all, she let Crouch Jr (a dark wizard) escape when Crouch Sr had him in check. Crouch Jr almost escaped Crouch Sr at the Quidditch World Cup because Winky wasn't keeping an eye on him.

Kreacher loves the Black family. In fact, Sirius is the only member of his family to ever treat Kreacher badly, and that is purely because Kreacher agrees with the family's pure-blood supremacy ideals while Sirius doesn't. Sirius' view of Kreacher has nothing to do with Kreacher being a House Elf, it has to do with Kreacher's devotion to the family members that Sirius hates. Regulus literally died for Kreacher, so that's at least one member of the family who loves Kreacher. We can assume that the rest of the Black family never treated him horribly or enslaved him (e.g. Malfoys treatment of Dobby). I think that the Black family treated Kreacher well, all things considered. They certainly gave Kreacher a whole lot more respect than the Malfoys gave Dobby. Once you ignore Sirius, the only member of the Black family I could ever see treating Kreacher bad is Bellatrix, but given Kreacher's view of her, I highly doubt that.

So I don't consider House Elves enslaved, and canon supports the view that House Elves aren't enslaved. Hermione was in the wrong. Canon also supported the view that Hermione was wrong, particularly based on the fact that nobody (not even Dumbledore) sided with Hermione. Therefore House Elves aren't enslaved in canon. Dobby is the exception, not the rule. If a House Elf was "enslaved", it would be because that elf's master is ALREADY a terrible person, which doesn't count as House Elf slavery. House Elf slavery would imply that House Elves are treated badly for being House Elves, whereas the reality is that horrible people treat House Elves horribly just like those same horrible people would treat anyone else. Dobby is not a normal House Elves and this is actually stated in canon various times, meaning that Dobby is the only House Elf to ever be "enslaved" whereas the rest love serving their master.

Sirius is an exception to the rule regarding bad treatment because he hates Kreacher for how dark and bad Kreacher's ideology is. Sirius never once treated House Elves badly for being House Elves. If Kreacher helped the Order and was against pureblood supremacy as a result of Regulus' death, I am certain that Sirius wouldn't be harsh to Kreacher. In fact, Sirius would treat Kreacher as a friend if Kreacher wasn't so engrossed in the Black family ideology. The Malfoys don't treat Dobby badly for being a House Elf, they treat Dobby badly because the Malfoys were already bad people and Dobby doesn't like pureblood supremacy. If Dobby actually agreed with pureblood supremacy similar to Kreacher, then the Malfoys would have treated Dobby better.
