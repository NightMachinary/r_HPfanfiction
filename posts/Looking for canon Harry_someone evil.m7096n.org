Like the title says, looking for some fics with a canon Harry in a relationship with someone who is currently an evil character. Not redeemed and now they are good, but someone who is actually still bad.

I'd prefer no slash, novel length, and completed if possible, but I'll take one shots or WIP/abandoned fics if they are good. The era and genre doesn't matter all that much, and the evil character can be from canon or an OC, as long as Harry's characterization is as close to canon as possible the other stuff doesn't matter as much.

Thanks!


** I don't understand, why would Canon Harry want to be with someone evil? That would be ooc for him and therefore not fit in with your request because he is out of character

** You want an in character Harry to be with an actually evil partner? That's just not possible.

*** I could see a scenario where the evil character gets to Harry young and Is nothing but a nice person around him and he doesn't find out that they are evil until way later in life but by then he's already madly in love and just tries to not think about the evil stuff they do.
