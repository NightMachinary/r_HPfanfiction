I'll just state this up front (so you don't have to): as an acknowledged pedant, this probably bothers me more than it should.

When a wizard transports themselves from one place to another using the three Ds (destination, determination, deliberation), the verb form is apparate. Change it to the noun form, however, and somehow appar*a*tion becomes appar*i*tion.

I had put it down to a combination of bad spelling and auto-correction, because apparition is a "normal" word, whereas apparation is not. (An apparition is a ghost, vision, or mirage; something ephemeral or imagined.)

When I save a fic, I change apparition to apparation (unless it's referencing a ghost). But I just looked it up on the Harry Potter wiki (because I couldn't remember the third D), and even there it's spelled with an I.

Have I been mistaken all this time? While a Muggle witnessing apparation may think they've seen an apparition, these should be two different words.


** Yeah, I think the books have a person disapparate, apparate to a location, and learn apparition.

** I agree it should be Apparation, but JKR (or her editors) allowed the auto-correct to override this logical progression. As evidence I submit the use of Apparating and Disapparating used in chapter 2 of Book 5; also the term Anti-Disapparation Jinx in chapter 36.

Even better, this reference in Chapter 6 clinches it:

#+begin_quote
  ‘You two passed your Apparation tests, then?' asked Harry grumpily.
#+end_quote

In book six, they flipped to using the auto-correct version

#+begin_quote
  ‘But now all I've got to look forward to is stupid Apparition!' said Ron grumpily. ‘Big birthday treat ...'

  Three lessons on, Apparition was proving as difficult as ever, though a few more people had managed to Splinch themselves.
#+end_quote

By book 7, they'd even corrupted the departing version to use an 'i'

#+begin_quote
  The night reached such a depth of velvety blackness that he might have been suspended in limbo between Disapparition and Apparition.
#+end_quote

In the end, it's just further proof that things went awry for the series after book 5.

*** So, it appears the bottom line is that it is supposed to be apparation, and the editors just got lazy starting in Book 6. So I'm going to keep correcting it in my personal copies of things, and keep on thinking that people who use apparition are too lazy to override over-zealous spell-checkers.

*** Except Apparition is already a word in English, spelled with an ‘i'. Referring to an entity that appears unexpectedly, hence why it is applied to magical teleportation. To ‘correct' it to Apparation is legitimately wrong. To apparate and disapparate are neologisms and back-forrmations from the word Apparition.

**** They all derive from the root word 'appear', and while an apparition is a noun, Apparate is a verb, and of course they're neologisms, the whole process is fictional-world-specific terminology. That's why they're capitalized.

***** Yes and Apparition in context, is still a noun. To have two different spellings for the same word, when both meanings are already contained within the first spelling of ‘Apparition' is needlessly overcomplicated and fundamentally redundant. That's my point

****** Just to feed the pedantic urge -- it's not the same meaning, and there's a difference between a common noun (a thing) and an abstract noun (a process), particularly one that's verb-derived.\\
One could say that the wispy cloud effect seen in the movies is an apparition (a thing that visually appears like a person but is insubstantial, i.e.: a ghost-image) of someone's Apparation (the process of magically appearing out of nowhere as the endpoint of travel).

******* The key point is that your pointless spelling change is completely unnecessary, as the word 'Apparition' has multiple meanings one of which is 'The act of appearing or becoming visible' in both British and American English. Like all words, the precise meaning varies depending of context, because words can have multiple meanings.

** This whole time I thought it was apparation and it bothered me more than it should whenever I saw apparition but I just dug out both my copies of HBP and both of them say “Apparition Lessons” so maybe we've both been wrong this whole time? I still don't understand how “apparate” turns into “apparition” and not “apparation”
