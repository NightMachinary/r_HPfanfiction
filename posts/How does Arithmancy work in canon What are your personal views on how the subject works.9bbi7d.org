I've often seen Arithmancy used in fanfiction as a subject that helps you with spellcrafting. I think that's unlikely, however, as it would be a core class of it were that useful. However, by canon's definition, it's supposed to be divination by number. That'd make Hermione a hypocrite however, as it's just divination using entirely different methods. Or are there multiple different uses to it? And then she uses Numerology and Grammatica, which is learning the property of numbers.

What are your thoughts on how Arithmancy works as a subject? How could it be useful for a witch or wizard?


** I think its like it is in canon.

Hermione likes logic. Action leads to result. She can see the connection, she can understand it. If she does the correct wand motions with the correct pronunciation the spell works.

Trewlawney doesn't do anything. She just says things. Hermione can't see the process so she can't understand it. Divination by numbers could be seen as statistical likelyhoods. Actions have probabilities, framed like that Hermione can see a process. Its not nonsense and waffle. She works through the task and gets an end result.

Hermione is a muggle with a wand. She likes her logic. She doesn't like the more magical bits of magic. When Dumbledore called music a magic beyond all we teach she likely thought Dumbledore likes music. It is possible that there is magic in music. The love and sacrifice that Lily protects Harry with is vague, there is magic that is hard to understand that exists without a dedicated process but Hermione likes process.

*** Both Hermione and Tom Riddle saw magic as means, options, and tools to reach their political goals.

Although they were on opposite ends of the political spectrum, they had lots in common ([[/u/obversa][u/obversa]] made a good case here). If Hermione had not made friends with Harry and Ron, she could have walked down a very dark path.

I don't think Hermione would have became a Dark Lord if she didn't make friends with Ron and Hermione, it certainly would be a possibility but I would be surprised if she became that way. Tom Riddle had a much different childhood, from what we know about Hermione she loved her parents and they loved her. During these formative years they couldn't be more different.

It comes from me, seeing as how I wrote the original in-depth analysis of both characters, including listing all of their many similarities in the books. You can read the full post [[https://www.quora.com/Since-Hermione-was-such-a-talented-witch-do-you-think-if-she-was-evil-she-could-have-been-as-bad-as-Voldemort/answer/Amber-Goldsmith][here]].

Addressing your mention here:

#+begin_quote
  Hermione's qualities of loyalty, bravery, and selflessness are much more evident than power hungry, manipulative, and ruthless.
#+end_quote

A close re-read of the series reveals a Hermione that clearly has Slytherin qualities. They're also apparent in PS/SS from the start, albeit in a more subtle manner, and become more obvious as the series progresses. I cover these traits in Hermione's character and development in my close-read analysis [[https://www.quora.com/If-Harry-Ron-and-Hermione-had-not-been-in-Gryffindor-which-houses-would-they-have-wound-up-in-and-why/answer/Amber-Goldsmith][here]].

"Power hungry, manipulative, ruthless" are all negative traits, and are typically on the extreme end of Slytherin house. However, the vast majority of Slytherins, and even Tom Riddle himself, do not fall into this rather one-dimensional depiction. The books are quite clear that, when Riddle was at Hogwarts, everyone thought he as a charming, prodigial wizard and a "golden boy". Even Dumbledore admitted respect for Riddle's "brilliance" in COS.

While the reader knows that Riddle has these traits, they were not at all apparent when he went to school, or even for a time after he graduated. The same could be said of Hermione: the reason why many readers overlook her Slytherin qualities is because she typically keeps them carefully hidden.

Yet Hermione's ruthlessness - as seen with her treatment and attitude towards Rita Skeeter, Marietta Edgecombe, Dolores Umbridge, and even Severus Snape (she set him on /fire/ in PS/SS, with absolutely no remorse, second thoughts, or qualms) - is also one of the aspects of her character. Her ambition is also quite clear, even in PS/SS, where she mentions wanting to be in Gryffindor "because that's Dumbledore's house"...and Dumbledore is a great, accomplished wizard.

Also, Hermione /is/ manipulative at times. She literally manipulates Gilderoy Lockhart into giving her a pass to the Restricted Section in COS, using the same technique that Tom Riddle is later shown using on Horace Slughorn to get information on Horcruxes in HBP. In OOTP, she also uses manipulation in order to put the secret hex on the DA sign-up sheet, copy Tom Riddle's spells and tactics, and to trick Umbridge into going into the Forbidden Forest.

Before that, Hermione tricked Rita Skeeter in her Animagus form in GOF, and used the Time-Turner in POA while manipulating (even gaslighting) Harry and Ron in order to keep her use of the object a secret. In COS, Hermione used manipulation (Polyjuice Potion) in order to help get Harry and Ron to sneak into the Slytherin Common Room, etc...

#+begin_quote
  Tom Riddle had a much different childhood, from what we know about Hermione she loved her parents and they loved her.
#+end_quote

I'd point out that this is speculation. We don't really know all that much about Hermione's parents, and there are some indicators in the books that suggest that Hermione increasingly isolated and distanced herself from them as the books progressed.

Hermione spends the vast majority of the summer before second, third and fourth year with her parents, and some Christmas holidays. However, after that point, Hermione is shown increasingly spending time with Harry, Ron, and the Weasleys, instead of her parents or Muggle family.

There are also hints of Hermione's increasing distance from her Muggle parents as early as GOF as well, where she seems to be more emotionally volatile and easily upset than usual. We also never see Hermione writing letters to her parents, or discussing her parents and home / family life with Harry and Ron, in the books or films.

[[/u/OwlPostAgain]] wrote a great analysis of Hermione's drifting away from her parents on this thread [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/1bmlxu/why_is_hermione_at_the_weasleys_earlier_than/][here]], which also falls in line with what's hinted at and shown of her character in the books.

Well...she /did/ become Minister for Magic at an earlier age than what Slughorn predicted for Tom Riddle, and she had an enormous impact on helping to reform the Ministry of Magic, wizarding law and government, etc. I'd say that should count for more than enough potential to be as talented as, if not /more/ talented in some areas, than Tom Riddle.

#+begin_quote

Yes, she's Hermione. I'd also point out that, according to pathologists, [[https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/5gjbqk/we-asked-a-pathologist-a-bunch-of-questions-876][almost everyone and anyone is capable of murder]], as well as other dark acts, under certain circumstances. Even if you can't personally see her doing such things, she's certainly capable of it, especially in a scenario where Harry and/or Ron had been killed or threatened.

To me, Hermione could also turn Dark if, like Voldemort, she believes it is "the right and just thing to do", and if she truly believes what she's doing is "right". Like you stated, this approach would be "the ends justifies the means".

******** Hmm, is Cursed Child canon though? Either way, I don't think it requires magical power to become Minister. However, I do believe that Riddle is more talented, he's more creative and open minded, as well as more in tune with his magic than Hermione. He's supposed to be the most powerful dark wizard to ever exist. I don't think she's creative (Half Blood Prince book?) either but I haven't read the books in a long time so if you'd prove me wrong on this I'd be grateful, as I like to believe she can also be as talented ;)

That's an interesting study. I can see how a Gryffindor can turn dark as they can be overly chivalrous, and it isn't pretty but I just have a hard time believing Hermione would be THAT ruthless. Like you said, I'm biased, I can see how she's capable of it, but it's just my Hermione, so I can't see her being that morally unhinged. Well, she has Harry and Ron to take care of that, especially Harry.

*** Here's what I have so far in a Rumination file:

Perhaps Arithmancy isn't exactly about mathematics, so much as the meaning of numbers. Qabbalistic numerology ascribes certain qualities to each numeral. I've built up a headcanon about it somehow addressing how certain magic interacts with other magic.

Rather than be saddled with the arbitrary meaning of letters in names = factors, I figured that magical arithmancy was about typifying spells and substances to better understand how they interact.

It would have grown out of the intuitive understanding discovered in potion-making over the centuries, but might not have gotten a regimented treatment until the 1800's, when scientific method began to help weed out inconsequential aspects of magic ('while standing in a wooden pail filled with fishtails, during a waxing moon...') that the truly meaningful patterns began to emerge. Sorcerers always knew that hair made for the best source in Polyjuice, and that you can conjure water much more readily than milk, but arithmancy began to explain why.

[[http://www.astrology-numerology.com/numerology.html#numerology_introduction]] Numerology reference

1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9

s | t | u | v | w | x | y | z | _

6 - nurturing, balance, community, domesticity, service | stubborn, meddling, subject to flattery

7 - seeker of knowledge, perfection | suspicious, reserved, isolated

8 - judgement, decision-making, achievement | workaholic repressive, inhumane, materialistic

9 - friendly, congenial, humanitarian | possessive, attention-seeking

11 - double 2 - exaggerated spirituality and fear

22 - double 4 - architecting (but humourless)

[[[]]]

My problem with much of the 'real-world' numerology is how arbitrary some of the qualities seem, even moreso when applied to the naming of children; would prospective Jewish parents approach the scholar about best names for encouraging certain traits, or was their attempt to 'game the system' likely to create a monster?

So I went back to the numbers themselves- ignore history, ignore pure mathematics. What do these numbers mean?

[extract from A Story of Magic - as yet unpublished]

So, when we speak of arithmantic meaning, we are speaking of the whole of human spiritual culture, distilled into nigh-on universal meanings. These meanings vary with culture and you can see bias in the spirits of east Asia in comparison to those, say, of the deep Amazon, but their meanings are our meanings, often derived from more... mathematical truths.

One. It is the smallest, the sole object. Alone yet complete. It's geometric representation is a dot.

"Not a sphere?"

A dot. Zoom in on the dot and you will discover it is still a dot, because One has no subcomponents.

Two. The essence of communication. From here to there. Two is represented by a circle- the center and orbit. It is also the symbol for pain and loss and fear, for only by cleaving one into two did everything start to hurt.

Three. It takes the simple binary of two and adds a dimension, multiplying meaning, creating both dissention and dynamism. It is therefore also the number for creativity... and lies

Four. the first multiple. Symbol is --

"A square."

No, it's a three-sided pyramid. Four is a family, sustainable procreation. It is also stability and truth, for only by having two opposing sides sharing equal voice is there something to match against. It is also the first possible solid object- more than a shadow.

Five. The hand, artifice, the incomplete array, the broken star- it also represents humanity in our lost-our-tails aspect and unrestrained power.

Six. Armies. Two triangles arrayed at cross purposes. Also, a strong model for division and unification. Six also represents society and culture.

Seven is the soul, and location. It establishes existence. The geometric representation of seven is a double pyramid. One point at the center, one length out, forward and back, to left and to right, up and down. All connected, they form the double pyramid, a reflection of life in death. Perfection, but also isolation.

Eight. the cube, structure, architecting - also the compass, to chart a vector; plans and destinations

Nine. squares of trios, or the spiral - the unfinished grouping - community - the compass with a center, to represent the ship

Eleven and Twenty-two were made up, as far as I'm concerned.

There's too much culture behind it and not enough prehistorical symbolism. It's like they miscalculated the factors on two and four, then tried to shoehorn in a second meaning to flatter someone or cover their error.

** I imagine arithmancy as the "hard science" version of divination. Divination which is very concrete, strictly based in rules and numbers, with consistent, predictable outcomes. But I'm also someone who really likes the idea that Divinations isn't just the Hogwarts version of astrology, i.e. it isn't just woo fluff but (with a competent teacher) is actually a functional branch of magic. So I see Divination as more of an art, often relying on instincts about what /feels/ correct, with lots of room for interpretation and a lot more flexible than Arithmancy. It also, due to that flexibility, has the potential to be much more powerful -- but inconsistently so. In this way Hermione's position makes a lot of sense, as others have said. Even putting aside that Trelawney is a hack who can't teach, Hermione would like that Arithmancy is very predictable and logical and rules-based, and she'd see it as more valid because of that. Kind of like how people get very up-in-arms about hard vs soft sciences and write off "soft" sciences (or the humanities) as worthless.

Arithmancy could be useful for predicting outcomes of actions/paths, and making decisions based on which is more likely to be successful/more powerful/whatever. I can actually see that being useful for the usually fanon applications of arithmancy in spell-crafting or potion-inventing. One could use numerological translations to deduce which incantations/ratios of potions ingredients/steps are most optimal or are most likely to be effective.

** This was an idea I had for a project I never ended up writing, but did end up using it for a tabletop setting.

The way I think of it, the technical definition would be something like "A method to describe and analyze the magical components to an otherwise deterministic world." In other words, it's capable of finding fate and meaning in events using magical math. Somebody like Hermoine would reject it on the grounds that she views the world as a rational place with magic tacked on, where Arithmancy describes the world in a holistic manner - seeing no difference between the strictly mundane deterministic reality and the mystical power of meaning and fate. It's self-contradictory, presenting ideas like free will as something you can consistently describe and predict, while not actually opposing free will as a concept within its own framework. Accepting that contradiction and moving on from it is a major part of what makes a good arithmagician.

In practice, it would be wacky math. You would have brand new operations that work with a number's tone, color, mood, or any other adjective you wouldn't normally associate with a number. You might have narrative-like constants, such as the "sacrificial hero," a tone which appears consistently in events to shape the final outcome, and those can be put right alongside normal numbers and used in mundane operations. The mundane math and the mystical numerology-like components would work in concert, and could not only accurate describe what an event actually was in a magical sense, but to predict possible futures based on known current magical components.

It would look similar enough to mundane math that a muggle mathematician would immediately recognize it as math-like, but most of the time, it would be formatted differently. Entire chunks of a formula may not even follow normal order of operations, because some of the mystical operations change even that. The final product could even be animate, if what the arithmagician was trying to describe was complex enough. That would certainly cause a regular mathematician to throw their hands in the air and give up, but nonetheless, it's still fundamentally a mathematical system.

** My headcanon is that arithmancy is magical diagnosis. You need it to create spells, you need it to understand spells and its effects. Take broom making for example. You can use a levitating spell to make a broom float. But for precise steering and auto-leveling, you need arithmancy. Similar uses in curse breaking and medical applications. Applying it you can visualize magic as a logical entity, a function or an equation that you can analyze and manipulate. I also believe that floos addressing is similar to IP addressing. But here for each address you use arithmancy.

**** If you believe the spell invention side of arithmancy I feel like in curse-building many magical security systems are custom made for the places they protect, which means there isn't a general all purpose "Finite Incantatum" to get through them but rather a curse-breaker would have to derive their own counter-curse and make sure it doesn't trigger any fail-safe curses that blow them up whilst doing so.

***** We already know Finite doesn't work on everything, otherwise their wouldn't need to be specific counter charm, counter Curses and such for particular spells.

*** I think the probability aspect of it is exactly what Arithmancy is. Running the numbers to predict what will happen in the future. What magic is involved, who knows, but there's symbolic power in numbers like 3 and 7.

** If it's about the meaning of numbers than it might be a little more than initially suspected. Like, knowing the meaning of numbers could mean you know how to precede with certain magical spells-only casting on certain dates, casting a certain number of times etc (perhaps why it's needed for curse breaking).

Using it to predict the future could mean analysing events and what the numbers mean and therefore what that indicates. Sought of probability and based in more hard facts than divination.
