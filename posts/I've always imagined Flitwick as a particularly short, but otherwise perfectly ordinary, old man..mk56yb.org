That's probably why the fan idea that he is half-goblin always annoyed me (even JKR said he had "a dash of goblin blood", a dash is not much).

I know they had Warwick Davis portray him and the goblins in the films... BUT, I never thought of Flitwick as being part goblin. I always thought of him as someone who looked similarly to his image in hp-lexicon [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/character/filius-flitwick/][link]].

Anyone else ever thought of Flitwick as just a regular wizard? This goblin stuff is getting old for me...


** even if he is not half-goblin, I do suspect he suffers from dwarfism then, considering he has to, and I quote the books 'stand on a pile of books to see over his desk'

That is not just 'short'. That is unnaturally short to the point of either mixed heritage or some kind of physical defect.

*** I dunno. It's a world of magic. He's not described with any characteristics of dwarfism, short, broad body. He could be. But I never imagined him as such.

He could just be very short, without the dwarfism, after all... it's magic.

Also, he does have goblin heritage, just way, way back (according to JKR interviews).

**** 'it's magic' just seems like such a lazy answer. Like what type of magic?\\
a magical disease? a curse placed upon the family? This is a fanfiction subreddit, so we can at least get creative beyond 'it's magic. I don't have to explain anything' if we are not gonna stick to the more logical conclusions of either creature-blood or a birth defect.

after all, if it was a normal thing, we would see a lot more of it, but clearly Flitwick is VERY unique and thus something special must have happened to him beyond 'magic'

***** I... I have no answer...

Are you literally trying to make a fictional setting with people changing reality itself into a quantifiable system based on real world genetics?

How do you know if it's not normal? We have very little canon info on how such things work. According to canon Flitwick doesn't suffer from dwarfism and isn't half-goblin. He's not Hagrid... I don't actually know what you're arguing for... I really don't.

My post was about the prevalence of half-goblin Flitwick in fanfiction. How it is not canon. How it annoys me specificialy because I always imagined him different. I even provided an explanation for that portrayal (the films).

****** As an outside observer on this I'd just like to say that you completely blew this response. The poster above gave reasons why things are done and you are not the first person to point out the dash of blood. But there is nothing else ever given for flitwicks EXTREME body attributes. We were given something as a community and ran with it. That is why its prevalent and in this response thread I'm sorry to say that you are the one who isnt playing ball. The poster above pointed out several ways it could be and you shot them down because "its magic" you want to know where we hear the explanation "its magic" in around here? Poorly written fic or fics making fun of tropes(which are also normally bad. (Rationals of magic anyone?)

Once again I'm not trying to be rude. I'm trying to help point this out to you so you will see where the other poster and myself and others are coming from

*** Correct. The books say he has distant goblin ancestry, Rowling has stated that he has "a dash" of goblin blood. Everyone just assumes he must be half, presumably because Hagrid is explicitly half, but he is not.

The idea that he has some giant battle axe in a closet somewhere and is super respected by real goblins is also completely made up, though I'm sure you figured that one out yourself.

It is explicitly noted that nonhumans cannot use wands, so presumably anybody who was OBVIOUSLY partially nonhuman would have likely been denied the right to even carry a wand. Given the context of the politics of Harry Potter, I'm actually surprised Hagrid was able to get by the way he did. I assume Dumbledore had something to do with it. If Flitwick was obviously not human, then given his own age, it is likely he would not have been allowed to learn magic at all.

So while a half giant might be allowed to get a wand a half goblin might not.

**** I actually don't think Dumbledore would have had the influence to really do anything about Hagrid's situation at the time. Hagrid started at Hogwarts before Dumbledore became the defeater of Grindelwald, which was one of Dumbledore's first major accomplishments.

***** While agree he probably didn't have the influence - I've always interpreted that defeating Grindelwald was Dumbledores LAST major accomplishment or at the very least the one that made him a household name. Remember, on his Chocolate Frog card, mentions his discovery of the twelve uses of dragons blood and his work with Nicholas Flamel in the same breath as his defeat of Grindelwald. We also know that he was considered brilliant even at the age of 17.

I'd argue that he had plenty of accomplishments prior to defeating Grindelwald, but they were almost purely academic, and the defeat of Grindelwald was what made him known to the world at large.

** To me, whether or not he's goblin enough to appear to be a half gobiln is irrelevant. I get that your headcannon mightn't match other fanfics but in my mind that is what fanfiction is all about. (However he is less than a meter tall in every imagining I have of him)

The deus ex machina of goblins doing everything in a lot of fanfiction is often the way to have things happen in a way that doesn't really need to be a focus of the story. I think throwing in Flitwick as part of the goblin stuff is often done poorly. However, never once have I thought the inclusion of Flitwick as a 'part goblin' was the deciding factor in whether or not the 'goblin stuff' was done well or not.

I look forward to the story where he notably isn't a 'Member of the Goblin Nation' and instead more closely related to Yoda...

*** This is the reason why so many fanon tropes are so pervasive, like Fleur being functionally a full Veela or Luna actually having some form of special magical sense. There are a limited number of fleshed out characters a story can support, so you only see them in stories where the author doubles down on what makes them 'different' to add variety and make it more fun. Less 'why do this' and more 'why not do this' if you are going to bother to include it at all. In this particular instance, I think Flitwick is often used in Indy!Harry stories as a non-Dumbledore aligned teacher, and being half-goblin is a good excuse to give him a unique view of the world, especially when wizarding Britain as a whole is being bashed.

Alright who the heck downvoted me? That's literally a legit term for it good lord everyone's absolute snowflakes.

Update: I apologize for my misunderstanding. I think in my mind I swapped the words dwarf with midget, thinking that dwarf was the offensive version due to connections of small, bearded people in mythology and fantasy. I appreciate the people who have informed me of my mistake and corrected me!
