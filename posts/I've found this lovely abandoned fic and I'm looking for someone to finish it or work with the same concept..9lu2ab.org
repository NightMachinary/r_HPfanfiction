Here is the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5371322/1/The-Beast-Master][link]], I'll quickly explain harry's main ability and what makes it so interesting.

Harry has a special gift akin to legilimency that he can use to put "Pieces" of himself inside of animals (Not like Horcruxes!) and can live through the animals and control them and enhance their basic intelligence. and he's a really good survivalist.

I'd ask the original writer but as it hasn't been updated in like 9 years I'm quite sure it's abandoned.


** What's the original?
