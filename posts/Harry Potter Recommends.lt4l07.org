In my desperation to find fics that were both complete and new (to me) I started doing searches all over with just specific keywords and characters, keeping it vague and out of my normal search terms. After a few false starts I came across a real gem.

Linkffn(Harry Potter recommends by swanpride) is a really unusual take on Harry Potter, in which the Dursleys realize they can exploit Harry for his fame and reap the benefits.

CW for child neglect and emotional/verbal/mental abuse, and gaslighting.

My review: Maybe I'm just riding the high of having read a story so unique and free from any of the typical tropes that drive a story straight into the dirt, but I think this one is going in my top five favorite stories so far.

While it is translated from German, the author and translator both did a really bang up job of it. The errors present in the story generally only amounted to a few misspelled things here and there, which is no big deal when a story is going through a translator in my opinion. The author also explains anything that might not make sense because of cultural references or inability to translate something to English (due to that word or phrase just not existing in the English language). They did a great job, I hope I can explore more of their writing soon!

The characters are believably written, and nobody is over the top or romanticized. Most notably, Snape is written amazingly well. He's never not a cantankerous old git, but he's also able to show basic human decency and think for himself in any instances where things don't add up. This is definitely not a Severitus fic, yet Snape still holds to his promise to look after Lily's son. There's also no outward pining over Lily on Snape's behalf, which is refreshing and makes him even more "Snape" than I've seen in most fics. He's bitter, he's annoyed at all of the inconveniences he has to deal with on a daily basis, and he's also not going to do any less than his best on the duties he feels he is obligated to. Even if he's going to make sure not to be pleasant about it. I'm not explaining it very well, so I urge you to read it yourself!

Harry is also very much "Harry Potter". There's no prodigy Harry Potter, no overly emotional Harry, and he's portrayed very much as an average wizarding kid; he is curious, lonely, resigned to what his life is, and naive on many realistic levels. He has his moments of being observant or picking up on the fact that things aren't quite right, but he's also not a total Granger about his hunches. He's a product of his environment, which makes him quite shut off outwardly and I thought that reflected canon Harry very well.

There's an element of manipulative Dumbledore, but it's done in a way I've never seen before, wherein his manipulations backfire on him at the bureaucratic level, without being a slapstick comedy of errors surrounding all of his foul ups. He's literally just a dude who thought he had the upper hand in all ways, and yet was still outmaneuvered.

There's no real bashing, just negative elements of certain characters that are covered but not focused on. The Dursleys are, as ever, absolute bastards.

I highly recommend this fic to anyone looking for something new!


** I remember reading that, and I wish I didn't. Nothing wrong with it, but if I had read the descriptions more thoroughly I think I would have passed.

I hate the thought that people could subject a child to that kind of emotional abuse. I definitely hate any real world parallels. As someone who reads fanfic as a form of escapism, that story felt way too real.

Was quality fanfic, just not my cup of tea at all.

*** Totally understandable! Fanfics are supposed to be something that helps the reader, be it simply for entertainment, for escape, or in some cases, processing real life grief or trauma. I'm not surprised that this story would be upsetting for some.

To be honest I had almost forgotten to put the CW on the front of my review, but after reading your comment I'm glad I didn't forget it.

  Because of a chance meeting in a toy store, the Dursleys get the opportunity to utilise Harry's fame. Whereas they get more and more money to spend, he ends up living as a prisoner in his own house. AU, No Pairings, Translated by DracaDelirus THANK YOU!
