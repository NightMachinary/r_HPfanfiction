The only witness still mentally coherent enough to question, one Ronald Weasley, only had the following to say before the Dreamless Sleep Potion kicked in: "Harry said he wanted to have a good time".


** Harry was drunk, and wanted Fireworks, but Drunk Harry was a hipster. the Weasleys Fireworks, and the Firework Making spell were too mainstream, so he decided to produce it naturally.. So he had Neville attempt the Levitation Charm at the same time as Seamus attempted to make Rum. The problem was, Neville caused explosions even with the simplest of spells, and the Fire and Explosions spread faster than anyone could contain.
