So my brain decided to implode on its self so I'm trying to find this story or series on ao3. The first book is what I'm trying to find. It has mod harry and he is also a werewolf or the alpha lord because he can shift outside the moon. Harry is also paired with Voldemort and I'm pretty sure there are only seven chapters. Thank you if you have read this and considered helping me!


** Stand Against The Moon by Batsutousai ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2378855]]) is definitely what you mean.
