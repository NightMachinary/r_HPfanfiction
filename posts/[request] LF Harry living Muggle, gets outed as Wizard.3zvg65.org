I read a few crossovers, such as with the Avengers were Harry is living mostly Muggle and then gets outed by SHIELD - is there anything NON x-over were he lives in the Muggle world and then get entangled with the Wizards? Either as an adult of his own free will, or also an alternate childhood fic maybe (ran away, living under new name, abroad, on unplottable land etc?).


** Here's one that was recced on TVTropes. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3703793/1/]])
