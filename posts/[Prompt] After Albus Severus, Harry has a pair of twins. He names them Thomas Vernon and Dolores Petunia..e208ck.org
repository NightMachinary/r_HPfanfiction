*** Reminds me of this quote from the seventh horcrux:

#+begin_quote
  She's adorable, Harry. What's her name?"

  "Well, we decided that she needed a grand and terrifying title, much like Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore. So I named her after all of my greatest enemies."

  Ron Weasley, conman and former werewolf, gaped at my brilliance. "You WHAT?"

  Hermione pinched the bridge of her nose. "What did you end up with?"

  "Her name is Severus Albus Lily Luna Lord Voldemort Potter."

  Ginevra smiled. "We call her Sally for short."

I love how this fic manages to capture the ridiculousness of certain canon moments in the funniest way possible.

**** Are you me? I was also going to post that. And this is the reason why I love fic in general because you get these moments that otherwise would have been impossible to experience.

** Harry kneels down, planting those rickety knee caps (that were failing him in these later years) on the pristine and unforgiving flags of Platform 9 3/4's. He placed a gentle hand on the so small shoulder of his youngest, his other hand raising his darling son's face so he could gaze upon him.

He was so much like his mother, the resemblance in his androgynous features nigh-uncanny. Those pretty hazel eyes, the gentle shape of his face, the wispy carrot hair (that only resembled his fathers in it's inability to lay flat) and the soft brown freckles on his cheeks vaguely resembling the constellation his deceased godfather was named for,

"I wanna be in Gryffindor, dad." He whined at his fathers silent question of 'what's wrong?', "I know you said we can ask the Hat, but what if it sends me somewhere else?"

Harry smiled, the running trend, all of his children had this talk with him on their first trip to the castle. It was a routine he adored now, as a small chuckle rippled past his lips,

"Tom Quirinus Potter, I named you after the two men I murked whilst at Hogwarts." His little one flushed and held his gaze with rapt attention whilst a few fellow parents paused and blinked in astonishment at his words, "If you think you're going anywhere other than where you wanna be, you're mistaken."

He waved off his son with a smile, briefly catching a glimpse of his older kids in the windows as the Hogwarts Express breezed away. Next catching a glimpse of their mother... and her new partner. Both sharing a few comments and points in his direction before leaving with rolled eyes.

He didn't care, she was just pathetic. Who divorces their husband over what they name their child? Ridiculous.
