Welcome to Crime Week, on the [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1pps2p/crime_week/][crime week]] submission thread, the story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7108864/1/Memorium][Memorium]] by Aesop, submitted by [[/u/wordhammer]] and upvoted by you, is this weeks story.

I think is is perhaps one of the best stories on the bookclub so far. But what do you guys think?

- The morality and ethics of magic was questioned quite a bit in this short story, what was your take on this? Particularly the use of the memory charms?
- What do you think of the story so far?
- did you drop? if so why?
- Readability? (would you suggest it to others, style, grammar, dialog etc)
- What did you like and why?
- What didnt you like and why?
- Did you drop it, and if you did why did you?
- What could have been better?
- And for those who read it all: The ending?

Lets make this good!


** - I think they need to be more conservative with how they treat 'muggles' and not load them up with 6 figures worth of dope
- It is a pretty good short story.

*** I really didn't like the culture of it, but if they want to keep secrecy how else could they do it?

** It's messed up, but what other alternative do they have if they want to keep the Wizarding world a secret? The Aurors simply need to be trained to minimize the harm to the Muggles they wipe the memory of.

** I always wondered how they drew the line with Muggleborns. I mean, Hermione's parents knew she was a witch. I'm assuming if she had siblings they would have known. Would her grandparents have known? Other extended family? What's to keep them from letting something slip? The Ministry could not possibly keep track of all the relatives of all the Muggleborns and anyone they might talk to about where their kid was going to school or whatever. I liked the story, though.
