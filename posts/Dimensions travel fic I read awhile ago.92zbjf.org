Looking for a fanfic where A war torn Harry some how appears in a spectacular manner In the forests of Potter manner in I think a Column of fire or at least causes quite a bit of distraction where he arrives. James some others go out and find him. Now it's something like James and Lily are alive and have a couple other kids I think they're all Girls and either There's a girl who lived version of him or it's just a sister. The oldest likes to take brooms out at night to practice in hopes of playing quidditch I think and one night harry is watching when she falls and he saves her. I think that's where the fic was left last time I read it anyways, sorry for the long post but really hoping to find this one I've been through a lot of the ff.net community's that are all about alternate universe travel and haven't found it yet.


** EDIT: bot linked the wrong one. The fic is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12188248/1/Dead-Man-Walking][dead man walking]]

  The Kyuubi Chakra was split into two halves and sealed into Naruto's sisters, the Yang into Erza, and the Yin into Mito. But there was another being there that night, and three possible hosts. Minato was able to survive the sealing by changing the seal at the last minute, not realizing his mistake until years later. First six chapters adopted from Jinx777.
