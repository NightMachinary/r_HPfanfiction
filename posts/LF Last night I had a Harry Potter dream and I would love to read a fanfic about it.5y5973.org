In my dream, Harry left the Durlseys not long before his 11th Birthday. He started living on the streets, doing it tough and over time became wild and kinda crazy. No one heard from him again til he was at least 16. He also /had/ a cat. (Edit:Not was one)

Anyone read/recommend a fanfic that follows that line? I woke up feeling very sad and eager to follow that kind of story


** Maybe you can try linkffn(Fantastic Elves and where to find them)

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5199602/1/The-Thief-of-Hogwarts]])

Harry is a cat, he doesn't leave the Dursleys officially until later in the story but there isn't much time spent there.

Edit: I can only seem to get the bot to work half the time.

The story summary is "Young Harry learns to steal as he is fed up from his deprivation of his wants and needs by his guardians. A Thief is born in Privet Drive."

** There is a story that sounds like what you asked but I can't remember the name of it, I thought it was called green eyes, but google tells me i'm wrong. Maybe someone else knows it? From what I remember he spent the day with Figg then after getting back to the Dursleys he wished he was a cat. One of the male Kneazles found him and took him to the mother and other kittens. He essentially grew up as a cat. Ginny was a main character, and Harry did turn human to go to hogwarts.

  Running away from the Dursleys at a young age was a turning point of his destiny. Now he lives alone in the wilderness of a land long forgotten by the passage of time. And this is the story of his discovery in the lost world beneath. Slow updates, sorry.
