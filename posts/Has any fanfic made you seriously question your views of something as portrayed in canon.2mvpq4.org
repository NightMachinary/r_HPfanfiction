For example, I'm a lot more ambiguous towards the One Big Happy Weasley Family than I was when I was first reading the books, after certain fanfics pointed out that Hermione as a Weasley doesn't any longer have to worry about being badly-received or looked down upon due to her Muggle surname Granger. Call me cynical...

Also, when I first read the epilogue I thought Harry's kids names were cute, but since that time fanfic has really pointed out to me that effectively Ginny had no hand in naming her own children (The Golden Age by Arsinoe-de-Blassenville, author of The Best Revenge, in particular made this clear).

What's changed your mind? Or made you look twice at canon.

EDIT: I'm not looking for particular fics. Just curious about people's views of canon that might've changed after having read fanfic. I'm assuming people read the original books (or some of them) before finding fanfics of the series.

** Fanfiction was what made me really start looking deeper into Dumbledore's character and actions (or inaction). It gave a new perspective on canon, and though you have to keep fan works separate, simply looking at canon from a different angle or point of view gives a really different reality than what's painted in the books. I used to respect his character, now I hate his character. I can respect some of the beliefs and some of the actions credited to him, but not the character.

***** In the context of OP's question: aka changed viewpoints after having read fanfics (OP wanted specific fics but my brain is refusing to respond to requests for fic names atm)

--------------

After having just read the original series:

I wake up in the Potterverse... I'd have immediately booked it to Hogwarts and started rattling off anything and everything I could think of about what was coming to Dumbledore.

--------------

After having read way too many Manipulative!Dumbledore fics:

I'd be worried about waking up the next day obliviated of my future knowledge.

Ironically I'm self aware enough to recognize that I'd probably end up playing my cards very close to my chest, committing all the sins I'd accuse Dumbledore of committing regarding secrecy until I felt much more confident that I wasn't in a fanon universe.

--------------

Even in canon tho, in retrospect he had a variety of conflicts of interest between being headmaster and being the leader against Voldemort. Even still... my comment was meant to be less about blaming Dumbledore and more about not wanting to be one of the pieces sacrificed in the name of defeating Tom.

******* I also would distrust Dumbledore, but I will admit at least in some cases I might be looking for things that aren't there simply because there is so much we /don't know/ about the canon universe. Really, this might be the biggest reason that Harry Potter is such a popular setting in fan fiction. Obviously the popularity of the story itself helps, but we essentially have an interesting world with tons of characters and most of it really isn't explored at all. I mean, I think the total information we get about Daphne Greengrass, for example, is that she's a girl in Harry's year, a Slytherin and has a younger sister named Astoria. That's it, but this dearth of information doesn't stop plenty of stories containing for featuring her. Frustrating for one interested in the world, but great for a writer who outside of the given info, has a free character to take in pretty much any direction they want.

To use an example Halloween 1981 and how exactly fidelus charms work. The question I come to is: why did the secret keeper have to be Sirius, Remus or Peter? Why not James or Lily, or in fact Dumbledore himself? At the point where Dumbledore is able to get Hagrid to Godric's Hollow faster than pretty much everyone, it's clear that he at the very least knows the secret (or monitors the location to the point he might as well) The only logical explanation I can come up with is that perhaps the magic would prevent the Secret Keeper from actually residing in the building except Dumbledore himself goes in and out of Grimmauld Place all the time for order meetings. I mean, one could say there might of been improvements to the charm in that time span, but at that point one could imply that /anything/ not specifically happened in order to prove their point. Kind of defeats the purpose of this. Also, one wonders about the protections around Neville Longbottom, penetrated a day later. Surely, as the other child of prophecy, he would be just as heavily protected and just as much a concern for the leader against Voldemort. Yet not only do the fall the next day, but we never hear how "X, the Longbottom secret keeper, betrayed them, just like Sirius betrayed the Potters". Anyway, the way I see it one can look at this one of two ways: 1. a tragic mistake by Dumbledore, with terrible consequences, but ultimately a mistake or 2. a deliberate sacrifice for the greater good, to let Voldemort mark one of the children as an equal. A sacrifice of two folks that, at the very least, nominally worked with/under Dumbledore since they are members of the Order of the Phoenix. Really one could say that about many of Dumbledore's actions but if they are all mistakes, he's not just too incompetent for any of his positions, he's too incompetent for daily function.

Not to be glib, but off the top of my head, there's: not only not checking on a kid, much less the savior of the world, for 10 years but once finding out about his home life, not only not helping fix any issues the boy develops (shit, as much as Harry sees Pomfrey, not one mention of malnutrition or fixing it?), but /sending him back without changes made to the situation/, bringing an item that's perfect Voldemort bait /to a school full of children/ (hell, Nicholas Flamel and his wife are two folks dead due to Dumbledore's action, the only reason they destroy it is that they are afraid Voldemort will get the bait Dumbledore set out), putting what amounts to a carnival ride of defenses in front of it that 11 year olds bypass (hey, lets put a defense that requires a potion to pass through, then give them the potion, and set of instructions to show which one it is!) much less a set of of defenses perfectly fitting one specific group of kids (even including Neville if he happened to come), when confronted with a troll that was found in the dungeon, sending Slytherins to the dungeons and Hufflepuffs to the basement (which presumably isn't far away), putting a dangerous artifact that would fit perfectly in ancient myth, which Dumbledore himself told Harry drove people insane where kids can accidentally drop in on it, and the unlikely, to me, possibility that the vaunted Hogwarts wards or whatever other magical security system Dumbledore has can't detect something as in-canon vile as the malevolent spirit of Voldemort himself or later a horcrux entering the building. And this is just first year.

There are other less terrible oddities like hiring Filch (though really him and Snape should not be around children, or at the very least Snape should teach nothing less than pre-mastery level classes) and having broom closets when Hogwarts employs house elves, his blatant manipulation of the points system, or the things that a Hogwarts education lacks, like a basic math class, a Health/Sex Ed. class, or any physical activity outside of Quidditch (which only a small group participates in and is still a sport would really only work the core and one's dominant arm) [I understand from a story perspective why Rowling might want to avoid say Sex Ed., but a health class that examines biological differences between magicals and non-magicals, or pure-blood/not pure-blood, I'd read that.]

Again, I might be looking for things that aren't there, but this speaks of someone who needs to be in permanent care, not the headmaster of a school, head of Wizengamont, leader of the magical UN (and presumably Britain's representative) and militia group leader into one. Which leads into all those manipulative Dumbledore fics, which gives reasons for is actions, just not light/good ones

/for what it's worth, I'm like ruljinn as far as views of canon being changed by fan fiction\\

#+end_quote

Rowling was writing for children. You tend not to kill off characters in a children's story. That said, people did start dying before the end of the series. Since Dumbledore was the first, it's a lot harder to attribute subsequent deaths to him.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore believed strongly in the prophecy and therefore acted passively and steered Harry towards a path to defeat Voldemort.
#+end_quote

Dumbledore believed in an interpretation of the prophecy that contradicted the text of the prophecy. "Either must die at the hands of the other" -- one must kill the other, we're not saying which will happen; "neither can live while the other survives" -- that would indicate that Voldemort wouldn't be able to return to his body until Harry died, and that Voldemort's safety would be more secure once Harry was dead.

Dumbledore's version of the prophecy: Voldemort must kill Harry so Voldemort becomes mortal again, and then Harry will kill him. That corresponds with a prophecy that reads "Each must die at the hands of the other, for neither can perish while the other survives." But that would result in Voldemort not trying to kill Harry and instead trying to dose him with the Draught of the Living Death and secure him in some hidden location.

With the real prophecy, Dumbledore should have been protecting Harry by whatever means necessary. Have Alastor Moody train him in magic at some remote location. Maybe the middle of the Himalayas; maybe an underground or underwater lair accessible only by portkey or apparition. As long as Harry was alive, Voldemort couldn't be resurrected. In the meantime, he should be securing all the horcruxes and bringing them to Harry to destroy.

But Dumbledore was an extension of the author's will rather than a sensible character, so his blatant stupidity did not in fact doom everyone but instead made everything come up roses.

If I woke up in the Potterverse I'd put Moody to shame in the paranoia department until I settled in and was able to confirm details. About the only person I'd consider trusting in general is Harry... because let's face it, if he's evil then its already game over.

** The first fanfic I read was A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles.

Up to that point, I liked Harry Potter, but it wasn't even in my top 20 literary favorites. When reading that, my memory kicked in, and I started piecing together all kinds of things about the books. Luna's way of coping with an /eccentric/ father and a mother that died (in an accident... or did she kill herself?) in front of her was a combination of creating her own magical world where she could be powerfully optimistic about it all. Snape may have been a bastard, but he was a broken man, and probably had been a broken child before that. Sirius was mentally unstable post-Azkaban, and stuck to a childish world view to keep from falling apart in order to be there for Harry.

From there, it just snowballed. Questions popped up everywhere. Was Tonks really clumsy or did she just play it up? Because if she was really clumsy, how could she get an O in potions and then pass training under Moody? How much of Dumbledore's actions towards Snape were based on self-loathing?

I reread the books. All of a sudden, how much of Snape's wrath towards Neville was because of Neville's social awkwardness reminding him of himself? Harry was kind of a brat and never tried to be respectful to Snape even after learning from Quirrelmort that Snape had been protecting him... how much of the Snape/Harry animosity could have been avoided had Dumbledore not lied and said that Snape hated James because James saved his life? Did Dumbledore do that understanding that Harry would just see Snape as some form of weirdo rather than someone who worked to keep him safe?

All it took was one great fanfic, and my views of the Harry Potter series changed from "meh, it was rather good... but Harry is just a boring Ender" to "there is a helluvalot going on here".

** Yes but ultimately (or the nail in the coffin) was Rowling herself when she posted this:

Albus Dumbledore's plans, however, ran deep. He happened to have known two of the wizards for whose life's work Gilderoy Lockhart had taken credit, and was one of the only people in the world who thought he knew what Lockhart was up to. Dumbledore was convinced that Lockhart needed only to be put back into an ordinary school setting to be revealed as a charlatan and a fraud. Professor McGonagall, who had never liked Lockhart, asked Dumbledore what he thought students would learn from such a vain, celebrity-hungry man. Dumbledore replied that ‘there is plenty to be learned even from a bad teacher: what not to do, how not to be'.

Before this I felt (and still do to an extent) that 'oh they're kids books' and while there are plot holes and issues you have to take in the spirit it was given.

In the light of the above however Dumbledore apparently thinks it's a good idea to hire a wizard who is known to be a skilled, and immoral, obliviator. I mean I know it's a kids book but ALL the girls fawned over him and there isn't any concern over taking advantage and obliviating? Besides that, and I know the position has been cursed for decades, hiring a known incompetent fraud for a whole year seems very stupid. Any lessons that can learned from a bad teacher/person can be learned inside a class or two or maybe a week; not a whole freaking year. "they had never had a practical DADA class before" (PoA) and other remarks sure seem like that plan is a black mark against Dumbledore.

So where I used think yes leaving a baby on the front porch at night is technically illegal and dumb but its a kids story book! yes those safety measures clearly weren't up to snuff but it makes it interesting for each of the kids, and ok you hired the dark lord (I hope and assume he didn't know but he knowingly hired Lockhart) and a death eater (granted it was a well pulled of switch that fooled him but safety measures! its a school! and you know BWL/LV thing?) and a nefariously skilled mind alterer (on purpose...) and a werewolf (favourite character but as we saw the 1% chance of danger isn't worth the risk - perhaps not surprising given the curse on the DADA position) and a whole host of other things that I use to roll my eyes at people who pointed this stuff out as it's 'just a story, a kids book, magic n stuff' now I just don't know.

There are surely other Grangers that have passed through Hogwarts that aren't related to her. (In fact, I believe there was one Slughorn mentioned in /HBP/ that was a famous potionmaster; he asked Hermione if they were related.)

Besides, there's explicit evidence in the books that people don't recognize Muggle-borns by their surname alone. Blood supremacists have to /ask/ people about their parentage to find out. That's what Draco did. That's presumably what Voldemort's followers did in the early days.

The only thing your name gets you is recognition if it's /already/ famous for being linked to a powerful pureblood family (or you're a Weasley). Which is exactly how it works in the real world (e.g., Kennedy, Roosevelt, Windsor, etc.).

I don't trust Rowling's numbers, but let's run with it. 40 students in the 1991 sorting, 1000 students total. Draco will primarily be dealing with students in the 1991 sorting, so he would have been drilled on those families. Even if 35 of them were pureblood, he could easily memorize that many families and another ten dozen.

Now let's look at class sizes. 160 students per year before 1991, and most classes are two houses. That's 80 students per class on average -- doable for lectures, but there's a lot of practical work involved. Snape must be relieved to deal with Harry's class; he's barely able to contain the disasters sometimes with only twenty students to worry about. Unless there are really an extra couple dozen instructors and each instructor follows a particular cohort, but now we're getting far into conjecture.

Also possibly classes are taught by older students or 'teaching assistants' who don't sit at the teachers' table. That would preserve Rowling's numbers and the canon table.

And if you think for a second there weren't people named after war heros or people viewed as largely responsible for ending wars, you've got some reading to do. And add on the fact that these were people Harry personally knew and respected, better than almost anyone else (in the sense that Harry knew them better than most), and it makes perfect sense for him to name his kid after them.

And it's not like Albus isn't going to go to school with a bunch of Harry's anyway.

No one's gonna give them shit for being named after war heros his parents personally knew. And the names aren't even weird in wizarding culture, so that's not an issue either.

*** This!

It would be much more logical that the magical nations, or at least the authority of certain ministries, would have similar borders as they were in 1689 when the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy was decided.

Seeing that power is something nobody gives up voluntarily I don't see the wizards giving up territory/authority because the muggles gave them up.

[[http://www.euratlas.net/history/europe/1700/1700.jpg][This is Europe at the time when the Statute was set in place]]. Wizard wars and muggle events that we know (or suspect) about having effect on the wizard society (like WW1 and 2) would alter these borders, of course. But smaller wars, alliances,... made in the muggle world wouldn't alter the wizard world. And wizard wars having the same territorial outcome is highly unlikely.

So where is the Ottoman Empire, where is Habsburg, where is the Church State,...? Clearly the books weren't targeted at people who cared about these things, but it bothers me now that I have an understanding of politics and the nature of wars.

That map makes me cringe.

There was no nation called "Habsburg". There was Austria and there was Hungary, and they were in a personal union under the von Habsburg dynasty. The von Habsburgs were everywhere.

Poland and Lithuania were also in a personal union, typically called the Commonwealth. Saxony was an independent nation whose rulers were of the Wettin dynasty, a lesser branch of the family, while another branch of that family held the throne of the Commonwealth. Wettins currently rule Great Britain and Belgium.

I'm not sure where "Scotland-England-Netherlands" comes from. Scotland and England were not in a personal union until the mid 1700s (a personal union that persists to today). The Netherlands were invaded and temporarily controlled by Spain, but never by England.

Norway isn't labeled separately from Denmark -- moderately understandable since Norway's a lesser partner in a personal union at the time. But they label other personal unions.

Is this map an attempt to map out dynasties as of 1700? But then they shouldn't have labeled the Netherlands at all; they were a republic at the time. And then they would have called both the Commonwealth and Saxony "Wettin".

*** I see it as a misunderstanding more than anything.

There is a Minister for Magic for every country in the world, because every government needs to be monitored in order to maintain the Statute of Secrecy and ensure that despotic regimes aren't actually puppets of dark wizards.

Some of those Ministers are elected representatives responsible for their own shadow government, whilst others have an office run out of their home, their entire enforcement squad consisting of friends and relatives. The Minister for Liechtenstein, for example, is selected on the basis of which one finds the coin in the treacle at the Yule feast.

**** Sure, every muggle nation with any significant wizard presence must be covered. But there's no reason for there to be a one-to-one correspondence. For instance, we might reasonably have a separate magical government for Wales and another for Cornwall, with the two of them working with the unified British and Scottish magical government to oversee muggle Great Britain. Alternatively, we might have a magical Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth that oversees the muggle governments of Poland, Lithuania, and Bulgaria.

That situation would predict a "Bulgarian Minister for Magic" but not "a representative from the Bulgarian Ministry". The former would be a Commonwealth official in charge of obliviation and secrecy in the duchy of Bulgaria -- important to be sure, but not a head of government or even diplomatically relevant. The latter would indicate that wizarding Bulgaria were attempting to secede from the Commonwealth and the British Ministry was officially recognizing them as an independent nation.

Moreover, why must the names be the same? In an alternate history, Epirus rebelled against the Ottomans, seized some northern territories, then lost their Greek holdings to the resurgent Byzantium, and now the region corresponding to muggle Bulgaria is known as Βόρεια Ήπειρος -- North Epirus.

I totally understand why Rowling didn't write it that way -- she was writing for a young audience and didn't want to bog it down with complex historical politics that have little to no bearing on the plot. It offends my sensibilities, though.

As the Ministry of Magic rebuilds itself, everyone finds out that the hostile takeover of everything they loved has already happened, and if they don't support it their entire economy will collapse.

Guest appearances by the Ghost of Severus Snape who spends the entire time laughing his ass off at everyone's stupidity, Draco Malfoy who finds out that being rich by wizard standards is nothing to an ex-HSBC employee with an axe to grind, and Hermione Granger who can't help but think that for moments like these she really should have learned more math and less spells and ends up going to Oxford in a fit of studiousness.

** The fact that every single wizard is completely stupid in canon?

Despite me knowing that Rowling utilized the books not as a "fantastical" story, but rather used the fantasy as an outlet to portray in different ways the characters and themes she wanted us to feel and understand, she under-played human intelligence by a lot.

The only true and smart plot during the whole harry potter books was the chamber of secrets, where voldemort was a second away from winning the war before ever even starting it.

Dumbledore, throughout the whole books, despite being shown in a wise and powerful persona, he commited so many stupid and common-sensical mistakes: -Letting Cornelius Fudge as minister of magic, when he as dumbledore had more political power than anyone else combined. He could have gotten Lucius "disappeared" if he so wanted to. I mean, being hogwarts headmaster, Grindelwalds vanquisher, supreme mugwump, and all those other titles had him the most powerful wizard in all of britain, and you are telling me he couldn't control the daily prophet? And sure, you could argue that he truly believed in good and wanted everyone to be redeemed (except vodlemort), but in the face of war, by that moment you honestly don't care about morality. And here we face another hypocresy from him letting a teenager who has no knowledge whatsoever of how the world works, who has been badly abused for pretty much his whole life be the leading figure against the most powerful dark wizard of all time? (more on that later) and he wouldn't kill all of the known deatheaters who escaped azkaban? He could fight voldemort to a standstill! Also, we don't really know what an unbreakable vow entails within magic except that if you break it you die, but wouldn't that be the OBVIOUS solution to never having a teacher abusing or hurting a student? (especially considering how J.K. Rowling pulled that vow out of her ass, with only one or two special conditions for it) And voldemort was completely useless! He already had the government in his pocket thanks to lucius, he had the whole country terrorized except for like 50 people versus his army of pretty much everyone else, and he had to go for dramatics, wanting to kill a stupid teenager boy, when he already had control of pretty much everywhere. Who cares about Harry Potter when you already have brittain? Sure, he is the country's "hope" and keeps the "resistance" going, but how long can a group of a few hundred undertrained children, and a handful of adults outlast thousands of dark creatures and death eaters? Dumbledore was already dead! and Voldemort fought the most powerful british wizards in a duel by himself and would have killed them if not for the deus ex machina appearence of Harry Potter, who clearly was more important that the other 4 scholars who were the best at their subjects.

And honestly, voldemort never even thought of transfiguring the fucking air into cyanide or something?¡

I like the Harry Potter books for what they represent, which is a teenager angst story, about life, morality, choices, love, redemption, angst, angst, angst. Which is something that makes them unique.
