To protect Harry, Albus cast a Fidelius with the help of Augusta Longbottom. "Harry Potter is the wizard who is known as the boy who defeated Voldemort."

Harry grows up alongside Neville and nobody knows that he's the boy who lived. Everyone believes him to be the son of a witch whom Frank and Alice took in after the witch was murdered in the war for being muggleborn. Harry isn't told much about the Potters except that they were great friends of the Longbottoms and that they died in the war.

Dumbledore kept the parentage of Harry a secret because he figured if Voldemort were to piece together why he attacked the Potters, he could deem the boy dangerous. Whereas the son of a muggleborn, which is a lie hidden in truth, is much less of a threat.

Bellatrix never went after the Longbottoms. She instead decided the best way to protect her lord was to cast a Fidelius herself, with her sister Narcissa as the secret keeper. "Tom Riddle is the wizard known as Voldemort."

With that secret concealed, Dumbledore would be left without an idea on how Voldemort is immortal, since Tom's obsession with the dark arts is irrelevant to him.

With Harry's secret concealed, Voldemort is unaware of who killed him on Halloween 1981.

Voldemort also is unaware of his past self. After he is resurrected, he believes the loss of personality is the result of being a wraith.


** That's an interesting idea. I don't think there are any canon examples of the Fidelius Charm being used this way. To hide a concept instead of a physical object or person. I like it but it makes me wonder about abuses of the power. Could you hide Hogwarts this way? What about the concept of magic from the muggles? Could you hide the Moon?

*** This prompt is definitely interesting. The first question that came to mind was, "Could the prophecy have been hidden this way, preventing all these events from happening?"

I wonder how the prophecy could be fulfilled in the scenario that the OP gave.

Moving to another topic, this reminds me of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10974880/1/][Harry Potter and the Fractured Apocalypse,]] a story where the Fidelius played a huge part in shaping the mysterious world that Harry now has to explore.

*** My take is always that the "Secret" has to be /yours/. Which is why the Potters couldn't be their own Secret Keepers. They had to pass their Secret to someone else, as Flitwick describes. Shell Cottage was probably owned by that Weasley aunt, whatever her name is. The bitch.

Dumbledore knowing voldemort would be back and since he belives sirius sold the potters out

he created a modifed version where you could both be the secret and the keeper

****** I reason it was because they couldn't leave their house, and to keep communication open, at least someone outside would need to be able to pass the secret on. Like if everyone who knows of your location is murdered, how do you know the war is over.

*** Yeah, I don't think the Fidelius can hide abstract concepts- if it could, the magical world would probably have something like the SCP Foundation's [[http://www.scpwiki.com/antimemetics-division-hub][Antimemetics Division]].

I guess it could still be possible to make a spell like that, but since we don't see any unspeakables researching "self-hiding" concepts, that would imply something like [[https://www.reddit.com/r/SCPDeclassified/comments/6cgkiv/scp3125_the_escapee/][SCP 3125]] is eating anyone who tries to do so. If that were the case, the wizarding world would have much bigger problems than Voldemort.

Now that I think about it, that would be an interesting crossover- Luna Lovegood sees things that nobody else can even find evidence for. In the crossover, Nargles would be [[http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-2256][antimemetic creatures]] , the Lovegoods somehow have an immunity to antimemes, and Luna's mother would have died because she got eaten by SCP 3125.

EDIT:

According to [[/u/ranharpaz][u/ranharpaz]] and Pottermore, the Fidelius can hide abstract concepts. The wording says that it's used to hide a secret, so maybe it's just really hard to cast the Fidelius on something a lot of people know about.

*** How do we know Hogwarts isn't hidden this way? What if the invitation letters are actually all just being let in on the secret? Although this might make the triwizard tournament harder I can imagine Acceptance letters going out from Dumbledore which would allow them entry...

I mean it's not thought to be but then what's the best way of keeping it intact would be for people not to know about it I guess.

** My headcanon on the fidelius is, that it only works on secrets. So you can only use it on things, if everyone who know about it participates in the spell. For example Grimaulds could go under fidelius cause everyone who lifed there and knew where it was besides Sirius was dead (and the Black sisters might have never visited to begin with). Also house elfes naturally dont count. As for the Potter House we simply dont know much about it, other than that the Potters hid there - so before it was cast pobably only some ppl knew about it and even less knew that the potters lived there. On the other hand the existance of the moon is wildy known so its no secret to hide to begin with.

That way the fidelius isnt overpowered and it makes sense that it isnt used much.

For your prompt this would of course pose a problem. Because than neither dumbledore nor bella could cast the spell without LV and both would know that hes still around.

** I really do like this. I reread the definition of the fidelius a while ago, and rediscovered the fact that it's a spell used to hide a secret, not necessarily a location.

Of course, that does come into conflict with the fact that the fidelius, in protecting the secret that "The HQ of the Order of the Phoenix (is at) Number 12 Grimmauld Place", hid the entire location, not just the idea of who is in there.

** I love the idea and I would certainly be intrigued enough to want to read the fic because this means Harry Potter and Voldemort must find each other again as their nemesis through a completely different reasons than just the prophecy.

Also: both Harry Potter and Tom Riddle won't know their own identity anymore. How does an angry dark lord and a self exploring teenager deal with that stuff?

Minor comment on the idea though: I cannot see Bellatrix trusting anyone enough with Voldemort's identity but herself. She'd probably force her sister to preform the spell and become the secret keeper in stead, and then do something completely outrageous to make sure nobody will ever make her confess that ever. Like cutting out her own tongue so she can't answer with veritaserum, or following up with an unbreakable vow of never even trying to confess Voldemort's identity to anyone but Voldemort himself so she would die before she'd say the truth. Because she is a certified lunatic.
