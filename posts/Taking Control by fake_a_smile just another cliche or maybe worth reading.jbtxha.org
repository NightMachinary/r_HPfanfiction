*Ok before I start, this is my first time ever posting on this sub (or reddit period), don't bash me too hard please???*

TL;DR: Skip to the last paragraph

Ok so the fic I'm talking about in this post is linkffn(2954601). And after I read it I was surprised I didn't see it recommended more often, but where it is linked there's lots of mixed feelings so here we go...

(if you want to decide whether to read it or not before seeing spoilers + discussion then the sparknotes version of what I'm about to say is that it is definitely Indy!Harry, BUT I think it's close to what the Indy!Harry fanfic genre /could/ have been, or maybe was before it turned into the Lord Hadrian Perfection of the Southern Everything. sadly the sequel is unfinished but it's still good I think)

SPOILERS START HERE

Ok so yes, this fic does check a lot of the typical Indy!Harry boxes: shopping trip, trunk, Dumbledore-bashing, Ron + Hermione-bashing, wandless magic, 2 Animagus forms, metamorphmagus... not a good start for defending the fic, I know. But the thing about all of these, for the abilities side of it, *every one* of those extra abilities is ACTUALLY used---not once or twice, I mean /really/ used.

Take the trunk: yea, it has a living space, and multiple compartments, but this particular argument is something I don't truly understand---for Harry, someone who never really had a home of his own (before he gets one at least), why wouldn't he want a space that was really just /his/? And the author doesn't try and give him a Mansion-in-a-Box or anything, it's basically a small apartment with some bare necessities, and we see him using it in his office for privacy. Him buying the actual house at the end does make it kind of obsolete, but when he buys it you do get the feeling that it was never supposed to be a permanent thing---again, it was just supposed to be so that /Harry/ could feel that he had a space for his own until he actually found somewhere.

The same argument goes for the shopping trip---why wouldn't he want to have his own stuff now that he finally /can/? And the author doesn't spend five chapters on it, doesn't make it one monster-sized chapter, and makes it a (to me) somewhat believable shopping experience, without Harry suddenly becoming a goth, androgynous (not that I have any problem with any of these styles, I just don't see them on canon-ish Harry), an e boy, or anything other than a slightly clueless teenage boy. Also I happen to love Jessica, both because she's part of the author making it clear that Harry/Ginny, while endgame, is not something that instantly happens now that Harry's different, but also that I think he writes a believable long-distance friendship between two people who aren't the same gender.

The wandless magic---this, to me, seems like something a little less controversial than the shopping and the trunk tropes, actually. I like the way it's handled here, with Harry being powerful enough for it to come naturally, but with it still being clear that his actual skill/practice/spell repertoire/technique isn't NEAR Voldemort's, or even Dumbledore's (though this comes out more in the unfinished sequel), and the fact that it can be used by other people. And it's kind of vital for him to be able to actually fight the Death Eaters (side note: why did it feel like he lost all motivation to do literally anything at all for the war in HBP besides lessons with Dumbledore where he didn't actually *do* much? /sighhhh/---best left for another discussion tho). Fighting the Death Eaters could have happened in other ways, like Sirius knowing a way to remove the trace, but I feel like Dumbledore would have noticed or something. I liked this part.

The animagus forms are basically the same reasoning---they were USED. Harry used both of them, and I /loved/ the focus on Hedwig and talking to her.

The bashings --- this was Dumbledore, Ron, and Hermione. So, my thoughts on Dumbledore was that the author definitely over-bashed him in the beginning, but figured out how to tone it down, at least imo. With Ron, its the same thing, but instead of needing time to figure out what the /right/ level of bashing is, the author needed to make the point that Ron and Harry were still friends between the fights, its just that we the readers saw the fights more than the friendship because those were the interesting bits. Hermione, however, I will admit could have been better. But even this I felt wasn't because what she was doing was unrealistic for her---it was that her dialogue (again, especially at the beginning) was overdramatic. This was probably the most problematic element of the story.

So, wrapping it up, I can't deny that there are lots of the classic Indy!Harry elements---BUT this is as good of a story as you're going to get while still having these elements, so like I said in the beginning, this is what the Indy!Harry genre could have been.

Counterarguments?
