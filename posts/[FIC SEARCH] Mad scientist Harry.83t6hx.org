Hi! I'm looking for a fic I read ages ago but forgot the name of about a Harry that combines Muggle science with magic, it's almost a crack fic. I remember it was Harry/Tonks and Harry injected himself with acromantula DNA to improve himself. If anyone knows the fic I'm talking about that would be awesome. Cheers.

  Harry Potter wasn't raised like in canon. He was top of his class, and very intelligent, always seeking to improve things, and so he learned all kinds of things, and, upon entering Hogwarts, started studying all he could get his hands on! Intelligent!Super!Harry Later Mad Scientist!Harry Rated M for Language, Nudity, and Gore Stein-ish Harry Genres: Humor/Romance/slight Horror
