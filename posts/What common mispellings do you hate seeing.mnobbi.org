** Your, you're. There, their and they're. So many even in generally well written fics.

** If we're limiting ourselves to characters then:

Mafloy (Malfoy)\\
Ginerva (Gonevra)\\
Luscious (Lucius)\\
Pavarti (Parvati)

And some idiots misspell Harry as "Hadrian" or "Harold", ffs.

** /McGonnagal/ and other variations. Sometimes I can't quite put my finger on /what/ is wrong but I just /know/ when I see it.

** Delores instead of Dolores if we're talking character names.

But just general mistakes? Yes, the whole it's/its, you're/your, they're/their/there, we're/were/where set. Misplaced apostrophes generally.

Reign instead of rein. Phase instead of faze. Diffuse instead of defuse. Peak/peek instead of pique. Loose/lose confusion.

And then, as a Brit, there are the Americanisms that jar. Step foot instead of set foot. Shined instead of shone. Drug instead of dragged.

Just off the top of my head. I'm sure I'll find more in the next story I read.

*** For Americanisms, Mom instead of Mum is the one that really stands out for me. I mean, it's pretty common knowledge that it's spelt Mum in the UK so it suggests to me that the author just can't be arsed.

**** You're right about that, and I suppose the ones I mentioned are not as well known so should be excused.

I've just remembered another one that bugged me recently, icebox instead of fridge. But do Americans still use icebox?

Oh, and Collin instead of Colin.

**** Oh really? I never thought about why it's spelled one way or the other in that case. Getting clear British or American English right is kind of difficult if English is your second language and you only read random stuff on the internet. I didn't know that there were different versions with the examples above and would've just used what felt right. Sometimes that might be American, sometimes British English. Now I feel sorry for those of my reader that care about such things :D

***** I have every sympathy and admiration for someone who writes in English when it's not their first language. It's bad enough learning the differences and peculiarities when it is your first language!

And American English is really another language when you think about the different spelling conventions, different names for the same thing, etc.

** I'm personally really chill with all kinds of misspellings BUT... the thing with villain and villian just fucks with my brain every time I see it.

Fortunately, it's only a big “trend” on Wattpad to put villian into the title and villain into tags and the other way around.
