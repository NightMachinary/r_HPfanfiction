It tilts me so much that every malfoy is slytherin, weasley griff, etc. I'd like to see a fic where the sorting hat actually accurately sorts everyone (and not just mc like if Ron or ginny is slytherin and that's it)


** The way I see it, it doesn't sort on personality and traits that one has in the first place but rather on values and traits that one wants or admires, plus an element of personal preference. For example, what Hermione had would make her a perfect Ravenclaw, but what she valued and wanted (Change the World, whether the world wants it or not.) is a Gryffindor value.

Taken together, personalities and traits that are at least somewhat hereditary and the values learned during the student's upbringing would certainly make houses run in the family very much.

*** Change the world sounds slytherin, I'm pretty sure the hat would just suggest the house which suited your personality, most 11 yos would meekly accept whatever came out, but if you wanted (malfoy, Ron, Harry, herms etc) it would just put you wherever you wanted.

**** The only way in which a Slytherin would want to change the world is to put themselves and those they consider their own on top. (E.g., Voldemort, the Malfoys.) A Gryffindor, on the other hand, wants to change the world for what they see as a greater good, even if they have to sacrifice to do it. (E.g., Dumbledore, Hermione.)

IIRC Neville wanted to go to Hufflepuff. Anyway, my headcanon:

​

‘Not Slytherin, eh?' said the small voice. ‘Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it's all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that.'

‘No doubt?' Harry thought back.

‘Well, it could all go horribly wrong, but they made me to be optimistic and to focus on the positives of each House, so I can't really talk about that. Like, say, that one earlier whose hair could barely fit in me---I could've told her that no one in Gryffindor would like her, but I couldn't, you see? Just like I can't tell you whether one or more of your dormmates might resent you for your role in their parents' boss's demise enough to try something. Honestly, if I were sorting based on what could go wrong, Hufflepuff wouldn't be the biggest House; it would be the only House. So, yeah, Slytherin will definitely help you there, if you can survive it.'

‘Can I survive it?'

‘I'm a Thinking cap, not a Seeing cap.'

** It's not quite the same, but there's a scrambled sorting in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12999698/11/Scribble-Pad][White Squirrel's Scribble Pad, Chapter 11]].

...Imagine a fic where the Sorting Hat does in fact sort students to other schools?

  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.

** Personality types often run in families, and if you take the sorting as a kind of psychometric personality test, you'd find that houses do.

It's funny, though, that I'm the only Ravenclaw in my household according to the Pottermore test. My parents are both Gryffindors and my brother's a Slytherin. I think my cousin's daughter might be a Ravenclaw too, but I can't remember with certainty.

** Reality though, is that personality is highly heritable. [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25961374][This]] study estimates that the genetic component is 40%. The abstract mentions that actual twin studies indicate a higher genetic component of 47%.

So individual personality traits aren't as heritable as height, but since there are a bunch of different ones you're going to share going to share something like 47% of your personality traits with your parents even if you've never met them and have grown up with other people. People who actually grow up with their parents are going to have share more personality traits.
