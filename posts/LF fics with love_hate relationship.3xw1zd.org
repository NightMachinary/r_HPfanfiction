I read a lot of fluffy fics the last weeks and need something new, so I ask you for your best love/hate- fics you now. Pairing doesn't matter, but I would prefer if it wasn't a pairing with two boys or if the age difference is to big. Thanks :)

  A continuation for "Love at First Sight". Catherine and Sara are to be getting married soon but that is only if Catherine could ever forgive Sara for a horrible mistake; forgetting their Anniversary. Maybe a case of a cliff side jumper out at Lake Mead is what's exactly needed to rekindle their love and then some...

** Oh gosh, if you want love/hate get into the Lily/James fics that is their bread and butter. Couldn't tell you how many of those I've read, but here are some that are good (warning there are a lot):

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/928550/1/Love-Life-and-Sugar-Highs]] Love, Life, and Sugar Highs Marauders, pranks, Beatles, romance and male owls called Mary! What else could you possibly ask for? LilyJames, Sirius, etc. The story of their seventh year. COMPLETED! Rated: Fiction M

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3555029/1/10-Things-I-Hate-About-James-Potter]] Ten Things I Hate About James Potter For James, it's a challenge. FOr Lily, it's about time. For their friends... it's annoying. The Bet: Get a girl to go out with you by the end of the week. The Girl: Lily Evans The Prize: 5 Galleons Sime enough, right? Not for James Potter. The Stakes: A lot higher than he thinks.

A story about friendship, trust, love, and realizing that people aren't always what they may seem. Rated: Fiction T

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2717445/1/Tears-on-the-Balcony]] Tears on the Balcony Lily & James have hated each other ever since their initial meeting took a wrong turn. After a shocking goodbye at the end of their 6th year, are things going to be any different in the following year when they are forced to work together as Head Boy and Head Girl? Rated: Fiction M My Note: This one and it's sequel are my absolute favorites on the list!!! If you do read these you'll have to message me and we can talk about them. ðŸ˜Š

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3927882/1/Kisses-on-the-Balcony]] Kisses on the Balcony James, Lily, and their friends are back to finish their 7th year. Before they can be released into a dangerous and war-filled world, they first have to confront their final Hogwarts days where friendships & relationships will be put to the ultimate test. Rated: Fiction M

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5048579/1/She-Said-What]] She Said What? LJ. Lily Evans keeps a diary in her seventh year to chronicle the strange, murky, embarrassing, and sometimes plain crazy events that a young witch set to graduate has to navigate through. Written in the style of 'Bridget Jones's Diary.' R&R? Rated: Fiction T

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2795240/1/Lily-s-List]] Lily's List LILY EVAN'S IMPOSSIBLY LONG LIST OF CHANGES THAT JAMES POTTER WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH IN ORDER FOR LILY EVANS TO DATE HIM is a list started by Lily her first night at Hogwarts. Will Lily risk getting hurt or simply add to the list when James changes? Rated: Fiction T

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7012597/1/You-Don-t-Say]] You Don't Say Lily genuinely liked James Potter. He was handsome enough to make any girl swoon, but he was also funny, clever, and secretly kind. Unfortunately, he could also be rude, thoughtless, spoiled, and cruel. Finding the balance was the tricky part. Author note: James is a jerk. Please don't be surprised. Rated: Fiction M

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8367728/1/Not-Marriage-Material]] Not Marriage Material This is another story of the marauders and the love lives of the group. This is in no way related to The Legacy Series. It is entirely different. Come with our four favorite Howarts trouble makers into traps, tricks, pranks, classes, quidditch and the scary world of the female mind. Broom closets beware none of you are safe. Rated because I get carried away sometimes... Rated: Fiction M

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7286177/1/Summer-Magic]] Summer Magic You mean to say that Potter's family is coincidentally staying across the street from our beach house for the summer, Mum and Mrs. Potter are now randomly best friends, and they expect me to hang out with that git for two months? You've got to be joking. (Even worse? There's a sequel.) Rated: Fiction T

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8480662/1/Other-Lives-and-Dimensions-Finally-a-Love-Story]] Other Lives And Dimensions & Finally A Love Story The year is 1977, and the Wizarding World is in turmoil. This is the story of the wizards' lost generation. (Skip the prologue, it's horrible) Rated: Fiction T

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6337679/1/Operation-Get-My-Lily]] Operation Get My Lily "I won't be another notch in your belt Potter!" Evans yelled across the Great Hall.- Lily hates James. James Loves Lily. Lily loves James. No wait, she hates James...its cupid stupid! All Marauder Characters involved! Rated: Fiction T
