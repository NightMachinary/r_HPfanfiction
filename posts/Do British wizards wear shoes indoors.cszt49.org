When going to sleep, would one just leave their shoes beside the bed? In a bathroom, does one take them off right before the shower, or leave them in the corridor outside? Or walk all the way back to the shoe rack at the entrance to put them away?

It's obvious that one would wear shoes inside Hogwarts, but what about the dorms? After showering, would they just put their shoes back on and then walk to the bed and kick them off again? Or go barefoot across a floor which is regularly threaded by muddy shoes?

It's a bit of a foreign concept to me, as you've probably guessed, but Harry Potter takes place in Britain, and the little details matter too.

I think there's a case to be made for wizards wearing shoes indoors, because they use Floo for transporation, and fireplaces are usually set in living rooms or maybe kitchens. So unless they put shoe cabinets and coat hooks beside a fireplace, any guests coming this way would just remain in their outdoor outfits.


** At Hogwarts, I picture the place as having largely stone floors, no carpet (but some area rugs), so I imagine they would keep them on and take them off in the dorms. Or at the very least have some form of footwear on.

Elsewhere - like British Muggles, it will largely vary.

** Most Brits take their shoes off when they enter the house, or at least before going upstairs. It would be a little odd, in my opinion, to wait until you were getting into bed or into the shower before taking them off, unless you were stumbling in drunk or something. Most of us walk about in socks/slippers/barefoot. There are frequent mentions of slippers in canon.

** I think, at Hogwarts, they would take their shoes off in their dorm rooms, by their beds or maybe at the door to their dorm, in order to keep the shoes from being lost, stolen or pranked. They would then keep their shoes off while in their common rooms, only putting the shoes on when they're going out into the castle proper. I assume the common rooms have carpets or at least lots of rugs.

** Context would vary, but I don't think it would be at all unusual for them to wear shoes indoors. Obviously if they were spending all day at home, they wouldn't put on shoes to walk around their own house. However, if someone came to visit the house, the visitor would not be expected to remove their shoes on entering.

Remember cleaning charms are easy, so there's even less need to make people remove shoes than in the Muggle world.
