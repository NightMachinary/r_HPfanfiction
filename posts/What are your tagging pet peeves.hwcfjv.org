What do you hate about the tagging system or the people's use of the tagging system. Dou you think the system should be better(I think the Ao3 system is great but poorl used sometimes, the ff system just sucks and HPFA is okay) or people should change how they tag? Really curious!

For example, I hate when the tags(in Ao3 mostly) completely give away the entire plot. Like, I really don't wanna know is "angst" but with a "Happy ending", like that takes away all the stakes for the characters, nothing that is presented as risky really is anymore and is flat out a spoiler. If it is good, or appears to be, I'll probably still read it, but the experience won't rly be the same cause I will have huge expectations and won't be as nervous for the characters.

Oh, and over tagging is no excuse for a bad synopsis.

*** I think there should be a way to distinguish between main characters and side characters in the ao3 tags. Like i always include Harry as a character, but that will also get me stories where he's just mentioned, and the main character is someone else. And when I exclude say Draco Malfoy, what I want to exclude is him as a main character. If the author tagged him because he appears like once to be an idiot, then I won't see that story even if I might have liked to read it.

*** Yeah, same with everything you can tag. Too many tags just sours the fic, especially for characters or relationships. If I wanna read a relationship, I wanna read it as a thing, not just an offhanded mention in chapter 316 of 12,000 that A and B maybe hooked-up that one time.

Makes it seem like people are either trying to spam across as many searches as possible in desperation for views, or they're trying to tell the entire damn story in tags anyway. :D

** what was already said. if there's like 10 inches of tags, then I'm not even gonna read one of them. talking in them, tagging every character instead of only the main ones, then unnecessary tags like, you are reading Drarry and there are tags gayDraco and gayHarry. ... we know! then tags the tagger doesn't even agree with: (this and that, but not really, only just a bit, but it's not like that, I swear,...) - that is actually the talking in tags too.

tags should really only be there for you to decide to read or not to read the story. like SlytherinHarry, OC, or muggleAU. something like Not beta read we die like men is nothing important to the story, so having it there is unnecessary.

that being said, I don't particularly like stories without the tags if they are on ao3, or ffn that don't include any character... and it only has a name and a summary that doesn't really say anything about the story. tags are there for a reason.

** One of the reasons I still prefer FF over AO3 is the reason of simplicity. Searching in AO3 is overwhelming. The sheer number of tags on one story is off putting. Combine that with the fact that you cant filter out the tags because tags are non standard , it causes a huge problem to filter out the junk.

I like standard tagging or a set of predefined flairs that ppl can choose from. Also AO3 has a lot of wierd stuff. I mean its not everyone's cup of tea.

*** Overall, I prefer ff.net. Like you said, simplicity. However, on AO3, one can exclude things. Excluding pairings I don't want to see, be they main or side, is a big help as I would normally close a story when I see such a pairing.

*** I don't really love FF cause I really think the community is quite toxic, but there's something to be said about simplicity. You being able to filter out tags is great and the rest of the tags are pretty straightforward and that makes for more effort put into the synopsis cause they can't rely on tags to explain the premise of the story.

But what I like in AO3 are the obscure tags or the very specific ones that allow me to go straight to the point.

(There are really weird things there, that's completely true)

** To me, there's no comparison between a website that censors content and one that celebrates freedom of expression. AO3 may have its flaws, but arbitrary banning of content isn't one of them. Nor should it be.

On a more lighthearted note, AO3 Tags are truly “a thing.” There are fics on AO3 that are written entirely in Tags that exist on the site. People get pretty creative!

That said, I personally detest authors who have tagged so heavily that the work they post takes up an entire screen. Invariably, these fics consist of pure smut! I wonder if a limit on the number of tags would help, since many of these heavily tagged works use tags such as “the author regrets nothing/the author regrets everything,” along with 100 bizarre sexual acts and 50 pairings (Reader/Albus Dumbledore, Reader/Rita Skeeter's Animagus form, yada yada.) Who cares???

Here's an example of an AO3 user's attempt to determine the most used tags on the site:

Here's a fic featuring AO3 Tags:

** I hate it when the amount of tags is in no relation to the length of the story. You don't need dozens of tags for a story that's like 2k words.

I like "angst with happy ending" because there are days I don't want to be nervous for characters. It's great for letting my mind to rest to know that after all the delicious pain everything will be fine.

** When authors 'talk' in the tags, using freeform. The bigger the wall of text, the worse. Like, honestly, why put what you can in the summary description in the tags?

On a different but slightly similar note, the tag "No beta we die like men" peeves me off due to it being a stupid thing to be proud of. So, they're basically feeling cool that their story almost certainly has a boatload of shit grammar and syntax eff-ups, then.

** FFN is not enough information, AO3 is too much information that I haven't bothered to learn to filter. I'm not too fussed about spoilers, since I care more about the execution of a plot than what the plot is.

What I find annoying is when an AO3 story's tags fills up my whole phone screen. The worst one was a harry-fucks-his-way-through-almost-literally-everyone fic where there were at least 50 pairings and multipairings listed. That one was a bit harder to skip over.

** The searching capability of tags in AO3 is pretty powerful and much better than the searching capabilityof ffn. But the number and types of tags are excessive. The freeform tag should probably be eliminated. Character tags should really only be for the primary characters not ones who show up as a cameo/single scene. Same with pairings eg if the pairing doesn't have significant scene time/story arc then it shouldn't be listed.

Multiple tags that pretty much say the same thing should also be eliminated. As mentioned by a previous commenter "Angst" and "Angst but really a happy ending" don't need to both be there. (And I would vote for just "Angst"). Seeing Humor, Parody, Parody with a twist, Crack, Crack!fic, Crack with Heart etc. I could see keeping Humor, Parody, and Crack but the others that are slight variations should be tossed.

** I don't like tags which say for pairings something like "No pairings listed as it's a surprise!" I don't want to be surprised, I want to know what pairings are included to be sure that its worth starting the story, because there are a lot of pairings that I won't read. I don't want to be unpleasantly surprised!

** Lack of additional tags is my biggest pet peeve. I don't care about the talking-in-tags, about the over-tagging, or about the lack of character tags or relationship tags /nearly/ as much as I do under-tagging. It just makes the story seem bland, even with summaries, and it usually tells me I won't get emotionally invested as much as I would like to (usually, that is -- not always).

** Yes, tags that give away pairings. I'd also prefer not to be warned of pairings, but more something to remark on an age appropriate relationship. Especially if you're going to have a few years before the relationship starts.

Tags that give away the plot are the absolute worst. To be honest, I prefer if the trigger warnings were under a spoiler alert style system. I don't want to know that a character dies before it gets to that point.

*** With character death there's the somewhat vague TW of "Major character death", even though you know someone will die, you can't know who; and say it's set in HBP and is canon compliant: Dumbledore will die and the TW will have been for him. But TW's like rape/non-con, graphic violence, torture, gore and the likes are very important so I don't really mind. And sometimes I actually want to read a more violent dark fic so I just click on the TW.

And about the pairings, I feel like most people wouldn't want them to be a mystery so I don't see that a lot of people would do it. I do like to be surprised from time to time, but mostly just really want to read my OTP without any stress. But giving away plot is terrible for me.

**** Yes, I appreciate other people want those things. In honesty, I tend to scroll by any fics with those sorts of warnings but it could have been a very good fic or a fic where the warning is actually quite minor or so on.

I'd prefer it if it was a sort of toggle on/toggle off system. I don't have an OTP, so I'd quite like to read a Harry who you think is maybe going to date one person, but actually dates another or not at all. Plus, the tags also tend to tell you if it's unrequited or they break up.

It's always seemed to me that trigger warnings should be in the warnings and not the tags anyway.

Plus, it would enable you to run searches (to find themes you might like) without being absolutely certain of what's going to happen.

** Both over-tagging and under-tagging are supper annoying to me.

If a story has like 1 relationship tagged and maybe 5 characters along with little to no summary, then I don't really wanna read it because it tells me nothing. Especially if the fic is really long (I've seen like 10k fics w only two character tags and no summary- like what?) Sometimes I just skip to the comments and spoil something for myself just to even get an idea what the fic is about.

And if a story has like every character ever mentioned and every relationship imaginable and it requires me to swipe my thumb (mobile user) three times to just get to the summary, then my hopes and standards are already down. Also people not even in/important to the story being tagged. Example: fics where James and Lily aren't even in the story as more than a passing mention and they're tagged as both characters and a relationship. Where is the logic in that other than to spam your story over every tag ever.

I agree that while ao3 has a decent filtering system; with the sheer amount that people over-tag there should be more specifications. The main characters and side characters or main ships and side ships. Part why I like still like ffn a lot, it doen't allow over character/relationship tagging. Still think they should and (limited) custom tags or something. So authors don't have to sacrifice summary space for things like: TimeTravelAU, or Slytherin!Harry, CanonDivergence, shorthand ships HPGM/RWHG/NLLL, or EWE ect...

** I only read fics on FF and AO3 so I can only talk about these tagging systems :

FF is too restrictive, the limit of 4 tagged characters is reached really fast, so only the "Main" characters are tagged and you have to read a fic to find the supportive cast.

AO3 is not restrictive enough. There is no limit to the number of tags so some authors tag everyone, including the cameos (a 30s apparition back in 1st year).\\
Also, the system is a mess because authors can create the tags themselves. One fic I am reading is an illustration of this problem. It is an "conscious Scarecrux" story with currently 2 books. The author created his own tag for the conscious Scarecrux (so the tag only showed his story), and later changed this tag for the 2nd story. So you have know (at least) 2 tags with each only one story inside. They can't be used to find similar fics that you could like.\\
Outside of that the fic is really nice.
