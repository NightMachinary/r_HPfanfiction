** Seconding JBern, but also in linkffn(A Black Comedy), the fight between Harry, Sirius, and Voldemort, though really short and only one of two fight scenes in the entire book, is pretty high on my list. The second fight scene in Hogsmeade is one of the best 'somewhat' realistic Harry kicking ass scenes.

** I would have to preface this by saying that a great many of the stories I am going to suggest aren't that good; however, they do contain brilliant fights.

To continue then: I must third the recommendation of Jbern (particularly the fights in Bungle in the Jungle, even if the story has problems), and A Black Comedy. I would also suggest linkffn(The Wastelands of Time); linkffn(A Stranger in an Unholy Land) has some very well done fights, though the story isn't that great as a whole; the Denarian Knight series is pretty good; linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom) has some good sequences; linkffn(Delenda Est), and linkffn(To Play the Devil) has a number which I enjoyed.

  Immortality is not all it's cracked up to be. At least not when the only other immortal around is your worst enemy and the closest thing to a friend you have left. The war ended over a hundred years ago and Harry Potter and Tom Riddle have each been enjoying the quiet life, whilst politely ignoring each other. However, war is coming. AU. Complete.
