I read a fic a while back called Make a Wish where Harry tries to take a vacation and all kinds of crazy stuff happens. I'd like to find more traveling fics. Stuff where Harry decides to go get a bunch of stuff and just explore the world wizard or muggle it doesn't matter. So hit me with your best fics. For those that are interested here's the link for Make a Wish.

*** Probably Brennus' best fic. Better than the 'lol random coincidental' Make A Wish.

**** I like the travel part of MaW better than the random badassness. I like getting to read about the different gear and locations. Something different than the same old Hogwarts/Britain.

** I haven't read Make a Wish yet, so I'm not sure if these stories completely fit your criteria. But they're both well written tales that take place in exotic locations far away from wizarding Britain. Though they're a little more "survival" based, than tourism based, they might be worth a read.

edit: Forests of Valbone is more or less complete even though it doesn't say it's complete.

*** I was wrong about Bungle in the Jungle. It was called Harry Potter and the Soul Gem. My bad.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

*** Forest of Valborn looks good but I just can't read Bungle in the Jungle. Something about a guy getting pregnant that just throws me off. Up till that point it's a great story.
