I just had to recommend this.

It is a truly good story. I never enjoyed time travel fanfics until this.

Shows the Blacks turning good, Bellatrix going "muggle" Bad-ass Harry and some very subtle humor

**** It was posted on his website and then later on reddit that he was admitted to hospital due to stage 4 cancer. By the time the post was made the cancer had spread to his bones & liver, if I remember correctly.

#+begin_quote
  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** I've just finished reading this, and... meh.

I remember earlier in the year everyone was panting about how good this story was so I started it and didn't see what the fuss was about. First there's the implausibility of the story as a whole: Harry shows up and within a couple of days, has pretty much converted some of Voldemort's supporters to his side.

Then there's the way the story unfolds, which is largely long boring chats between old wizards intermixed with confusing battle scenes.

Then the writing is often plain bad. Take this line from Chapter 18: '"Just a couple more, Riddle," Harry stated back with a sharp glare that was razor sharp.' "Stated back"? That's not good English. And "sharp glare that was razor sharp" is tautological, and there are dozens of examples of that kind of writing.

Lastly, the plot is linear and boring.

So having originally not seen what the fuss was about, I'm now sure it was much ado about nothing.
