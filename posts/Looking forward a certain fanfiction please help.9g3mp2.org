It's a au after the war story where I believe harry is abandoned by Ron and Hermione. Harry is distraught but pulls himself together and starts a company/charity with the help of Draco aND daphne is his assitant. He dates a few OCS like a model but ultimately ends up with daphne I think. Can't find it anywhere please help.
