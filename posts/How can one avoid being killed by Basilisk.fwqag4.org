I just got a thought after seeing [[https://grickenfish.tumblr.com/post/119353845601/uv-protection-saves-lives][this]].

Colin Creevey saw it through his camera, Justin Finch-Fletchley saw it through the ghost, Hermione and Penelope Clearwater saw it a miror, Mrs. Norris saw the reflection in the water.

Could a death by Basilisk really be avoid by wearing glasses/sunglasses? Would it somehow matter if lenses were tanned, medical ones or just a plain glass (that people who have a good eyesight but want to wear glasses have)? What about seeing the Basilisk through the window? Should have the Hogwarts staff just handed everyone a pair of glasses?


** I think even plain glass would work. Colin was using an old-fashioned camera where you look at your subject through a viewfinder. He's not actually looking at it through the lens, but rather, through tiny pieces of clear glass right on top of the lens. So, basically, it's the same as seeing it through plain glass.

** IMO, it's implied that looking at it directly through glass/glasses would not work - after all, Myrtle wears glasses and got killed by it.

*** She was crying right? I'd assume she had to take off her glasses to cry.

** I read a fanfic with Hermione changing the lens of I think normal sunglasses to blue because snakes have red/orange/yellow eyes and you couldn't get petrified if you didn't see the Basilisk's eyes, and when she got caught by the Basilisk Penelope and her only got stunned for a while.

** I mean, if memory serves, it's just making eye-contact with the thing that gets you petrified, so just... don't look it in the eye? Or get those periscope glasses that make you look off at an angle.

** Uh, don't forget that it also has a mouth full of teeth and is also highly venomous, not to mention the antidote to the venom is very very rare.
