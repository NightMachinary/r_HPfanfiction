Faking a suicide or tragic accident, being kidnapped, actually dying and reincarnating, etc. Preferably with examination of how his supposed or actual death affected. No harems, and I've already seen the one where it looks at reactions after Harry commits suicide, as well as the more popular fix-its post death. Thanks!


** Linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter)

As a young kid before Hogwarts, he accidentally runs into a Death Eater and gets tortured to death. Then he wakes up on the morning before. This time he takes a different path and survives.

When he goes to Diagon, he ventures into Knockturn and gets stabbed. So the next time he gets more money and doesn't use shady shops.

On the Hogwarts express he gets shoved off the train car and on the track.

At Hogwarts he gets shoved off stairs, smashed by the Troll, Avada Kedavrad by Quirrel, and that's just the first few months.

#+begin_quote
  Despair over the loss of his godfather in the Battle of the Dept. of Mysteries, followed by abandonment, isolation and hopelessness drive Harry to try and end his own life. Though death itself cannot halt his just vengeance against the Dark Lord, nor keep him from attaining that which he has ever been denied; someone to love and be loved by.
