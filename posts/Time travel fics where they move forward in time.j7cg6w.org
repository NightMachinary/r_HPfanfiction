Most of the time travel i see is like someone going back to their own time or like Harry's gen going back to Marauders time or Tom Riddle's time.

So here its the other way around where someone from the past is sent forward like young tom riddle ending up in the marauders era for example ( doesn't necessarily have to be Harry's time they are sent to). They are aware probably this is a different time but have no idea what the future is like till they get there.

The mc should be whoever got sent forward in time.

plot and friendship based to romance based

no romance with the person who got sent forward in time would be more preferable but it ok if there is romanxe

no major character x oc ships

no hermione x the time traveler ships i feel like i see thst alot so for variety if anyone has romance with time traveler it not Hermione

no hermione x draco

no incest ships

no sex swap ( aka a character who is a boy in canon is now a girl was born female and identifies as a girl or vice versa. Trans characters dont count as sex swap)

apart from that anything goes m/m, m/f, f/f its all good

  James Potter made a vow to himself that his seventh year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry would be different. He would be responsible, kind, and (hopefully) get the girl. Yes, this year would be different. He had no idea...

  In the summer after Harry's sixth year, Harry and Remus uncover a section of the Marauder's Map which has been hidden for the past twenty years, releasing a carbon copy of sixteen-year-old Sirius Black from its depths. As they prepare for the impending war, Sirius must find a place for himself in this new world, Harry must find a way to destroy Voldemort, and Remus must face his own past while trying to build a tenuous future with Tonks.
