Are there any good fics where Harry is just a genuinely nice guy? Are there any crossovers like that? How about a WBWL fic? A WBWL crossover? 'Cuz I keep finding absolute douchenozzle harry after absolute douchenozzle Harry. Like I get it, your life sucks Harry but you don't have to make everyone else's life suck too you know.


** YES! There are fics like that!

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6122017][Outsiders and Other Eldritch Entities]] In which Harry became an surprisingly nice Eldrich Horror when he united the Hallows. Series, Complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5165369/1/][My Nephew Harry]] In which Vernon and Petunia die and Harry and Dudley are raised by Marge Dursley. Very in character and well done. Multi chapter, Complete

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6519436/1/][Criminality]] In which Harry helps one of Dudley's bullying victims. Oneshot, Complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5102870/1/][The Double Agent]] In which Harry is not the BWL, but still saves the day. Oneshot, Complete

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11115934/1/][The Shadow of Angmar]] LOTR crossover. Harry gets stuck in Middle Earth and ends up helping a lot of people while trying to find his way back. WIP, still being updated.

All of these are gen. If you want I can supply more with added Drarry or other pairings.

**** Alright then. *cracks nuckles* (At this point maybe I should note that I interpret "nice" as "not trying to make anyone miserable for no reason", him trying to be helpful without being overly condecending, and that I usually try my best to avoid bashing of any kind. So that's my standart for "Nice Harry". I know it's low. Have fun with these anyway.)

*Drarry first:*

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7145645][Blackberry Jam]] World War II, Nonmagic AU which is glorious, Harry and Draco both get evacuated out of London together. Multichapter, Complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1360492/1/][Eclipse]] In which Draco captures Harry for the Dark Lord and comes to regret that decision. Multichapter, Complete.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3688899][Like Diamonds We Are Cut With Our Own Dust]] In which the Dark Mark keeps harming Draco well after the Dark Lord is dead and Harry finds a solution. Oneshot, Complete.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2752127][Consequences of Redemption]] Canon Divergence AU in which Draco leaves Malfoy Manor with the trio and is dragged along the horcrux hunt. Multichapter, Complete.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1124273][The Printed Press]] Not exactly nice Harry and mild Ginny bashing in the beginning, but explaination is given and the fic is worth a read. Harry has become a recluse after the war and Draco writes his biography. Multichapter, Complete.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/990428][No Shadow Taller Than Our Souls]] Case fic. Auror Harry and Unspeakable Draco investigating. There exists a podfic of this too but it's been ages since I downloaded that and I don't have the link anymore. Long Oneshot, Complete.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7229365][If Today Was Your Last Day]] Half canon divergence, half tag to the battle of Hogwarts. Harry knows he has to die and meets Draco on his way to the forest. Oneshot, Complete.

*And now for the* *one* *gen I kinda forgot the first time, and some crossovers*:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11456392/1/][Proud]] Petunia dies before ever telling Vernon about the magical world, when Harry comes to live with him he does his best to raise him right. Lot's of family feels but not actually that ooC. Gen, Multichapter, Complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9281191/1/][Animorph, Animagus]] Which is an Animorphs crossover and pretty much exactly what you'd expect a Harry Potter/Animorphs crossover to be, lbr. Gen, Oneshot, Complete

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6833957/1/][Deathly Hollowed]] Bleach crossover, Harry/Orihime. Harry is Ulquiorra and... well about as kind as Unquiorra is able to get with all the Despair and Nihilism. There are some "crule to be kind" aspects but it's a good read with a nice and melancholy but hopeful ending. Multichapter, Complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3632982/1/][Torn between Sides]] Charmed Crossover, Harry/Chris Halliwell. Charmed Season 6 AU. Harry is a half demon and trying his best to keep the balance between good and evil, while more or less willingly on the side of evil.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5730598/1/][Martyrdom and Paradox]] Death Note Crossover, Harry/L. During the Kira investigation L meets Harry in a cake shop. One of the few crossovers that also involves Harry's friendship with Ron and Hermione in a positive way. Multichapter, Complete.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/series/8722][Doctor Who/Harry Potter]] Doctor Who crossover. Hinny, Harry/the Doctor. A series in which Harry is kinda in love with the Doctor while also married to Ginny and it's mostly fine. No Ginny bashing is what I remember most fondly about this. Sadly abandoned, but still worth a read.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/585857][Not as Grimm as it Seems]] Grimm crossover, Gen. Harry moves to Portland where Nick and Monroe think he is another Grimm in denial of his abilities. Very short and very sporadic updates. Multichapter, WIP

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10216252/1/][The Triumph of These Tired Eyes]] Marvel Crossover. Gen. Loki is Harry's dad. This changes a lot of things but not all of them for the better. Family/Friendship fic mostly. I especially liked the Drarry Bromance. Multichapter, Complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096486/1/][Sowilo]] Marvel Crossover. Loki/Harry. A coffeeshop AU, because no rec list is complete without at least one of them. Twoshot, complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9589128/1/][Somewhere Safe]] Marvel Crossover. Loki/Harry. Loki tries to teleport "somewhere save" and lands in Harry's backyard. Oneshot, Complete.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5366507][Spellist]] Another Marvel Crossover, because I have a type apparently. Harry/Coulson. Harry gets thrown in the MCU and becomes a magician for hire. He's more apathetic than kind in this but he gets slightly better towards the end? IDK why I'm including this here but it's a good read and Harry is not an asshole in it so there. (Just on a side note, this one is by [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/esama/pseuds/esama][esama]] and if you haven't checked out their page yet, you're missing out. They write beautifully original stories and some very nice trope subversions) Oneshot, Complete

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1113600][Magnificent]] Sherlock crossover. Mycroft/Harry. In which Harry is the Ministry of Magic the same way that Mycroft is the British Government. Oneshot, Complete.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1134255][Whispers in Corners]] Sherlock crossover. Mycroft/Harry. In which Harry uses the resurrection stone to become a medium. Multichapter, complete.

That's it from me. Have fun with all of these ;)

** I think the nicest Harry that I can remember (at least in a story with decent writing) was Prince of the Dark Kingdom linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom).

Harry wants to get along with pretty much everybody (with a couple of notable exceptions). His desire to do the right thing in this fic somehow makes him even more reckless than in canon, and by quite a bit. Part of that is, I think, in contrast to Voldemort who is malicious and plans for the long-term (he is immortal).

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  Having been treated as a servant his entire life, Harry is more sympathetic when Dobby arrives, avoiding Vernon's wrath and gaining a bit of freedom. That freedom changes his summer, his life, and the world forever. A very long character-driven story that likes to play with canon. (Now at Hogwarts)
