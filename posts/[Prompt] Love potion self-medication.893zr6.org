So, if arranged marriages / marriage contracts are as popular as fanon claims they are, there's going to be a lot of people trapped in loveless marriages. Fortunately, this is why we have love potions.

I've thought of some examples:

- Don't love your husband/wife anymore? There's a potion for that
- Don't want to commit adultery despite having found someone to do it with? There's no need to worry, you can just get back to being hopelessly in love with your spouse with the help of this potion
- Fallen in love with someone who doesn't like you? Just make the feelings go away

There are practically infinite possibilities! Has anyone seen something like that?

**** No. The Drug from Brave New World. If the prompt doesn't treat it as something that is actually completely and utterly horrible then what's the point?

** I don't recall seeing it in an actual fic, but I have seen discussing/theorizing that some couples routinely, consensually love-potion each other, either permanently, or when they hit a rough patch, or for Valentine's Day.

** Hm...I've read a fiction like that (sorry, that was years ago, so no: I don't remember the title or the author!) where it was Lily Evans (yes, Harry's mother!) doing exactly that because she needed a pureblood's connections in order to continue learning magic (gaining a mastery!) after Hogwarts (her status as a "mudblood" would have prohibited that otherwise!)...hell, is this really so out of the question? I mean everybody said that James Potter grew up and Lily started to like him, but seriously? I mean I couldn't start to like someone I've spent years despising, no matter what they do (Yes, I am that "narrow minded") because part of me will always see the person I despised...sure I would be able to deal with that person professionally and I might even hang out with that person from time to time (if friends of mine are there!), but a relationship? Nope, not happening!

** I've read a story where that's happens, but it is a really small part. Like literary one or two paragraphs max. It happens in the epilogue of linkffn(The Marriage Contracts Redux by Clell65619)

  A rewrite of 'Harry Potter and the Marriage Contracts' done to improve some of the story elements, cut down on the Weasley bashing, and generally make a bit more sense. The changes are minor, but I believe make for a better story.
