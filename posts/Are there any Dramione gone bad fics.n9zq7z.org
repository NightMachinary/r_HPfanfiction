Dramione is one of the most popular pairings in fanfiction, but I don't like Draco Malfoy so I'm wondering if there are any stories where the Draco x Hermione ship burns and sinks. Thx in advance

*** I'm also not a fan of everyone else turning into complete assholes. I e Harry becoming an uncaring fuck the Weasleys domestic abusers and everyone who was a good guy becoming a prick or manipulative bastard.

**** Like I said, understandable. I honestly hate shipping Hermione and Draco. I just feel like it's a waste of time to read about a story where a good character gets shat all over and ends with a broken relationship. I'm probably being a bit dramatic but why don't you just look for good stories instead? Find something where everyone who's canonically good isn't an asshole?
