I've read it, and it was a cool premise though a little over the top at times. Plus all of the female characters were basically just love interests. /cough/ Susan /cough/

Any other longer fics that chronicle the D.A. at hogwarts during 7th year?


** That was my issue with Year of Darkness as well. Neither Ginny nor Luna were romantically involved with anyone during that year, and they weren't utilized to their full potential as far as character development. I've actually been working on a story as well, with Ginny as the main character (because she rarely gets any spotlight outside of being Harry's love interest, sadly), but it will be awhile. I want to completely finish it before I post it.

*** I've wanting to write a nice long Ginny-centric D.A. multi-chapter forever, but I haven't been consistent and it's a long long way from being finished. I love Ginny, and want to do more with her character.

I think Year of Darkness has become head canon for a lot of people, and it's so in-depth that it might kind of scare people off. But I do think there's a "niche" for a DA fic that puts more emphasis on Ginny.

Also the author has an /insane/ history, I can't even wrap my head around all of that level of drama and destruction.

**** What do you mean about the author? I've read the story, but don't know anything outside of just the general plot line.

***** I can't even explain it. There's just so much WTF.

Google thanfiction or Andrew Blake or Amy Player or Victoria Bitter (spoiler alert: they're all the same person).

**** Ginny was definitely present in Year of Darkness...but I just felt that she was just there to fill a spot. I think she holds a lot of potential as a main character (she's got gumption, she's probably very worried about her family, and she has all those demons in her past from the diary). It's been fun putting it together.

An OC can totally work. Also, I don't know if your story centers on this, but you can even pull a character who didn't go to Hogwarts. Voldemort made school education mandatory for all wizarding students in the UK. So you can have someone who was home schooled or sent somewhere else. That would be an interesting story as well. In fact, anyone's opinion outside of the main trio during this time would be interesting, lol.

****** That's awesome! I love plotting out a story; I think it's more fun than actually writing! I wrote out a timeline for this story, and I've got four chapters outlined and half of one written. We'll see how this goes :)

** Yes!!!! [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8078750/1/A-Call-to-Arms][A Call to Arms]] is extremely well written and the characters are all so well developed! It's probably my favorite fic out there. Everything that author writes is great.

** I'm currently writing a 10-chapter novella that follows one of the DA members during that year. Depending how that goes, I'll be adding others following different members, all set in the same 'universe'.

I'm just getting started though, 2/10 chapters posted. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11079096/1/Seven-Devils][Seven Devils]]

It's a sadly under explored year with a lot of potential so I hope to see more fics about it.
