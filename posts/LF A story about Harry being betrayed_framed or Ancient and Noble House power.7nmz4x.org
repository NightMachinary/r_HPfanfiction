First off, sorry about the two random unrelated topics but both are interesting to me! With regards to the first one, I've read all the top ones already like Redemption and Betrayed and Earl of the North and such. Second topic is more about the power of the Houses and something that enables Harry to fight with (doesn't necessarily mean he is all powerful and whatnot but can be)


** How about an Ancient House with fancy powers that was betrayed?

It was on Hiatus for a long time but had a couple of updates back in July. Hope the author picks it back up again.

*** I stopped reading after the second chapter. It always baffles me to see Dumbledore try to stop Harry from becoming a Dark Lord when Harry hasn't showed any sign that he'd become so /and/ doing so by forcing Harry to do things he doesn't want to do. It's just completely idiotic reasoning. What better way to turn someone against you than by constantly doing things that'll build up resentment?

  Voldemort has always wanted to kill him, and the support of magical Britain has been inconsistent at best. What happens when Harry learns that some of those closest to him are not what they seem? Harry Potter one-shot. H/HG. Rated M to be safe.

** My series, linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn) linkffn(The Chessmaster: White Knight) has lots of politics, scheming, and Noble/Ancient houses. It starts in first year (Black Pawn) and has multiple points of view. Harry won't get involved with politics until later, but you can see what's going on in the political world through other characters' perspectives.
