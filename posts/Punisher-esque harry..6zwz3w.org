Any stories where harry kills all the bad guys basically. Where he has the mentality of kill one person possibly save 1,000.

Complete or past fourth year or 100k+ words please. Want a nice long read please.


** I don't know many of those kill 1 save 1000 things but here's a bunch of ones where Harry doesn't really mind murderizing his way through a couple dozen people to get at his goal. Let me know if you want some Harry goes psycho stories. I know a lot of those.

  Fic is edgy as fuck in a couple places (I never forgive or whatever) but overall it's a nice story about Harry slowly changing.

#+begin_quote
  This series is really hit or miss. Personally I read the series for one of the most awesome Dumbledore in fanfiction. Once you get past the first couple chapters Harry kills /a lot/ of people and mainly is looking out for himself.

#+begin_quote
  Harry from an AU lands in a reality where his parents are alive and have two kids and things in general are pretty chill. His dimension's Voldemort was rezzed a month after his first defeat so things went to shit there. iirc he slaughters most of the death eaters when they attack the World Cup.

  Harry doesn't start out willing to but as the story progresses he has to. This fic is fantastic. Can't recommend it enough. There's this second layer of reality in reflections that's slowly converging with our own and it's kinda horrifying.

#+begin_quote
  Harry slowly transfigures different parts of his body to make himself stronger, pulling himself ever further from the way normal people think. He has /zero/ problems with killing. Highly goal oriented Harry, Neville is the boy who lived and Harry's parents are laid up in St. Mungo's.

  Hunger Games crossover *ITS NOT WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE I SWEAR*

  Fem!Harry ends up in Hunger!verse via accidental magic and gets raised by Snow to be a tribute. Harry comes out brutal and obsessed with weapons. It's got a hilariously awesome second task too. Really wish the author's version of Demiguise had ended up in the movie over that silly monkey thing because what they have is some good shit.

#+begin_quote
  Exactly what the title says. The pairing isn't a big thing. Harry is kinda psychopathic? Ignore the pairing. It 100% won't play out like you think.
#+end_quote

That whole Black Princess series

#+begin_quote
  Not linking it because there's a lot that I /hate/ about it. It's creepy as shit and you're gonna need to skip chapters if you're disgusted by child brothels, Dumbledore/James/Lily bashing (admittedly a hell of a lot less of that lately), that sort of thing. Beyond that though? I can't overstate how much I love the idea of a Light/Dark cult war going on with infighting between different gods. It is beyond a doubt the coolest and most unique thing about the series. I haven't found anything similar even close to readable.

#+begin_quote
  World of Warcraft crossover. Harry gets stolen by an imp after Dumbledore's baby dump. Harry is raised by Gul'dan as his apprentice in the service of a demonic army hell bent on sucking the life out of every reality or something. Heads back to Potterverse pretty quick.

#+begin_quote
  Ancient fic. Hasn't aged too badly though. Someone slaps a bounty on Harry's head and he flees to America to life under a different name and go to a different school. Characters are almost entirely of fairly well-done OCs. It's got all the trappings of a garbage fic but the author makes it work somehow.

#+begin_quote
  Been a while since I've read this fic but from what I remember Harry's a magical drug dealer so I assume he'd be pretty okay with killing.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  Series dedicated to a what-if of Pettigrew kidnapping Potter instead of having Voldemort off him. Very fun. Author's got a rewrite of the first one going right now. Not sure how it compares but I remember enjoying the series. Harry is obviously pretty okay with the whole killing thing.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11035459/1/Oblivion][Oblivion]]

#+begin_quote
  Elder Scrolls crossover. Harry is a reborn daedra that prides itself on a lack of emotion. There are other ones already out there. The fic does the whole neglected sibling thing except Harry systematically causes it and it's only everyone else who gives a shit. It's pretty funny imo even if the fic doesn't really play it for laughs.

Hermione's absolute paranoia is half of what makes the fic, with the other half being Rose's cheerful brutality.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

*** Yeah. This is the story that got me into wanting more of it. Do you know of ahy others. Doesn't have to be punisher as long as he's got that take no shit attitude, and mentality of if you're gonna put them down make sure they can't get back up again.

** In most of my stories, that's the general mentality of the good guys, including Dumbledore (who doesn't like killing, but would rather do it himself than let anyone else shoulder that burden).

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12155794/1/Honour-Thy-Blood][*Honour Thy Blood*]] - *TheBlack'sResurgence* - Harry learns the ways of the Potter family. The Potters were warriors who fought in real wars, and as such were willing to get their hands dirty to win and survive, even willing to use the darkest of spells to do so. They're not a "Dark" family though, just warriors pure and simple.

When Harry accepts to "/Honour Thy Blood/" by adopting his family's ways, he turns back on Dumble's philosophy of giving people a second chance. He stresses that they're fighting a war, and they won't win it by throwing just stunners around. They have to shoot to kill. linkffn(12155794)

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.
