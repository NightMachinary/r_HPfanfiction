** - trigger warning all the things! Here's how to isolate yourself from everything, and you should definitely make it as easy as possible for your readers to isolate themselves from their crippling phobias of discussion of the holocaust and fatphobia. (No joke, I looked up "trigger warning list" and found both on such a list.)

- genderswap fics are evil! The characters are clearly swapping sexes, and "swap" implies *erasure* of those who are gender nonbinary.

- rowling needs to stop crushing fan theories because clarifying things about the canon universe /she/ created and owns takes away power from fans

All great articles so far! I'm really excited to read more from this enriching, nuanced publication.

  And it has an entire article to "shill" AO3. That's the entire article. I'm serious: it's literally called "How Archive of Our Own Revolutionized Fandom".
#+end_quote

Did you actually read that article? I think it's unfair to call it nothing but shilling AO3.

  Regardless, AO3 has accomplished the goal Astolat laid out in that seminal post back in May of 2007: It's a place by fans, for fans, where fans can gather and archive their work without concern for legality or censorship. It was born from a desire not to be beholden to original content creators or advertisers, and it has always been true to that goal, staying afloat primarily through charitable donations from users.

  For many though, AO3 was the advent of fandom coming together to defend their hobby and preserve their history, a place where the principles of fannish creativity would outweigh watchdog and advertiser concerns about controversial content. Six years and over a million fan works later, they're still going strong.
#+end_quote

Come on. I didn't say it was /only/ shilling, in any case, just that that was the article's purpose.

And shill generally refers to someone pretending to be an independent third party while really being employed or compensated by the the party being praised. I doubt AO3 paid them to write this article.

It's a bit effusive when it gets to AO3, but it's not even mentioned until halfway through the article. Most of it is a history of fandom on the internet.

****** I used "" for a reason. Obviously they're not being paid to write it, but since they're a magazine and as such supposed to be somewhat objective it was the best verb I could come up with. "Unfairly promoting", maybe?

And it isn't a history of fandom, or even fanfiction fandom, it'd take more than one article to cover that. It's a history of how AO3 came to be.

According to whom? I don't even expect true impartiality from actual news outlets, let alone an online magazine dedicated to fanfiction. You should probably read every article as an op-ed.

'a history' doesn't imply that it's entirely comprehensive.

All that being said, I haven't seen much of interest in the articles that hasn't been said before here. And a lot of it's... tumblr-y.

That says more about the "actual news outlets" you choose to read than your point, honestly.

And it seems we agree in general, so I have no idea why we're even arguing over nitpicks.

******** I think op-ed is a good word to describe the tone of many of our pieces. In some ways, I think of this magazine as a way for people to come together to write about the fandom topics they care about. Maybe somewhere between a group blog and a magazine? It's meant to be a fun project for both me and our freelance writers, and hopefully, there will be readers who appreciate what we're trying to do.

And seriously, if you feel like you have something to say about fandom that you think would make a good addition to the site, I encourage you to PM me.

*** Hey there! I thought I'd chime in since I'm the one running the magazine. Your critiques are absolutely valid. I agree that a lot of our articles focus on Tumblr and AO3. Not only that, but it is also very western centric. It's not ideal, but we're still new so our combined fandom experience is limited to the handful of writers regularly writing for the site.

I love your ideas, though. Those suggestions are actually very much in line with the things I'd like to see on the site. One day! Meanwhile, if you ever feel like you'd like to write for us, please PM me. More contributors = more diverse articles = a better magazine.
