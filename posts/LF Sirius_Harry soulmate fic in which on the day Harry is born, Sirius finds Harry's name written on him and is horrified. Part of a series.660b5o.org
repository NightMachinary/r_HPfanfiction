I found this a few weeks ago and then lost it! If anyone can find it, I'd super appreciate it. It sounds super weird but it was really well written.

*** Weeell, your right. I want to argue it - AU and all - but I haven't read it and based on Cannon relationship between Sirius and Harry and the age gap and the relationship that Sirius has with his family... It's... well, you said it better.

**** The fic itself deals with Sirius' distress at having a soul mate that young, and his own horrific reaction.

*** Ao3- part of a series. First fic was incomplete, but there was a later fic that was complete... Think it was a one - shot.

** Not sure if [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12443394/4/Interwoven-Souls][this]] is the same - /Azalea/ Potter is born (a girl), and Sirius realizes that she is his soul-bonded-whatever.

It's a very interesting concept, and if this isn't what you were looking for, and you come across your request, I'd love to read it.

  Every magical is born knowing that one day they will be bonded to the soul intended for them. Every magical eagerly awaits their seventeenth birthday, the day in which they will receive the identity of the person that they will live the rest of their lives with. Only, it's not always as simple as that. Marauders gen. Then golden trio gen. Femharry (Again). James/Lily
