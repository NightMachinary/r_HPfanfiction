For those who don't know, the Downward Spiral Saga is a 6-part series that depicts Harry's (surprise surprise) downward spiral into darkness and evil. He eventually becomes almost as crazy as Bellatrix and near Voldemort's level of power and evilness. Its fantasticly written and its a believable slope, with nearly no cringe-worthy moments (I do not forgive, I do not forget) but with a lot of angst and more warnings that I can remember, from child rape to full blown graphical torture. Even so, its amazing and definitely a unique story.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Homecoming) is the first of the series, and it has 1 spin-off with Nymphadora and Bellatrix.

It also has a Harry from anotherr mini-series called linkffn(For lack of a bezoar) in which the divergence point is the fact that Harry couldn't save Ron with the bezoar in time. Then a bunch of shit happens because of it, the war is a lot bloodier because Harry and Hermione stop giving a fuck about morality, though is a believable way and not at all OOC.

And Canon Harry.

So yeah, this has the makings to be a great battle royale fuckfest with bloody good action.

  Our choices define us. When Harry and his closest friends are transported to an alternate dimension, thirty years after the war's end, and forced to face the results of what would have been if only they had chosen differently, he will discover just how true this is. Features H/G, H/H, H/DG. Not multi.

  Canon Divergence from HBP. When Harry fails to save Ron's life in Slughorn's office, he and Hermione are thrust into a search for answers. But the path is thornier than either of them could have possibly imagined.
