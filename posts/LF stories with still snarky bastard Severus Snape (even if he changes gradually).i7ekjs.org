Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can be any era, would rather it be completed, but if not that's fine. Would rather not have Weasley bashing (if at all possible).

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash, threesomes, doesn't have to focus on a pairing.

I love complicated characters, and Severus Snape is one hell of a complicated character. Rather you like him or not, I think (most of us), can agree on that.

I love character driven stories, I love stories where characters change with time or because of circumstances, but in believable ways.

A lot of times though, I'll read a story and even though I'm liking it, in the back of my head I'll think: I can never see Severus Snape actually saying this, even with change.

So, any still snarky bastard Severus Snape, in stories that are relatively believable, even if he does end up changing over time? I just can't see him lose his snarky bastard persona completely.


** Might I offer some shameless self-promotion? The fic I'm currently co-writing features asshole Snape & we absolutely love exploring his character, his morals, and his past history. It's eventual mentor Snape, but how we write him, he's always going to be prickly, regardless of how sympathetic he may become.

It's a longfic, and /far/ from completed, but if it seems like something you might want to check out, it's on FFnet & ao3: linkao3(A Lamb Before the Slaughter)

  Terror and destruction seemed inevitable after Voldemort finally revealed himself to the Wizarding World but, at Hogwarts, Harry lives a disturbingly unchanged life. He exists in parallel to the people around him and, as time passes, the line between friend and foe stretches into a complex gradient, difficult to decipher. Seeking desperately to become the hero the Order needs, it becomes more and more clear to him how dangerous that prospect is.But, in a life fraught with crisis and tragedy, what's just a little more?
