In the Cursed Child, Cedric Diggory became a Death-Eater when he survived the Triwizard Tournament and I wonder under what circumstances will Cedric Diggory become a Death-Eater.


** None, it was one of the most glaring nonsenses in the Cursed Child.

** DeathEater!Cedric can backfire:

/[*Cedric* makes it to the Triwizard cup before Harry, finds himself in Little Hangelton.]/

*Babymort:* Hmm... Not exactly whom I had hoped for, but you will do. Wizard, you have the honour of witnessing and facilitating the return of Lord Voldemort himself!

*Cedric:* Lord Voldemort?! Ever since I was a small child I have admired your cause and despaired that I had been born too late to fight at your side! But then, I got sorted into Hufflepuff, and they expect you to be /nice/ to everyone, including Potter and his mudblood sidekick! My Lord, thank you for bestowing this honour and opportunity upon me! How may I facilitate your return?

*Babymort:* You can't.

*Cedric:* But My Lord, I am prepared to offer my wand and my very blood and soul!

*Babymort:* I know, and that's the problem!

** TBH, I could see a fanfiction written where Cedric is the person who bewitched the Goblet of Fire instead of Crouch. It would be difficult to write convincingly, but it would be a wild twist. Could have Harry super suspicious of Moody the whole time due to the whole "every defense professor wants to kill me" thing and at the end it could be revealed that Moody really is just a creepy old dude and he was genuinely trying to help Harry the whole time, whereas Cedric was intervening at just the right points to get him to the graveyard.

** Cedric becoming a Death Eater for losing the TWT is one of the things that made me consider Cursed Child as non-canon. It's basically ignoring everything we learn about Cedric in the book(s).

Outside of changing the character from the ground up in ways resembling the worst bashfics, or putting him under some kind of Super-Imperius Curse levels of mind control, there's just no way.

*** The way I see it it wasn't a case of 'oh man that wasn't fair KILL SMASH CURSE' it was a slow process if being open to manipulation. Cedric was a handsome popular jock. It's easy to be good when the world favours you. I see the CC alt verse as when he'd had perhaps the first really big experience where being a popular jock doesn't help and that was the START not cause of his going dark.

It's exactly what you're looking for, it's about how he becomes a death eater and it's completed.
