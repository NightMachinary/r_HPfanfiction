Are there any interesting and somewhat realistic SI stories out there? I'm tired of the SI ending up in love with one of the characters, it feels so... wish fulfillment-y. Which I understand might be an odd complaint, considering that's what a lot of SI's are normally for, but I don't know, I never been a fan of suddenly be in love with Remus or Sirius, if in Marauder Era, or suddenly in love with Harry, Draco, Hermione, Ginny or someone else.

Fine with female SI's, and male SI's. They can be in a romance, but I don't want it to be a major thing.

They can either tell someone that they're from a different world/time, or they can hide it, I don't really care either way.

I want them to struggle with being in a different place/time, not them easily being able to destroy Horcruxes, defeating bad guys like Umbridge, getting Sirius out of Azkaban, et cetra. Like they can do those things, but I want them to actually struggle with those things, not have it easy.

Also don't have them remember EVERY single thing from the books, even as a mega fan, someone would surely forget something, it'd make it more real if they let certain things happen that happened in canon, as well as forgetting certain things that happened in canon.

This doesn't need to happen, but it'd be pretty fun seeing the SI make comparisons to the real characters, compared to the books and/or movies, seeing the real characters actually better or worse then they imagined,et cetra.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Would rather it be completed, but if not that's fine.

As I said, I'm fine with a male SI or a female SI. The SI could be a new "character" or they could be self inserted as an already existing character, either is fine.

Although it'd also be interesting if a character died and was reincarnated as another character, with knowledge of what's going to happen. (If there's any stories like that?).

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

  Ever dream of ending up in your favorite book? Think that sounds pretty awesome? Well you're wrong. Time travel sucks, alternate dimensions suck, and trying to raise young wizards without getting yourself killed and accidentally letting the bad guys win really sucks. But getting to give a kid the childhood he needs? Well, that just might make it worth it.

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.
