It's eldritch horror, i believe like 30k ish words, set with Harry in Azkaban and the slow deterioration of his mental state and the world.

Lots of spooky stuff, escaped Death Eater, in a world where he failed against Umbridge.

This sound familiar to anyone?

  The crumbling island prison of Azkaban has been evacuated, its remaining prisoners left behind. Time growing short, Harry Potter will make one final bid for freedom, enlisting an unlikely crew of allies in a daring escape, where nothing is as it seems.

** Yes. It was amazingly well written, though I can't recall the title either :( I remember i googled something like Harry potter fanfiction lovecraft, and found it through a reddit post.
