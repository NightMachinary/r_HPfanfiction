** Do you remember anything else about the Plot? We all take different things from the works we read, so if you know pairing or anything else it might help narrow it down.

** Shit. I swear I just read this no more than a month ago. I'm looking.

Edit: It's not HP and the Veil of Mystery, like I thought it was. Now I don't know. I really should organize my bookmarks.

** Could it be: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8215565/1/Knowledge-is-Useful-But-Power-is-Power][Knowledge is Useful But Power is Power]] by DisobedienceWriter? It's what I thought of as soon as I read your post but I read it so long ago I can't remember if the book Dumble's wrote is called anything or not. If not, it made it on my "check to see if its ever updated list" so it musta been a good read.

** I'm pretty sure I just read this not long ago. The book is all about having style in a duel. Let me see if it's in my recent alerts.

Edit: Sadly, it's not, but I'm pretty sure I know the story you're talking about.
