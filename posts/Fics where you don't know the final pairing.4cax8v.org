I prefer non-slash, Harry-centric, and I'm not looking for harem stories. Just something where there's more than one possible girl Harry might pursue, and we as the readers don't know which one it'll be. If there's anything like this, please let me know. Thanks!


** In this one Harry flirts with several girls and teases a lot of relationships that just refuse to happen.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway, yet miraculously he lives. Even so, the question of how remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

** linkffn(6988455). The After Years. Only completed fic I can think of. It is completely relationship focused and a bit mushy. I'd have something to say about the ending, too, but I don't want to spoil it.

  (Post-war) One witch 7 years his junior, one witch his own age, and one witch 7 years his senior. All vying for Harry Potter's affections. Who will win out? (Not harem, but possible sexual situations/lemons) (All credit to abovethestars@TDA for the banner)
