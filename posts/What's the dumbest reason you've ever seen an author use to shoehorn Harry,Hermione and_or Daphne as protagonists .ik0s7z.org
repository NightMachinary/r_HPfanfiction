** *Daphne*

Any Daphne fic where her mother and Lily are BFF's/Mrs. Greengrass is Harry's godmother. There are much better ways to introduce a character.

Marriage Contract with Daphne - There are some good fics (see: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation][Contractual Invalidation]]), but most of these have terrible execution. One that I remember clearly is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12246163/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lightning-Lord][HP and the Lightning Lord]]. Their interaction is just... bad.

*Hermione*

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/][The Accidental Animagus]] - Don't get me wrong, the fic is pretty good. But Harry becomes a cat animagus and somehow ends up in Grangers house where they adopt him and Hermione becomes super important in the process? Fuck, no.

Any response to Reptilia28's challenge.

I have no idea where I read this, but there's some fic where Hermione is abused by her dad, she knew Sirius when she was a baby and saw him as a foster father, Sirius comes to London and visits her instead of Harry, James and Lily are alive (but trapped somewhere) and Hermione is some squib's daughter or something. Hermione is also an empath, some lioness animagus which she inherits from the Founders and saves the world with the author's knowledge of canon.

Quite a few fics where Lily talks to Harry (either in his dream, when he's hit by a Killing Curse or as a ghost) and tells him that she "chose" Hermione for him/Hermione is his soul mate.

** *Hermione AND Daphne*

I think it was one of these old challenge fic ("Don't fear the Reaper or something like that"). Harry is dead, his "Angel of Death" explains to him that the 2 girls are both his soul mates and that he must marry them, then send the 3 of them back in 4th year. It's interesting to note that, even in this fic, he had never interacted with Daphne before that.
