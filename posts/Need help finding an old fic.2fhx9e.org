Help! I am looking for an old fic.i think it takes place after OoP or DH. Lupin is gradually taking over the order, even if he doesn't realize it. He ends up going on an undercover werewolf mission and almost dies. He falls in love with Tonks. Arthur Weasley tells a clueless Lupin that he is running the Order and everyone looks up to and respects him ( where Lupin thinks they just tolerate him) Any help is appreciated!
