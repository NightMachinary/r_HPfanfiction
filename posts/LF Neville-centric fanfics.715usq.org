I guess many of you have seen the recent post on [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] about imagining the books from another character's point of view. Of course a certain fic that must not be named, written from Neville's point of view was massively praised and upvoted. The problem with that piece of grimdark drivel is that its protagonist is Neville in name only. Which is pretty frustrating since Neville is one of my favourite characters. So I'm looking for any Neville-centric fics with a good characterization, whether it's about his Hogwarts days, post-Hogwarts or as a teacher.


** I saw the post, along with the whole thread praising the fic-that-shall-not-be-named. That was kinda disheartening. linkffn(The Fine Art of Fine Print) has Neville as a secondary, fleshed out protagonist as a Professor at Hogwarts. I know it's not Neville-centric, but I really liked his portrayal in the story.

**** I read the first two chapters of DAYD and then skimmed over the rest. The writing doesn't feel British, it has an American tone (saying this as an American). Neville and the other characters don't feel like canon. There is brutal and unnecessary violence along with a misogynistic vibe.

***** I completely share your criticism. I also hate how it turns the DA into an actual army of child soldiers. Canon DA is more about civil disobedience, and preparing for a situation where they have to defend themselves, but not actively preparing for a massive battle.

*** Dumbldore's Army and the Year of Darkness. It claims to be a canon-compliant seventh year story from Neville's point of view, but it is grimdark drivel in my opinion.

Among its many flaws are over the top violence, characters acting wildly out of character, asinine plot, a permanent sense of misogyny, clich√©d writing of non-English characters and glorification of child soldiers.

And yet it is somehow a very popular fanfic.

** Smutty, but I enjoy Neville's characterization in Shayalonnie's linkao3(Safe Word is Devil's Snare). It's an NC-17 Neville/Hermione Marriage Law fic with a dom/sub relationship. Mild background slash, and if I remember correctly canon is fudged so that Sirius, Fred, Remus, etc. are alive...

**** That's fair.

For context for those who might be interested, the bill/law comes about because of an increase in Squib births/decrease in the magical population following the war that Hermione as an Unspeakable works to find a solution for. The idea is that magical compatibility increases likelihood of magical births, and that an aging (and therefore exempt) Wizengamot pushes those of marrying age into finding suitable partners by employing an old spell that allows people to see their own magical compatibility with others in the room during an initial period of people volunteering for the program. She and Neville match, but also choose each other, then later the bill becomes more enforced and she works harder to find a solution to help various friends from being forced to marry and procreate. Throughout the story, others flout the purpose of the law by faking compatibility with people that they want to marry, hoping that an increase in magical births by others might give them some cover.

Edit for additional clarity.
