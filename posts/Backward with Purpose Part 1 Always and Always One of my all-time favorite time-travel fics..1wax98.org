*** The author was still active on fanfiction.net until about 6 months ago and added on a few notes to the end of part 1, but unfortunately it does seem to be abandoned :( Which is a shame because it seems like a great story. I read the series a few months ago and remembered a few days ago about it and decided to share it on here. I agree the second is better (and that's saying a lot considering the first was really good as well) it is somehow even more complex then the first story.

**** I dislike the second part because it makes the first irrelevant, destiny based.

** One of the best ever in the fandom.

And Ella (the author) is a classy lady. I hope she's still writing, wherever she is.

** I agree, it is great! It was very well thought out especially with how part 2 played in. The author put a lot of work into creating such a complex but easy to follow story.

** One of the few older time travel stories that still holds up. It's a shame the third one was never finished. That said, the first two stories were worth reading anyways.

** This is probably my favorite time-travel fic. I love it, and the sequel is extremely well-plotted as well.

*** Have you read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past][Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past]]? Its one of my other all-time favorite Harry Potter fanfics, unfortunately I think it has been abandoned since it hasn't been updated in over a year.

***** I agree with you. It's more emotional, and, you know, actually finishes. And it's less depressing, though capture a full range of emotion.

**** I'd say it's more like half-abandoned. I don't think the author has actually abandoned it, it's just that he has an incredibly slow update rate. The most recent chapter was posted with a 2.5 year gap between it and the previous. So don't give up hope entirely, but you'll have to be really patient.

***** That's reassuring. I recently read through it again and in a lot of his author notes it gave the impression that he was updating quite frequently. However, now that you mention it I think I do recall as the story got closer to the end he did mention getting more busy and not having as much time to devote to the story.

*** Yes!!! Yes!! Three times yes!!

I'm glad I'm not the only one who wanted to kill someone when they planned to release the basilisk all over again.

I mean: If you weren't going to change the first two years "because certain things have to happen", then why bother redoing them?? You might as well jump straight to the point Peter Pettigrew escapes and interfere from there on out.

**** Well, it does explain that they needed to bring forth the sword of Gryffindor and make sure that it absorbed basilisk venom. It was that combination which turned it into a weapon capable of destroying horcruxes.

***** I can think of a dozen ways to solve this problem that doesn't revolve around letting a 60 foot basilisk loose in a castle of children. I mean seriously: just take Dumbledore down there and let a rooster crow a few times. BAM! basilisk dead, the end. You can always preserve its poison anyway if you really need it.

They don't know what no one will die this time! Last time it was a ridiculously lucky break that all victims just happened to be watching it indirectly and no one died. How can they possible know it will happen again this time around? I bet they won't feel so smart if Hermione really gets killed this time.

And what is his big plan this time? To have another sword fight with a basilisk?

Besides, if they so desperately want events in the first and second year to be exactly the same, then why did they bother redoing them at all? they could just skip straight to third year and stop Peter Pettigrew then. The only difference is that Percy is slightly less of a jerk. Yeah, that's worth unleashing a basilisk over!

*** I just finished re-reading this story, and have realized that this criticism is even more unwarranted than I had initially thought. Throughout that offending section (which is only one part of a much longer story) it is explained that Dumbledore, with his full access to the Hogwarts wards and knowledge of what was going on, was able to ensure that the student body was kept away from the basalisk while it was free. Only two students were petrified, because they managed to resist Dumbledore's repelling charm. During the next appearance of the snake, Dumbledore discusses the much stronger wards that he is using to contain the beast. The logic of this section is completely in line with the story as a whole.
