Is this a thing? This should be a thing. Dueling champion or transfiguration professor, who seems like the better choice to fight a dark wizard? How would this affect creature rights? Would Flitwick become headmaster? If so, would he mess up Riddle like Albus did? Who would Headmaster!Flitwick hire? I NEED THIS TO BE A THING...^{please^{prettyplease}}


** Was he even old enough?

**** Probably younger than Dumbledore and Dumbledore was an unbelievable prodigy with Gellart being his near equal on top of having the Elder Wand and he still had quite a few years on him (he was like 64). It's hard to say how old he was based on merely the fact that he asked the Gray Lady something some time before Tom did.

***** And maybe they are born from the earth like the Uruk-hai in LOTR.

I think it would be a neat AU for Flitwick to defeat Grindewald. It would probably be huge for halfbreed acceptance. Maybe he goes the political route though and becomes the Minister?
