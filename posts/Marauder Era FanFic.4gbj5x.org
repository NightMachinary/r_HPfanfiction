I read and loved the Life and Times and am looking for another Marauder Era fanfic, hopefully with a large amount of Jily banter and a strong plot.


** If you like the Life and Times, my first suggestion would be ByeByeBirdie's Tears on the Balcony trilogy. It's very James/Lily-centric, with Sirius/OC and Remus/OC thrown in. It can be overly wordy at times, but all three are still incredible.\\
linkffn(Tears on the Balcony)\\
linkffn(Kisses on the Balcony)\\
linkffn(Goodbyes on the Balcony)

Another good J/L fic is linkffn(Buried Treasure and Transmogrify). I like it because it's a little more....I guess raunchy would be the right word?

This one is still a work in progress, but it's really good as well. linkffn(An Unexpected Attraction by NJRM)

This one is a fairly new work in progress that I'm keeping up with. I really like the premise of it. linkffn(The Bet by Auntleona0)

Lastly, I'm going to throw in a bonus Sirius/OC fic that has a little bit of James/Lily in the background. I literally just read it yesterday, and it's one that will frustrate you and give you all the feels at the same time. This is the original from the POV of the OC linkffn(Nobody Sees Me Wishing by solitaireclay07) and then there's the companion piece from Sirius's POV, linkffn(Suddenly I See by solitaireclay07)

These are just the ones that are coming to me at the moment!

  Lily Evans has spent years despising James Potter. He has spent just as long worshiping her. When seventh year pairs them Head Boy and Girl, each comes to realize that their judgment isn't quite what they thought it was. This is the same story that was over on Checkmated, but I completed it here. Prequel to Heroes for Ghosts. Warning: this story is a strong M rating.

  3 years after Hogwarts, James and Lily are back with old and new friends by their side. Their lives are motivated by fear, their world surrounded by immense danger. As they each fight for their lives and for their loved ones in a world centered around Voldemort, the struggle to survive the war against him is nothing compared to the struggle to survive the wars within themselves.

  Ivy Bennett was that girl eyeing Sirius Black during their Defense Against the Dark Arts exam. She didn't mean to do it - in fact, she doesn't even like Sirius in that way. She was glad that he never noticed her. Well, in a way...

  Lily Evans in no way fancied James Potter, that was a fact. The pair becoming friends was shock enough but Lily having an actual crush on him? Hell would have to freeze over first...at least that's what she thought.

  There's just something about James Potter that always causes Lily to make the worst decisions. That's probably how she ends up throwing away a month of her seventh year on a bet with a boy she can hardly stand. A story of growing up, identity, and falling in love.

** I can't recommend this enough. Not really JxL centric, but really strong plot and very well written imo.
