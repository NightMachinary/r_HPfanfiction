  Well, this started off me exploring the idea of genderbent Weasleys - a bunch of badass Weasley women. Somehow it turned into exploring Ron instead. Names: Either Willow or Wilma, Billie for short. Charlotte, Charle for short. Persis, Felicia(Felix) and Gwen, Rhonda, and Reginal (Gin).

** I only know of dead fics. The most prominent one was where Harry went to Azkaban and unknowingly cursed Ron, who turned into a girl and also ended up as part of Harry's harem. Most Ron genderbending starts off with him as a girl, rather than becoming one.

** Why would anyone want to read a fic about Ron turning into a man?

*** I sort of get the joke, but at the same time I don't. It's a strange feeling.

**** I think it's because if Ron turned into a girl, then OP used the wrong pronouns.

** I can only remember a HP/HG bashing fic with the obvious tropes, love potions, and evul dumbledore, possibly time travel. He tries to use a potion on HG and get's castrated and left hanging somewhere by harry or dobby can't really remember. Anyway, I think he get's obliviated, the W family have to move somewhere middle easter I think and gets renamed. Can't remember the name tho'

Something similar happens to malfoy in another story, something like castration because it made sense by the plot, barely. Get's a sex change with a ritual, then obliviated and goes back as malfoy's sister. I thing he, now she, ended up dating ron? Something like that.
