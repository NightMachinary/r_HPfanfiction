Alright so it's just like the title says. I really want to read a fic where Harry is in Gryffindor and Draco and his friends are in Slytherin, yet Harry is still friends with Draco and his group. Ron and Hermione could also be friends or not I do not mind. Ships are cool to just preferably no slash and please just don't have the ship be the main focus of the story. Can take place any year, and while I would prefer Harry siding with Voldemort if the fic goes into the war years it's cool if he doesn't. Hell having a fic with Harry being friends with Draco despite them swing on opposite sides of the war and neither of them switching yet still being friends would be super cool as well. Just yeah, something like what I just ranted about would be great to read!
