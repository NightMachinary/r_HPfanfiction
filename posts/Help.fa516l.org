:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic that has Newt as a magical creature animagus that helps Grindlewald, I think Newt was either a Zeuwu or a dragon I am not quite sure but am leaning more towards a Zeuwu, if that is how you spell it, but I think it also could have been a Newt/Grindlewald. Thank you!
