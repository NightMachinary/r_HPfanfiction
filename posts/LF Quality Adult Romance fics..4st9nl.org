By adult i mean /BOTH/ parties of the featured pairing are adults engaging in adult activities but not necessarily a smut fic. I can allow Teenage relationships that have adult themes but any year below 6th year, or 5th year depending on how mature it is, is off the table.

By Quality i mean, well just use your definition of quality romance. Effectiveness of the relationship, characterization, pacing, writing quality etc. I'm very flexible with the plot as long as it doesn't neglect the romance, hell the plot could might as well be the relationship of the pairing and i'd be ok with that.

Absolutely no time travels, slashes and relationships with wide age gaps even if both parties are adults. Oh and no Dramoines(no offense to the people who ship them).

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

** Of course, there are the following:

I personally preferred linkffn(Thresholds by Stanrick). In that, there's more of a progression and the inherent story seems more coherent.

However, his other story linkffn(Favorite Things by Stanrick) has better characterisation. It's short but sweet and it's purely romance.

  When a young green-eyed wizard and a minimally older brown-eyed witch, the best of friends for years, discover their mutual fondness for one particular armchair in front of one particular fireplace, it can inevitably mean one thing and one thing only: War. And then also -- eventually, potentially -- something else. Maybe. But first it's definitely war.

  Most people tend to assume they'll wake up exactly where they fall asleep, and usually they have good reason to do so. For someone, however, even that simple certainty stops being a given one strange night, when quite surprisingly he does in fact not wake up where he fell asleep. And that is only the beginning of what will be one most unusual week in the life of Harry Potter.

6th year, Harry/Hermione. Focus is on the growth of their relationship (which does not jump into things, despite the title). And it is a new relationship, as it's Harry's first year at Hogwarts (very AU). Long, but no chapter cliffhangers, so pretty easy to read a chapter at a time.

** I linked to these companion fics in another thread, but since they are my absolute favorites and meet your requirements, why not?

These are two Snape/Hermione stories with actual plots and pacing that builds their relationship through believable events and keeps them both in character. Post-Hogwarts, so Hermione is an adult. There are lemons eventually.
