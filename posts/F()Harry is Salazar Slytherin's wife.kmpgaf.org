I haven't read this one, I saw the description on ao3 and it looked interesting but now I can't find it. From what I remember from the description:

No one knows much about Slytherin's wife. Harry Potter (i think its fem harry, but not entirely sure) disappeared after the war with voldemort. One of the last descendants of Slytherin decides to publish Slytherin's journal before a court and it reveals that Harry Potter is Slytherin's wife. I'm pretty sure Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw were in a relationship too.

Thanks

Edit: nvm, I had it open in another tab! Its called The Wife of Slytherin
