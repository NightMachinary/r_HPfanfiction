It was a Hermione x Sirius where Hermione's soul was transported to Hermione Potter, James sister. I don't remember a lot but Dumbledore revealed to James parents that Hermione wasn't really their daughter. She was kicked out and I think she also removed the trace on her so she won't be found by the potters. I would really appreciate it if someone can find it.
