So, I'm looking for fics that do Character Development really well - where characters change and grow from one thing to another over the course of the story. Any character is fine, and any arc is cool with me - can be corruption or redemption, Neville-esque confidence kicks, mortal-to-god, or whatever else: bitterness, heroism, love, murderous-ness. They just have to finish the story as something different than what they started as.

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking. Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

And hell, a little discussion too - what do you think makes a good character development arc? Or a bad one? And is character development even needed? I'm curious to read your thoughts. :)

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Maybe too mainstream and overhyped fic but I f*cking love Draco arc from Methods of Rationality where Harry "corrupting" him to the light side.

My second favorite is Tracey. I try to bot spoil everything so here's stripped down version: she got lecture "you are ambitious but lack any real ambitions", started "collecting ambitions" and became undescribably entertaining character. Fan group who started crowdfunding campaign to print the fic (yep, that was was a thing. And surprisingly successful thing) called themselves "Tracey Davis fund". This how enjoyable her character has become despite/thanks to her rare appearence.

But the whole fic is full of little satisfying character arc like this.

Out of little ones I love how Snape slowly reavaluate his life and realise that he is basically sabotaging Slytherin (and that Dumbledore made him head of the house for this exact reason).

Dumbledore and Quirrel is the perfect example for discussing your question "does character need a character arc" since during the story both doesn't really change enough to qualify for arc. But both got so much character development behind the stage that they are incredibly interesting and deep character who are always interesting to watch and always can surprise you by revealing new side (while staying consistent). I couldn't figure out which tag can be applied to Dumbledore of this AU untill the end of the fic.

And of course I cannot ignore elephant in the room and not discuss the reason why people either love the fic or hate passionately.

This version of Harry is completely different. He is a young genius raised by an Oxford proffessor and ready to "crack" magic with science.

On the upside he has a lot of interesting things to say that are actually worth thinking about and considering. Plus he is an interesting and entertaning flawed character.

On the downside: his flaws is... he is an arrogant little prick and elitist.

Don't get me wrong it's regularly bite him in the ass and author regularly make fun it while he gradually change for a better. And even the jerkiest parts may be extremly entertaining to read

For example:

This Harry thinks Quidditch is bloody stupid since snitch is ruining the game.

But by the end we get perfectly reasonable explanation why things are like they are

#+begin_quote
  At first Anna had been gratified to see the final Quidditch Cup go on so long - as a Gryffindor she was a bystander at the House Cup thing, it wasn't like Gryffindor ever won. In contrast, last year's World Cup of Quidditch, to which her family had bought some very expensive tickets, had been over in ten minutes which was awful. Modern Quidditch games had become too short, the Snitch caught much too quickly. It was a widely-talked problem among aficionados: broomstick enchantments had advanced, while the Snitch stayed the same regulation speed, with the result that Quidditch games had become shorter and shorter. At professional levels the sport of Quidditch had been reduced to a contest of who had the deepest pockets for their Seeker's experimental racing broom, and the rest of the players might as well have been watching from the stands.

  Everyone knew something had to be done, the situation had been getting worse for centuries and now it was intolerable. But the International Confederation of Wizards' Quidditch Committee was mired in all the usual acrimony of the I.C.W., screaming disputes between Germans and Bulgarians, and somehow nobody could agree on exactly how to fix the rules. To Anna the correct course seemed obvious, just make the Snitch fast enough to restore the four-hour or five-hour games of the early nineteenth century and the Golden Age of Quidditch. Except the Belgians thought the duration of a professional game should be two hours like in La Belle Ã‰poque when Belgium had dominated Quidditch, and the lunatic Italians wanted to go back to the week-long Quidditch games of the fourteenth century, and Britain's even crazier blood purists kept on talking up the occasional day-long Quidditch match as proof that broomsticks couldn't really have improved since everything was better in the old days

MOR-Harry's POV?

#+begin_quote
  Harry politely asked a Hufflepuff witch sitting next to him, and another Hufflepuff sitting one row above him, if they could move aside. Then Harry drew forth from his pouch a huge scroll, and unfurled it into a 2-meter-tall banner which stuck in place in midair. The enchantment had been done courtesy of a sixth-year Ravenclaw who had a reputation for knowing less about Quidditch than Harry did. In huge, glowing purple letters, the sign read:

  JUST BUY A CLOCK

  Beneath it was a Snitch, with a blinking red X over it
#+end_quote

And skipping some hillarious spoilers (how Slytherin and Ravenclaw exploited the rules)...

#+begin_quote
  Almost nobody remaining in the stands was paying attention either, since everyone who'd remained in the stadium seemed to have discovered a new and more interesting sport, the debate about how to amend the House Cup rules and/or Quidditch. The argument had become heated to the point where all of the nearby Professors were barely keeping order at a level short of open combat. This argument, unfortunately, had considerably more than two factions. Some darned busybodies were proposing sensible-sounding alternatives to eliminating the Snitch entirely, and this was threatening to split the vote and sap the momentum for reform.

  In retrospect, Harry thought, it would have been nice to have Draco unfurl his own banner from the Slytherin side saying 'SNITCHES ARE AWESOME', to set the polarity of the debate. Harry had squinted over at the Slytherin section earlier, but he hadn't been able to spot Draco anywhere in the stands. Severus Snape, who could also have been sympathetic enough to play the villainous opposition, was likewise nowhere to be seen...
#+end_quote

So this Harry being written like this is a deliberate choice that brings some of the most hillarous highlights and a ton of material for character development (that he has)

But it's very unobvious at the start.

Too unobvious...

So there is a big amount of people who started reading MOR and thought it's just a fic all about self-insert-all-knowing-Harry telling everyone why original is stupid (which is not). And that fic was oriented at [[/r/iamverysmart][r/iamverysmart]] arrogant idiots (it kinda is) and not worth reading (with all of my passionate love to the fic I can say that it's amazing and definitely worth reading)

So I recommend just accept this take on Harry and enjoy the fic. It has a lot to offer. And the further it gets the better it becomes.

** I'm not entirely sure it counts, but I thought I'd throw it out there since you mentioned bitterness. In Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus, she seems to be being consumed by tiredness(?) and the character development deals a lot with expectations, free will, and her own morality. I would say the shift really started after the trauma in her first year, but it hasn't been completed yet. Its perhaps less obvious and the fic is very absurdist, but I think it's well done. You mentioned human to god and in some ways it's an inversion of that.

** Ayyy, a wild self-promoter appeared! Haha, I'm happy to answer any follow-up questions, but I'll try to speak to your points in my summary.

I'm co-writing a fic right now where character development is quite literally our main interest. Characters have already changed and grown and we're not even a fourth of the way through what we have planned for the series... We're currently nearing the end of book 1 of 4. It's mostly gen angst/tragedy & mystery, with a sprinkle of romance here and there. Split POV, canon-divergent, no smut whatsoever. Eventual mentor/adoption Snape but currently he's an asshole (this won't completely go away, but at least he won't be /as much/ of an asshole lol). Large cast of characters, many of whom are OCs.

Uhhh I think that's the rundown? Lemme know if you've any questions. But if you're interested, you can find it on both ffnet and ao3. The latter has chapter images. :)

#+begin_quote
  Terror and destruction seemed inevitable after Voldemort finally revealed himself to the Wizarding World but, at Hogwarts, Harry lives a disturbingly unchanged life. He exists in parallel to the people around him and, as time passes, the line between friend and foe stretches into a complex gradient, difficult to decipher. Seeking desperately to become the hero the Order needs, it becomes more and more clear to him how dangerous that prospect is.But, in a life fraught with crisis and tragedy, what's just a little more?
