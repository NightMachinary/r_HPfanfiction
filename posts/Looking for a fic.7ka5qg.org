One where harry is sick of waiting for Voldemort to die, and he inherited the black family magic, so he gets himself caught by death eaters then kilos voldemort, Dumbledore not happy with this. But snape can sense the power shift so I think takes him on as his apprentice to protect him and introduces him to â€˜the bar' who all pitch in and train him is a slash at end between snape and harry any help would be appreciated
