Having just accidentally read what turned out to be six hundred pages of fic in one sitting for the first time in years, my passions have been reignited!

I'm looking for stories in the same vein as "an old and new world" by LensOfSanity (sadly removed from the authors page), "Harry Johnson and the headmasters socks" by doghead thirteen, and that sort of ilk.

I'm looking for violence, humor, and a touch of madness, so bring it on!


** /An Old and New World/ was actually the first thing I thought of when I read your title. You've probably read /A Black Comedy/? I'd also hesitantly recommend /Gryffindors Never Die/ by ChipmonkOnSpeed.

*** I love everything ChipmunkOnSpeed has published! Prodigy is right up my alley too, and actually got me interested in some of the police procedurals it's crossed over with.

** Well, you might also want to try linkffn(The Dark Lord's Equal) since its also by Lens of Sanity.

The Prisoner's Cipher linkffn(The Prisoner's Cipher) checks the violence and madness buttons so hard the pen went through the paper, though its not humorous.

Seventh Horcrux linkffn(Seventh Horcrux) also seems to meet all your requirements. This one is arguably the most popular comedy in the fandom, possibly next to A Black Comedy.

Most of nonjon's works fit with your requirements as well.

The-Boy-Who-Could-Not-Die linkffn(The-Boy-Who-Could-Not-Die) is unfinished, but its one of the freshest takes on Horcrux!Harry I can remember.

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED

  AU. Years after his defeat of Voldemort, Harry Potter remains a willing and secret prisoner of the Ministry, but not all is what it seems. Harry has a plan, and the world will never be the same.

  At seven, Harry stumbles out of the car crash that killed his uncle despite the fact he should be dead. It is at this moment that he discovers that, unless a very specific weapon is used, he cannot suffer injury, he cannot feel pain, and he cannot die. Harry proceeds to abuse the hell out of this. A lot. Black comedy, dark, some bloody scenes, Harry/Ginny eventually

*** Doghead Thirteen's new story "The scourge from the north" on the Caer Azkaban yahoo group. It's only four mega-chapters and two parts of a fifth long, and was very hard to find but my god. It's already so long, so good, and so refreshing I love it! I finally found it late one evening and started reading and then noticed the sun was coming up by the time I'd just about finished. I can point you in the direction of yahoo group, or if you'd like link you to a Google Drive folder with all of it in there.

I'll stick the two parts of chapter 5 that have been posted into a word doc and stick them in there as soon as I can. These are HTML documents while you'll have to do is open them up in any browser
