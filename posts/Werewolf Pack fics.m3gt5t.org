Does anyone know any fics like:

linkao3(Alpha by LunasWufei) or

linkffn(Pack Mentality by LadyLombax) ?

Completed fics only, any pairing is okay. Thanks in advance!


** linkao3(All the Young Dudes) as a werewolf pack sideplot with a big focus on how the pack dynamic works. It's really interesting and my favourite part of the story.

It's not the main focus of the story though and doesn't really come in till 5th year I think if i remember correctly.

â€‹

linkao3(Break by K1toftheworthies) isn't a 'pack' story but does focus a lot on how werewolves are treated in society. Which is badly, incase you didn't know.

Sorry if theyre not what you're looking for.

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise! PLEASE DO NOT COPY TO WATTPAD. SERIOUSLY, WHY??

  Sirius is in Azkaban and Remus, for want of a better option, is getting on with his life. Sirius can only remember the worst parts of his life and Remus can only continue trying to live his, but eventually their separate threads must collide.*complete* (at last!)

*** I second that the werewolf culture in all the young dudes is great but I will say that it's a very long fic and it's more a side plot

  Or why the Wizarding World doesn't know everything about werewolves and neither does Remus. Therefore when things change in POA, Harry is left to deal with the werewolf and everyone is left confused except Moony.
