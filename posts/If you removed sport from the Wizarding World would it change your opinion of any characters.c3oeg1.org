I'm convinced half the issue people have with certain characters is that they remind them of sporty people at school that they disliked rather than anything based in canon. Just from occasional comments on threads here.


** I would say Oliver Wood. Considering this character doesnt seem to exist outside of Quidditch. Same for the Trio of chasers even if I guess you can technically introduce them by Fred and George.

** Haha, I feel called out because of my comment about James in the other thread now.

But no, I don't think it would. Well, maybe about Cormac McLagen of Flint, because without quidditch, they simply wouldn't have a reason to appear in the books at all. But most sporty characters are positive and don't even fall under 'jock' stereotype: Harry, all the Weasleys, Cedric, Cho. I love Oliver Wood, and you cannot go more sporty than Oliver.

If anything, I would add more sport in the Wizarding World. They all follow quidditch, but only seven people from each house play. If I were a witch, I wouldn't want to play quidditch competitively or even for a house team (I'm attached to my limbs too much), but I would love flying and play just for fun occasionally.

*** Maybe they just didn't come up, but yeah. We had intramural and pickup games galore in high school. The only things that were school teams only let everyone in, like cross country.

Muggleborns are definitely playing football.

** I guess it would make Ludo Bagman a complete loss as a human being.
