A wild trip to a Monte Carlo casino reveals that Harry has an impenetrable poker face. He just doesn't care whether he has total crap or a royal flush.

The Romanian Dragon Reserve provokes minimal reaction. Turns out dragons establish dominance by playing games of chicken; even when being charged by a titanic Hungarian Horntail, Harry stands his ground without flinching. The dragons run away from him after that.

Voldemort gets tired of trying to kill him (and visiting his mind is just horridly boring), and instead pays to send his nemesis to counseling. It's no fun having a snake face when your enemy can't be bothered to be terrified of it.


** "Imagine being in Hufflepuff. I'd leave, wouldn't you?" said the blond boy next to Harry in Madam Malkins.

"No," said Harry. He didn't bother to ask Hagrid what the boy had been talking about, and got back to his miserable home with no more idea about Hogwarts than he'd started with.

On the day of the First, Hagrid had to come and fetch Harry again, since he'd missed the train entirely and people were looking for him. "My fault," Hagrid said. "I should 'a known yer wouldn' know how ter catch the train." He walked Harry to a very large castle, through a thick oak door studded with iron nails, and along a stone corridor to a Great Hall full of staring people and thousands of floating candles.

"Here he is," Hagrid said. "Safe and sound. Go on Harry, go and join the others." He gave Harry a bit of a nudge.

Harry joined other children, all taller than he was, all wearing black robes like the ones Harry had scrambled into before he climbed into the flying motorcycle.

"You're just in time," said a stern witch in green tartan. "Potter, Harry. Come forward and put the hat on so you can be sorted."

Harry put it on, and heard an inquisitive sound from inside the hat, followed by some soft snoring. After a long pause, the hat said "Mm? Oh. Yes. HUFFLEPUFF!" The last word was shouted.

Harry handed back the hat and went to the table that matched the colour his badge had just turned into. The house of Badgers, all applauding madly to see him join them.

"We've got Harry Potter!" They were all so much more excited by this than Harry was. He smiled politely, seeing no need to be nasty about things.

Given the mountains of food that turned up after a very odd speech, Harry thought Hogwarts was probably going to be an okay experience. Lots of nonsense, but nobody was trying to bash his face in. He'd take it.

Very modest, people said Harry was. Polite. Kept himself to himself.

Dumbledore eyed the boy who didn't seem worried about anything and went over old memories. He was worried about Harry. Very worried indeed.

And meanwhile the centaurs were predicting that the weather would be somewhat unsettled with a south-westerly wind and highs of twelve to thirteen Celsius and that everything would probably be fine, really.

**** It's a reference to centaurs being good at Divination in the Harry Potter books. Firenze and Madragorian and so on.

This time instead of Mars grows bright, it's just weather.
