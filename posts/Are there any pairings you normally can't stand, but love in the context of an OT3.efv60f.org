#+end_quote

Sorry for jumping into this conversation late, but I want to mention that the plot idea of Voldemort only having feelings for Harry because he is a horcrux is fairly common in HP/LV fics. It works in stories that explore unhealthy relationship dynamics between the two characters. (In those stories Voldemort usually starts out as controlling, narcissistic, etc.) I can recommend a few fics if you'd be interested in reading something of that sort.

#+begin_quote
  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain.

Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

** I love Fregermione(for lack of a better name, open to suggestions) Like I don't really enjoy Hermione/any weasley(except ron in canon, but def not in fanfiction), but the ones I've read that are Hermione/twins were effing great and had some really creative smut.

Also, not a OT3, but a OT4: I'm down for any SS/HG anytime and really enjoy DM/HG, and never really cared for LM/HG (actually hating it some), BUT DAMN, someone put those four together in one fanfic and it was a masterpiece! Pure smut tho

*** Hermione/random death eater I also don't like, but some of the best fanfics I've read(like some of the best written ones) were SS/HG or DM/HG(whichever you prefer). They were very organic and beautiful, and a lot of people that don't enjoy those ships loved them. I wouldn't give up on those otps hahah But I understand why it wouldn't be someone's cup of tea
