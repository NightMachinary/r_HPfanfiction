I prefer post-DH fics and would like to find some more good "8th book" fics that follow Harry and Ron as they become Aurors and chase down remaining Death Eaters and the like. I've only come across a few that are any good.

Recommendations?

Here's one someone recommended a while back in a thread I started. The story is mostly centered on Harry training an OC, with Ron (and Neville) playing some supporting roles. It's probably the most interesting depiction I've seen of what the Auror's Office might look like after the Second Wizarding War, and it really gets into the gritty details of what being an Auror involves.

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon... Winner of Mugglenet's Quicksilver Quill Awards 2016, Best Post-Hogwarts.

  After the fall of Voldemort, Harry makes a dumb career choice and Ron tags along. Hermione, sensibly, doesn't. Seven years later, a very different trio are drawn into an international web of intrigue by a little girl and an old relic. Lesson to be learned: stay in school, kids. Post-DH; Slightly AU. Rated M for language and violence. Not slash.

  Butchered unicorns in London's alleys, witches and wizards vanishing throughout Britain, and murmurs of a rising Dark Lord! With all of this, Senior Auror Ron Weasley can't believe Harry thought it a grand time to take a desk job. He'd always known the bloke was barmy, but embracing bureaucracy? ---Auror mystery, Harry-Ron friendship, and canon ships.
