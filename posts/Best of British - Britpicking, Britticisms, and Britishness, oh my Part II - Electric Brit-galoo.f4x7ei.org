So, I've noticed some more British-confusions and thought another thread was best to remedy them! This time, it was over the British School System. Prefects, Houses, House Points, Head Girl/Boys - they're all a real thing. Not just magic culture. My shitty near-failing small-town Secondary School had all of them, as did my A-Level College. Oh, and Boarding Schools are a thing, but they're really uncommon (130 Boarding Schools of 33000 pre-Uni schools in England, and most of those 130 also take day students as well as boarders).

Anyway, as with last time, what are things about British culture and general UK Society that you think would help a non-UK person write better fanfiction? And for those non-UK people, do you have any questions to ask? Any general resources of information or novels that you think show the right tone/environment, etc are also valid posts here. Or hell, any fics that you think get it right.

The two links above are there in case anything you want to ask was mentioned before. Feel free to check if you like, or just comment and risk repeating if you don't [:D]. I haven't seen any other threads do this kind of Britpicking Compilation since my last, but please post 'em below if you find 'em. The more centralised information the better - both for comprehensiveness and verification.


** What I'd really love to have is a master index of slang and idiomatic usage sorted by period (year or decade) and location, maybe with tags for class and subculture.

That way I could look up answers to questions like:

"What would a middleclass preteen in Surrey in 1991 say when he's bothered by something but not quite irate?"

*** The AO3 Writers group on Facebook is pretty helpful with this sort of thing. Some American will ask “What's British slang for ‘drunk'” or whatever, and then the Brits in the group will argue, and the word one Brit says is used by teens will be shot down by a Brit from some other part of Britain as being used only by old people, and I'll get the impression that it's really complicated and I should write only American characters from now on.

I came to the rather alarming realisation that 'mate' is used in a friendly way down South but is actually a threatening term up here. Whoops. (Pal, you want pal in Edinburgh.) Slang in Edinburgh is VERY different to London.

I also have to admit, I only know any of that because I write Life is Strange fanfiction and I was very confused when the characters (all living in Oregon) kept referring to Portland being in Oregon, when google clearly showed Portland was in Maine. Took me ages to find out there was one in Oregon as well. :D

I wouldn't call Americans stupid for not knowing anything about the rest of the world, though. Just ignorant or uneducated, and highly jingoistic. But that's a very Young British perspective - we may sing the National Anthem, but we do it ironically. :)

And you had supported the Gaiman's quote, because the first thing you mentioned about Czechia is something from our history. ;)

Yes, the term Czechia is still hotly contested, but if you live in the country named the Czech Republic (or the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland), then you have to have tendency to ignore Irish (everybody does it all the time anyway, unless you live in Belfast) and call your country Britain (or Czechia) quite often.

I knew 'poor person becomes royal' was a common trope - if it makes it to Disney, it's certainly a thing across European mythology at least - but a ploughman specifically is interesting. I imagine it's Kosmos living in a time when plagiarism was equivalent to citation - the more ideas you took from those who came before, the more of their authority you held, right?

But ah, Kosmas. The hardest ancient writer to explain to my non-nerd friends - I keep getting "Omg, there's a writer called Cosmo? That's so cool." type responses (if you weren't aware, there's a fruity vodka cocktail called a 'cosmopolitan' and the short form is 'cosmo') and it's become something of a meme within that friendship group now.

Fair, though, about the country length thing. I guess 'CR' (or whatever the appropriate initials would be for the Czech way of saying Czech Republic) doesn't roll off the tongue like 'The UK' does. :)

Ah, my apologies for the confusion, but the language question was based on what Czech people would call the Czech Republic. German people don't call Germany Germany, for instance. According to wikipedia, you call it 'Cesko'? (Apologies, my keyboard can't do the accents and special symbols).

The Kosmas part was me joking that it sounded similar to the name of a fruity alcoholic drink favoured by young women.

And yes, I did know that about Cosmas and Damian, actually. I believe I mentioned in another chat we were having (on Benthamite Utilitarianism) that I'm Irish-Italian and the majority of my relatives are Catholic. Learning the mythology (angels and saints and such) was non-optional. :D

I've also taken a lot of inspiration from various Christian stories and mythologies for my own works over the years, both actual Prose and for D&D games. The Extremes of Aristotelian Virtues make for fun elements of villainy. :)

Česko comprises three large regions: Morava (Moravia), Slezsko (Silesia), and them biggest of them is Čechy (in English, Bohemia), so Česko is the careful dancing around the distinction from Čechy (adjective “český”) so that Moravians are not offended)

****** Yep, In-Service Training days. In Scotland they just call it In-Service.

There's 5 in England (and Wales?) and 7 in Scotland. Usually the days are set by the local authority so the schedule varies from area to area. I /think/ academies and free schools can set their own, but don't quote me on it.

Some schools (mostly secondary) use "twilights" which is where pupils finish an hour or two early and the teachers stay later to reduce absence. Pretty sure a study showed it was actually worse than having days off.

Almost everywhere has INSET on the first day of the school year. My secondary put three of them at the start of the year and then twilights for the rest.

I have heard of an area that trialled INSET at the end of the year and then straight back to school but I suspect it may have be a "a friend of a friend" myth. I'd avoid the end of the year for fics.

Otherwise it tends to be tacked onto the end of a school holiday or bank holiday, less freauently its at the the start of the holiday or even just attached to a weekend.

I've only got knowledge of four local authorities, though.

If in doubt - September, either October (not relevent to Hogwarts) or January, April (Easter) and sometimes May.

**** UK system:

- State school. Paid for by taxation, free to attend.

- Independent schools. Paid for by fees.

- Public schools. A highly exclusive subset of independent schools now associated with the upper class, the oldest schools in the country.

The history behind the name "public school" is that prior to that time, you were basically educated by tutors or the church, neither of which were open to the general public. The public schools were the first schools where (in theory) anyone could attend, so long as they paid the fees.

Those schools are now associated with the upper class, but at the time of their foundation they were not designed to serve the aristocracy but rather the merchant class. For centuries the true upper class continued to tutor their children privately. It was only really in the Victorian era that the upper class started sending their children to school.

**** Public Schools in the UK officially refers to a group of originally seven schools which were allowed to be run exclusively by a board of governors (members of the 'public') as opposed to the crown, government or church. One of the original 7 was Eton, and they generally have the reputation of being for the aristocracy and upper classes. Private schools are schools that aren't funded by the government, I don't think they're necessarily fee paying, but most are. Lastly, state schools are funded fully by the government, though this comes with the caveat of not being allowed to set very strict entrance requirements.

There are a few other slight variations - for example state schools that receive a high enough OFSTED (like school inspectors) rating can be given academy status. An academy has more freedom with what it does, including the key stage 3 (year 7-9) curriculum, but it's expected to be more financially self sustaining. They still can't charge fees, but they can be funded by renting the grounds out to sports clubs and such after school hours, or by fundraising events.

******* Not quite true, failing schools are forcibly converted into academies. The go to "recommendation" for inadequete schools is to convert them to an academy.

Free schools (basically new academies) haven't been schools before. Both of these tend to be involved in chains/clusters of schools and frequently include money siphoned into the private sector.

In theory, they have more freedom than local authority schools - certainly they can easily choose a different model to letters and sounds. It is very difficult for them to operate a different curriculum because they're still assessed for KS1 outcomes. I knew a school that tried to do a play based curriclum but then the children aged 7 were expected to do written exams. (KS1 SATS are voluntary but lots of schools do them to get a good rating.)

I've also worked in two local authority schools who rent out their halls and such, admittedly neither had a gym to be rented out like a secondary academy I visted. Then again, I worked in primary.

When Harry started school, none of this was the case though. Grammar schools (schools you have to sit the 11+ to enter) were winding down. About half had closed, but its reasonable to assume that there is a purposeful distinction between Dudley going to a private (independent) school and Harry going to the local comprehensive which would be bottom rung in a place like Little Whinging.

As a side note: there's nothing actually wrong with mixed ability comprehensive and most of them are streamed by ability anyway.

*** They were originally public schools ie schools ordinary people could get their boys educated in as opposed to the nobs who educated at home with tutors.

During the Victorian era it got fashionable to send your posh kid so the schools were literally stolen from the poor and middling sort who were provided with inferior versions so the nobs could claim that they were not in breach of the founding charters of the schools, which were charitable in origin. They had the cheek to keep the name "public".

I can't remember if it's from Discworld, The History Boys or Witch Week but it's about PE or some sporting thing and the dude in charge says something like, "Any boy without his kit WILL PLAY IN HIS PANTS". Which sounds to me like a completely weird thing to say until I remember pants aren't trousers in whichever thing it is.

(A reverse example would be Plankton's weird pride in being college educated... everyone is! it's compulsory. Of course, that was before I knew Americans don't use college to refer to secondary school.)

It's funny, because that sort of britpicking is the one that is least important to me. It's usually the bigger ones that'd annoy me - using modern american slang, for instance, or everyone having a gun or the like.

I think the vocab bit of it comes from me reading the books in French originally - and so they were all translated anyways.

*** I did, though not overly regularly. I've never been formally educated outside the English schooling system. But really, It was more of a "Siiiiiir! We're bored of rounders, let's do something fun!" sort of event. I've no idea where he picked the game up, but we never asked. He was a bit young to have travelled overmuch, but I suppose he could've done a summer camp or something and seen it then. No confirmed idea though.

To be honest, I have no actual idea if he was Northern-born, or if he was just taught English by someone with a ridiculously pronounced Northern accent - we never really discussed his point of origin.

It's a bit of an iffy question here (or at least it was in my experience back in the late 2000s, feel free to weigh in, other English folk) since we've had long periods of immigration and someone who might look Asian or African or Polynesian or whatever other Cosmetic Stereotyped Association could've been born in Birmingham for all you know - an experience I've definitely defended locally-born friends from before a good eight or nine times? (That "Go back home!" line people always shout always makes me laugh at the inanity, because for all the yelling-person knows that's exactly what the person they're yelling at is doing - assumptions make an ass out of U... and some guy named 'Mption', after all :D).

If memory serves (I haven't seen the man in over a decade, so I could just be vaguely remembering him after a long sunny Summer holiday), he was also what I think is called 'Ambiguously Tanned' (?), so even supposing that on-sight judgement was accurate, it wouldn't really have worked for us inexperienced youngsters either.

** I'm in Australia, and our secondary system aligns fairly closely with the UK system. We have 6 years (years 7-12), and our academic year starts in late January and goes through until late December. Most children start year 7 the year they turn 13, although some children start in the year they turn 12 if their birthday falls in the first half of the year. Most students are 18 by the time they finish year 12. Our school holidays vary from state to state, but most states have 4 ten week terms with 2 week holidays between each term except for the end of the year, which is a 6 week holiday. I think Tasmania is the exception, with a 3 term academic year.

The house system is a thing here too, although most schools only apply it to the annual swimming, cross country and athletics carnivals. We also tend to have a student representative council that is made up of elected representatives from each year group. In the year 12 group, there tends to be 2 school captains and a number of prefects. They have regular meetings and act as an intermediary between the student body and the school executive.

We actually have one of the most segregated school systems in the world thanks to our pre-Federation history as seperate colonies and the rampant discrimination against Irish Catholics (many of whom were transported as convicts). In the state I live in public (government) schools make up 70% of all schools, Catholic schools make up 20% and Independent schools make up the remaining 10%.

A lot of people will refer to both Catholic and Independent schools as private schools, but most Catholic schools are low-fee and have more in common with the public system in terms of ethos and resources with the obvious exception of religious education. In saying that, scripture classes are a thing in many public schools on an opt-out basis. A lot of the high-end Independent schools that have been around for a long time are even more aligned with the UK system in terms of uniform standards, the house system and use of prefects. My husband went to and taught at such a school, and he said one of the major roles that prefects played at his school was uniform monitoring. Prefects were able to give house demerits and detentions to students who were not wearing their uniforms correctly, and generally had more of a disciplinary role. I was a prefect at my public school, and my role was purely representative.

It's interesting, because the way that schooling is represented in the Harry Potter books actually has more in common with the Australian system than what I understand of the UK system.

Gradually from the beginning of Harold Wilson's government in 1964, with most grammar schools being closed under Callagan and Thatcher. There's an interesting bit of political history where most Labour members support comprehensive school, but Wilson (who himself escaped a background of poverty through a grammar school scholarship) ended up as one of the strongest supporters of the tripartite system in constant conflict with his own cabinet and party over it. As a consequence, despite Labour policy under Wilson being to move to comprehensive, because of Wilson's own opposition nothing really happened until Callagan took over, and most grammar schools were closed in the late 70s and early 80s. Northern Ireland lagged behind and still had tripartite education until the early 2000s.

**** I thought it was half of grammar schools closed by late 1980s, but the technical schools were closed earlier leaving a situation with grammar schools and comprehensive schools. I applied to a grammar school in ths 2010s for sixth form so there's still a few (literally) kicking about.

The school I applied to still uses the 11+ for it's entire intake, although the 6th form is done by achievements outside of school and GCSE grades.

I decided to pull out.

I also did a varient of the 11+ for my own secondary school although they had a complex mix of intake brackets. Exam, dance or music selection, looked after children, SEN statements (incidently, me as I just missed the score) and a portion who lived within a mile of the school or something like that. It was a semi-selective comprehensive and not a grammar like the 6th form.

Not disagreeing just defining "most".
