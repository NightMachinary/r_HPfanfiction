** - Cedric died

- I wasn't fast enough

- If I was better I could have done something

- I need to protect my friends

- I need more power.

Boom, slippery slope.

*** This ^ just give him the Anakin skywalker treatment, someone important to him dies or is going to die and he wants to find a way to stop it, he ends up embracing darker magic to do so and his "i must save my friends" becomes "I must take over the wizarding world to save my friends because i need more power" and then it just loops. If you treat Dark Magic like the Dark Side in Star Wars its pretty easy to corrupt someone with it.

** Using the unforgiveables? See canon. Just torture and try to kill his friends to bring him down to a death eater level. If you actually get rid of enough of them you can make him snap.

** I think Hermione's annoying enough that he might easily snap and kill her then have to fight off the authorities.

*** I don't know how, but some fanfiction authors elevate all her bad qualities to make her so unbelievably annoying, I honestly wish that would happen
