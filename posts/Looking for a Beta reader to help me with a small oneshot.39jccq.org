I've been writing a small oneshot for an idea that i've had for the past few months and i'm coming onto the final 1/3rd and so i'd like to have someone review what i've already written, point out the kinks in it and ways to fix it. Possibly suggest other scenes to add, etc..

I've tried to use the FF.net beta system, but the thing is so confusing >.<

i'd apreciate any help.

thanks! ^{^}


** go to [[http://darklordpotter.net][DLP]] and use the WbA

**** Work by Author. You post your fic there and DLP members will give you constructive criticism on it. Note that they will focus on the negatives rather than the positives because the point of the WbA is to make the author's stories better, so if you can't handle and accept criticism you shouldn't post it there. On the other hand if you can handle criticism and are willing to edit your story in light of its flaws then it is the best place for HP Fanfiction critique on the internet.

To access the WbA forum you must create an account on DLP.

**** It would be super handy if you could put it in a googdoc; any edits and suggestions I'd like to make would be significantly easier to indicate, and there's the added bonus of being able to use a slightly less asynchronous form of chat :)
