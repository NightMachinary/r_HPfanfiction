Unfortunately I only remember that Seamus took Harry's most prized possessions; including his invisibility cloak and the photo album of his parents and burned them in some kind of ritual in their dormitory.

Edit: 1. In this story Harry wasn't sent to Azkaban. 2. I think Snape played a big role.

*Solved!* by dozyhorse: it's Inter Vivos by Lomonaaeren.


** Pretty sure it's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/520136/chapters/919256][Inter Vivos by Lomonaaeren]]

ETA I'm not sure how to do the bot? I'm going to try: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/520136/chapters/919256]])

*** It's possible. I am pretty sure, Seamus also burned Harry's broomstick (whichever one he had at that point of time).

** Something to help narrow down your researches, Harry was then sent to Azkaban. It was his punition, for... Something. I don't remember. Between Half-Year 2 and Year 5-End.

  (Title-changed) AU. GoF. Harry was sent to Azkaban for mass-murder. Now, after defeating Voldemort he returns to Hogwarts and all those who abandoned him. Sorrow can be your downfall or your greatest strength. And banshees are just the beginning.
