Looking for fanfictions where Harry gets sent to Azkaban for some reason and gets taken underneath the death Eaters wings because he's a child and should have be in Azkaban.

Not really looking for any romantic preferences just harry being taken in by the death eaters .

  Being in the middle of a dangerous war meant having to plan ahead for the worst case scenario, as both James and Lily Potter very well knew. And as such, they placed powerful safeguards to ensure their son Harry would grow up with proper guardians should anything happen to them. ...in their defence, neither of them would have ever expected what would happen to one Sirius Black after their deaths.

** For a very VERY lose interpretation, All the Dementors of Azkaban. Luna is sentenced to a year in Azkaban & Harry camps in the Cell next to hers. Very crack, but a good read. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5371934/1/]]
