** Linkffn(the blood of your veins by Arinus)

This is my fanfiction following a Slytherin (daughter of Snape and Bellatrix) through all 7 years at Hogwarts

A lot of the plot deals with legilimency and Bella trying to use it to connect psychically to her daughter to try and influence/control her but there are many other subplots.

Edit: fixing a bot typo

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5496653/1/][*/The Blood of Your Veins: Calista Snape Volume II/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/221911/Arinus][/Arinus/]]

#+begin_quote
  COMPLETE. Sequel to "Always in Your Shadow". Severus Snape's daughter Calista attends Hogwarts. As if Occlumency lessons, peer rivalry, and growing up Snape weren't challenging enough, she still has to contend with her dangerous, sadistic mother, Bellatrix Lestrange, trying to invade her mind. AU, in-character; CC where possible. In-depth exploration of the art of Occlumency.
