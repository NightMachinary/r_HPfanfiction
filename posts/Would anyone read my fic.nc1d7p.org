Hi! I have a TON of HP fanfic ideas. But one I've been really toying with is a far future generation of students who find their way back to HBP year. All time turner centric type of stuff, it'll be a lot of unintentional crack with very dark undertones and overtones.

I'm not quite sure if there will be pairings, but I am kind of toying with the idea of it being a Fred story, or it going back to GOF instead so it could be a Cedric story.

I have thought of it originally being a Draco story since I used to read his books a lot, but I've grown since then and I just seem to love more characters now lol.

I'm a bit weary about putting this out there since I don't want my idea to get taken, but the internet is what it is. I'll leave a snippet to the intro down below!


** The year was 2030. The war had ended years ago. Many still spoke of how Harry Potter and his children attended school at Hogwarts. Many still praised the trio for their efforts in the battle and harmony amongst the houses was rather a surprise to her generation.

Margot Lenwell was a halfblood. There were still a number of purebloods  in school and most of the time they were looked down upon. Inbreeding and all. You could say that things were getting better with blood prejudice, not just that but also the whole revolution and fight for equality all over the world. From blood status, sexuality, race and such.

"All I'm saying is that Hermione Granger could top my horny ass any day," her friend, Vianne, said as she slumped into one of the Slytherin benches.

"You'd let McGonagall top you, Vee." Margot huffed with a roll of her eyes.

"...fair point. There are hardly any decent girls at this school. I just can't wait to transfer to Japan where you and I can live life just as we planned!" She squealed and hugged Margot.

The two girls had made a pact when they were young. After graduating school, they would transfer to Japan for college and Vianne could become a renowned seamstress while Margot would be her model that doubles as an author.

"Only nine more months... it's a wonder how we have gotten this far."

Margot looked down at her clothes. It was just this past two years where the dress code was a bit more lenient. Vianne loved a good blouse and tapered pants to go with her altered robes. Margot couldn't careless. She opted for the skirts since it was classy, but she couldn't stand the robes. So Vianne had altered it into a blazer or a shortened cape. It was a good thing that McGonagall allowed it because Vianne's underground fashion business would have gone tits up. Vianne was right, the two girls still wondered how they would get this far in life with however many brain cells they shared. The only reason for her allowance was that after many years of seeing the same robes, she thought it need of a redesign so long as it was within code. Along with Dumbledore being delighted to see wonderful patterns and accents.

"We have the Ravenclaws to thank for that," Margot hummed and they looked at the table of blue across from them.

Both of the girls let out a sigh with a smile, "It's such shame that we were sorted into Slytherin. Had I been sorted into Blue's Clues I would be excelling. Im creative and all. Plus, their common room is by far the nicest. We live underneath a grimy lake."

"To be honest, the lake is nice. It's clean and they have those new fish that light up and stuff. Plus, we are the only room with a communal pool. You're only saying that because you upset the selkies."

It was true. Just last year they cleared out some of the storage spaces to build an indoor pool that filtered and heated water from the black lake. It was all thanks to a fundraiser they had for the school and winning the house cup that McGonagall thought it was due time to reward Slytherin house with something they wanted after all the years of prejudice and bad rep. What she didn't know, was that some of the elder students and their head of house would would change the style of the room every six months to Edwardian, Italian, sometimes colonial, and occasionally Victorian. Because they had endless possibilities to expand, they had the largest common room with the latest technology from their muggle housemates.

"True... Come on, Mc-GDawg wants us to meet in her office." Vianne pulled her friend up and they trudged to the Headmistress' office.

The password this year was: Whizbangs, a rather popular item back in its day from the infamous Weasley family. Still famous, just new and improved now. This was surprisingly their first time ever being in the office, both of them had managed to only get reprimanded in their classrooms or in halls. Walking up the steps of the office was filled with anticipation, when they came to they were obviously amazed by the structure and pictures.

"Ah! Miss Lenwell and Miss Kohrt! Glad you could make it," McGonagall walked over with her usual grace and gave them both warm smiles for them to sit down in front of her desk.

They both did so and eyed each other with curiosity, "I heard you two are planning on moving to Japan after graduation. Is this correct?"

Both of the girls nodded and Vianne spoke first, "Yes ma'am. We have the area and money set aside already! But we can't help but wonder why you've called us in here..."

The headmistress just smiled, "As Headmistress, it is always in my best interests for my students. I have a college in Japan who knows a thing or two about fashion. I find that this would be very beneficial fo you, Miss Kohrt. And Miss Lenwell, if you would wait just a few moments while I introduce Miss Khort, I will also get back to you on what I have for you."

"Wait, meet? Like now?" She gestured and looked at the headmistress with wide eyes.

"Why yes! He is a very busy man and I was able to find a moment of his time for you two to meet, now come child."

Everything happened so fast, soon enough Margot was alone.

"Well..." She muttered and looked around. There were a number of portraits. She only recognized a small few as she walked up to them. Albus Dumbledore had that famous twinkle, Professor Dippet had this kind smile but there was one of a man with a blank, monotonous, and rather depressing glare. She stared at him, knowing he was the short time headmaster during the war. Severus Snape. Surly the portrait didn't do him justice, he must have been handsome. In that nonconventional sense. She bit her bottom lip and eyes trained on him. He was seated in a dark room with his desk and wand, unlike other headmasters, his portrait was exceptionally plain.

The portraits hardly spoke to visitors, but she might as well give it a try.

"I always expected you to have scarier eyes," Her voice was just above a whisper.

What she didn't expect, was his response. "How disrespectful..."

"OH SHIT!" She cursed and stumbled back into a table.

"Now now, Severus. Spare the poor girl." Dumbledore chided softly.

She looked between the two and her cheeks felt even hotter, "Headmaster Dumbledore! I apologize for my language! A-And you Headmaster Snape!"

"You needn't worry, Margot. Now..." He shifted in his chair, "Is that a new robe designed by Miss Kohrt?"

She nodded and flourished her collarless cape blazer with her adorned Slytherin crest.

"Yes sir, it's lined with occamy sheddings."

(This is all I have written for now since it is just an idea :) )
