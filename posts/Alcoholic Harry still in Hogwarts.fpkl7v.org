Any stories in which Harry's an alcoholic but during Hogwarts and not after canon? Can be a oneshot or a long story, but I'm itching to read something like that. Preferably with a realistic "alcohol consumption" where he actually is drunk and can't just throw back an entire bottle of Firewhiskey. No slash though please. Thanks


** If you want Alcoholic/Drunk!Harry just watch the Half Blood Prince.

** Technically this one sort of fits what you want - he's an alcoholic in the future and when he bodyswaps back into his fourth year body, he remains an alcoholic. I vaguely recall lots of drunken-ness here.
