** 1. There is no guarantee that all wands have a "brother", or that you can easily track those down or that they always react in the same fashion. I think that is a very rare occurence to the point that only experienced wandmakers have ever even heard of it.

2. Even then it wouldn't work because Sirius died by falling through the veil, he wasn't killed by Bellatrix' wand.

3. And if he wanted to go through all that trouble, wouldn't it have been easier to just use the ressurection stone??

Even then I'm pretty sure that the resurrection stone merely creates a magical simulacrum of the person in question based on your memories/impression of them.

****** That could just as easily explained by "someone saved Tonks fast enough". I've seen the way you've described it done before, but the ability for that to be believed comes down to how Bellatrix is written. Does she want to purify the house, or preserve it?

Tonks goes down and Sirius takes on Bellatrix. It just seems odd that the woman infamous for massive brutality would regularly fling around stunners and only then play with her victims. If you want a better explanation, Bellatrix took the "do not kill" order literally, which limited her spell selection to prevent accidentally killing Harry with a stray spell.

** In order to use the Reverse Spell Effect, Harry would need two wands with the exact same core - IIRC Bellatrix's wand core was Dragon heartstring, so it would have required a wand whose core was a heartstring taken from the exact same dragon heart. There is no guarantee that such a wand exists.

Even assuming it did, there's no guarantee that Harry could ever acquire it, nor convince someone else to use it against him while he simultaneously used Bellatrix's wand against them(or vice versa), which is what is required for the effect to trigger.

**** /facepalm/ Missed the flair. My bad. Guess that's what I get for trying to juggle four different windows at the same time.

Pretty interesting idea though. Though how would Harry know if such a wand was out there is the main obstacle, but I suppose there are ways. And I mean, if the greatest wandmaker in the world owes you a favor(which he does, kinda - the trio did rescue him from the Death Eaters), I imagine that'd help.

***** There are a number of ways you could organically incorporate it into the plot. For example, a discussion could be prompted at the end of the fourth book about wand brothers, and wondering about finding pairs to Death Eaters' wands; Harry could be desperate to talk to Sirius again, find himself in Diagon Alley, and a discussion with Ollivander could lead into it; or, Neville could find himself with the twin of Bellatrix's wand after his other one breaks.

** Sirius wasn't killed by Bellatrix he was killed by falling through the vail so even if you somehow found the brother wand you wouldn't get to talk to Sirius.

This seems way elaborate considering that Harry knows the general location of the resurrection stone.

*** He doesn't know where it is until some way into book 7. Sirius died at the end of book 5.

That's a good point about the method of killing. I'd say that it was very definitely murder, whether or not the wand counted it as such. It would be interesting to see... besides, to serve as the basis for a story, it wouldn't have to /work/, simply it would have to get Harry's hopes up. You might thicken the story by having other individuals coming out her wand, maybe even something to do with Neville's parents?
