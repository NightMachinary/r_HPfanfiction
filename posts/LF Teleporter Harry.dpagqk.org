Partly for a Scene where Harry teleports in Hogwarts, particularly in front of Hermione, just to wind her up.

Though partly because I was watching "Jumper" and seeing Harry with a different kind of Teleportation (One that actually agrees with him) would be interesting. Harry getting so fed up with the Wizarding methods of travel causing him to land on his ass or feel sick that he's like "Fuck it I'll invent my own Teleporting" and does exactly that, and proceeds to abuse it.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

  Tom Riddle was fully expecting to stay in hell forever. But the brat-who-lived and friend has, of course, come along with an offer too tempting to refuse. Albus Dumbledore was fully expecting Harry Potter's name down for the next year at Hogwarts. He just wasn't expecting two Dark-Lords to be enrolling as well. Time-travel -sort of- and FemHarry DISCONTINUED

** Found in the Ashes linkffn(13060715)

Low-key, mainly just to display Harry's power. Harry's eldest daughter (I think she was 9) decided she wanted to go to Hogwarts early. So she stole Lucius's wand and took Teddy's place (she's a metamorph). Once they figured out what happened a very pissed Harry burst into the great Hall during dinner and middle names his daughter. After a short dressing down, Harry collects and with a wink at Hermione, disappeared out of the Great Hall.

  What happens when Harry Potter at age 29 is transported back in time with his family by a meddling phoenix? Well, when four of his kids are metamorphmagus, his better half is Andromeda Black and his sister-in-law, Narcissa Malfoy is on their side; the Wizarding World will not know what hit them. Begins in Prisoner of Azkaban, the start of book 3.

  The war between Jumpers-superhumans with the ability to teleport themselves anywhere in the world and Paladins-an ancient society of assassins sworn to destroy them has been raging for the better part of 2000 years, now with the violence at a fever pitch, the bloodshed threatens to spill into the everyday world.
