I'm curious more than anything. I know in canon Hermione occasionally chastises the boys for their language, and it pops up incredibly frequently in fanfiction as well. Like in every story. Always. Often when swearing is perfectly justified.

Is this a cultural thing? I admit to not knowing a huge amount about British culture. Or is it just an annoying Hermione quirk? Personally if a friend told me to watch my language I'd tell them to fuck off, but I'm a filthy lower class American peasant so maybe I'm missing something. I get that at times its important to speak intelligently if not eloquently, because your language and word choice reflects on you. But they're teenage kids. I've never met a teenager who didn't swear. This is incredibly petty I know. But it grates on me.

I've also noticed it's always the female character who nags the male character about their language, which I'm sure if I cared about that sort of thing I could make a case for some sort of sexism. But I don't so moving on.

Your thoughts? Cultural quirk? Hermione quirk run rampant due to authors liberal spreading of canon jam over the fanfiction bread? Me just being obsessive over a frankly minor thing? Come. Discuss, please.


** I think it was probably a plot device to explain why they weren't swearing more. I'm pretty sure I saw/read an interview with JK where she said she imagines Ron swore a lot but had to remove it from the text because of the target audience for the books.

** I was raised around swearing, but I still chastise people for swearing. It's a joke for me, as an Australian, seeing as 90% of this country swears. xD

**** Is that a meme? I don't think I've ever heard an Australian use that. I mean, it'd probably a few 'f-bombs' and 'c-words' added, especially at the end. Also, you missed the most vital word. Mate.

It's not Australian if mate isn't in there somewhere.

***** Ahh. True. I've heard it from a few Aussie friends I've talked to. Much like the ones:

"You've got a face like a smaked bum, mate."

"I hope your ears turn into arseholes and spew shite down your shoulders."

"Make a sentence out of get and fucked, mate."

"It's just a bit of banter. Go have a sook."

"I bet you don't even drive a ute ya poof. You look like the south end of a northbound camel. I'm just kidding mate, you're pretty fair dinkum. Hang on just need to pop on down to the servo to pick up some durries... Alright I'm back now. "

And many others. I haven't laughed as much on mumble as I did then. It was a riot. Maybe it's because I was drunk. I remember a lot about Winnie Blues and WaHu balls.

#+end_quote

I think that's most of it, combined with the 'they're just children!' wangkst (angst-wank?) wherein the obviously more intelligent and mature Hermione is right to correct/police/bitch at people for profanity.

Which I can only reply with even more profanity, because an eloquent motherfucker like myself sure as shit ain't gonna let some uptight little whippersnapper tell me how to live my life, much less tell me what words I can speak. Cunt.

** Its a thing that comes up when you step over this miraculous threshold to the upper-middle class. Swearing was/is seen an plebeian and parents drill their children to censor themselves as well as their peers. At least this is how it is here (Austria).

However, eventually all people start swearing. Some just know when not to.

*** Excellent application of plebian as an aside.

I suppose that makes sense, something of a combination of culturual expectation and economic status. I can understand swearing only at appropriate times, the idea of training children to admonish their peers is strange to me. Though I guess it's no different than any other form of peer pressure whem looked at through that lens.

** Hermione was from an upper middle class family in which both her parents were dentists. She was more academically motivated than any of her peers in early life, probably wasn't allowed to eat too many sweets, deeply respected authority and had a distinct drive to be better than anyone else at studies.

All of this combined is a surefire recipe for social ineptness. Which means that while she might have had have friends, but she would always prefer an authority figure's opinion over a friend's.

So when her parents would have told her that swearing is bad, she would have taken that as the right thing to do, despite any of her friends saying that swearing is a normal and okay thing to do.

Over time, that conscious decision to dislike swearing would have become ingrained into her, and she would have developed a subconscious dislike for swearing, hence her repeated use of "Language (insert name here)!"

As for your point about only the female characters swearing, I can't say anything about others, but this is just my own opinion/theory/viewpoint.

The Wizarding World is often compared with the 19th and early 20th centuries in terms of their customs and beliefs. In those time, it was common for women to dislike swearing, since the Victorian concepts of propriety were often very deeply ingrained into their psyches. That might be the reason why many authors choose to show that their female characters dislike swearing, and chide others when they do swear.

** From my experience, everyone I knew over the age of 9 swore when no adults were around so it isn't a cultural thing as far as I know but I think it is meant as an attempt to show Hermione as more mature or something like that.

** As has been said already, such a trait wouldn't seem too out of place in the book canon timeline. I mean, I learned my first swear words between nursery school and Reception (1995), but North London is an entirely different beast.

Tl;dr - either is acceptable. :)

EDIT: But it can and has been overdone.

** It's probably just the way she was raised. I was always told not to swear and no one in my home does it, so when people swear I chastise them cause it sounds a lot ruder to me than to them.

Part of what I like about writing some of the more rough-around-the-edges characters who were steeped in the wizarding world is the chance to come up with creative and new swear words, oaths and such.
