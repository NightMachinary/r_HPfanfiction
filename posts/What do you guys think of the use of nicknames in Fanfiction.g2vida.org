I've seen a lot of complaints about the use of "Mione" instead of Hermione and wanted to know what do you all think about the use of this nickname and other non-canon nicknames in general (for other characters)

Being brazilian and having read the translated version first when I was 9, the nickname Mione doesn't bother me as much because it is widely used in this version and it is the one I grew up with. However I know it is not that way in the original and people tend to have issues with it.


** I don't like 'Mione but I can deal with it. The one I really hate is Mia. The first time I saw it I had no idea who Harry was talking to.

I also despise Siri and Remy. I almost always stop reading when I encounter those.

  Salazar Slytherin has had enough of Dumbledore and Voldemort's stupidity, so on October 31, 1981 he decides to put a stop to the wizarding war. Things do not go according to plan. He loses his memories, but 10 years later he regains them when he gets a familiar letter. Bashing of some characters at first, but it gets better. A twist to the Harry is Salazar genre.

** I don't like either of those nicknames to be honest, but I have to admit that in that age it was all about nicknames for me. I don't know if it is a peculiarity of Czech language (it may be, e.g., we almost never call a small child by its proper name, but always use diminutives) or my environment, but I remember that I used a lot of nicknames as a teenager amongst our friends.

Characters calling each other nicknames are a great opportunity for show-not-telling their relationship. Frex, in canon Ronald is nicknamed Ron by most people, Won-won by Lavender, and Ronniekins by the twins. So we can see that Ron has an informal relationship with most people, a saccharine romance with Lavender, and a teasing/condescending brotherhood with the twins.

There was one that had Albie Bumblebee, which was irrationally funny to me for some reason. Gred and Forge, while canon, is fucking unoriginal at this point. They'd keep switching it up - "Grod and Feorg" "Grerge and Frod" "Grf and Eorge"

***** Nicknames/pet names aren't really... at least in English... about shortening names. Take, for instance, Ronniekins which is longer than Ron and Ronald. More realistically, you might get Freddie for a Fred and even if it's for Frederick, most English speakers will say that with two syllables so Freddie isn't really shorter.

But then you get things like Baz for Bazza for Barry or Gaz for Gazza for Gary (which might well be Gary)...

****** That's a cool perspective! In Brazil, nicknames are mainly to shorten the name and people with already short names usually get triggered cause it's really hard to give them one and they get stuck with their original name or with a syllable of it (which isn't nearly as cool)

But there are examples where you can get a longer or same length nickname(i.e. Eduarda -> Dudinha), is just not really that common.

******* I was reading your comment to Digimon below this and it sounds like this is at least partially a cultural thing, which is really interesting. It's a very different approach in England - for an example, my full name is about eight syllables, three words, and twenty-ish characters long, but I've had a three-letter nickname of my initials with virtually everyone I've ever met since I was eight years old and I've never cared once.

And I had one friend whose nickname iterated about a dozen or so times over the two decades I've known her - her surname was Fletcher, so we started off simple at things like 'Fletch', but at one years later point we were calling her Legolas (after her ears started to point slightly and also she was more Platinum Blonde than Poppa Malfoy). So things like Gin would be pretty accurate to my experience growing up here.

But this is a culture where "Hey Cunts!" can be a perfectly friendly, affectionate greeting for people you care about, so we're not exactly the most understandable bunch when it comes to nicknaming habits or conventions. :D

******** It is really interesting to think about this difference. For me, nicknames were always about shortening names, showing affection and trying to differentiate between two people of the same name. From what you told me, it seems pretty similar, so now I don't understand why people hate Mione so much.

For example, growing up in Brazil people never called me Pietra, they called me Pê(shortening my name because kids found it difficult to pronounce and we thought it was cute); my teachers called me frog(hence my username - Sapo in BR Portuguese) because in my first day of sixth grade I ate a chocolate frog during history and it kinda stuck; and in my classroom we had two people called Luísa(louisa), so one was Totti(her surname) and the other was just Lu. However is not really commonplace to have nicknames that are bigger than the actual name, not unheard of, just not common.

The "hey cunts" thing is really cool, because we do the same in Brazil, so I get it haha! I've done my high school in Portugal and though the language is the same with some differences(I couldn't get past the first page of the translated eu portuguese version of HP, don't know why) the nicknaming there is not common and usually only happens with between very close people and it is not generalised to everyone like in Brazil, people I don't really know call me by my nickname and that is super fine while in Portugal it's frowned upon. And during my time in Spain I realized that they are more similar to Brazil in that way than their neighbour.

So, in summary(this answer is too long already haha), nicknames in HP never bothered me much, they were literally EVERYWHERE in the translation. I only started paying attention to them - or rather the lack of them - when I reread it in English and then saw that people hated the use of them in fanfiction. I don't find them particularly pretty, just don't mind them. :)

(about the Gin thing: It's a personal taste of mine I guess, cause I don't like extremely shortened names. I have a friend called Lilia, we call her Lily, but some just call her Li and I just find it strange) (Rly enjoying this discussion ;D)

Isn't it just? I love culture stuff like this, the tiniest things can be so different and spiral out to be so interesting. Everything is culture, after all, and Humanity makes up a lot of stuff. :D

#+begin_quote
  why people hate Mione so much
#+end_quote

If memory serves, it's mostly association with really, really bad stories and the fact that it was only used once in canon when Ron had his mouth full. Other than that, the only reasons I've seen are variants on "It's cringy" and "I don't like nicknames/nicknames like that" and the occasional mispronunciation-lead "It sounds like 'mine' and that's creepy" because English is a bastard tongue of contradictions where ghoti and fish can be pronounced the same and accents and dialects are a nightmare to understand for anyone who didn't grow up around them. Most of the time in threads on this, people don't actually seem to explain their dislike - they just say they do.

Given most people on this site are American, I'd be interested to know if it was cultural to them as well. I don't know the American perception of nicknames.

Also, this is the Harry Potter fandom. People here are divided on /everything/. No matter the opinion or how silly you think it is, someone somewhere will be willing to die on a hill for it. :D

#+begin_quote

Really? Heh. I've never heard another country using insults as affection quite like Britain before - that's really cool to know.

#+begin_quote
  people I don't really know call me by my nickname
#+end_quote

Ah, that's a point where we'd differ, culturally. Generally, we'd refer to one another only how we're introduced or given permission to. If you were to introduce yourself with "Hi, my name is Sapo!" then most English people would exclusively refer to you as Sapo until you were close enough to play with nicknames. But if you were introduced to us at Pietra, then we'd call you that until you told us to do otherwise. I tend to get introduced by my nickname at all times (including in board meetings, which is always hilarious!), so that's why I'm almost always referred to by it.

#+begin_quote
  Spain I realised that they are more similar to Brazil in that way than their neighbour
#+end_quote

Isn't this due to the whole Tordesillas thing? Portugal not wanting to lose all of South America to Spain, but not wanting to give up India either, so they both played politics with each other and the Pope and it sort of ended up a weird smorgasboard of the two nations splattered across South America that they sometimes ignored and sometimes paid attention to, so culture sort of transmitted and integrated oddly. That was my understanding, anyway.

This is probably my favourite thing about being in the HP Fandom. Hearing about how interestingly varied the 'localisation' was in all the different translations. They're really, really different books in some places. I don't know of any other series, even those with widespread translations, that does localisation quite like Harry Potter does. :D

#+end_quote

It certainly has some influence. The thing is, the Tordesillas accord declared that Portugal would have what is today Brazil, and Spain would have the rest of South America. So, Brazil is surrounded by Hispanic countries being the only one that speaks Portuguese. So I think we have a great influence from those sorrounding countries and with the massive miscegenation that happened in the 16th century with everyone wanting a piece of american land, the Portuguese influence kinda faded, with the exception of the language.

That's interesting. Would you say that there are far fewer nicknames in Brazil, then? Like 'Pietra' will always become 'Pê' and not 'Ettie' or 'Pet' or 'Ra-ra' (that last one was a stretch :D), so they can assume that's your nickname and call you it even if they've not met you before?

#+begin_quote

That's all really interesting, from a worldbuilding/culture-nerd perspective. Cultural evolution and devolution and blending and cross-cultural ba-donka-donking and all. Sounds like it'd be a really interesting thing to posit to the 'askanthropology'/'asksociology' subreddits. :)
