E.g. Harry/ Hermione without bashing, multiple lordships etc etc. I miss reading HHr fics because of tropes.

Please no slash. Thanks folks!


** linkffn(Core Threads): begins with Superabusive!Dursleys and has the most OP Harry... no, the most OP /main character/ in the history of English literature, but is actually very funny and entertaining and light-hearted, as opposed to getting shippy and angsty.

  A young boy in a dark cupboard is in great pain. An unusual power will allow him to heal himself, help others, and grow strong in a world of magic. Eventual God-like Harry, Unsure of eventual pairings. Alternate Universe, possible universe/dimension traveling in the future.

**** He creates his own dimension /ex nihilo/, manages to create himself thousands upon thousands of blank, "spare" souls so that he can never be killed (and uses them to create some new magic because magic works thanks to wizards' collective concurrent belief, and so if he gets all of his fake souls to believe one thing the spell becomes functional). His wandless magic is so absurdly powerful that by Second Year, the Professors have no idea what to do with him since they have nothing useful to teach him (he goes back to Hogwarts only because he likes the place and all his friends are there). Etc. Etc. Etc.

**** By second year he's about immortal, not omniscient because he doesn't try (and even then he nearly is by error), not omnipotent only because he frequently does more (like, really, really, much more) than he intended, and is basically more or less on the level with most anthropomorphic forces of nature than anything else.\\
If you read Sanderson, think Harmony at the end of Hero of Ages. That's nearly Harry level on Core threads, but not totally.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

The characters are more sensible in this fic and truly think things through. They even act their age and react to situations in the way that makes sense. No one is really bashed either.

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*

** Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches by leadvone

Take a bunch of tropes toss them together, and somehow someway he makes a great story. It's worth all the love it gets on here. Well worth a read.

*** Is it really worth the read? I got to the first Express ride and couldn't do it anymore. The whole Light vs Gray vs Dark battle was annoying to me (like people getting actually mad at the Lovegoods for 'going Gray') was bad enough, but the kids separating on the train because of it and the same us vs them mentality in 11 year old was just too much for me. It felt like a slog to get through and it was all so stupid too.

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.
