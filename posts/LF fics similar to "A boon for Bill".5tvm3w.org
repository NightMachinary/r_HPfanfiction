As the title says. I'm rather fond of this fic. I know it's not for everyone, but I like the humour, the smutty parts, the way it makes fun at the Lord Potter trope and bashing fics (I mean, honestly, Molly's antics are too hilarious to be taken seriously) and the friendship between Harry, Hermione, Bill and Fleur. Unfortunately, I believe it's abandoned ):

I appreciate any recs you can give me. linkffn(A boon for Bill)

  Extreme measures are taken to distract Molly long enough for Bill to both neutralize a love potion and ask Harry to help make his engagement to Fleur possible. A kinder, smuttier alternative to Book Six's "An Excess of Phlegm" chapter. H/Hr, Bill/Fleur.
