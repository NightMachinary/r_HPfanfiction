:END:
I'll try to tell all I recall about the fanfiction even though it's been quite a while since I've read it. I'm not sure if it's been deleted since I'm pretty positive I would've favorited it or something so I'd appreciate just knowing the author if anything. Basically it's about Harry who's found a pendant that's housing the goddess Athena. He views her as his mother and has very strong magic powers such as telekinesis. I think in the story he can just use accidental magic a ton and gets taught by Athena? I'm not very sure about that anyway he gets housed into Slytherin and meets a veela in Hogwarts. He's friends with this one girl and guy and I think the guy is the son of the minister or a high-ranking position of the like? Tons of stuff happens he's very good at hand to hand fighting as well as combining it with his patented telekinesis. He eventually starts dating the veela girl who for some reason goes to the magic school in Japan I think because she was attacked by the troll in first year which Harry ended up protecting her from which is published by the Prophet. Not sure much else to be honest. The Author I know that English was his second language and I think he learned like special magic from Athena such as peoples thoughts fueling magic and the gods? Harry also dueled Dumbledore a lot in the story. Mostly the reason I'm trying to find it is a spontaneous urge to reread it since I found their little relationship quite cute. Additionally the way he went into the schools of the other cultures was pretty cool. I think I didn't really like what happened latest in their story and that's why I ended up unfavoriting it? All in all pretty cute story quite enjoyable I think it may have been discontinued? Well anyway if you're reading this far in hopefully you have a semblance of an idea the title and I greatly appreciate it if you did know. Thanks in advance I suppose and have a nice day if you're reading this!


** Damn I read this. But I have no idea what the name of this was. I stopped reading it eventually but it was a series I think. And weren't werewolves a bigger part of it? Like they wanted the artifact too or so?

*** Thanks for trying anyway at least, it's not the most popular fic so makes sense it wouldn't be to noteworthy. And it definitely was series since the guy got all the way through to fifth year at least without notable time skips. Not really to sure about the wolves to be honest but probably Harry in that fic was kind of a bad ass so he probably picked a fight with them at some point. Thanks again for trying.

*** Gorgon would make a ton of sense because from what I remember Athena carried a lot of guilt surrounding the events of Medusa in the story at least. I was pretty sure the pendant or amulet or whatever itself was snake like and Harry had like a connection to it through him speaking parseltongue. Anyway thanks for helping maybe one day I'll find it. I'm pretty positive though maybe the guy took it down sadly.
