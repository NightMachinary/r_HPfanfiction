I'm looking for a new NSFW fanfic to read. I am a huge fan of Hermione/Snape, Hermione/Malfoy (both or either ;)), and anything with Bellatrix. I feel like I have exhausted adultfanfiction.net, I want something fresh and well written. Please post fics even if they don't fit into the above character pairings--I did say I was looking for something new. Thanks!


** *Harry/Pansy*

I'm a huge sucker for Harry/Pansy, which is annoying because there's not much out there that keeps to canon characterisations, avoids fluff and avoids "love to hate" clich√©s. I think it works for a few reasons: they're not friends, so there's no risk of fluff; we know that Pansy has physical imperfections so she feels more real; but at the same time she still has a certain sexiness to her, with the whole "rich trust fund chick" thing -- a bit of a bad girl.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10100723/1/Parkinson-s-Knickers-Or-Lack-Thereof][Parkinson's Knickers (Or Lack Thereof)]]

Harry always knew the monthly budget meetings were boring, but he didn't realize just how boring until Pansy Parkinson offered to show him something a little more interesting.

This is the perfect Harry/Pansy for me.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9673766/1/The-More-Your-Ignore-Me-The-Closer-I-Get][The More Your Ignore Me (The Closer I Get)]]

It's been a month since Harry broke up with Pansy Parkinson, and he can't get her out of his head. Literally.

This one has a slight fluffy part to it, but not in a sickly sweet way.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8785245/1/Sunday-Morning][Sunday Morning]]

Harry loves these lazy Sunday mornings. Written for the fifth round of kink bingo, with the featured kink: somnophilia/sleepy sex. PWP. Adult content inside.

Pretty much pure sex.

By a different author:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5238217/1/A-Taste-of-Ice][A Taste of Ice]] Harry takes an unintended detour at Hogwarts while Horcrux-hunting. Rated M for adult content and language. Bit on the dark side. The original version can be found at my LJ.

Rather dodgy because Harry's polyjuiced as Draco, and not as well written, but hey it has Pansy in.

*Harry/Hermione*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5479108/1/Dirty-Laundry][Dirty Laundry]]

Alone and suffering in the forest on Christmas, Harry and Hermione steal a moment just for themselves.

One of innumerable "DH tent smut" fics, but this is among the best in that it isn't written by a die-hard Harmonian.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5709167/1/Adventures-in-the-Prefects-Bath][Adventures in the Prefects' Bath]]

Set during Book 4, this story departs from canon after Harry hears the clue in the egg, when he experiences an unexpected and eye-opening encounter with his best female friend. One thing leads to another, with a much more pleasant conclusion to the year.

Shippy and has an absolutely absurd ending, but the opening scene is good.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3379006/1/Hot][Hot]]

Something that I wrote during the hot summer and now that winter is here I thought we could use a warm up! Harry and Hermione having fun in the summer.

Characters are a bit OOC but it's the least shippy of the "Harry spends summer with Hermione" genre of smut.

*Harry/Luna*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6649950/1/Christmas-Magic][Christmas Magic]]

Harry is having fun with Ginny, but finds himself incredibly jealous of Luna's boyfriend... and Luna has been invited for a Weasley Christmas... H/G - H/L - A bit of fluffy, saucy, smutty fun.

There's a less smutty prequel but it's not necessary to read it. Entertaining take on teen hormonal behaviour, some Harry/Ginny mixed in and hints at Harry/Hermione.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6571368/1/A-Christmas-Break-to-Remember][A Christmas Break to Remember]]

Harry and Luna stay at Hogwarts over the winter holiday, sparks fly. A fluffy, smutty, lemony one-shot. Rated M.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6497866/1/The-Nargles-In-the-Air][The Nargles in the Air]]

Luna had a growth spurt. Harry notices. Sixth Year AU, HarryLuna, Lemon warning, no longer a one shot. Enjoy.

This one's a bit absurd.

*Harry/Other*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5445767/1/Whatever-Happened-to-Bromance][Whatever Happened to Bromance?]]

Cormac McLaggen explains a few simple truths to Harry, with profound consequences. Harry/Romilda. Smut.

Famous in these parts. No introduction needed.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2127558/1/Narcotic-Effects][Narcotic Effects]]

After the final battle Harry can find solace in nothing and believes himself to be a failure because of the loss of his friends. A certain manipulative, platinum haired woman decides to yank him out of the downward spiral that is his life. HarryNarcissa.

This one is a classic. I haven't read it in years so I don't know how well it's aged, but at the time it came out it set the standard for smut.

*Harry/Multi*

Not harem fics, before you roll your eyes XD

[[http://restrictedsection.org/story.php?story=1458][The Best of a Bad Situation]]

Harry's had a bad week, and now he's been locked in a room with four giggling girls and a bottle of vodka. What's a boy to do?

The best example of "truth or dare smut". Harry, Hermione, Ginny, Lavender and Parvati trapped in a room, drunk, playing truth or dare. Ignore the bit where Harry is basically sexually assaulted and the fic is a very good example of slow build-up and teasing the reader.

I think you need a RestrictedSection.org account to read.

[[http://www.patronuscharm.net/s/66/1/][Testing Defences]]

Hermione decides to test the wards on Privet Drive by spending a night with Harry. And then it's Luna's turn. Then Katie's, and Fleur's, and Lisa's...

This is the smut version of the fluff fic you'll find on FF.Net. Somewhat absurd but competently written.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5446275/1/It-Could-Only-Happen-to-Harry][It Could Only Happen To Harry]]

After defeating Voldemort in his final year, Harry requires a rare ritual to save his life. Luckily, he has friends who are willing to help him. H/Hr, H/Parv, H/Luna, H/Tonks, H/Fleur. Canon personalities. WARNING: comic smut. Not for younger audiences.

Probably the best smut fic in the fandom.

*Inferior smut*

A couple of fics that have some good elements but can also get very annoying with whiny characters or long periods of non-smut filler.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5790760/1/Searching-For-The-Power][Searching for the Power]]

Hermione is told Love might be the Power-He-Knows-Not and vows to help Harry find it at any cost. Be Warned of some R/Hr until chpt 20 but skipping those chapters means missing out on H/Hr/G goodness. This is rated MATURE for ADULT CONTENT. Harry/Many

This one has some good build-up and lots of nudity teasing, which is good. On the other hand, it also has whiny emo Harry who has to be persuaded to have sex, arbitrary character decisions which are transparent attempts to maintain UST, and once the fic hits harem at chapter 19 it's time to abandon ship. Also lots of non-smut filler and bashing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4541731/1/Alternative-Medicine][Alternative Medicine]]

Harry is struck down by a nasty curse that requires some non-traditional medical care in South India. Hermione, Padma, and Parvati volunteer to assist in his care, and a menage-a-foursome is born. Harry/multi.

Again, good build-up and nudity teasing. The real problem here is an absurd quantity of non-smut filler. Plus it was abandoned before the UST was fully resolved, so it leaves you hanging.

** I was going to recommend Werewolf Warriors two stories: "A Big Happy Weasley Family" (Harry/Every Weasley Woman) and "Dragon Lily" (Harry/Narcissa, Harry/Lily, Harry/Fleur) which were both some of my favourite smutty stories. Unfortunately, while looking for a link for you I've found that both stories have been taken down from hpfanficarchive. Does anyone know what happened to them? Or maybe if they are posted on any other sites?

** Hermoine/Snape, long fics:

- *[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/311126][Second Life]] by Lariope*: this is my favorite hgss fic and impressively sticks to canon, at least as much as is reasonable ;)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9646277/1/The-Love-You-Take][The Love You Take]] by Subversa
- [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=18801][The Enchanted Tower Room]] by Beaweasley2 (although I admit to skipping the Marauders/Lily-era chapters)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/676157/1/The-Fire-and-the-Rose][The Fire And The Rose]] by Abby & Domina: a well-done bodyswap fic
- [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=2485][A Terrible Temptation]] by Friendlyquark: another bodyswap (Snape-as-Harry falls for Hermione; only one NSFW chapter at the end)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2290003/1/Pet-Project][Pet Project]] by Caeria (only one NSFW chapter at the end, alas)

Hermoine/Snape, shorter fics:

- [[http://sycophanthex.com/ashwinder/viewstory.php?sid=11749][A Knock At The Door]] by Severusgirlx: short and hot. /(Note that this is/ not /the "surprise! Snape has a kid" story of the same title by Pearle.)/
- [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=10253][Crossing The Line]] by ladyofthemasque: a sweet "night before the Final Battle" fic
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8963043/1/Affectionately-High][Affectionately High]] by Dragoon811: amusing and sweet
- [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=1671][Last Minute Crisis]] by Quillusion: one of the (more-)plausible Virgin!Snape fics, with plenty of funny lines that don't cross into parody :)
- [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=10073][Twenty-four Little Hours]] by Severusgirlx: locked in a cell together

And a couple Hermione/Snape fics that I read too long ago to remember clearly, but I'm pretty sure I liked them at the time. Memory's a bitch sometimes. ;)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3814832/1/Care-of-Magical-Creatures][Care of Magical Creatures]] by Mia Madwyn: a Marriage Law fic

****** I used to be obsessed with a good Draco/Harry, but honestly nothing sticks out at me except for leather pants Draco. Apparently there are a lot of fics were they are both aurors now?

****** I've read an interesting Drarry fic called [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1143163/chapters/2313704][Dawning Affliction]]. It starts off with very DarkandCruel!Draco but thankfully he changes as the story goes on. Just a warning, there is MPREG (if it's not your thing) and Dub & Non-con (as well as consent) but the level of detail in many of the explicit scenes are unparalleled. The explicit scenes alone are like 4k+ words in length each!
