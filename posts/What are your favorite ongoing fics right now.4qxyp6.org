  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  Sirius is dead, and Harry has reached his breaking point. A chance meeting with a pale girl and her family moves Harry's life in a new direction. Rated M for macabre themes, and later on suggestive adult content.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** I also agree with /Grow Young With Me/ and /Shadow of Angmar/. Along with those are what are easily my two favorite 'full' AUs in [[/u/ihateseatbelt]]'s linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome) and linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin). In the world of 'point(s) of departure' AU is linkffn(What You Leave Behind) by [[/u/Lane_Anasazi]]. For crossovers, it is easily linkffn(Cursebreaking Hamunaptra).

EDIT: Almost forgot the previously mentioned /Exile/, a brilliant character study of Draco post war.

** I really enjoy [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11098283/1/The-Black-Prince][The Black Prince]]. The later chapters haven't been as good because of a lack of the character that I think gives the story a significant amount of its draw, the author said she's coming back in a couple chapters, so I'm excited.

** Seconding /Grow Young With Me/, /The Black Prince/, /The Shadow of Angmar/ and /Lovers and Liars/.

Other good ones: linkffn(3954448; 9238861; 8379655; 11462379; 9932798; 11196963; 5646950; 9783012; 11226787; 6996054; 11815544; 6432055)

linkao3(15257596)

Excellent WiP, for a given value of WiP. It updates once a year or so. linkffn(The Changeling by Annerb)

I was surprised by how much I liked /Questions and Answers/. It was one of the first fics I read, before I had an account, so I'd no means of keeping track of it until I caught up with it a few days back. I love how the fic focuses on characters from both the next generation and Harry's time; there's a whole bunch of characters with distinct and excellent character arcs.

/Muggle Fairy Tales are Mad/ is a really fun story. Ron trying to psychoanalyse the characters and morals of old muggle fairy tales is surely one of the greatest things ever written.

Give /Traitorous Hearts/ some time. It starts off with Draco and Astoria sounding like ridiculous caricatures rather than real people, but as the story goes on and characters are fleshed out more, it becomes a very enjoyable account of life at Hogwarts under the Carrows, though the eyes of a Slytherin.

The others are more of less well known and don't really need more descriptions.

What if his hero-complex was still intact, but so twistedly dark, that he goes through desperate means to hide it?

** A nice reimagining of the political climate in ASOIAF. With some minor errors, minimal magic, and the focus of political intrigue linkffn(Hadrian Lannister Lion of the Rock) is one of the few well thoughtout ASOIAF crossovers I've read.

Another crossover is linkffn(The Lesser Kindness by Zeitgeist84). A Witcher crossover that doesn't require much lore on the crossover subject. It tells the tale of the Harry Potter characters being born/reimagined through the lens of the Witcher world.

This next one updates between main and companion stories: linkffn(The Unsuspecting side of the Force;The Havoc side of the Force). The main story, Havoc, is told through the first person: a mercenary-type Potter. While Unsuspecting deals with the point of view of the people around Potter. Chaos ensues wherever Potter goes. Murphy's Law is always in effect in this story if I remember correctly. Spordaic updates though; Havoc was updated last april and Unsuspecting, last may.

  It goes without saying that a Witcher's life is one of thankless peril. Mutations, vagrancy, a profession of murder, and all they get for it are insults and a few pieces of gold to tide them over to the next contract. Yes, life is bad enough for one witcher, but two, in one small village? In that case, peril doesn't quite do it justice.

** linkffn(for love of magic)

Updates pretty regularly at the moment. Really like the characterization of Harry and how it affects the tone of the story. Funny without being a crackfic, deals with serious situations and struggles for Harry without delving into angst. Results of a capable, powerful, and human Harry.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

  Book 7 of 7, sequel to "Albus Potter and the Chaos Contagion." Definitely WILL be finished before the end of summer 2016! (Read all previous installments first!) The fate of the world hangs in the balance as Albus discovers there is a very fine line between power and madness, a very blurry line between right and wrong, and no line at all between our world and the Abyssal Vortex.

#+begin_quote
  AU Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley have broken up after 2 years, by mutual consent. On a spur-of-the-moment holiday Hermione wishes upon the moon to make things better. The moon fulfils her wish, as she meets someone new, but things change in a way she never imagined possible. Time travel, post-Hogwarts, ignores the epilogue. Not part of the Professor Muggle series.

  AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, covering CoS - GoF. OotP - DH will continue in a separate installment. Future Snape/Harriet.

  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6255499/chapters/14333560][The White Pawn]] is a HP/DM time travel fic by the same author who wrote One Hundred and Sixty Nine - one of the best "fix-it" time travel fics. So far it is really good but it hasn't gotten into the meat of the story yet. linkao3(6255499)

  When eighteen-year-old Draco Malfoy finds himself back at Hogwarts on the eve of Voldemort's infamous return, he is confronted with the most difficult decision he's ever had to make: Relive the 6th year at school he's tried so hard to forget, or do the unthinkable and ally himself with Potter's lot...
