#+begin_quote
  In the presence of lighthouses, the children whose eyes brim with hope and daring, she momentarily forgets that XXXX stands for dangerous and that there are people you must leave to drown to keep the light on. How frightening it is, to have something worth losing. [mermaid!OC, AU, Remus-adopts-Harry, wizard!Dudley]

** When promoting, try to link the story here (as one user already did for you). Also, try to add the summary as well.

*** I actually did so when I first posted, but because the first commenter was kind enough to link, I took it down and decided to just leave the promo summary. Thank you for the reminder anyway!

** Enjoyed it! I think there should be more references back to mermaid society, maybe the past returning to haunt the protagonist or a disease to contribute to her flaws and character development, but otherwise it's a well-written, unique start to hopefully a long series.
