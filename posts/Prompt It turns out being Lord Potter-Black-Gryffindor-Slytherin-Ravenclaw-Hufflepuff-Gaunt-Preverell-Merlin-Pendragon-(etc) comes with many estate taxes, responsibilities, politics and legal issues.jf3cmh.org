So Indy!Smart!Powerful!Lord!Hadrian thought it was the best thing ever when he finally claimed his inheritance and become the heir of all the Ancient and Most Noble Houses, but it turns out there are a lot of responsibiltieis involved with being the head of so many (apparently) noble houses (since it turns out the Wizarding World is actually a very traditional aristocracy apparently)

First of all is the inheritance and estate tax, many of the Castles and Manors he now owns are centuries behind on their property taxes and the Goblins are threatening to seize them if he doesn't pay up. To do this he must launch full audits of his assets and determine how much he is required to pay. As this is Indy!Harry... er I mean Indy!Lord Hadrian, he is unwilling to enlist any help in this endeavour, lest they steal what is rightfully his.

While Lord Hadrian was of course hoping to gain power over Hogwarts by being the Heir of the Founders, it turns out that while being Lord Gryffindor-Slytherin-Ravenclaw-Hufflepuff does indeed make him power of Hogwarts, this power also comes with many responsibilities. Firstly he must attend periodic meetings with the Staff of the School to approve lessons and budgets. He must also have individual meetings with the Headmaster and the Heads of the (school) Houses, in which he must continually renew his permission for them to act in his name (otherwise they cannot get anything done). He must also have regular meetings with the Board of Governors, while he gets Four Votes he can still be easily outvoted by the rest of the Governors, who must vote in favour of him to approve any changes he wants to make to the School. Also because he got Dumbledore kicked out because he thought he was planning to marry him off to the Weasleys and steal his inheritance, the remaining staff and students are making this all as difficult for him as possible, largely out of spite.

The various business, properties and estates he now owns. If its found he is unable to properly management these businesses then the investors main begin jumping ship so he must have regular meetings with them to convince them that he knows what he is doing.

Being the head of so many houses also gives him multiple seats on the Wizengamot, however he is too young to sit on it and also can't sit on more than one seat personally anyway, so must select regents and representatives which he can trust. He already has alienated the Weasleys due to accusing them of being Death Eaters using Love Potion on him so they aren't willing to help him with any of this. Hermione was also for some reason really offended at the offer to join his Harem so she also won't help. Fudge is also convinced Lord Hadrian is trying to steal his job so is making thinks as difficult as possible. The only 'ally' he does have is Luna, who mostly just hangs around him sometimes while telling him he just has a case of the GaryStuitis and not to worry because at least it means he's immune to the gum disease being spread by the Rotfang Conspiracy.

It also turns out that there are laws limiting how many houses a single person can be the head of, so he must find grant his kin some minor houses to lead. Due to his limited family contacts he must resort to giving the Dursleys some Houses, meaning he must have regular meetings with them as they're now his sworn vassals. Due to being Muggles their claim is tenuous and so any lacklustre performance of their part and they may lose control of these Houses.

Being Lord Pendragon sounds great on paper but it also means that the House of Windsor now consider him a sworn rival due to possessing his own claim to the thrones, so the Royal Representatives to the Wizarding Britain are doing everything they can to undermine Hadrian so that he does not try to claim the Throne from Windsor.

He's also the head of at least one Foreign House (maybe Grindelwald) which causes some issues of conflict of interest due to him now being part of a foreign nobility. That rest of the foreign nobility also doesn't take kindly to a Brit being among their ranks so are also not really that helpful, so a massive legal headache involving having to get dual citizenship.

But at least he has access to the secret spells. potions and grimoires of these houses.... expect not really. Any new spells and potions he discovers in his inheritance can't be used legally until he first registers them with the ministry, after this they must then go through a months to years long process of being subjected to committees and safety tests before being permitted and legalised. Many other spells and potions are also already restricted or heavily regulated, especially anything involving the Dark Arts.

Maintaining all this properties is a chore, especially since Hermione has convinced Dobby to convince the rest of the House Elves to Unionise, so Harry, as representative of so many Houses, must now meet with the House Elf Unions to discuss terms and conditions.

All in all, being Lord Hadrian Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Ravenclaw-Hufflepuff-Gaunt-Preverell-Merlin-Pendragon-(etc) turns out to be much more work any anticipated.


** Usually in such Indy! Hadrian stories Daphne Greengrass and by extension Tracy Davis, Susan bones, Fleur Delacour and her sister, Nymphadora Tonks is also in his harem. So he gets them to help him out. Greengrass and Bones are Sacred 28 noble family, And Tonks is an Autor plus Susan has a badass aunt.

Not to mention such Indy!Hadrian is also very powerful or Godlike. So he can just tell everyone to go fuck themselves.

** I just want Harry being forced to off himself due to a blood feud between two of the families that he's claimed for himself or else the magic of Britain self destructs or something. Harry would have to be a self aggrandizing asshole for this to work, but it would be fantastic.

** Well it's a good thing having that much money lets him bribe his way out of taxes or offshore it all. All that power lets him pay for the highest quality mentors and teachers for polisci shit, and he can have his sycophants sit the seat for him. Not entirely sure how him being a Pendragon would help him claim a muggle seat that only has traditional shit instead of actual power. Outside of him having more money than all of wizarding Europe combined, he's also usually God given mortal form in these, so he'll just do whatever he wants anyways. Who is gonna tell him no? Especially when you've given him every prominent house in the government and history.

Some of these "go against the popular trope" posts are good, but you guys take this shit way too seriously. They were fun the first 20, now that you're all posting them like three times a day, you just gotta ask why you're doing this outside of upvotes.

**** I do prefer the stories where Harry finds out he has these positions/assets and uses the power to destroy the system, rather than the â€˜lol you're silly, why would you want to have power and wealth in a system that was made by the powerful and wealthy to hoard their money and their power?'

however I agree that most Indy!Harry fics are an excuse to make him rich, not liable to be thrown in jail for massacres or using dark magic, or an excuse for harems
