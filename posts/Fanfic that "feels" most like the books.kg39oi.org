Any fanfics anybody really liked that has a very similar writing style to the books??? Where all the characters act the same and its within the same universe?

I don't really like when fanfic makes the character too moody and/or happy, completely unlike the original. Or like they'll have Harry cussing all the time, which he never really did in the books. Anything that sort of sticks to the originals as much as possible would be awesome!


** linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle) - not the same characters but this fic “tasted” the most like the books for me if that makes any sense.

  The war against Voldemort never reached America, but all is not well there. When 11-year-old Alexandra Quick learns she is a witch, she is plunged into a world of prejudices, intrigue, and danger. Who wants Alexandra dead, and why?

*** I will stan Alexandra Quick relentlessly on this sub, but for me it was quite different from the books.

AQ features some of the best friendships in fanfiction, but it isn't a fic about friendship the way canon is. The morality is also extremely different - AQ is extremely gray and has several sympathetic characters who you could call terrorists, whereas HP is pretty explicitly black and white. The AQ series features strong language, underage sex, and graphic violence (all in a very literary mold), nothing especially severe in terms of fanfic at large but much more than in canon. The high-class British world of canon vs the Americana of AQ is also really different.

** Vekin87's Albus Potter series really captured the feel of the original series to me (and a lot of other recommenders). It's a little shaky at first but it gets way better as the series goes on.

OP might also like Victoria Potter, although this is a sort of approach to making canon a bit more complex (not realistic, per se, but expanding the story and the Wizarding World). Victoria is quite different than Harry, and Hermione isn't sympathetically written so far, but it's one of the best fics updating right now so I'd recommend checking it out.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.
