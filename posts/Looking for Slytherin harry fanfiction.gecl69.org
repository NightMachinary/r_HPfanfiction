Looking for stories longer than 10k, can be finished or in progress, not interested in harry/female, im not too picky but id like there to be good character description, it doesnt matter if its first year focused or not.

No harem, or in denial harry.

Imo by far the best Slytherin Harry fanfic out there, and one of the best, period. A few more filler thrown in, and it could be an official, alternate series, at this point.

#+begin_quote
  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.
