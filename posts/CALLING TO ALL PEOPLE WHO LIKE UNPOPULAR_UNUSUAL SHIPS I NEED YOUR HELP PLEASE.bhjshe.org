Look, this is a pretty unpopular ship here but I like it okay, so no judgement.

Does anyone know any good Sirius x Lily ships? Not too much angst please (but I don't mind if it has a little), preferably something light and fluffy. So yeah, please?


** So, so not my beautiful Harry x Narcissa?

awww :(

**** Just a pun on the shipname, nothing personal. James/Lily -> Jily, Remus/Lily -> Remily, Severus/Lily -> Snily, Sirius/Lily -> Sily. Yes, the naming is rather inconsistent.

***** That's actually amazing. Idk why most people call Sirius x Lily sirily.

Sily is so much more fun...plus puns were probably Sirius' specialty.

** I remember reading one (or maybe more but I don't remember well enough) where Lily and Sirius were alive but James either was dead or abandoned her for some selfish stupid reason (it was either AU or dimension travel). They loved each other but didn't admit it or thought too much of the past (if James was dead it was because of guilt I think).

Unfortunately, can't remember the fic's name.

*** Can you remember like a phrase from it? Because I read a fic once where James died and then the plot follows something like what you described. They get together in the end tho, so that was nice

**** No unfortunately not. Maybe it was in the one where was brought in another dimension by Dumbledore through the Mirror of Erised. I think it was the unfinished/rebooted [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12918499/1/Through-The-Looking-Glass][Through the Looking Glass by James Spookie]]

But again I'm pretty sure that I saw some similar pairing for similar reasons.
