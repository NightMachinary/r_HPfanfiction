I read a story some time back that was really good. Can't remember who wrote it or the title, but I do remember some of the story. It was a trilogy about Harvey having a demon in his mind at a young age. There are three knights of God who kill these demons. Three swords, but one of the knights died. Towards the end of the first book, the sword chooses Harry as his master and he doesn't want it. All I remember in the story is that Harry fights demon lords, saves a girl(reluctantly), finds out that the girl's father is a knight, and girl is attached to him. That's all I can remember kinda clearly. Not much but would really help if someone knows what I'm talking about and sends me a link. Thanks!
