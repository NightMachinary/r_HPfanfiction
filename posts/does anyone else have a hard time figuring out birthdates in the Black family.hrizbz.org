** I personally find it preferable to sorta... wing it with stuff like this. It makes stories less similar to the rest when you put your own twists on the stuff that really doesn't matter in canon.

** [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/character/black-family/]] is probably the best analysis of the family tree I know about, and yes they got to the same conclusion:

#+begin_quote
  From the dates given, it would seem that Pollux fathered Walburga when he was a mere thirteen years old. The original hand-drawn family tree by Rowling and the painted “tapestry” on the wall of the set created from that drawing both show the dates as given here (verified in a visit to the set by SVA), so we may assume that Pollux got started a bit young.

All Black family was then already so inbred that I guess most of the members were a bit /meshugge/.

** Whoever put that "Black Family Tree" together lacks even basic math skills: Bellatrix's father, Cygnus III, also was only 13 years older than her.

Therefore, I think authors can COMPLETELY disregard it when writing their stories. They can of course use some names. But they should only pay attention to these canon facts:

- Sirius was born around 1959/1960
- Nymphodora Tonks was around 1973, and graduated from Hogwarts just before Harry arrived.
- Tonks's birth year means Andromeda Black should be born before 1955.

I would make Bellatrix the middle sister, simply because Andromeda comes before Bellatrix alphabetically. It also makes sense that her elder sister running off with a 'mudblood' radicalized her and made her more determined to uphold 'family honor'.

As a result, Andromeda was born in 1954, Bellatrix 1956, and Narcissa in 1959. Lily and Marauders would have some overlaps with all three Black sisters. I think this would make fics from that era more interesting.

** I take that family tree with a pinch of salt, especially the dates, since JKR is notoriously terrible at maths.

I usually age Walburga up 5 years and Cygnus down 5 years, to make Walburga born in 1930 (sitting her closer to Orion, born 1929, perhaps in the same year at school?) and Cygnus born in 1933. This sits the three siblings (Walburga, Alphard and Cygnus) closer in age, and means that Cygnus was around 18 when Bellatrix was born, and Walburga around 29 when Sirius was born.

This also better fits my headcanon that Walburga's family were proposing to marry her off to other notable pureblood families - her branch was 'just' a tertiary branch of the Blacks at that time, with her grandfather Cygnus the youngest child and third son of Phineas Nigellus. I hc that Walburga was the one to initiate the relationship with her cousin Orion, heir to the family, because she couldn't bear the thought of losing her name and not being a Black any more - /and/ that she had eyes on Grimmauld Place and sitting herself within the line of succession. So it makes sense, to me, that she was a bit older!

** I don't see the problem? at that age, it is already possible to make children right?

**** Yeah. Well... if I judge them with the modern-day sensibility with my own culture, I agree with you. But this is an entirely different culture, different time, maybe even different species. I just turn off my brain on something like this in fiction. If he did, that's okay. If he didn't, that's alright too. It is not like the character (minor character, even) is the self-insert of the author that shared her view, right?

JKR world is enjoyable to me, and I don't want to involve politics in my fiction reading.
