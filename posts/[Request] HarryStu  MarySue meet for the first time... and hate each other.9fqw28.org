Or anything with both a Marysue and Garystu together.


** "Ron." Hermione whispered.\\
"What?" Ron whispered back.

Hermione subtly gestured towards the middle of the Great Hall. There, Harry Potter, and an unidentified young girl with brilliant gold hair (who had for some reason foregone the school uniform in favour of some...latexy catsuit) were staring each other down, motionless.\\
The scene was reminiscent of one of those old Wild West shootouts, right down to the tumbleweed rolling between the two (courtesy of a conjuration cast by, surprisingly, Draco Malfoy).

"That." Hermione whispered again, "What's Harry doing?"\\
"You mean Prince Harry James Peverell Gryffindor Slytherin Ambrosius Evans-Potter?" Ron snickered.\\
"/Ron./" Hermione sighed.

Ron looked smug, before he looked over his shoulder at Harry and the mysterious girl, "See that girl?"\\
"How could I not?" Hermione muttered.\\
"Her name is, Princess Marilyn Alpha Omega Gryffindor Slytherin Hufflepuff Ravenclaw Cleopatra-Caesar Seraphim Sue."\\
"...Mary Sue?" Hermione repeated slowly.\\
Ron nodded, "Tragic story; muggle-born, her parents were murdered by nameless Death Eaters, she would have been too but a great big huge silver dragon swooped out of the sky and crushed the bad guys. Because it was her familiar. She went to an orphanage where she was queen and worshipped by all the other kids and adults, but she was still somehow horrifically abused by bullies despite being naturally talented at really powerful wandless magic and having a dragon for a familiar, until her Hogwarts letter came. Despite her young age she was bumped straight up to 5th year so she'd be in our year level."

Hermione raised her eyebrows. She raised them a lot, nearly touching the ceiling.\\
"You weren't kidding about Harry being Prince Harry Ambrosia...whatever he was, were you?" she asked quietly.\\
"Nnnope." Ron said smugly, "That's why they're facing off, it's Marty Stu vs Mary Sue."\\
"Why haven't they destroyed the Great Hall yet, though? Heck, why haven't they moved?" Hermione pressed.

Ron looked at the frozen Harry and Marilyn again, carefully studying the two for a few seconds.\\
"It's obvious, innit? Harry's wound up for his big signature spell, the one where he calls a stone lion out of the ground to devour his enemies alive, while Marilyn's wound up for HER big signature spell, the one where she conjures a giant sword and slices a mountain in two."\\
"They don't even have their wands drawn." Hermione pointed out.\\
Ron just shrugged, "Wandless prodigies and they each know about two dozen different traditions that don't need a wand anyway. But anyway, Harry can't cast first, because if he starts the incantation for the earth lion, Marilyn can stop time and cast her greatsword at leisure, but she can't stop time right now because if she tries to start /that/ spell, Harry can interrupt with a super-speed athame, but if he tries to do that then Marilyn's protective ward will kick in and protect her, but if she tries to rely on that then-"\\
"Yes, yes, I get it." Hermione sighed, "Let me guess, if Marilyn tries to cast her greatsword first then /Harry/ can stop time but she can superspeed but Harry has a protective ward and stuff."\\
"Got it in one." Ron answered, "Basically, whichever one commits to an attack first, loses, because the other can instantly identify and counter it to win."\\
"One of them could win by bluffing. Feinting, disguising what spell they're casting...?" Hermione offered.\\
Ron shook his head, "Hermione, they're a Marty Stu and Mary Sue. They're so overpowered, they can't even imagine lying and cheating to solve their problems."

While Ron & Hermione ate lunch, Prince Harry James Peverell Gryffindor Slytherin Ambrosius Evans-Potter and Princess Marilyn Alpha Omega Gryffindor Slytherin Hufflepuff Ravenclaw Cleopatra-Caesar Seraphim Sue were still staring each other down motionlessly. As they left the great hall, a stray sparrow that had flown in took the opportunity to start building a nest in Harry's hair.
