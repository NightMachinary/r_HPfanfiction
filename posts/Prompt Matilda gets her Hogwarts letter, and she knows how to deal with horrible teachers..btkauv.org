*** She was British in the book, but it should otherwise be based on the movie plot. The movie is better and has more "magic."

That said, it would be very interesting change to canon. Matilda arriving in the year of the Tri-Wizard Tournament (based on the date of publication of the book), new to magic, but more knowledgeable about muggle subjects (maybe even literature) than Hermione. She would definitely make some waves.

*** Probably should have mentioned crossover...

Matilda is a book by Roald Dahl about a girl who can move stuff with her mind and plays pranks, she eventually uses her power to get rid of the horrible headmistress at her primary school. There are quite a few parallels to HP.

***** Although there's a hint of Tom too, since she uses her magic/telekinesis at a young age for a complicated plot to ruin the headmistress's life. Not that she didn't deserve it. Maybe also a hint of Fred and George or the Marauders with her parrot prank...

****** I always thought canon Hermione really couldn't have handled living at the Dursleys or most of anything that happened to Harry. Matilda is a mix of Harry and Hermione, with a dash of the Weasley twins.

But to digress, Matilda is one of my favorite roald dahl books though. Roald Dahl wrote some... interesting books. I'd honestly be interested in more crossovers.
