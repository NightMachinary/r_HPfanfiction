Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Last Chance) is probably the cutest version of this trope that I've seen.

*** I enjoyed it for a while, but I got tired of the several chapter span of "it's not your fault" over and over again. The impression I got was that the story wasn't much about Harry teaching other than providing a backdrop to the salient plotpoints. If you like the more touchy-feely stuff this fic has it. Dumbledore in particular basically becomes a teddy bear of affirming notions and gentle kindness. If you were looking for a more in depth take on the trials and tribulations of /teaching/ though, perhaps look elsewhere. There was a baseline assumption that Harry is good at teaching, which is acceptable, but it then goes to Harry is just given a job as a teacher at the premier wizarding boarding school, Hogwarts.

But that doesn't mean that I think no one should read it or enjoy it. Obviously other people are going to have different tastes, and sometimes even a different mood makes something that seems sloppy or poorly done instead feel light-hearted and fun.

Basically, I don't like it. That doesn't mean I think other people are bad, stupid, or wrong if they do, and I think that's something that is often not said around here.

#+begin_quote
  Seven years after defeating Voldemort, Harry Potter has been raising his godson, Teddy Lupin with the help of Teddy's grandmother, Andromeda Tonks. What will happen when Fawkes the Phoenix pulls this happy, war-weary family back in time for a chance at a better future. Set before the breakout from Azkaban in OOTP. No paradox.*What We Lost* is the sister fic without time-travel.
