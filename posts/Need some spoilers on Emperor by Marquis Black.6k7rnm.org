***** Are you... sure about that?

It's been so long between updates that I'm fuzzy on the details, but his newest chapter /really/ made it sound like she was already dead.

**** [[/spoiler][Given the direction this story is taking, it wouldn't surprise me if Harry arranged her death and blamed his enemies for it.]]

**** [[/spoiler][She became pissed with Harry's policies and behaviors by the end of war with Germany, and was actively undermining his authority afterwards. Ellie had the support of elder Potters, Sirius, Neville, and majority of Harry's government, so he couldn't just dismiss/overrule her that easily. Instead, he secretly reactivated Albert Hughes and instructed him to create 'diversions' all over the place. I become increasingly convinced that Harry was now having a relationship with his long time head of the guard Astoria Greengrass.]]

****** A LOT of things have happened between the point you stopped and my spoiler. The most interesting part of the story BEGAN after his conversation with Ginny.

[[/spoiler][You will find out later Ginny is a true monster in this story, and yet still credible given her Canon personalities in this new reality.]]
