#+TITLE: In search of a fic where Hermione is sure Harry needs to get laid (due to stress I think) but is rather unsure what exactly that means. It is probably a time travel fic.

edit: The scene might have been a throwaway(no relevance to overall plot, just something funny).

Fairly sure it wasn't a sexual comedy.

Pretty sure it was first year, maybe second year. Hermione obviously had overheard the term from her parents or older students or on the telly before Hogwarts in relation to stress relief but hadn't yet learned it was a term relating to sex.

It may not have been a time travel fic but not sure.


** That sounds hilarious.

*** The story exists, i remember reading it/that scene. Can't remember the pairing but don't think it had one then since she's too young to know what the term meant/too young to therefore date. Pretty sure it was a comedy, maybe a crackfic.

  OOtP Mid Year. Every now and then throughout wizarding history, a pair of individuals very close to one another find that their magic has grown attached. A bond is formed. A Soul Bond. And may hell burn the idiot who ever thought having one was a 'good' thing! A Soul Bond story done 'right.' No bashing. A Harry and Hermione love and war story.
