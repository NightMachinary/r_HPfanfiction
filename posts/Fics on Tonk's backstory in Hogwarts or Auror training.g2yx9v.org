** There is quite a lot in linkffn(Innocent, MarauderLover7) I think, but it's not really canon compliant as it mainly tells the story of how Sirius saved Harry from the Dursleys before Hogwarts and their life during the Hogwarts years. But there are definitively a few chunks that focus on Tonks and her auror training with Moody and these are some of my favourite bits of the story.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

*** I really like Innocent; the caveat is that it takes half a million words just to reach the start of Hogwarts, and then you have book 2. And book 5 is in progress.

**** I know, that's a bit of a problem, luckily we don't have to wait for Tonks until Hogwarts starts. But I must admit I still haven't read all of them, every time I stop it's so hard to get back into it and I can't start from the beginning every time.

** I have a bit about her working as an Auror in my story here: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14828709/chapters/34317807]])

And here she as a sixth year at Hogwarts, although this story is mostly about the Weasley twins: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14846531/chapters/34366397]])

  Complete! Tonks knows all about werewolves, thanks to her Auror training, so now she can humansplain lycanthropy to this intriguing man she just met named Remus Lupin. That'll impress him, right?

  Fred and George Weasley are used to pulling pranks with a hairpin and pocketknife, but in their first year at Hogwarts, they find some extra help locked in a drawer in Filch's office. These characters are the property of J.K. Rowling.First Place Winner in the Honorary Marauder category in the Shrieking Shack Society's 2018 Marauder Medals. Thanks to everyone who voted!

  What? Why was Amelia snickering? Surely it was a good thing to have such a legendary auror like Alastor Moody as a mentor... right?
