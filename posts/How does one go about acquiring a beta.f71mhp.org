The title speaks for itself. I want to write a fanfiction but want someone to bounce ideas off. Said person would also have to be well versed in grammar and spelling. I also wish that they could be good at correcting dialogue and helping expand my writing.


** Well the comments here aren't very helpful at all. A lot of people find betas through their readers. But you seem to want a beta before posting anything so things are different.....

Here is what I suggest: find a fanfiction group geared towards what genre/pairing/ type of hp fanfiction you like. It could be a discord group for your pairing, it could be one of the harry potter writing groups on facebook, etc. Where you find like minded people, they will be more willing to read your work and beta, and if you join a writing group that has beta trades or beta forms, people are probably willing to help there too.

**** no problem!

also dunno how much luck you will find with this since they get a LOT of beta requests but the [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] discord has a beta trades channel. You can try there and then just branch out asking ppl if there are other specific groups.

Good luck.

** If I understand AO3 correctly, first you must find an alpha and an omega and then you can form a "pack".

**** Yeah! Although, I've never been one before; however, I'm pretty good at picking up grammar and spelling errors in fanfics I've read lol. Worst case scenario I could be you're interim beta until you find an experienced one! (Or longer if not:D)

** I'm not a native speaker, but I can certainly give you some feedback on your ideas if you'd like. I've begun to write hundreds of ideas and the reasons most of those never went anywhere taught me a lot about the feasibility of ideas, tropes and conflicts.

** Write good fanfiction until you have fans/people who like your work. Then ask them/ make your desire for one known in an authors note. People will usually volunteer if they like your work.

Alternatively, hire one with money.

** I have been active in the fanfiction community since the late 1990s, I have written my own stories and have been a beta reader a few times.

I can tell you it can make sense to have more than one beta-reader. Maybe somebody is great with plot while another is good with brit-picking while yet another is good with spelling and grammar.

I would be willing to beta-read for you, but I am not a native speaker so I am not the best candidate if you want somebody to check your grammar.

** This is one of the great mysteries of the universe. Unfortunately, it's rather difficult to find free editing of any type, and virtually impossible to find people willing to commit to reading new stuff if they aren't already familiar with your work. I've taken to publishing scenes from my work on AO3 in the hope of attracting people interested in beta reading.

I wonder if it would work to make an open beta reading sub in which people could post pre-publication works for open review.
