Vector manipulation is badass!


** And for those who don't know what that means, I'll explain Accelerator's powers and their context in the Toaru universe. Mostly because I like Toaru, but also because "vector manipulation" is kind of a vague term.

*tl;dr: Are there any fanfics where Harry has extremely powerful telekinesis? Possibly separate from and interacting oddly with magic? Alternatively, is there a fanfic where Harry has such extreme ability to perform mental calculations that he can easily outpace supercomputers, and exploits that ability?*

In Toaru, there are two main types of powers: Esper abilities, which are based in mundane science and math, allowing people to manipulate the world using applications of science and math. For instance, using math that describes how electricity flows, inputting your own values in your head, then forcing those values onto the world, creating an electrical charge. Naturally, how well you can do these calculations in your head plays a large portion into how powerful you are, though in many cases the calculations seem to be only semi-conscious. There's also magic, which uses abstract ideas and concepts to manipulate the world. For instance, utilizing the Christian "burden of sin", applying it in a very literal way to weigh down your opponents based on how far from the Christian ideal they are.

Accelerator is an esper, not a magician. As OP said, Accelerator's ability is vector manipulation. That is, if something can be described as having a vector, he can modify its vector however he wishes, so long as it's physically allowed (unless something has changed, no vector manipulation to escape a black hole, for instance). In other words, he has total movement control. If he can come into contact with something, he can change its speed and direction. He has no well-defined soft limit, he doesn't seem to accelerate anything to relativistic speeds, but he is powerful enough that the only reason the Earth continues to exist is because the one thing he needs is air, and there's not much of that in space. In fact, he once says that the only thing he'd have to be worried about if somebody fired a nuke at him was getting oxygen.

The most used application of his powers is a field which automatically reflects any incoming object away from him, including some frequencies of light. This works exactly as you'd expect. If something comes in at an angle, it flings away. If it comes straight in, the force comes right back into the object. Thus, punching Accelerator as hard as you can, at best, results in busting up your hand because it's no different from punching your own hand. He can change how this works, but this is how it works by default.

It does not turn off, even when he's asleep. It's arguable that, before he got brain damage, he'd struggle to consciously turn it off. The only way it's ever come down is by overclocking his power. Just to illustrate how fucking absurdly OP he is: There was a human clone whose mental capabilities were programmed in. However, he needed to reprogram part of the clone's brain. He did this by reading the code, then forgoing the machine that converts it to neuron patterns by manually adjusting the clone's brain /because he could do it faster/. He did this by adjusting the vectors of each and every particle involved. /That's/ what it takes to get his reflection field down.

I also feel the need to clarify: His reflection field is /not/ a shield. As I said before, it is an application of math. It cannot break, be pierced, or be (easily) bypassed. His reflection field just makes it physical law that anything that crosses the reflection field is instantly reflected back.

Of course he can do other things. Fling buildings around, reverse somebody's blood flow, even fly. In-universe, you can't even use teleportation against him, because teleportation is described as moving through higher dimensions, therefore having a vector and being reflectable.

Because esper powers and magic are inherently incompatible, Accelerator's powers react in strange ways with magic. In one case, a magically-created projectile of ice was /supposed/ to reflect back at the caster, but actually exploded on impact in a rainbow of light. Of course, Accelerator is so fucking overpowered that once he's learned a bit of how magic works, he uses his vector manipulation to "sing" a song which casts magic by vibrating the air around him in a very specific way.

Espers also can't use magic without suffering damage of all kinds, from lacerations out of nowhere to internal bleeding and organ failure. I doubt this would show up in a similar fic though.

I'm not gonna go into angel forms because that's a murky, complicated subject and probably not what OP wanted anyways.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11635055/1/A-Certain-Scientific-Accelerator-may-also-be-a-wizard][This one]] has him as Harry and getting pulled into the Tournament. Not the greatest fic, may also be dead. Never found any other accelerators crossed with this fandom though.
