George and Fred were always creating new things together. Together. After Fred's death, he can't think of any new inventions. He starts scraping together half-done ideas left behind Free's passing. The store becomes less popular. Then one day, someone notices things getting better. But all the new amazing products seem to be related to glass or mirrors and communication. George sits alone in the tinkering lab, he seems like he'll explode if he stops creating. The voice of his brother encourages him through the Mirror of The Erised.
