** It's pretty important. Harry is protected at privet drive because he shares blood with Aunt Petunia. There's also the ritual to bring back Voldemort which includes blood of my enemy.

The whole gringotts blood test is entirely fanon, but based on the lack of limits on magic, along with the clear importance of bloof, it's a feasible leap in logic that they could determine ancestry with a blood test.

*** Also, drinking unicorn /blood/ pretty much curses you.

And the person who invented the /blood/ quills (that in fanon were used for the last bajilion years for signing all the contracts) is called “Dolores Umbridge”.

I believe that's all that is about blood in the books.

******* Originally Pottermore, at least as far as I know, though it no longer is here and that bit of info can only be found in the transcript of the original thing which is here:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/2kvcx0/phoenix_is_out_on_pottermore/clp258m/]]

This is the, or at least a, transcript of the Pottermore page on Umbridge, and it does contain the footnote that the black quills she has are of her own creation which no longer is on Pottermore. Additionally, the wiki, for however much (not much but whatevs) it's worth, does list both the transcript and the Pottermore page on Umbridge as the source for the information that she is the creator of the thing, with the transcript being added after the page which could indicate “switching sources” when the original source got changed and it had to be changed to a snapshot of it (which the transcript would be).

That said, yeah, info released after the books, so there are people who ignore this on principle and I don't really blame them.

*** Don't forget when Dumbledore has to cut his hand when they enter Voldemort's cave in 6th year. Blood can also act as a very valuable sacrifice.

** Blood is certainly important in canon magic (the Blood Ward on Privet Drive, etc.), but "blood" as in "the substance coursing through your veins", not anything else. It's a marker of identity, and the "goblin ancestry test^{TM",} while fanon, could very well be canon --- it does not necessarily imply inherently magical blood, either; for all we know, the spell could be working a rough DNA test, comparing it to records of blood taken from ancestors who were also clients of Gringotts.

This all has nothing to do with the /pureblood/ ideology, which holds that having muggles anywhere close in your family tree makes you less magically powerful. In this sort of argument, "pure blood", "muggle blood" and so on do not refer to the substance itself, but are merely an archaic shorthand for "ancestry", "lineage". Much like "noble blood". Though they may have in the past (like muggles did) believed blood itself was the marker of ancestry, modern Death Eaters and sympathizers certainly do not hold the power is contained in the blood itself, it's only a metaphor.

** As far as Canon goes blood is not that detailed as important but when it is, is quite serious.

However I don't really agree with the blood itself being important, thus supporting the pureblood agenda, more that is the best possible channel. I believe I read it on 'For the Love of Magic', a quite good and deep study that goes into blood only being the most easily available magical product of a wizard's body, thus useful to test his magic and perform special rituals. Is not that the blood itself is different, but that the bleeder is magical.
