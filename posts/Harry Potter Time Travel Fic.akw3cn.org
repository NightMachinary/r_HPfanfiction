Ok, so I've been looking for one specific fanfic for a while. I believe I read it on Fanfiction.net. This is basically all of the information I can remember about the fic; It's a fic where Harry goes to the past and trains to be an Auror, along with Tonks. Moody is one of the trainers, along with OCs. On the first day, the trainees are split into groups, into colors. Harry is put into the green group, as Moody saved him a shirt because it "matches your eyes." The group goes to an obstacle course. later, there is a mock dual competition, which Harry almost wins, except then he gets in the way of his own curse, because the trainer reminded him of his mother. There's also something about Harry sleeping with his trainers roommate, or something like that?

anyway, thanks for the help!
