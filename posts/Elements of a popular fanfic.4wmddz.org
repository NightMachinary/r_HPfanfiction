Let's say I'm a massive attention whore and all I want from life are as many reviews as possible. What do I write to maximise reviews?

Some ideas to start us off:

- Write a Harry Potter crossover with a popular franchise that was the subject of a recently released (and well-received) movie.

- Annoyingly, people do seem to appreciate fics that have a certain minimal standard of technical writing competence, so I will have to still write relatively decently (though perfectionism is to be avoided - it slows down update rate).

- Write a fic which parades multiple potential romantic interests for your protagonist past the reader, teasing them with each of them, but never committing to a single pairing (except for short term relationships that are clearly not the OTP) making the readers wonder what the final pairing will be.

- Use cliffhangers frequently.

- At the end of each chapter, write an author's note that says something controversial about canon that makes readers want to argue with you.


** If you just want a high number of reviews, have a lot of chapters. There's a specific breed of reader who reviews every chapter leaving no actual feedback, just "good job", "great work", or "loved it". Take a 100+ chapter fic with 1k reviews; a single reader like this could be responsible for a tenth of those reviews.

*** Not only that, frequent updates ensures maximum time on the front page. Though for HP on fanfiction.net, front page turnover takes place every 45 minutes or so, so even that's not enough.

** If you really want reviews, why not deliberately introduce several exteremely simple too correct grammatical errors per chapter? That way, reviewers can point them out where they otherwise might not have reviewed at all.

**** Lol. I do sometimes think it would be an interesting exercise, but I don't know if I could bring myself to actually do it. I don't suppose I'd have to spend too long working out the plot at least. I'd have to post it under another ID too. But semi-seriously, don't you think readers would pick up on it if it wasn't somehow sincere in its intentions?

***** If done properly, there's no way to tell the difference between sincerity and satire. Personally, I went for a 50/50 mix of genuine and crazy, and no one's called my bluff yet, so it might be working. The real trouble isn't getting caught, it's getting too invested. Even a low effort plot takes time to type out. At some point, you'll look back and go, "Goddamn. I've spent weeks on this, and it's now my most popular fic."

** Doesn't it make sense for crossovers to come out around that time? How else would the author get the idea? Story ideas aren't formed ex nihilo.

It's tempting to believe that increased quality automatically leads to reduced quantity, but I think the true metric here is 'time spent writing.' If someone works incredibly hard, there's no reason to believe that they couldn't increase /both/ their words per day /and/ overall quality.

I agree with your third point about pairings, though. `Shipping/romances in the HP universe have almost nothing to do with the characters and everything to do with the readers' trope preferences. If an author can't decide on which of /those/ elements they want to incorporate into their story before they begin writing, then that's a big red flag.

I agree with the fourth point, too. Doubly so for catch-phrase endings that are resolved in the first one hundred words of the next chapter and never mentioned again. Ever.

I don't know about author's notes being beacons for controversy. That's never been an issue for me, but maybe we just aren't reading the same stories.

** Frequent updates are important. Also using author notes to engage the reader should help but please do not outright ask for reviews. I usually only review when the writer does something brilliant or really stupid.

So write a decent story with frequent updates. It should have a somewhat different plot but not really necessary. You can use clichés but add a twist to it so it is not all what the reader expect.

When you put in a twist like that where the reader is expecting a cliche it comes as a pleasant surprise to the reader.

Story shouldn't be choppy. It should flow well.
