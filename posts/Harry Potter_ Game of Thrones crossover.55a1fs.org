Romance with Harry involved would be nice. NO SLASH


** linkffn(The Last Lion of House Reyne)

Decent fic if you're good at reading over shitty things authors include for no reason.

*** What shitty things are you referring too? I read this fic recently, and nothing really stuck out at me other than maybe [[/spoiler][the dad dying for super convoluted reasons]] which I would have preferred to not happen.

**** Dual wielding swords, the girl-is-master-archer trope, and a few other things that add nothing but make the fic worse for their presence.

#+begin_quote
  He remembers being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a beast borne of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of cold dead things. He is the second son of the king, a spare, but his fortunes change when secrets rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming, but magic is might.

** I personally enjoyed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11132113/1/The-Difference-One-Man-Can-Make][The Difference One Man Can Make]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11959184/1/Hadrian-Lannister-Lion-of-the-Rock][Hadrian Lannister Lion of the Rock]].\\
linkffn(11132113; 11959184)\\
The other recommendations in this thread are all good as well. My personal favorite would probably be The Black Prince.\\
Edit: Whoops. Forgot to mention that Hadrian Lannister Lion of the Rock doesn't have romance YET. The author has stated that Hadrian will be remarrying but hasn't given anymore information than that.

  Reborn as the eldest son of Tywin Lannister, Hadrian must shoulder the responsibilities of being heir to Casterly Rock and play the game of thrones. As war takes hold will he rise to win the game or will he be crushed by the factions all around him. Rated M to be safe.

  The Master of Death, Harry Potter, wakes one cold spring morning in Westeros. He has no idea why he's there - or how he'll get back. Harry always had bad luck, but a lot of persistence. He'll need it. Winter is Coming.
