:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
All I remember is that the fic begins at the end of first year when Harry tries to tell Quirrel that he can't control his own actions and Quirrel discovers that Dumbledore put him under heavy compulsions and it results in Voldemort rescuing him. That's all I remember


** Replace Quirrel with Crouch and move it to 4th year and that's the plot of linkffn(The-Well-Groomed-Mind)
