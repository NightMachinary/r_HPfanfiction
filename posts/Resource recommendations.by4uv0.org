I, csmalley1992, have a confession to make; when planning/writing my fanfiction I unabashedly mine tabletop gaming books for research, insipiration, and ideas.

And I would like to share my favorite books with you. Most of these can be downloaded for free from The Trove.net.

As this is a Harry Potter fanfiction subreddit, this list will be heavily magic/world-building oriented.

GURPS Books: Published by Steve Jackson Games, GURPS (short for â€˜Generic Universal RolePlaying System') is a fairly modular series of books known for it's indepth, accurate research, extensive mechanics, and somewhat confusing mathmatics. The idea behind GURPS, at least in the beginning of it's publication history, way back in 1986, is that the books would be a supplement to other systems such as Dungeons and Dragons and Champions. I have found the books immensely helpful for planning and writing.

The books I suggest:

GURPS Magic, Fourth Edition: A good all-around book about magic and spells, including several different types of magic.

GURPS Thaumatology, Fourth Edition: This is actually a small subseries of books further expanding magics.

Urban Magics: Using magic in urban settings and building magical towns, including logistics. Has a nice section on magical education.

Sorcery: In tabletop terms, Sorcerers are magical folks with inborn magical talent, as in Harry Potter. So this book covers options and spells for characters built as Sorcerers.

Ritual Path Magic: Covers ceremonial/ritual magic.

Magical Styles: Covers mixing, matching, and even creating magic systems.

GURPS Wizards, Third Edition: Covers creating wizard/magical characters. Includings sample characters and templates.

GURPS Grimoire, Third Edition: a further supplement for Magic, hundreds of spells listed.

GURPS Locations: Worminghall: A fully made, medieval university style magical school, with options for customization/modification.

GURPS Celtic Myth, Third Edition: Roleplaying in the British Isles before the Romans and Norsemen came. Covers both realistic and hollywood history play types. Nice section on Celtic magic.

GURPS Social Engineering: Back to School, Fourth Edition: Covers schools, how to build a school, etc.

GURPS Egypt: Covers Ancient Egypt, slightly out of date but still useful.

GURPS Imperial Rome : Covers Ancient Rome, slightly out of date but still useful.

GURPS Greece: Covers Ancient Greece, slightly out of date but still useful.

GURPS Aztecs: Covers the Aztecs, slightly out of date but still useful.

GURPS Middle Ages I: Covers the Middle Ages, slightly out of date but still useful.

Ars Magica: A game line by Altas Games; the idea behind Ars Magica is that in a psuedo realistic medieval Europe there is an organization of mages called the Order of Hermes and the players play these mages.Offical canon starts at around 1220 AD. I've found these useful for worldbuilding:

Tribunals are legalistic and cultural groupings of mages: Real history and folklore beliefs are woven in with game mechanics.

Heirs to Merlin: Covers the Stonehenge Tribunal, which covers England and Wales.

The Contested Isle: Covers Ireland.

The Lion of the North: Covers Scotland

Faith and Flame: Covers France-ish, the way the game's Europe is divided into Tribunals is weird sometimes.

The Lion and the Lily: Covers the rest of modern day France.

Guardians of the Forest: Germanic lands.

Ultima Thule: Scandinavia.

The Dragon and the Bear: Russia

Lands of the Nile: Covers Egypt, Ethiopia, and Nubia. I mainly use this book for building the history of magic. Also deals with some Islamic magic.

These are the rest of the books from this line that I use:

Covenant: In game terms, a Covenant is a group of mages that live together, work together, pool resources, and vote together.

Through the Aegis: A book that details five already created Covenants. With a bit of modification, these can become the starting points of a magical school like Hogwarts or a settlement like Hogsmeade.

Art and Academe: Covers the medieval education found at a medieval university, some history about real universities and how to deal with school set stories.

Ancient Magic: Covers eight different types of magic based on ancient history, including Greco-Roman curse tablets and Norse Runic Magic.

Hedge Magic (Revised): Covers six more magic types based in real folklore, includes a small Runic dictionary.

The Mysteries (Revised): More magic types.

Ambientation-Apprentices: Covers characters from birth to adulthood.

Mage: The Ascension by White Wolf Games was often billed as Ars Magica in THE MODERN AGE, or at least the late 80s-early 90s, with an added enforced Statue of Secrecy type Masquerade. M:tA, as it is often abbreviated, is part of a bigger, shared game world called the (Old/Classic) World of Darkness. Recently, for the 20th Anniversary of the cWoD, new books have been published as Mage 20th or M20 I use the following books:

From the original cWoD: Dead Magic I: Covers ancient magic.

Dead Magic II: Secrets and Survivors: More ancient magic.

Witches and Pagans: Real folklore with a creative twist.

Initiates of the Art: For building low level characters.

Masters of the Art: How to handle very high level characters.

From the M20 line I favor M20: How Do You Do That?

Mage: The Awakening is the reboot of the original Mage game for the (New) World of Darkness/Chronicles of Darkness game world. Grimmer, more dangerous.

Magical Traditions: Covers varieties of magic.

Legacies: The Ancient: Even more ancient magic.

There are some more books I would recommend from the different WoDs; if you're looking for dark magic or blood magic, the Vampire lines are your best bet. Shadows over the UK covers the supernatural side of the UK.

If you'd like more recommendations or have recommendations of your own please comment and share!


** I feel pretty silly for having never thought to use my DnD books for inspiration. Thanks for the idea.

*** Don't worry, I only hit upon the idea when I was hitting a writing block/my muse fucked right off.

I don't even play TRPGs but I was desperate.

** Any opinion on the differences between Ars Magica 4th and 5th edition?

*** Weeeellll, I don't actually play the game, closest I ever got to playing a TRPG is probably playing Vampire: the Masquerade: Bloodlines and the Elder Scrolls series, so take it with a grain of salt or two but:

Looking at how the books are laid out, I definitely prefer the 5th; the layout is simple and makes for easy reference as they tell you where the subsections start and even list the asides and inserts.

As for the canon tweaks that occurred between 4 and 5? Honestly, I just cherry pick what I need; if I find something that has two different versions I either merge them or pick the one I like best. Mind you, I still tweak them further, the ideas I get from these books are only the base of my own twisting and creating.

I do however stay away from the third edition runs when I can; White Wolf had tried to merge Ars Magica with M:tA/cWoD and...it didn't quite work and that shows. Plus, too many demons. Seriously, it seemed like every Bad Guy had demons, literal demons, either pulling their strings or bolstering them.
