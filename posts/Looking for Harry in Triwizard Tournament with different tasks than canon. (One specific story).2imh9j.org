I'm looking for a story in which Harry's in the Triwizard Tournament, but it has different tasks than in canon. I think the first task has Harry with partners participating. I remember they are Animagus, and one of the girls on Harry's team dives from the Astronomy tower as a bird animagus. Can't remember more details than that.


** Temporal Beacon and the lie I lived are the only two really well done alternative Triwiz I can think of, but I'm positive TB does not involve Hermione, and don't think in either of those there is a bird animagus. Harry Crow is the only one that I know does for sure.

*** Temporal Beacon is awesome. And it does involve Hermione [[/s][a lot]]. They're both bird Animagi, Hermione's a small burrowing owl, while Harry is an Osprey.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8186071/1/Harry-Crow][Harry Crow]] has a scene similar to that, I'm sure.

Can you be more specific about the fic you're looking for? Is it just a Tri Wiz fic? Are there any memorable pairings, or something else that happens earlier or later that you can share so that it can be narrowed down?

***** Some people may have trouble remembering that because they don't like author X, that in no way obligates other people to also dislike author X.

***** It's not that you're not supposed to/allowed to like Robst, it's just that he's the Pewdiepie of fanfiction, appealing to the lowest common denominator. Other writers and readers who think themselves more sophisticated very much dislike his stories. I try to stick to the middle on this one: I recognize they're not great works of art, but I did enjoy most of them for the most part, and I very much appreciate the effort of actually completing them rather then abandoning them.

****** Oh ok so its like those people who only enjoy david fincher movies and hate every marvel superhero movie because its too cliche? I dunno I liked harry crow. But I also liked hocus pocus adele polkiss which is quite different from regular hp fanfics. I just don't they deserve harsh criticism for something that takes time and effort and gains them no money.

******* Well on some level, you can't discount the jealousy aspect of it either. Here is an author that over the course of just a few years wrote the same story 12 times and got tens of thousands of reviews and millions (probably tens of millions) of hits while others who write painstakingly thought out characters and plot and have been doing so since 2001 barely get a blip of recognition from the masses. Those people get more respect from the tighter inner communities which are more personal and more meaningful, but envy is a basic human emotion. It's like a filmmaker or actor looking at an Adam Sandler movie and asking "How the does this drivel make money while I'm struggling to eat?" Thus they turn to harsher and harsher criticism as the years go on. Most of us can grudgingly respect the effort taken to keep on going and finish every single story, even if the over use of cliches diminishes their value.
