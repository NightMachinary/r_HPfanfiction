Yeah, I just want to read some real wholesome family fuzzy long fics about how they actually got closer, decided to marry, and then how they had their kids, and then how they raised their kids and some of the fun times or even bad times they had over all those years...

I'm especially interested in the whole /how Harry coped with and learned to be a father over all the different stages (caring for a baby, a toddler, etc)/ aspect of those years! So if any stories focus maybe a bit more on that particular part of his growing up years... :D Please! If there isn't a long fic that covers ALL these years and events in one go, I'll settle for a couple medium fics in a series, or even shorter fics if they're great enough!


** Have you read Linkffn(The First Day by little0bird) or Linkffn(The Strangers at Drakeshaugh by Northumbrian) or anything by Northumbrian really. They have an entire anthology of post-Hogwarts canon compliant fics

**** Strangers at Drakeshaugh is reasonably long by itself, but also, it's part of a much larger unified world by Northumbrian. I'm not sure what his/her total word count is, but there are several dozen stories included.

**** You will love them, I promise. There is this scene in The First Day that makes me cry every time.

Each is longer than Half Blood Prince by a substantial margin, so you have plenty of reading to do :).

** FloreatCastellum has a lot of ficlets about Harry's life post-Hogwarts and some missing moments from the books in her [[https://floreatcastellumposts.tumblr.com/LinksToFiclets][tumblr]]. Each fanfiction is not long, but you'll still be satisfied with the amount of fanfiction she wrote. She also posted some of it on AO3, but I don't think she posted all of her ficlets.

There's also [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/13075][mischiefmanaged!verse]] by irnan on AO3. It's a short series on ~50k word, but still a good Harry's post-Hogwarts life.
