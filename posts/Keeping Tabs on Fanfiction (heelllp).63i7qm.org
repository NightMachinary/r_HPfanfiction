How do you guys manage it? Do you just use your favorites on ffnet to keep track of your reading or keep all of them open on your PC/tablet/phone in expectation of either an update or renewed interest on your part?

I ask because I'm the latter, and it's spiraling out of control. I have 21 tabs open on my phone, all of them fic, and the list is growing because I like reading the recs here as soon as I see them instead of finishing the stories I have stockpiled. I can't use favorites because the android app is made of suck. I want to use your superior organization methods to counteract my subpar ones. Thank you and good night.


** Create an account on FF.net, it helps a lot.

I keep completed stories as Favorites, and WIP as Story Alerts.

I also download some them in EPUB format and organize them in iBooks.

** Fanfiction.net has an app now, don't know how I'll manage without it (+ you can download fics on it!).

*** I second this, you can 'follow' all the fics that sound interesting and the app will download them all (as well as all your favorites) so you can read them offline.

*** I have the ffnet app, but for some reason it glitches weirdly like 65% of the time, doesn't show an accurate status on recently updated fics, etc. :^( I do have it, though, and use it to glance over at old favorites from time to time. Maybe I'll give it another chance.

**** Theres a different app you can use. It has a lot less functionality, but it is easier to use, and more reliable. You only need to sign in once, then you can download fics, access your favs and follows and do some searching. The search functions are not great, but I just have it set so whenever I open an FFN link, it uses the app instead of browser.

**** ? Strange, you maybe have an old version, they work on it now with lot's of updates to make more like the website. If not, then I'm afraid it's your phone.

** Your data rate must be hell.

On PC: Right click > bookmark all tabs > "New folder #" > repeat as necessary.

I'm up to #40. And it's getting time for #41.

** AO3 has a 'Mark for Later' button that I use all the time. If you have an account on AO3 it's right next to the 'Comments' button on the top of the fic. Also, you can create bookmarks for offsite fics if they're hosted on other sites- its just a link to the fic plus your description and tags in the bookmark.

** Pocket fanfiction on ios by bjued

I use follow stories whether they're incomplete or complete to proc them to the follows folder if i'm reading them for the first time and favorite if i've read twice and second read doesn't make me realize i was hopped up on new story endorphins.

*** +1 for pocket fiction

also you can make your own folders. a 'currently reading' folder is very useful, especially when watching more stories than you're currently interested in.

** I use follow on the ones I've read I want to read until it finishes.\\
I use favorite on a complete fic that I would be interested in reading again at some point.\\
I use google doc to keep track of recommendations given to me from either here or when I go through author's favorites when I finish their stories.\\
I also just use the web browser on my phone instead of the app.

** Wow, a lot of these methods have a bunch of steps. I don't think i'd have the patience to use half of them.

I use this app. [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spicymango.fanfictionreader]]

It's an offline reader for the ffn website, with search and community browsing. If i see a fic i like, i add it to the app library.

Stuff in the app library is checked for updates by pressing a button.

That's it. That's all it really does.

Well, that and night mode and some font settings. It's a very simple app for a very simple task. If i want to move my library around it's pretty easy to do too. It does well with my large library, i dont have a count for it, but its a 115mb text file that contains all my books.

** I favorite/follow my favorite ones. Some of the other ones I just keep in list form on a Google document as links with short decription that I add to whenever I feel like I have too many tabs open. Kind of a pain to add but it works better than other methods for me.

** Author Alerts/Story Alerts are your friends.

I remember when they just had Author Alerts...

Over the years I've probably received 15,000+ email from fanfiction.net

** I use bookmarks, and my ffnet account favorite/follows. When a fic updates it sends an email to me, and then I have any emails from ff.net or ao3 forwarded to my phone. So I know instantly when a fic I follow has updated.

** Completed fics I've saved as epubs on my kindle.

Uncompleted are on my favorites list on ffnet. For non-ffnet I have accounts with favorites where applicable

(like ao3).

For other sites that I visit rarely I have a bookmark folder with seperate site subfolders that each has individual stories that interest me.

Come to think of it, quite a bit of energy has been spent just managing this shit.

** I download every interesting looking fic using Calibre+FanFicFare, then bulk upload them to my Ebook reader. Read fics get a rating in Calibr, so I can keep track of what is in my reading queue.

** I maintain a spreadsheet with columns title/source work(s)/Completed, Ongoing, or Dead/series (if it is split across multiple fics)/URL (of first page of work)/Comments/grammar & spelling & prose rating/Read or unread.

This way I can mark my favorites, recommend to others, and keep track of various fic sites in one place. I share it at [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6x97i6cscw9xwi/Table%20of%20Fics.xlsx?dl=0]] if you're interested

** You realize you can use the mobile FFN website and it works perfectly fine too, right? You can keep track of what you're following and everything. Log in, and at the top right of every page click "more" and it'll show you links to your favs and follows.

My favorites are only for things I've finished reading and enjoyed. I follow a work if I'm really interested in the idea, or I've read the author before and like their style, that way as soon as it's finished I can check it out.

For my "shit I need to read" pile, I have two things: a dedicated folder on chrome, and the library function on the FFN app. I just have to open a story once and it goes to my 'library'. I remove a story from my library when I finish it so it stays neat.

** You guys are all crazy. I just add everything I like to favourites and sort them by last updated, at least for unfinished fics that I'm following this is largely enough. Update emails would drive me completely crazy with the amount of fics I read.

Of course, this system only works if I have access to my phone/laptop and read nearly every day. An interruption of a couple of weeks would throw it all in disarray (but it would be awesome catching up).
