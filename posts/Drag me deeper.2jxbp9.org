I have very little experience with fanfiction. I've only read a few to completion, and really only Arabella's [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2345300/chapters/5171522][/The Very Secret Diary/]] and Thanfiction's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4315906/1/Dumbledore-s-Army-and-the-Year-of-Darkness][/Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness/]] stand out as one's that I loved.

The thing that I loved about both of them is that they are so well interwoven into the canon that they can basically be thrown in alongside a series reread and feel like an addition instead of an alteration. Also that they fleshed out characters that the main series sort of brushes aside. So my first request is if anyone has any other similar fanfictions, especially ones from a perspective outside the trio.

My second request it to push me into something else. If you have a fanfiction that doesn't fit at all with what I've described but you feel it's worth reading, let me know. I love the Potterverse and want to see what else can be done with it, but the mountain of HP fanfictions is a little daunting to approach without a map.


** I recommend the collected work (77 stories!) of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]], tightly written prose that could well be considered extended canon.

** Miranda Flairgold's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life][A Second Chance at Life]] is heavily (really heavy) AU, with alot of new magic, new characters, new plots, and new everything. It is fantastic. The first and second are finished, but the end sequel sadly is not.

If you haven't read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]] by mizuni-sama, go read it now. Best fanfiction out there hands down. Competent and extremely intelligent voldemort, great character development, new magic exploration, and also heavily AU. It is not finished yet, and has slow updated (once every 2-3 months) but it is nearly finished.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5077573/1/RuneMaster][RuneMaster]] is a more casual read and it is not as well written as the last two. It starts really fast and harry becomes very powerful by the end, but it is an entertaining read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4563439/1/Ectomancer][Ectomancer]] This is one of the best fics out there. Sadly it is not completed.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9720211/1/The-Merging][The Merging]] This is very canon-esque in the sense that it writes and flows like Rowling's story did. Teenage Angsty, usual character development, nowhere near as AU as the other fics I recommended. It is a WIP and is turning really good up until now.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Wastelands of Time]] First fic I ever read, and along with Prince of the Dark Kingdom it is the best out there. It is the best written fanfiction out there. Next to none spelling and grammar mistakes, great flow, good build-up, amazing suspense, new creative magicks, and a bad-ass Harry with a bad-ass Voldemort to counter him. Sequel is out, yet it is abandoned.

Enjoy! And welcome to the fanfiction world where you will no longer have anything else to do with your life but read fanfiction.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2889350/1/Bungle-in-the-Jungle-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure][Bungle in the Jungle]] for a drastic divergence from canon, a badass Harry, and an interesting second person perspective.
