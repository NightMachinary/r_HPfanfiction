For some background, I'm a massive fan of some of the large ships, but I'm always on the lookout for stories where Harry is female and in a relationship with Ginny or Hermione, whether throughout the entire story or it's a build up to that ship, it anything inbetween.

I've read several of these before, Holly Evan's and the Spiral Path, The Power of Love, and a few others. However, the only ones that seem to be prevalent are primarily smut, and I'm not such a massive fan of fanfics that are mostly smut, I generally prefer fluff or just standard love stuff.

Other than that, I'm not too picky in what I read, other than that I prefer in progress or complete fanfics.

If you have any other minor ships that are along these lines I'd still be interested in reading them.

  Sequel to The Power of Love: Voldemort is back, the Ministry is in denial, and Dumbledore is stalling, but Jasmine isn't alone. She and Hermione are supported by new friends, defended by two shieldmaidens, and empowered by ancient magic. Eliminating Voldemort is the least of the tasks which prophecy expects from them, but how will these witches transform the whole magical world?

  Harriet Potter died at one year old. What was left of her slogged through life, alive in body and mind but not soul. Six years later she was finally cremated. This is not the story of Harriet Potter. This is the story of the brilliant flame who inherited her place, and her journey in the strange world of humans.*****Harriet is trapped, surrounded by humans, and painfully easy to extinguish if she doesn't keep her flames hidden. After the Dursleys, Hogwarts is a step up for her, but now she has to unravel the mysteries surrounding the body she stole and fight to survive against a monster who may be even less human than she is.One by one, Harriet's friends will find that they are playing with fire, and the price of failure is greater than they ever could have known.

  Molly tried her best. When Harry had told them, Arthur had asked excitedly, "is this a Muggle thing?" Hermione had hurried out a "no!" and a frantic history of gender diversity in the wizarding world. "It's just that I'm a girl," Harry had said, and Arthur had nodded and asked her about how telephone booths worked. He would call her by the right pronouns until the day he died at the respectable old age of one hundred and thirty three, and he would make it seem easy. But Molly had to try. Hermione explained things faster and higher-pitched every time Molly messed up a pronoun. Molly frowned and muttered and put extra potatoes on Harry's plate at breakfast. Harry slept in Ron's room, which didn't bother either of them but which made Hermione scowl. Harry got boxes of sweets and warm hugs, as Molly chewed things over. For her fifteenth Christmas, the Weasley sweater she would receive would be a bright, friendly, terrible pink. The next time Harry visited, Molly put her on Ginny's floor to sleep-- for some definition of sleep that involved Hermione hissing threats at three in the morning if Harry and Ginny didn't "shut up about Wronski feints, do you know what time it is."

** Here's my master list of Fem!Harry/Hermione fics. Don't read any Harry/Ginny, so don't have anything for that, sorry.

 

*/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13285012/1/][A Fair Life]]/* is one of my favorite ongoing stories. Reptilia28 Reaper challenge, Harry is told Hermione is his soulmate (as always in this type of story (I will note that this story DOES NOT have soul-bond type stuff in it...)) but this time has an answer for why he didn't get together with her. She doesn't swing that way. Reaper checks Harry's file, he is supposed to be a girl...

The story is (so far) about Fem!Harry Learning how Magic society works (and how it is different now that she is female) while going through the triwizard. Love the relationship between Harry and Hermione, doesn't just come on, there is some buildup. Very fluffy.

It has the standard Ron/Dumbledore bashing inherent in a Reptilia28 challenge fic(If your the type to dislike that sort of thing), but the relationship between Harleen and Hermione is wonderful. It just feels extremely nice to read their relationship.

 

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11602420/1/][*/Call Me Moriarty/*]] Hermione/Villainous Fem!Harry.

 

(I know that you read this one, but keeping it on the list for other people.)

*/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11197701/1/][Yule Ball Panic]]/* and it's (600,000 words of) sequels. I find the relationship between Fem!Harry and Hermione in it adorable. This one, once you get past the first story (which is entirely Fem!Harry slowly coming out to Hermione) is fairly fluffy, combined with a strong plot.
