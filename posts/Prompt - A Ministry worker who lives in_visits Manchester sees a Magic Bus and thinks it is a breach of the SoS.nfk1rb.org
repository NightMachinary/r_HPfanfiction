In Manchester, some buses are branded as Magic Bus ( [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Bus_(Stagecoach][Magic Bus (Stagecoach) - Wikipedia]]) ) with some of the past bus fleet having cartoon inspired images of a wizard.

Now I had the thought about what if a Ministry worker who lives in Manchester, or is visiting Manchester on official business, sees one of these Magic Buses (or even a Megabus named Al Bus Dumbledore/Nimbus 2000) and deems them a possible breach of SoS as they refer to magic.

Anyone want a go at trying a fic based on it?
