:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello fellow Redditors, As you can see I am looking for a Fanfic, from which I‘ve forgotten the Title and most of the story... I can remember some details about it though, so i hope you can help. I don't remember how it starts, but at some point in the past Sirius found a girlfriend from Sweden? (Up north in any case) whom is a professor at Hogwarts (history I believe) and a veela. By the time of Harry‘s second year she is Sirius‘ fiancee and fights alongside Harry the Basilisk with such reflecting Glasses they are using in „Harry and the Runestonepath“ (She nearly dies there too...)... that‘s all I remember for now, i hope someone can help me with that... Thanks in beforehand


** Linkffn(Harry Crow)

Edit: it took my brain 2 hours in the middle of the night to remember this!

  What will happen when a goblin-raised Harry arrives at Hogwarts. A Harry who has received training, already knows the prophecy and has no scar. With the backing of the goblin nation and Hogwarts herself. Complete.
