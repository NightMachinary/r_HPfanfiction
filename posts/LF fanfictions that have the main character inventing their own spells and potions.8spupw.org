Nothing too overpowered.


** I'm sorry but I have to mention this. In Intersecting Realities, Harry invents a spell that causes virtually instant death by causing the target's brain to have multiple aneurysms at once. He invented it while he was drunk, and he wanted it to be faster and more efficient but just as deadly as the Killing Curse. You perform it by doing a small twist with your wand and muttering this word... /Pew./

  Latin; a dead language with no practical applications except perhaps the deciphering of old texts and as a particularly quaint party trick. Thankfully, as Harry finds out, Latin is not as dead as he was first taught when he decided to learn the language. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, of course; he loved Latin, and would have been proud to know it even had it been as useless as it was pretty. But in the world of Wizards, the world of Magic, Harry realizes his rare talent with words is particularly valuable in the highly complicated and controversial subject of Spell Creation, a subject he soon becomes enamored with despite having to hide his interest from everyone. Besides, it's not like he's going Dark, after all.

  AU. Voldemort kills Dumbledore but is defeated by a child. In the aftermath, Snape becomes the Headmaster and radically changes Hogwarts. Harry Potter of House Slytherin begins his Third Year at Hogwarts Battle School and realizes that friend and foe are too similar for his liking.

In terms of power, Harry is at best just one or two years ahead of his age group (when he is 13, he attends 4th and 5th year classes). He is a prodigy, but he would still be beaten down by most adults (thats how magic works in the HP canon).

****** That really doesn't come up. Harry is in a different house than her, and is only at Hogwarts for half a semester. Besides which, the HP books never actually give us a direct comparison of the intellect of the majority of students, so for all we know there could be one or five students in their year who are close to her in magical skill during the books. That, however, is a moot point.

And what? How did you get /dark witch/ and overpowered Lily from that? No. She, like Snape and others, was a reasonably talented, slightly above average witch. Which is how she is in this fic. Harry /may/ one day approach Dumbledore or Voldemort, but he could never reasonably match even his parents as they are during this fic.

Thats how HP magic works, more or less. People who study and work hard to learn magic invariably end up being the best at it.

******* Oh, if she doesn't have a presence then it's a bit more bearable.

The Lily thing is because I've often seen her in fanfiction where she survives and Harry gets sorted into Slytherin as some extremely powerful witch that Voldemort is afraid of, if not as much as Dumbledore. Besides, how is Snale slightly above average? He was a prodigy.

As long as he doesn't approach Dumbledore or Voldemort when he's only 11 then that's alright.

If you like it, you should check out the DLP extra chapters (which are frankly more interesting), but you need to register/contribute to read them.

Also, I forgot to mention, but linkffn(Ectomancer) also has some spellsmithing, but mostly in the background.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
