Here's a fun drinking game, take a shot everytime you come across a fic that has Harry in character. It's a fun drinking game, because chances are you won't be chugging a single shot and will infact remain completely sober.

Seems like a lot of writers spend most of their time making Harry how they want him to be. So do you like him? And I know at least one person is gonna call Harry bland and as someone who is currently rereading the series, he is many things; bland ain't one of them. Wouldn't call him the most fleshed out character either, but he certainly has character.


** I legitimately love Harry, honestly. He really is my favourite character in the series, and I know that's not really a common thought.

JKR did sometimes write Harry as simply a lens to view the world by or an engine to advance the plot rather than as his own character, but by no means did that mean his character wasn't there.

Harry's a favourite of mine because he's this kid who just feels the need to do what is right, despite any hardship he has or will experience along the way, and I really love that about him: he devotes his entire life to surviving and helping others survive, and I deeply appreciate that about his character.

It's definitely not a life that's made easy for him, but it's one he goes on with, and that's part of why the fics where Harry suddenly becomes selfish and only self-concerned upset me so much - it's simply not in his NATURE to completely give up thinking about everyone else and just get out of dodge. If it were, he would have done, and I bet he wished a dozen times he could just cut himself off.

But he can't. He couldn't. He'd never.

Speccy little shit. I love him.

*** Don't forget snarky and sarcastic. One of my favorite things about Harry as a character is that in a lot of ways he is just a normal teenager who happens to have terrible luck. He's not infallible he's not perfect. And yeah I agree at the end of the day he is pretty selfless.

Example oh hey by the way there's this girl in the dungeon you have to save her from this huge monster snake yeah no problem

Evil professor and nobody thinks he's a danger totally going to go protect that stone.

He just jumps to the cause. Yes sometimes it's unrealistic, but that doesn't mean that it's not good

  I also like his selflessness. Without even knowing you, he'd lay down his life for you in a second.
#+end_quote

And you say this based on... what? pretty much every time he put his life in danger in canon it was for a personal stake, or for very close friends. I hate how authors take the phrase "saving people thing" and turn it to "Harry wouldn't let anybody die, no matter what! he'll take the cancer from a dying man so he won't die!", which is fucking bullshit. Harry has altruistic qualities, yes, but he's not Jesus. He hardly cares about his friends' problems, if you look into it. If he was one to die for others not to, he'd have given himself to Voldemort the minute he appeared at Hogwarts.

He wasn't in Hufflepuff because he's not exactly hard working, and not fair - as in, he doesn't mind cheating.

tl;dr stop flanderizing Harry.

As ridiculous, but then any extreme is. Harry was a complex character, and he was quite altruistic - moreso than you displayed. Ultimately, he did die for the Wizarding World.

And the extreme opposite you bring forward is even worse

Leaving aside his knowledge of Voldemorts fixation, this just doesn't work at all on the facts, as we see when Voldemort takes over the ministry in DH.

He didn't think to buy Ron a new wand in CoS. He barely notices how Hermione is high strung in PoA, and when he does, he barely cares. It's very rare for him to give his friends a good word. He's just not the kind a guy who cares about everyone's problems, since he has enough of his own.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Debatable. He only decided to go to Voldemort when he realized he was a Horcrux. He died to kill Voldemort, which is pretty important for the wizarding world, but it's more of a personal conflict, in my opinion. Rowling herself said that, had Harry looked into the Mirror of Erised by the time of DH, all that he would see is Voldemort finished.

During the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry lets others fight and die for him, which goes completely against what the original poster said. If he gave himself up, Voldemort would've probably left the population of Hogwarts alone, which is not something that can be said about the Ministry takeover. Again, I'm not saying Harry would not give his life to save others, but he wouldn't give his life just for anyone and any purpose, like the original poster said. He knows his value, he recognizes his purpose, and he would only lay down his life for that to succeed.

** He's one of my favorite characters. He's tough, smart, a smartass, decent, brave, relentless, and forgiving. My favorite part is that he can be all these things while still being incredibly flawed. He's got a bad temper and an out-of-control mouth. He's reckless. He procrastinates about important stuff. He can be oblivious about people/things if they're not directly in his line of sight/part of a mystery. For better or worse, sometimes, he just doesn't listen to anybody. He's a total hero while still being edgy and frustrating enough to be totally human.

I wish there was lot more IC Harry fics. So many just turn him into a cliche. It's like they're trying to spice him up, but it usually just comes out boring and predictable.

HP is a children's book that went way further than it was intended to, and as much as I love HP, it's... simplistic, especially in the characterization. Most characters are assorted stereotypes and there's little to no character development.

Of course we do. Many of us like different things, and want to tell different stories. Those stories usually need a character more proactive than canon!Harry is shown to be. Also, if an author didn't change Harry to suit the story, they would be accused of sticking too much to canon and thus being boring.

Also, our experiences shape the majority of our personality. The lessons we learn early in life shape our decisions going forward. If you change Harry's situation at an early stage in his life and he does not change because of that situation, there was no point in putting him in that situation in the first place. There would be no point in AUs, because changing the situation would do nothing to change the character.

Finally, a lot of writers are bad writers and can't do proper characterization. Thus, they don't count.

** He's okay, relative to the series standard for character development and complex characterisation. I just find that it's difficult to be OOC when you're basically a walking plot device. Harry is exactly as curious as JKR needs him to be, most of the time, and exactly as angsty as she felt like writing at the time. It's inconsistent, but then again, so is a lot of her writing.

I notice it a lot more, now that I've grown up and had time to analyse the books, but it's not that Harry is especially bland, but that all of the characters are quite bland. The base /concept/ of the character isn't always the case, but they are usually quite shallow and lacking in development, and Harry's development is... all over the place. Inconsistent, and driven by the whim of the author, who admits to not re-reading her own work.

In order to be IC, Harry basically has to be a stooge of the plot. He needs to investigate things, but not be /too/ smart about it at any given time, or be curious about anything not involved with the plot. That's Hermione's job, and when she's not holding a plot-induced idiot ball or being just plain evil for no reason, I love her for it. Seriously, we have seven books about a /magic school/ and not once does JKR give a coherent model for the magic system. This should be wizardry 101, and it's something I figure Hermione should have known back-to-front by the first week. The Watsonian explanation is that Harry is terminally uncurious about his surroundings, and he somehow either missed that class, or never cared enough to think about it at all. I kind of hate that. The Doylesian explanation, however, is that JKR never stopped to work out how her magic worked, that class /never existed/ and she never rectified her mistake throughout seven. Damned. Books. Seriously, for books about magic school, this is unforgiveable, and it reflects badly on Harry's character in my eyes.

Additionally, Harry needs to be naive enough to not question anything the author hasn't figured out an answer to (like the aforementioned 'point-stick' model of magic that just works because it does). He needs to be /good/, but also do horrible things like casting Unforgiveable curses, and suffer no repercussions for doing so (god forbid he learn something from the experience). He needs to be /special/ when the plot demands, but not so special that he actually has power to change the status quo in a meaningful way. He needs to care, but not care enough to actually want to change things with any power he does manage to acquire. This is, incidentally, why the epilogue is such a wall banger for me - despite everything, the Wizarding World post-Potter is effectively the same closed-minded, racist backwater it always was, and Harry never did much to change it. Nobody did, despite nineteen years of intervening time. It's a depressingly bland idyll that hides ugliness and apathy, which reflects poorly on every character mentioned therein. Lastly, Harry needs to be a variable amount of famous depending on whether he's meant to be a living myth or an international celebrity today. It's all a crapshoot anyhow, so just write him how you feel like, at the moment you feel it. After all, that's what JKR did.

Maybe good fanfiction has made me bitter, but canon wasn't kind to Harry. He never really grew into his shoes, and had to rely on plot armour and Deus Ex Machina a lot in later books rather than having become good enough to have a fighting chance as an underdog. Maybe I just don't like passive protagonists. Because the series uses Harry as a proxy to show /everything/, the flaws of the series and the flaws of Harry are one and the same. Hell, at its base, he has some genuinely admirable qualities, like his bravery, snark... but looking back on it, I weep for all of the things we /could/ have learned about the Wizarding World had the protagonist been Hermione.
