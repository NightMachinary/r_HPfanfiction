  Dungbombs and Stink Pellets were dropped so frequently in the corridors that it became the new fashion for students to perform Bubble- Head Charms on themselves before leaving lessons, which ensured them a supply of fresh air, even though it gave them all the peculiar appearance of wearing upside-down goldfish bowls on their heads.

*** Thanks, though I feel as if it falls into the same pitfall as the other evidence. The fresh air could just as easily have been pre-dungbomb air.

**** I don't think so.

The average human head is approximately 20 centimetres (7.8 inches) from the back of the skull to the forehead and approximately 23 centimetres (8.6 inches) from the top of the head to the chin.

The average 3 gallon fish bowl is about 11 inches wide and 10 inches high. Since presumably the bubble head is formed /around/ the head, we don't have to worry about the physical constraints of getting the head in and out of the opening. But that is a reasonable choice to base the work off of.

Because I am not going to work out the amount of space left in a 3 gallon fish bowl /after/ you put a human head in it, we're going to say that the bubble head charm has the full complement of 3 gallons (13.5 litres) of air. Air is only 20% oxygen, however. Which leaves us with 2.72 litres of oxygen in the fish bowl.

Humans consume roughly 0.5 litres of oxygen and expel 200ml of CO2 per minute. A CO2 level of 7-10% will render you unconscious. Unfortunately, 10% of 2.72 litres is 0.27 litres, or 270ml. So that's about a minute and change before you fall unconscious.

Assuming that the Bubble-head charm can release CO2 but not allow more O2 into the bowl then your chances are looking better. In that you have about 5 minutes before you have no oxygen left and you fall unconscious.

Given that Fleur and Cedric were able to use the bubble head and stay under the lake for an hour and the distance between Hogwarts classes is probably longer than five minutes, the Charm must have the ability to extract fresh air from outside itself as well as expelling the CO2.

+please note, all figures have been gathered with minimum googling and I am in no way shape or form a mathematician so please take this with a grain of salt but, you know, don't stick your head in a fishbowl probably+

***** Interesting, and definitely something that I myself missed, rather foolishly at that. Though, with this sub's disposition towards hating on Rowling for her "poor math skills", I'm hesitant to say that this is incontrovertible. That said, I see why authors would have it as a source of air. Still, it'd be nice to have it directly mentioned somewhere how it works.

** Harry did not use the spell. It was Cedric Diggory and Fleur Delacour in the second task who used it.

Yes it is suggested that it is used as an air purifier spell though people with bad breath have reported problems after 30 minutes. Otherwise it can be used for underwater exploration and to avoid nasty smells.

In OotP the students of Hogwarts used this spell when they were rebelling against Umbridge by throwing Dungbombs and Stink Pellets.
