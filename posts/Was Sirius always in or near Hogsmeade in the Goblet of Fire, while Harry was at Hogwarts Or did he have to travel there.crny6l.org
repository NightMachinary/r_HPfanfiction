I need help. Was Sirius always near Hogsmeade during Goblet of Fire, or did he have to travel to Hogwarts, when he met the trio at the cave?

Edit: I suppose what I am asking is was he at the cave at the time of the Second Task, in February, before he asks Harry to meet him (in March, I looked that up).


** He wasn't at the beginning. When Harry writes that his scar hurts, he comes north and then yes, stays in Hogsmede in the caves. He worked the arrangement out with Dumbledore.

** Pretty sure he didn't get to Hogsmeade until around the time he contacted Harry to meet him.

** He traveled there. You note Harry sent him a letter at the beginning of the book.

*** Yes, he traveled at the beginning, but whether or not he was in Hogsmeade at the time of the Second Task -- weeks before he met with the trio in the cave -- is the question.

**** OK, so I checked my book. It wasn't explicitly stated, but Sirius sent a letter on February 22nd asking about the next Hogsmeade weekend.

They met in March, so I'm assuming he went around that time.

**** Unknown, as in canon it wasn't narratively important. You can do what you want though.
