** Depends on a relative of which character. I'd raise an eyebrow if it's Hermione's sister or brother. However, if it's a distant cousin to the Crouches, or a sister to Evan Rosier I'm perfectly okay with it. No need to shoehorn an OC into a prominent character's life, you'd have to explain why they were never mentioned.

** Mary Sue-ness isn't about them being OCs, it's about the OCs being ridiculously overpowered. Many fanfic writers turn canon characters into Mary Sues.

** I think if it's a a distant relative it works. or who they are connected to Graham montaguse brother sounds more believable than dracos never before mentioned sister

*** depends... is it Draco's squip sister, that was never mentioned out of shame and she was pushed away early once they knew she was a squip...

But yes you have to work really hard to make a relative of a main character or prominent character work

** The question is:

Why is there this OC? What perspective does this OC bring with it? And how and why should others be interested in this perspective?

** My preference for OCs are that they are meant to be fill-in-the-blanks characters. So they're never supposed to have a major role. So it doesn't really matter if they are a relative or just come from nowhere. It depends on the situation.

**** I dont think that would matter because the wizarding world is a big place so there are dozens of students that Harry has never heard of

â€‹

so if they were in a new school or different era it probaly wouldnt matter

** Depends on what the OC is for. In my opinion:

If it's just an extra friend at Hogwarts, I'd rather pull a named OC or have it be a relative of an existing family.

If it's a "Harry raised by X" story, there are quite a few wizarding families that are barely mentioned and OCs from those work decently as long as you integrate them well.

If it's an extra auror/order member training Harry, it's fine to make up a complete OC as long as you don't give them an edgy name/backstory.

If it's Harry befriending a Death Eater, I've surprisingly enjoyed the few fics I've read where Delphini Riddle was born around Harry's time. She /does/ have more canon presence then the majority of characters (although she's the one case where canon should be tossed into the trash, imo) and it's a bit easier to suspend disbelief over a powerful teenager if it's the daughter of Voldemort.

The one case where I absolutely can't justify an OC are the fics where Harry is raised elsewhere, and the fic focuses a shitton on OCs. Especially if you're 30k words in and you've yet to see a canon character besides Harry.

Generally though, just don't give them an edgy name/backstory.

** Depends if its an "oh we need to get rid of a dragon? Imma owl my very plot convenient dragon handler brother Charlie" or just a character being introduced and later being important due to Chekhov's gun.

** I always do a OC with it's own background and group of friends. The canon characters I only incorporate in a third base kinda way.
