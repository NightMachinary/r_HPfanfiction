The self insert I'm speaking of, that I found quite good, if a little cracky at parts, was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3695419/1/My-Gilded-Life][My Gilded life by Skysaber]].

An author with an interest of fanfiction pops into Harry Potters world as Lockheart before second year, and ends up effectively training himself and several other witches and wizards including Harry Potter in spectacular semi-believable ways (partially using knowledge gained from fanfiction, as well as his (the authors) own very good ideas) saving the magical world more or less.

Though in the end...How he finishes things.. It's if not unique it's certainly close to it, and no he doesn't just memory charm everyone (though he does use that a lot), and he goes about things in a mostly rational, logical manner unlike most wizards (and then screws that up by going insane and destroying most threats in a very unconventional manner, though it was hilarious to me)

I've also read a couple others that I didn't find very good, seems the old opinion is true, at least most self inserts aren't very good. A curse of truth was alright, but only alright.


** Holyshit that is actually pretty terrible.

He kills the Dusrleys in cold blood like it was nothing, this includes an innocent eleven years old.

Let that sink into you

*He kills an eleven year old kid because he bullied his cousin*

This quote is priceless

#+begin_quote
  Once things were placed on that footing I was able to absolve myself of guilt on that matter and continue on with my life.
#+end_quote

he sounds like a high functioning sociopath.

Now i admit the guy has decent writing technique but then he starts fixing harry's problems in the matters of a few hours, getting Petter and Barty C. JR. in the same days and nobody thinks that's suspicious

but lets continue reading this trainwreck

#+begin_quote
  I, on the other hand, was of a considerably stronger sort. I had already taken blows that had destroyed me and rebuilt stronger each time. My beliefs and faith in God had brought me through in spite of my trials.
#+end_quote

Ok i'm done dropped like a bass

I'm not religious at all but he believes in God but aparently has no qualms on killing an innocent boy?

FUCK THAT SHIT M8

I'm out

Edit: just to say that the idea of the story is actually pretty good and could be intersting if done well.

** The one you list is the only good one I know of in the HP fandom. A long series of "meh" ones can be found on [[http://www.siye.co.uk][SIYE]] by Spenser Hemmingway. He's a site mod who submits a new SI story for each bimonthly contest on the site. I never thought much of them, but some people must like them (though the humor falls pretty flat to me, they seem to win the contests more often than not).

If you don't mind recommendations from other fandoms, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/315314/Silver-Queen][Dreaming of Sunshine]] by Silver Queen is a Naruto SI that's quite good. Also recommended is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8774090/1/Reincarnation-Roulette][Reincarnation Roulette]] by the same author.

*** Naruto and SG1/Atlantis are the only other things I read fandom from normally, so I'll definitely give those both a try, thanks.

**** If we're talking about Naruto OC SIs, I've got Vapors (and sequel Clarity, very popular) by ElectraSev5n and Fire Rebirth by Nanosilver (not so much but even better imo) for you. The latter is abandoned though, I believe, and nowhere near as long.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8586147/1/A-Curse-of-Truth][A Curse of Truth]]. Author gets put into book 4. Complete, 200K words, very nice.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9399640/1/In-Bad-Faith][In Bad Faith]]. Author gets SI'd as Draco Malfoy's younger sister. WIP, 70K words. Technically sound and enjoyable to read.

*** I enjoyed both of these. As far as self inserts go they are pretty well written, but that's not saying much.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4437308/1/Neville-Longbottom-and-the-Harry-Potter][Neville Longbottom and the Harry Potter]]

Bit long, has pacing issues if I remember correctly and the SI isn't too proactive.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8324961/1/Magical-Me][Magical Me]]

Same premise as the one you linked

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4499794/1/Being-Gilderoy-Lockhart][Being Gilderoy Lockheart]]

Again same premise

There is also a pretty long one called a matter of force, where the SI is harry's twin sister, but it is non serious and a bit cracky (one plot point is taking like 5 chapters / a few months, in a time travel device with 15 people to learn how to play rock guitars, blegh, no one would agree to that in real life). I didn't really like it.

** Aborted around chapter 11. Too many rants and self righteous crap. Also, rewritting 10 years of memories, with no problems. Sorry, no.
