I can see Harry as a Hufflepuff to be honest. He's a hard worker and dedicated (admittedly to the things that interest him/are needed for him to learn/do). DA/Patronus charm/etc.

He's pretty fair, a mediator with people/peacemaker. He can be sarcastic/a trouble maker. But most of the time, tried his best to stay out of trouble, until the plot demanded it.

What do you think? Is Gryffindor the perfect house for him? Do you think he'd be better with another House? How would being in another house affect his personality/behavior/interactions etc.


** I think Gryffindor is the perfect house for him because of /how/ he choose it.

He was basically a terrified 11 year old who was starved for attention his whole live. But the only thing he said was "Not Slytherin" - after being told it was the "evil house". Sure, all things considered this is pretty biased but Harry, terrified about his place in the magical world got offered doing "great in Slytherin". And instead of leaping to the opportunity of being great he chose just "not being evil". If you consider his live until to this point that really takes leaps of bravery.

So yes, while I see that Harry has potential for each house: he can be studious if he neds to be, he can be cunning and ambitious and he also can be a hard worker and is very loyal - in the end being brave is what he chooses. So Gryffindor is the best choice.

** Hot take: I don't think there should be a House system at all. It's borderline segregation, and while I doubt there's any rules explicitly stating that students cannot mingle with those of other Houses, in practice it seems like it almost never happens outside of specific events.

*** ‘Borderline Segregation' is taking it a bit far. It's not the House system that is the problem, but the way Fanon and to an extent canon, treats it so rigidly. It seriously lacks nuance. Is there a problem with the virtues extolled by the Founders? No, they are all good virtues to have.

Is there a problem with separating according to those virtues? No, the intention is to place like minded folk with like minded folk, to foster friendships and create a cohesive unit for teamwork. That's why inter-house sports are encouraged.

This is an instance of the fault being not with the system itself, though it is falsely attributed to that, but with the staff who are in positions of authority over the Houses. It is the Head of House's responsibility to ensure that toxic attitudes do not fester from within. The role of Head of House, is primarily one of Pastoral Care, and they act in loco parentis (In place of parents). P.S.E (Personal and Social Education) is taught by your Head of House for instance and they are supposed to be your first port of call if you have issues, such as stress, depression, disability etc, or if you have issues with other Members of Staff i.e. (in an ideal world, Harry should have gone to McGonagall with complaints about Snape).

However, the fact is, if Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education actually inspected Hogwarts, both Snape and McGonagall would likely fail. Snape on obvious grounds of unprofessional conduct and it would be recommended that he be fired or removed from a position of Pastoral Care. McGonagall would in a fair world be cautioned for being dismissive of Pupil concerns. Realistically, it is not Dumbledore who does the damage but Snape and McGonagall.

For an example of what a real house system is in practice, with competent Heads of House, I will speak from personal experience. My old private school had four key virtues; Integrity, Compassion, Aspiration and Academic Rigour. Now, we were not separated based on those virtues but we did have four houses: Kilallan (Blue), Craigmarloch (White) Strathgryffe (Yellow) Duchal (Red)

We actually used to compare ourselves to the Hogwarts Houses. My house, Kilallan was compared to Ravenclaw, Strathgryffe and Duchal were Hufflepuff and Gryffindor respectively. Craigmarloch was our Slytherin, because they kept winning on points. We disliked them purely out of sporting rivalry and the spirit of competition and nothing else. A little competition is healthy. In terms of house activities, there was the Swimming Gala and Sports Day, which was split into House teams, organised by the House Captains. House Assembly happened once a month, and Charity Events were organised by each year group, also in houses. We would also help out the local community as part of our Houses. Each First Year was also assigned a ‘Regent' or mentor from the Sixth Year. I.e. Each Sixth year was a Regent, for a First year and a Prefect of the School. The Regent system was in place to mentor the first years and to provide a place to talk, if you weren't comfortable going directly to your Head of House.

In terms of classes, lower year classes were separated roughly on House lines. After choosing your subjects, it was a bit more of a free for all. Extracurricular activities were outwith the houses too, so plenty of opportunity to meet different people.

Was the system perfect? Christ no, but it worked damn well for what it was.

The problems of the Hogwarts Houses are not inherent but through lack of discipline and the failure of the Staff to do their jobs properly. Toxic People existed everywhere. Malfoy and his ilk in Slytherin, Zacharias Smith in Hufflepuff, the Bullies of Luna Lovegood in Ravenclaw and Cormac MacLaggan in Gryffindor.

I think you'll find that canon is the /primary/ offender there. Some fanfictions try to give Slytherin a more nuanced portrayal, but canon, sadly, does not. Not a single Slytherin stayed to help at the Battle of Hogwarts. /Not one/ current Slytherin student gets anything resembling a positive portrayal, while the Slytherin teachers either live off-screen, like Professor Sinistra, or are very mixed bags indeed (Professor Slughorn, Professor Snape).

And you're right; the supposed virtues of Slytherin House, cunning and ambition, can be fine things to have. Except that Crabbe and Goyle don't have a scrap of either one. Draco Malfoy, who was sorted into Slytherin the instant the Hat touched his head, has slightly more intelligence but is just coasting on his father's position, without any apparent ambition of his own, and doesn't show a trace of subtlety until sixth year when his life literally depends on it. Pansy Parkinson shows up just to call a few insulting names. Marcus Flint is a brute leading a team of brutes; "he's made a few changes to the line-up and seems to be going for size rather than skill."

All of that is canon, not fanon. I can recommend some fanfiction that does a much more balanced job, if you like.

*** my annoyance is Rowling didn't expand the house system.

each of these houses have existed for a thousand years. and the wizarding world of Britain clearly puts emphasis on them and each house has a different entrence.

she should have leaned into it more, each house should have its own culture. with maybe its own lessons taught up upper years of each house.

instead houses in canon are just where you sleep and eat.

** I'd say yes(he is very modest and humble, and doesn't want to be reminded of fame being BWL, a fine Badger indeed). He would do fine in any house(even Ron and Hermione would also), but maybe slightly less in Ravenclaw(He is smart, but he doesn't pursue knowledge, and isn't that witty, like Luna, who has a drive to prove that creatures no one has ever found exist, and truly believes they do, even though there isn't any solid proof), though he needed to be in the warmer House duo(that being Gryffindor or Hufflepuff, which inspire companionship/bravery/doing the right thing/being utilitaristic, in contrast of Ravenclaw and Slytherin, which inspire individuality/alliances/manipulation/using any means to get to the goal/pursuing any type of knowledge). Also that doesn't mean anything, and it can not influence you fully, cause you can have warmer traits even in Slytherin(Draco and Snape being the example), but in Harry's case it kinda does. He didn't have any interactions with the magical world before Hogwarts. He built himself a stigma that all Slytherins are evil/dark, and that Hufflepuffs are duffers(Hagrid said that in the first book, but that's thanks to Dumbledore, cause he wanted to lead Harry away from bad choices throughout the series, the Hat after all takes your choice). In conclusion, if we put everything we know in canon presorting as canon, he'd be still in Gryffindor, thanks to Dumby's scheming, but Hufflepuff would have been probably the best house choice for Harry's wellbeing.

** I don't think he's social enough to be a Badger. Badgers always stick together and all that. He'd probably feel suffocated and anxious by all that people sticking by him. He does basically take five years to even remember half of his classmates names. :D

*** I think he really deep down wanted to have friends, and Puffs would have helped him with that(even with his social issues), and if he met Susan or Ernie on the train first, he would have established a connection with them as well(well everyone except canon Draco or pre-troll Hermione). I mean he quickly jumped to be friends with Ron after 5 minutes of conversation.

**** Sure, but I get the feeling he'd be overwhelmed by the lot of them. Harry always did seem quite anti-social to me. Going from no friends to twenty friends would probably be a bit much. Badgers badger, after all. :)

*** Well Badgers are brave(maybe not recklessly jumping into action and having a hero complex like Gryffs, but I'd imagine that they would be reckless in certain situations like Gryffs, example being Death Eaters attacking a village, or a werewolf attacking someone, cause its the right thing to do) also, but every Puff remained at the Battle of Hogwarts(like every Gryff), cause it was the right thing to do. Both houses believe in utilitarianism, loyalty and companionship.
