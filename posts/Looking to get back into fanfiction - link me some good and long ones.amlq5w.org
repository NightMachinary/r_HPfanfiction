Hi. I used to post a lot here under an old account back when things in life were a lot worse for me. I probably read thousands of HP fanfics over a few years. After things got better I became very busy and I stopped reading HP fanfic.

Looking to get back into reading - I've forgotten almost every story I've ever read and I can't find my old fanfiction.net or AO3 accounts, so I can't find the stories I followed. Can you guys recommend good, long fanfics? I don't care about the pairing or whether it has cliches or not. Not really picky about the storyline either, just want to get back into reading.

Thanks!


** Some of my favorites:

[[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=313068][Run]] by [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?uid=193853][Toujours Padfoot]] - Focuses on the dead characters in the afterlife after DH, learning to move on and participating in a tournament with the prize of 24 hours on earth. James/Lily and Remus/Tonks.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189/chapters/278342][The Changeling]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/766017][Armistice Series]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Annerb/pseuds/Annerb][Annerb]] - The first fic is a character study of Ginny as sorted into Slytherin, and the second is a series that follows Harry and Ginny after the war. Harry/Ginny (the romance is focused on in the post-war series, but not much in /The Changeling/).

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16126862][Wolf, Wolf]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/felix_atticus/pseuds/sebastianL][sebastianL (felix_atticus)]] - Remus, following DH; canon compliant character study. Remus/Sirius.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/518884][Let Perpetual Light]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/tehtarik/pseuds/tehtarik][tehtarik]] - Not compliant with /Fantastic Beasts/, but I prefer this backstory. Follows the Dumbledore family from Kendra's funeral to Ariana's death. Dumbledore/Grindelwald, but the main focus is Ariana.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/927712][Common Woodbrown]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/imochan/pseuds/imochan][imochan]] - Remus raises Harry and realizes Sirius is innocent. Mostly a Remus character study focusing on his lycanthropy. Remus/Sirius, but it's pretty minor.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6246406][Not From Others]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/FloreatCastellum/pseuds/FloreatCastellum][FloreatCastellum]] - Follows Ginny during DH; canon compliant. Minor canon pairings.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/36505][Pieces Universe]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Realmer06/pseuds/Realmer06][Realmer06]] - Series of stand-alone interconnected fics spanning from book canon to the next generation (not /Cursed Child/ compliant). Canon pairings.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/58157][Stealing Harryverse]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/copperbadge/pseuds/copperbadge][copperbadge]] - Alternate universe in which Remus and Sirius raise Harry. Starts pre-/Philospher's Stone/ and and continues until 3rd year, after which the author summarizes what he wanted to write for the other years. Remus/Sirius.

** Now a lot of these recommendations are copy-pasted from my post history so if they have warnings like "/He does have a adoptive sibling though./" that's leftover from me giving cacots.

first there's a lot of good fic recommendations at the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanficRecs/HarryPotter][Tv Tropes Harry Potter fanfiction page]]

 

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8429437/1/The-Perils-of-Innocence]]) This one is nowhere near complete, but is fantastic. Harry is raised from the age of 6 in a home for children with psychological problems.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3160475/1/Harry-McGonagall]]) and its sequel are complete. Harry Is raised by a relative of McGonagall. He does have a adoptive sibling though.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus]]) Harry is raised by the Grangers, Harry does have Hermione as a adoptive sibling though. it is completed its sequel +won't be+ +isn't+ might not be

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4923158/1/3-Slytherin-Marauders]]) Harry is raised by Snape for a few years. it is to quote myself

#+begin_quote
  a long(582,712 words!) and Interesting fanfic featuring dragon worldbuilding, magical Dudley Dursley, a brother like relationship between Dudley, Harry, and Tom R, Lucius Malfoy falling for a muggle, and a grudging respect between Lucius and Arthur Weasley.
#+end_quote

 

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6479080/1/Soul-Thief]]) has Harry as legally a Auror, but more a private investigator.

To quote myself

#+begin_quote
  A year after the death of Ron, A depressed Harry is dragged out of hiding to investigate Draco Malfoy's supposed murder of Cho Chang. Hermione tries to get her friend back. Great teamwork between Harry and Hermione.
#+end_quote

 

the Regulus in Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8895954/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Deus-Ex-Machina]]) is pretty cool in my opinion. Lots of interpersonal dynamics between the Blacks, Regulus Black is basically the main character for the first half.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10449375/1]]) The cupboard series starts in Harry's first year not his childhood, But very much so diverts to its own path.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12388283/1/The-many-Deaths-of-Harry-Potter]]) To quote myself:

#+begin_quote
  Less time travel more do-over, Harry gets the chance to relive the last few months every time he dies. Death is not treated like a slap to the wrist though, less "darn I thought it was going well" more "OH GOD I JUST GOT HIT BY A TRAIN /silently weeps/"
#+end_quote

 

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness]]) Harry is blinded by the killing curse as a baby and doesn't go to hogwarts, Hermione has the speech center of her brain horribly damaged in the troll attack, they meet in a mundane school for the disabled.

 

[[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700][Hermione Granger and The Goblet of Fire]]

#+begin_quote
  What if it had been Hermione's name that the Goblet of Fire spat out? A complex spell cast one summer with the most innocent of intentions results in the Brightest Witch of her Age being entered into the Triwizard Tournament. How can she get out of this?
#+end_quote

Chapters: 21 Words: 287,927 Completed

 

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11916243/1/Escape]]) A marriage law is passed, Hermione has to choose between Snape and Draco. She takes the third option and nopes out of the country with Harry.

well linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8045114/1/A-Marauder-s-Plan]]) is one of my favorites. touches at the black family at points, but at 82% the length of the entire series it touches on a lot of things

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron]]) Lots of worldbuilding including customs, what would fashion look like with magic, and a lot of snapshots of what various parts of the wizarding world look like.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10536445/1/The-Lily-Potter-Foundation]]) Harry makes a foundation dedicated to orphans, education, and equality.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11500936/1/Long-Live-The-Queen]]) With his trial coming up harry decides to go to the highest authority in the land for help.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying]]) Gellert Grindelwald tries to save the day against Voldemort and accidently conquers europe in the process. Funny in a crosses the line twice war crimes way.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again]]) Harry falls back in time accidently. Not wanting to get bored he takes his second time through as unseriously as possible.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12682621/1/The-Parselmouth-of-Gryffindor]]) Hermione Granger is a parselmouth. Because she can recognize snakes sapience she wonders what other thinking creatures are ignored. Her crusade for justice encompasses a lot more than just house-elves. kinda cracky

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12407442/1/Luna-Lovegood-and-the-Dark-Lord-s-Diary]]) Luna finds Tom Riddle's diary and slowly drives him insane. The last ~12 chapters focus on the plot a bit more and less on the humor.

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin]]: Slytherin Harry/Twin Fic, first year is largely a rehash with a few twists, but the second and third year are absolutely fantastic. The exploration of magic, some of the effort put into tying up loose ends and drastically fleshing out the magical world, and the ongoing sense of mystery make it very enjoyable.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.
