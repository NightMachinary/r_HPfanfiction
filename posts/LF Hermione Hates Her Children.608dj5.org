A one-shot where Hermione confides in Harry that she hates her children because they're stupid.


** A mother hating her children because they're dumb makes for an extremely unlikable character. Feeling a bit disappointed that they're not more like her is much more realistic.

*** Faery Heroes is definitely not a oneshot where Hermione hates her children because they're stupid.

**** Is it a good story though?

Wait...is this the fic where Santa Claus makes them travel back in time and there's all sorts of faeries in the story, or am I mistaking it for another story?

***** It's readable and entertaining, but deliberately and explicitly pulls ideas from a lot of other stories so you may feel like you've already read it. It swings between being a crackfic (Harry and Hermione holding a secret conversation right in front of Ron by obliviating him every few sentences) and dark revenge (no spoilers for those). You also have to accept the idea of an AU where Ron could choose to become a Death Eater because Harry never bought him stuff.

****** SOS. Send help. My brain's going to explode. I guess I've read so many fics it is getting difficult to distinguish those of similar premises.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny
