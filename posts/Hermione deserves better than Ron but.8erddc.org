** "The girl who has been unwavering and unshaken in her loyalty and camaraderie since their first year at school isn't good enough for Harry. A barely even canon blank slate - *that* is the woman for Harry Potter"

*** I mean, you can make an argument that Harry and Hermione wouldn't work that well in a romantic relationship, and although personally I disagree with that. But even those people wouldn't argue that Hermione doesn't deserve Harry. After Lily, she is the one who made the biggest and most sacrifices for him. If Hermione doesn't deserve Harry, no one would.

If we speak of "deserving" Harry, Hermione is right up there on the peak, romantic compatibility or not.

**** She was the one person who contributed most to Harry's success (after Harry obviously). Not Dumbledore, not Ron, not Daphne, Ginny or Fleur. It was Hermione who set a teacher on fire for her friend, who led Umbridge into a Centaur gang rape, who stayed with him when no one else did. Yes, she might not be the most pleasant person to be around, but there isn't a single instance where someone else stood with Harry when she did not (literally no one cared about Death Eater Malfoy and Black did in fact send the broom).

**** Yes. Daphne is confirmed as a pureblood witch of a rich family. And that is it. Thats all of the character there is. So the blank slate has a title and subtitle on the character sheet. Doesn't change the fact that she remains blank in everything that makes a character a character.

For all of Hermione's shortcomings and obnoxious traits, she is still the one who always stood by Harry, always looked out for him, always held his banner high, always walked the most challenging, deadliest paths with him. Even the one time she "betrayed" Harry's trust she did it out of concern for him. She was even right about it. It was just that nobody knew Sirius Black wasn't actually out to kill Harry.

If you're the type of person who throws away a friend who has gone above and beyond for you - even followed you into situations of mortal danger, because she sometimes nags you to do your homework, then you probably don't deserve such a friend anyway.

** I have no problems with Ron/Hermione, and what do you mean with not good enough? 'Not good enough' is not a real criterion, isn't it? If it weren't Ron, I can imagine Hermione together with an OC Muggle, or Muggle-born. I can't think of another canon character together with her.

Regarding Harry, I don't think he's compatible with either Fleur, Daphne, or Tonks. Regarding Harry/Hermione, the books make it quite obvious that Harry never was attracted to her romatically. The two of them have been great friends, with ups and downs, but there never were any romantic feelings from both sides.

*** The books also made it clear that Ron and Hermione were just one or two steps away from murdering each other. Realistically speaking, after the war Ron acted in PoA and GoF, there would be a deluge tearing down the bridge, not just some water under it. Yes, people change, but Hermione isn't really the forgiving type (just ask Crouch Sr).

Edit: The books, even DH also make it very clear that they are still incompatible, even after Ron grew up some. In the middle of a civil war, his biggest worry was that Harry fucked Hermione, not the Hitler ripoff brutally murdering his entire family. That is definitely not love.

Umbridge or Marietta would be better. Or even The Avis incident.

**** It's not that I think it'll change your preconceived opinion, [[http://www.sugarquill.net/index.php?action=goodshiprh&st=keeperofherheart][here]] is a study written in 2004 researching the relationship between Ron and Hermione based on book 1-5. It's even written much better than I could ever have done it, and I fully agree with the study, even if you think it makes me an unsuspecting idiot.

Apparently, you're assuming that Ron's insecurities have nothing to do with the Horcrux he's wearing around his neck.

And if even Rowling admitted that Ron/Hermione wasn't a great relationship, you are fighting for a lost cause here.

Edit: And I did never see the Buckbeak flight as more than a fucked up adventure that never should have happened if Dumbledore had been even remotely competent.
