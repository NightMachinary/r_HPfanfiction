** 100% reader here, I mostly read stuff that could be classified as "serious fantasy AU" - typically long, non-crack fics that generally feel more magical or fantastical than canon, or come a little closer to the modern fantasy tradition. I guess most SFAU could be classified as gen - I don't have an issue with pairings and I like well-written romance arcs, but I don't seek out a specific pairing to read.

In terms of chronology, I read a lot of next-gen and Trio stuff, but I'm not really so big on postwar or Marauders/Founders fics.

*** What usually makes them AUs? Like just canon divergent or changes to the world?

**** Both, I think, but more on the changes to the world. If you look at Prince of Slytherin, which is what I'd consider the most popular SFAU, there's both a clear divergence and a lot of changes to how magic works that trend more "fantasy" than your traditional AU which would trend a little away from the fantasy genre or stay in the same mold as the books. Pureblood Pretense is another example of this.

The same goes with Alexandra Quick or one of the big next-gen series, which are technically canon compliant at the time they came out, but make substantial adjustments to how magic works.

If it makes sense, I think I'd apply this label to fics that are manipulating the setting more than the characters or events of the plot. That's what interests me in fanfiction anyway.

** I love this question. I mainly read Dramione (even though I didn't for a while bc I thought i'd hate it), Draco/Harry, and Sirius/Remus. I cannot read WIPs because I almost always read the whole fic in one night. On Ao3 I almost always filter by completed, exclude crossovers, and hits >10000, plus anything specific i'm looking for.

I had attempted writing a Draco/OC fic before I started reading any Harry Potter fics but now I don't think that I can continue it because i've only read one fic where the insert of an original character fit well. I do really like writing and i've considered writing a Dramione fic because I don't really have the authority to write Drarry or Wolfstar fics.

*** Omg “the authority to write it” is honestly exactly how I feel about those two ships but never thought to phrase it. They're just so popular and so established that I would have no idea where to dive in.

I think for how popular Dramione is, I've never come across one that really hit me in the right way and have never heard of like one super popular Dramione fic or writer that everyone would know of, so I think there's still a lot of opportunity there. OC's are big for second gen because you need to fill in the canon kids' classes, but even then I've always preferred to work with the canon characters given.

** Fics with Specific Ships! I also love fluff+slice of life. I rarely read canon-compliant, honestly. Crack-fics are hilarious.

Any length, but not one-shots. I once found the most amazing oneshot, and it broke my heart when it ended. Never again!

I write fluffy oneshots, LOL, so no. Most definitely not.

I am often split right down the middle for ships, but I enjoy Harmony and Romione fics alike, Lunarry, Nuna, Haphne, Wolfstar.

I actually am a sucker for some tropes, like WBWL. Slytherin fics are always fun to read, but I love Gryffindor and Hufflepuff fics, usually staying clear of Ravenclaw.

** Currently, I almost exclusively write instead of read fics.

When I started my first fic last year, I did two things to prepare for it: I re-read (audiobook) the series starting from OOtP because I knew my fic was going to start right at the end of fifth year, and I intentionally stopped reading fanfiction so I didn't accidentally bring in elements from others into mine since I do write the same type that I liked to read (Snape and Harry mentor fics). I figured once I had a good start on my own plots, characterizations, and writing style, I'd start reading again, but since ultimately I'm writing the story I want to read, it has made getting into anything else extremely difficult.

When I do read, I've also found that where I used to like the long, multi-chapter fics (which is what I write), I now prefer shorter ones. It makes finding a realistic mentor fic difficult because realistically that can't be rushed and done well at the same time. Overall, sometimes I wish I didn't start writing because it kind of ruined my reading hobby. I do love writing more, though, and when I finished my first fic, I practically grieved over it and itched to start another, so I try to remind myself that from time to time.

So to answer your question, I do write what I used to read: Snape and Harry mentor fics, end of fifth year or later, no real pairings (or secondary to the storyline), and the longer the better.

** I used to only read in the 8k-30k range, but these days if it's less than 50k words I probably won't even start it (unless the summary is super tempting). I hear oneshots can be quite good, but in my experience they usually either don't leave an impression or just feel like a teaser for a larger story I don't get to read.

When it comes to pairings I'm not too picky about who's relationship I'm following, but I do avoid certain /kinds/ of relationships. Poly/harem, incest of any sort, significant age gaps (particularly student/teacher) etc are all no-go for me.

WIPs I try to stay clear from, but alas I'm currently invested in two ongoing works and the wait is killing me. Yes the excitement is another level when that email arrives, but I still hate the wait and the uncertainty.

A difference I noticed between the stuff I read and the stuff I write is that I tend to focus on characters and personal development in my own stories while I look for plotty-plots-woven-with-many-a-subplot in stories I read. Also I love relationships and intimacy in the stories I read whilst my own stuff is basically asexual and mostly devoid of romance (Is gen the term for this? Lmk)

Edit: an addition.

I do think that remus needs to be more help in sirius and harry bonding fics. I also like the ones where harry gets kidnaped and tortured. I don't mind ships but most of the time in those fanfiction, I only like ships like wolfstar, rarry, drarry, etc. I wish there was more one wit Fenrir Greyback. I wish there was more like this.

** I tend to read Draco/Harry for the high quality and amazing fics. Like you pointed out, so many amazing writers have created amazing stories with Drarry that are beautiful and great. I also like to read Sirius/Remus and Draco/Hermione too. I really want fics to be 80K+ but prefer over 100k if possible. Everything on AO3.

I do write Draco/Hermione (sometimes George/Hermione). Mostly I stick with that ship because I'm a woman and feel a little funny writing M/M pairings, especially because I prefer my stories to have some sex. And.... I like writing Draco earning a redemption :)

*** Yess love earned redemption. My sister roasts me so hard for it now whenever we read or watch something other than Harry Potter, she'll always point out the best redemption arcs. I almost started a Drarry fic recently, but then she pointed out that his redemption arc would be improved if he doesn't actually get what he wants at the end, so now it's been transitioned to Scorbus (my fave) and I think I might just Rolf him in the epilogue.

Do you have any Sirius/Remus recommendations of similar quality to Shoebox, if you've read that (which you definitely should if you like them)?

I tend to enjoy most Wolfstar fics I read (just by sorting the pairing by kudos on AO3) but I can only read them every now and then otherwise I go into a cycle of depression because of all the sad canon compliant endings :( Of course, All The Young Dudes is my favorite.

Also, I don't think a redemption arc is ruined if Draco gets Harry at the end. Perhaps he doesn't get something else? Like his place in society back, or perhaps his parents remain in Azkaban, or his family disowns him. I feel like there are a lot of storylines that could be created without Draco getting everything he wants at the end.

And I agree that there's a lot of ways to handle his redemption, especially in terms of his relationship with his parents like you said. If you have seen something like this and have any recommendations, I'd love to read something where the press just devours him and Harry. I feel like that's something that's consistently alluded to, how the press will react, but I've never seen anyone treat it as a central focus of the story.

** -I really love gen fics- Trio centric fics (oneshots) specifically. I only read Harry-centric though, as I just can't be bothered about most other characters or their life stories.

-I read a lot of WIPs. I wouldn't have read half my favourite fics if I only read completed ones tbh.

-I search for fics through recommendations, mostly, but most of the fics recommended here are (excuse me) not that good. I also go sorting by bookmarks, by including certain tags and relationships that I want to see (Fluff, Harry Potter & Ron Wealsey). If I find an author whose fics are good enough, I check out their other works, and then their bookmarks. Found a lot of lovely fics this way.

-I have never read any marauders era fic, and I'm pretty sure i'm missing out on a lot, but I just can't read anything about anyone other than the trio, with a few exceptions.

-Which era do you like? I used to like Hogwarts-era, but stopped reading them after a while- there's only so much you can do in hogwarts, so then I moved onto post-hogwarts fics, which is what I mostly read now. I have read one pre-hogwarts fic that I absolutely adore- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1136716/chapters/2298467][Hello Journal]].

-Dimension Travel and (Non-Peggy Sue) Time Travel are my favourite type of fics. Canon-divergence and Peggy Sue I don't like that much because the usually turn into canon rehashes- there only too many times you can read Harry and Ron saving Hermione from the troll.

** I read mostly gen and I tend to look for pretty original if slightly crackish ideas. Actually my favorite ones are the ones that start from a crackish premise but actually develop into serious plot. I don't care much for romance and I prefer that it stays in the background.

I would occasionally read a story focused on romance particularly if it involves a dysfunctional or abusive relationship (one of the many traumas my emotionally abusive ex left me with I suppose). I don't really care which ship it is because at the end of the day they are still the same characters as the writer writes them regardless how they are named in the story, but I'll admit I completely stay away from harems and I've only overlooked a main slash ship when the story was really good and the romance was in the background.

As for topic preferences I like mostly things that are kept within mostly canonical setting and people dynamics build on what's in there but mostly I like to read exploration of the deeds of minor characters such as wizards that appear on the Chocolate Frog cards or other characters that get mentioned more or less on a regular basis but little information is given about them. I like my stories to be below 200,000 words because I don't like to commit to a long story that I will end up hating half way through. There were of course a few exceptions that got me so hooked from at first that I could not stop reading through 500,000+ words.

** I love most HP fanfics, but I have a soft spot for fics where Harry gets to have a better relationship with Sirius or where the adults in his life actually care about him lol. I also tend to like fics where it's acknowledged that Harry is very young and would probably have a certain amount of issues by virtue of his upbringing/almost dying every year.

Interestingly enough, I started writing about 2 months ago and since then I haven't been able to read HP fics. I've been reading Marvel instead (which is very OOC for me).

My fic is basically just wish-fulfillment for me because I always hated the way OOTP went down so I'm re-writing it (I plan to write 6th and 7th-year sequels as well). I added more magical theory, more Sirius, and Harry being awesome while also acknowledging that he has some problems. I also ended up pairing Harry with George because I've read a few of those and they are actually quite good.

One of my biggest complaints with the epilogue was that Harry is just fine after going through all of that for seventeen years. Then Cursed Child came out, and I was like, "Woah, this isn't my Harry," until I appreciated that they were actually trying to approach Harry from the angle that never knowing a real family and being hunted by a dark wizard for seven years would have a big effect on the way he interacts with the world.

** I've never written a Harry Potter fanfic but I have been toying with the idea of a Pootie Tang crossover. Mainly because I want to have JB and Lacey talk about the Harry potter world, Biggie Shorty comforting Harry after 4th or 5th year, and some witch (can't decide who would make the scene funniest).go all elbow-butter-Ginny over Pootie then tackle him into bed. And there are, as far as I can tell, zero Pootie Tang fanfics which is really a shame.

But I actually don't read many crossovers and not much crack.

I prefer long: when I search ffn I always start at >100k words and I usually sort AO3 by descending word count.

AU (time travel ok) or post-Hogwarts primarily, though I do enjoy wish-fulfillment smut (and/or) Harem fics sometimes. No marauder-era, and canon-pairings only if they break up or Remus dies while Nymphadora lives (or if Ginny's part of Harry's harem). About the only dramione I've ever stomached was The Green Girl, which is actually really good. In genwral, though, even if the MC (be it Harry or Hermione) is in Slytherin, I can't suspend disbelief enough to read a story where Draco isn't scum. On the other hand, post-war Hermione/Narcissa is something I do like (Recovery, Worth Saving, Progress Not Perfection, etc.), or Harry/Narcissa for the wish-fulfilment smut. I don't mind bashing, sometimes I seek it out even.

If somebody told me there were a 600,000 word story with consistent verb tenses about post-war redemption/personal betterment & romance arcs for Millicent Bullstrode and Pansy Parkinson with them ultimately happily married to post-divorce Neville and Harry I would drop everything to read it. Unless I decided to wait until I finished the 350,000 word smut where Harry, Hermione, Susan Bones, and the Patil Twins seduce the Widow Malfoy-nee-Black.

I also highly enjoy Harry being sorted into a different house, like Slytherin and politics in general. I like the canon ships, but I also like/love some non canon pairings - what's the most important for me in "non canon couple fics" is, that there is a good explanation why this couple is a couple now, not just putting them randomly together. I read on Ao3, ff.net, sometimes on wattpad (there are some hidden gems there), Livejournal and adultfanfiction.

Write: I wrote a couple of Oneshots and work on translating a story I like to English.

** I am 99% a writer. I don't read much at all, and I thought that was a good thing until recently. I don't read while writing in order to avoid 1. subconsciously plagiarizing, and 2. being intimidated by far superior writing enough to get discouraged. Though, this also leaves me clueless as to what's already out there and whether or not I'm reinventing the wheel most of the time.

Anyway, so far I have written 100% gen, 100% humor. I try to be as canon-compliant and realistic as possible in everything I write (within reason). I am starting to work on a very dark and long fic that is more a character study than anything else, so I'm not sure what genre that would be. Probably horror, by the end of it. I am also in the process of writing my very first ship fic (an uncommon pairing, too) and it is going horribly. /Horribly/.

I used to avoid ships like the plague and was super awkward whenever I tried, and now I struggle to find motivation without a central ship. It's a slippery slope.

*** Is bashing where the author clearly hates a specific character like the Ron the Death Eater trope, or do you mean Harry bashing specifically? Bashing makes me think of Dumbledore because there's such a wide disparity between treating him like a God-like figure (in Cursed Child, the characters literally say "by Dumbledore" and other God expressions) and pointing out the ways in which he used and manipulated Harry.

**** Yeah it's when they make a character unnecessarily dumb or evil and manipulative but usually combine it with massive amounts of ineptitude so they just get dunked on over and over again without ever learning anything. You most frequently see it with Ron and Dumbledore but they'll occasionally throw in Molly, Ginny, and Hermione.
