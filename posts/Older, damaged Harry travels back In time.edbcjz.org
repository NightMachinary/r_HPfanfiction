I'm interested in a fic where a powerful, veteran Harry is missing an eye or a leg or is crippled in some way(like moody) and he has replacements. He travels back in time but stays in the same body.


** Not exactly this,but close enough.

** This sort of happens? His new body ends up being sort of a mixture between his 13-y.o. body and his heavily scarred one.

  Torn from a desolate future, Harry awakens in his teenage body with a hefty debt on his soul. Entangled in his lies and unable to trust even his own fraying sanity, he struggles to stay ahead of his enemies. Desperation is the new anthem of violence.
