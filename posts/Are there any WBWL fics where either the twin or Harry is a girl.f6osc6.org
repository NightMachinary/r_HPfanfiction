Seems like it could be an interesting twist on the standard trope, curious if anyone's done it before!

  Karma is real. It's a lesson that many have to learn the hard way. James and Lily Potter made the biggest mistake of their lives. The daughter they abandoned was more than they thought, and she becomes everything they wanted her twin to be. Belladonna Potter has her own plans for her future and no one will stand in her way. Hard work forever pays. A/N:fem!Harry, Wrong-GWL, Tomarry.

  WBWL Story. Female Harry, warning! Dark first chapter! The next chapters will get better. This female Harry Potter is different from others. Read if you dare and the full summary is inside. The back button is on the upper left-hand corner. I don't own Harry Potter!
