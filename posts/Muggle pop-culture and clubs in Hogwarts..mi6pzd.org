What pisses me off is out of the 300k + works of Harry Potter fanfiction, the number of times I have read someone started a club or repeatedly quoted a pop-culture reference can be counted on two hands. The Hero complex does this to an extent but I want more. I want a full seven years of Hogwarts with muggle students forming all kinds of clubs, book clubs, sport clubs, theatre and music clubs. All that the motherf*cking books have is Quiddich, the frog choir and Slughorns "I schmooze up to you especially" group.

Where is my book club, my theatre kids, music references, movie references, 'yo momma' jokes, sick burns and shit. We all know it would make the fics better


** It's not exactly theatre kids and clubs, but Inverarity's Hogwarts Houses Divided introduces some Muggle concepts into fic. I believe this is mostly makeup, though.

So does Harry Potter and the Lack of Lamb Sauce by imagitory, and The Best Revenge and the (incomplete) sequel Time of the Basilisk.
