I've read a few and my favourite were FILFY Teacher and an incomplete one called "Making a deal with a Devil".

As long as it isn't slash or H/Hr, H/G, i'm cool with whatever setting.


** Damn, I love High School DxD (Bit of a weeb), I've had a few ideas for some and are getting ready to commit them to paper.

I think the best one is FILFY teacher which has already been recommended, I've read through the whole thing 3 or 4 times, it's that good.

In linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11504036/1/10th-Life]]) Harry is entered just after Kuroka went crazy and killed her master, it's crack and fun to read.

Another crack-ish one is linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10596643/1/Harry-Potter-God-of-Gods]]) Harry is the reincarnation of the Biblical God, though sometimes the humour can be jarring and a bit forced. It has been adopted by another author, though I prefer the original.

One which is pretty sweet is linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11976393/1/Sitting-on-a-bench]]), only read it a couple of times though.

Other than that... most of them are poorly written and are extremely irritating to read as they are a bit terrible. I would love to see more High School DxD (And Fate/Stay night) written, which is why I'm working on my own stories.

All 4 fics should keep you happy for a few days.

*** You consider HPGoG a story that isn't poorly written? Wow, I can only imagine how bad the others must be if that's what shines through in this crossover.

**** Honestly though aside from FILFY Teacher, I've never found a really good fic. HPGoG I read as a crack fic the whole way through which made it somewhat decent especially in comparison to others.

  Kuroka had thought she would fail. Her nine lives had been used up trying to save her sister, but it had all been futile. She had resigned to simply escaping, but out of the blue, a random man claiming to be a wizard appears, wielding powers beyond anything anyone had ever seen. With his help, she may just yet be able to save her sister, altering fate. The Master of Death comes.

  What if the Deathly Hallows were always meant for Harry? What if Harry was the reincarnation of the God of the Bible? What if getting the Deathly Hallows reawakened his powers as God? What if that meant Harry was the new God... we're all f*****! Crack fic. Slightly OP Harry.

  Some stories start in the most average ways, and this was no exception. How would things change if a certain Devil shared a bench with a certain green-eyed wizard after a hard day of school? Rated M for safety and mature content in second part.

*** Thanks for the rec, though as I said in the description, I've already read and its one of my favourites FILFY teacher. Which is sorta the inspiration for this post. Thanks though, the one with Koneko seems really interesting.

I'm not a fan at all of humour or crack, so I'll prob skip those. Thanks.

** There was this awesome fic by Rennerd a while ago which he took down. It was a pretty awesome one. It had a pretty awesome fight scene between Sona and Dumbledore (obviously, Sona lost badly) Edit: It was called Harry Potter and the Devil's Sorcery and there are still copies online.

**** It was pretty awesome. It went for this whole thing of wizarding magic being a lot more conceptual compared to DxD magic. As an example, Rias couldn't destroy a pot which had been charmed unbreakable because it's well, unbreakable.

** Well, there is a fic, The Wizarding Lion of Kyoto linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12521313/1/The-Roar-of-Kyoto-s-Wizarding-Lion]]). It has a decent concept but screws up the execution of it.

The other is linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11723597/1/Sacred-Magic-Wizards-and-Dragons]]). This has Harry with Divine Dividing. It's good but hasn't been updated in a while.

If you're fine with DxD crossovers with other series, there are more options. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10710606/1/A-Demon-Lord-s-Hero]]) is a brilliant story but hasn't been updated in a while.

*** Depends on the other series, and if its multiple crossover, then no. I hate when that happens. I've tried reading Naberius Heir (bleach x DxD) but both Ichigo and Rias are so tedius that I couldn't keep on reading.

I'd prefer, if she's a main character, a more inteligent Rias than what shows in canon, which is basically a lazy bimbo, imo. At least in the begining.

I also hate power wank for no reason at all, so when it went into Ichigo being a Quincy-Shinigami-VastoLord-Devil quadra combo, I just barfed and quit.

  A Harry Potter who has tried to take control of his destiny from second year on finds himself in need of a fresh start due to his marital status changing abruptly. Armed with some abilities beyond the norm, a Mastery of Defense and a muggle-style teacher's license, Harry takes his daughter Lily Luna and takes a job offer at Kuoh Academy. Pairings undecided save Harry/Rias/many?
