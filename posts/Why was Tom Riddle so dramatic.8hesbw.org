i.e. creating a dumb name calling his followers 'Death Eaters' and 'Knights of Walpurgis' tattooing his followers dramatic monologues flowing robes unnecessary drama trying to get at Harry when he could have just ordered his followers to cut off Harry's head and bring it to him etc.

  The simple ideology of Harry existing and surviving kept everyone going on.

That's so dumb I wish they lost just because of it. "Oh harry's dead. It's over. Oh he's actually alive! We can do it!"

** Telling your followers to cut off a child's head is pretty dramatic IMO.

*** lol but its far more effective than using magic to kill him and going after him yourself after you failed so many times already

if tom riddle were a real person, he'd wonder why his previous attempts at killing harry potter went wrong and then improve his methods

** Well, you're not alone in your opinion. Voldemort's flair for drama and style have been poked fun at in several fanfics. Though I can only personally mention Methods of Rationality (Where the drama is deliberate and addicting to Voldemort) and Seventh Horcrux (where the whole "death eaters & Voldemort was just a huge drunken rampage)

As to why Rowling made Voldemort so dramatic? I think it's more fun to read that way. When Voldemort is on the scene (or described) he is clearly a villain, torturing and killing all over the place, taunting his enemies and seeking out his nemesis (for seemingly no fucking reason). Voldie has pretty limited screen time, for a main villain across seven novels, so this concise and clear communication can be considered a good thing.

If you're looking for a complex or sympathetic villain in Rowling's novels, Voldie ain't it. IMO that role is filled by the Malfoy family, especially Draco, who I view mostly as desperate and terrified of Voldemort.
