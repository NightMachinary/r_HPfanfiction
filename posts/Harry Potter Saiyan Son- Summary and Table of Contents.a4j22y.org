After a being beaten by his uncle and left in an alley, 5-year-old Harry Potter is found by Bulma Briefs. Noticing his Saiyan biology, Bulma takes him in and Chi Chi trains him. Together with his new friends, Krillin, Gohan, and Bulma, he will travel to Namek on an adventure that will last a lifetime.

Then, after fighting galactic tyrants and cybernetic bio warriors, Harry discovers that he is, in fact, a being of great magical power destined to defeat the evil sorcerer Lord Voldemort. He attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, all while keeping his true Saiyan power under wraps, he makes new friends and new enemies as he solves the mysteries of the magical world and avenges his parents.

This story is exclusively from Harry's point of view, unless Harry is asleep/unconcious, aside from at the beginning when Bulma first discovers him. Magical beings have had their power upscaled, in order for the Saiyan-Who-Lived to have a better challenge, rather than wiping the floor with everything between Cell and Buu, and maybe beyond

** Seriously mate- posting an entire story on the reddit is a pretty good way to get banned. Please don't.

**** No mate- you post your story on FanFiction.Net and you do a single promo post here outlining it. That's how it works.

**** You could make your own subreddit and post it there if you want, but reddit's interface is not designed for reading something like that so I don't recommend doing that. Better to just post the actual story on a fanfiction site, either FFN or AO3, and then make a self promotion topic here.
