*********** Harry isn't from Birmingham, though, he's from Surrey. Where they most definitely say "Mum." And let's be frank: Any time a HP fic has the characters say "Mom" the author is probably not thinking of Birmingham at all. They're probably American and not very good at thinking about the differences between language in the UK and US.

** There is a fanfiction that Harry ends up spreading a rumor about Snape being Dracos father and blames it on the twins. And Draco is like Merlin dammit when he finds out later when they become friends.

I'm 90% sure it is a time travel fic, but I am not sure. I'm going to see if I can find it real fast.

Edit: Linkffn(4536005)

It is a comedy.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
