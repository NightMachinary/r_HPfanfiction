For anyone who doesn't understand:

OTP = One True Pairing (a hardcore ship) OT3 = One True Threesome OT4 = One True Foursome

And Upward. Whatever the number of people exclusively (and physically) involved with one another.

Fanfiction is, at its core, a form of wish-fulfilment. Perhaps Peter grants himself better roles and relationships in his fanficz than what he actually gets up to in the Marauders' real-life real-time escapades and bonding moments. More inclusion and prominence, that is.

Either Peter is the one writing OT4 and he (understandably) doesn't want to be called out on it, or he simply knows what it is through indulging himself by reading that kind of fiction. Either way, his reaction is a little incriminating, lol.

Edit: I can imagine some hardcore shippers glaring at Lily and muttering to themselves about Homewreckers. X3


** Lol omg I love this. I'd think that Peter reads more than he writes, maybe he tried his hand at it but wasn't good so he mostly lurks.

What if there was a ff zine that got published weekly and sent around to everyone who signed up, but it was all top secret using code names. And the zine editors use the room of requirement as their meeting room. Or instead of sending it out, they just hide copies in places the community would know to look. One in the restricted section, one in the bookshelf in Bins' classroom, one under a carpet in each house common room, etc etc

*** I can definitely see Peter as a lurker. I could also see him collaborating with a better author to put out what he wants to see in the Marauders Fandom. I could see him getting into characterization debates in this and other Fandoms. I could also see Sirius' playboy rep get wildly out of hand by wannabe GFs in that fandom. SI-Romances, SiriusxReader, etc.

Jily & Lames could be an unpopular ship evolving before everyone's eyes. Perhaps some of the works written about them might be used by Peter to impart actual date ideas or dating advice to James.

I love the idea of drop-off locations. Maybe different locations for different fandoms? Got some eager firsties crowding around that bookshelf.... Hey! You Slytherins should know better than to all go for it at once!

I also fancy the idea that there are Star Trek fanfic writers mixed into the Hogwarts FF crowd. I believe that Season 2 of The Original Series (Star Trek: TOS) consisted mostly - if not entirely - of episode scripts that had been written and sent by Fanfiction Writers.

Edit: could you imagine Snape finding a JamesxLily fanfic lying around, or Regulus stumbling across a SiriusxReader Fanfic? The Horror! XD

***** Peter's like that lurker+reviewer type who never writes or publishes anything of his own but still knows what he's talking about while critiquing other peoples' works because he has read so much that he's kind of an expert. üíô (I'm not being sarcastic, here. Readers know what readers want.)

Or he's like that one Guest/Anonymous Reviewer who's kind of a troll who will argue and nitpick everything.

Or both. üêπ

**** What if the whole started with muggleborns writing and sharing ff (since they are cut off from all muggle media and need to get in their fix), but then the purebloods find out and don't really get the concept, so they write ff based on actual people at Hogwarts (ecspecially since many muggleborns have decided to place their stories set in the wizarding world). Then it sort of devolves, and eventually half the school is hooked on Mauraders fics. Well, that and people writing smut about their professors hooking up (hidden in Myrtle's bathroom). Peter, who has been on the ff train from early on, loves reading the fics involving him (obviously the ones where he's at least as good as the others) and starts imitating the version of him he reads about... Very poorly. Also, the number of people shipping James and Severus, with Lily cast as the evil one trying to get between the OTP becomes frankly ridiculous. ~80% of the OT4 stuff is written by Slytherins, but every house loves it. Someone starts writing crack about Voldemort, which becomes a very controversial work that is secretly enjoyed by almost everyone. Graduating students can't think of the Dark Lord without laughing, and recruitment drops sharply. Peter is making such a fool of himself (and has become convinced that the other three are all sleeping together) that even the other Mauraders can't take it and they drift apart. Quite a few fangirls (and boys) keep trying to set James and Severus up.

And then, one day quite a few years later, Harry stumbles across one of the few ff still laying around the school, as the trend has died off by now.

***** Yes. . . .Yes. . . .*/Yes./* Somebody write this, please!

~{~<¬°>~}~ Current hyped-up smut fic is a steamy Dom!Argus getting it on with Madame Irma after curfew in the Restricted Section of the Library. They're more in heat than Mrs. Norris! First fic by PURPLEHouse. *(PWP. M-rating, duh. Updates once a fortnight; every second and fourth Saturday of the month.)* Meanwhile, in our latest chap of popular slashfic "/Star-Crossed/" by NoShipIsAnIsland: James and Severus are set up at Madame Pudifoot's in Hogsmead, but Snape is /such/ a Tsundere and we all /know/ that Potter is attracted to the feisty, argumentative, hard-to-get types.... ~{~<¬°>~}~

(A Skeeter ^ for FF)

And then: Hogwarts Fanfiction comes back into fashion in Harry's fifth year because it becomes a secret outlet for students to get their digs against Umbridge, lol.

Edit: what if one of the Professors (say, Flitwick) actually (secretly) helped to perpetuate some of the Teachers!Fics under a random Penname, and then got the bandwagon rolling again under Umbridge's tyrannical rein?

He wrote the original OT4 Marauders fic and it wasn't very good, esp. the spelling, grammar, etc, but it had a certain spark and it caught on. Now every ff author has written at least one, and some people specialize in them.
