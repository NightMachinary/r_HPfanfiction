** I already think that both Morfin and Marvolo Gaunt are really interesting. Admittedly, it is more as symbols than characters, and for 2 reasons :

- First, they represent the flaws of the Blood Purist mentality. The Gaunt family is miserable, a bunch of paupers living in a shack next to a muggle town, with the son so deranged he can only speak in Parseltongue. Absolutely everyone is looking down on them, including the Muggles they hate so much, and yet they hang on their family past glory, still considering themselves superior to the rest just because they have some family link with one great man dead for centuries. They show how some witches and wizard can put their blood above anything else, because they don't have anything else than their blood (like a worse version of Crabbe and Goyle).
- They also show how much of an hypocrite Tom Riddle is. Not only did Voldemort based the whole ideology of his movement on Blood Purity while being a measly Half Blood, but he also flaunted his status as the "Heir of Slytherin" while having nothing but disdain for the Magical side of his family which connected him to the Founder. By being so miserable, the Gaunt show that for Voldemort, Blood Purism in only a mean to gain power. Even if he truly hates Muggle (possibly because of his uprising, his arrogance, or even the 2nd World War . . .), Voldemort does not truly consider Blood as an important factor, which is why he could promote Half Blood into his ranks (Snape), or mock some of the Purest Blood like the Malfoys or the Lestranges. Had he been talented enough to be worth the hassle, a Muggleborn could probably have been promoted into his ranks.

So yeah, I like the fact that the Gaunt are so miserable there is nothing of interest about them, and I'm afraid that trying to develop these characters could "ruin" this effect. Also, in the case of Morfin, he is so deranged that I'm not sure you could give him any character development without making him an OC with a canon name.

** He's an inbred bigot that lived in his own filth after his sister left. He's so deranged that he only spoke in Parseltongue. He despised muggles, so I can't see him ever forming any kind of connection with Tom. And Tom is pretty much the only person besides Harry that would understand what he's saying. He seems so unstable that any fanfiction version of him would need to be OOC. Giving him a child could be intresting, but OC's related to the big bad are often bad.
