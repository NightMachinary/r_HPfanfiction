See title.

I'd really like to read some fics where Harry's biggest problems are the normal magic-school stuff - Quidditch, his exam scores, the occasional classmate being a git, and/or getting the girl.

There's no Dark Lords for Harry to defeat, no prophecy hanging over his head, no Basilisks for him to stab in the mouth - Voldemort either gets dealt with by the adults, died permanently when he attacked the Potters, or never existed at all.

Preferences:

1. No bashing. It's unlikely for bashing to occur given the nature of the request, but I'm stating it for the record.
2. No Muggle AU, please. I am /here/ for magic.
3. My preferred ship is Harry/Ginny, but I'll take anything as long as Preference #1 is kept in mind.
4. Either recently-updated or completed. I don't like abandoned fics.
5. The longer the better.

*** I /probably/ should have mentioned that this fic inspired the request. I know it, I love it, but I've already read it :-)

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
