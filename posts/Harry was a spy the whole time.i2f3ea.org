:END:
This fic had Harry's family living and his younger brother was the boy-you-lived.

Dumbledore went to a young Harry and set him up to be a spy.

It was a memory watching fic with Greengrass as a lawyer.

[Side note: Greengrass is so popular in fics because Slytherin was never explored enough in the books, and Greengrass os a great name]


** I think, it is this one.
