I'm currently outlining an AU plot rewrite with a bunch of new shit to the point this might as well be original work but I just don't wanna, I like the characters and world of HP too much. I was wondering if anyone had hints, tips, or tricks for undergoing such a process. Thanks in advance!


** Focus on your characters' motivations and means first. What do they want? How can they get what they want? How would they attempt to get what they want? How do they react to people getting in the way of what they want? What are their principles? How easy would they adapt or change in reaction to events? What are their hangups?

Then check your planned plot for ways to break it. Shortcuts. Out of the box thinking. Double-check if you have some scenes in mind already - would Harry and Co. break into a location to steal something if they could simply buy it? If they can't buy it, why not? Not enough gold? Then any allies of them can't spare the gold either. Which means they are poor, or the item is too expensive for almost everyone. (Which makes you wonder if they couldn't do better at what they are trying to do by selling the thing instead of using it, and using the gold to further their cause. If they can't sell the thing, that once again shapes the world.) If they can't buy the thing because it's unique, then you need to decide who made it - and why no one else, not even Dumbledore can make one.

So, you might come to the conclusion that they wouldn't break into a location to steal an item. But maybe there's a piece of knowledge there they can't get anywhere else? Or they need to free a hostage. But then again, there are alternatives.

*** Thanks for all that!

For character motivations and actions, how frequently would you say that needs updating? Say for secondary characters like Hermione, would it be the entire series with a bit of nuance between books, and for the primary character in Harry, let it change and morph for each book with a bit of nuance between chapters?

**** Each time they appear, check if they changed.
