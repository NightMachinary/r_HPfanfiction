I'm looking for AU stories that don't just change a small part about canon, but have big deviations or take place in another world altogether. Crossover is fine if the focus is still on a HP character.

I prefer the main character(s) to be canon character(s) from Harry's generation. Canon rails are fine if they make sense and the world is markedly different from canon. Any pairings are fine, but please include a warning if there's a huge age difference between the characters involved. I'm not a big fan of stories that pair a character with someone that could be their parent.

Voldemort winning/not existing/properly dying the first time around would also change canon considerably, but unless there's some other big change, I'm not too interested in those stories.

AU examples (those were picked for their AUs, not necessarily plot or characterisation):

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/Reign-of-the-Serpent][Serpent's Reign]] (Slytherin won against the other founders, resulting in a very different social structure in the magical world) linkffn(9783012)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8616362/1/Harry-Potter-The-Last-Avatar][Harry Potter: The Last Avatar]] (crossover with Avatar: The last Airbender; there is no magic, only bending) linkffn(8616362)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2686394/1/Hell-Eyes][Hell Eyes]] (Harry gets transported to a completely different dimension) linkffn(2686394)
- [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] (spy AU without magic)


** Denarian Series is for sure fitting, lots of new magic and places. Love the interaction between Meciel and Harry.

The Star Empire, unique and strange but well written and very very AU

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2740505][Wit of the Raven]] - Heavily AU fic, with an interesting alternative system of magic and more meritocratic Hogwarts. Strong focus on school life and especially school competitions. Dead.

  Fairytale AU. Loosely inspired by Beauty and the Beast. Some said he was once a man, cursed, and some that he sold his soul to demons and became one in turn.
