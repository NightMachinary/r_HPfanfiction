Specifically, the kind that makes Hagrid's menagerie look like a tank of goldfish. Lots of mythological critters that aren't actually supposed to exist, even by Wizarding standards. With Harry's Gryffindor sorting, I could easily imagine him bringing home a Nemean lion (Hercules' first labor) to terrify the Dursleys.


** I think Serpentine might count: linkffn(12459242)

Harry hatches a Basilisk while at the Dursleys, and it uses its gaze on Vernon to help Harry run away to Mrs. Figg.\\
In response, it's arranged that Harry gets adopted by the Tonks family, and gets a primer on raising dangerous magical creatures.\\
He starts a little menagerie of snakes later on, including a Horned Serpent.

It's my favourite "Harry hatches a Basilisk" story simply because it's one of the few that stays light-hearted and doesn't bash anyone.

  The voices Harry heard, those no one else could, were the only ones that spoke kindly to him growing up. They had spread their whispers across the world to rescue him and at last, found a way; by creating a queen of serpents. The birth of the amber-eyed empress triggers a permanent change in Harry's life, as he enters a world of magic that may protect or destroy him.
