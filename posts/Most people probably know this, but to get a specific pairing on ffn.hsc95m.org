** That only works if the author has done a pairing in their story description/information page itself.

You're brave guinepig to sort by favs. on ffn. Although, to be fair, it would be even braver to do so on ao3.

** Unfortunately that only works if the author designates a pairing. I'm sure many authors want to keep it a secret which I can respect, but when the pairing is literally in the story summary it's very frustrating when it's not designated as a pair.

This is a huge reason why I switched to mainly ao3.

*** But then you get the authors on Ao3 that mix up the friendship and relationship. There's a big difference between Name1/Name2 and Name1&Name2

**** Also, used to be when you search for a story on ao3 with the character tag 'Harry Potter', stories that had relationship tag 'Harry Potter/X' would not show up unless it also had the separate 'Harry Potter' character tag, as well. Is this still the case?

***** I think so, but if you search by fandom then it doesn't matter. I don't search by character tag so I'm not 100% sure.

eta: Actually, you're right. If your initial search is Harry Potter (character) then that must be present even if Harry Potter is in the pairing. I suppose that'd be annoying if you want a Harry Potter-centric fic but don't care about the pairing.

**** It's not an issue for me since I search by fandom then narrow it down to the pairing I'm in the mood to read. Furthermore, the category can be selected so if I'm reading Harry/Ginny then I also select f/m which is handy for excluding gender swap and friendship-only pairing.

Sure, I most likely accidentally exclude fics that were tagged incorrectly. But imo it's not worth the time of searching through hundreds (thousands?) of extraneous fics in the off chance I find an awesome fic that was tagged incorrectly. I read HP fanfiction from only ffnet for the first few years and after awhile it became overwhelming to find something which is when I switched.

I'll read pretty much any romantic pairing (slash or straight) except ones with big age differences and incest, so until I run out of things to read I'm cool with my system. But to each their own, I know common ao3 criticisms are the tags spoil the plot too much (valid, but not a deal breaker for me) and it has more slash pairings (probably, I don't know for sure). But any place that lets me easily exclude mpreg, a/b/o, and polyamory has much value to me.

** that's a "relatively" new option, about 6 years I'd say? There's many stories that were written on ffn before that was a thing that could even be selected. I can only speak for myself, but I don't like to edit old fics, so I haven't updated them with that option.
