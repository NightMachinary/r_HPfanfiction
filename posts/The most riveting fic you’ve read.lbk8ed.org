  Harry's doing just fine: being Quidditch Captain and 'the Chosen One' doesn't leave him with time to worry about much besides school and the growing threat of war. He's especially not worrying about the fact that Sirius is dead. Or about an embarrassing, uncomfortable night with a classmate he'd rather just forget. Really. He's fine. Features an eating disorder, other tags inside.

** linkao3(The Second String by Eider_Down) floored me. It was just funny and terrifying and awesome I loved it. One of those "Damn I wanna tell everyone about this!" stories.

linkao3(Of a Linear Circle by Flamethrower) is so huge and dense and incredible that I just cannot believe someone puts that much effort into writing anything. Absolutely amazing story and the author terrifys me.

linkao3(All The Young Dudes by MissKingBean89) was the first fanfic I read an holy crap it set the bar. I read it twice in a week and have reread it many times over since. Wonderful story.

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise! PLEASE DO NOT COPY TO WATTPAD. SERIOUSLY, WHY??

** linkffn (Consuming Shadows)

One of the best Tomarry fiction I've ever read. Tom is not a cheap fake and Harry is a very dynamic character and he is well created.

** I am not a big time travel fic fan but there was one where Harry goes to the past. The worldbuilding and the original magic introduced is so amazing. And Tom is described really well... he is really charming and loved and respect by everyone (his gang follows him out of admiration and not fear like most fics depict their dynamics), but he has a really dark and depraved side. Unfortunately never got to the end of it and can't link it since there is a scene in which Harry insults Tom and in retaliation, Tom has his gang hold Harry and proceeds to brutally rape him. That's probably one of the best fics I've read but unfortunately that scene killed it for me.

Also some of my two favorite fics, which are not that well known, are Pitry's "War is Over" and "Inter Arma" which read almost like eighth and ninth books (albeit the second one is next gen) - linkffn(7374621), linkffn(7961051). It's the closest writing style to JK I've seen so far. The inter-character dynamics are realistic, while the characters remain in character and the plot, as well as its twists are really good.
