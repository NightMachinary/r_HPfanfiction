....of course you did....How could I forget that once a Fandom reaches a certain size, for any description of a hypothetical fic there is already a fic written that matches the description.

 

That's a pretty tantalizing summary. I think I'd read it just to find out why in the world Lily had a katana.

  Just before his third year. Harry finds his mother's school trunk in the Dursley's attic. Inside he finds a Japanese katana augmented with several charms and runes and documents he was supposed to have seen his eleventh birthday! Now, armed with his mother's "anti-magic" sword, he will carve his own path and embrace his more Slytherin side in order to defeat Voldemort.

***** OMG; you know that awful story people always complain about and debate is is so awful on purpose or was the author just really that terrible? I made the mistake of starting to read that katana story. O.M.F! I can't tell if the author is a mad genius, or just really unable to write an original story so just regurgitating every awful tropey plot for Dumbledore-Weasley haters. Literally in the middle of one of the chapters they stuck in an AN about how they were too lazy to describe a scene. Later on, some of the dialogue is "blah blah blah." Not...sure...why...I...can't...stop...reading....GAHHH.
