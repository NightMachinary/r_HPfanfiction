:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I can't find it now but Snape decides to leave the Deather Eaters in favor of preserving his friendship with Lily. I don't think it was one where he goes back in time, he just decides to be a better person.

I remember there being a chapter about them taking their apparition test and Lily's dad dies and her family knows Snape and likes him.

If you don't know of this specific fic but know of something similar that would also be appreciated!


** Puh I think I read that and probably have it somewhere in my favorites or follows but there's so many Snape/Lily stories there, it'll take some time looking through it

*** Is it maybe one of those?

The path not tread, the piece not promised, severus snape and the art of war, knight of pentacles queen of wands, chalk outline, ananke, obscura nox animae, the road not taken, cauldrons and lilies, they call this closure?, dreams of future past, tempus vita, forgiveness

**** Link the last fic in your list? Title is not familiar to me.

There's several oneshots with the title, but I assume you're referring to a longer fic?

** Here are the 2 fics that come to mind with Snily without time travel set in Hogwarts years. Unsure if it's one of them, since you didn't give all that much information: linkffn(The Road Not Taken by kellydofc; If Someone Cared Enough)

I don't remember if The Road Not Taken has the father dying (the latter does not), because there's countless fics which is set during this time (basically all of them being Peggy Sue ones) that aren't clearly distinct so I sometimes confuse them with each other. However, I do remember Severus being close with the Evans family in that fic.

I believe that if it is one of those 2, it is the former, because the latter is rather distinctive and more memorable IMO.

  What could have happened between Lily and Severus if he had said the right thing outside the Gryffindor Common Room. This story is AU. Everything you recognize belongs to JKR everything else is me. Rating is for violence, language and some adult content.

  What if Snape had received some better guidance when he was young from people who cared enough to notice what he was going through and looked deeper than the surface? What if there had been Slytherins who weren't aspiring Death Eaters? Would their assistance be enough to help a few young and hot tempered teens? (Slow burn romance)
