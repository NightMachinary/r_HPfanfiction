Is this a rant? I don't think so... I guess it's more a call for discussion? It's definitely not an attack, and I'm not calling anyone out, just here for a good time talkin' ‘bout Harry Potter, so if you disagree that's fine.

I've been reading a lot of comments over the last few days and one thing that sticks out to me is treating personal conjecture as canon. This is pretty common with Albus Dumbledore, so I'm gonna use him as an example a lot, because it's easy. I've read a lot of comments from people who really believe Dumbledore is this evil mastermind orchestrating any and all events of Harry's life from the shadows, with one comment even going so far as to suggest that Dumbledore told everyone that Harry was the Boy Who Lived, effectively painting a target on his head for every follower of Voldemort.

But, I mean, that just not canon. That's a conclusion you can only reach if you assume that Albus is evil and work your way backwards. And I get it really. Albus says and does and doesn't do things that don't make a lot of sense when you take into account the whole of the series, which is a mistake I feel. I feel like you should really just view the series as it came out, one book at a time. The Harry Potter books were fun mysteries for kids, with whimsy and a touch of darkness. Until they weren't, because they grew up with the kids reading them and got more mature, to the point that some of that maturity contradicts or conflicts with the spirit the first few books were meant to be taken in, unless you make some retroactive character changes.

I also personally believe a lot of concepts we see later just plain didn't exist or weren't fully thought out when JK wrote them the first time round. Like the Fidelius Charm, for example.

I kind of hate the Fidelius Charm, because it's the kind of spell that anyone and everyone will think of when a character does a stupid thing, like leave a child with people who don't want him and will abuse him. A lot of people give Albus shit for this, but let's be real here guys, the Fidelius didn't exist as it does in Philosopher's Stone or Chamber of Secrets. Albus didn't use it because it didn't exist as a thing when JK wrote the first two books. It was introduced in Prisoner of Azkaban, because JK needed a way for James and Lily to have been betrayed by a close friend that fit with the facts we already have. And it works, mostly (Apparently Dumbledore offered to be the secret keeper but they turned him down. Far as I'm concerned they had it coming), but by introducing such a spell you retroactively make other characters stupid or evil, even when the text tells you they're anything but.

That's not to say you can't or shouldn't question a character or their motives or anything to that effect, certainly not. I'm not here to tell you you can't make Albus Dumbledore a bad dude in your fanfic. While I personally prefer my characterizations adhering as closely to canon as possible I know a lot of people like that kind of thing. I'd certainly never stand in line for your Dark Lord Dumbledore/Evil Weasley fic, but I'd never kick a man out of that line either. I'm also not telling you your interpretation is wrong and you suck at reading either. But I do think it's important to factor in the intent of the author as well. And I think JK never intended for people to walk away from her books thinking about what an evil bastard Dumbledore was.

And I think it's super important to recognize what's true and what's conjecture. There's a lot that wasn't covered in the books and movies and Pottermore. We don't have a lot of details about the first war other than how it relates to Harry, for example. We see the aftermath but never the juicy bits, and while a lot can be logically concluded from what we've heard there's still a lot of fog surrounding that time period.

Taure wrote a great post on DLP about [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/canon-perspectives-building-up-vs-tearing-down.38920/][Constructive Perspective vs. Destructive Perspective]], with regards to how one engages their fandom of choice. It's pretty great (Really just a better version of this thing, whatever it is) and you should read it, but here's a bit I wanna highlight.

*/Constructive/*

/The fundamental feature of this approach is that it seeks to preserve what has been established. It acknowledges that there are weaknesses in canon (e.g. population numbers) but rather than throwing the baby out with the bathwater, it seeks to find canon-compatible, reasonable solutions./

/The hallmark of the constructive approach is taking canon at face value, then making reasonable inferences to fill in gaps/.

*/Destructive/*

/The destructive approach seeks out problems with canon, hoping to find problems. Where a part of canon can be interpreted multiple ways, and some of those interpretations lead to contradictions/plot holes and others do not, the destructive reader will prefer the interpretation that leads to plot holes./

/The hallmark of the destructive approach is scepticism, which is perhaps why it is so often conflated with "rationality"./

I think a constructive approach is pretty darn dope, personally.

So that's that, I guess? I got nothing else to say anyway. So have a good one?


** The Fidelius Charm is badly writing anyway, in book 3 Sirius talks like the choise was between Peter and himself.

But Rowling never explained why James felt the need to make his friends their secret keeper and not himself. Bill made himself the secret keeper of his house so it works anyway.

I want to add that a lot of people read too much fanfiction and don't know what canon is and fanon anymore. You get tons of message about where harry family fault is if you don't give him one. And that molly send hermione a howler in 4 year and stuff like that that only happens in fanon.

*** Two possibilities.

1. It's not actually Bill's house. It's Aunt Muriel's in the movies, which might've been Rowling's invention.

Given that the Weasleys don't just put the Burrow under the Fidelius and resort to having Arthur be the secret keeper for aunt Muriel's, home, this is probably the answer: You can't pass on your own "secret" to yourself.

Or 2. The Fidelius Charm was improved over the years.

** I mostly agree, but I think the problem is fundamentally more complicated. You mostly say, but I would reformulate that the basic problem is with applying HP universe *as whole* with all years together. When we do that, there are insurmountable problems which cannot be explained away. E.g., we got to the questions like “Why in PS Dumbledore /flew/ to London on his broom?” (hint: even humble Floo was invented only in CoS, apparition is from HBP; yes, something like apparition is shown already in the first chapter of PS, but it is never explained and it really doesn't work as a part of “known universe” until later), “Why there was not at least the age line around the third floor corridor?” (that was “discovered” only in GoF), etc. The mess around the Fidelius Charm is just another example of the same. The results of such logic of applying all information together has to lead to some weird conclusion, manipulative and sinister Dumbledore just one of them.

Logically, when trying to work out your problems while writing your fanfiction, you try to apply all information collected throughout whole canon at once (and that is how for example The Harry Potter Wiki works). However, this approach cannot be applied to deconstruction of existing text, where one needs to apply something like “layered volume-by-volume logic”, i.e., for each problem only solutions from the same volume can be applied.

*** Yeah - and describing it as 'destructive' puts a bad spin on it (and kind of reveals the perspective that the writer had on it). Like if we renamed those two perspective "Delusional" (where we interact with seeming plot holes by trying to patch them up) and "Realist" (where we accept plot holes and decide to change the setting to fix them up), that'd be another biased way of looking at it.

Now, I don't think the description of the two methods is entirely a bad way to look at it - but there's a lot of wiggle room in between the two approaches above, and neither is better than the other. I would prefer to use less biased names for them - something related to the changes, perhaps? Because the 'constructive' one is looking to make canon make sense with the fewest changes and justifications, whereas the 'destructive' one is much more willing to change structural issues with the world/plot/work.

#+begin_quote
  Constructive

  The fundamental feature of this approach is that it seeks to preserve what has been established. It acknowledges that there are weaknesses in canon (e.g. population numbers) but rather than throwing the baby out with the bathwater, it seeks to find canon-compatible, reasonable solutions.

  The hallmark of the constructive approach is taking canon at face value, then making reasonable inferences to fill in gaps.
#+end_quote

and:

#+begin_quote
  Destructive

  The destructive approach *seeks out problems with canon, hoping to find problems*. Where a part of canon can be interpreted multiple ways, and some of those interpretations lead to contradictions/plot holes and others do not, the destructive reader will *prefer the interpretation that leads to plot holes*.

  The hallmark of the destructive approach is scepticism, which is perhaps why it is so often conflated with "rationality".
#+end_quote

This reads as clearly negative to me, and misrepresenting how people come to find issues with the fairly sizable gaps that canon has (and the way that later magic/capabilities would have fit in better earlier, but weren't invented at that point) - as well as why they might choose to expand on canon in different ways, or change it up. Besides which, you could say that building upon canon by replacing chunks is constructive, because you're expanding upon it.

A better classification would be something like a range of change, from 'minimalist' to 'radical' or 'extensive' - where people with a minimalist approach might try to change as little about canon as possible (fitting with the 'constructive' one described above) and 'radical' ones would be more willing to remove and change parts of canon to make it more cohesive.

For instance, let's say someone sees the issue in book 1 with Dumbledore flying to the ministry instead of using a faster method of transport. We know that the real reason, out of universe, is that JKR hadn't invented apparition or the floo network yet. Someone wanting to justify it with a minimal change to cannon could use an approach explaining why Dumbledore might choose to use a broom or a thestral or some slow method of transportation - whereas someone who's fine with change would easily take that section and replace it with apparition - and I would struggle to describe that as 'destructive'.

I'll tell them they suck at reading. Half this fucking sub seems to think only Harry can kill Voldemort and Dumbledore is just using Harry as a weapon.

...Even though Dumbledore literally tells Harry that the prophecy doesn't need to be fulfilled and that Harry can ignore it if he wants.

#+begin_quote
  Is Divination actually a thing that you can actually teach, or isn't it?
#+end_quote

(Watsonian Hat firmly ON)

It might be, but the wizarding world isn't up to the kind of information theory and analysis that would make it actually useful, so it's limited to fairly basic fortune telling and the fact that the current (and, it is implied, former) Divination teacher is a complete waste of oxygen doesn't help any.

As for prophecy, Dumbledore realises (possibly too late) and Voldemort never catches on that prophecies /aren't predictions/. They're messages from Somewhere Else that spur mortals to their fate, often but not always by warning them of it vaguely enough that they flee into danger. Heed a prophecy and you end up accidentally killing your father and fucking your mother, to pick one of the more famous examples.

Trelawney's first prophecy leads Voldemort into the trap that kills him the first time. Her second prophecy unsettles everyone sufficiently that what /should/ have been the apprehension of Peter Pettigrew (who wasn't in any sense of the word 'chained for twelve years' but everyone assumed it was about him) turns in to his escape, and Voldemort is able to come to his final doom.

The /sensible/ course of action on hearing a prophecy is to shoot the prophet and obliviate everyone within earshot. Much trouble is avoided thereby.

****** It's worse than that: he's running a boarding institution, which requires a minimum standard of pastoral care. Which is provided by four people who have full-time jobs of their own, one of whom is the abusive teacher, and another has still a third full-time job on top of that. Hogwarts is /radically/ understaffed, and needs five and probably more like ten more members of staff for the number of pupils they're seen to be managing. Assuming eight hours of classroom time per week and weekends off, the teachers in the core subjects taken through all seven years are able to deliver less than two hours per week instruction to each pupil they have. And that's /before/ they tackle their workload of planning, marking, admin and pastoral care.

Other than the keenest of academic self-starters, the pupils of Hogwarts are being systematically failed by their school.

There are, or must be, other teachers but Harry only mentions the ones who take /his/ classes, an explanation that works from Watsonian (in all honesty I can't really remember the teachers at my old secondary school that I didn't have, and with a couple of exceptions they followed my class from start to finish of my time there) to Doylist (the books would have had to be a lot longer if the non-speaking parts had got any more screen time, it being a truism that every named character adds to the length of the book without necessarily advancing the story, so if they can be decently cut they should be.)

****** There are always things about canon that aren't gonna make a whole lot of sense in retrospect, but we have fanfics that do an admirable job of plothole-plastering.

For example, in HP and the Prince of Slytherin, the author does a FANTASTIC job giving explanations for certain canon plotholes. For example, Snape and his post OWL requirements. Doesn't make sense in canon because you would have to be ridiculously good at potions to get into his NEWT class. In this fic, however, it's because the NEWT class covers topics meant for someone who wants a potions mastery, and would be a waste of time for someone who just wants to, say, become an Auror. For those people, reviewing the skills and potions taught up to OWL level is sufficient to get a NEWT in potions. But this relies on the fics assumption that you can sit your OWLS and NEWTs outside of the canon year 5 and 7, much like you would be able to do in any reasonable society that bases its hiring requirements on those results.

I guess the takeaway is, just because canon didn't explain why something exists, doesn't mean there isn't a reasonable (IN CHARACTER, looking at you evil Dumbledore conspiracy theorists) explanation for those things. My head canon for the continued tenure of Binns is that the Board of Governors is very happy to not have to pay anyone to teach a class, and blocks Dumbledore's attempts at replacing him.

  I've read a lot of comments from people who really believe Dumbledore is this evil mastermind orchestrating any and all events
#+end_quote

I wouldn't go as far as "evil mastermind". Neglectful, perhaps. Passive- definitely. Tired and overworked- possibly.

One of the problems with him is that he left Harry with the Dursleys. And he knew what he was doing. Fics with manipulative Dumbledore often go overboard and into parody and crack. But, damn, canon Dumbledore still left a baby on a doorstep in November to abusive relatives for 10 years. Sure, he makes an excuse about wards, but we're never shown or told if and when these wards actually repelled an attack. Why Harry continues to believe in him and follow him after this is beyond me. While this may not be so bad on the grand scale of things, Harry is the protagonist of the whole series and Dumbledore seriously messed up with him.

​

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore stared for a moment at the sunlit grounds outside the window, then looked back at Harry and said, “Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe and whole, as I had planned and intended. Well -- not quite whole. */You had suffered. I knew you would/* when I left you on your aunt and uncle's doorstep. I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years.”
#+end_quote

​

He didn't increase or consolidate his power between Helloween of '81 and June '95. He probably knew the names of most Death Eaters, yet he did not pursue them and let the likes of Malfoy run free.

He was too passive once Voldemort returned. We are never shown or told of the Order attacking, taking down, arresting or killing Death Eaters. Dumbledore only defends against threats, but never attacks or retaliates. The Order acts more like spies while the Death Eaters actively attack, hurt and kill people.

By leaving Harry's departure from Privet Drive for the last possible moment and using magical means to escape he practically guaranteed that they would run into Death Eaters and have to fight. Think about it- the Death Eaters know that the protection will fall by July 31st. So if their target hasn't escaped until July 30th it leaves two options:

1. He will leave on 31st. In which case have a large force lay in ambush.

2. He will wait some more. In which case have a large force lay in ambush. And attack when the protection eventually falls on the 1st of August.

All the Order had to do was get Harry in a car under his Invisibility cloak before the 30th. But they waited for the last possible minute to extract Harry and used magic thus ensuring the Death Eaters would be waiting in ambush and detect them. I know JK probably wanted an action scene at the beginning of the book but this has to be one of the worst plans ever.

All of Dumbledore's wisdom and planning lead to Voldemort being victorious for nearly a year. By the time of Bill and Fleur's wedding Voldemort had defeated one of his two main threats (Dumbledore), had placed (what he thought was) his man as headmaster of Hogwarts and placed a puppet as minister of magic. And that went on until May next year and the Battle at Hogwarts. Voldemort had practically won for 90% of the last book.

So, no- I don't think that Dumbledore is evil. He is just an incompetent war leader whose inaction lead to the enemy winning. He didn't train Harry. He shared too little information too late. He never took any action against Death Eaters. He never used his positions in the Wizengamot and ICW to pursue Death Eaters or call for help.

It's not a stretch to make Dumbledore evil. A fanfiction trope that bothers me much more is making Ron dumb and evil and making Draco pretty and good. What's with all the hate that Ron and Ginny get? Meanwhile, the little Death Eater shit Malfoy gets away with throwing around racial slurs, trying to get Buckbeak executed, casting the Imperius on Rosmerta, nearly killing Ron and Katie and smuggling Death Eaters in a school full of children. He's not "misunderstood". He's a racist criminal and a terrorist wannabe and I don't care how blond his hair is.

Here is the crux of my problem with your reasoning. It's not just Harry we're talking about. It's /everybody./

If Dumbledore is as incompetent and close to evil as you're suggesting, then that means everyone else is too. Even Hermione. Why does Hermione still trust in Dumbledore through all seven books? I mean, these issues do seem obvious, don't they?

Don't you think that if all this was true, and so obvious as it is, that Hermione would've realized? Especially in the seventh book, when she's an adult and Dumbledore's past with Grindelwald is being criticized?

This is why I believe there /are/ reasons people trust him and believe in him. And it's not like Dumbledore didn't have his moments of cleverness.

The mirror of erised, finding the horcruxes, keeping voldemort distracted in the fifth book with the pointless prophecy, placing snape as headmaster at hogwarts, his method of keeping harry away from gathering the hallows, etc.

#+end_quote

1. The Death Eaters didn't even know the address until they infiltrated the Ministry or Snape told them. (I don't remember which one it was)
2. There is zero evidence of any Death Eater activity between the attack on the Longbottoms in November of '81 and the fiasco at the World Cup in the summer of '94.
3. Voldemort was barely more than a ghost and a baby from Halloween of '81 to June '95 and was incapable of fighting.

All of these lead to Harry suffering needlessly for 10 years. It would make sense for Harry to be moved to the Dursleys /after/ the Death Eaters show at the World Cup or Voldemort regains a body. But in the '80s? The fanatics are in prison, the rest are covering their asses and Voldemort is little more than a ghost. And Dumbledore's vaunted protection did nothing to protect Harry from the "love" of his family.

#+begin_quote
  Here is the crux of my problem with your reasoning. It's not just Harry we're talking about. It's /everybody./
#+end_quote

/Everybody/ doesn't have a close relationship with Dumbledore. Most wizards and witches probably heard as kids from their parents about how awesome Dumbledore is and how he saved them from Grindelwald. Harry didn't grow up with wizards so he doesn't see Dumbledore as a hero until he goes to school. The people who are close to Dumbledore like McGonagall, Snape and Harry sometimes question his decisions and orders.

#+begin_quote
  Even Hermione. Why does Hermione still trust in Dumbledore through all seven books?
#+end_quote

Because while Hermione is smart, she is book smart. She isn't skeptical and cynical enough to doubt adults and men in powerful positions. Harry, being raised by the Dursleys, should have been much more cynical or even suspicious of other adults. In the same line of logic- why did Hermione trust Lockhart, then Lupin (she didn't reveal he was a werewolf), then Snape to teach Harry Occlumency?

#+end_quote

Ooh, boy. Where to start?

- The mirror- Voldemort nearly got the stone because of Dumbledore's lack of foresight. Harry had the stone and if it wasn't for his mother's protection Voldemort would have both killed his enemy and regained a body.
- Finding the horcruxes- he found one- */ONE/* horcrux. And it killed him. And after that he had the absolutely brilliant idea to leave the rest to three untrained teenagers. I mean it's not like he had a whole order of fully trained followers. Harry stabbed the diary, Harry found and Ron stabbed the locket, the Trio stole the cup, Harry found the necklace, Neville killed Nagini and Voldemort killed Harry. (Was that self-harm, BTW?) So while Dumbledore may have gathered some important memories and done research he is only responsible for destroying 1/7th of the Horcruxes.
- Keeping voldemort distracted in the fifth book with the pointless prophecy: Lead to the imprisonment of Sturgis Podmore, near-death of Arthur Weasley and death of Broderick Bode and Sirius Black. Especially fun since the prophecy is worthless as it doesn't indicate who would win or how to win. Just that they would kill each other.
- placing snape as headmaster at hogwarts- lead to students being tortured by the Carrow twins.
- his method of keeping harry away from gathering the hallows- Lead to Harry gathering the Hallows while going to war unprepared, untrained and uninformed.

BTW Have you heard that names of people and places should be capitalized? You should try it sometime- it's great!

​

I understand that war has its casualties and not even Dumbledore could have foreseen every possible outcome. But that doesn't change the fact that Dumbledore was too passive and his plans went wrong or even failed. He might have been a great teacher, headmaster and duelist. He was definitely not evil. But he was a shit wartime leader.

And then didn't even bother to train him up or teach him. A paragon of goodness and mercy, indeed.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore stared for a moment at the sunlit grounds outside the window, then looked back at Harry and said, “Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe and whole, as I had planned and intended.

#+end_quote

Wards are fanon. In canon, the protection Harry is granted by living with the Dursleys is the protection offered by his mother's blood, which saves his life at the end of the first book. It's also what leads Voldemort to specifically use Harry's blood rather than any random enemy's blood to return, which ultimately allows Harry to survive in book seven. Dumbledore's reasoning is pretty decent -- he knows Voldemort is cunning and powerful, and that Dumbledore cannot create any defence which Voldemort will not eventually circumvent. Harry is a child and obviously cannot out-duel Voldemort, so Dumbledore instead equips Harry with a magical superweapon that literally makes it impossible for Voldemort to win against Harry prior to book four.

With that said, Dumbledore could have easily memory-charmed a live-in Uncle Remus or Aunt Emmeline into the Dursley household. Considering what could have been lost if Harry had had his ability to love -- e.g. the /power he knows not/ -- beat out of him by the Dursleys, it is a bit strange that he didn't.

****** I think you're forgetting that Dumbledore didn't exactly have a choice either.

Voldemort was the linchpin that held his side together, through a mixture of fear and awe. In order for his side to be defeated, he had to die. If he was disembodied again, it would only be a matter of time before he came back (likely much faster, as his followers would actually make an effort to find him), and start the nightmare all over.

Then, Albus figures out Harry has a piece of Voldemort's soul in his scar, presumably in book 2. So, he realizes that he either A: has to let Harry die/have him killed or B: let Voldemort be immortal. Obviously he chooses A. There is no way of knowing what he learns researching horcruxes between book 2 and 6, other than tracking down memories of young Tom for clues. We can make some reasonable assumptions though, like how there's no safe way of removing the horcrux from Harry.

Then there's the triumphant twinkle in book 4, a desperate hope for a desperate man. Maybe, JUST MAYBE, Harry can come back from Voldemort killing him. So he starts tracking down the horcruxes in earnest, let's the prophecy orb be a nice distraction for Voldemort while he does so. Except, like all of Albus' plans, this one blows up in his face and Harry ends up in mortal danger again. He comes upon Harry facing down Voldemort, if he just waits for him to kill Harry that'll be another Horcrux down and Harry will maybe (probably) survive.

BUT instead, he deflects the Killing Curse, duels Voldemort til he fails to possess Harry and flees. As much as it would have benefited the war effort, he did not stand aside to let Harry maybe die. Why? Because he's a good person who genuinely cares about Harry but has been forced to make pragmatic choices. Then book 6 and 7 happen, yadda yadda, manipulates Snape to tell Harry about the Scarcrux. And after everything, Voldemort is dead for good, and Harry lives. He may be more than a little messed up, but he's alive, which is more than Albus thought possible to begin with.

This kinda rambled more than I meant it to. Anyway, boils down to Dumbledore was put into the train track dilemma with Harry on one side and EVERYONE ELSE on the other, and due to luck and a quirk of magic, found a third track.

**** One could also argue that Dumbledore had that gleam because as far as Voldemort was concerned, the war was won. Voldemort couldn't kill Harry without becoming mortal, which with time even if Harry died for real, would result in his death. The game was set, all he needed was to move his pieces in the right order.

We over play that gleam of victory. Dumbledore gambled on the sacrificial magic, and the horcrux taking the hit. He was right, but that doesnt change that as soon as Harry was hit with that AK, which was planned from the beginning, the war was won.
