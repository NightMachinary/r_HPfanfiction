** linkffn(The Dark Lord's Equal by Lens of Sanity) technically Harry/Hermione/Fleur, but Fleur only shows up in a few flashbacks. Harry does tell some people - in my experience he comes off as a bit of a jerk if he doesn't.

#+begin_quote
  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED
