What it says on the title. I like self-inserts and I'm tired of searching for them and when I finally read them to turn out to be female self-inserts. I would prefer if they are more than ten chapters but I would take what I can get.


** ... Where do you keep finding Female self inserts? I don't think I've ever seen one...

*** Google 'harry potter self inserts', open up the first page ffnet community, change the filter to up to date and all ratings. %80 of the page is female self inserts. there are as many mary sue wannabe fangirls who want to romance one of the main cast as there are drops in the ocean. I'm seriously sick of it.

*** A Matter Of Force, somewhat. A male insert in a female body.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3252882/1/A-matter-of-force]])

Funny fic. A lot of xover. Very over the top, not to the taste of everyone, I think.

*** Two of the better SIs I've seen are female. One is called scourgify or something similar and has the insert be crabbes sister, and the other has it be dracos sister, I forget the name of it though. But yeah of the ones I've seen it seems about an even split. But I've only looked at ones recommend here, not just randomly searched for them. I've also read a lot more Naruto SIs and those are probably 75%+ female.

***** Yeah it seems more popular in that fandom for some reason. I guess since the two you mentioned were so popular that a lot of other authors decided to do one.

** linkffn(A Curse of Truth by butalearner) has a male self insert and its complete. I can't vouch for the whole thing since I'm reading it right now. I'm about 7 chapters in and still reading so it must be alright.

*** Well I'm on chapter 10 and I think I spoke too soon. It just took a turn for the ridiculous as far as character emotions go.

Harry: "I was so desperate to make you [Hermione] happy that I even tried to get you to like Ron."

Everyone get on the bizarre train. Choo choo, next stop, finding a new fic to read...

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

*** A guy or a gal who was taken from our world to a world they know as fiction. Usually by ROBs(random omnipotent beings), reincarnation or falling through the cracks between universes. They usually start mucking up the plot as soon as they find out where they are and think they know better for some misguided reason.Sometimes they try to romance with one of the main cast.

**** Oh. Those fics where the author feels the need to write about themself being Harry's best friend because their real life sucks XD

Never liked them. They always seem to go the same way, author is a bamf and they know everything in the story so they are sooooooo useful when the rest of the cast is useless.

***** I feel like these stories can be good... They just usually aren't because they come from a place of wish fulfillment. A good version would have to have a healthy dose of self depreciating humor and a desire to make fun of themselves that a lot of people don't seem interesting in doing.
