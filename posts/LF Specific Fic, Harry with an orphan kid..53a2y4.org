Hey guys, I have a random scene from a fic stuck in my head, and absolutely no idea what doc it's from. I can't even remember if the fic was any good or not to be honest. Anyways, what I remember is that it's a Harry centric fic, set in his later school years (6th year maybe?). Harry is at the Dursley's for the summer and he's volunteering at this orphanage, and has a close friendship with this little boy who's a wizard (but too young for Hogwarts). I remember that he plans on adopting the kid once he's of age, and he tells Hermione about the kid in case something happens to him. And I think at some point, the Dark Lord finds the kid and holds him hostage? That's all I can remember. Thanks in advance!


** Gah, I know this fic! I've read this. A MM pairing but I don't remember which, and I think it might be an unfinished one, because I can't recall the ending but I remember a hostage of the kid, and that he was like a 3 year old kid who had magical abilities at an orphanage he volunteered at.

Sorry, I can't recall the information. I'll think about it, and pop back if I can.

As for quality all I can remember is that it had some heavy cheesy moments. No idea where it ended up on quality though.
