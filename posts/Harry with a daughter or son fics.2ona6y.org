** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5924318/1/][A Father Divided]]

Harry joins Voldemort as his Apprentice, leaving a pregnant Ginny behind. Eleven years later, James 'Weasley' is on a quest to find out who his father is, who the mystical figure of 'Harry Potter is, and dreaming of one day overthrowing Voldemort's Empire.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9415372/1/][Beltane Child]]

Harry needs some time to let his guard down in the war. So he goes to a celebration just before he, Ron and Hermione plan to get Hufflepuff's Cup from Bellatrix Lestrange's vault. Who could have guessed what the consequences would be?

Not a perfect match for what you want, but its a shock for Harry when he finds out that he's going to be a dad when the girl is nearly due.

I can think of 2 others that fit your description, but neither are on my favourites list. One was a daughter with Gabrielle Delacour, she was already an adult when she found Harry on some island near Alaska. The other was a son with a muggle girl. Teddy befriended the boy in their first year and invites him home (to Harry's) over Christmas break. I believe it was a Harry/Daphne story, but I'm not 100% positive.

*** I've read Beltane child already.

I will be very grateful if you can find the two stories you mention :x I'll try looking too but I think you'd probably have a higher chance of finding it.

THANKS AGAIN!!

Here's the other, sadly it's pretty short and incomplete. My internet was out when I got home, otherwise I would have found it earlier.

** In Tears / Blood of the Phoenix Harry has a daughter. Link's probably somewhere to find in [[/r/hpfanfiction]], I'm on mobile atm.

*Edit:* He knows he has one, though.
