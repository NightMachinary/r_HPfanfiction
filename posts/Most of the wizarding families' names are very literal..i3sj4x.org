The Potters made pots.

The Greengrasses had a good looking lawn.

The Bones family was an accidental result of a necromantic ritual. All the Boneses are just skeletons with disguises.

The Longbottoms had long bottoms.

The Blacks were black.

The Weasleys were really into beasiality with fucking weasels.

The Dumbledores' door had a dumbell as its handle.

***** One such is Nothing to Lose by Writing Warriors linkffn(8662532)

It's based off the premise that, when Remus Lupin (while "guarding" Harry at Privet Drive) refuses to answer Harry's questions about Ron and Hermione, Harry gets it into his head that they are both dead. So he goes full berserker on the Death Eaters. Mr. Greengrass is not a DE, but as an "importer" he does sell questionable items to DEs and suspected DEs.

#+begin_quote
  This story, as a few are in the world of Harry Potter fanfiction, stems from one of those many ideas of Rorschachs Blot, entitled "Nothing to Lose." One of the areas this story will explore is the possible impact on Harry Potter and friends of the isolation that our dear old friend, Albus Dumbledore, always fed to him: this isolation will make up its own reality.

**** Part of this is a British thing. They tend to call each other by last name, especially in school. First names are for friends (and even then it's more likely to have a nickname), not acquaintances and certainly not for people you've just met.

Americans are very rude by UK/European standards because of our insistence on calling everybody by their first names without specific permission. (And for so many other reasons, but this is the one we're talking about.)

In fact, throughout the 7 books, the word Rubeus appears a handful of times. Tom Riddle, during the flashback in book 2, and Ollivander in book 1 are the only one who call him Rubeus while talking to him. The only other times Rubeus appears is when Hagrid is being introduced or mentioned in news.

****** True, Dumbledore has known Hagrid for a very long time, presumably from when he was 11. It might be that he started as a student and then was an employee and subordinate in the Order --- none of them strictly a "friend" relationship. Or it could be something as simple as calling him by his preferred name.

Or, if we're in a bashing mood, it could be that he doesn't really consider Hagrid a colleague worthy of first-name basis. Hagrid doesn't call him Albus either (unless calling him by his full name Albus Dumbledore)... out of respect, or because he was never invited? (Or, you know, because he's usually talking to students who don't have that privilege.)

** as for the history of the Longbottoms, i think my favorite one had Neville showing Harry around his home, including an outfit in a display case and talking wistfully of stories of his grandfather's of "putting on the Cardie and ringing the Doom Bell to let the Devil know he's about to have company" or something to that effect, heh. pretty sure it was a Marvel crossover.

** I should note that Naming Seers are a thing in Harry Potter.

But I'm too busy thinking about the Parkinsons always letting their kids drive them everywhere and the Patils rubbing the heads of the sick to cure them. Or how the Finnegans always have two fish at each meal. The Abbotts actually own an abbey. Lockharts used to specialize in capturing game and stocking private hunting grounds. The Bagshots are notorious for cursing groceries out of people's hands. Blaise spends his off hours adding to his family's Beanie Baby collection. Lavender has plans to attend a prominent Rhode Island college after Hogwarts. Justin dreams of being a bowyer but his nervous twitch makes it impossible. Ernie's family owns and operates a factory that makes Apple computers. Millicent walks like a bull - hey, that one's probably canon. Tracey is [[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vis][stronger during the day.]] Lee is a Born Again Christian. And, of course, Oliver is slinging more than a broom between his legs.

** Oh boy this is very interesting. If anyone centered a fanfic around this, I would gladly read it.

I remember reading a fanfic once where Harry doesn't like his last name and asked what his parents did. When he found out that they weren't potters, he wanted to change his last name to something other than Potter and more accustomed to his status. This discussion made me recall that fanfic. Forgot the name of the fanfic tho
