  At first she didn't quite believe her eyes. Severus Snape here, on her doorstep, was so far outside the realm of anything she'd ever believed possible that she couldn't fully comprehend what she was seeing for a few seconds.

#+begin_quote
  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

  ((originally posted elsewhere as "Bride of the Potions Professor")) Sometimes all it takes to change the world is one small, simple choice. On the night the Death Eaters attack Hogwarts, Hermione Granger makes such a choice. Her life---and her world---will never be the same.The guilt from killing Draco is bad enough, and knowing she saved Dumbledore doesn't help it, but when a Ministry decree forces her to marry Professor Snape---a cruel, cold man who's apparently hated her since she was a child---in order to be used as a breeder of superior wizards, Hermione doesn't think her life can get any worse. But, of course, she's wrong.Soon, Voldemort's after her and her friends (again), her life is in grave peril, and all her hopes for a future at all, much less a happy one, rest on her own shoulders---and on Snape, her unwanted husband, whose heart still belongs to a woman long dead.

  This started out as a crack-fic idea. Then I started writing it, and it decided it wanted to be much more than crackfic---and much, much longer as well! The thank you list for this one is equally massive: first, to everyone at the severusharrybb community---thank you for the cheering, the pep-talks and the glimpses at all your WIPs; you kept me going when frustration with JKR's plotholes and fear of deadlines made it tough to keep going. To the mods for putting such hard work into organising this big bang, with extra special thanks to accioslash for much needed honesty when I was angsting over the ending of this which prompted the brainwave I needed. To my britpicker rycolfan for her reassurance, badgerlady for whipping my typos and M-dashes into shape, and abrae for a fantastic and thorough beta (the semicolon is dead; long live the semicolon!) and her immeasurably kind words. ♥ And last, but not least, to my artist---I hope you've had as much of a blast illustrating this as I have had writing it!A/N 2: Any scenes/dialogue quoted and adapted from the books are JKR's property and used purely for transformative purposes; I lay no claim to them and make no money off them whatsoever.
