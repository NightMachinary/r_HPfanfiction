I don't really mind what he does in the story as long as it isn't something regular like an auror or curse-breaker. I want stories where he becomes a dark Lord or travels the world looking for esoteric magics. Please no harry/Ginny or Hermione or Luna and No Slash


** Harry striving for and achieving greatness, eh? I got just the fic for that.

  Her whole life has been about gaining power through struggle and sacrifice and manipulation of the only thing she has going for her (Charlotte's a terrible person beneath the pretty face and she knows it). Charlotte wants to be more than the girl from the cupboard and she's not above using others to gain power.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
