Family and blood ties are central to Harry's protection, well why not move that thinking a bit earlier in canon. Lily decides bunking with her ‘normal' sister in her ‘normal' neighbor will be better. Choosing a different secret keeper could also make things interesting too. :)


** Incomplete, but an interesting take on the idea. (The Potters don't show up until the third part of the chapter.)

  On the eleventh birthday you will receive wands and wonderment and made-up words; a tabby cat and a test and three presents for people who do not exist; knowledge and names and another one, who is like you.

** Hmm, does a Secret Keeper have to be magical?

*** It's never stated as far as I know. I've always assumed the Potters cast the spell on the secret keeper.

**** The fidelius is an interesting spell.

It has four components that we know of,

- The secret

- The secret's description/location

- The caster

- The secret-keeper

I believe the reason that Albus couldn't be the keeper was because he was the caster, so those can't be the same, though "The Secret" may just be that.

It appears to be a location/object hiding spell, and the secret-keeper can't be inside the secret for long.

When the keeper dies, it effectively collapses.

The caster is automatically "in" to the secret.

It also hides the secret in the keepers soul, making it an inexorable part of them - so the question is this: Do muggles have a soul?
