I'm looking for Harry to be so unstable after the war that he has to take the memories out and into a pensive (which later is brought up showing how unhealthy that is) and in turn he becomes less caring and less emotional. He actually becomes more social able but there are drawbacks. One sceneario I thought of is him being a womanizer because he is able to not connect with people if he stores away the memories. He'll keep the good ones of him and his friends so he remains normal with them. I am also thinking maybe Ginny and him got back together after the war but then, idk, she was training with the H Harpies and cheated on him. He said it was okay, they break up and he just takes out all the memories. Something like this exist? Would anyone be interested in reading something like this? Thanks!


** It's an interesting idea, though I'm not sure I understand what you mean by "take the memories out". Does this mean he literally removes any tramautic memories? If so, I don't think it'd make him emotionally unavailable, he'd just have strange gaps in his memory.

Though you could write an interesting one-shot with it starting with him missing those memories, going looking for them, finding out he removed them himself and left a note telling himself not to look at them. He, of course, looks at them, and spirals into a deep depression. End it with him removing the memories again and writing another note, all while knowing that it's cyclical and he'll just end up investigating the missing memories again later, and you've got a compelling, if sad, story.

*** Fixed* meant to say has to take the memories out and for possible use in a pensive.

I'm thinking, in some twisted logic, any new people in his life that make him have feelings of care, he takes out the memories that make him have strong emotions so he doesn't form new bonds for his enemies to exploit. I read a story where Harry's drinks to forget and feel numb. I was thinking of replacing drinking with taking out memories to file away.

Thanks for the one-shot idea!
