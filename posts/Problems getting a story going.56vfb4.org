For the last few weeks I've been wanting to start a new crossover story, but after I write down the first chapter of any new idea, it just seems to fall apart, even though it's (I think, anyway) a solid idea. What do you guys do to combat that?


** Is the idea big enough to sustain an entire story? Maybe sketch out the plot for the first few chapters, or get a beta who's excited about your ideas.

Rorschach's Blot just writes a first chapter of their ideas and moves on in linkffn(Odd Ideas by Rorschach's blot), you're not the only one!

*** See, I think the story premise is definitely enough for at least 40k words, but the wall of that first chapter is shutting the rest of it down. It's like I've set the story up... And then I'm not sure how to take it forward.

**** Can you skip the first few scenes and just start writing? Or write a crappy first chapter knowing that you'll edit it after the story's done? A lot of folks finish their story and edit the entire thing before posting it, you don't have to post chapter by chapter.

** Sometimes, your first chapter (or chapters) are just going to be shit. Just pound it out and move on. You can always fix it later.

But if the problem is deeper than that, you could try outlining. It's a good way to see where the story could go -- and it's a lot smaller investment of time too. Hitting a dead end in an outline is small stuff compared to hitting one in the story proper.

** Try writing out of order. Jump right into that awesome scene you had in mind. You can always come back and write the first chapter later (or just skip it altogether).

** What I do?

Quit.

I work on something else for a while. If I think of any ideas for my story, I write it down. I don't stop until my ideas alone are enough to be a story.
