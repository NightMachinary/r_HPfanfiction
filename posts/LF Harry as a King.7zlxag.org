Are there any fics where Harry is a king of some sort? King of the wizarding world would be pretty cool, though that had never been done before. Crossovers work, as well. I already read Emperor, so that was cool.


** linkffn(Rise of the Wizards) has Harry in the later parts of the fic become King of Britain and conquer the other parts of the world in his path to become Emperor

** King Who Lived was a great fic when I last read it, but I don't really know if it holds up. The premise is, Harry is a neglected child, who goes through a yearly ritual that looks for the ruler of magical britain. Harry is discovered to be the "King of Magic", and the story goes on from there.
