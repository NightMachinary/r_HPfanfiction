I'm tired of only seeing OP harry with no one competent to keep up with him. Are there any fics where the whole of golden trio are OP. Like they're still friends and the whole schools wary of them. They all got their own scary reputation by themselves, but together they're a whole different story.

Or fics where they're powerful in their own right but they have their own roles. Like harry's good with a specific set of magic while ron is good at another and hermione as well.

no harmony


** Off the top of my head,

- [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][/Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived/ by Diane Castle]]: Nonmagical AU: "Harworts" is a school for superspies, Harry is the next James Bond, Ron is nobility and the social skills of the group, and Hermione is a genius hacker and gadgeteer.
- Generally, [[/u/Starfox5]]'s fics tend to feature an ensemble cast led by the BAMF!Trio.

**** linkffn(Harry Potter and the girl who walked on water)

I haven't read it, but it's a Harry/Ron/Hermione fic So I think it's probably focused on them

linkffn(Reformed, Returned and really trying)

This one is crack-ish, it has canon parings and is Harry and Grindelwald centric

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

**** Generally, I think his later stuff (starting with linkffn(Patron by Starfox5)) is better than his earlier stuff. That one is also one of the more Harry-centric ones, though all have ensemble casts.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

**** It's narrated from her point of view (3rd-person limited, IIRC), but I'd say that it has an ensemble cast with a number of well-developed characters, including a number outside the trio.
