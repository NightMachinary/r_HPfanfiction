Additional points if he confronts Snape and urges him to get a move on with Lily before it is too late

And if Lily eventually falls in love with James but has to make it VERY clear she and Snape are nothing.


** I don't like it. The first guy to come along and "like" a girl doesn't get dibs. It's who she likes back. If you mean James thinks they're dating, that's one thing, but deciding Lily "belongs" to someone just because they have a crush on her is ick.

*** There's a lot of ick in fic. I'm sure that some characters believe they can call dibs on people, just like some real people believe this. In one of my fics, James calls dibs on Lily, which means Remus can't date her no matter how much Lily yells at him that the whole concept of calling dibs on girls is sexist.

*** More of a private thought of James by staying clear of Lily.

Your proposal also works, go ahead and write in here if you feel creative.
