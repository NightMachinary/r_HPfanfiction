Now to begin with, I'm talking about the Fics I've read.

Nearly every fic that had a confident Neville, generally is because he gets a new wand, usually at edge-lord Lord Hadrian Black blah blah Potter's advice.

Now to all fanfic writers that enjoy writing a "confident Neville". Stop using the wand as a plot point.

The wand had nothing to do with Neville finding his footing. Neville's improvement can be traced to OoTP, where he actually put in dedicated efforts towards a goal.

He practiced regularly and with the support of Harry and some others who volunteered to partner him, he got better.

By writing off his confidence issues due to a badly matched wand, you're actually putting down the character you're trying to up lift. It's lazy writing.

The boy managed to do his owls and fight off death eaters with the same wand.

By writing him off to be better because of a wand, you're basically saying that it's the weapon that makes the man and not the man who makes the weapon.

So yeah, please stop doing the magic wand = confidence thing.

Loads of people use less than well matched wands. They aren't squibs who lack confidence.

Do your characters and yourself a favour. Work on developing the character. You're all good writers, you can do this.

Idk if this is what JKR was going for, but I've always seen DH Neville as 'Harry-lite.' Inspired, in large part, by Neville telling the trio he stood up to the Carrows because he noticed it gave people hope when Harry stood up to people.

Regardless, though, Harry's importance to Neville's development is pretty underrated and why I think Neville would ultimately fail if their roles were reversed. Harry, admittedly, doesn't think much of him until the end of OotP, but it's clear he inspired Neville starting with "I'm worth twelve of you, Malfoy."

*** I'll add an extra point here on top of Harry being an inspiration and a rather good teacher to Neville. His Gran. It's not the wand or even Harry who is responsible for his change in confidence, though that provides the impetus, but Augusta's change in attitude towards Neville from DoM onwards. I believe that is the single most important factor here, especially since it's her opinion that matters most to him. It gives Neville pride in himself that rounds out with her letter in DH.

Everyone writes him off saying better wand, better Neville. They completely ignore that his parents were tortured, he wanted revenge, the pain and rage he felt within him.

They completely disregard the fact that after the breakout, he was singularly focused on improving and being able to fight and working hard towards it

They write all of that off by saying "got a wand, he can do magic now, he'll be great. " Which is horrible character depth because there isn't any dimension to the character if you do that.

**** To be fair, Neville is one of the lesser issues when it comes to lacking character dimensions. Fanfiction often revolves around bashing of some sort or the whole hero vs evil thing, and to an extent all are fine. The problem is they are often overdone to caricaturize certain characters into their biggest flaws or benefits. Dumbledore, Ron, and Snape are 3 clear examples of it. All receive significant bashing and then there is the "Snape is the nicest, best guy ever" section which is equally bad. Rowling, for all her plot holes, did a good job of reflecting different dimensions of characters.

When I write, if I dislike a character, I will simply tend to minimize their role to avoid bashing but also avoid using them as central points.

That being said, it is ultimately up to the author to choose. If they want to bash or attribute Neville's wand as the sole confidence issue, they can. We can use this area to provide suggestions, but not complain, as it is their work.

***** To be fair, I said that in most instances, he get's a wand - his personality changes overnight. It's a trend that is extremely rampant.

One that is influencing younger and newer fanfic writers. The other day, a person I beta for, did this in their story. When I asked why, they said they wanted a confident Neville. I didn't care about that, their story. I asked them, why was the wand change that important and they honestly believed the wand was why Neville changed.

I've seen this trend happen with fanfic writers. After a point you forget certain canon details, and that's fine. It happens. Many can't even read canon again.

But when people start believing in fanon, and it affects their writing in a style that is detrimental to them, it is bad.

If you believe Neville's wand is the sole reason, go for it. But most often, whenever people go down that route, his character development is shot to bits because people don't care about it anymore, they don't focus on it or build it up. It's just a switch. Which from a writer's perspective, is very bad. Not only does it kill your word count. You lose interest, conflict, subplots and emotional connect from the reader.

You need character development.

This post is a suggestion. Not a complaint.

** Well everyone can write their characters however you want and every reader is free to choose what they want to read.

Now in all seriousness, we all had that classmate who was a bit slow but was otherwise a functional human being. That's Neville for you. I agree that in DH he is forced to take charge and before that he is struggling to keep up/catch up, but since it doesn't go against what JK said, I believe that everything with regards to the situation presented by you is fair game.

Oh, and the theory with the wand was pretty popular both in Ron's and Neville's case and it's based on the fact that Harry didn't feel comfortable using a wand that he had for like a month (not for years like the two). Neville was just slow and grew up as a character and Ron was fucked over by the movies. The explanation is as simple as that.

My biggest issue with fanon Neville is this lack of nuance. Neville grew into a confident teenager able to stand up to scary people, but he didn't become this skilled wizard fan fiction makes him out to be. Because for all the confidence he gained in the middle of OotP he still scored an acceptable in Transfiguration.

Book Neville just found himself in a situation to take over from Harry because everyone else that mattered was gone. I know that nowadays Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness is hated because of the author but, despite of all his flaws, he did a pretty good job portraying the fact that the only reason Neville ended up as the leader of DA was because people viewed him as close to Harry and Ginny was forced into hiding, while Luna was captured and the trio was on the run.

Yeah I agree. That's what the entire post is about. I'm trying to state that the character development of Neville in the books isn't because he changed his wand.

I don't personally like Neville as a character. However to reduce the development and growth of Neville to a change in an instrument that he uses, is just ruining the character and your own writing.

It wouldn't make sense unless you're writing something like "The Mask". Humans don't develop confidence because of something they use.

Neville became better through effort. He became more confident as a person through trials, time and ultimately growth. The wand wasn't that important.

Don't stop using that as a plot point, if you enjoy it. It's your story, don't let a random redditor tell you otherwise, because their headcanon is different.

While Neville in canon started to get more confident before getting a new wand, afterwards he leads a freakin' rebellion.

Additionally, if you constantly fail at something because you have bad tools, you do become less confident. Yes, you should not blame tooling for every little issue you have, but imagine trying to learn to play the piano when it's untuned. Nothing you ever do will sound good, so what's the point?

His development was fine. There's no canon correlation between the number of incidents of accidental magic and the potency of the wizard's magic. His failings with magic come from having a bad tool.

***** The thing is, there seems to be no reference in canon outside of Ollivander's advertising spiel that wand 'matching' is in any way a big deal. Ron cheerfully states on the train in the Philosopher's Stone that he is disappointed in his wand because it is falling apart (the unicorn hair is literally poking out), not that it wasn't 'chosen for him'. He says that Charlie used it in Hogwarts before him, suggesting that for the Weasleys, and probably many others, using hand-me-down wands at school is normal without any problems. Ron's wand is literally broken for the entire of second year, but none of the teachers care and outside of a couple of specific incidents, doesn't seem to impact his work at all. I presume Crouch Jnr. spent the entirety of book 4 using Moody's wand. Voldemort was using Lucius' wand in book 7 and killed Moody with it, probably by far the most dangerous of all of his enemies.

The entire 'wand loyalty' mess in book seven also implies that all the stress fanfic puts on matching wand materials to its owners is utterly irrelevant, as long as the wand is 'yours' it will work for you.

Fanfiction writers are free to make wand matching important in their stories, as long as they don't make it just apply to Harry and Neville, but that isn't what happens in canon.

Perform better in his OWLs? Now it's rather speculative. There's two portions in an OWL, written and practical, and there's nothing to suggest that he was particularly great with the theory either for him to get a better grade.

Your parallel inapplicable. With respect to origami paper/cardboard and potatoes, those are the sources which generate the end result. A wand is a focii or medium.

Yes using a proper focii would always be better. But my argument isn't that.

My argument is that the source i.e. Neville is great by himself and writing his success down to his focii discredits him greatly. The guy had one of the best arcs through the story. If you really believe that all he needed was a wand to develop as a character - you're gutting the character and hampering his development, which effects the quality of your writing, which is the point I'm trying to make.

***** I mean, Neville casts a total of about three spells on screen in the ministry. His casting doesn't seem different from the others'. Like for sure he'll get a better performance with a wand that actually chose him, but he learns and casts the spells that Harry teaches the DA with his old wand.

But even so, his confidence isn't solely based in his magical abilities? It's about bravery, doing what's right, being part of a group. It's about carving out his own identity and sense of self.

** I understand where you are coming from but I disagree. Our experiences make us who we are. Neville's experiences as far as I can tell are of what seems to be a seemingly magically weak, unpopular boy, who is constantly being made to feel like he isn't good enough while at home. So you take the fanon Neville trope and you have a boy who usually in first year is accepted and befriended by (according to the wizarding world at large) the most popular influential wizard who thanks to said wizard doesn't ever grow to think he is even magically weak because a properly matched wand shows that he is more than powerfully magically. If confidence is the major point in Neville's development in canon, in the common fanon he has that going for him in spades. And it all starts as soon as he is befriended by The Harry Potter. He now has the confidence to disclose their status as god brothers and recognizes his worth to Harry by being much more knowledgeable about wizarding society. It also should be noted that in a whole healing lot of these fics Neville is placed on a near equal level with Harry as far as power goes and more than a fair few wind up as (or near) Super Harry fics.

I get where you are coming from but yeah...

*** Wow that's a paragraph ._.

Ok, confident Neville, is just the term people use to refer to him in my experience. Neville who is bad ass etc etc. I'm not really focusing on the confidence part.

Regarding confidence and his development. I might have made a slight mistake through the course of my post. I used the term confidence in a lot of places where I should have used growth or development because that's what I meant. My bad if it caused confusion.

So what I'm trying to state is, the development of Neville in those Fics, in my experience, is often keyed to his wand. It's - get the right wand = become Harry's right hand man who is super confident and powerful in those Fics. They downplay the other factors, if they exist, and push the wand of Neville to be the key factor behind his development. Which I feel affects the quality of the writing, because you're essentially robbing the character of growth.

**** Lol It was poorly written. My apologies. I was basically saying that (from what I have observed) the trope is a little different. The trope as I see it is mainly: Become friends with Harry who then insures that Neville gets a properly fitted wand, this leads to Neville never lacking much confidence in the first place. Without that lack of confidence in his magic/ability and his friendship with Harry, Neville develops (or already has) the confidence to show his power from nearly the beginning. And I was basically saying that from what I have read (for the most part) it is Neville's friendship with Harry that makes him super confident. I totally agree that this is used to explain away all of his other issues though. Although to be fair being best friends with the most popular person in the wizarding world who accepts and values you would be a huge ego boost. And because in most of these fics since Neville replaces Ron, there is no impetus for Harry to slack off all the time. So they both live up to their potential from the beginning. It also tends to go along with the trope that Neville is the gateway for Harry to the wider wizarding world (learning about his inheritance and titles).

*** Misunderstanding here.

Not talking about specific Fics, but a common trope.

In these Fics, Harry always plays a key role. Usually the trope is Harry is a guy who learns politics and wizarding culture from books, is super dedicated to beating Voldemort, is grey, inherits a lot of things etc.

He finds out Neville, who is usually a replacement for Ron in these Fics, is using his dad's wand. May or may not have a rant on how that's bad. Gets him a new wand. Neville, gets confidence and starts becoming a prodigy in magic, second to Harry though, and voila. May or may not feature forays into wandless magic.

Can't really name the Fics. Generally these are the ones you close and put out of sight and out of mind. But it's pretty common as a trope. You'll find it littered in abundance in Fics where Neville plays the best friend, Harry inherits more than one vault, or grey Harry fics.

It's prevalent in a more subtle manner as well. You'll find Harry watching them practice in the RoR, (may or may not be related to the DA and Fifth year), and observing to himself "Ever since Neville received a new wand that matched him perfectly he had become a new person" or "changed overnight" or along those lines.

I don't keep track of Fics that leave a bad taste so I can't help you out with bad ones. However if you want recommendations of where I believe Neville was developed in a better manner, I can help there.

**** Sure. I'm always open to new fic recommendations =)

Two that come to mind that were building confidence first were harry potter and the methods of rationality (I don't remember neville even getting a new wand there) and nightmares of future past, in which he did get a wand but he was already doing much better before that. Those also happen to be 2 of my favorite fics along with the psychic serpent trilogy. But yeah, I just haven't encountered that specific scenario when the trope is present so was wondering. You are right those are probably not worth reading.

***** Family Bonds by xXDesertRoseXx. It's a WBWL, Harry raised by Snape fic.

It was one of the first I read, so I remember it fondly but it's been a while since I've read it.

It's incomplete unfortunately, but it was nice to read.

I think I recall a few more but my memory is a bit murky. I'm not sure how Harry Crow or Partners went so I can't recommend those in good faith. Off the top of my head though, these are the three that come to mind. I'd recommend sticking to Family Bonds though because Neville in that story is pretty cool.

** Not sure why someone couldn't do both? His insecurity seems to come from the fact that he was thought to be squib (which is why his uncle or someone throws him out the window), and the fact that he's rather bad at magic (which should be at least in part caused by the fact that the wand he's using is not his).

We can assume that if he had a wand that did choose him, he would get slightly better results right off the bat, which should slowly build up his confidence.

I can agree that changing a wand shouldn't turn Neville into some master-magician right off the bat, but there's no reason why it shouldn't help him grow more confident, but-by-bit.

** I agree that Neville's confidence in canon came from finding supportive friends who helped him put in the work to successfully improve his magical abilities. He then survived the fight against Death Eaters where he showed his mettle. This got Augusta Longbottom off his case and she started vocalizing her pride in him.

However, we can't discount the significance of the wand - his father's wand. Neville's grandmother is not over the death of her son and is desperate for Neville to emulate the memory of her deceased son that she stunts Neville's development. The wand and Neville do not complement each other (square peg/round hole) and are symbolic of how Neville was raised. Neville would have likely developed his confidence and magical ability sooner had he been in a more nurturing and accepting environment (where he also got a wand that matched him at age 11).

The downside to my last paragraph is that we don't know if we would have gotten the type of hero Neville became in Deathly Hallows. Would Neville have been as caring, helpful, and open-minded of a person?

** I think it depends in part when he gets the new wand. If his father's is holding him back (which I think is likely) and he gets a new one in say, 2nd or 3rd year, I can see how that would go a long way towards bolstering his self-esteem and we would see a jump in his skills as well. Probably not immediate but it wouldn't take long. Maybe end of term? But the one would feed into the other.

Post 5th year, after the battle at the Ministry, it is more of a better tool but he's already gotten a boost in self-esteem. After all, they held out against how many inner circle Death Eaters. He held his own. I like the concept that with the new wand at this point, he's overpowering his spells because he had to work so hard with the old one. So it helps, but he's already gotten proof that he's got the power/ability.

Edit to note that the mindset does not come overnight. He doesn't get a new wand and wake up the next morning all confident and a BAMF. I can accept him getting there /at a minimum/ after a summer's practice with the new wand. The seeds are there (Gryffindor, courage to stand up to 3 of his fellow students--one of whom definitely outweighs him magically, for example); a new wand will help bring out his confidence, but we're not talking Jack's beanstalk here.

** Not for nothing, but while he definitely gains confidence by training during /Order of the Pheonix/, I also have to point out that a new wand earlier would contribute to him being more confident.

Not all his issues stem from his wand, of course, but at least some of his self confidence issues were reinforced by it. His wand was horribly mismatched, and that made casting much more difficult for him than other students. This probably contributed to reinforcing him internalizing the idea that he was barely better than a squib.

A wand alone wouldn't have made him confident, but it would have been one less thing contributing to his negative self-image.

I mean, some goes from being dressed in rags to a proper outfit, and their self-confidence raises almost instantly. How much of an effect would a properly matched wand make?

** The way I see the new wand as a tool of Neville's development is because with it suddenly things he's been struggling with come easier. To me it makes sense I'm fics that only cover a year or two as a short cut to Nevilles confidence without the build up in cannon, however in stories that come anywhere close to the timeframe of the books yeah it's lazy and doesn't do justice to Neville.

It's not the be-all-end-all but having the right tools should make a difference. If you're constantly underperforming you're most likely not going to feel like you can do something, and you might give up more easily.
