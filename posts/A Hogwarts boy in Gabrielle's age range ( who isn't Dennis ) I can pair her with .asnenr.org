** She was 8 in GoF and 11 in book seven. Harry wasn't at Hogwarts for the seventh year so I don't think we know any of the first years.

*** Oh sorry, I meant to say so in the OP : For the purposes of my story she was 11 during Goblet of Fire.

**** If she is 11, then why does she need a pairing? She's 11 for fucks sake!

****** Same question then, why does she need a pairing??

You obviously don't care who it is, you just need a name to fill out. So it can't matter at all for the plot.

Have you tried not pairing her? She can just be single. Or better yet, let her have "a boyfriend" who Harry (I'm assuming Harry is the MC?) never bothers to learn the name off. Hell, turn it into a running joke where it's a different kid every chapter.
