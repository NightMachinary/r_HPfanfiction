** I recommend you use [[https://scryer.darklordpotter.net/][Scryer]] to search FFN instead. It has many more options to narrow down the stories you want, including the ability to filter out fics that have been tagged as slash. It also allows you to exclude many different pairings from your searches, whereas FFN's search only allows you to exclude one.

** And we wonder why this sub is considered somewhat homophobic.

*** I'm not I just don't particularly want to read that kind of stuff. Just cuz I'm straight automatically means I'm homophobic does it?

**** The subject of your question was fine, but the way your phrased it implied that you think all slash stories are inherently bad. You said that the slash stories prevent you from finding "decent" fics, as if no slash fic could possibly be "decent". It would have been better to replace the word "decent" with the phrase "fics that I can enjoy."

It's ok to express a personal preference. It's not ok to act as if your preference defines the objective quality of all fics.
