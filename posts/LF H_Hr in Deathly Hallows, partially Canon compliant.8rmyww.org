Looking for Fics that contain them develop a deep Relationship. Basically it can be built on the "teasing" moments in the Book, like Hermione reads Lilys letter in Grimmauldplace or her teary face on the Wedding or other moments. So of course they trust each other...but it goes further than that. Of course it is Romance, but i would avoid the "I love you" phrase untill the end of it. (my understanding of it comes with the using in the Canon, so it should be used really rare). Here i would like to read "their actions, gestures and thoughts speaks louder than Words".

I would accept a "different Route" (or AU, if you want to call it so) to gain this goal.

Key elements like the Locket destruction should be the same, as they are important passages (in my eyes). In "Interloper" by Romantic Silence, shows the aftermath of the Destruction from Rons POV and with a different answer from Harry.

I would also accept Movie influences, like the Tent dance. The Point, where they realize that they have (deeper) feelings for each other doesnt actually matter.

[[https://www.deviantart.com/art/Harry-And-Hermione-263472805]] this picture gives a good inspiration about how it could go after it. Many Authors use this, even if their Fics dont contain this pair. And i must say, the effect looks better in a smaller size, because she looks even more sleepier and as if she is inhaling Harrys scent to get calm.

"Deathly Hallows Revisited" by redstarpuppy shows a good way on how to do it, although when i first have read it, the teasing passages were like a "cock block"....if i may say so, but the Kiss was really good (im not sure, if the Author simply put the Riddle kiss into this, but nonetheless im fine with that).

"Meant To Be" by CutieBear53 deals with the movie versions of H/Hr developing feelings after Ron leaves. They even have to face the "consequences" for their doings, after Ron returns and its quite good, but unfortunately unfinished. But it gives a show about how Ron gets confronted, when he witness that H/Hr "cheat" or "betray" him.

as good and dramatic as this is, i would like to have it smooth, maybe one-sided [[/r/Hr][r/Hr]], although im not rejected to this relationship drama.

in chemprofs "Notebook's and Letters" they even sleep together in Bed (no sex, because neither of them is ready yet, but they are in underwear) and later really sleep with each other, because they escaped Death scarce.

I would be open for Fics that already start with this constellation of H/Hr (so a better, non-canon development in Year 6 or something like that) and it goes the way.


** Wow, I nearly thought this was a prompt because it's incredibly specific as a request. I can't think of anything that hits all of this, though I'll give it a look (I feel like I might have read something like this, but it might have been the ones you mentioned).

  specific? i described, what im looking for in the first sentences. The rest (the fics that i posted) are just hints about how it can go. Deep developing Friendship with Romance, but without the 3 famous Words. Just they show how much they care through "their actions, gestures and thoughts" and that i accept a AU like DH if this is necessary to be possible.

**** It's a longer post that most other requests, that's all. I think it's a great request because when I see a request like "LF H/HR no Ron bashing", I think, 'thats searchable in ff.net' and feel a little annoyed that it's too simple.

** I don't think it meets all your criteria to the letter, but in spirit, this one counts. It's one of my favorites. I wish the author would update. linkffn(Harry Potter and the hallows of death)

  War changes everyone: Harry resolves to face destiny and struggles to reconcile with Dumbledore's past, fully aware of the price he must pay for victory. Hermione walks through fire, determined to share in Harry's burden. Ron battles resurgent jealousy and soon discovers he may lose far more than he stood to gain. One thing is certain; peace is never cheaply purchased. H/Hr
