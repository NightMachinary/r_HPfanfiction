  The world keeps spinning right beneath his feet. Except it's as if the world was put back together not quite right, and he can't find his footing. Harry finds that the only one can help him is Hermione, and that's an entirely other problem. [Post-War.] [Head Boy, Head Girl.] [HARMONY.][COMPLETE.]

  When Harry, Ron and Hermione decide to return to Hogwarts after the war to finish their schooling, they are expecting an easy year. Nobody expected McGonagall to push for inter-house unity and nobody expected the unlikely friendships and relationships that would result. Tells the tale of the trios final year at school, then goes beyond that.ORIGINALLY POSTED ON FANFICTION.NET UNDER NAME OF HOLZ9364. However, I am in the process of deleting that account.

** I've got some smut though I'm not sure what you mean by 8th year.

Try everything on Hentai Foundry by Cambrian not all are Harry Potter though.

Try aTasteofDarkness on Fanfic.net again not all of them are Harry Potter.

For romance maybe try Barefoot by Zaxaramas. 153k words HarryxTonks original premise and is just good.

I have a few more but I'm not sure if your okay with harem.

**** Ah. Sorry I should have realized that. I dont have much for that but maybe try Whiskey Time Travel by Sapper One though it's not exactly what your looking for. For smut after Hogwarts try Mutually Satisfactory Arrangements by Cambrian Beckett on Fanfic.net.

  Hermione Granger returns to Hogwarts to help rebuild the shattered castle the summer after the war. She and the other summer resident - and eventually their friends - have to come to terms with how the war broke more than just the walls of the building. Follows multiple Hogwarts students through '8th year' and one additional year of early adulthood. COMPLETE.
