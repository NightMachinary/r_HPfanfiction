When I am reading fanfiction, Harry always seem to never to anything wrong to his friends while Hermione and more often then not Ron do it.

Is Harry the perfect friend in canon?


** Honestly, yes and no. The way I see it, Harry is kind of like Fred from Scooby Doo.

He drags his friends into dangerous situations that they repeatedly warn him /are bad ideas/. Harry constantly wants to solve whatever "mystery" the group comes across, even though Hermione and Ron are reluctant to jump into them or arrive at tenuous conclusions.

AND YET they still follow him into dangerous situations and help to solve murder/disguise/etc. mysteries, knowing how stupid it is for a bunch of teenagers to be jumping into this.

Actually, this metaphor works a lot better than I thought. Hermione is Velma+Daphne (smart, but apparently somewhat pretty) and Ron is Shaggy+Scooby (scared sometimes, has a thing about food, worried about doing dangerous stuff).

Edit: WOW. Apparently, people liked this. That must mean its either 1) More correct than I had thought, 2) Funnier than I thought, or 3) There are A LOT more Scooby Doo fans than I originally thought.

**** It works even better than I said too.

Harry is the jock leader who charges in head first (Fred). He rides around on a broom and decides where they go (Fred's Mystery Van anybody?).

Hermione is both the smart one and the pretty one (Velma and Daphne). She is also the one that usually gets attacked/taken/injured first (petrified in CoS, hit by the tooth curse in GoF, taken by Bellatrix for interrogation over the others and tortured). She is even sort of the cheerleader for Harry and Ron, though that varies depending on the book (7th in particular).

Ron actually fits more only if you use the movie portrayal of him (he is more scared and food is made bigger for him than in the books) (Shaggy and Scooby). He cracks jokes fairly often, he is very "superstitious" and probably the most easily frightened, and he does love his food (though thankfully not dogfood). And like Shaggy and Scooby, Ron still follows his friends into these incredibly foolish situations, usually just because they are his friends (with the possible exception of CoS).

Now that I think about it, I can just imagine a crack fic (4th year summer for instance) where these three are out solving mysteries and chasing down villains. Some ideas:

*Harry: Well gang, looks like we've got another mystery on our hands.*

*Ron: I can already taste those chocolate covered potatoes.*

*Hermione: There is a very logical explanation for all of this.*

I need to write this down now before I forget.

** Writing believable fuck ups is difficult, especially on a personal level. At least half of the interpersonal train wrecks I witnessed were totally avoidable if people actually considered the other point of view and/or were more considerate. If you write such a situation in fiction, it will often come across as unnecessary drama since the reader immediately knows what went wrong and fault the protagonist for being too stupid to notice.

Also, getting fucked over is something most of us can relate to. It is a lot harder to admit that you are the one at fault for something. No one likes admitting mistakes. No one likes to be reminded of that, so we don't want a beloved character, in which we are invested into to some degree, to be in the wrong.

As for that ship, well, I think even JKR came around to it a few years ago.

*** This is why I said yes and no in my post.

He is very dedicated to people he has made friends with, and willingly does everything he can to help or save their lives.

On the other hand, he is fairly focused on /his own/ problems. As bad as Ron's issues are, its always this incredible shock to him whenever Hermione has to explain that Ron is jealous or afraid. Ditto for Hermione, he really seems unconcerned about how Hermione is getting to classes in 3rd year. Part of this is he is a teenage boy, which means he isn't playing with a full deck.

But as a practical matter, most of the danger they are in comes directly or indirectly from being assosciated with Harry. They would probably still be in danger (Ron's family are "blood-traitors" and loyal to Dumbledore, Hermione is muggle-born and something of a moralist crusader), but they would not be targets #2 and #3 if not associated with him.

Harry probably still would have gone into the Chamber for Ginny if he was not Ron's friend: Hogwarts is home and he doesn't really know any other schools are a thing. Harry still would have tried to save Buckbeak and Sirius if given the opportunity (though without a time-turner he would have been sol).

Part of the story seems to imply that Harry could not have triumphed if he wasn't friends with Ron and Hermione. My take is that this is the power Voldemort knows not: friendship. He cannot understand friends, he never had or wanted them. He only calls people that to gain allegiance.

It's like when people say "Hey, he didn't make the split with Ron better in GoF, he was partly to fault". My initial thought is always that one of them was about to be put in mortal peril (again) while the other reacted out of jealousy. Bit different, that.

********* Because as most other commenters did, the question of being perfect has an obvious answer (the being "no", since no one is a perfect friend), so most responded to whether or not he was a good friend. Which I think he is, though canon doesn't focus on showing that.

********** And did I ever say he wasn't a good friend? On the contrary. I said Hermione and Ron were good friends, too.

** In OOTP, pretty much the first thing he does when he sees them for the first time all summer is vent all of his anger and yell at them for 10 minutes for something they had no control over. Like, Harry's a real dick about it too. Pretty sure Hermione starts to cry, actually.

He also gets somewhat jealous when Ron gets the Prefect position instead of him.

And that fight in 4th year over the Triwizard Tournament with Ron? Harry was just as stubborn as Ron. He didn't try to go over and talk things out. He just took Hermione's word that "he's /jealous/" and said "well, then fuck you, too, Ron."

He also was a jerk to Hermione in 3rd year over the whole Firebolt debacle and sided with Ron on the issue.

Also, Ron and Hermione's issues tended to stay in the background of Harry's mind. He noticed some odd behavior now and again, like with Hermione's Time Turner shenanigans and Ron's insecurites, but he never really confronts them about it, and they never really bring it up because Harry's got enough to worry about what with being in mortal peril every year.

So no, he wasn't always the perfect friend, and not a lot of fanfics address that.

*** I think he OoTP example isn't much. He did, after all, walk someone he respected into an ambush murder, followed by being tortured and witness the resurrection of magic Hitler-Einstein and his wannabe SS members. Following that up with a summer of isolation is the worst choice possible, most people would have reacted that way, worse even.

The GoF example is even lesser. Harry was facing mortal danger, Ron was just jealous at the "attention". Nearly all of Ron's issues (to the extent that they are even mentioned before DH) are fairly trivial by comparison. So it becomes less interesting (hence why JKR didn't show it much) to focus on the day to day issues vs Character X has this lethal danger staring him in the face.

There are much better examples, like the Firebolt example you mentioned. At least there it's not really explainable as resulting more from pressure that would cow most into extreme anxiety.

**** Oh, I'm not saying that Harry didn't have a right to be angry in OOTP. I'm just saying that taking it out on his best friends, and /blaming/ them for some parts just isn't fair to Ron or Hermione. It's understandable why he's in the mood for yelling, but still unfair.

As for Ron's issues, I'd assume Ron thought they were pretty trivial too, which is why he never brought it up with Harry. So, he bottles it up inside for seven years until he was faced with a Horcrux spilling out his deepest darkest insecurities.

Ron believed he had little to no self-worth. It's not that he wanted attention. It's that he felt he wasn't wanted or needed and didn't bring anything to the table. He was constantly comparing himself to his brothers and sister and his best friend, and he saw all the things they accomplished and couldn't see himself be an equal , most certainly not be an equal for the most brilliant witch he's ever met.

Just because Ron's issues /seem/ trivial compared to the problems Harry had to deal with, it does not make them unimportant.

I'm not going to go into the meta of it. JK Rowling wrote what she did, and that's that. Just saying that from an in-story perspective canon-Harry really had some "bad friend" moments.

***** I agreed that he had some bad friend moments, but 2 of the examples you gave weren't legitimate ones in my view (the Firebolt one was legit though). Sure, it's unfair but most people would have done worse, probably sooner. I had even forgotten this was after he nearly lost his soul.

Hermione states that Ron is just jealous in GoF. It's definitely understandable (I've an older sister working on her PhD and seemed like she could do anything most days, no stranger to self-worth issues), but basically ditching a friend over it, who might die and clearly didn't want it, is beyond the pail. It wasn't restricted to DH (which funnily enough was probably a more understandable reaction given the Horcrux).

*** Agree. They all had their faults as friends. However, I think Harry's are largely ignored in fanfiction.

** I would turn the argument around:

Are they good friends to him?

I mean seriously:

They obey Dumbledore when Harry is drowning in survivor's guilt (he could have killed himself, it has happened! That's why people receive councelling normally!) not once, but TWICE! Damned, do you guys have no compassion (they even get offended when Harry calls them out! Seriously, I would have probably told the Headmaster where to stick it and I wouldn't have come to Grimmauld-Place if he doesn't let me contact my friend! - "If you do this headmaster, then I will stay at my parents' place and if you intercept my mail I'll inform the DMLE!")

They don't seem to see that Harry is abused (bars on the windows? A cat-flap to feed him? Tons of locks on the door? Underfed and small for his age? etc. etc. - Damned, are you people BLIND?)

Hermione sees nothing wrong in going behind Harry's back (Firebolt incident!) - no, good intentions don't make this ok!

Hermione doesn't know boundaries ("I have to know all your secrets Harry, I deserve that knowledge!") while she doesn't talk a lot about herself (we don't know much about her pre-Hogwarts years for example or about her parents!)

Ron is a jealous little prick that abandons Harry twice - once because he's jealous and once because he's freaking hungry (no: "The horcrux did it!" is no justification! Hermione and Harry wore it too, but again Ron was the weak link!), despite the fact that he is guilty (as much as Harry and Hermione!) for not planning the 'crux-hunt propperly (like taking tons of food in Hermione's super bag (that can probably hold an Aircraft-Carrier if you dump it inside in pieces (or shrink it before tossing it in!))

As for Harry: Any instances where he is a bad friend? (Sure there are some where you might claim he should have picked a side, but why? That would hurt him in the long run, his neutrality in Ron vs. Hermione fights is what kept the trio together IMHO (Harry was the buffer between those two, he couldn't side with either!))

** Harry is a passive actor, a blank slate to insert oneself into so you can imagine what it would be like to be in his shoes.

Life comes to Harry and that includes his friends. His friends, his magic, his destiny, his wealth, his fame, his whole life are these things that are thrust on him through no action of his own.

There is more than one group dynamic to a group of friends. Hermione and Ron hang out with Harry but Harry does not do the same.

** I've had this conversation before, but I'd say no. I've seen plenty of “ Is Hermione/Ron a good friend to Harry”, but I have never seen this until now. I think Ron and Hermione are INFINITLY better friends to Harry than he is to them. ( okay, maybe a small exaggeration) Harry in canon is kinda self-centered for large portions of the series. He is dismissive of Hermione quite a bit and (as far as I remember) never thought he had any fault with his fight with Ron 4th year (but he did). Are his faults with his friendships justified? Maybe, he had a difficult upbringing. But lesser people than Ron and Hermione would have left Harry long ago. Hermione pretty much mothered Harry through 7 books and Ron had to pretty much swallow his pride in books 4 and 7( What I mean is Ron apologizes, Harry never does.)
