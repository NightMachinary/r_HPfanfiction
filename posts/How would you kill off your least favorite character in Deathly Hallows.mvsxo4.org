** Was just reminded of a fic where Umbridge was raped by the centaurs when she was carried off by them at the end of OotP. I can't think of a more fitting end for her than to die because she was carrying a centaur foal that was just too big for her body to handle. Maybe even twins for that extra twist of evil---she manages to birth the first one but can't take the prolonged labor when there turns out to be a second. Or maybe the second is breech. (Horses take a full year to have a baby. Since this is a magical animal I can easily justify a longer pregnancy rate, to delay it long enough to take place during DH instead of at the end of HBP.)

Ooooooooor, maybe acromantulae are parasitoids (insects that lay their eggs in other insects, and the larvae eventually eat them). Using that same scene (centaurs carrying off Umbridge) as the beginning of the story, the centaurs took her to Aragog's nest, and they implant eggs in her, while she thinks she was being "stung" by them. She doesn't understand why the "stinger" wounds don't heal properly, but doesn't want to see a healer and admit what happened so she's self-treating. All those hungry baby spiders eat her when they're born.

Dammit, and you're making me want to actually write these stories, when I've never written anything like this. I really hate Umbridge.

** Now that I think about this- I've never read a character committing suicide. ??

** I would like Runcorn to actually be accused of conspiring with the Muggleborns after Harry impersonating him helps them escape from the MoM and get killed by the Death Eaters. He seems like a shitstain who turned in innocent people when he had the power to protect them and we know too little about him to love to hate him like in the case of Umbridge. Besides getting killed for rescuing Muggleborns by the people to whom he reported them seems like a fitting and ironic end.

** - “Flowers by the Wayside” by TalaRae linkao3(23090008), except it is really not about a suicide, that's just a vehicle to get the story moving
- on the other hand, “[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1067936][Gryffindor tie(s)]]” by Amaru_Katari IS about a suicide (and its consequences) and please all relevant warnings apply. If anything triggers anything for you, then it is this story.

#+begin_quote
  After her husband is unfaithful and her cookie-cutter perfect world is turned on its head, Petunia Evans Dursley finds herself in her old hometown, full of regrets and feeling that her life has been without purpose. Before she can quietly take her own life, she is given an impossible offer by a long-dead figure from the magical world: return to the past, and rewrite her own history. Seeing it as a chance to make up for her biggest regret, Petunia accepts and finds herself in the middle of a Wizarding war she knew little about, protecting the younger sister she tried to forget by seeking help from the one person in the magical world she knows how to find.A what-if story beginning in the latter years of the first war against Voldemort, where an unlikely alliance turns into an even more unlikely romance, and the bonds that bloom from it will change the course of Wizarding history.
