I use to like the stories that were mostly contained inside Hogwarts , were the main protagonist were really Just harry and the DA faceing off against Umbridge and the Inquisitorial squad. No Voldemort,death eater or Hocruxies. The stories had a lightness to them that fanfiction nowadays just lack.

But sadly that type of story sadly died out years ago.


** Harry/Daphne as a pairing seems to have displaced every other pairing of Harry that isn't with a major supporting character or lead.

There was a time when there used to be quite a variety of Harry/Susan, Harry/Luna, etc but now it's all "Harry Potter melts the Ice Queen's heart".

***** I've never actually read either of them. Googling them, it looks like they're not particularly my kind of thing due to the Harry/Voldemort tag on again and again and basilisk born might be decent but I'm wary of bashing fics and Slytherin fics are often a huge mess of cliches.

Looking at my favourites list, I can only find two time loop stories\\
Linffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter) and linkffn(Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon). Book two of Backwards with a purpose might also sort of fit the category.\\
I'm not really sure if that answers ypur question though

****** Well, if you want to try, most of Again and Again you can read without any hint of HP/LV. Its very plot-heavy. I'm pretty sure Basilisk-born doesn't really have that much bashing. Except for Voldemort, but that is pretty much because of his aweful temper. And it portrays Dumbledore as somewhat incompetent. And has its own version of how the war against Grindelwald went, but that's my favorite part of the fic, so I'm afraid I can't tell you if there was bashing in that part or not. I just noticed the awesomness of it! So make your own choice and I will now go and read the two fics you pointed out as they have somehow escaped my notice before now.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

*** I've found a couple of really quite good ones recently - although they are a few years old: linkffn(12132374) - Hermione is sent back in time after the last battle, taking the place of a pure-blood girl killed before they could attend Hogwarts. Excellent Slytherin manipulations. The same author also has linkffn(11735486) which is good fun - Hermione centric again.

There's also the unfinished linkffn(12830596), which is very satisfying so far - Hermione becomes Lily's younger sister after an accident in the Department of Mysteries.

** The "Characters Read the Books" subgenre was the perfect junk food for me. Even the bare bone ones that would have like 85% of the focus literally just be the OG text. Character reactions were like crack to me. The meatier few that used the reading of the books as a jumping off point were truly, with relations to my interests, fanfiction's crème de la crème.

** Post-GoF AUs. I actually like a lot of characterization and backstory stuff we got in OotP, but I still miss how creative and varied people were in coming up with alternate ideas before it came out. Plus that feeling pre-OotP when the last thing we readers knew was that Voldemort was back and it looked like Dumbledore and Harry were both gearing up to fight him. Again, I like a lot of stuff in OotP, but Voldemort going underground and everyone dragging their feet dealing with him was a let down from the last chapter in GoF being titled "The Beginning".

** I agree with you. I miss the lighter, fluffier fics, but to be honest, there weren't that many of them even back in the day.

The other genre I miss is connected to the one that you mentioned, but different:

I miss the whimsical stories. Recently the vast majority of updating fics are very heavy and dark. There are very few, which embrace the fun part of magic, without the unnecessary drama (and there were quite a lot of them in the past, but right now, they seem to be dead). VonPelt could update No Longer Alone sooner for me to feel better, but alas....

*** Speaking of whimsy, I'm working on a story at the moment where there's a whole secret society of divination masters who call themselves "Fate's Hand," and are bound by oath to never reveal their organization's secrets...

Said oath just gives you a small magical jolt because they're really just a black-tie social club and they hardly do anything serious, nevermind illegal. The fun is that their base teleports to hidden locations at random and the only way to get in is to divine it's current location and find the gatekeeper (equivalent to a nightclub bouncer). Once you've proven yourself, they offer games and gambling for the precognitively minded and pride themselves on being so fast with their restaurant service that they'll have your food cooking before you even order it. And for those with actual business, they'll book you a private room before you even show up.

They may act all serious and occult, but really, the majority of them are just there to have fun amongst like-minded people who won't bother them every waking moment for another stupid prophecy.

*** I never understood how his gender could not be known. I mean, OK, it's not a frequent name in english speaking countries, so one may not know... but 30 seconds with google will give you the answer.\\
I mean, Blaise Compaoré was president of Burkina from 1987 to 2014; Blaise Pascal was a mathematician and physicist and theologian and the unit for pressure is named after him; Blaise Matuidi has been playing for the french soccer team since 2010; Blaise Cendrars is one of the most celebrated poets writing in french in the 20th century. Hell, a character named Blaise appears in La Morte d'Arthur!

** Wbwl Harry, but good Potters. Okay, the genre has not died down actually. But I feel the tone has. Too much bashing, too much hate and angst, practically made me avoid this genre altogether.

  If Harry's baby brother, Daniel, is the Boy-Who-lived, then what of Harry? What is his role? Is he destined for greater? Or, is he to play a much bigger role in the future? Follow Canon's plot, with much bigger AU's plot as the story progresses.

** 'Snape is Harry's biological father' stories. I stopped reading fanfiction around 5 years ago and when I came back last year there were pretty much no new good stories written during all this time save for 1 oneshot I found recently.

** Stories where horcruxes and hallows crap doesn't exist.

Stories where Snape is good for his own reasons and not because of lily crap.

AKA what fanfic was like before the crappy canon of book 6-7 was released. I've gotten used to it over the years, but books 6-7 were the only books I read just once and never repeated. I read books 1-5 hundreds of times before book 6 was released. Books 1-5 are falling apart. Books 6-7 are still in mint condition on my shelf.
