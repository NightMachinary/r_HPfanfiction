When I say well written I mean mostly believable and with that I mean that things in the story do not just happen because Harry is the main character.

This quarantine has pushed me to fanfic to remain sane and I stumbled upon a couple of jewels that got me into girl Harry, a corner of fanfic I had not approached before.

â€‹

The first one is A long journey home.\\
very famous fic as I have recently discovered, beautifully written. I actually cried at the end of the Myrddin arc. This is a good example of well written. Harry/Jasmine is overpowered not because she is extremely skillful out of nowhere or by virtue of been super smart or super gifted but because it is just unavoidable with that plot, circumstances in the story made it so and are extremely believable. If you have not read this you should and if you know anything with this quality, please recommend it to me.

The second one is The Never-Ending Road\\
I know Snape/Harry can be very off-putting but is just a testament of how well written this fic is that the story manages to be so good despite the main pairing. It's extremely slow and there is absolutely no romance between them for most of the story. The main selling point of this fic are the characters. Harry is not a Mary Sue she is very far from a perfect girl but is lovable and there is character development. She annoys me in some bits of the story but that is part of what makes it good, she has flaws that actually affect her. Her friendship with Hermione is awesomely sweet and so well managed just like her relationship with the rest of the characters, she does not have a harem, she is not extremely strong, she is not extremely smart, but you can actually see her getting stronger and more mature as the chapters go by. The Snape in this fic is also an awesome character and his banter with Sirius is just hilarious. Anything that is like this please let me now! and give it a chance if you haven't

I tried reading The Pureblood Pretense because it has so many good reviews but I could not.\\
I gave it a fair chance and kept reading despite not enjoying it from the very beginning but I just could not continue. It is simply not what I consider good writing without any offense intended to the fans or the writer that obviously put the effort into it, This is just my personal opinion.\\
As I read it I felt that the harry in this fic was going full speed into the train crash all Mary Sues ends at. The Author makes an effort to provide believable circumstances as to how two eleven-year-old kids can manage to change schools without anyone noticing but I just could not buy it. Harry is extremely well-liked from the very beginning, Is smart enough to plan this masterful deception, her relationship with her cousin is ideal, is extremely driven by her very realistic dream of being a potion master at eleven years old, and is a vegetarian... I could just feel the Harem coming at full speed so a dropped it. If you know of any works that are like this please do not recommend

When you recommend please tell me why I should read it, summaries are not that useful. Thank you for your help!


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12713828/22/Victoria-Potter][https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12713828/1/Victoria-Potter]] - note that the summary is inaccurate. It's a canon-themed world as opposed to a mostly canon world. The writing is excellent and the magic is a well thought-out conceptual magic system that closely mirrors canon.

** Linkffn(Yule Ball Panic by Philosophize) Linkffn(The odds were never in my favour by Antony444)

Personally Yule Ball Panic and its sequels are some of the best Fanfiction which edits very little from the Canon world.

The odds were never in my favor uses the canon world and adds to it in very interesting ways.

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...

** To be fair, a lot of the things you probably dislike about Pureblood Pretense are either things drawn from the Lioness series (the crossover series that inspired it), are phased out by the second book, or have plot reasons that appear later to make it make sense. For instance, she's a vegetarian for a reason that you learn later, not just to be a hipster cool!girl. The writing also gets massively technically better by the time third book comes around. But I recognize it's a lot of time to put into something that doesn't hook you from the beginning. It's your time and your reading preference, I just gotta put in for one of my favorite series either way ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜‰.

** And She Wears A Crown of Merigold: liknffn(12306575) MOD Female Harry lives in the Village hidden in the leaves and gets pissed when she's summoned to seal the nine tails inside Naruto by Minato (Who is basically her only real friend in this story.) A nice little one shot that is easy to get through.

The Unrelenting Frozen Sea: linkffn(10793290) a Percy Jackson Crossover that I remember enjoying a while back though it might not have aged so well. Female Harry is a daughter of Poseidon.

What Happens in Vegas linkffn(10561760) Female Harry is dragged to magical Los Vegas to loosen up by Tonks and a Reluctant Remus after the events of book 5. She ends up getting married to Raven of the teen titans.

Not Who She Seems linkffn(8425161) Female Harry is the Daughter of Lily Potter who is the younger sister of Thor and Loki in this story. I remember enjoying this alot and it had some fun character interactions especially with Cedric.

** Linkffn(13132217)

This one may be a little different since Harry turns into a girl during the story but, it's kinda nice and low stakes for the most part. I really liked it because you see Harry grapple with being a girl and what that means for Harry identity wise. It doesn't feel very angsty or sad however.

** Not sure on everything you said you disliked but effects and side effects is one of the best fem harry I've ever read. It does avoid the usual thing where they write harry as a girl just so they dont have to describe his junk but it's not horribly smutty. I'd give it a strong R rating but its gradual as they also deal with some of Harry's issues from growing up with the dursleys.
