After having read Duality, I enjoyed the vastly different portrayal of Daphne Greengrass it featured. I'm interested in reading more takes on characters that are breaks from the norm/unexpected. Not just looking for fandom characters either, main characters are welcome too, so long as the portrayal is believable. Few examples I could think of were: Slytherin Mad-Eye, Tonks with body dysphoria, Mrs Norris/Hedwig being animagi.

Stuff that while unexpected, could also easily make sense in canon. I understand that might be a very specific niche, but I'm open to recommendations!

Let me know if you have recommendations!


** The popular take is Lily Evans fighting for Muggleborn rights in school.

My own personal take is up until the end of fifth year Lily was one of those "both sides" people. The kind of person that would urge other Muggleborns to lay low and get along with the bigots. She'd fit right in with the fanon "neutral faction".

  The nargle infestation in Luna's dorm is acting up again, but the cure is surprisingly simple.

** So Sirius/Remus is a pretty standard ship, but a while ago I saw a comment here that claimed, given what we know of the Marauders' friendship dynamics, Sirius//James/ is more likely to have actually happened.

I mean, obviously James married Lily and then died, but for stories set in their schooling years it makes a certain amount of sense, especially given Remus's self-confidence issues.

** Concerning Daphne Greengrass I still prefer her version in linkffn(3912184;4236594) than stupid Heiress Greengrass from the normal Haphne story.

** Men Who Love Dragons Too Much? Maybe? It's...well, I don't know if this is a spoiler but if so, don't read what I'm about to write, Malfoy is a dragon animagus which I think could definitely make sense.\\
Then there's also the survival is a talent take on the snakes and chamber.\\
I'm also dabbling with a story in which Gryffindor and Slytherin were exes, and that gave birth to the Gryffindor House vs Slytherin House feud. It's a fun idea, no?
