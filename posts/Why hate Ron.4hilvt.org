So...why do people hate Ron? I'm genuinely confused, not because I love him but, well, hating Ron would require me to have strong emotions towards him. And I...don't. Unless my ambivalence towards him has evolved into an emotion. So, why do you hate him?

** Because he's the most human out of the trio and people have ridiculously high expectations of how characters should be. They can't accept that sometimes, we can act in a wrong way, and yet still be a fundamentally good person.

Oh, and yes, it's also because of the movies: we seem to forget that before the advent of the films, Ron was pretty much Hermione in terms of character popularity. Everyone simply loved Ron. But bit by bit, the films put his popularity into question, particularly with PoA and GoF, where Ron's characterization is placed in a much more negative light (Ron's reaction to Snape calling Hermione a know-it all, Hermione saying "kill us before you get to Harry" instead of Ron, etc.).

** I used to hate Ron.

I hated him because I knew people like him in real life - people who expected to be given stuff without putting in any hard work for them, and would become abruptly and loudly jealous if other people got stuff they wanted, whether it was by chance or through hard work.

I disliked how he constantly wanted to copy homework, avoid any semblance of graft, and wanted other people to do things for him, pretty much. I just thought that he was weak, frankly, and I couldn't like him as I saw him that way.

Now, I don't really hate him, because hating characters is a big waste of time, but I know I'd dislike him if he was a real life person, and he's never going to be a character I dote on in fanworks.

*** Don't forget Harry was also always copying homework off Hermione and Harry was also relying on Hermione to organise the DA, do the Horcrux research, organise the Horcrux hunt trip etc and I don't see Harry being hated for it, double standard much?

Ron blew up once at Harry over his jealousy of Harry's fame during the Triwizard Tournament over 7 books and it should be said Harry did nothing to make things better. He even overcame his remaining jealousy issues in DH when he stabbed the Horcrux. However, I can't remember a single time where he was jealous of Hermione's academic achievements or her brains, plus he was always the first person to praise her for her brilliance. He was also the first person to praise Harry when he got an ‘O' on the DADA OWL.

** I don't hate ron, but i have nothing to really like about him either. I don't hate him because theres really nothing too hate, i mean he's a good friend with a good heart for the most part. yet his negative traits cancels out his positives.

throughout my middle and high school years, i've had the great pleasure with meeting loud-mouth, emotionally unstable pubescent teens like ron, thing is unlike ron, they're absolutely dreadful people. That's where the problem lies, in my experienced i've never met a single person who has both ron's positive and negative traits, as it just doesn't fit. a loyal friend would be understanding and thoughtful whilst someone who is jealous and insecure wouldn't able to land a single relationship. and the whole /ron acts as a teenager/ excuse simply doesn't cut it as i'm good friends with people whom i never thought i'd even share a table with because teens mature and i just don't see that level of development from ron's character.

He bores me too. Brave and undoubtedly loyal friend who has the mentality of a teenager. nothing bad about that, i love reading interactions of two close mates as much as the next guy but as it stands, i just see ron's character too one-dimensional.

**** His jealousy is only a small part of his character and it certainly didn't impact his relationship with Harry except for a very few isolated incidents. Ron blew up once at Harry over his jealousy of Harry's fame during the Triwizard Tournament over 7 books and it should be said Harry did nothing to make things better. However, I can't remember a single time where he was jealous of Hermione's academic achievements or her brains, plus he was always the first person to praise her for her brilliance. He was also the first person to praise Harry when he got an ‘O' on the DADA OWL. He even overcame his remaining jealousy and insecurity issues in DH when he stabbed the Horcrux so the jealousy issue is no longer a valid point by the end of the series.

Ron not understanding other people is a mixed case at worst. Does he have blind spots where he didn't understand other people as a typical teenager? Of course! However he also showed lots of understandings of other people when others don't. For example, he seemed to understand Harry's desire to not to be nagged and to have fun at times better than Hermione and he understood the elves in GoF and OotP better than Hermione did. Also remember during the whole Triwizard fight Harry never understood Ron's insecurities and were all about himself even when Hermione pointed it out to him. Therefore I would say even the best friends can seriously misunderstand each other at times.

I could go on with more examples if you want to but I think you get the idea now.

Yes, Hermione, as the oldest amongst other reasons, was always the most mature of the Trio. However Ron has done lots of maturing as well especially in the last two books no matter what you think. I'll just list 3 examples for your reference.

1) Coming to the realisation that he actually prefers a plain nerdish bookworm as a girlfriend who can challenge and make him work harder over a girl who seems to throw herself at him, worship him and satisfies his desire for “physical experience” but couldn't seem to have an intelligent conversation

2) Stabbing the locket Horcrux showing that he overcame his jealousy and worst fear that his girlfriend preferred his best friend over him

3) Going from an attitude of the “house elves are happy with their current conditions so leave them be” to one where their safety came first because they shouldn't die for humans

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, he did that, but he was 14 and 17 at the time
#+end_quote

So was I. I think if I have to justify my hate for him during my first read, the argument was very sound. I identified with Harry and Hermione a lot. Ron got the first big strike when he pulled his stunt in 4th year and Harry just forgave him. It broke a lot of the identification I had with Harry because, frankly, I would have dumped Ron on the spot. From then on out, well, Ron became more and more like the guys I loathed in real life, therefore I disliked the character more and more. His stunt during the horcrux hunt just made me want to see him gone. Instead he got the girl. My hate was complete.

Nowadays, I still dislike his character. But I'm far away from any sort of hate. In my last reread of the books, I simply thought that he has some serious issues to deal with that I personally would not have the patience to deal with as a friend.

Its also why I refrain from using him as a character in my stories. If I have to, I constantly have to edit his lines in order to get the bash out that I dump upon him.

I'm well aware that Ron has a lot of good qualities and I can see why some people might like him. But I personally disliked him from Book 4 onwards and haven't stopped yet.

I doubt very many of us would have the loyalty or bravery to follow our friends into such a situation in the first place. Given that, it feels somewhat dishonest to criticise Ron for not following through when he already showed far stronger friendship and loyalty than we would have.

An interesting analogy but it's missing an important element: a more accurate one would be if /your friend was the only one who could possibly do it, and if he didn't, ISIL would almost certainly take over the world/. I think that many more people would go. Your analogy focuses on personal loyalty, but there was also a utilitarian dimension to it.

However, the utilitarian dimension does not negate the fact that /Ron could have chosen to sit the whole war out/: he is a pureblood, so he could have just followed his brother Percy's example and cut ties to Harry Potter and to his blood-traitor family. That he chose not to does show this friendship and loyalty.

I did write that I see that he has some good attributes. But for me, personally, his bad characteristics far outweight the positive.

The comparison also doesn't hold up. Our world isn't that black and white. There is no Chosen One to end ISIS. Our armies aren't incompetent, and so on and so on.

Also, I'd probably have the loyalty and bravery to smack my friend over the head and ask him if he did a bit too much of some strange drug if he comes up with such a plan.

The haters who claimed the analogy with ISIL irrelevant because Voldemort was actively hunting down everyone in the country missed the fact that even though the Weasleys were considered blood traitors, they were STILL allowed to go about their daily lives because they are pure-bloods so Voldemort does not impact them as much as Harry and Hermione. It makes Ron's decision to go on the hunt even more heroic than the other 2 because he DID NOT HAVE TO.

*** I dont like Ron all that much either. But blaming him for his actions during the Horcrux Hunt doesnt really make sense to me. He was carrying Slytherins Locket at the time. It was made pretty clear that the Locket was influencing them all. As soon as Ron had given the Locket away and taken a few minutes to calm down he would've returned - only he couldnt anymore.

Ginny tried to kill people with a giant Basilisk when she was under the influence of a Horcrux. It seems to me like throwing a bit of a temper tantrum at your friends is pretty minor compared to that. Yet hardly anybody ever blames Ginny (and if they do it's because she was stupid enough to write in the diary, not because of what she did while posessed) but all the Ron haters are pretty quick to bash Ron for his actions during DH.

Ron, on the other hand, could have lived a relatively comfortable life under Voldemort despite the oppression like going back to Hogwarts because he's a pure-blood. This is the difference you seem to be missing.

The fact that his family will be targeted and possibly killed if the Death Eaters found out he was helping Harry (yes this is a BIG disincentive for him to go on the mission and helps the Horcrux a lot in its mission to instill negative emotions in Ron) while Harry and Hermione does not need to worry about their families if they were discovered working against Voldemort seem to have escaped your notice as well.

*** Harry did not dump Ron because 1) He did not have perfectly either like how he chucked a badge at Ron when Ron showed concern for his safety on the night he talked to Sirius and 2) Ron was the first to recognise he was wrong and 3) One mistake or fight among friends does not destroy a real friendship no matter what you think.

OK, let's now talk about the two events you seemed to be so bothered about. The fight he had with Harry during the Triwizard Tournament happened because he felt betrayed that Harry went ahead and entered the tournament without him, not simply because he was jealous of famous Harry's attention. Plus, Harry could simply have explained to Ron when Ron ASKED about Dumbledore's speculation that someone entered him to kill him. Instead of talking, he chose to feel butthurt. Then the next day, Hermione who understood Ron's feeling of inferiority pointed it out to Harry but Harry chose to feel even more butthurt instead of trying to talk to Ron. Ron was still concerned with Harry's wellbeing when they were fighting (even though he might not have shown it) otherwise he would not have went downstairs to the common room to try to find Harry when Harry was talking to Sirius at the fireplace. I wouldn't even classify Ron walking out in DH as abandonment. Remember he wanted to come back the moment he Disapparated but he was prevented from doing so because he ran into some Snatchers. So it's more like getting away from the distressing mess they were in and cool down for a few minutes and then return which is not a crime. People also forgot that he alone was splinched and almost killed when they escaped from the Ministry and he had the most to lose by going on that quest. This is because 1) Unlike his best friends, he can go back Hogwarts and enjoy a relatively comfortable life despite the oppression because he's pure-blood and 2) His family will likely be targeted, tortured and killed if the Death Eaters ever found out that he was helping Harry Potter. So it doesn't mean he's a coward or traitor for not feeling well during the trip. Also Harry already told Ron to bugger off three times during their fight before he left so it's not like Ron just decided to leave suddenly. Of course, in some people's books, the fact that Harry also the leader refused to try to talk rationally with his followers instead just tell them to leave mean absolutely nothing.

What? Ron became more like the guys you loathed in real life? Firstly, don't bring real life characters into discussion about fictional characters because for every example you list someone else can bring in a counterexample. Secondly, he was a completely loyal friend to Harry in OotP and HBP even when Harry was being bratty so where is the transition that you are talking about? He got the girl (which sounds really condescending towards Hermione you know because it sounds like she's a prize or trophy that should be awarded to the most worthy male) because 1) he cared for her personal life in a way that Harry her other best friend never did and 2) He offer qualities like humour among others things that she really needs in a relationship. I could list out a whole list of reasons on why they should be together if you want to. Seriously hate him all you like but don't go around applying double standards when discussing fictional characters.

I was under the impression you were passing on that statement as objective and covering all the real hated guys, sorry that I misunderstood you. However I was interested to know in what ways did Ron become the guys you loathed since he was pretty loyal in OotP and HBP?

In your first paragraph in your analysis of his character you listed several of his actions as reasons for your dislike of him and I have the right to point out why I disagree with you and where I think you're wrong using evidence from the canon (feel free to rebut my points civilly).

** There are several reasons why, but it's fundamentally less to do with Ron and more to do with Harry and Hermione.

His worth is usually thrown into question alongside his friends' accomplishments. Hermione is a brilliant academic. Harry vanquished the Dark Lord. /Twice/. Who is Ronald Weasley in comparison?

Easy: he's the fucking King.

As others have already mentioned, he has shown willingness to die for his friends on multiple occasions, and his heinous act of treachery in DH was a brief spat that unexpectedly turned into extended leave. Yes, Ron is hot-headed, and often tactless. But is Harry that much different? As for his supposed 'laziness', I'm pretty sure that Ron's OWLs were very close to Harry's save DADA.

But why is he the King? He's the King because he threw down with life-size wizard chess pieces. He's the King because he drove his Dad's car how the freaking birds fly. He's the King because he still managed to Conjure slugs with little more than a broken wand and haphazard incantation. He's the King because, school record notwithstanding, he was still made Prefect over Neville, Seamus and Dean. His coronation took place not on the Quidditch pitch, but in the Forest of Dean as he stabbed his greatest fears into oblivion. Eh Stunned Snatchers and didn't afraid of anything: he's a pretty cool guy, dammit!

Ron is the realest.

  There are several reasons why, but it's fundamentally less to do with Ron and more to do with Harry and Hermione.
#+end_quote

I agree with this and would like to highlight another side of it, although the relative obviousness of Harry and Hermione's accomplishments is certainly a factor. The relative obviousness of their pain is also huge. When something happens that hurts Harry or Hermione, it's immediately apparent, especially when that something is Ron. For Harry, we have the benefit of his point of view, so all of his feelings are immediately apparent, and Hermione is less emotionally guarded than the other two, especially in the books, so she is more likely to just cry in the open or say how she feels outright. Ron is constantly hiding his emotions and not letting others see what bothers him, which is very realistic not only as a teenage boy but as the last of six boys in a family where the youngest is also the only daughter. Because the audience doesn't see Ron's fear or sorrow or pain the way they see it for the other two, it's easier to say that he's just selfish or emotionally unaware.

- He stood up to Sirius Black in front of Harry & Hermione, despite a broken leg

- He destroyed the locket

- He disarmed Bellatrix, stunned Greyback, and knocked out a few others in the Malfoy Mannor

- He came up with the idea to use basilisk fangs to destroy horcruxes

By the way also remember that in GoF (the book where Ron had jealousy issues) this “asshole” allowed himself to be used as stunning cushion just so Harry could get some practice for the Third Task where if Harry won he gets no glory himself whatsoever.

He is poor, the seventh son, he feels the weight of his popular, powerful brothers and is terribly insecure. He also is too tall and doesn't know what to do with his limbs, which I definitely felt for awhile. If anything Ron feels the realest of all of these characters. The shame he felt at his poverty, the insecurity he feels in his own skills, his crush on the smart girl, he feels the most human of them all.

Harry has never sought out fame or attention despite how much of it the wizarding public would love to shower him with them. He is incredibly selfless when it comes to protecting others from danger, as he has demonstrated over the past three books/years. Harry is just the last fucking person who would ever voluntarily enter something like the Triwizard Tournament. He just wants to be normal!

He accuses him of entering himself which, as the books have established, is literally the opposite of what Harry would ever do. Ron then essentially calls Harry a liar when Harry is like, "Dude, I didn't put my name in, WTF," and gives him the silent treatment for weeks (months?). One of the few people Harry should be able to count on knowing better. I don't remember him even apologizing to Harry when he comes crawling back after his toddler tantrum. /Fuck/ Ron.

You must be labouring the under delusion that friendships must be perfect otherwise they are not friends. Rowling showed in the books that all friends can misunderstand each other a lot. Yes Ron did not understood Harry and was being a jerk here, but don't forget Harry had lots of blind spots towards his best friends over the years as well. For example, Hermione understood why Ron reacted that way and explained to Harry but did Harry ever step back and considered his friend's problems? Don't think so. So why the Ron-bashing double standard here? The silent treatment went for around 3 weeks by the way and during that time Harry refused to talk with Ron as well so don't go around pinning all the blame on Ron and excusing everything Harry did. Plus, Harry could simply have explained to Ron when Ron ASKED about Dumbledore's speculation that someone entered him to kill him. Instead of talking, he chose to feel butthurt. Then the next day, Hermione who understood Ron's feeling of inferiority pointed it out to Harry but Harry chose to feel even more butthurt instead of trying to talk to Ron. Ron was still concerned with Harry's wellbeing when they were fighting (even though he might not have shown it) otherwise he would not have went downstairs to the common room to try to find Harry when Harry was talking to Sirius at the fireplace.

He actually tried to apologise after the First Task but Harry didn't need to hear it. Don't forget that Harry never apologised to Ron for throwing a badge at him and hitting him on the head. By the way swearing at a character doesn't make your arguments any more convincing and in fact it's more likely to show you have an irrational hatred for him and what you said shouldn't be taken seriously.

No, Ron did not abandon Hermione because he actually asked her whether she wanted to come with him. One of the reasons Ron left was because he was the person who wouldn't be persecuted even Harry had thoughts about leaving but stopped because he couldn't. You still haven't responded to stefvh's comment about the Horcrux being able to distort one's mind. Remember also Harry showed little understanding of the Horcrux distorting his mind by his insistence that everyone keeps wearing it for example and that he wanted to come back the moment he Disapparated but he was prevented from doing so because he ran into some Snatchers. So it's more like getting away from the distressing mess they were in and cool down for a few minutes and then return which is not a crime.

Actually you could count on him like in the example stefvh cited in CoS where Ron was willing to confront his own fear and risk his life to help out his friends (you never acknowledged this btw). He was even able to do what he needed to do to get them out of the danger.

#+begin_quote

Don't remember when Ron raised legitimate concerns about the mission like they were not making progress or his family will be targeted but then Harry lashed out and told him to go home, so no I wouldn't say Ron can't be counted as Harry, his leader, literally told him to go home three times before he stormed out for a few minutes. Therefore he didn't leave because he was being selfish. Also could you read my response to UndeadBBQ on the DH issue for a bit more detail on what was happening?

#+begin_quote
  Well, the DH incident does count. It's still something Ron did of his own volition. I also think it's totally fair to judge him on one incident if that incident is significant enough.
#+end_quote

Actually people don't have a demand for perfect friends like you do, especially when they have been acting badly themselves as well. If Ron had actually gone and betrayed Harry to the Death Eaters like Pettigrew did to James and Lily, then yes I would say that incident is significant enough. Are you seriously claiming though what Ron did is similar to what Pettigrew did?

Just because you are appalled doesn't mean your judgment is correct as many people have shown you and you have never really refuted those counter arguments that were brought up as well as dismissing his attempts to make amends like actually LEADING the trio in their Horcrux quest while Harry was obsessing over the Deathly Hallows and abandoned his own mission. Personally, I think his lowest point in the whole series was when he lashed out at Hermione over Krum in HBP (even that was understandable because Hermione kept telling him they were just friends so Ron felt he was betrayed, but obviously the right and mature thing would have been to talk with her over his problems).

Seriously hate Ron all you like nobody can stop you from doing it but don't go around making up lies about him.

If we were to conveniently ignore Ron getting near to the exact same grades as Harry (grades that were still pretty good overall), does a Harry that just buries himself in work and never have any fun from his friends sound enjoyable to you? Have you not been a teenager in a while? Besides, it's not Ron's fault that Harry isn't a straight O student, if he really cared enough, he'd be working all night long. Heck, Hermione's grades are brilliant and she's also Ron's best friend.

#+end_quote

Yes fun probably shouldn't be among his priorities after Voldemort returned (although when Dumbledore wasn't giving him tasks to do he didn't really have that much to on with in the quest to defeat Voldemort) but what about before that and even when Voldemort did return it doesn't mean they shouldn't have fun once in a while as part of being human.

By the way it's not really possible to get through teenage life with no life at all. Ron might be a distraction yes which can be both positive and negative as Englishhedgehog13 pointed out Harry needs to have fun SOMETIME, but he could also focus on the mission when things got tense like those times when they were on those crazy adventures for instance.

Why are you claiming that Ron is lazier when it comes to study than Harry? What is your evidence for that assertion?

** I disliked him in the first book for starting off as a bully, that never changed (even when he became prefect he used it to harass lower years). I think he was meant to have a similar role as Xander in Buffy, but where Xander is actually funny/lovable most of the time, Ron is just an immoral #$@! from his first scene all the way to the epilogue. I hated him when I was 10 (1999) and started reading the books and while I don't hate him anymore (he's a fictional character), I think he's by far the character I dislike most in the entire universe.

That Rowling forced a relationship between him and my favorite character is what drove me to read/write Fanfiction, and dismiss the last 2 books completely when it comes to canon.

I don't want to get into (another) argument on Ron's character, but I wanted to answer your question from my own perspective as there were again people claiming people only dislike him because of the movies or because of the last book, and that really is not the case for me at all.

*** Really? Ron is a bully in the first book? Like befriending a shy kid who sat alone himself is bullying behaviour? The mean thing he did in the first book is to call Hermione a "nightmare" behind her back when she was being pompous and a stuck-up know-it-all. He actually felt bad about it when he realised Hermione heard him, what does that say to you? Did you forget that as soon as he realised she was in danger from the troll, he actually risked his own life to save her even when she wasn't his friend?

I don't know about you but someone who keeps risking his life to help out his friends is anything but immoral. Yes, he showed doubts and anger at times, but it doesn't negate the fact he was willing to put his life on the line many times.

Rowling didn't force Romione to happen, it developed naturally no matter what you think. The fact you denied the last 2 books are canon (and don't forgot the first hints of Romione actually came in CoS if not in the first book) just show what type of fans you are.

You seemed to be confusing Ron with Malfoy who actually did harass the lower students when he was made a prefect.

I know that Ron bashing is frowned upon but if it's cleverly written its one of my guilty pleasures because it just works so well (as long as you are willing to jump through the mental hoop of him being much much worse than in canon).

I probably share your ambivalence towards the character, but that's a big reason why him being portrayed as an idiot or an asshole can work so well. IMHO linkffn(5483280) does a pretty great job of expressing those feelings. It's just fun to laugh at him. For some reason I never feel bad about bad things happening to him in these fics.

I'm sorry, but that's a bit a low number. The first thing Snape does in the books is complain about Harry being a celebrity (without knowing him at all).

And I know for sure that this isn't the only time he does something like this, so I'm confident to say that he does it at *least* twice. How many conversations do Snape and Harry have over all the books (it's probably not all that many)? In how many of those does Snape refer to Harry as arrogant or compare him to his father in some way?

I mean, he even goes out of his way to do it when talking about Harry with others:

#+begin_quote
  “How touching,” Snape sneered. “But surely you have noticed that Potter is very like his father?”

  “Yes, I have,” said Sirius proudly.

  “Well then, you'll know he's so arrogant that criticism simply bounces off him,” Snape said sleekly.

I specifically remembered another time besides those I mentioned, but couldn't pin it down.

I just took a look through PoA and there's 2 occurances in that book alone:

#+begin_quote
  “How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter,” Snape said suddenly, his eyes glinting. “He too was exceedingly arrogant. A small amount of talent on the Quidditch field made him think he was a cut above the rest of us too. Strutting around the place with his friends and admirers ... The resemblance between you is uncanny.”

  “My dad didn't strut,” said Harry, before he could stop himself. “And neither do I.”

  “Your father didn't set much store by rules either,” Snape went on, pressing his advantage, his thin face full of malice. “Rules were for lesser mortals, not Quidditch Cup-winners. His head was so swollen ---”
#+end_quote

[this rant actually goes on for a while longer, but I'll spare you]

and

#+begin_quote
  “SILENCE! I WILL NOT BE SPOKEN TO LIKE THAT!” Snape shrieked, looking madder than ever. “Like father, like son, Potter! I have just saved your neck; you should be thanking me on bended knee! You would have been well served if he'd killed you! You'd have died like your father, too arrogant to believe you might be mistaken in Black --- now get out of the way, or I will make you. GET OUT OF THE WAY, POTTER!”
#+end_quote

IMHO the pure maliciousness and insanity of those 2 rants should actually make them count for more than one occurance each.

I'm not saying that Snape mentions Harry's arrogance or his father everytime, but I think he mentions it often enough (percentage-wise) that it can be considered a character trait. I just don't think it's as over the top as you make it out to be.

He seems absolutely irate, mad, almost a caricature here (it's in all-caps and he actually "shrieks"). JKR's writing certainly isn't above criticism and some writers just seem to follow her footsteps.

I would criticize the fanfic if it were portraying him as nothing /except/ that, yes. However, if I'm not mistaken, the third book is the only one I remember him acting so insane in, as he is dealing with his teenage issues the most. He was basically reliving his school years again, only this time he had the upper hand with Black and Lupin, one person who almost killed him and the other who /sent him to his death/. I can fully believe Snape losing control in this case. Remember when he blew up in the infirmary later on? He had just pulled a coup de grace over the two last Marauders and was deliriously high on victory; He was even going to get a medal for it. Then he got the rug pulled out from under him. This does not incline people, least of all someone as emotionally immature as Snape, toward a reasonable response.

I'm not defending him, I'm simply explaining those particular reactions. It was an extreme reaction because for him, it was an extreme situation.

** Ron doesn't have very many strong character traits that are positive in canon. He's sport-obsessed, brash, lazy, gluttenous, disloyal, he doesn't apply himself, has low self-esteem, he can come off as slightly entitled, and he is a slob. Sport-obsessed is the least negative of all these, but doesn't really appeal to many people that heavily read Fanfiction

All of the other traits he has are ones that most people have to varying degrees, but people don't like associating themselves with those traits. I would say the most common reason for the hatred of them is hatred of those traits in themselves.

*** I will never understand the disloyal thing. Fourth year, he felt like Harry betrayed him not by entering his name into the Goblet, but by not telling Ron he did so and offering to get Ron's name in. Sure, he was wrong, but it's understandable.

As for the whole Deathly Hallows thing? First, he was injured. Second, he was trying to recover from injury while on the run, without proper care. Third, he had a piece of Voldemort's soul around his damn neck. All of that is a prime material for tempers to flare, leading him to leave. Only reason he didn't come back essentially immediately is because he had some shitty luck by apparating into a group of Snatchers, and by the time he got free Harry and Hermione had left.

Good on you for admitting your bias, most haters on this thread aren't able to even do that.

Where is the evidence that Ron withheld vital information from Harry during the Triwizard Tournament? I already explained in other posts what Ron's problems are and how Harry wasn't perfect either maybe it will help you to read them when you can.

No, Ron only left for some weeks and nowhere near 4 months because remember it was already freezing cold by the time they had the fight which is not September weather.

Ron left for a few minutes in DH when they were in no immediate danger at all due to the protective charms and after Harry literally told him to go home three times during their fight. Getting away from the distressing mess they were in and cool down for a few minutes and then return is not a crime. The damage done should have been no more than if one of the Trio left for a while to go search for food while leaving the other two in the tent.

#+begin_quote

Yeah he asks Hermione if he can copy her essay, but so did tons of guys in my real life. Hermione (and I ) say no and they eventually go away and do it themselves. School sucks sometimes and sometimes it's boring and yeah sometimes I was like did you read that essay about Jacksonian economics because damn I do not want to do it. It's like if you wanna talk entitled, let me introduce you to my first novel, Draco Malfoy and his limp wristed bigot problems. Draco and his deserving of his pure magic, his spot on the Quidditch team, his lavishly adoring crew of sycophants and rich snobs, his demands for preferential treatment over others, his constant sneering, smug ass kissing. Ron and Draco are alike in one way and that's the Sacred 28, not a sense of entitlement.

Speedheart, you hit the nail spot on in your post especially the part about Malfoy. We're still waiting for Riversz to respond to you. The only thing I could add is that Ron has actually grown out of the habit of copying Hermione's homework. For example, when they were doing the Dementor essay in HBP when his quill went wrong he actually asked Hermione for her quill so he can write the essay conclusion himself.

** People tend to project their own insecurities in fictional characters. the fact that Ron wasn't a paragon of virtue and loyalty irks some people plus he got to bang +Ema Watson+ Hermione, the bastard

*** Yep, I totally agree the fact that Ron “got the girl” made a lot of people even more hacked off at him. It doesn't matter he has all those good qualities that only get dismissed anyway. Their favourite arguments include “Ron doesn't deserve Hermione” or “Ron isn't good enough for Hermione”. The fact just see her as a prize or trophy to be awarded to whichever man (generally) they think is the most “worthy” instead of someone with actual feelings who made her own choice doesn't matter. The fact your post got down-voted so much just confirms they don't like what you're saying.
