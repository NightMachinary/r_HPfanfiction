What system of magic to you think would be best applicable to harry potter?

The entity that posts upon this account sees harry potter magic as being a clusterfuck plothole nightmare scenario where some people have magic at seeming random though affected by birth where magic works by way of "I believe in fairies so good things will happen" or based randomly at the whims of man reality will warp itself so long as it warps to benifit man combined with the fact that having and using wands is essentially "I believe in fairies harder" with some wands causing "I believe in fairies so hard my belief died and told death to fuck off because i beleive so hard" and belief is funneled through the mystical power of faux latin.

Even if you find more sense in Rowling magic it remains a clusterfuck and We challenge all who oppose that statement to a wizard's duel in the trophy room at midnight!

so what system of magic do you like?


** My ideal system in general (no Harry Potter)? Fullmetal Alchemist's.

In terms of Harry Potter, probably linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin)'s. It covers the origins of magic and integrates tons of disparate concepts into one system.

Examples include: Accidental Magic, Wandless Magic, Divination, Non-European Magical Traditions, House-Elf Magic, Extending "Feeling-Based Magic" (e.g. the Patronus), Occulmency/Legimency, Metamorphmagic/Animagic/Werewolves, Parsletongue, Magical Cores

In some parts the series does read as a "fix canon" fic, so the author tries to make something workable from all the things in canon, which I think is successful.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Honestly I see Nasuverse being a good system since it gives good reason for pretty much everything with magic needing intelligence to use safely so that kids need to go to Hogwarts wands being generalized mystic codes to aid in the focusing of concepts into spherical prana constructs and the faux Latin being generalized arias to form prana constructs, the need for emotion being parts of some spells with the killing curse being a temporary spherical materialization of the concept and will of man to kill in cold blood for hatred and the Patronus being a temporary manifestation of the concept of a kind guardian to ward away malice which then takes the form of the non-sophont best attuned to the soul of the castor, the deathly hallows are noble phantasms, this is all made greater by the fact that the world of Harry Potter is either leaving or entering an age of the gods accounting for the presence and weakness of supernatural beasts in meaningful quantities.

In other words forgoing a full merging of the moonlit world TYPE-MOON has enough I believe in fairies bullshit to survive Rowling's works while making shit make sense.
