Considering writing a bit of a creature-HP fic. I have very good worldbuilding reasons for this to happen. Either getting the power or the power itself will be how HP survived that Oct 31. I considered Phoenix or Basilisk, but that's so oft-done, and hard to not write overpowered!HP with. Also, although LP could plausibly have made her own Basilisk, a Phoenix would be harder to procure.

I am thinking about 'inventing' a magical creature that will be a thinly disguised Pokemon shoutout. Any thoughts on what would be cool, yet not break everything, especially if HP goes animagus (which I would prefer, if only because I invented an awesome explanation for why so few do it, yet three teenagers, one of whom might be barely competent, pulled it off).

My first thought was to find one that could plausibly give me an "OMG it's a Crumple-Horned Snorcack" scene, but alas it is not to be.

So, what does the internet have to throw at me?

/braces because I know what I'm actually going to get/


** Gargoyle. Can only change into one in the dark. If in gargoyle form, sunlight will cause him to turn to immobile stone until the sunlight goes away.

Able to enter the Headmasters staircase without a password. Members of the Goyle family may have some familial magic to command gargoyles much like the Imperius.

*** oooh a kraken...

The way everything's set up, Lily had set up the creature-infusion ritual as an 'in case Voldie finds us' thing. Ritual requires human sacrifice as well as the creature to be infused.

Creature-infusion is how the humanoid non-baselines humans came to be, as well as the various heritable magical abilities, it's considered a very dark ritual. The people who ended up with large obvious changes (everyone but metamorphmagi and Parselmouths) are ostracized, although they're still fertile with baseline humans (Prof. Flitwick) because magic, I guess. Original 'Pureblood' trope was directed specifically against 'tainting' blood with 'monsters'. Mundaneborn discrimination came later, and the word's usage evolved over time. So there's a high risk that they'll screw over HP if they go through with it, anyway.

James holds off Voldie so Lily can trigger ritual. Voldie walks into ritual at just the wrong moment, and ends up being (also) a human sacrifice, or is targeted as one of the creatures (thus neatly implying a fitting into almost-canon, kinda - there voldie is the only target). So HP gets Parselmouth from Voldie, and is truly HoS if I decide to go that route (won't matter much, because of the decisions I made on how the society functions).

HP WILL get a snake. Because I like snakes.

I quite like your idea, because squids and octopi I rank not far below snakes....

Ooh - then I can call [[https://xkcd.com/520/]]. Do you know what 200 DPI skin means? Cast runes like they're spells, really fast. :)

Wait, can metamorphmagi alter their own bones and skin to have arbitrary runic sequences engraved on them on the fly?

/Mr. Burns Excellent/

IIRC, I read a pretty good fic wherein Luna's family bred various Eldritch horrors, such as shoggoths...
