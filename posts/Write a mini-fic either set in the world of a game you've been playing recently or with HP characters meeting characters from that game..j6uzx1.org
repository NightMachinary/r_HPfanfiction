** "Dammit! How did we ended up locked up in this room?!" Ron whined.

"Doesn't matter! Run! Fawkes may have blinded the basilisk but it can still eat us in a mouthful!"

Harry and Ron hurried, turning left, then right a couple of steps later. They met the wall so they turned again. The basilisk was relentless. At one time, a giant Cherry appeared before them and the nasty thing ate it without stopping. For some twisted dark magic, the snake became larger. Each time a new oversized fruit appeared on their way, the basilisk ate it and each time it grew.

"Merlin, at least the thing can't seem to move diagonally!" Harry said.

"What was that about Diagon Alley?" Ron asked.

"Forget it, keep moving to that wall again,"

They did so, but then they decided to turn, and turn again... The basilisk's mouth followed them. At the last second they jumped away and the basilisk's mouth went directly for her own body.

Then, suddenly, it blinked and disappear.

"Bloody hell! It apparated away, you reckon?"

*** I've never heard of that game, but it seems like a fun idea for a crossover. /Elf Warden Murders Purebloods; Frees Elves/.

Also, your flair is the most honest I've ever seen a fellow Haphne shipper be.
