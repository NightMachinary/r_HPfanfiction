Why do Lazy!Harry fics always put him in hufflepuff even though a trait of Hufflepuff is hard work? This has always confused me.


** Flanderization, and lack of familiarity with canon. Or taking Hagrid and his "Load o' duffers" speech quite literally.

If you went to watch Crimes of Grindy in the cinema, one of the pre-movie ads was "Turn your phone off, don't be a Hufflepuff!", which is /so dumb/, because out of all the houses, Hufflepuff is the one that is most likely to be polite enough to care about other people's moviewatching experience.

** Hufflepuff is also the house of "all the rest", so when lazy Harry doesn't "fit" the other houses he's a leftover

Also the irony

**** That's a real fanon take there. That said, I don't think "all the rest" is necessarily bad. Helga Hufflepuff was a kind and accepting woman, and that's a good thing. Helga would take anyone and "teach them all the same".

**** um, no. Gryffindors are not lazy. We may be a bit reckless but that it mostly a sterotype. How would you feel if i said that all slytherins are evil mean people, or Ravenclaws are just stuck up nerds? Or if i said hufflepuffs were stupid useless weak people. Unite all houses, don't put one down just to make the other look good.

** In Harry the Hufflepuff, it was explicitly because he had none of the traits of any of the Houses (or, rather, they were all there in abundant amounts, but only to satisfy his sloth and for zero other reasons), and so it figured he'd at least have some support and possibly make something of himself in Hufflepuff.

*** BUT, Harry also worked extremely hard at being lazy. He was dedicated and spent an extraordinary amount of time inventing shit and networking so that his responsibilities would be taken care off while he spent as much time as he could napping.

He's also brave, ambitious, and clever about it.

** Harry IS lazy. And besides that, laziness is the literal opposite of Hufflepuff, so yeah, it's kinda stupid this happens

EDIT: I misread OP

** Mostly those fics are comedic, and it's a comedic understanding of Hufflepuff that gives them all the leftovers.
