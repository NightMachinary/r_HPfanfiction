Any story where Harry tries to act like he's hot shit, all Indy/Lord Potter-Black-Whatever, and gets beaten up because real life doesn't work like that?

Or completely ignored in a "Yeah, kid, sure. Go brush your teeth now, it's time for bed." kind of way.


** There's linkffn(What was your plan?) as a one-shot parody of that sort of Indy!Harry confronting Dumbledore

**** It is recommended rather often, isn't it? :P

Let's see - there's also linkffn(Harry Potter and the Manipulative Old Coot) for another short one-shot. I know there's also a few that parody the goblin side of the Indy!Harry one, like him 'recognizing' Griphook and getting it wrong, or getting screwed over when trying to claim his 'inheritance'.

  My take on the manipulative Dumbledore stories - from Dumbledore's point of view. Written late at night, not proof-read. Will probably go over it later, if people think it's worth a tidy-up.

  Harry has just begun his showdown with Evil!Dumbledore. Having shouted the various crimes perpetrated against him, he is unprepared for how the rest of the confrontation goes. ONESHOT

  Starts as parody of the formula most independant!Harry stories follow. Overly friendly Goblins, Manipulative Dumbledore, a shopping trip, a will from Sirius etc... Then it gets weird.

  ONESHOT, PostOotP. Parody on Severitus and Independent!Harry stories. VERY short, practically joke format.
