Read this ages ago, and can't remember if it was any good or even completed, but I need to read it again so I can get it out of my mind.

I'm only certain that Harry plays profesional Quidditch.

I think James and Lily is alive, and that he is a big brother. Also pretty sure it's a Harry/Fleur one, but I can't really remember. Other than that I remember my younger self thought Harry was very cool in it, lol.

Help.


** Sounds like HP and the Veela by Z-bond. Parents alive, is a big brother, plays pro Quidditch, and Harry/Fleur. linkffn(6864381)

*** That's the one! I remember thinking this was so good, but I have a feeling I might not like it that much anymore. It will however scratch the itch.

Thanks for the help!

**** Try reading Vitam Paramus by [[/u/TE7]] instead. Best quidditch fic I've ever read.

***** Trouble is it's basically a generic sports story with the names changed. Magic plays barely any role at all (or at least it didn't as far as I got to like 10 chapters in).

****** You're absolutely right that magic barely has any role at all. That's what I love about it... it focuses on the actual sport, the slow buildup of the relationship, and the characters. Magic doesn't need any role in it.

******* I would agree, but it seems like they push magic to the side to a point which is just unrealistic. Like if you have the ability to use magic to make life easier, do household chores, get home faster more easily etc. you would do so most of the time; just look at Molly Weasley. You could make a point about Harry preferring the muggle way sometimes, but most of the others are purebloods and using magic for everything would just be normal for them. There's no reason for them to constantly prefer the muggle way of doing things.

Also a more minor point which is partially Rowling's fault, the author talking about places like Ballycastle and Falmouth as though they're large cities, with large populations and many bars and stuff, rather than the villages they are. Also related, the way either everyone in those towns is a wizard or the statute of secrecy doesn't exist, because seemingly everyone knows them.

***** I'll check it out. The lack of magic mentioned puts me off a bit, particularly since Quidditch couldn't be more magical, but I've read some truly awful fics so it has to be worse than that to be a dealbreaker. Thanks!

**** Just re-read the first chapter and 'dumbledork' has already been used. So that sets the vibe. If you haven't read it before, probably skip it, the nostalgia is what's making me continue reading it.
