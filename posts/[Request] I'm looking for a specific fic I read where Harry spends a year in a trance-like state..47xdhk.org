Hello! I normally hate doing this, but this has been bothering me for weeks now. I'm looking for a specific fan-fiction I read some time ago in which Harry spends a school year or so in a trance-like state, basically "communing with magic" (or something along those lines). Harry still goes through the motions of attending classes and going to Hogwarts, but he's "not there" mentally. The only other part of the story that stands out in my mind is that Draco Malfoy (not a primary character in the story) is the only one of the "bad guys" who realizes that Harry has changed and become much more powerful. I'm not even sure if the fic was completed or if it was abandoned. Does any of that ring any bells for anyone?

Thanks a ton!

Edit: Upon thinking about it a bit more, I think there's also a scene where a centaur delegation bring gifts to the castle for Harry.

Edit 2: A very big thanks to [[/u/ThisIsForYouSir]] for identifying the story I was thinking of as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4659219/1/Veil-of-Shadows][Veil of Shadows]]!

  In the days after Sirius falls through the veil, Harry retreats into silence and watches as the scene repeats itself in his mind's eye. He knows that if he can just understand what was said by those whispering voices, that he could rescue his godfather.
