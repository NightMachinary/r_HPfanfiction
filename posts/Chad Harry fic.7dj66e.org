Hey guys. Requesting fics where Harry acts like a Chad in Hogwarts. I'm talking playing pranks Marauder style (and I mean actually funny pranks, not just “haha I colored your ties Gryffindor Red haha checkmate Slytherin”), sneaking out to go on beer runs, partying with the Gryffindor boys, and generally just being Alpha af. I'll also accept fics where he /tries/ to be alpha.

And before anyone says “durr OP got it from that dumb virgin/chad meme” no I fucking didn't you fucking normie. Chad Thundercock has been around for years, that's why it was chosen to parallel the Virgin walk.

Sorry if that comes off as harsh, I asked for a Chad Naruto thread and most of the replies were just talking about that meme.

So yea, Chad Harry fics. Slash is fine as long as it isn't shit like Harry/Voldemort or Harry/Snape.

** linkffn(Gryffindors never Lie) kinda fits the bill. But Harry is more of an alcoholic rather than Chad.

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)

  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Redone. Follow JKR plot, but Harry is calm, cool, & not cooperative. Harry finally living the role as popular. Parties, drinks, drugs, all the fun stuff in life. Complete. R&R.
