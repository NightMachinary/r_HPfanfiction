Yes, Ginnymort, the ultimate yandere.


** Yikes. What, does she yandere Voldemort & friends into the grave?

The power of love? Lol.

Y'know, this actually sounds pretty entertaining... Bonus points if she's always in a girlfriend Ginny version of perfect prefect Riddle mode when she's with Harry.

**** A much older Harry would later reflect that ever since the inexplicable collapse of the Death Eaters and the disappearance of Voldemort himself, his life seemed rather blessed.

He was immediately accepted to any job he applied for, and interviews seemed more formalities than anything else.

Political opponents and general media shit stirrers never persisted for long. The latter would often go so far as to make public apologies.

Hell, even that one asshole who broke his arm in one of the amateur quidditch league games soon suffered an accident that left him with a permanent physically debilitating injury, making it impossible to ride a broom.

Harry could never quite pinpoint when his luck did its complete reversal, but when he was feeling particularly sentimental he liked to think that it must have been the day of his very first date with the girl who would in time become his perfect wife.

** I do remember reading something like this on FFN. Can't remember what if was called though. I think it was set in 5th or 6th year, with the explanation that the Diary was already too joined with Ginny by the time it was destroyed, so the horcrux survived in some form.

** Not quite ginnymort but similarish I'd say the thorny rose series by brennus linkffn(9631998), linkffn(9969456), and linkffn(10288020). Brennus is also an excellent harry/ginny writer in general

Had to trawl through my watched list since it hasn't been updated in a while and couldn't remember the name. If I remember correctly, she starts off more Tom Riddle than Ginny but eventually swinging back. Skimming the story, I found some excerpts which kinda shows what kinda person Ginnymort is.

  ... Thank you," said Ginny, finally, her cheeks burning.

  Harry shot her a grin and just nodded. Ginny's stomach curled strangely, and she decided.

  She wouldn't kill Harry Potter yet. She'd discover all of the answers, first.

  She'd discover everything.
#+end_quote

And another one.

#+begin_quote
  Harry's eyebrows met, and Ginny started to talk. Her gut coiled in glee and fear all at once, and it took everything she had not to grin.

  She just had to help Harry kill his parents' betrayer, and then he would be hers.

**** Unfortunately, I dont think it's uploaded anywhere else. If it helps, you can click the Reader Mode button at the top right which will only display the threadmarks or the story itself. The only other way I can think of is downloading the story with omnibuser onto a different format.
