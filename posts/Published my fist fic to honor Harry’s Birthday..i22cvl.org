I wrote a small bit for fightfortherightsofhouseelves's "Happy Birthday Harry Writing Fest" on Tumblr. I chose not to write his 40th like many others were but something younger. It's been a long, hot minute since I've written anything so I welcome any feedback. Thanks for reading! I'll probably upload to ffn later.

*** Aww thank you so much! I have a whole idea of their relationship in my head that'll eventually make its way into writings.
