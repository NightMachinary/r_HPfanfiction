Along the lines of;

"Aha Ginny I know you've been love potioning me, how else would I randomly fall in love with you even though I never appreciated you until now"

"Firstly, rude, secondly, we spent all summer hanging out...you never really made an effort before..."

Ron is confused as to why Harry thinks they would be pretending to be poor if they'd been being bribed by Dumbledore all this time, I mean, it's not like Harry would need to know they had no money, or even what wizard poor would look like...not to mention using none of his money at any time...

After going to the Goblins for help Harry is charged 50,000 galleons for each blood test they did on him that have no legal bearing in court nor do they give him anything practical other a neat certificate for the wall saying "I went to Gringotts and all i got was this lousy proof of Gryfindor being a man whore"

After repeatedly explaining to Harry that he'd spent 5 years searching for ways to remove a Horcrux without destroying the container Dumbledore just fucks off out of his Hogwarts portrait for a holiday to the Bahama's portrait and leaves McGonnegal to try and work out why Harry thinks Hermione's Hymen would destroy anything.

Voldemort is surprised but pleased when Harry arrives with Malfoy proudly boasting that he's now a Grey^{TM} wizard like the rest of them and has renounced the light and will immediately follow all Pureblood customs and ignore stupid muggle holidays. Voldemort kills him on the spot then has Christmas dinner.

Hermione puts him in St Mungos permanently after the 9th time he's tried to kidnap her from her family declaring Ron a terrible father who's abusing her. Hugo cried again.

After demanding the goblins stop his money leaving his account this instant Harry is refused entry to Hogwarts for the year for unpaid school fees.

Everyone is very confused when Harry turns up with an apartment in his trunk, everyone knows the air filtration is terrible, although carbon monoxide poisoning would explain why he's wearing a basilisk skin suit despite no one wearing suits and snake skin being paper thin.

Harry is convicted of underage magic and believed to be clinically insane after his entire defence for the Patronus summer of 5th year consisted of screaming "I AM INNOCENT, SO MOTE IT BE" over and over again.

Harry finds an expensive lawyer to sue for emancipation from the Dursley's and set him up in a sweet manor in the Cotswalds. Death Eaters burn it to the ground with Dobby inside after they realise he no longer has any protection from his mothers sacrifice.

After demanding Lupin take him in as a ward like he should have done the whole time the ministry execute him as a dangerous beast.

Speaking of Dobby, he was stealing from Harry the entire time, then gambling it on the secret underground House Elf fight club. No one suspected him, not even Harry after he turned up with all the amazing "truths" about his friends betraying him.

Then they throw in Hufflepuff for some reason or another. Upon arrival at school, Harry is proclaimed Lord Hogwarts by the Hat who refuses to Sort him.

  When Harry offered himself up to Voldemort, he discovered the people in the Ministry of Death are not happy with him at all. To make up for his years of blunders, Harry is sent back in time to correct everything that went wrong and to get some revenge. Harry/6 girls, Bashing of Dumbledore, Snape, and certain Weasleys. Written for humor only. Lots of cliches. Reviews welcome.

*** You know, I never understood all this anger at the Weasleys, I mean sure, you can write a Harry that simply does not fall in love with Ginny(I normally prefer it that way), or whose personality just doesn't click with Ron and Hermione for several reasons.

It doesn't mean they must become mortal enemies. Heck, he could even be friends, you know.

I also laugh a lot when Dumbledore and Molly are just dosing everyone and their mothers with a multitude of potions for any reasons, I then normally close the fic or if it has some interesting premise or concept, just skim over those parts.

"Harry, mate, she's literally a death eater." Said Ron, freaking out over his best friend suddenly losing his mind over a girl that he didn't even know the name of until this year.

"SHUT UP, DAPHNE LOVES ME!" Screamed Harry, frothing at the mouth from love potion overdose.

"Mate, she literally spends half the time insulting you and the rest abusing muggleborns..."

"YOUR SISTER WANTS TO LOVE POTION ME AND KILL ME ON OUR WEDDING DAY!" Harry growled

"Whatever, I give up."

Three months later, the dowager lady Daphne Potter hands the entirety of the Potter Estate over to Lord Voldemort.

Because seriously, out of all the independant!Harry cliches, she's the one I have the most trouble believing. Especially since the fandom favourite is the "ice queen" persona, which, in this case, just means she constantly acts like a bitch until she suddenly, abruptly doesn't. Like a total personality transfer out of nowhere. That shit's fishier then the fics where Voldemort is suddenly a nice guy.

She was raised as a blood purist, saw the horror of the war and decided it was bullshit, married Draco and decided to raise their son Scorpio with a philosophy of tolerance, to the displeasure of Narcissa et Lucius who didn't really like her.

Daphne is never said to be a Death Eater, nor are her parents, at least as far as I've read.

Only way I read those is when the author rewrites canon in such a way that Voldemort is basically an OC and a lots of things are changing so it's not The People vs KKK and it becomes something like the "Progressives" vs "Traditionalists" where both sides are full of bias and the conflict is ideological instead of one side wanting to practice genocide.

*** There's this one which is definitely different from the usual Harry/Daphne dynamic linkffn(6245561) . I also vaguely recall a cracky one-shot whose name escapes me, but Daphne and Tracey convince Harry to marry them so they can escape death eaters, so he gives them access to his vault cause that's what nice guys do, except then they take all his gold and book it.

** Ron sighed deeply as he sat down in his house kitchen.

''you went to see him again didnt you'' hermione asked concerned.

"Nothing has changed'' ron sighed deeper tears forming in his eyes ''I just wish for a moment I would see harry, our harry, not this unstable version of him''.

''I Wish you would stop going to see him ron, it destroys you inside everytime'' hermione replied

''its our harry, I cant betray him like that, he needs me'' ron snapped with a hint of anger and agression.

Hermione pulled ron into a hug 'its not a betrayal, its been five years since we managed to get him into saint mungo's and he is not improving, I wish we noticed earlier, he was acting strange in our fifth year I assumed it was because of cedric and figured he would need some time to heal, but then sirius died at the ministry and he just slowly got worse and worse'' hermione looked at Ron '' the last time I went to see him was shortly after hugo was born, he was so disgusted with hugo and convinced you where drugging me with a love potion, it hurt me ron, it hurt me so badly to see harry looking at hugo with such hate and disgust''.

''you never told me that, you just said it was too tough and you could not go anymore'' ron replied. "I was so mad at you for that, I am sorry''

hermione smiled '' your passion is why I am so in love with you stupid and I kept it from you, I am not sure why I guess it was because you where so busy with your auror work and I felt you did not need the extra stress''. ''I almost wish harry would have died against voldemort, it would be kinder then this.'' hermione continued.

''he recovered for a few years after we defeated voldemort, I was so happy my friend was back, he married my sister had a few kids, we where aurors together solving crime, it was so great' ron smiled softly

''I hope one day he will recover again, so James,lilly and albus get to actually meet their father''

** The explanation for how all of this occurs: Harry somehow reads one of the more outlandishly badly written and trope-heavy "everyone and the kitchen sink betrays Harry" fanfics; think a cracky version of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12324284/1/A-Dramatic-Reading][A Dramatic Reading]] / [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12473842/1/A-Sensational-Story][A Sensational Story]] where instead of the canon books it's said unspecified tropey fanfic, and Harry's the one who finds it and possibly in an earlier year, I'm thinking 2nd (cause people are freaking out about him) or 4th (cause he's already being betrayed) for extra zaniness (not to mention younger can mean more gullible, plus he should get the fic before it starts so it reads like a prophecy).

Whether anyone else ever reads said fanfic can go either way.

** Wow, people really get mad at badly written fics, jeez, man, it's just people making wish fulfillment, it makes me laugh too sometimes, but I just close the fic.

Betrayal fics are a thing because people don't want to put the work in for emotional drift or other, more realistic events that make people drift apart. So they make the character's friends betray them so they can get revenge.

Or people just don't like the characters and want to make them bad.
