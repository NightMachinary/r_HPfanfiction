I'd rather no Harem, but beggars can't be choosers...


** The trick with most Susan/Harry fics is that Susan ends up as a conduit to her Aunt Amelia, who proceeds to go on a roaring rampage of revenge on young Harry's behalf - bashing is inevitable, when that happens. Apart from the excellent Final Protocol, most recent Susan/Harry stuff fits that category, unfortunately.

linkffn(12805587) Harry Potter and the Old Friend is an example from Sinyk, posted earlier this year, though it frontloads most of its bashing in its premise. Still, close to 5k favorites on ffn, so maybe?

Normally, I'd suggest linkffn(13037101) The Solution of Immortality, as I like the Susan/Harry interaction (and a Harry in Hufflepuff), but the machinations and bashing does tend toward the outlandish. Also, Ginny moved into Ron's year just makes it sillier.

  An AU first year story where Harry meets Susan at Madam Malkins Robe Shop instead of Draco. How will this affect plans Dumbledore set in motion for Harry? Will Harry get a loving and caring family for once? Read on to find out. Rated 'M' just in case. No copyright intended.

*** Yeah, its really rare to have a Harry/Susan without bashing or being a gateway to Amelia. Only 6th year fics don't have that... Oh, there's one by James Spookie that has Amelia, but she doesn't go on a vengeful spree on behalf of Hary. Forgotten Contract or something like that.

I'd rather not read anything from Sinyk, everything I've read from him I hated.

I tried Solution for about 3 chapters and then wanted to blow my head off.

Thanks though.

**** Yeah, kinda figured they'd be misses. There are a lot of bad tropes out there with Susan/Harry. In my current WiP, I have a JamesLived!Harry who basically grew up with Susan (and Amelia, his godmother), and am trying very hard to avoid those sorts of pitfalls. It's hard! So many of the early dilemmas could be solved with an owl to Aunt Amelia. Even when I play her off with a shake of the head and a muttered "I'm too old for this shit", it's still unbelievable that she would not at least look into some of this.

Hope someone comes up with a match, as I'd be curious to read that story as well.

Stay away from this novel. You get little to no character interaction. Its mostly just a narrative of just being told what is happening. The story is mostly about Amelia Bones and how she changes the wizarding world because she holds all the cards and is super amazing and is like totally awesome with futuristic knowledge from ghosts... Little to no Harry x Susan interaction. Get used to harry only saying 'Brill!" or "Brilliant!" Hope you also like major bashing.

I'm asking for opinions on such fics, so I can know if I'd enjoy it or not, because summary isn't always a good representative of most fics.

And I did read both of those, from the dude of Delenda Est (there's one called Parallel protocol that Susan is replaced by Romilda Vane.)

** I've recently read The Rose Paradox by bayushi which is a Harem story and one of the girls is Susan Bones. The relationship Harry shares with each girl feels unique compared to each other. This story has little to no bashing as I've come to think it means.

The characters are great but what I really love about the story is Harry Potter. I know, it's a Harry Potter fanfiction so I'm supposed to. Well, what I like about this Harry Potter is that he still reads like Harry Potter. He's more powerful than in the books, I think, but he's not bitter/sarcastic/evil/dark/grey. He's still good/humble/compassionate/loving/protective/funny/badass.

The females in the story are interesting in a lot of ways. Susan is just as unique and interesting as the rest. Since it's 2 different AUs in one story the events differ quite a bit from the original.

The story can be found on Fanfiction or Archive of Our Own but AO3 has pictures since the writer is more of an artist. They also started on part 2 of the series called The Paradox Coven. There are grammar issues but hopefully you can look past them.

**** I usually stop reading when characters such as Hermione or Ginny get out of character or bashed but the Hermione in the story feels different to both of those concepts since she is from a vastly different past and universe. There are many reasons given for the vastly different Hermione. Sirius is evil in the universe but I don't consider him out of character since so many things can change a person. I would consider Amelia Bones out of character simply because not many reasons are given for her different personality.
