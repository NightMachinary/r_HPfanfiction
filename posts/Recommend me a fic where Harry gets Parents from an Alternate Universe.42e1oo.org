I've read a bunch fics where Harry crosses over to another dimension/universe and meets his parents. I remember one where he gets trapped there but in this AU he died when he is 1 but his parents survived so they sort of become a family in this AU.

So I was looking for a fic where canon or close to canon Harry travels purposely or by accident to an AU to meet a version of his Parents who lost their Harry and he brings them back to his universe. If this exists I would love to read a story like this story! If not maybe I'll have to write one like that sometime. If all else fails I'd also love recommendations for your favorite dimension travel stories. Thanks!


** *Stages of Hope*, linkffn(6892925), comes closest to your requirements. [[/spoiler][However, Lily married Remus Lupin in the other dimension, and she became infertile due to an injury. James Potter remained an insufferable git. At the end of the story, Voldermorts in both dimensions were destroyed, and Harry, Hermione, Neville, and Luna joined Lily in the new dimension]]

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

** linkffn(2477819)

It's an old story, and it feels old sometimes. However, I think it's aged well enough to still be a quality story.
