** There's only 20 Harry/Fleur stories over 100k that are complete... really doesn't take that much time to just do a search on FFN rather than post a generic search like this, especially since this topic comes up pretty much daily.

*** Just checked it myself and I found one over 100k and complete. Granted I excluded any non English stories but still... 1 < > 20. [[http://i.imgur.com/ZXnoBq6.jpg][screenshot]]

****** Yeah, sadly the pairing box is next to useless because so many authors fail to use it.

** Search function, OP. Harry/Daphne is requested almost daily and there are so few completed Harry/Fleur fics they are fairly easy to find via FFN's search function.
