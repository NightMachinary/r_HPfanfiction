Hey,

I'm ISO a fic I read a long time ago.

What I remember:

- Dramione 8th year

- Magical 'fault' lines in Hermione's Diagon Alley flat - possibly above a bookshop?

- Harry is still a Horcrux

- DADA teacher turns class into a counseling session of sorts. The whole class become like a support group.

- Deals with PTSD a lot

- Fairly dark story line

- A lot of students end up back at Hermione's flat while she recovers from something

Any suggestions most welcome!

Thanks!
