And of course, it's all Potters fault.

Just imagine him waking up and Harry's like, “Merlin I was so worried, Dragon.” And he leans down to kiss him; Draco -being the dramatic king that he is- falls of the bed to avoid him.

It can be Angsty, or funny. Honestly, if no one writes this I'm going to.

Bonus points for Possessive!Harry.

Edit: I have officially started writing this fic: I will post the link once the chapter is out.

  Draco has woken up in an alternate universe. Or he has woken up utterly insane. Nothing else can possibly explain why Harry Potter suddenly seems to think he's Draco's boyfriend.

** Draco getting hit by a bludger and waking up to a changed life: check out Draco in Darkness by Plumeria linkffn(1234760)

I second the rec for "A Slytherin in Gryffindor Clothing".

There was also a similar abandoned story by IIRC jennavere involving time travel, +but this one was on skyehawke only AFAIK and vanished when skyehawke died a few months ago.+ (EDIT: It is "Vertigo", [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=12281]] )

For something similar involving Harry, check out Turn by Saras_Girl
