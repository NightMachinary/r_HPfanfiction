** A Cadmean Victory. I enjoyed it thoroughly, but it's too long and plodding for a re-read. Also perhaps more shamefully, Heart and Soul.

*** Agree with you on A Cadmean Victory. Even thinking of re-reading that is exhausting.

** A Debt of Time for sure. I liked it, but what kept me reading was finding out what happened to Mia/Hermione when she went back to the future. Now that I know, I think it might be a slog.

*** I actually started rereading it almost immediately after finishing it - going back and seeing all the foreshadowing is honestly quite brilliant. I think I made it about halfway and had to put it down to read some other things because it was too much but I'll go back and finish it sooner or later.

**** That makes sense that Part I where they search for the horcruxes together would be full of cool foreshadowing. Haha maybe you have convinced me of a reread - at least of part I.

** Firebird Trilogy

That thing was a fun ride, but I'm not paying for it again with my time.

** Backwards with purpose. It was my first ever read fanfiction I think, and I look fondly on it,but I don't think I could deal with the Weasley scenes about Harry and Ginny.

** Too young to die. I loved the writing style, but it put me in a very dark place.

*** For me Too Young To Die was kinda spaced out wrong. You get Harry kinda doing his thing until he goes to the portal. Then the time travel fucks everything up and I thought the end was abrupt but pretty good. I'll always re-read that last chapter though with Harry's Trial.

** Renegade Cause. Liked the story and followed it as it was updated chapter by chapter from the beginning, but all the characters themselves are thoroughly unlikable.

** Starfall by Lomonaaeren. It was a great story, but the beginning just ripped my heart out. I would recommend anyone with fertility issues avoid it.
