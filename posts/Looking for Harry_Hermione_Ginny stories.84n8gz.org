Are there any decent stories with that pairing where the girls are not just armcandy but actually characters with goals and ambitions? A triad would be ideal but I'll take both girls only being attracted to Harry as long as they get along. Preferably with Ginny being more than just the stereotypical "sports" girls and Hermione more than the fanon "bookworm saint".


** Would Harry/Hermione/Ginny be Harmoninny? Like a mashup of Harmony and Hinny?

*** Flaming Pie. Harry's Flying Library. Fireproof booklovers. Ginger Cake.

Most likely Gin-Harmony.

*** Given that Harry/Luna/Hermione is "Lunar Harmony" and Harry/Luna/Ginny is "Lunar Hinny", I think that maybe the proper term for this would be "Harmonic Hinny".

#+begin_quote
  A grieving Harry Potter returns for his final year at Hogwarts after defeating Voldemort and finds himself caught between two emerging factions: pureblood tradition versus muggleborn ideology. Starts out angsty and is dark at times, but overall a hopeful story. AU after the Battle of Hogwarts begins. Eventual Harry/Ginny/Hermione.

*** I've read the first one and while definitely not bad, the second chapter was all over the place. I'll give The Accidental bond a try next. Thanks for the recommendations nonetheless.
