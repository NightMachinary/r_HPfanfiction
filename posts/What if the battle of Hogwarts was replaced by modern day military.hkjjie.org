The Battle of Hogwarts is the most iconic battle not for the sparkling effects of spells flying all over the place, but for the battle of who was right and who was wrong a battle of ideologies of the wizarding world, but what if instead of death eaters, trolls and spider but what if somehow Voldemort brought in High Tech Reinforced Death Eaters equipped with magical armor like kevlar, magic enchanted bullets, M1 Abrams tanks, Apache attack helicopters and M109A7 self-propelled howitzers, would Hogwarts withstand and fight off the attack or would it fall faster?


** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] should give you an idea how this battle could be fought with modern weapons. A significant difference to canon is that this Trio has planned the battle out in advance and that these kids are very effective killers.

*** All you really need to turn the battle into a proper slaughter would be one well-used mandrake (basically a WMD).

** Odd weaponry choices given the British nature of Harry Potter.

Feels oddly reminiscent of the classic American armchair warrior.

** If the defenders use them, well, 1870s gear would win the day easily (breech-loading rifles). Voldemort ordered a frontal assault against a fortified hilltop across a few hundred yards of open ground. You don't need a Paladin to deal with that, a few horse-drawn field guns (~3-4 inches) would be more than enough. A handful of machine guns would end Voldemort's charge in a minute or two. Mustard gas or green-cross would be equally devastating (nevermind Sarin).

If Muggles use them, the Imperius curse renders all those fancy gadgets pointless. Apparation denies any battle. Invisibility magic makes ambushes ridiculously easy. Unless they have a warded stronghold which Voldemort wants. In which case, they win easily.

Remember, House elves and centaurs turned the battle armed like a medieval peasant mob. You don't need 21st-century tech to match that.
