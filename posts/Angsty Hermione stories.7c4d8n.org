Hi!

I'm searching for long completed/frequently updated angsty femslash stories where Hermione is the leading character. Preferably M rated because of smut/gore/language, because why not.

Anyone sitting on something like this? Other extraordinary things are great too!

Thanks! :)


** Closest I can think of is linkffn(Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation by Vera Rozalsky). It's a postwar fic with Hermione taking some daring choices in order to sort out her war-battered brain. She's attracted to men more than women, but there are some saucy parts where she grieves over (and tries to re-enact) some missed chances with Tonks.

Eh... maybe not so close.

There's also the quintessential Hermione/Luna fic linkffn(Crazy Little Things by dreiser). Also post-war, Luna has to draw Hermione out of her traditionalist shell in several ways.

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

  The Semiclassic 'everyone has been lying to Harry about everything' plot. Very AU. Bashing of pretty much everyone. Mind Control Sex. Language. Dumbledore decides the Old Families won't tolerate the Chosen One being with a mudblood. Sucks to be Ron Ginny
