I thought it'd be a cool idea. Does anyone know any good ones that aren't dark, AU or full of bashing? I'd like the characters to stay mostly in character.


** Not exactly what you're asking for because it is HP, RW, GW but it is a fantastically well written story that fits your other requirements if you want to check it out

  Time Travel. It's the end of the Battle of Hogwarts but the price has been high. The Golden Trio dearly wished that they could have done more to save lives and fate decides to grant their wish. Follow them as they redo their years at Hogwarts, starting from First year and work to make a difference in the wizarding world. All while trying to keep their true selves a secret.

  Rose is just born and Al is due. But after finding an ancient mirror, Harry, Ron, Hermione and baby Rose are sent back into their 11-year-old bodies the night before they first met. Trapped in the past and wary of the Wizarding World, they seek to kill Voldemort as soon as possible. Together Harry, Ron and Hermione shall show the past who the Golden Trio really are.

I thought I found one of /The Infinite Loops/ , but it turns out it's not. The title is a lie. But it gave me some good laughs though.
