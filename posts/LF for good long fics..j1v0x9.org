LF fics which are atleast 50K words, a more serious storyline, where Harry is not the heir of every other house, and is the most powerful wizard and stuff. Where Harry is good, but not on par with Dumbledore and Voldemort. Fic with NO Dumbledore bashing.

Thanks.

** Had I Known » After killing Voldemort during seventh year, Harry vanished without a trace. But now, 8 years later, a deadly secret forces him to return and it seems that only Snape will be able to save him. SSHP, no slash İt looks like he has a lot of power but due to some mysterious circumstances he is left with chronic pain fatigue which he tries to hide. So I don't think it's an op story but rather a story of dealing with ptsd and trauma. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2544950/1/Had-I-Known]]
