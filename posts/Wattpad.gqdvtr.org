I've noticed that some people on this subreddit speak of Wattpad as if it's the worst site to read HP fanfiction on. Why? What's so bad about it?

*** Ah, I've noticed the format thing too, especially on the app (yes, I did download it, just in case). And it's annoying when you search for HP fics but get search results from totally different fandoms, with no relevance to your search whatsoever.

** If I find a fic worth reading thats only posted on Wattpad, I read there. But that hasn't happened yet in the past 19 years of reading fanfiction. And that's the problem, there is objectively no reason to read on wattpad. The quality of fics just isn't there.

If I am wrong and there are actually good authors that post only there, pls point them out. I am always open to find some new fics to read.

** Unreadable layout, but mostly? Wattpad is a business that's worth about $400 million dollars. They profit off of fanfiction.

That is one of the biggest, oldest rules of fanfiction: you don't fucking make any money off of other people's properties. Fanfiction already skirts a grey legal line that we've been fighting about for decades, and Wattpad just throws their middle finger up at everything that's been fought for. 

They're eventually going to get into seriously deep shit for what they're doing. Might not happen tomorrow, but it's gonna happen.

** It's the worst site to read any fanfiction on. The archive is horribly difficult to navigate. I've never successfully found a good fic in /any/ fandom. HP is just not anything special that suddenly makes Wattpad good.

I should note that for context, when I say that Wattpad is the worst site to read any fanfiction on I am not useing hyperbole. I have been reading fanfiction for over 15 years. In that time I have used a ton of different sites. Some which are great, some which are not. Wattpad is the absolute worst site I have seen.

** The short answer is that I haven't found any fanfic worth reading to me on that website.

When it comes up in google searches, it's always worse quality than the average FFN/AO3/HPFFA/... result.

** - hard to read

- website is overflowing with trash (I cannot call it otherwise) written by teenagers for teenagers: just open the website and look at the first thing advertised there, in 9 out of 10 cases (to be generous) it is something like “When Katelyn is forced to travel the US with her pop star brother and leave her soccer dream behind, she is furious - until she meets singer Zach Matthews...”

- having said that, there are few things I like:

  - [[https://www.wattpad.com/story/12122491][Dursley's Daughter (A Harry Potter Next Generation Fan Fic)]]
  - [[https://www.wattpad.com/story/51279347][Dursley's Dilemma (Sequel to Dursley's Daughter)]]
  - [[https://www.wattpad.com/story/119685004][Moving On]]
  - [[https://www.wattpad.com/story/38992524][Redemption (Dudley Dursley)]]
  - [[https://www.wattpad.com/story/1963063][The Peculiar Resilience of the Refugee _ Harry Potter for Grown-Ups]]
  - [[https://www.wattpad.com/story/142261988][Everything Wrong With HARRY POTTER Fanfictions]]
  - [[https://www.wattpad.com/story/216336619][FALLEN PRINCE _ Prisoner of Azkaban]]

  Particularly “Everything Wrong ...” is really good and a bit unique theoretical review and commentary of fanfiction stories. “Dursley's ...” are fluffy high-school stories without much drama, but not worse than your average afternoon TV series.

** Den. Of. Thieves.

I have an account there just so I can report people and I go on every month and have to painstakingly search my own name and the names of my 200+ fics. I often fill out detailed reports, wait a day, and then leave a review on the plagiarized fic about how I don't want my fics on that site and by having my own account I could at any time post them myself, so if I haven't, there must be a reason for that. How consent is a word not just associated with sex and how they need to learn the definition immediately. Some people immediately take the story down after that.

My one Harrymort fic, has been posted there 9 times without my permission. Twice by the same person a year apart because they thought I wouldn't know or something? Usually there's some kind of half-assed comment in their AN about how 'if you're the author and don't want this here just tell me' or a small note at the bottom of their profile stating they aren't the original writer, yet in the fics themselves they're accepting praise in the reviews for their 'great writing' and not telling people the truth.

And all of them are guilty of copying other works too and I AM the jerk who will PM each and every writer whose work has also been plagiarized, and make sure they each go after the Wattpad thieves.

A 15 y/o decided to spend her whole 2019 Christmas vacation copying one of my fics without my permission, changing the ship and ending, and then got mouthy with me over me reporting her for it. IDC that she was 15 and 'just expressing herself' she was a [very unflattering four-letter expletive] and deserved all of her 'hard work' to go down the drain.

** It's just really hard to find good fit's on Wattpad. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure that there are hundreds of amazing ff's that have been posted, but it's just really hard to navigate on the website/app.

Personally, I feel that Wattpad is really good for writing your own stories, just not fan fiction unless you really know exactly what you are looking for and how to look for it...

As somebody who reads ff's on Wattpad as well, I recommend clicking on the author of that one really good book and chances are that that author has followed an equally exceptional author or has reading lists about their favourite fan fictions. To find good hp ff's, I literally just read books on other people's reading lists...

I hope this helps!

P.S: If you want to read HP ff's on Wattpad, check out KMbell92. Her fan fictions are extremely well written and I throughly enjoy each and every one of them...

*** YES! KMbell92 is one of the best authors on Wattpad. And I agree with everything you said, once you find that one good author, just read all their stuff and find new stuff from they reading lists.

** I started out on wattpad and only used it for 6 months or so. There are a few good fics on there, but I keep finding the same fics on ffn or au3. If your looking for small cute fics, i would say that wattpad is alright, but otherwise it's not very good.

** There is a lot of poorly written fics on there, but there sometimes there are goldmines I also see lots of reposting on there.

Adds as well.

I have the app on my phone, for no reason other than to have it, and it updates CONSTANTLY. It can get so annoying. I actually first started reading stories and fan fiction in general with Wattpad, but I didn't read much ff that I actually liked. I mostly read original stories that weren't for any fandom.

Their whole system of just finding a fanfic to read is horrible. I got use to the original format, and guess what? They changed the entire archives system.

I just personal don't like the app because it's hard to use, barely any fanficiton that isn't old troups(dark Harry, baby au's, and many other thing that I don't want to think about before bed) that are written badly.

It also doesn't help that the app is raided by tweens and teens that have horrible taste humor (but again SOMETIMES there are gems). you can find lots of textfics i know, but if you aren't looking for bad overused troups, bnha textfics, or BTS fan fiction, you aren't going to find anything worth your time.

Here are some fanfics that I have actually enjoyed on this site...

[[https://my.w.tt/edhhRqKkN6][Severus Snape: The Half Blood Prince]]

Though now that I think about this did, I kinda hated it... it goes off the 'this is a fic I can understand with good plot' to 'what the Hell is happening' half way through.

[[https://my.w.tt/l1q7810kN6][Of Shadow, Shine, and Shades]]

Um... it can be confusing, but it's okay...

[[https://my.w.tt/RIn2yL7kN6][Celestial Soul | Tom Riddle]]

You might find a trend of Tom Riddle stories I read...

[[https://my.w.tt/N8N1a7ilN6][Hicearcy of Need [t.r]]]

You might be able to tell I'm a girl by now.

[[https://my.w.tt/Mg1C6GslN6][To a Unsolicited Mind [t.r]]]

Short and cute.

Okay, I'm going back to bed now. Sorry if none of that makes sense, it's 4am right now, and I'm very tired. Thank goodness I'm not doing anything tomorrow.

Um I just realize I have crap taste, bye

** Its hard to find good fics. Most are just weird and have bad grammar. The good ones are great though, and some of those good authors have 40+ works so its great to read through all of them. The only way to find anything worth reading is to look at the reading lists of the good authors, chances are the books they like are also good. Searching the tags is honestly no use, a lot of the top ones are really terrible for some weird reason Wattpad has some really good original work too, so thats the good part. It's really hard to find though. :/

A good hp fanfic writer is KMbell92, but her stories are all AUs (there are a few so don't get confused), and not really complete. She has enough books and chapters in one book to last a long time though. A original series is Anonymous by DumDumPops4, a series of fairytale remixes (they don't seem entirely related at first but they are good).

Ok I have come to the conclusion that the only good fanfics on Wattpad are AUs because they are actually written by writers that are good and put effort to write and finish. Also, originals aren't too bad on Wattpad, some are probably better than some actual books out there.
