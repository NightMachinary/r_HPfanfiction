** I'd love to see one of those non-sexual harem fics except that it's Hermione accidentally acquiring wizards and she has absolutely no idea what to do about it while also being horrified that it's a thing. Meanwhile all the Wizards she acquired gel pretty well together and end up going on missions together in support of Harry...

** I'm working on a Harry Potter and Wrestling crossover...(or a few of them).

It's called: The Black Twins.

Harry and Hermione are twins and join WWE.

Hermione is married to Draco and Harry is dating a female superstar (not sure which one yet) it begins by settling up a triple tag team match for Survivor Series (Raw vs Smackdown vs NXT) New Day are the Raw Tag Champs. The Club (Styles and Finn) are Smackdown Tag Champs while Harry and Hermione are NXT Tag Champs.

** I've got a few-

One where Andromeda and Ted Tonks are more involved in the war/series. Andromeda helping Sirius get a trial since he's her cousin or one of them teaching at Hogwarts ect.

The twins are closer to the trio and more involved in their adventures.

Harry Hermione and Ron have more friends in other houses and the houses are more united

James and Lily come back to life during one of the books and help with the fight against voldemort/take Harry in

Harry is found by the Lovegoods and raised with Luna

** There is an overwhelming number of nations, species, organizations and individuals in the HP canon universe that are just... there. We know little to nothing about them because they never had any relevance to the story of Harry Potter. So the vast majority of prompt ideas I can come up with can be summed up under the umbrella of “Literally Anything But The Story Of Harry Potter, And Anywhere But Britain.”
