were they created by long forgotten wizards or did ambient magic mutate plants to become what they are. if so what else can be affected by exposure to ambient magic, are there places with magic so dense it changes the terrain entirely and giving it some kind of magical effect? In many other pieces of fiction, there are lakes of liquid fire, cloud castles made out of discarded dreams, forests with pools of water that can help travel between worlds. Do you think any place like that exists in the WW? If Merlin exists in canon then would Avalon on another plane of existence?

its established that wizards can create magical creatures through breeding and experimentation, does that include all magical creatures or just some? if they were created does that mean wizards long gone could impart magic or enchant bloodlines to keep they animals magical, is that where parseltongue came from, enchanted bloodlines? if animals were imparted magic and if evolution holds true in the wizarding world, weren't they animals to begin with as well? does that mean humans were given magic by a higher being?

i wonder how the first human with magic figured it out, if ambient magic mutated humans capable to wield it, what do you think that would be like?


** I believe in some fanon Hogwarts is a place like what you have described, the ambient magic from the generations of young witches and wizards has granted the place magic of its own along with the forbidden forest which is heavily magical, however, I believe that some magical creatures are products(manticores, chimera) but the majority are natural (see dragons, the giant squid in the lake) Moreover if the theme of saying all magical history is in fact real then it wouldn't be too far off to say magic would've assisted in the conception of some magical beings such as centaurs from the obvious two beings via “the power of love” or for fae and fairies to exist in the magical world also, what with Morgiana and the Arthurian tales there being as they are, which may explain other magical beings with some intelligence like the goblins, Merfolk(though they may also have been a product of beastiality), those little twig creatures from fantastic beasts, and pixies

** I think it is a mixture. There are many species that evolved naturally to bear magical abilities, but there are also many species that were once artificial, created by wizards so long ago that nobody even remembers that there was a time they did not exist. Creatures like centaurs and mermaids being major examples, that could not possibly have occurred naturally from existing fauna.

In the HP universe, mankind has been putzing around with magical powers for, conservatively, at least five thousand years. I envision a world absolutely saturated with weird and wonderful oddities tucked away behind near every available corner, just barely out of sight of our muggle existence.

For example, in my current fic there's often oblique references to regions of the world where magical travel just isn't an option. Generally this is just an excuse to interject dialogue time during travel, which otherwise should be instantaneous by magical means, but this makes for a useful in-universe explanation.

Nobody really questions most of these instances, it is simply assumed that /someone,/ at /some/ stage or another, flung up a bunch of enchantments that they never got around to writing about or explaining to anyone.

** In linkffn(for the love of magic by NoddleHarmer) it is shown as a consequence of magic in the ambient, don't think there is a cannon explanation.
