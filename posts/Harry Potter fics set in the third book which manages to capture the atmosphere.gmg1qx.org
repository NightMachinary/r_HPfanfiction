The Third Book was the closest Harry Potter got to a proper boarding school novel book. Are there any fics set in the third book. I don't want it to be a sequel of sorts but simply starting from the third book.


** There's a popular one by Marauder called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2156084/1/Another_Prisoner_Another_Professor][/Another Prisoner, Another Professor/]], which swaps Sirius Black and Remus Lupin's role in the story, and changing the plot appropriately.

I've never read it myself but I've heard it said that the fanfic author managed to capture Rowling's style well.

** For me, linkffn(The Strange Disappearance Of Sally-Anne Perks) is a story that has the slightly dark and /off/ feel with the world in the third book, as well as being a great mystery to boot. I regularly recommend it and would suggest that, if you read 8t, you go in totally blind. It's really good and is slightly unnerving, kind of like parts of the third book. Set in third year, based on context from things the writer says.

  Harry recalls that a pale little girl called Sally-Anne was sorted into Hufflepuff during his first year, but no one else remembers her. Was there really a Sally-Anne? Harry and Hermione set out to solve the chilling mystery of the lost Hogwarts student.
