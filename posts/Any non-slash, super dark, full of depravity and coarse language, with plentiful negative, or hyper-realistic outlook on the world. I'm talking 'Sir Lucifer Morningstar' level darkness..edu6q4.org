**** That would be the darkest, most twisted dystopian world I have had the (dis?)pleasure of reading. I loved it!

Many of its themes are extremely controversial, which is why you'll see many people disagreeing about it. Like it or not, it's extremely well written.

(Just had an argument about this fic not long ago, so:) I think that all these themes make sense within the world-building, but I'll list the warnings anyway.

Misogyny, misandry, harems, kids that have to be too sexual too early, many phallic themes.

Apparently I can't link it, so (all on ffn):

***** I'm pretty sure your not allowed to leave a link to the Firebird trilogy bc of the underage stuff. I would recommend deleting the link just in case. Although I do agree with you about the fic. It's a really interesting series and the worldbuilding done on top of JKR's is impressive.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

**** Thank you very much! Try searching for "Sir lucifer morningstar" in ffn.com He wrote some good novels, one on Naruto, another on DC, both of them are really good for reading when you are tired of sob stories and mercifful mc's... In the DC one, mc literraly steals pantie's and says, "Remember this day, that [bad guy name] stole your panties. Remember it, and despair." And then walks off.

** You made me remember a dead story (I think) about a SI as Draco,it seemed like crack at the begginning with the MC having Dobby raid weed dealers and using that weed to rapidly improve in learning magic, even making hermione smoke it for some reason but things went tits up when Voldemort found out, forcing the MC to smoke with him (hilariously creepy lol), got very edgy very fast.

PM or whatever if you know the story pls!
