Looking for a fic where Hermione turns out to be adopted and ends up that she is actually from a pure blood family. Thanks


** Off the top of my head I would say Linkffn(Presque Toujours Pur) and linkffn(The Muddy Princess) are both really good.

Oh and while strictly speaking Hermione wasn't adopted in linkffn(One Step Forward, Two Decades Back) I think the premise might be interesting to you.

Edit- the bot only linked the first one

*** Seconding Presque Toujours Pur. The author did a great job weaving in the possibility of her being a pureblood into cannon. I was blown away. The ending was just fantastic.

Muddy Princess and anything Columbrina does is very well done too.

**** Thirding PTP. It's a Dramione classic as well as a pureblood!Hermione classic (my fave genre). One of the best written Hermione is a Black stories- which tend to be my least favorite in the genre (much prefer the Nott ones).

  AU/AO: [HG/SS] What-if Story. Hermione Granger gets erased due to a badly phrased, vague, and bitter wish. She is Hermione Granger no more. Now, thanks to Ron, she is Hermione Ankaa Black, sister of Sirius and Regulus Black, and member of the Noble and Most House of Black. Now what is she going to do? Multiple pairings in later chapters, and JP starts out as a rampaging jerk.

  Just another Pureblood!Hermione story. A hidden adoption revealed, a brother found, a new world to figure out: "What are you hoping for?" he asked as they stood ready to do the spell. "I don't know," Hermione admitted. "You?" His knuckles were white on his wand. "A sister," he said, his voice very low, "I'm hoping for a sister." Winner 2015 Energize WIP Awards. COMPLETE.

** Recommending it is a minor spoiler, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3682339/1/The-Golden-Age][The Golden Age]] has this as a major plot point.

It's post-war, and the story is fairly dark and has a lot of realpolitik. YMMV.

** Can't remember the name, but it was a Hermione/Snape fic( or two) where Hermione and family were the magical Royal family still in hiding from Voldemort, whom they still suspected of not dying.

*** If this is the fic I recall, the Grangers real surname was Kensington. This was a two story arc and there was a lot of drinking / nightclubs involved. Snape went under the name of Snake I think. And I've been looking for this fic for ages to re-read!! Never been able to track it down though.
