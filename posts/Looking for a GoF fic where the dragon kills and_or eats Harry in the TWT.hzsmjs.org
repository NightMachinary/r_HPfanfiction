Are there any fics out there like this where the Diabolical Masterminds behind the Triwizard Tournament grossly underestimate Harry's competence and he just gets Nom nommed by the Hungarian horntail?

Bonus points if it's crack where Crouch junior is standing in front of the Dark Lord with his hat in his hand trying to explain how his Flawless plan went off the rails so fast

Or maybe Neville wasn't aware of the plan and he's like oh Harry's Firebolt I should put this away so it doesn't get lost and what is this window doing open


** Ok, so. Um. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/896895][The Cupboard Series]] has this in the fic entitled 'The Fourth School'. Sort of. Technically. Well, you'd just have to read it.

It's quite obviously in fourth year, so you'll have to read a fair bit to get there, however. It is NOT a short series. linkao3(13054572)

  A mysterious green inked letter banished Harry from his cupboard. But does taking the boy out of the cupboard also mean that you've taken the cupboard out of the boy? A first year fic. Book 1 of The Cupboard Series

**** I'm putting it here so it's easier to skip over if you plan on reading the like 400k words required to get there. So. Spoilers ahoy!

Harry gets expelled, la de da, and eventually starts his own school. Swipes McGonagall as the headmistress and most of the better students from Hogwarts. Much drama about things. Fourth year happens, and his name comes out of the goblet. Well. The goblet is attached to magical signatures, not the name, and therefore crouch entered himself.

So Crouch is now faced with loosing his magic if he doesn't compete, so he does. He also does it under polyjuice and is therefore Harry. He does the broom thing, fails spectacularly, and frees the dragon right before he gets murdered. Aaaand the dragon goes on a rampage, destroying the stands of the quiddich pitch and killing/injuring most of the people watching the task. Harry's school had declined the invitation to watch, and therefore he wasn't even there. So yeah - kind of sort of what you're asking for but not quite.

****** I didn't read the whole thing but I went and found and read the chapter that you mentioned. It was about what I was expecting out of a rampaging dragon and I especially liked Crouch's little fuck you at the end there.

Hogwarts School of Negligence and Child Endangerment.

** I don't see how you're gonna find a story with this premise for a few reasons. 1. If it's part of a series, and he got entered, that means he's probably the MC of the series with a lot of time put into him. So that's a no-go. 2. If he's the MC period, this'll either end up as a reincarnation story, or won't happen at all. 3. It's just not good story telling. He's the lynchpin of the entire series, Voldemorts destined rival. So you'd have to change the story a lot for it to just make sense. I mean a good story has a story-line, plot, character development, etc...

This could only really work as either a one-shot cracky story, or in a story where it's been changed so much that it's not even the same story anymore. My advice. Write the one-shot yourself, or pay an author(which is possible on here) something like $50-$100 for a nice 2,500-5000 word one-shot.

*** There are 800k fanfics on ffn alone. This sub answers promts regularly. You yourself said it's doable in an one-shot.

It also would be a perfect time for divergence (make Hermione / Draco / Dumbledore / ... the protagonist).

There are so many ways and reasons this could exist, and I don't see the point of shitting on a perfectly valid request like this. It honestly makes you look a bit like an ass.

**** But I didn't, or at least I didn't intend for it to come across that way. The written word is not great when conveying emotion across I guess. While there may be 800k+ fics out there in this genre, there is a reason you made such a request. I was pointing out the difficulties in attempting such a story. That's all.

They didn't shit on the request, they simply presented arguments as to why the requester probably won't find those types of fics.
