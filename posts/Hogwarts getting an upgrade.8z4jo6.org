Hey y'all, I read kind of a crack fic the other day that actually had a really interesting bit on reforming Hogwarts (more teachers, grade based common rooms etc). Are there any (more serious) fics that focus on that? That's part of Canon that always bugged me, the fact that Hogwarts seems like a terribly designed system


** Also, when I read about "Hogwarts getting an upgrade", my first thought was that Hogwarts would get moats or magical catapults, or maybe a sentience upgrade. Have an old snippet of mine (a /Girl Genius/ fusion):

--------------

"Harry! Good news! You don't have to worry about the whispers in the walls anymore!" Harry Potter turned around, forcing down the feeling of dread, as he recognised the voice, and, worse yet, the inflection in the voice. The prior year and a half has taught him and his fellow Gryffindors to read the moods of their fellow Gryffindor Hermione Granger very well indeed, and her present mood was best described as "I just had another Episode, and I am looking for a +victim+ audience to show off my creation to." (Her beaming expression, and her face covered in soot with circles of cleanliness around her eyes where the goggles---presently up on her forehead---had been, only confirmed his assessment.) However, the witch had already spotted him, so it was too late to flee.

Not five minutes later, he found himself being dragged by Hurricane Granger into the girls toilets, past what looked like an unconscious form of a redheaded girl with a big lump on her head, through a hole in a the wall wedged open by a pipe, down a slide, and into what he surmised had been (at some point in the recent past) the mysterious Chamber of Secrets.

"Welcome to Hogwarts Machine Room Number Four!"

Hermione was not very good at naming things, Harry mentally noted upon learning its new name. Still, that meant that there were at least two of her "machine rooms" that he did not know about, which was worrying, though he was quite certain that he did not want to know about them either. Abandoning that train of thought, he turned his attention to the contraption in front of him as Hermione rambled excitedly.

"... the biomechanical PetriBeam generator and Universal Solvent production plant..."

The centrepiece was the gigantic harness, which held an equally gigantic snake-like creature. Its body was merely immobilised inside an articulated harness, while its head was festooned with Hermione's incomprehensible technology. (One learned all sorts of interesting new terminology, like "articulated", when one got caught in Granger's vicinity during one of her Episodes; "festooned" he had learned from Seamus Finnigan, in a completely unrelated incident.)

The creature's jaw had been wedged open by struts, and a part of Hermione's machine extended deep into its oral cavity with further piping running down its throat. Its fangs were encased in glass funnels. A large wheel rotated slowly near the roof of its mouth, operating a piston to periodically squeeze the area just above the fangs, extracting a dark liquid that ran down the funnels, through a network of glass tubes, and into a collection drum. Hermione continued her ramble as she checked the dials.

"... at this rate, it can produce up to 5 litres a day, yes,..."

The creature's eyes... could not be seen, being completely covered by another contraption, which led to a scaffolding of lenses, prisms, and mirrors.

"... The PetriBeam generator is the most useful part, however. I've already built the receiver-projector on top of the Astronomy Tower, and, once I link them up, we will be able to petrify any enemy that tries to approach the castle. Eventually, receiver-projectors can be placed on other towers and in other locations with good overview as well. This will complement the Hogwarts's defences by giving it medium-range counterattack capability."

Harry shuddered, recalling the Mandrake Sonic Projector Incident.

"... and, between the feeding tube, the articulated harness, and some electrostimulation, I can keep its muscles from atrophying, to keep it in good health. What do you think?"

The mad witch finally paused, making her way back to Harry's side and looking at him expectantly. In the brief silence, Harry was able to make out a whisper.

"K-kill... me... Merc-cy..."

"It's suffering," Harry whispered in turn, shuddering as he imagined himself similarly trapped.

"Oh, that? Don't worry, snakes aren't sapient---they can't think. It's getting fed and exercised regularly, none of the contact points actually cause pain---I made sure of that, so it's perfectly content. Just to make sure, I am planning to implant some electrodes into its pleasure centers as soon as I find a drill that can penetrate its skull."

Harry forced down the nausea at that thought and focused on the point. "This one is sapient, Hermione. It spoke to me. It's suffering, and it wants to die."

"It is? It does? But..." She stared at her creation, her expression shifting to that of horror and guilt. "Oh, no, Harry! What have I done?!" She strode over to her machine.

There was a moment when Harry was concerned that Hermione was about to release an angry giant snake that generated a "PetriBeam" (and he could guess exactly what that did, given what had happened to Mrs Norris) and a venom potent enough for Hermione to call it a "Universal Solvent" (which was saying a lot). He was even reaching for his wand to stop her, when she turned around, and that particular fear was dispelled, replaced with an arguably greater dread of another Episode.

"Foreman Dinky, break's over!"

There were pops of house-elf apparition. Hermione's elves (Local #0001, Hogwarts), already wearing those weird goggles and aprons, cheered as they rushed to the toolchest to equip themselves, while Hermione, who had somehow acquired a clipboard, began to sketch furiously while issuing orders.

Soon enough, she beamed at him. "Harry, fetch me the socket wrench Number Seventy-Six! We shall make this biomechanical PetriBeam generator and Universal Solvent production plant safe, productive, /and/ humane!"

Harry felt the now familiar wave of excitement and inspiration wash over him. Yes, of course he wanted to help Hermione with her latest masterpiece! But, it wasn't /his/ feeling, he had come to know. Others would get caught up in her excitement, but he generally found that he could keep his wits even when Hermione got like that.

He decided to go with the flow anyway. The witch meant well, after all, and /someone/ had to make sure she didn't go too far. How far was too far, however, he had no idea.

**** Not really, no. There were some thoughts about the backstory, however.

Basically, Department of Mysteries had this charity project to "uplift" Muggles and accelerate their development. This was done through prenatal interventions, imbuing some Muggles with varying amounts of technological talent and preternatural charisma. This was meant to create leaders who could both create and integrate big ideas and get others to go along to implement them. Some of their successes may have been Steve Jobs, Linus Torvalds, Elon Musk, and Craig Venter.

Naturally, the Unspeakables were strictly prohibited from experimenting on wizards and witches, so they carefully checked the ancestry of every potential intervention subject. Hermione Granger had no known magical ancestry.

At first, her intervention appeared to be a success: young Hermione was very good at designing and engineering things, and at getting other people to go along. However, in August of 1991, she suddenly went off the radar. When she resurfaced at Hogwarts shortly after, the Unspeakables were had the unenviable realisation that they had accidentally experimented on a witch and that if it came to light, they would be in huge trouble; but also an opportunity to study something that hasn't been seen before: the Muggle technocharisma uplift applied to a wizard or a witch creates a Spark.

** Hogwarts was a parody of a British boarding school. I'd also question whether (even more) grade segregation would be a good thing. Some systems, like Montessori, consider interactions across age groups to be a fundamental component.

Also, keep in mind that Hogwarts looks badly designed from the point of view of an adolescent who is not very studious or attentive, and who has a personal conflict with at least one of the teachers. Not only that, the school that we saw had been magically sabotaged by the DADA curse for decades.

****** We should always try to honor the intentions of the poster though. I think in this case the question is just phrased... not very well. I think he is looking for some kind of fix-it fic? It's pretty common in them that Hogwarts get improved somehow or replaced by a 'better' school. Though it is often not the main focus.

OP: One fic that comes to mind is "The Board":

** Ha, I've actually been roughing out a story that would have Hogwarts reforms be a large part of the background world... but I'll be honest, I don't think I'll ever actually write it, so I don't mind sharing what I had:

Basically the idea was that James Potter survived (and maybe Sirius and the Longbottoms were not incapacitated as well). He/they would form both a check on Lucious Malfoy and push Dumbledore towards being more active, although their actions wouldn't always have the intended/positive consequences. One of those would be educational reform, which Lucious actually supports (Dumbledore doesn't much), but they would clash over various issues.

Some changes I had in mind:

-more teachers or at least upper year TAs to help out. Slughorn for potions for sure.

-splitting some classes (like herbology and potions) into theory lectures for all houses of a year at once, then practical sessions for 1-2 houses at a time

-possibly some inter-House... I knew them as 'labs' when I was in uni but there's probably another name. Like these short group meetings with an upper year to ask questions or do quick review, usually in the evenings/weekend

-possibly an advanced track or remedial/applied/academic split, so students could be taught at their appropriate level

-more administrative staff, who don't teach. Maybe even House Head becomes a more ceremonial/unofficial position with a new role introduced for officially dealing with issues

-astronomy moved to a 3rd and up elective?

-Binns replaced- I had in mind it would be one of Lucious' choices, who unfortunately has a bit of a wizard supremacist bias

-two paired courses, one in first year as an introduction to wizarding society, one in fourth year perhaps about learning enough of muggle society to be able to blend in properly (Muggle Studies is much more in-depth though)

-some more clubs and activities beyond quidditch: although actually cannon hints that there were such things, since Umbridge banned them, but Harry never every paid any attention to them

-more quidditch matches per year?

But ah, hehe you probably want fics that actually exist right now, right? Unfortunately I don't have much.

There's linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12713828/1/Victoria-Potter]]) by Taure, who I think is a regular here? It's short so far but has a lot of world-building and thought put in. Like 'Flying' class is essentially gym class (not just flying, but running, archery, fencing, etc) for all the years simultaneously. There's supervised homework time, a bunch of neat character-building ideas for the House Common rooms (like... [[/spoiler][Griffindor has doors leading outside and brooms set by them, so you can go flying whenever]]). Very good.

It's not Hogwarts, but Charmbridge Academy in linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/4/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle]]) is very much set up like a large school would be. There's deans for each grade; common rooms by year; there's no Houses, just what dorm you're in; multiple academic levels for each class; various extra-curricular clubs and activities including a deuling club, a dance or two each year and a magical jrotc; multiple teachers per subject; the same sort of combined-year magic gym/flying class as mentioned before.

There's also linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7619993/1/Calculation]]), which is a one shot crack fic that deals with a bunch of this stuff. I... I feel like this may or may not be the one OP mentioned already having read but I don't know.
