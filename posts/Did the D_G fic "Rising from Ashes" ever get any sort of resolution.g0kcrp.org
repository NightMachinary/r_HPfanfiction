This is maybe a long shot, but this quarantine has gotten me rereading fic I loved long ago and I realised I had never gotten closure on this particular D/G fic--which was, by the way, amazing.

It was Rising from Ashes by Arabella and Jedi Boadicea, and it was (this totally shows my age...) uploaded to a Yahoo! Group which I don't have any access to since I forgot the password of the account I joined it with. Last I remember was I believe Year 6.

Any leads or information appreciated!
