I don't have a specific anime in mind and I'd prefer Harry to be paired with a girl from the anime and not his own books.

It doesn't matter what anime it is. If I haven't seen it then it give me something new to watch.

No slash please.

​

Thanks for your help.


** I read this as "Harry Potter and Annie crossovers" and got the strange image of HP singing it's a hardknock life...

Edit: Although all things considered, maybe Tom Riddle should sing it. Does that make Dumbledore Daddy Warbucks?

  A Harry Potter who has tried to take control of his destiny from second year on finds himself in need of a fresh start due to his marital status changing abruptly. Armed with some abilities beyond the norm, a Mastery of Defense and a muggle-style teacher's license, Harry takes his daughter Lily Luna and takes a job offer at Kuoh Academy. Pairings undecided save Harry/Rias/many?

** Harry and anime? I got you fam

I hope you don't mind RWBY being counted as an Anime - If you do then sorry.

*A Gentleman On Remnant* - linkffn(13511982 ) - RWBY Crossover: Includes the use of an older Harry, not complete but was well done so far and enjoyable to read.

*Nothing Left* - linkffn(9857558) - RWBY Crossover: Another pretty well written and enjoyable fic. Though Harry is OOC in this but I thought why was pretty well explained.

*The Next Great Adventure: Dead Man Talking* - linkffn(12946300) - RWBY Crossover: Another excellent story that I enjoyed and thought to share.

*The Return of Magic* - linkffn(12292532) - RWBY Crossover: The most favorited one according to FFN and for good reason. Its the most fleshed out of the other fics and is the one that got me into this crossover.

*For Death's Amusement* - linkffn(12710549) - RWBY Crossover: The last of my reccs from this fandom. This was another good fleshed out story.

*Sitting on a bench* - linkffn(11976393) - Highschool DxD Crossover: A short but sweet story.

*FILFY teacher* - was already linked and is probably the best story from the Harry/DxD crossovers. I strongly recommend reading that one.

*Harry and a Vampire* - linkffn(13150962) - Rosario + Vampire Crossover: There is a lot of wizarding world bashing in this story. Harry also changes throughout the story but its an anime crossover and I enjoyed so I thought I mention it.

*One Punch Wizard* - linkffn(12355543) - One Punch Man Crossover: A lighthearted fun story that is excellent and should be enjoyable.

... I know I have Naruto/Harry Potter crossover somewhere. Damn it, its late and I can't stay up anymore to look. I try to look for it when I wake up. If I don't comment again feel free to PM me.

Hope this list is to your likeing

  This fairy tale begins, as most of them often do, with a man of some importance coming to a place that he never should have been. Little did anyone know, from the Great and Powerful to the Wicked in the West, that this fairy tale wouldn't be quite what they expected. (Older Harry)

  After the defeat of Voldemort, life for Harry Potter hadn't gone as expected. The Auror life wasn't for him, and his relationship with Ginny had failed. Now, as an unofficial Curse-Breaker, a more skilled Harry has found himself on Remnant saving the life of a certain Atlas Specialist. With magic returning to the land, will Harry succeed where others have failed in combating Salem?

I thought it was pretty funny :D

edit: Feel I should add that this author has, too, a Hellsing crossover as well as a Kaze no Stigma crossover, and both are really good and completed

  The Second Task and the Graveyard played out differently. With Sirius cleared, Voldemort dead, and just wanting to get away from it all, Harry is sent away for schooling outside of England. Life in England may be a circus, but Harry is unknowingly sent to a school with a different type of insanity. Just why is the school pink?
