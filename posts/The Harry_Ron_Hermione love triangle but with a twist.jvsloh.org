Instead of Hermione being torn between Harry and Ron, Ron and Hermione are fighting for Harry's affection. When the time comes to choose, Harry chooses Ron, and Hermione bows out as gracefully as she can manage. It was no less than she expected really, but she had to try. She would regret it too much if she didn't. They try to keep their friendship up with her, but in the end, she was hurting too much and had to leave eventually.

(No bashing please - they are all good people and good friends).


** If any of you even have Harry and Hermione fighting over Ron, I'd read it.

*** Hmm... I've actually seen that one happen. Not much for the rearranging roles in the love triangle thing though ðŸ˜…

**** I remember one where both Harry and Hermione are more interested in Ron (but do end up all together). Not the name, unfortunately, just that it's a series of mostly-one-shots on AO3 and starts with Ron and Hermione about to get married.
