I'm curently reading To be a Slytherin by Morgana Deeyn and I've just come across the ferret scene in year four. And it got me thinking.

I don't think we've ever seen someone transform into an animal that isn't an animagus. And how would that even work? I mean, if becoming an animagus is a long and pain-staking process that only a few can truly master, it doesn't make all that much sense that you could simply turn someone into an animal with just a wand. Now, you could argue that that kind of transformation is unstable and dangerous, but I don't see it as a likely option.

So, I see two more likely possibilities regarding Malfoy being turned into a ferret:

a) maybe there's a spell that triggers the transformation in someone that is already an animagus. Moody/Crouch Jr. somehow found out that Malfoy is an unregistered animagus and wanted to show to the entire school that fact and get Malfoy into trouble to get some points with Harry. But as he is “mad” people just thought that he hit Malfoy with a really nasty jinx. The only person to notice what had actually happened would have been McGonagall, but seeing that she never told any of the Marauders to get registered, she might be against ministry meddling in the whole animagus transformation and simply kept quiet.

b) Moody/Crouch Jr. didn't actually know that Malfoy was an animagus and just shot a somewhat dark jinx that somehow had a negative impact on Malfoy because he was an animagus. Again, Moody is “mad” so the students simply though that he's being crazy and McGonagall again didn't want the ministry to get any info on something she might consider a private matter.

So what do you think? Is it possible that Malfoy could actually be a secret animagus? The form fits him, I'd reckon.


** I believe that he was just transfigured into the animal. If he was an Animagus, I think he'd be closer to a badger

*** But i still don't get why anyone would become an animagus if a simple wand based teansfigurations does the trick and changes you into an animal? That little detail has bugged me for years.

**** Okay so these are headcanon but I think they're reasonable. The animagus transformation is a wandless self transfiguration where the person is able to change states on their own. The animagus transformation also keeps the human mind while transformed. Regular Human transfiguration on the other hand requires a wand so the transfigured individual can't easily revert since they can't wield their wand. Also I believe the animal instincts overpower the human mind to some extent with regular human transfiguration.

**** A good way to view it is that becoming an Animagus has expected outcomes, whereas the transfiguration spell could end up backfiring and being irreversible

**** In the Tales of Beedle the Bard there was little footnotes throughout. Supposedly written in by Dumbledore. The ones on the Babbity Rabbity story say that an animagus can change into an animal and retain their human mind, so are able to change themselves back. If someone is only transfigured, they just have an animal mind and rely on someone else to change them back.

** Interesting theory, however:

In the same book, we both learn from Professor Mcgonagall that transforming a person into an animal is possible. (Same scene, when she sees it she tells moody that they do not use transfiguration as a punishment.

Also in the same book, a bit later, we see Krum using partial self transfiguration to obtain the head of a Shark in order to solve the second task. In the book it states that he did the transfiguration badly and that he only transfigured his head.

Both scenes together make me believe that human to animal transfiguration is possible if you are not an animagus. It also makes me believe that it has to be very difficult as Krum only manages to do it badly. Further I would assume it to be difficult to reverse if you are not experienced in the field, which makes it even more dangerous.

And finally as Mcgonagall mentions that it is not used as punishment at Hogwarts, I kinda feel like we can assume that it is uses as such in other schools or situations which means it is most likely not a comfortable transfiguration to go through, especially if it is forced on you.

All of that makes it very different form an animagus transformation.

Also in GoF Draco is a bit young to be an animagus as it takes a lot of work to become one. I mean we hear that it takes james and sirius quite a while to accomplish it and we do not hear about any other animagi below the age of 17, meaning that it is unlikely that draco would have accomplished it before the start of his 4th year.

But as always this is just my interpretation of the situation so feel free to comment/correct me if I made a mistake.

** Animagi can transfigure themselves without a wand, which is much more useful and I assume harder than being transfigured by someone else with a wand.

** It's a fun idea, but almost definitely not canon.

  I don't think we've ever seen someone transform into an animal that isn't an animagus.
#+end_quote

Krum partially turned into a shark. Canary Creams turned several people into birds. Percy hit Thicknesse with a spell that "seemed to be turning [Thicknesse] into some form of sea urchin" (though that could just be describing the effects of a jinx, and not a literal and complete transfiguration). And Hermione turned into a catgirl, but that probably shouldn't count.

As for why you would become an animagus instead of just transfiguring yourself, in GoF, Hermione said

#+begin_quote
  “If only we'd done human Transfiguration already! But I don't think we start that until sixth year, and it can go badly wrong if you don't know what you're doing.”
#+end_quote

And then in sixth year, they're only changing the color of their eyebrows by the time they reach the Christmas break. So I think it's safe to say that safely transfiguring a human into an animal is probably really hard. The animagus process, on the other hand, is actually pretty easy, though it is time-consuming (according to Pottermore-canon, at least).

But even if we ignore Pottermore and assume that the animagus transformation is a difficult exercise in transfiguration, there may still be reasons to do it.

- The animagus transformation might be harder to learn, but easier to do.
- A more specific possibility for the above, an animagus transformation might be "automatically complete," whereas normal transfiguration may require you to be able to completely visualize the animal, making it a lot easier to mess up.
- An animagus might automatically get certain instincts associated with the animal, such as how to move in their new body, whereas someone who transfigures themselves into an animal might have to figure it all out for themselves. This would be especially important for any animals that fly, swim, or otherwise travel in ways humans are not used to, or otherwise have limb configurations unfamiliar to humans (and I think that covers almost every animal).
- An animagus can probably transform without a wand.
- It may be harder to detect an animagus than it is to detect a transformed human.
- Since your animagus form is related to your personality, becoming an animagus may be a form of self-discovery.
- It's a good way to prove how good you are at transfiguration.

I have seen it speculated that it may be easier to "keep your mind" and not "be lost in the animal" or something as an animagus. However, I do not think this is likely to be the case, since Slughorn turned himself into a chair and back without issue. Surely, being stuck as an inanimate object is much more likely and more dangerous than being stuck as an animal.

** The whole animagus concept is really weird. We know from as early as chapter 4 in PS that people can at least be partially transfigured (Hagrid giving Dudley a pig's tail). Then we discover he isn't supposed to do magic and then later that he was expelled quite early in his schooling, and his whole thing gives us the impression he is quite childish, naive and not really academic or especially well-learned. Then, in HBP, Professor Slughorn shows up, literally, as an armchair that he transfigured himself into. That obviously means he can /Un/transfigure himself from that state. That begs the question of why such prodigies of Transfiguration such as James, Sirius and Professor McGonagall would even bother with becoming animagi if they can simply transfigure themselves into animals and just as easily untransfigure themselves.
