** This site hasn't been relevant in nearly a decade, and it's mostly their fault. Looks like a bunch of drama queens fighting over almost nothing. A lot of those posts are labeled 2014, so I'm not really sure why they're being brought up now?

** Sorry, but I'm all out of outrage.

The bit about HPFF being 'the most popular source for HP fanfic' is funny, though. I'd like to see a citation for that claim.

**** Now that you mention it, I don't think I have either. Good catch.

On the plus side, though, the most popular stories there seem to be Rose/Scorpius so the next time someone requests that pairing we'll have a place to send them.

** Not gonna lie I read every word of that and about half of what that Jay guy said sounded completely reasonable and I agreed with him. I stopped halfway down because at that point there were only random out of context words that I couldn't attribute to anyone in particular and honestly I don't know anything about HPFF.net to know any better. Also you posted this from a throwaway, man up and share this properly if you're going to cause drama. I can only assume you're one of the people that was fired and that's why there seems to be a gap between "sorry you feel that way, let's talk" (paraphrasing) and "you're all fired".

*** I have to agree, reading through it, about half of what the Jay fellow said sounded quite reasonable. #17 was the first image that showed me any sort of response that sounded rude. Everything else before that seemed fine to me. I also noticed that there seemed to be conspicuous gaps, namely, the OP willfully editing out the chat logs or receipts he or she compiled with her constituents before (and after) deciding to e-mail this Jay fellow. There are parts of the story that seem to be oh-so-conveniently missing.

** Image #19 really sums it up.

I forgot the site even existed until now and I will go back to doing so. Hosting + domain name costs are negligible and any site owner with that kind of attitude doesn't need my traffic.

** tl;dr - The owner of HPFF, Jay, is a vile jackass that speaks to people like they're filth. Some special gems of the above comments include Jay telling adults with mostly professional, full-time jobs that he will refuse to give them a recommendation for a job if requested. He additionally compares the staff to McDonalds workers.
