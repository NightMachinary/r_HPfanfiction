** The "Aine" series by Velvethope is an old favorite. Part 1, "17, Clumsy and Shy" is complete. Part 2, "In Essence: Undivided" is in progress and they are actively updating.

  A blast from the past of H/G fandom. Originally written pre-HBP, this is my little tale of what could have been. Harry finds out what being 17 is all about. And Ginny gets to help. An Irish Goddess and a new prophecy go along for the ride. It is a Coming of Age story with intrigue, magic and love.

  The sequel to 17, Clumsy & Shy. Harry begins his final year as he and Ginny embark on a new relationship filled with danger, mystery and plenty of Voldemort shenanigans to keep them hopping. New friends and new bonds are made, and some old friends are lost. Started pre-HBP and now, finally, after many years, it will indeed be finished.

  AU: When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween night, she not only created a living legend in Charlus Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply. What will happen when a more jaded, more focused, and more gifted Harry Potter shows up at Hogwarts in 1991 after being abandoned and forgotten? Fem!Voldemort, WBWL
