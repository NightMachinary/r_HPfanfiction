So, as there any good 'Harry annihilates the Wizarding World/Wizarding Britain fics due to their practice of /insert social injustice here/' fics? I read 'Something Like Your Family' [Link below] recently and now I'm curious if it's actually possible to create a compelling story out of "Magicals do something bad to Harry/Harry's friends, Harry plots and plans and destroys their society in response".

At a stretch, I'll take something significantly-politically-changing like Democracy [Link below] or 'that tradition is stupid and cruel, let's stop the tradition' fics as well (like Exposure [Link below] by Bobmin) - significantly changing a society is along similar vibes, I guess. :D But yeah, apart from Democracy and perhaps Made of Common Clay [Link below], I've never really read a fic (that I remember right now :D) that told that kind of changing-the-society story in an interesting, non-'angsty Harry shouts at everything then makes everything cry with his incredible POWAH' way. I guess 'Muggles take over and change Wizarding Britain' fics would also count, by that metric.

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking. Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

  After Sirius dies, Harry is isolated and feels betrayed by everyone who's been around him recently and leaves to figure out what he should do. An "old friend" is sent to look after him and try to bring him back. Together they search for a way to kill a Dark Lord and maybe fix society too.

*** Heh. Literally all I remember of this fic is Harry being cranky on an Island with Fleur and then something about banking - if I don't remember the destruction bit, methinks it's time for a reread. :D

Another contender is linkffn(Guy Fawkes Day by MisterQ).

*** Ah, Wish Carefully. That is a fun one. It's not so much Harry destroying/changing the country as Harry letting them destroy themselves though. It's good enough that I can ignore that, though. :D

Never heard of the other fic, but it looks fun. So, thanks for that rec! :)

  English story; girl!Harry. It had been four years since Malfoy had changed her... four years since the War had ended. It was time for her to come back.

** I forget the name, but there's one fic which is written from Hermione's perspective as like a history book excerpt. Where it's heavily AU, they train both Harry and Neville from early childhood to fight the war, but Neville ends up dying due to some experimentation they did on them. After winning the war Harry studies quantum mechanics and figures out how reproduce magic with technology and gives said tech to muggles, which leads to the wizarding world becoming unnecessary.

** Dunkelzahn's continuation of Enter the Dragon is looking like Harry might tear down the British Wizarding World. It's a crossover with Shadowrun, but speaking as someone who's never played the game, you don't need any SR knowledge.
