** Ah yes, the instant close list. Here it is:

- Harry going on long rants about how horrible his life is to Dumbledore (all caps for extra effect ofc)

- Bashing

- May your enemies- no, shut up.

- Hermione wank

- Muggle wank

- OC wank

- Luna pulling some master-class act as her 'weirdness'

- 11-year-old slytherins seeing the twitch of a muscle in someone's face and making a sherlock holes-esque deduction from it

- Long-ass author notes explaining stuff i.e the setting of their fic or justification for a character's actions, etc. This should be a part of your actual story, broski.

- Harry is 7'1, built like a tank, has more magical power and knowledge than Merlin and the founders combined, but somehow things happen exactly as in canon.

- Glorifying Snape and Draco, those guys were assholes. Fuck 'em.

- Angst

- Best friend Neville (you've got potential.mp4)

- 600k words, 1st year complete

I'm sure there's more I haven't thought of, but yeah.

While I totally agree with you that inserting modern technology sucks, I think the reason for that is that some writers are really young. They are like 14 or 15 years old. I teach kids that age - they were born around 2005 - they don't know a world without the internet or ipods, laptops and mobile phones. I teach history and last year I asked my 11 year olds if they know when the internet became mainstream - they were totally baffeld when I told them that I didn't had internet at home until I moved in my own flat - and that I am not even 30.

***** Haha, yes. Children are notoriously bad with time. A real understanding about what is a year, a decade or a century is something that only developes during the early stages of puberty - sometimes even later, when they are already nearly young adults (it depends on the individual).

So because the internet was already there when they were born, they know it's something newer, but they can't estimate what "something newer" means in a historical context; I had children who thought it was always there, those who thought it's around for nearly a century, some who thought it's around for 50 years and then a handfull who (correctly) estimated about 15-20 years.

Some of them are bookworms, others aren't - only the games they play are different. I remember that many kids my age had game consoles like the game boy advance when I was around 10-14. We played Pokemon or Zelda in our breaks and the adults were like: "It's the end of the world." "Those kids will never learn to read properly."

The truth is, that every generation had their games and things that were more interesting that books for great parts of their generation. And awareness that things were different before your time (historical awareness) is something you have to learn with age, because it's difficult for a childrens brain to grasp when you have so many things to learn.

Now a lot of them are as common as the British ones for people younger than me, I think it's the Netflix affect, just a lot more American TV.

***** The thing is that many fanfic writers can do research into Britain or into the British school system. We live in the age of the internet where information can be easily found with a simple search. It's understandable for an American writer to not know the British slang or the usage of the English language, but the same thing can't be said with the school system when that can be easily found out.

I write in a funny way but that's because I have British grandparents, received a very Canadian education, and speak French. My cousins overseas have compared my English to that of a French speaker, but with the added bonus of Canadianisms. Apparently, I only sound British when I am 'incredibly angry'. :P

I grew up in NY, but my parents live in London, so I feel like I should be better at weeding out the Americanisms, but sometimes I feel like I'm trying too hard or messing up so I'll intentionally use Americanisms. Like, I would never have a character call another character a "bellend". I'd always say "dick". I'm also insecure about saying "arse" instead of "ass".

The one thing I absolutely always forget is that "trousers" are pants and "pants" are underwear. Actually, if anyone could tell me what a British person would call "snow pants", I'd love to just go back and edit it. And I struggle to weed "like" out of dialogue.

I am a Canadian so am exposed to the British English and to American English all the time. The 'Canadian' editions of Harry Potter that I grew up with are the UK editions. However, an American pen pal of mine sent the first three books of the American editions to me in an exchange, and they are different. The language in the American editions is different in comparison to the UK (or Canadian) editions. I suspect that to make things easier for an American audience that the publisher edited these books heavily.

So I was exposed to the language through that, but due to being born in another country outside of Britain, I have picked up a lot of my own country's English. However, there's a lot of literature that is written by British authors or television/movie set in Britain where you can really pick up the language spoken in the UK.

When I was more active in fandom, I always got a Britpick to make sure that the language was alright. There are so many writers/betas out there that will be more than happy to look at your fic and edit it, give you advice, etc. Not a lot of people ask for help in fandom, unfortunately.

I can understand the thick English accents from Yorkshire, but can't really understand the dialect if my family from there speaks Yorkshire English. The ones from London don't really have that problem and I can understand them just fine. Sometimes, I have to speak louder to my cousins because of my accent, but sometimes I get the feeling that they are just pulling my leg and are saying that they can't understand me when they can.

The French side of the family is the same way. I had a French cousin in France that refused to speak to me unless I deepened my very obvious Canadian French accent. I refused to speak French out of spite. Every time she spoke to me in French, I would answer her in English.

I don't understand Scottish English as well as I do the English spoken in England. I once read a book (a medieval mystery series) by a Scottish author that wrote a lot of Scottish slang or Scottish English into her book and half the time I couldn't understand what she was trying to say. I mean I loved the book for what it was, but my enjoyment of the story went down because I felt like I needed a dictionary and felt real stupid. I can understand what is being said to me by a Scottish person who is speaking in English.

I really don't like these. To me, it just looks like the author wants their character to be so overpowered and revered upon entrance to the magical society, as if anyone would give an 11 year old the time of day. Harry Potter defeated the dark lord when he was a baby and in canon he still gets looked down on by his peers when they get annoyed at him because that's how people are.

Things I specifically don't like about the above point: - Harry/OC finds out about the magical society and immediately knows all the right questions to ask in their first trip to Diagon Alley - calls Dumbledore out on his shit in their first meeting - teaches themselves Occlumency in their first or second year - somehow knows how to interact with every other student to resolve any conflicts and with their wise words gets them on their side - outsmarts professors---the experts in their field---on topics with cool confidence despite not even knowing of the wizarding world a few months ago - is just good at every single thing they do

I feel like authors who write like this just want to show how much more powerful and smart they would be if they lived in Harry Potter. But it's so unrealistic because no character, unless they're an SI reborn or placed in the HP universe, would just happen to have enough knowledge to do all this and be so perceptive and understanding of EVERYTHING at a glance.

** I don't like bashing but also definitely think that writers should be able to criticize the grey characters. I don't like excessive idolization either. It's funny, but a lot of my least favorite examples actually come from Cursed Child. The characters will say "by Dumbledore" when a muggle would say "by God," and treating Dumbledore like a god was part of what led him astray when he was younger. I try to rationalize it by telling myself that wizards take the Lord's name much more seriously than muggles, which is why they almost always swear by historical figures instead of God, but I simply do not see Harry casually saying "by Dumbledore."

I don't like overlooking flaws either. After reading a bunch of fan fictions revolving around Draco, I was shocked when I reread the series and remembered what a complete prick he was. Like, he's a pathetic coward and bully. I even write fics centered around Draco because exploring a character's flaws is fun, but a lot of writers overlook the fact that he was awful and genuinely pathetic. The Slytherins suck. Protagonists don't have to be completely morally upstanding people, and the flaws need to be acknowledged. Draco's not a cool bad boy. He's a spoiled brat. Own it.

I will not read something if the dialogue is written using something other than quotation marks (usually either ' or <<) or if there are big spaces between paragraphs. It just really bothers me.

I don't like when authors get really personal or make commentary on the plots or characters in the notes. I want to forget the author is a person. I have to fight the urge to do this (and don't always succeed), so I completely understand the draw, but it makes me feel weird.

I don't like overpowered children or children knowing spells they would never know. I make this mistake too and think that writers should look up spells to see what year they would learn them if they're writing young characters. I want characters to have at most one or two special abilities, like maybe they're really good at Occlumency or learn the Patronus really young or can do Dumbledore-level magic like the fire whip, but not all of those.

I don't like uncontrollable wandless magic unless it's a metaphor for a mental disorder; if I use it, what I mean to communicate is that the character is bipolar without attaching the actual label. People being impressed by Harry accidentally making explosions because he's so strong is weird to me. Accidental magic is something you're supposed to learn to control as a child, so I view it as the equivalent of having a temper tantrum.

I don't like characters having as much information about the world as readers. I don't think Harry would tell the wizarding population absolutely everything about his life, but if he did, I want a writer to tell me that. I once saw a character reference Queenie from Fantastic Beasts and like maybe she's about to become infamous if she works for Grindelwald, but it was weird. I make this mistake in second generation a lot and tell myself that it's okay if it's coming from one of Harry's kids, but I don't really think it's okay. For example, I doubt a child would know about the half-blood prince or sectumsempra. Those things are really personal and wouldn't be necessary in any testimony. I don't think he'd tell people about the hallows. I am conflicted about how much I think the wizarding world would know about horcruxes.

As you can see, most of these are things that I have caught myself doing and tried to correct.

But even if I used the symbols from my mother tongue I don't think anyone would have trouble with it because they make perfect sense.

** Overpower Hermione: I love her, but I already have read fics that Dumbledore says she's smarter than him and she's not even graduated. In the same fic, Hermione learns how to build a quidditch broom "just in case".

Draco Malfoy as Head Boy in 8th year: even though I read these fics every now and then, I'm pretty sure Draco would be a persona non grata, far from receiving this position. There was one good fic that explored this as Draco suffering bullying from other students that lost people during the war and Macgonagal turning a blind eye to the situation because she's not feeling very charitable towards him either.

More realistically, for 8th fics, Hermione and Neville as Head students make WAY more sense.

Hermione prefers doing ____ the Muggle way: I can understand preferring to boil water for tea using a kettle, but I don't understand so many authors writing that Hermione prefers doing the dishes by hand. Seriously, who likes to wash dishes? Didn't humankind invent dishwashers to exactly avoid this task? It's even more annoying when this fics portrait HG as a workaholic. After a long shift ar work, the least thing I want to do after coming home is to wash dishes.

Muggle tech being used in a lazy way: self explanatory and plenty of people already mentioned it in other comments.

Suddenly everybody knows how to perform Patronus spell: Canon always says how hard is to master this spell, but then in a lot of fics everybody just uses it all the time for communication. If it was so easy and wide-spread, why bother with owls? For me, it doesn't seem that technically is a hard spell to perform, but of having a happy memory strong enough to cast the spell. Surely not everybody will be able to do that.

What bothers me is, for example, is either Pansy Parkinson casting it in fics where she's only a spoiled brat (so she's not working as an Auror, or something like that) or Minister Hermione's secretary using it instead of the memos, you know? It's almost the same issue as fics that makes cell phones kind of common for the wizard folk.

The point about Hermione, it mostly just feels to me as a cheap/easy way to reinforce that HG is a muggleborn and "doesn't forget her roots". There's more to it than just the fact that I just hate doing dishes (I actually do) haha.

Why can't it be a weekly visit to a muggle library/bookstore? Or going to watch a movie?

For Welsh Mythology, have a look at the early sources of the Arthurian Legends and the Mabinogion. I would also recommend 'The Ancient Celts' by Barry Cunliffe. It discusses Iron Age Celts but many of the tenets of mythology (veneration of the number 3 and votive offerings to bodies of water) still survive(d).\\
All the information is just a google away.

*** I /do/ actually use canonical reasons/characteristics for */slight/* bashing.

Snape for mind-raping Harry and being a dick, the Dursleys because I may or may not be exaggerating Harry's abuse /slightly/, Dumbledore for being a cryptic son-of-a-bitch and for trying to control Harry and ignoring his abuse, Ron for fourth year, Hermione for events that will happen in third year that will make them loose friends in the end, Sirius for going after Pettigrew, and Molly for taking over Sirius's house and trying to mother Harry and for being overbearing.

I'd rather say dark, light, and neutral for different political views. But then there's Dark, Light, and Grey for "magic classification." Like a genetic way your magic swings or whatever. Like you're better at that type of magic over others. And Dark magic is just a different type of magic. Like how some people are better at Charms while others are better at Transfiguration. Some people are better at Dark magic, some Light, and then there's Grey magic which is strictly neither light nor dark but also both.

For my own headcanon (which I don't always use), when you join the Wizengamot (like when your parents step down) and you're inducted, you get to choose whether or not you're conservative, neutral, or liberal (is that the right word?). And you can change this at any time.

I used the magical core thing simply to explain my version of magic. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/lp4upg/just_posted_the_new_chapter_for_my_fic_hbi_hr_at/gobqyif/?context=3][Here]] is a link to a reply I made describing my version of magic.

Harry definitely would've done something similar, Hell, he has done something similar, but Harry is still going to be on the fence for whether or not Sirius is someone he should completely trust. I'll be bringing up a whole "Who do you trust more, me or Dumbledore?" in my fic, for both Sirius AND Remus.

Think of it this way.

At a MINIMUM Sirius should have taken Harry to Dumbledore personally, because at least Sirius can magically defend himself.

Sirius prioritized revenge over the best living connection that he had to his best friend.

What does it matter that Hagrid had Sirius' bike? It's HAGRID we're talking about, and he isn't allowed to use magic of any kind. He had his wand snapped, so he's defenceless as far as the ministry knows. Besides that, he hasn't had any real form of magical schooling, as he was kicked out in, what, 4th year? Death eaters would easily be able to overpower him whether he was by the house or in the air on the bike, as they've finished their schooling and don't have any qualms regarding using lethal means.

It was INCREDIBLY irresponsible of Sirius to go after Peter. He knew all of that, he knew that Harry was still in danger out in the open like that, as Voldemort could've had backup just around the corner. Besides that, many of the Death Eaters were still out and about, as evidenced by The Longbottom Attack which happened AFTER Voldemort had died. Any alive Death Eater could've gone after Harry after Sirius left. Sirius didn't even know where Hagrid was taking Harry, if anywhere.

So yeah, I can understand bashing Sirius' actions because of this, despite him obviously acting out of grief then.

His first priority should definitely have been Harry's safety at the time.

Harry doesn't hate anyone in my fic, though he does get annoyed at a few characters?

I don't really know how to explain. I don't exaggerate situations much, none of the characters do anything so out of character (like love potions) that would make the reader or Harry/any other character hate them unecessarily, I don't depict any chracters as horrible people (I only use their canon characteristics, such as Molly's overbearing and pushiness), no one just outright attacks Harry (or any other character) for no reason (I mean, other than Voldemort, but that's to be expected).

** I'm a huge fan of Canon Divergence. So for me when something that's labeled Canon Divergence when they mean Alternative Universe.

Canon Divergence basically means if this one thing was different how would that impact the story. It means that everything before the What if? Is canon.

For me I'm happy with it just being Book Canon. Sure you can get creative with it. For example it's canon that Molly and Arthur married right after Hogwarts. Now we know because of the wiki when Bill was born 9 years after the fact. But because we don't know how old Molly and Arthur in book canon. I'm alright if an author wants to make the reason they got married quickly was due to a unplanned bun in the oven, then them being younger then canon.

What I can't stand is let's say you have a Ravenclaw Harry and he's smarter then canon Harry or just likes to read books. Ok awesome sure. Now if you have the same canon Hermione and you /don't/ have a scene where Harry makes an different impact on his first meeting with Hermione she then can't suddenly be a Slytherin. Canon Hermione is still then is destined to Gryffindor.

If the change doesn't do anything to impact or change the “fate” (because we know what's going to happen in the books) then the fate would still continue. Same thing can be applied to the past.

A What if Harry was Abused(you know more then he was in canon) fic you can't suddenly have the twins in Hufflepuff or muggle tech working or Snape being married. Because that /change/ the fanfic is proposing can't have an impact on past events to change them. If you have that then it's an called an AU.

All I'm asking for is for you to please properly label your fanfic.

What I can't ignore however are all the dipshit names for Dumbledore/Voldemort that for reasons I honestly can't comprehend authors still think are clever or funny such as Dumbledork/Dumb-as-a-door/Voldieshorts/The Dark Tosser etc. etc. etc. They sucked when whoever it was first wrote them and they still suck now. Even if I've been relatively enjoying a fic before that, the first time I see it used seriously in a fic I cringe so hard I have muscle cramps and auto x out.

** The use of far too many family names. Like in canon we have Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, but does anyone call him that? No! He is just Albus Dumbledore.

So why the fuck is everyone calling Harry Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Peveral etc etc

I'm in a bit of a minority in that I actually LIKE alot of the stories with Harry controlling all those houses, but this pisses me off because that's not how it would work. At WORST he would be Harry Potter-Black and in EXTREMELY formal settings he would be INTRODUCED as Harry Potter-Black "of the houses Potter, Black, Gryffindor, etc etc"

Based on a skim read, it seems like a good attempt, thought there are a few things that stand out to me. Minerva being from An Gearasdan (Fort William) and seemingly being Gaidhlig native, likely wouldn't speak Scots like that. Also very minor but the lack of a ‘Hiv and hae' distinction, though this may differ to your experience.

Some of it seems closer to Scottish Standard English than Scots.

-superhero!Harry who has a bajillion different skills/traits/powers that apparently he was born with that service only for stale plots. Like no thank you, goodbye. I understand that some skills, yanno maybe Harry has a weak metamorphagus ability because both his parents carried that recessive gene. Or Harry has untapped legilimency ability, meaning that If he were to train, he'd be better at the skill than average. But making him a super overpowered main character? He's an 11 year old neglected, overwhelmed child. Shove right off

-snarry. Need I say more?

-goblins are crafty little bastards who most certainly dislike wizards at best, want to slaughter them in their sleep at worst. They would not offer all these bloody services. Especially not for free to a child who they could very easily exploit for gold.

-overly abused Harry. Maybe a bit contraversial, but this so would not have happened without social services being alerted. Harry was definitely neglected, without a doubt, and abused to an extent. He was probably touch starved, emotionally stunted and malnourished. He would not, however, be whipped with chains and bat's without either dying or being so severely injured teachers couldn't ignore it. I also just hate really badly written fanfics that have no idea what child abuse/neglect does to a child. Do some research, please.

-I also hate most ravenclaw! Harry fics. They just seem to thing Harry in Canon is thick as Scottish mud. Harry was an intelligent child, powerful in his own right. But he was, again, stunted by his upbringing and childhood trauma. Ravenclaw Harry fics piss me off. Yes, maybe he'd be more academically inclined, but he would not spend all day in a library because books. Man's would still be curious and adventurous

Canon divergence fics that still rigidly follow stations of the canon -- same events, same people dying, etc. (Time travel stories that extract drama from worrying over events being fated to happen can make this work.)

Dude, they literally starved him as punishment, locked him up without a bathroom, and burned or hut him when he did stuff wrong.

**** know the Dursleys were horrible to Harry, and I did not make light of it. Horrible abuse happens, and it's inexcusable. We, as adults, are supposed to protect children, not harm them.

Anyway, I'm talking about fics where Vernon and Dudley beat him with baseball bats, cut into hin with knives for the hell of it, and break every bone in his body.

These fics tend to be awful, and badly written trigger pieces. Often, the fic simply starts like that, with no build up, or anything. It's like author simply decided to have his relatives kill Harry.

Yes, I call it excessive, because it goes well beyond anything mentioned in canon. (NOT counting emotional abuse/neglect, which often has more lasting consequences). I drop fics like that immediately.

As to your other point. I don't understand what you're on about. Did I mention Americans anywhere in that point about guns? Explain, please.

And another point. You're supposedly from the UK, and as such, you should notice a difference in the way authors write. You know, phrases, idioms and the like. It should not be that hard to for an Englishman to spot an American. Especially when I, an Icelander can often spot them. I sometimes get the feeling writers are from the US. I check out their profile/bio on ffn. Lo and behold, they are from the US.

Now, they may not be American, but simply be writers who are influenced by American English via video games, movies, TV, and music. I can look past many things, but using words like "mom", instead of "mum", annoys me to no end. And I really don't think UK teens "go hang at the mall"...

***** The latter was just a joke because a lot of fics that add guns clearly have American gun culture in mind when it's completely different in the UK. Even if you watch US TV or games, it's just not the same here, and there's very little chance for people to avoid that fact. So if Harry has a Glock, an American probably wrote the fic.

I read one (which I dropped pretty quick) for example where somehow a nuclear weapon was involved and it was just bizarre that Harry kept talking about "the nukes"

And yeah, I mentioned other words/idioms/phrases Americans use by mistake in a different comment.

Also, wow... I've never come across a fic where the Dursleys were like that. Some that expanded on the canon stuff with more description, but never any that took it that far. I have no idea why people would do that, as I say the abuse was enough to kill him already, no need to make it worse again still.
