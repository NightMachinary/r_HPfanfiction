[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a1zs9YAvkk]] So this is a fan made Voldemort movie trailer and i just saw the trailer and thought everyone should see it. The story looks great and the acting looks amazing and it feels like a legit HP movie. Tell me what you think and looking forward to the fanfics friends.


** I really don't know why everyone is going wild for this. It looks pretty but if the acting is anything like the narration it will be shockingly bad, and the story and OC doesn't exactly inspire either. I know people are saying that they have permission from WB but I still don't think this is actually going to happen.

*** Finally someone agrees. On the fact that it won't be all that good, that is. I'm pretty hopeful that it will actually be finished, however.

** I thought it was a cool idea until I saw the OC and then I just sighed because that right there is just a bucketful of nope for me. I avoid OC's like the plague in fanfic and the same goes for fanmade movies like this. I would have been interested if it was just about Tom's uprising.

** What? The? FUCK?

This is the first time I've seen this and until the last frame I thought it was some parody on a shitty Fanfic none of us in this sub would read. I mean I'll watch it if it is produced but come on isn't it pointless from the start? This heir of Gryff obviously failed or canon would not have happened. If she achieved anything noteworthy there would have been some mention of it somewhere in the order. ugggh so much potential in this universe and this is what they choose to do?

*** Knowing outcome of the story doesn't necessary makes a story less interesting.

Though the "Heir of Gryffindor" angle doesn't have me holding any hopes for the plot of this one.

*** It'd be fucking hillarious if they make her confrontation with Voldemort last 3 sec before she's dead or something.

** Maybe I'm just retarded, but I have no idea what people mean when they say audio quality in the teaser is bad.

But yeah, I've no expectations for this. "Heir of Gryffindor" is an instant turn-off, OC or not. There actually have been great OCs (also OCs in all but name) in the fandom, but this seems like it's treating "Heir of X" like it's an official title. Sort of like the whole things with the fanon practically inventing Marauders because people misplaced the apostrophe. But Marauders at least don't usually go beyond an unofficial club of a bunch of schoolboys.

*** It's not the audio quality, it's just the narration is poorly acted and the accent is terrible.

** If nothing else it should be interesting. Maybe no good, but definitely a guilty pleasure and it's cool to see a fan film with decent production qualities.

** I mean we all know she loses though because if she does beat him then there wouldnt be a harry potter series. But I do like the idea of voldemort being hunted but someone.
