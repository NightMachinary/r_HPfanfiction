I don't like to read a lot of stories written in first person. I don't know why, maybe it is because most of the stories written that way turn me off.

Do you like them? Is there a "right" or "wrong" way that makes a difference?


** I generally don't like it.

But there is always exception since *Seventh Horcrux* is my favorite story.

** No, I don't think there is a right or wrong way - it's all down to personal preference, the same as with tenses. I can't stand stories (fanfic or original works) written in present tense, but other people don't mind it or even prefer it to past tense.

Likewise, I don't like first person as much, for the most part, while others love it, and neither of us are wrong. I can be convinced by good writing, but it does make me hesitate when I see it's in first person. I think it's because HP canon is in third person, so it just doesn't feel very 'Harry Potter' to me? At least that's the best reason for it I can articulate, since I'm not generally bothered by it in original stuff (though I still like third person best). Second person, however, I loathe with my entire being, and I would rather gag on a mouth guard for an hour than read it, regardless of how well it's written.

** It has its merits. Having both read and written first-person fics, the margins are a lot smaller: it's a lot harder to write than third-person, but once you get the hang of it, it's also a lot more fun to write than your run of the mill third-person story.

Of course, first person a bit irksome to read, particularly for people who are very used to conventional third-person stories, but if you really want to get into a character's head, there's really no substitute for it. My humour fic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9121877/1/Midnight-Blues][Midnight Blues]], wouldn't be half of what it is if it wasn't told from Harry's POV.

** First-person is fine with me as long as the writer knows what they're doing and is good at convincing me this voice belongs to that character. They also have to be aware of the particular limitations of first person POV. There are a lot of pitfalls to first-person, similar to third-person but somehow more grating when it's meant to be the character's thoughts or stream of consciousness. Too many first-person fics feel instantly OOC. And violating the inside POV will throw me right out - Harry describing an expression on his own face, for example, or knowing something he couldn't possibly know because the writer has forgotten they can't suddenly info-dump the way they could in a more flexible 3rd-person narrative. You can't reveal a backstory if Harry has no plausible reason to know that backstory.

It usually takes me a page or so to adjust to the writer's conception of a character's voice, but if it feels plausible, I can give myself over to a story just as easily as if it were 3rd-person. And if I enjoy being in that character's head, I'm happy to read thousands of words.

If the voice feels wrong or I simply don't believe it, I backbutton. Very few writers can manage 1st-person Snape, for instance. Ditto 1st-person Dumbledore - although, come to think of it, I'm not sure I've actually read 1st-person Dumbledore. Even close third would be difficult in his case. Also, Hermione. All three of these characters have habits of mind that require high degrees of competence, but their intelligence would express itself very differently.

In some ways, I'm more likely to lavish praise on someone who executes a good 1st-person POV because, done right, it's a huge challenge. So I'd give extra points to anyone with the writing chops to pull it off.

*** What about future tense then? Here's a sample of text rewritten for your enjoyment:

#+begin_quote
  Rain is going to be coming down in sheets. The streets will be dark and empty, barely illuminated by lamps whose light will struggle to break through the fog to pool faintly below. On either side are going to sit rows of unspectacular townhouses, that will form a dreary fa√ßade of grey-brown bricks. Curtains will be drawn firmly across windows, and any light that is going to escape will be quickly absorbed into the night.

***** I took it from near the start of a fic I'm writing and just changed it from past to future tense as a stupid exercise, but reading through your post I see what you mean.

It does take a good writer to pull it off, but I have seen some stories use tense changes to good effect, especially present tense when describing dream-like sequences or to keep the reader off balance. IIRC linkffn(By That Last Candle's Light) was a great example, but it's used in professional works as well.

Actually, Tim Winton's short story "Big World" might be the only story I know that uses future tense. At the end the MC is stuck out in the desert and it describes what will happen next. It creates a pretty good effect actually.

** I generally don't with fanfiction. I feel it's harder to pull of a good first POV in fanfiction because the fandom already knows how the character is supposed to sound like and what they think, especially in a such a well-established series like Harry Potter. There are lot more opportunities to sound OOC in first person, imo. I'm extra critical with fanfics if they are in first person.

Of course there are always those awesome gems that are the exception, but that's because the author has nailed the character down perfectly.

** Currently, publishing houses tend to prefer manuscripts written in First Person or Third Person Limited because their sales data indicates that's what readers tend to prefer - they want stories where they have a closer connection to the protagonist, something you don't get so easily in Third Person Omniscient.

The general advice seems to be to use First Person if you have a sufficiently interesting/quirky main character and/or your characterization if better than your plot; use Limited if your plot is stronger than your character. The HP stories wouldn't have done so well if they were First Person through Harry's eyes.

There are also some types of stories that can't work well at all except in First Person, like mysteries. Readers need to be kept ignorant of the things that the main character is ignorant of. In contrast, political thrillers and similar stories are usually better in Third Person Omniscient (there's a reason why Clancy always used that).

It's easy to see, then, why First Person is hard to do well. You need a strong main character - strong enough to carry the story and interesting enough for it to be worth being in their head all the time. You also need to be able to construct that plot in a way it will work even though you're only ever seeing things through the eyes of the main character (breaking away from that first person perspective is possible, but needs to be done carefully and rarely).

Some authors manage to do it well and others struggle with it. Jim Butcher, author of the Dresden Files, has written that he had a lot of trouble doing Third Person, but found First Person much, much easier. The first Dresden book was, in fact, his very first attempt at it.

My two current series are Third Person Limited, and I think I do alright at it. I've written one story in First Person and it has been quite the challenge - editing is taking much longer than even the early chapters of my other stuff. I wanted to stretch myself and see if I could do it because I'm developing an original novel that probably ought to be done in First Person - if I can do it well, it will probably end up being a much better story.

*** Or the type I like to read/write in general (not just fanfic), third person limited/mostly limited with shifts to diary entries/letters. Diary entries/epistles are great for getting through the mundane and really developing the character. I'd say letters are better if it's a couple. One thing I hate is the switching POV between a couple (actually, I don't like multiple POV, with the exception of ASoIaF), when that could be done better by separating the couple and having them write letters to each other. You can have epistles in a third person limited type story, and that can actually be really useful for seeing the thoughts of the person the main character is exchanging letters with.
