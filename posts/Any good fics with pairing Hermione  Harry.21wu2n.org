** Vox Corporis is incredible. It may seem like it takes a while for the actual romance to get going, but stick with it, it's worth it. Also, remember that it was written as the most "true" Harry/Hermione fic possible (author's words). Highly recommended, 10/10. About 360,000 words long, and it's fully complete.

** Short one shot is Dearly Beloved By Digfruit. Amazingly done. Shifting Wind by Varagant Boy is really good too. However I think its discontinued now.

** I found one just now: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3811296/1/Closure][Closure]]. What I like about it is that it not too long, paced really well, is set after the war, there's no bashing, and takes into account canon events in DH. This story makes you feel good inside.

** Its an oldie but the best harry Hermione fix around. The series is Paradigm of Uncertainty by Lori summers. It is a trilogy. Honestly I think that fix is better than canon. You can find it on schnoogle

Edit: I figured I should include a summary, Harry works as a spy and when he is targeted he realize how important Hermione is to him. Its also rated R :P

** Try [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4126590/1/Vanilla][Vanilla]] it still works as a one shot but it became a multi chaptered fic.

**** I'm assuming that you haven't read it until the end (or the succeding chapters) have you? This have been recomended to me before back in the old portkey.org forums before. I would suggest reading it until the end.
