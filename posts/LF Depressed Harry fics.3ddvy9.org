I'm in that type of mood. Anything goes, except female Harry, unless you deem it 100% must read, right now. Temporarily f!Harry is fine though.

Post GOF and OotP is fine. Heck, pre-Hogwarts is fine.

Any Dursley incarnation, any ship, any bashing, any sexuality or lack thereof. Dobby to the rescue; Most Magical and Pure of Unicorns to Impart Wisdom and Guidance to the Beleaguered Hero; Goblins are smugly superior but care not for Wizard troubles; Chessmaster Dumbledore, Master of Death shenanigans; Luna gets things done.

Like... Just gimme what you got. I have a need.


** A quick search on Scryer with the angst flag should do the trick. To be honest, it seems almost every post-OoTP fic is exactly what you're looking for...

** Since you say any ship, here's a few fics that are H/D:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10684511/1/Cold][Cold]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7471849/1/Can-you-count-the-stars-where-you-are][Can you count the stars where you are]] are short, but exactly what you're looking for.

Also try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9471590/1/Kiss-the-Joy-Until-the-Sun-Rise][Kiss the Joy (Until the Sun Rise)]].

And try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7545750/1/Miles-to-go-Before-I-Sleep][Miles to go Before I Sleep]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9283480/1/Nothing-Like-the-Sun][Nothing Like the Sun]]. They both have an abused!Harry. Not sure Nothing Like the Sun is exactly what you're looking for, but it sure made me depressed while I was reading it and I'd classify Harry as depressed in there so thought I'd include it.

Happy (sad?) reading!

** I just finished reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6782408/1/Digging-for-the-Bones][Digging for the Bones by paganaidd]] this morning. It's quite long but I liked it well enough.

Authors summary: Because of a student death, new measures are being taken to screen students for abuse. With Dumbledore facing an enquiry, Snape is in charge of making sure every student receives an examination. Abused!Harry. Character death. Sevitis. In answer to the "New Measures for Screening Abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. Yes, it is a "Snape is Harry's biological father" story.

*** The author's other stories, like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6142629/1/Dudley-s-Memories][Dudley's Memories]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6329597/1/Snape-s-Memories][Snape's Memories]] are really excellent, my favorite adult Harry that I've yet read, I think.

As for OP's question, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance][Resonance]] starts out with Harry really depressed, I remember.
