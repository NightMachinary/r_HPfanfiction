Just as the title says I want a Harry that's really good in a fight. He can be good at other stuff too but that's the main one I want. Preferably no slash.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
