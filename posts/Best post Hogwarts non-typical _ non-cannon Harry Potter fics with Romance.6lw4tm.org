Looking for your best recommendations for post-Hogwarts fics featuring Harry (although they can be from his significant others perspective). A couple notes to keep in mind:

- Right off the bat I want to make it clear I am looking for NON TYPICAL. So not necessarily following the agreed upon cannon paths characters take post Hogwarts. NOT golden trio oriented, although its fine if they are included in some way.

- As above, the same is true for pairings and romance. In other words... NOT cannon pairings. NOT golden trio oriented. Hermione/Harry or Harry/Ginny... not what I'm looking for. Daphne/Harry, Harry/Luna, or beyond is ok. This would include going way beyond like Harry/Teacher or Harry/Bellatrix but its not necessary to go that far "beyond".

- In connection with above, I am not interested in main character slash. I do not mind side relationships, but the main characters should be heterosexual. Just a personal preference. So no Harry/Neville or whatever.

- The fic should feature Harry either as the main character, or the main characters romantic interest. However the perspective can be from either side or both.

- While romance should be included, id actually prefer if the plot was more involved or complex then simply a romance. But recommend the lot. Again though... non-typical.

- And finally.... I prefer mature or higher rated stories. T is acceptable but I generally find T stories are treated with kiddie gloves by authors and I dont like that.

I dont mind how dark or light a story is, I dont mind if Harry is good or bad, I dont mind if hes a quidditch star or political powerhouse. I simply want interesting post-hogwarts non typical (non cannon style) Harry Potter oriented fics with romance included. If you read this far, Thanks a ton ahead of time.

*Note: I have read quite a few Daphne/Harry pairing stories such as "The Pureblood Princess" and "Not Quite So Boring", but recommend regardless. Others may be interested and maybe I will find something new.

TL:DR: No main character slash. Romance. Mature+. Non cannon oriented. Not cannon pairings. Post-Hogwarts. Good plot. Not focused on golden trio as a whole but Harry focused.

THANKS!
