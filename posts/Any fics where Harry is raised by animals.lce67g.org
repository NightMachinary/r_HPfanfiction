Kinda like Tarzan or the Mowgli from the Jungle Book, where he is raised from a young age in the wild by animals, whether they be monkeys, wolves, whatever.


** Not sure if it counts but there are some dubious fics where Harry gets adopted by Peppa Pig's family. I recommend not going to that part of the internet though.

  To escape the cold night on November 1, 1981, little Harry Potter's accidental magic kicks in, and he manages to turn himself into a snake and slither away before his aunt can find him in the morning. Raised by snakes, he forgets that he is actually a boy...and then one day he accidentally wanders into a place known by humans as the "Forbidden Forest".

** linkffn(Harry Potter: Adoptive Kaiju by Gojirahkiin) has Harry raised by Kaiju, which is probably close enough.

linkffn(Little Guy by Clell65619) has Harry raised by George from /George of the Jungle/, and I'm pretty sure there were some animals involved.

linkffn(The Natural Animagus by wsbenge) has Harry turn into a kneazle and get raised by kneazles, which aren't exactly wild animals, but it might still be close enough for you to enjoy.

  It seems like fanfics have had baby Harry raised by every character in fiction except for one: Godzilla, King of the Monsters! Watch as I descend into madness trying to take this story semi-seriously, by which I mean that it will have a plot that tries to make it work logically. Well, as logically as possible when you mix kaiju and wizardry...

** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6690487/1/Growing-Up-Kneazle][Growing Up Kneazle]], Harry has a burst of accidental magic and ends up adopted into a Kneazle family as a kitten. When he eventually regains the ability to hooman, his worldview remains rather feline (such as his habit of leaving rooms via windows, no matter how high up they are).

A sort-of-similar concept is in the one-shot [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27669059/chapters/67710089][Hermione's Cat]], where Harry-as-a-panther is raised by a snake in the woods.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.
