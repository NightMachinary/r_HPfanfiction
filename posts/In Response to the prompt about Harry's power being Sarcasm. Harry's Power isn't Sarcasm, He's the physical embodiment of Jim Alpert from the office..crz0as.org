Voldermort walked into the department of mysteries, his alarm spells alerting him that Harry had taken the bait, he didn't know why his Death Eaters hadn't captured the boy, but he would punish them later.

What he found upon entering the department confused him.

Sitting at the entrance hall in a comfy looking leather chair sat The Boy Who Lived, sipping tea and reading what looked to be a book about Divination.

The boy looked up when Voldemort got closer and smiled "oh hey, took you long enough."

"What are you doing Harry?" Voldermort snarled

Harry looked down at his book and then back to Voldemort "Oh you know, reading my divination book, gotta catch up on all that reading for school you know."

"Yes I see that but WHY in the department of mysteries? In front of your ARCH NEMESIS!?"

"Because divination is the biggest mystery of them all?" Harry licked his thumb and turned the page "Obviously."

** "Obviously"

The Dark Lord reached for his wand inside his robes with lightning speed, only pull it out... A block of gelatin?

"What is this?!" Voldemort snarled viciously

"Looks like someone put your wand in Jello," said the boy placidly as he waved his own stick, summoning something in his hand.

"What... How did you do it, Potter?" The wizard hissed perturbed. Clearly someone capable of pranking him like this held power well beyond Harry's years.

Harry looked up from his plate of treacle flavored jello, swallowed his mouthful and calmly said "how'd you know it was me?"

*** "Enough games, Potter!" Voldemort exclaimed. The gelatin seemed to explode, shrouding the Hall in a dark, ominous mist. With a sweep of his now-free wand, the mist was banished with a high-pitched screaming wind. "Now, you shall fall to me before all your... your precious... You aren't Potter."

"I don't know what you're talking about," the slim Asian boy responded.

"Harry Potter has his mother's green eyes," Voldemort hissed suspiciously. "And he's not Asian."

"Hey, kudos to you for not seeing race, man," 'Harry' said, holding up a picture of James Potter, with one arm around an Asian woman. "But I think me and my mom have the same eyes."

The duel was interrupted shortly after, when Neville accidentally spilled a large pot of his famous chili.
