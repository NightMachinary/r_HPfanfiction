I've been watching the new Witcher game and the character uses potions before and during battle. Things that give night vision, resistance to poison, endurance, decreased bleeding, etc. That made me wonder if there any HP fics that utilize combat potions. Darts with Draught of Living Death and so on?

I remember there was one where Snape had fortified himself against Nagini's venom, but I'm hoping for a story that features more than just that.


** Haven't met anything yet that would be close enough to Sapkowski's use of potions in the Witcher series.

The only two stories that are more or less relevant are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]] (W: 94,563; Complete), where Harry & Co systematically use Felix Felicis before each battle, and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567][Temporal Beacon]] (W: 428,826; abandoned), where during some Tournament tasks the champions use potions or brewed tools (Chapter 17, 33).

Have you read the Witcher books themselves? There should be at least fan-made translations available online.

** Only one I'm familiar with is The Pureblood Pretense, but that's not until a few books in the series. It hasn't featured any major role yet, but those stories are really good.
