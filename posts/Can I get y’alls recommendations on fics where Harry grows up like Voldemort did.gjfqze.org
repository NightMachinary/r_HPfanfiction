ie... orphanage fics, doesn't matter if it's dark!harry or not, though that's preferable.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12070200][the deepest secret nobody knows]] by Strange_Soulmates is fairly well-written, I don't know why they decided on all-lowercase for the title. Harry grows up in Tom's orphanage, with Tom.

** Do you want them to be good; readable; or cringefest? Because there's not that many in the first category, but the last one has all the (nearly identical) stories.

This story is...well it's readable, even though it's pretty stroke inducing at times. But it's long?

  A twist of fate sends Harry down a much darker path. The question is not how far he will fall, but how many others he will take with him.

  Harry was proclaimed dead when he was two years old and ended up in an orphanage. But that was only the beginning of his journey. While trying to find his place in the world of magic, he never forgets those whom he views as family.

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.
