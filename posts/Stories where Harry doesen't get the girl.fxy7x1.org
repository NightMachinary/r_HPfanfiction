Preferably after the war and with a soldier like Harry


** There's a pretty lengthy oneshot I remember reading. It's with Harry developing a sick obssession with Daphne Greengrass to the point that it leads to him doing really questionable things, specially towards the end of the fic. The climax happens in the chamber of secrets where he brings her for a date. I'd mention more but it's a pretty major spoiler and will definitely ruin your enjoyment of the story. I think It was set during sixth year or possibly after returning for Harry's eight year, not sure but the timeline it's set is between those 2. Trouble is, I forgot what the story is called so I can't exactly provide a link for it. I think the title has a flower's name on it but I'm not completely sure. If someone is familiar, can you provide a link or at least a title? I'm also quite interested in finding it. It's really well-written, iirc.

*** I'm fairly certain that's Intoxication by nos tres reges. It was deleted a while ago but I found a copy somewhere after searching for it way back in the day.

Just did a quick search and found it on the DLP forum [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/intoxication-by-nos-tres-reges-t.15341/page-4#post-750393]]

Enjoy, it's a great story.

Literally the ONLY fic I can think of where both Harry and Ron are in love with Hermione and she chooses Ron.

Though the [Ron W., Hermione G.] kinda spoiled it. .-.

That tag was only added after the relevant chapter was written and published. Originally, it was untagged - I had planned a Harmony story, but as I wrote and let the characters interact, Ron won out.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  AU/OOC: Its been almost 3 years since Harry asked Hermione to the Yule Ball thus starting their relationship and Ron is tired of hiding his feelings. It should be him on her arm. Not the bloody Boy Who Gets Everything. He just cant take it anymore. Will he tell Hermione how he feels? And does Hermione and Harry have some secrets of their own? RW/HG/HP DM/GW PLEASE R&R Complete:)
