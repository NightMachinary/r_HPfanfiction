Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality was demoted to number two on the favorites list of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=4&r=103][FanFiction.Net]] by Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past. I am in desperate need of a distraction from these FFs. I haven't been able to stop thinking about them for over a year and a half. Obviously, the solution is to fall in love with another story. Please Help by leaving suggestions. Though be warned that I've read a lot of the well-ratted FanFictions out there!


** /The Sum of Their Parts/, linkffn(11858167), is by far my most favorite post DH fic. After defeating Voldemort, Harry was betrayed by the establishment once again. He was soon joined by Ron, Hermione, and the DA in his quest to overthrow the old regime, by any means necessary. The Trio relationship was extremely well written.

Have you read /Seventh Horcrux/, linkffn(10677106), yet? It's so hilarious and has some of the most memorable quotes among HP fanfics.

/Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water/, linkffn(12076771): The romantic Trio Harry/Hermione/Ron had to face zombie battleship BismarckMort. Fortunately, HMS Hood also returned to face her nemesis one more time. Excellent fleet actions and flashbacks.

/Weasley Girl/ and its sequel /Weasley Girl: Secrets of the Past/, linkffn(8202739;9932798), are a very interesting and well written fem!Ron story. Because of this change, things went quite differently.

/The Red Knight/, linkffn(12141684), has an adult Ron reborn in a different world. It's a quite mystery that has reviewers speculating about what really happened in that world.

/Divided and Entwined/, linkffn(11910994), is an excellent war fic. The latest chapter has one of the best fight scenes I've read. Voldemort is also very cool in this story.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

Potter's Gang are back for their second year at Hogwarts, and face a dramatic escape, a mysterious diary, a strange cat, a "loony" girl, a hidden monster and many past secrets coming to light.

#+begin_quote
  This is the first of a series of books I wrote for my kids set in the Harry Potter setting and occurring at the same time. These stories are meant to interweave seamlessly with the HP books and focus on characters primarily in the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff houses. The Tamblin books are a tad darker than the HP books, starting at about the level of the 3rd or 4th HP book.

  The third Tamblin story. Family issues. A descent into madness. A shocking crime. I wrote this story with a different style from the Harry Potter formula as an experiment. It begins in medias res, covers about half the school year, and is told through flashbacks.
