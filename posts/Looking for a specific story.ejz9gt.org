It has Death as an entity I believe that it considers harry as a son. Has Remus and Sirius, along with Tom Riddle (still as Voldemort). I believe that it starts with Harry from the future, who dies, and gets reborn, younger then age 11. Has Harry as a sort of King to the creatures. A specific thing I remember is that when Sirius and Remus find out, Sirius upsets harry and Death gives him a talking to, if that helps. Sorry if this isn't the place to ask, I'm not sure where to post this and it's been on my mind for a week constantly and I can't find it.
