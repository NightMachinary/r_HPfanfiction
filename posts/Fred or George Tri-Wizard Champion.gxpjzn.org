Are there any fixes that have Fred or George as Tri-Wizard Champion? I'd read the heck out of it!


** The only one I can think of is linkffn(Oh God Not Again by Sarah1281), and even that one hardly takes it seriously

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating ancient runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG.

** The sadly incomplete and ultra+cracky linkffn(The NOT Triwizard Tournament) has the premise that if the goblet can be fooled once, then it can be fooled again, and again, and again. And again.

It's a silly idea, obviously abandoned, and poorly written - but worth a quick read anyway just for the laughs.

  The Goblet of Fire is not infallible, as proven by the fake Moody. What if he wasn't the only one to take advantage of this? What if other students entered as well? What if, their names came out? GOF era AU. IMPORTANT A/N!
