** Its a running gag.

I think someone, somewhen said that since it has an own subreddit we can stop talking about it here. I think thats the origin of the joke.

Since then: [[/u/denarii]] pls ban HPMOR! pl0x

** The origin of the sentiment came much earlier than the joke- Denarii got hooked into being tormented because he had run an open suggestion box poll in order to drum up ideas for growth and improvement of this subreddit. The most common suggestion was...

** 1. It started because HPMOR. There used to be legit arguments about it, so banning discussion was a real idea. Makes a nice joke now.

2. [[/u/denarii]] is resisting. What a silly thing to do.

** Also, many people were incredibly annoyed with the story and the author. Especially when he was seeking donations to finish the story.

It's the same as being in [[/r/politics]] and wishing to ban Bernie posts because he annoys you and you don't get why so many people have blind faith in him.

**** I waited and finished it when I got really bored not too long ago. I would never have paid for it.

Not sure your downvote is for the brainwashing or calling it a pile of shit. I gave it back.

Not sure on why I got downvoted unless it was the Bernie comment.

*** I don't see why you need to ban a fic or website, just because it annoys you.

Many others also like it.
