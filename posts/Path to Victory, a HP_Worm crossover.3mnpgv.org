A young Severus Snape awakens a unique ability: the titular Path to Victory, inspired by the ability of the same name from Worm. In other words, a limited or goal-oriented form of /omniscience/.

Despite the Gary-Stu premise, the story manages to stay interesting (YMMV) by bombarding Snape with comedy, unintended consequences galore, and the first baby steps of character development. It can be found on the Sufficient Velocity forums, [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/path-to-victory-%E2%80%93-a-severus-snape-story-worm-hp.22564/][here]]


** Is it posted anywhere where I don't need to scroll through a million variations on "GOOD STORY UPDATE SOON PLS"?

*** Yes and no?

On Sufficient Velocity, you can use the index/threadmark buttons at the top left and bottom right of each story post to navigate directly from chapter to chapter, but there isn't a story-only mirror, sorry.

  In Worm you might gain phenomenal powers on your worst day. Snape snapped after the werewolf incident and triggered with Path to Victory, the power that tells you the steps necessary to attain any goal. It's not very serious but I don't think I'll let this turn to crack. I'll keep at this until I'm bored or Snape becomes God-King of the Universe. Whichever happens first!

** I think it would be fascinating to read this from the Prince patriarch's perspective. From Snape, it feels kinda like the author just read the HP chapter with Felix Felicis and kept going. From Augustus' perspective though, his greasy misanthropic nerd of an heir suddenly is becoming rich, pretty, and interesting. Now he has to deal with the decisions of his past and court this seemingly unstoppable Snape.

** I... actually like this. The narrative is on the border between a crackfic and proper storytelling which somehow makes this more readable than I ever expected. It's a lot of fun, and the right choice - the path to victory with magic is too OP for anything else.
