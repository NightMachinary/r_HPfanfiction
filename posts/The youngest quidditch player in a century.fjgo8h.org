Wood: I have had some time to consider yesterday's trials professor.

McGonagall: Very well Wood. What do you think?

Wood: That Bell girl is a great flyer

McGonagall: The second year? Chaser?

Wood: Yes Professor, she just needs a bit of experience and I believe she can become our best goal scorer in time.

McGonagall: Agreed.

Wood: Now as for our seeker position.

*Wood frowns

Wood: Nothing too impressive. There was that one 4th year that I think could fit in well with our team. He seemed a bit fragile, but fairly quick. I think with a bit of conditioning we can...

McGonagall: Oh my... Wood give me a moment please, I shall return for you. You may go back to Professor Quirell's class in the mean time.

*5 minutes later

McGonagall: Could I borrow Wood for a moment?

Quirell: Ah, y-yes. S-sure thing p-pr-Professor.

McGonagall: Wood, I found you a seeker!

*He looked at Harry. Well sure he is indeed the famous Harry Potter, thought Wood, but he's a small eleven year old boy. His pick for seeker was fragile, but this boy looks like a bludger will pass right through him.

Wood: You ever seen a game of quidditch potter?

Harry: No.

Wood: Thanks Professor. I'm sure Harry will do fantastic.

*As he walks away shaking his head


** Little nitpick: In the books she gets Wood out of Flitwick's class (not Quirrel's) and states: "He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-five foot dive. Didn't even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn't have done it."

*** In the 1st film it was Quirrel's class so it depends on what you view as cannon, books or films.

****** That's what I said, but the lines are different for everyone. For me, books are main/primary canon. The films are secondary/supplemental canon. Pottermore is tertiary (though it can tie or even go above the movies). JKR's tweets and such are last.

******** They can be considered secondary canon, meaning that if there is an inconsistence, books win, if not, movie canon is fine.

Like Flitwick being a chorus teacher. It's never in the books, but it could be, so why not?

** After they meet that night for giving Harry an introduction to the sport, Harry says "it's like Basketball played on brooms with 3 hoops".

Then the book describes Wood getting this look on his face which says he's very interested. A small hint to convey Wood's manic interest in the sport

It's small moments like these which make HP enjoyable

** I always understood that as that they were a bit desperate(Slytherin had been kicking their ass for several years straight), so when someone who literally on /the first time/ they fly on broom does something that impressive, it shows natural talent. It pays off in that it's the one thing Harry is almost effortlessly superb in canon (he's supposedly powerful with magic too, but that's not as evidenced)

It's also a good way to put Harry in the spotlight and give an excuse to show Quidditch matches for a good portion of the books.
