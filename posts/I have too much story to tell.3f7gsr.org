I'm writing an epic and I have epic events to tell about... there just isn't enough time in the day to get paid for doing real work and also writing the 2-300,000 words that would be required to do justice to the plot.

This is the state of the Spiral Path.

It occurred to me after rereading DisobedienceWriter's The Valley of Kings Massacre that not all stories need to be told at the 'living it' level of detail. I could simply write up the summary of events with enough notes about the whys and wherefores to explain people's choices. Would it be better to finish the story in summary form or commit to years of struggling to pound out the path each stone at a time?

What is the greater crime? To leave the story in a struggling hiatus or to rob the reader of immersion?


** I can't help you answer that, but for the readers' sake, please write up a reasonably detailed and cleaned-up summary of what sill needs to happen, and if you ever find yourself unable to continue (or worse), post it, giving the readers some closure.

*** That would be the idea- write the summary as its own storytelling piece that still conveys the meaning of the events. It sounds like I should write the summary but not post it unless I truly lose the muse entirely.

**** You could do that! If you wanted, you could even flesh out the fun parts and summarize the stuff that bores you.

*** It's not that I don't enjoy the writing or Holly's story- usually I can bully my way through a blah chapter or two if I have an awesome scene to share. There's just a little too much blah between the beginning of Umbridge at Hogwarts to the fun point after Christmas, and then a gap of blah until we get to the crossroads chapter.

Maybe I just need to jump into writing those fun chapters and then back-write the path to get there. Usually that ends up requiring a rewrite of the fun chapter because the filling-in events deserve their own measure of cleverness- if it's boring for me, it has to be excruciating for the reader.

Skip the blah parts. Do the important parts as memories interspersed into the action, when needed, or have a summary/montage sequence covering some of the down-time. Readers don't like the 'filler' any more than writers, IMO.

**** Why not write it and take your time writing it? I have a full time job and a husband in med-school. I just write when I have the time. I started my fic in October 2013 and it's at 465,657 and it's barely half way done. And that's just the first story... I have two more after, but I love it and my readers don't mind waiting for the next chapter to come, because they understand I have a busy real life. If it's that you don't enjoy writing anymore, that's another situation, but if you love your story there's nothing wrong with just writing when you can.

And you can turn those boring chapters around. Maybe focus on character development during those scenes or other things like that. If you still enjoy your story keep at it. If it takes years, let it take years. It's a novel length fic, it's okay to take years to write it. Novels take years to write after all. AND hashing out the harder chapters will only help you improve for the more exciting ones! You could also just write those boring chapters, ask your beta how to make it more intriguing and just save them till the exciting chapter is ready. So post your other chapters with the exciting one.

You said your story was epic. To me that means you really care for it, so I just think a summary wouldn't make you feel good at the end of the day.

** I'd prefer the "better late than never" approach, myself. If I wanted to read summaries instead of stories, I'd be on AlternateHistory.com, not FanFiction.net.

** I don't know about your story, but I *hate* abandoned stories. I also *hate* when something random happens and there isn't enough build up.

I think you could just say

** If you have an epic idea and know what you want to do with your story, then take the time to get it right. Your readers will appreciate it and you'll feel happier with what you've accomplished. The downside is you have to come to terms with slower updates and having stories unfinished for awhile - This is really hard to do, but it's worth the effort/wait.

** I think robbing the reader of immersion is the worse crime, m'self. I /love/ epics /because/ of the immersion. If a story I was enjoying abruptly turned into summaries, I'd be incredibly disappointed, m'self.
