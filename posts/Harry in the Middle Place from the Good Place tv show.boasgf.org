I'm not sure what would happen, but I wish there was a fic where Harry ends up in the middle place for some reason. My best guess is the trope where he is MOD and Death is not happy and so punishes him.


** I would use the problem of the series where Harry has saved Hundreds of Thousands of people and has stop Genocide... But he also killed someone and used 2 of the Unforgivables and also 'Saved' some bad guys and thus he's in the Medium Place

Mindy St Clair Likey, Harry doesn't Likey as much
