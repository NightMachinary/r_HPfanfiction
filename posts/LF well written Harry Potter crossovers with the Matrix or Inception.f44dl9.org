What the title says. Any ships, any length, any completion status (though preferably complete).

The only ones I can think of are linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7370121/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Illusions-of-Reality]]) and linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12475856/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Blue-Pill]])

Thanks in advance!

  Harry has felt for a long time that there was something strange about the Muggle world. But when he begins receiving strange messages from the notorious mass murderer, Sirius Black, he begins to wonder if the Wizarding world is what he believed it to be. COMPLETE!

  After seeing Snape's memories in Dumbledore's pensieve, Harry realizes he has to sacrifice himself for the Wizarding World to survive. But after a very cryptic encounter with Luna Lovegood, Harry begins to question everything he knows about his life. What is really going on? Central to answering this question is finding out who truly is the Boy-Who-Lived?

** I love Budchick's Inception/HP crossover story: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6778133/1/The-Most-Resilient-Parasite-Is-An-Idea][The Most Resilient Parasite Is An Idea]].

It's marked as HP/TMR, but the fic never got far enough for any relationship to form. The existing part is well written, so I highly recommend it.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter lives at Grimmauld Place with all of his friends and family. There's Mom and Dad, Dad's friends Sirius and Remus, Sirius' cousins Andromeda, Bellatrix and Narcissa and their families, and everything is perfect. He doesn't know who Voldemort is, and he doesn't need anyone telling him to wake up. TMR/HP. Crossover with Inception.
