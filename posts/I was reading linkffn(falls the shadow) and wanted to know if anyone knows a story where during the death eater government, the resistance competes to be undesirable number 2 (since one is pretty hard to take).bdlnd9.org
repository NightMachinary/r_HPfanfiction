** You know my one and only complaint about Falls the Shadow (elsewise it is truly brilliant) is that I felt it would be both funny and more true to canon if Hermione and then later Ron (when discovered at Malfoy Manor) superseded Tobias and Kingsley in the Undersirable spot purely for association with Harry. Tobias would be hilariously frustrated.

linkffn(6726813), as it won't work in the title.

Unfortunately I don't really know anything that fits that request.

  The sequel to Shade to Shade. When Voldemort rules the ministry, homes are broken, friends are scattered, and decisions have to be made between what is right, and what needs to be done to survive.

** In my mind, I'm imagining a semi-serious attempt at this that has a /lot/ of slapstick-ish moments and would very much like to read that.

** I feel like canon Hermione would blow up the ministry with her protect Harry attitude. Set a teacher on fire, scar a student, lead a teacher to a possible demise. Yes, Hermione might blow up a ministry.
