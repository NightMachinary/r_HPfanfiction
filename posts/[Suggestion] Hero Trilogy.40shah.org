** The trilogy is quite well known, but is overshadowed by his wastelands of time. I only read the trilogy in full once, and that was when I first started reading fanfiction ~7 years ago. I enjoyed it immensely then, but every time I've tried to reread it, I just don't manage to get very far. Like, the whole idea of Gryffindor vs Slytherin transcending time and dueling with swords is kind of lame, and that sort of sets the tone for the whole thing. There is such a thing as being too epic.

However, the one thing I would take from this story is that this is one of the building blocks that the author used to eventually become a published author. His newer stuff is vastly improved and I'd buy any of his published stuff.

** I tried reading this once and just couldn't get into it. Maybe it's time for another attempt.

** Hero Trilogy is really good, especially the second book. The second book has to be one of the top fics of all time.

** The hero trilogy is a great example of just what fanfiction can do in my opinion. If you told some random oerson the big plot points that happen in the 2nd and 3rd books, it would sound ridiculous. But they worked as the story grew
