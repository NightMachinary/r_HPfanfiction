...By the way, I remember seeing a fic once which featured something like this in passing. Snape threatens to dose Neville's toad, Neville responds by casually pushing over his cauldron on purpose. I think it was one of those ones where Harry is an assertive influence on Neville, and I'm fairly sure it was on Fanfiction.net...

** I wonder if it only spilled on Snape's feet, would Snape have to walk around normal-sized but with teeny, tiny feet?

*** Or, if it only hit Snape's shoes, would only those shrink, and Snape would have to tiptoe around in teeny, tiny, itty-bitty shoes.

** Everyone knew he was clumsy, this was just the latest proof.

A minute Professor Snape glared up at him, his tiny face seething. Neville could already imagine the punishments that would be piled upon him. Detention for years, and nothing useful. Nothing that would make him better or different than he was. That wasn't the point of detention. That wasn't the point when Professor Snape mocked him in class. It wasn't the point when his gran scolded him, or when she looked like she would give anything to make Neville half of his father instead of all of himself.

The point was to punish Neville for being who he was. The point was that being Neville was a clumsy, anxious existence. That the 'nice' people just ignored him and were quietly glad that they were better off, while others cast stinging hexes at his shoes even when they're reduced to 5 inches of height.

It hurt, but in a different way than the mental hurt that he got all the time. This, at least, gave him something to focus on, rather than just being generally anxious about everything that could happen.

It was a bit like watching a bug land on you. You could just watch it. It didn't make any demands of you. If you let it bite or sting you or suck your blood, well, it honestly had hardly any effect. There was an odd sort of thrill there, too. Neville could reach out and squish the bug any time he liked, or he could have mercy and let it go. It might reach the limits of its natural life, or it might die underneath Neville's thumb. The consequences, either way, were insignificant to anyone but him. Gran would yell at him for killing a but, nor would she for getting bitten.

It was nice, Neville thought, to be able to decide things for oneself.

Another hex struck his big toe, sending a brief but sharp pain lancing through his foot.

Neville turned and his elbow struck his cauldron. The cauldron tilted and fell. It felt like it fell for minutes, but the tiny professor never looked up.

He felt something strike his shoe and saw that it now had a small red stain.

"Oops," said Neville, "sorry." The words he had said a million times came out.

Everyone knew he was clumsy, this was just the latest proof.
