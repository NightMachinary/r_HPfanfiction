One of the Reasons Dumbledore dropped Harry of at the Dursleys is so that he can grow up away from the Fame, and have a normal childhood. But why does everyone have to know that Harry is the Boy Who Lived? Saying that the Potter prepared a Trap in Case Voldemort attacked them, and killed him that way is way more plausible than a baby survived an unsurvivable curse and killed Voldemort.

Does a good story with this plot exist?


** I wondered this same thing yesterday. How did the legend of the Boy Who Lived come to be? Let's think about what happened. (I don't have the book at hand right now, correct me if I'm mistaken.)

1. Voldemort attacks the Potters in Godric's Hollow and disappears.
2. Dumbledore learns of what has happened without visiting the house and sends Hagrid to fetch Harry.
3. Hagrid fetches Harry, meets Sirius, takes his flying motorcycle, and begins to fly to Little Whinging.
4. Vernon Dursley overhears several wizards talking about Harry defeating Voldemort.
5. Dumbledore and McGonagall meet in Little Whinging, then Hagrid arrives, and Harry is left with the Dursleys. Only four people at this point have seen Harry's scar or even know for sure that he has survived.
6. Without Harry ever showing his face in the wizarding world, everyone knows he has a lightning-shaped scar because he survived Voldemort's attack.

So, how did all the wizards learn about this? The only explanation I can think of is that Hagrid stopped in every wizarding pub on the way from Godric's Hollow to Little Whinging, and showed the baby Harry to everyone. That would also explain why it took so long for Hagrid to fly such quite a short distance. (It's just over 100 miles from West Country to Surrey.)

Harry never wanted attention. His legend caused much misery to him and to those close to him. Sadly, he never learned that he had to go through it because of his good friend, Rubeus Hagrid.

*** We have to be cautious about the timeline, so here's what we know:

1. Voldemort kills the Potter late on Oct 31st.
2. Vernon goes to work, so it has to be a work day --> Monday Nov 2nd
3. Harry gets dropped off that very evening --> it's been approximately 48 hours since his parents died

I know most of this is probably irrelevant because JKR never consulted a calendar but still. I don't believe Dumbledore would get a child out of a collapsed house after an attempt on their life and never get them checked out. Also what did Hagrid do during the daytime? Keep flying Harry from wherever Godric's Hollow is to Surrey? That wouldn't take 24 hours.

**** Yeah. It's definitely plausible that Harris first took Harry to hogwarts to be checked over to make sure he was alright. And then brought to the Dursley's after they were located. After all lily probably wasn't in contact with petunia for years. It might've taken a little while for Dumbledore to figure out where they were living. Plenty of time for Hagrid to go to the pubs and blab about it all

*** Mm, it is a short time-frame for the information to spread. Unless Hagrid/Dumbledore/etc actively worked to spread the news of what happened, it'd be easy to notice Voldemort is missing (Dark Marks fading, Imperius breaking, etc), but not that Harry Potter survived.\\
 \\
Although, that's something that could happen non-magically in the modern day, thanks to smartphones. A few tweets (or since it's magic, 'hoots') about coming out of the Imperius, someone spotting the destruction of the Potter's house at Godric's Hollow, seeing Hagrid leave with Harry...

He /also/ gave away secrets about it to a mysterious rando in a bar because he was distracted by the illegal dragon egg. Rubeus Hagrid is not good at keeping secrets.

It's quite possible that Aurors watched Voldemort try to kill Harry and then the recollection gets foggy due to the powerful nature of the Magic.

Well, I'm assuming you need trace evidence to recreate it. It's likely that the Basilisk just straight up killed Myrtle without leaving a mark along with Riddle covering up his tracks to begin with.

As for who put his name in the goblet of fire, the same thing probably applies. It's far too subtle and it's probably not a spell anyone other than an Auror or probably Dumbledore /would/ know (aside from Newt Scamander who demonstrated the spell as well).

** Well, there'd need to be some explanation for the scar, but that's not so hard to manage.

I'm surprised Dumbledore didn't try to put all the credit on Lily. Publicly, I mean, not just to Harry. Not only does it shields Harry from scrutiny and celebrity, but its a nice bit of counter-propaganda to Pure Blood prejudice (a "lowly Muggleborn" defeated Voldemort).

The only reason I can think is he didn't want the actual nature of Harry's protection to become common knowledge, and crediting Lily might have helped people guess the truth, so he used "The Boy Who Lived" as a cover story. Or (for a more ruthless Dumbledore) he wanted to ensure that Voldemort would focus on Harry to fulfill the prophecy.

Lily and James gave their lives in the fight against Voldemort to ensure that the trap works, and Voldemort is defeated. To protect Harry (not necessarily in an evil Dumbledore way) Dumbledore claims most of the credit for the vanquishing to prevent Death Eater from searching revenge on Harry.

**** If the secret is worded as "The Potter family lives in Godric Hollows", as soon as Lily and James are dead the secret is no longer true (Harry alone being alive does not count as "the Potter family", he's just one person). If the secret is no longer true then the Fidelius Charm collapses. This is just my headcanon, but it explains why Snape and Hagrid, who presumably haven't been told the secret, can see and enter the house (Sirius wasn't the secret keeper but he was probably told the secret). If I'm not mistaken in the books when the secret keeper dies every person who knows the secret becomes the secret keeper, so Pettegrew dying wouldn't break the charm. In the sixth book, with Dumbledore's death (the secret keeper) the Fidelius doesn't collapse probably because the secret (the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix is in Grimmauld Place) is still believed to be true by some of the secret keepers. What I mean is that the adults in the order probably meet in some other place (so new headquarters) but for Harry/Ron/Hermione Grimmauld place is still considered Headquarters, at least until it becomes even more compromised and they abandon it.
