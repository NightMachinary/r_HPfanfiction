Hi! I was wondering if there were any really good rics where harry time travels to the marauders era and stays there as a student at hogwarts, not as a teacher. I dont mind what house he gets sorted into, but I would prefer him to be in hogwarts as I find the interaction between harry and his parents interesting. Also, where harry still has his scars. I dont mind either whether or not harry is dark/light/grey or if it is slash or not slash (or there are no pairings at all). Thank you so much!!!


** Stepping Back by The Black's Resurgence, Harry basically becomes the 5th marauder.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  After looking into Snape's pensieve, Harry makes up his mind to take charge of his actions---but before he can, he is sent back in time to 1975. He must find his own way back to the future without upsetting the time line, but the Dark Lord is on the rise, and Harry's never been good at keeping his head down.Canon Divergent after "Snape's Worst Memory" in OotP.Warnings in author's notes.
