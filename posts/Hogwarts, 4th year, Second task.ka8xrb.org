Harry was standing at the Lake with the other champions. He discovered the task only two weeks ago and there was just not enough time for him. Now, he had a big problem. Watching the waters with concerning and resigned eyes he proclaimed a bit embarrassed: "Guys, we have a problem!" The others looked with mild surprise. "What kind of problem should there be, my boy?" Dumbledore asked. "I never learned to swim..."


** This would usually be followed with...

"Do not worry my boy, Severus was a swimming champion in his very scarsely populated neighborhood. He'll tutor you."

Followed by Snape appearing in a swim suit proper of the Adam's Family.

"Profess---" Harry starts before being pushed to the water.

"Jumping to deep water is the best way to learn" Snape mutters with a sneer.

Harry trashes trying to get a breath. Snape levitates him out and rolls his eyes. "5 points from Gryffindor for almost drowning"
