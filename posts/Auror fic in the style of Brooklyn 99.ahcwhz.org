"You know what the toughest part about being a muggle-born, half-veela auror is?"

...

"The discrimination."


** "Motorcycles are death machines, I have three kids. I'm not risking it."

"Are you saying that my life matters less because I don't conform to society's heteronormative, child-centric ideals?"

You could definitely fit this in somewhere

** There's a really great Tumblr blog/trend that puts B99 quotes to Harry Potter gifs.

I would love to write a Harry and Ron as Aurors in B99 style, but I'm just not witty or lighthearted enough! But yes, the world urgently needs this.

** Lol that's a great idea. Somebody please write this. linkffn(10733593) is the closest thing I can think of, not because it's in the style of Brooklyn 99, but just b/c it's the best comedy Auror story I know of.

  What? Why was Amelia snickering? Surely it was a good thing to have such a legendary auror like Alastor Moody as a mentor... right?

*** Depends on whether or not veela count as witches. Or they could be using “half-veela” to mean “technically 1/4 veela, but look like a veela and everyone sees them as veela.”

***** The books don't specify whether “muggleborn” means “wizard born to two non-wizards” or “wizard born to two non-magical humans (muggles),” or whether non-humans who can't use magic count as muggles or not (and, if not, if there's any other terminology to differentiate them from magic-users of their species), so it's kind of a grey area. Would a /non/-wizard child born to a veela and a muggle be a squib or a (half-veela) muggle?

****** In the scene where Hagrid explains what mudblood means (book 2) and he uses muggle-borns to mean someone born to two non-magic parents. Half-veela would inherit enough veela traits to be considered magic.

******* Yeah, but... that's Rubeus “Shouldn't Have Told You That” Hagrid. I love him, but I don't know if we can assume he was thinking about cases beyond human magic-users at that moment.

******** If we had another canon source regarding the topic (we could, I don't know) then, yes, Hagrid's wording would be suspect. But when we don't have any other source, then his words have weight to them. Hagrid saying something in canon is worth a lot more than our maybe's and perhaps's.

** Now its time to play, match the "younger" characters from the show with characters from Harry's core of friends.

I guess I would go with...

- Jake = Harry
- Charles = Ron
- Amy = Ginny/Hermione
- Rosa = Ginny/Hermione
- Gina = Luna
- Terry = Neville

I really can't decide on Amy and Rosa for Hermione/Ginny lol
