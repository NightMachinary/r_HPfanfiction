I think stuck in limbo for all eternity is a close to accurate description.

*** Though, that raises the question, if they're stuck as ghosts for eternity, where are the ghosts of ancient druids? Or the dinosaur ghosts? I don't think we see a ghost that's older than the 10th century...

And if they're eternal, what about far far into the future? What if life on earth dies out and something new comes along, will human/other ghosts still be there?\\
Or what if mankind spreads to the stars, will ghosts come with them?

...Hey, there's a thought, maybe after they get bored of sticking around earth, ghosts tend to fly as high as they can. There might be tons of ghosts on the moon, or out in space, or some may have even made it to Mars.\\
Imagine that, magical astronauts making it to Mars only to discover that there's ghost dinosaurs there.

**** It's mentioned only wizards (including witches, presumably since we know there are female ghosts) can be ghosts. (For no good in universe reason, btw.) So in order for there to be dinosaur ghosts there would've needed to be dinosaur wizards.

I think the reason lies in Christian theology. That is do they believe animals have souls akin to humans? If not that's the reason. If they do, back to square one.

******** Actually that would make a good pureblood proof. Muggle dont have ghost, animals dont have ghost ergo Muggle are just smart animals.

I think ghosts occur in areas with high concentration of magic. Thus they arent common. Also, selkies and such-and-such fae are said to be spirits of the dead or were once dead humans, for all you know with enough magic they reform as something else.

*** Nick's statement really raises a lot of questions, too. As well as making death seem like kind of a dick. But the books do strongly imply they can never move on. There's no appeal or point where they can change their minds, it's just "you can move on now or never."

** To be honest, I am not entirely sure it can be said that ghosts do not move on. To me, ghosts strike me as something akin to negative photo of the living person. Like the image of the person, unchanging throughout time, but not completely the same.

I'm not sure if canon can confirm or deny this, but its possible that the wizard/witch /does/ move on, but that the ghost is left behind because of a combination of their fear of death and magic. Their innate fears inadvertently create a memory of themselves that is etched upon the magical world, and can only move on if they are able to, as ghosts, reach the catharsis they couldn't find in life.

Confirmed. Snape calls ghosts an imprint of a departed soul. It's not the soul itself - that went on to the afterlife. Nick's testimony implies that those sufficiently scared of death can 'choose' to leave behind a specter of themselves at the time of their death. It's unclear how conscious that choice is. Myrtle doesn't talk about it, and Dumbledore's speech about why Sirius, Lily, and James didn't leave one behind doesn't match up with the rumored backstory of Professor Binns.

***** It makes sense if you realize that paintings were most likely invented after ghosts, and were most most likely based upon them in some way. The mechanism that allows a ghost to imprint itself on the world was reverse engineered and added to paintings, possibly because that was the only medium that could hold them at the time, and the wizarding world doesn't really advance once they've found something that works (quills, parchment, wands, etc).

Otherwise there'd be animated statues of people walking around, but that may be too close to necromancy for wizards to be comfortable with it. Paintings would be a grey area already.

*** If this is the case, there should probably be a lot more ghosts around, particularly of non-combatants, considering three wars in relatively quick succession don't make for particularly restful deaths.

Like, children in particular have a lot of uncontrolled magic in moments of high emotion, so I imagine Voldemort targeting pre-Hogwarts muggleborns would lead to a bunch of creepy ghost children littering all of UK.

Belated Happy Halloween, you guys!

***** Yeah, but muggleborns kids don't know about what's happening. They wouldn't know anything was wrong at all until some bad people teleported into their house to hurt them. They'd be scared out of their minds and not wanting to be hurt and maybe angry too. Like Myrtle. She had no idea when she went to that bathroom to weep that she was going to die.
