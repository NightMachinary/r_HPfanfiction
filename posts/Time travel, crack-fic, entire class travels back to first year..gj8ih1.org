:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Anyone remember the fanfiction that has the entire class traveling back in time to first year? It's really cracky. I believe they perform a dance when being sorted and later on do synchronized swimming outside. I randomly want to read it again but can't find it for the life of me.

Any help is appreciated! Thanks


** I'm pretty sure it's linkffn(4655545) Réunion.
