Whatup fellow readers of fanfiction?

I have found myself out of stuff to read again and I'm in the mood for some crossovers. But I read them all, it seems. From The Havoc Side of the Force to Shadow of Angmar.

So I ask you, is there anything out there that you'd recommend that isn't a constant part of "Crossover Rec" threads?


** Well, as you've read Shadow of Angmar, I'll skip my own stuff. Some of this stuff I read a long time ago and loved, but can't remember why. Others are merely 'meh', but given the desperation of the search, well, I haven't done much filtering. I have, however, skipped the obvious ones (Browncoat, Wand and Shield, etc):

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9290216/1/Khaveyrim][Khaveyrim]] - HP/NCIS. My second favourite HP/NCIS crossover. I'll note that I've never actually watched NCIS.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10568823/1/Average][Average]] - HP/NCIS. My actual favourite HP/NCIS crossover. Neither of the NCIS fics have much in the way of magic in them, sadly. Still, they're fun.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10951863/1/The-Lonely-Company][The Lonely Company]] - HP/Hobbit. I'd classify this as 'a good start'. My second favourite HP/Hobbit crossover.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4323036/1/Gentleman-Usher-of-the-Scarlet-Rod][Gentleman Usher of the Scartlet Rod]] - HP/Cthulhu. I love this story. A lot.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11226035/1/Of-Wizards-and-Scarlet-Witches][Of Wizards and Scarlet Witches]] - HP/Avengers. Interesting premise. Never went anywhere.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11022305/1/Lost-Magic-First-Contact][Lost Magic: First Contact]] - HP/Mass Effect. Good story, very slow paced though. You need some patience to read it, and it hasn't really gotten very far into its story.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10308288/1/The-Only-King][The Only King]] - HP/GoT. Hella OP Harry. If you want some curb stomping, this is the fic for you. He's so strong that he doesn't even /need/ to do it himself.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10006313/1/Ascension][Ascension]] - HP/Mass Effect. Good story, I just wish the ending was less infuriating.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10477045/1/Harry-Potter-The-Avenger][Harry Potter: The Avenger]] - HP/Avengers. Fairly normal kb0 stuff. Pretty well written, I just wish more actual stuff happened around the romance.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10016768/1/Discordant][Discordant]] - HP/Star Wars. Very very good story. Just a pity it's abandoned, really.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8019225/1/Man-in-Fangorn][Man in Fangorn]] - HP/LotR. Interesting Idea. Doesn't really go anywhere, sadly.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163239/1/From-Savior-to-Avenger][From Saviour to Avenger]] - HP/Avengers. I have no memory of this fic...

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8410168/1/Steve-And-The-Barkeep][Steve and the Barkeep]] - HP/Avengers. Kinda like the many HP/Steve Rogers slash stories, slice of life with Harry as a barman. Only, it's not slash.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11675231/1/Shiver-me-Timbers][Shiver Me Timbers!]] - HP/Star Wars. Another interesting idea, needs a lot of polish though.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11388514/1/The-Last-Lion-of-House-Reyne][The Last Lion of House Reyne]] - HP/GoT. Very interesting idea, and not badly written. Worth a look.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10473466/1/Fate-be-Changed][Fate Be Changed]] - HP/Hobbit. Best for last. Kinda. It's not /really/ a crossover (despite calling itself one), Harry reincarnated as a Hobbit. One of my favourite stories.

*** Oh god, you rip open a very old wound with linking Discordant. Asajj is my all time favorite SW character. Her and Harry make a great team in this one.

Thanks for your recs. I'll check out every one of them.

Oh, and kudos for Shadow of Angmar. It already made its way on my all time favorite list.

  PART 2: She slayed the dragon, reclaimed the Mountain, birthed a forest, and won a war. But that was just the beginning. The past has a funny way of coming back to haunt you. Horcruxes and Dark Lords and quests to destroy them both, this time though, she's not alone. She has a Fellowship at her side.

  Because why the hell not? After all, life is a choice. Starts in NCIS series 3. It will contain spoilers, some minor some major. features a Harry working for the Muggles, who are unaware that he is a wizard. Pretty much Canon Harry until the end of book 7, big AU after that. Please read and enjoy, constructive criticism is always welcomed.

  As the Master of Death, Harry cannot be taken by time. His friends were allowed to live out their lives, while he remained unchanged until they finally passed on. With nothing left to live for in his world, he sought out a new world, where he will find new friends and more danger than he's ever been in before. Middle-Earth might never be the same again, after Harry's done with it.

  It wasn't the bright and shiny Jewel of the Galaxy you've all seen on the HoloNet. Harry's story started in the Underworld, a kilometer below the upper levels of Coruscant, where you never walk the streets alone, especially if you don't have a blaster hanging by your side. He left for a little while, but now it's called him back, whether he realizes it or not.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  Magic is about intent; so when Harry unconsciously starts pouring magic in to his cooking, he creates something magical no one can resist. At 16, despite being the owner of a 5 star restaurant, his life is normal...until Tony Stark appears with his band of misfits and refuses to leave. Gods, magic, prophecies, bonds, Harry's life will never be the same ever again. SLASH.

  Harry takes inspiration from a manga called Fairy Tail, as well as the great creation we call "The Internet". What follows is a different path taken. A path of strife, rebellion, and above all, power. Welcome to the New Age. Timeline moved to the 2010s. Eventual X-over with Devil May Cry 3, Stargate: SG-1, Smallville, Dresden Files and Ranma.

HP/Pokemon cross-over with Hogwarts being a trainers school. Up to book 4 complete. First book is amazing, then it does take a dive with Luna being the worst character i've ever read (spouting MLP references for example) but the two mythologies are well inter-twined and the world building is impressive.

  He remembers being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a beast borne of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of cold dead things. He is the second son of the king, a spare, but his fortunes change when secrets rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming, but magic is might.

  Sometimes, an average family has secrets. The residents of 1313 Mockingbird Lane have more secrets than most. Perhaps their biggest secret is how family comes first and foremost. Once he turns 11, young Harry Munster is offered a place at the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry, but he isn't interested, for four reasons. Dodgers, Dresses, Teddy bears, and Spot.
