I'm looking for a fit where Harry kills his relatives and gets sent to prison. Dumbledore finds him years later, after he's gone insane, and makes him go to Hogwarts. Harry can't be controlled and he keeps trying to cause a societal upheaval to make only the strongest survive. He ends up turning Britain into a desert wasteland.

*** Wait, has he actually posted new chapters relative to old version. The last thing I remember was him turning the country (world) into a desert? And then various pockets of students losing it.

** This reminds me of another story if anyone can help me with it. I think it starts before 5th year when they come for his wand. Tonks shows up and Harry imperius's her to fight against the order, which he feels bad about because they're friends. He gets sent to Azkaban and Dumbledore (after a while) convinces the WG to free him, believing he was possessed (or something)

  I'm sick of the manipulation, the lies and the deceit; sick of jumping to the tune of dark lords and old puppeteers. I'm cutting the strings. Innocents will pay in blood for my defiance, but I no longer care. I lost my innocence long ago. Dark!Harry
