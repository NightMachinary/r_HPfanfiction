So. Charms. You can get so creative with that stuff it's insane! Like you're in a duel and then you've charmed your opponent's robes to literally exude burning acid on the inside.

- Or you use the opposite of a canon cheering charm, like a demoralizing charm or something.

- Or a charm that makes them have all the symptoms of being drop dead drunk so they can't even stand up and they slur spells and mess them up.

- Or you charm the floor under them to be all sticky so they'd trip when they tried to move and then just get even more stuck to it with their arms when they go to push themselves up. Then you can finish them off while they're down.

- Or charm their clothes to weigh a thousand tons and just crush them down in on themselves into a ball on the floor.

Charms need to be used more in fanfiction fights dammit. Not just point of contact spell streaks, or sometimes conjuration or transfiguration. Charms is way underutilized.


** The issue with a lot of these is that any stuff which has to connect with the opponent (eg charming his clothes, dizziness) means that you have actually scored a body hit and a proper offensive spell (eg blasting, piercing or killing curse) would have yielded immediate results while the gimmick charm takes time to bring the opponent down, giving them time to injure/kill you and your friends.

Which is fine if you are just dicking around with a mate or in the DA, but against enemies fighting to kill you really have to respond in kind. Why make the floor under them sticky when you can throw a blasting curse and tear their legs apart with shrapnel? Why make them appear drunk if you can take their head off instead? Why make their clothes cumbersome if you can turn them into animals which gore them at close range, or simply put a hole through their torso? Death Eaters are pretty much a magical equivalent of the Waffen-SS and restricting yourself to non-lethal spells against genocidal fascists is a really stupid move.

Does that take away some of the magic when you are basically having a firefight with wands instead of guns/grenade launchers/artillery? Yes. But there's a reason armies use high-explosive shells instead of dropping beer over the enemy.

Tl;dr: Proper offensive spells are a must in a fight against Death Eaters, everything else is just tossing away lives needlessly.

**** If you have time to prepare it would be useful... but not as useful as getting a few machine guns (summoning, transfiguration) and setting up an ambush (and the element of surprise takes away any chance to shield). Or plant mines (be it Muggle or magical).

It gives the lesser capable people something to do... But why would you bring them to a battlefield in the first place? And if they are attacked and not capable, running would do them more good.

As for utilising terrain without notice, I think that transfiguration would be better suited, with maybe a few illusion charms to hide that (field fortifications, spike pits, hidden predators ready to jump, disillusioned venomous snakes).

#+begin_quote
  Could it make sense to use a distracting charm as a prelude to a more crushing move?
#+end_quote

Why not use something lethal as a distraction? A dark cutting curse like Sectumsempra coming your way is definitely more distracting than a leglock. Also makes for better suppressing fire.

#+begin_quote
  Similarly, might it be easier to cast a distraction charm silently, again as a means of weakening an opponent in preparation for the real fight?
#+end_quote

Might be useful for less capable people, but somehow I have the feeling that giving those an AK-47 and a few hours of marksmanship training would be more effective. Silent casting is sixth-year material and somewhat challenging, but ideally, your cast is capable of such spells by the time it comes to the finale. Otherwise, their victory will seem unbelievable. Or look like a complete asspull, like the canon one. (You can go with stealth, but I wager the guess that infiltrating Riddle Manor takes at least a similar level of competence).

***** Thanks for this -- very helpful. I especially agree with you about Transfiguration for environmental offense. I suppose I want to see the OP's point, just because that make things interesting if done well, but realistically? Yeah, I think you're right.

**** If it makes you feel any better, canonically jinxes, hexes, and curses are all considered "dark charms."

** In the very excellent fic The Second String by Eider_Down Harry has a similar epiphany and uses domestic charms in very unusual ways in duels. He also discovers the downsides for his style. linkao3(15465966)

** You know, I always wondered - if you make, say, a statue or a suit of armor move and fight for you, is that Charms or Transfiguration?
