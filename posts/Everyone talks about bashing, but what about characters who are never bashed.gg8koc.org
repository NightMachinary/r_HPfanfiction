I was reading a fic with Amelia bones and was thinking about how every fic loves her.

Others I can think of are:

Luna Arthur Daphne? Neville


** All the characters you named are fan favorites because they are mostly tame/non-abrasiveness in canon or are heavily used in fanon. It'd be like kicking a unicorn.

Especially Luna. I've read fics complaining about every character, but everyone likes Luna. Most likely cause she's the bullied weird girl and that definitely resonated with the Harry Potter kids that grew up to write fanfiction

** I've seen Neville bashing. 90% of the BWL Neville fics are "Neville is a bigger prick than Malfoy, and so far up himself that he comes out the other end"

Daphne is a glorified OC, so she's very rarely bashed because she's one of those unimportant characters that if you don't want her around you just don't add her.

Luna I've seen 1 fic that involves bashing her, because she went along with the "let's treat Harry like shit after the DOM" trope and Harry was like "Fuck you all Peace out suckaz" and left the country. Those tropes suck though. If she's not around, she's just written as some weird bullied girl in the background. If she does get bashed it's probably in the "Hermione is always right. how dare that girl believe in imaginary creatures!" sort of way by insane Hermione fanboys.

Arthur gets bashed less than Molly because he has the look of a man that isn't allowed his own opinion and that Molly only humours him by letting him play with his muggle toys. Have seen a few fics where he's in on the "Let's ruin Harry's life because we're greedy and Dumblegrumble said so" plots though.

You very rarely see Twins bashing outside of Slytherin Harry fics where they're generic bullies that "Prank" the first years and Harry stops them.

McGonagall is one of those characters that you could quite easily bash but she's given WAY too much leniency in fics as being "the most supportive teacher" without any reason for it. Even Canon Harry seems really stupid when he successfully casts a Crucio on one of the Carrows for spitting at McGonagall when she's been fucking useless the whole series, and couldn't cast it at Bellatrix who killed Sirius moments before.

  Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** I've seen Arthur Weasley bashing mostly in conjunction with Molly/Weasley-Family-In-General bashing, where he's passively going along with whatever scheme the Weasleys have cooked up. I remember one fic where he had a more active role, being the guy who smoothed things over with the Ministry and acting like a bumbling dad purely to try and get Harry to let his guard down around him.

Neville gets bashed in a few stories I know of - mostly (W)BWL stories where people think Neville's the chosen one and he goes full Malfoy with the publicity. I've also seen him used as effectively Bashed!Ron's crony.

Luna I've seen bashed in some of the more extreme Hermione-wagging fics - and then mostly in the form of her more outlandish beliefs being treated as if she belongs in St. Mungo's. She mostly just ends up not being mentioned at all if the author dislikes her as a character.

Daphne Greengrass is practically a fanon character to begin with - she gets mentioned once in the whole series. It's hard to bash a character whose entire personality is 100% fanon.

*** The reason for this probably has to do with the fact that Marauder-bashing comes from 3 major tropes: WBWL, Indy!Harry and Snape-redemption. The former 2 bashes all of the Marauders about equally much (alongside other Order members), but fics that has sympathy for Snape generally bashes James and Sirius much more than Remus. For those, Remus is usually the lesser bad person here, not really harassing him the way the other Marauders do and is usually excused with "well he's a werewolf whose only bad choice was picking bad friends" (similar to Snape, incidentally).

It was a mystery though so you didn't find out til towards the end that Neville was the one trying and failing to kill Harry and I remember getting to the end where it was Neville and being like “ummm no”. I felt like if the author wanted to go that route some more time needed to be spend on his character development in the fic, because as you said nobody hates Neville so it's really hard to accept him as the bad guy when there was no build up to it. I felt like it came out of nowhere and they just slapped the excuse of jealousy as the reason. Like I feel like it can be done turning a character everyone loves into the villain, but man you have to really work on that.

** *Saying No* - linkffn(7274734)

Amelia's makes an appearance and is promptly bashed. But this fic barely counts, since if you were over 17, you were bashed.

-

/Sometimes/ Arthur is bashed for being a bigot. I can somewhat understand the reasoning too. He works in the misuse of muggle artifact office and can't pronounce electricity. Then there's the fact the way he talks about muggles being "amazing despite not having magic" it sounds like a parent talking about their child being amazing for being potty trained. It's messed up, yes, but that's how JKR wrote him.

-

Neville is sometimes bashed in wrong boy who lived fics IF he was selected as the WBWL. Even then, I barely consider that bashing, as it shows the possibility of what could be Harry if he was raised in the magical world and pampered for being the boy who lived. But there are cases where the dial is turned up to 11/10.

-

Luna? Don't think I ever saw one. They probably exist somewhere. Maybe.

-

Daphne? There are tons of fics where she's the stereotypical Slytherin Death Eater Junior sycophant. Where she ends up dying because she was marked. But those fics could have been from before she became "popular".

** I've seen Arthur Weasley bashing but only in AU fics where he's basically Lucius Malfoy and doesn't resemble canon at all. The only member of the family I've never seen bashed is Charlie, probably because he has so little character time that you can basically just write him out of the country and be doen with it.

** I think it's got something to do with the fact that we don't know enough about them. All characters that get bashed are present enough to show traits that are differing levels of unfavourable. In other words, they're three-dimensional.

That's my theory at least
