** Adding a thought: if the babies hadn't been swapped, Voldemort would have no reason to hunt her down for a stillborn. She would be alive. So in that case Harry's existence and James' affair could be seen, from Snape's pov, as what led to Lily's murder.

** If Harry were 15, that'd mean it was OotP time and ripe time for Snape to betray the Order if he felt like it.

I think Snape would be enraged and incredibly bitter. He'd probably say some truly unforgivable things to Harry the second Harry looked at him wrong, which he would because Harry was temperamental at that age. I think it'd definitely cross his mind to betray the Order, but I think Dumbledore would talk him out of it because in the end, Lily did love Harry and she died for him whether they were blood or not. Letting Harry die now would still mean her sacrifice was in vain.

But there definitely wouldn't be a ‘look at me' moment for Snape.

*** I agree with this. Harry was a year old when his parents died, so it's not like Lily only saw the baby for a few hours and then Voldemort killed her￼.

I think the thing that changes isn't Snape; I think that the thing that changes￼ is the bond that's supposed to protect him with Lily's family. The question is whether Harry needs to have the blood of Lily's relatives in him in order to be protected, or if the fact that she gave her life and they are related to /her/ is enough￼.

*** Life debts aren't an actual thing in canon. The only thing that comes close is Harry stopping Sirius and Remus from killing Peter, saving his life. Dumbledore comments that it "put him in [Harry's] debt," but it wasn't magical or anything. It was just that Peter technically owed Harry for saving him, which caused him to hesitate later one, which led to his death.

Someone like Snape, who's already abusive towards children, including Harry, and is absolutely vile and loses control when it comes to the topic of James and Sirius (even in front of the Minister of Magic), won't give a shit about any life debt.

  “Pettigrew owes his life to you. You have sent Voldemort a deputy who is in your debt. When one wizard saves another wizard's life, it creates a certain bond between them . . . and I'm much mistaken if Voldemort wants his servant in the debt of Harry Potter.” “I don't want a bond with Pettigrew!” said Harry. “He betrayed my parents!” “This is magic at its deepest, its most impenetrable, Harry. But trust me . . . the time may come when you will be very glad you saved Pettigrew's life.”

Life debts are an actual thing in canon. We do not know for sure however if Snape had a magical bond to James, or just felt he owed him.

And Snape absolutely gives a shit about the debt.

  “And then your father did something Snape could never forgive.”“What?”

  “He saved his life.”

  “What?”

  “Yes...” said Dumbledore dreamily. “Funny, the way people's minds work, isn't it? Professor Snape couldn't bear being in your father's debt...I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even. Then he could go back to hating your father's memory in peace.”

  Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he stopped.

***** So you're just going to repeat what I said and use that as evidence against me? The hand didn't kill Peter because he had a "life debt." It killed him because he hesitated and considered betraying Voldemort by allowing Harry to escape. This was cause by his life being technically saved by Harry, yes, but the actual death wasn't because of any magical debt. If Peter had this "life debt" but completely ignored it and not hesitated, then he wouldn't have been killed by the hand.

Despite these two circumstances resulting in the same thing, the actual mechanics behind each situation is completely different. One is that there's actually a magically enforced debt that appears when one's life is save by someone. Another is that a series of circumstances led to Peter's death, which started when his life was saved.
