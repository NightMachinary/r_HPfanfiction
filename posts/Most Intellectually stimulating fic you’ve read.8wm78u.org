*** Standard Disclaimer to anyone reading the fic:

The author's goal is to take a bog-standard, clichéd, WBWL fic and subvert its elements. The only problem with this is in order to subvert clichés, you need to establish them. So the first half/three-quarters of Year 1 is a very standard, very clichéd run-of-the-mill fanfic.

After about 3/4 of year 1, the fic suddenly explodes in quality and gets very good very fast. But it's a necessary slog.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord.

** Linkffn(Emperor by Marquis Black) is a political, military fic of epic proportions.

Linkffn(The Fifth Element) is thoroughly researched and meticulously written. I've learnt a fair amount just from his footnotes.

Linkffn(Out of the West) is unique, and reads more like original SF than Harry Potter fan fiction. The author clearly knows what he's writing about.

Linkffn(Shadow of Angmar) displays an amazing knowledge of the Middle Earth universe. If you couldn't tell, I enjoy stories that are well thought out and from authors that really know their canon.

For what it's worth, I am disappointed in the fact that I've never stumbled onto a HP fanfic that delighted me in its knowledge of canon like I have in the ASOIAF or Star Wars fandoms. Maybe there's just less EU to Harry Potter and the world is a smaller scope than these others.

*** There is definitely far less of an EU in comparison to ASOIF, Star Wars or even Star Trek. However, i think that what is out there in the EU is also greeted with mixed reactions as well, which is why any fics with a large amount of expansive knowledge is mostly the authors own worldbuilding- from magical structure, to the wizarding world setup, to wizarding history. So much is left up to the author.

**** Sure! Each of the stories I've listed is better written than most Harry Potter fanfiction I've read, possibly because ASOIAF is an older skewing fandom. I shy away from slash and SanSan fics in general, so there may be gems I've missed there.

Robert's Rebellion timeframe:

linkffn(The Dragon of Duskendale) is about the Targaryen family, even if it takes place in the recent past.

linkao3(7851319) is a time-travel fic with Jon meeting his parents.

linkao3(3760582; 1824559) are Rhaegar/Lyanna stories. Slow-burn romances with politics and war in the background.

Canon timeframe:

linkao3(8165489; 1206619) are Jon Targaryen wish-fulfilment stories, more or less. The politicking is still interesting in both, and like the rest of the fics on this list still well-written.

linkao3(734654) is a decent-to-good story that is Jaime- and Sansa-centric, with good character development.

Linkffn(A Coat of Gold) is a Lannister-centric continuation of canon from the Purple wedding.

Linkffn(The North Remembers) is probably the definitive ASOIAF fic, being written before much of the show had come out and the fandom had exploded in growth.

linkao3(8346424) is probably the best ongoing story I'm reading, and is being actively updated. Features characters paying for (and sometimes learning from) their mistakes.

Crossover/Other:

linkao3(Sean Bean Saves Westeros Book 1) is mildly hilarious, paints a wonderful picture of Sean Bean, who is perhaps in this story even more of a Northerner than Ned. Also quotes quite a bit from Shakespeare. It's quite rare to read a story with an actor as the protagonist actually using his acting skills, and this story does that well. This story was also a pain to find without favourites-crawling as it's listed under ASOIAF/GOT crossovers...

My two favourite HP/ASOIAF fics are unfortunately incomplete and likely abandoned. For posterity's sake: linkffn(11098283; 11388514).

Finally, my search settings on AO3 are:

  The Targaryen's have a history of madness, and no one knows it better than Aelor, second son of the Mad King. Amidst his father's erratic and destructive behavior and his elder brother's decision to run off with a girl who wasn't his wife, it will take every ounce of his Targaryen charm and skill at arms to save the greatest dynasty in Westeros...and that still might not be enough.

  Mel's first ever resurrection attempt goes a little wrong and poor old Jon finds himself being catapulted back in time. However, there's a rhyme and reason behind R'llhor's madness and Jon has an important mission to fulfil before he can return to his own time, ready to win the war for the dawn and defeat the Knight's King. For Jon's "resurrection", I've gone with the show simply because we haven't yet seen it in the books. The rest is a mix of book and show verse.Time slip stories have long been a favourite of mine, no matter how cliché they are at times. Naturally, I've always wanted to dabble in one myself, so here it is. As always, none of this is mine. GRRM and HBO own all. This isn't meant to be overly serious, or anything like that. It's just me experimenting with different story concepts. Thanks again and enjoy.

  Still unmarried and unbetrothed, Prince Rhaegar Targaryen is urged to find a bride at the tourney at Harrenhal. With King Aerys growing more unhinged as each day passes, the Dragon Prince must secure his line in order to overthrow the Mad King. Lyanna Stark is chosen to wed the prince, much to her displeasure, and must leave the North to play princess with the dragons. But she quickly learns that the fire burns deadly in the royal family, and winter has no place in King's Landing. Hell, she finds, is empty and all the devils are at Court. COMPLETED

#+begin_quote
  King Aerys Targaryen's extreme paranoia delays Rhaegar's betrothal to Elia Martell until he is twenty-two. But when the King suspects the Starks of plotting against him, he breaks the betrothal to promise his eldest son to the noble house's only daughter, Lyanna Stark.The arrangement does not sit well with either party. The fourteen year old Lyanna resists her cage and her new husband; the older Rhaegar finds himself discomforted by her immaturity and willful nature. The king's madness worsens, and intrigue further interrupts the already volatile atmosphere of King's Landing.In the North, Brandon's reckless behavior puts him, and Ned, in an uncomfortable situation, while thousands of miles south, the Martells stews over the insult paid to Elia. Somewhere in the middle, a storm lord still desires the girl he was meant to have while a lioness plots her way into power.orLyanna marries Rhaegar and everything happens except love at first sight.
