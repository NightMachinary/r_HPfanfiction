:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I only remember a few details. The ones I'm sure of are

- Definitely Harry/Fleur
- Harry is a little... not mentally disturbed? But he goes through bouts of manic (insert hobby). It might have been painting?

The details I'm not sure of, might have mixed up with a different fic

- More skilled Harry, Dumbledore has taken a more active interest
- Bill is a bit derogatory towards Fleur, Harry takes offense
- 4th year

It's been on the tip of my tongue/brain for what feels like months, any help would be appreciated.

Sadly, it's abandoned. Like really abandoned, I was his beta and he deleted the google drive files he shared

**** Haha, I can't take that much credit, my biggest contribution was cleaning up the grammar - his first language wasn't English. And even then I came in pretty late, I think just the last couple of chapters. And no, he didn't really give me a reason, I was just flowing through my google drive and saw the folder was deleted. I signed on for a lot of the reasons you've mentioned, I thought it was a fantastic story and wanted to help out any way I could

***** I get that i feel the same when i find a fic i really like it's an incredible feeling that made me want to read more fanfics, i just wished there was more of such quality and complexity, developing the characters in unique ways making us feel more attached to the characters.

  There have been many rumours surrounding me and my life---especially my love life. So, after due consideration---and a few well-aimed words from our resident bookworm---I have decided to publish my autobiography. For any questions and questionable charms placed on your copy of my self-updating autobiography, feel free to owl my publisher, Jaime.
