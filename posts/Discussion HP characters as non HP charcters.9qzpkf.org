Inspired by yesterdays post asking for Howls moving castle AU. How would you describe HP charcters as characters from other Media ? For example young snape seems like a less slick Kylo Ren without the Romance part. Harry has similarities with Jesus, as the saviour of wizardkind coming back from the dead. The Weasley Twins are kinda like a mix between Heath Ledgers Joker and Tigger from Winnie Poo. Any other ideas?


** Hermione sometimes reminds me of Seven of Nine. While often invaluable to the plot and insightful, she can also be quick to resort to extreme measures, can be socially inept and has no issues with violence.

James is like the "I will buy you time" soldier in any war movie.

*** That is one of the most unexpected yet accurate descriptions of James that I have ever read. I tip my hat at you sir

*** I am howling with mirth. James as the personification of the heroic wartime figurehead could be one intention of JKR with his character but this fits super well as is.

(The Voyager reference has me rolling too.)
