Pretty sure it's a comedy fic. I mean obviously.


** Pretty sure the fic is called “Knowledge is Power”. There are multiple fics with this name however. In the fic you are looking for Harry is two years older, raised by Remus, plays guitar for some reason, and is sponsored while he plays professional Quidditch while attending Hogwarts.

**** Yeah, it was one of the first fanfics I ever read. I'm sure I would be more bothered by the edgy Harry bits were I to read it again years later. It was my first case of desperately wishing for a story to be revived as well :(

***** Is Rising to power by demiwitch98 an adopted version? It sounds very similar.

****** Just checked it out. I think it may be more of a reimagining of the original. It seems to start at Harry's first year, but it explains him already learning occulumency before he even goes to Hogwarts, something that happened later in the original.

  Harry is 2 years older, Neville is BWL and things are way more interesting. Follow Harry as he rises to a prominent place in the wizarding world. Full of humor and of course a badass Harry this story is bound be thrilling. Disclaimer: Harry Potter belongs to JK Rowling and will never be mine. This is for the whole fanfiction.
