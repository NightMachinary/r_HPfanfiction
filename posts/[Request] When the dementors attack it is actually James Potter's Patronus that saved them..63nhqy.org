** Idea: James Potter was stunned by Voldemort than transported to the Malloy basement, where he was brainwashed through repeated usage of the imperious /cruciatus (if he fought the imperious he was crucioed, when he didn't fight it he was given a cheering charm or smth) and obliviate. He was used as a torture toy/gift in waiting for voldemort /willing weapon. Then comes his ultimate task. Killing Harry Potter. Except he doesn't. He saves him instead, then runs away because he has started to realize who he is and what he's done.

I call it Harry Potter and the Winter Wizard.

** So James was alive the whole time? Considering Lily's death was the only essential one for defeating Voldemort, I could see James getting stunned by Voldemort downstairs before the confrontation with Lily. Logistically his survival makes sense. I can't see why he would leave Harry to the Dursleys, though, or let Sirius rot in jail. Since Voldemort's defeated and most Death Eaters in jail, he doesn't really have a motive for leaving Harry. Maybe if he was in a coma.
