** Take a look through this thread and it's predecessor (linked inside): [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7ymqb6/my_hermione_timetravel_compendium_of_the_last/?st=jf0sij82&sh=9b008c52][My Hermione Timetravel Compendium]]

Some highlights:

Harry Potter era: Six Pomegranate Seeds is the best currently updating fic in general in my opinion. Hermione is reincarnated as a pureblood Rosier and sorted into Slytherin, living alongside her original self in the original timeline. She's too busy to be interfering with the stages of canon, but it's all coming to a head at the moment. really fantastic! linkffn(12132374) Not a spy exactly but pretends to be a pureblood fundamentalist, as this is what would be expected of her. This author also has very good other stories, including timetravel with Hermione/Theo that is fantastic.

Marauders era are almost always an excuse to bring her togther with Severus and to a lesser extent Regulus. So let's try something else: a Lucius pairing but very well done. Bonds Between lost souls and its sequel. She goes into Slytherin to fix the house and makes the normal followers less likely to follow, or at least less enthusiastically. She gets a little dark occasionally, basically a spy next to voldemort! Linkffn(11758961; 11975546)

Riddle era: Champion. Of course it's a Riddle pairing - these almost always are, either that or she becomes Voldemort's mum (and usually fails - have you noticed that?), It's completed now and I can definitely recommend it. yes, the Hermione/Tom relationship is sometimes a little bit sappy, but there is good genfic alongside it and, importantly for you, a lot of spying (not against Tom though). linkffn(11790377)

There are a LOT more out there. Filterwise, at least on ffnet, it helps to include at least one slytherin character in your search, because although it /has/ happened that she gets together with Sirius or whatever after being sorted into slytherin back in time, that is rarely the case.

Also, there are decent slytherin spy Hermione fics without timetravel, such as sleeper. linkffn(11867729)

*** I second Six Pomegranate Seeds - Seselt is an amazing author!

Nihil est ab Omni Parte Beatum is also a really good time-travelling Theomione where Hermione is put in Slytherin House during the Marauder era. linkffn(11735486)

  The war is much larger, far longer, and much deeper than they could have imagined: fought on a scale that baffles the limits of human understanding. In such a world, perhaps it isn't surprising when Hermione Granger is sent back in time to rescue Tom Riddle's soul before he has the chance to destroy it. Rated M.

  When blackness overcame her senses, Hermione knew she had failed. It was game over. However, while she had never been sure of what to expect of the other side, a twenty-years-in-the-past Hogwarts surely hadn't been it. Now, with the chance to change the future, Hermione must choose her moves carefully while trying to avoid the one she wishes to see the most.
