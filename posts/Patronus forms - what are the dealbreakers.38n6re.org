Not sure why this struck me, but for the longest time I've had a huge problem with magical creature Patronus forms. Of course, once I stopped ignoring the fact that Dumbledore's is a phoenix, I had to consider the possibility that such a phenomenon could indeed happen to others. After all, while Dumbledore is a genius, his magic is not "special"... as far as we know.

One could argue that his Patronus wasn't always a phoenix. Maybe it changed upon his meeting Fawkes, or after some traumatic event (or both).

So y'all: there anything about a Patronus' /form/ (rather than its /function/) that will make you nope right out of a fic?

This /could/ be a thing, to be honest. If Harry became so apathetic without the danger of being Kissed, and somehow gained solace from the presence of Dementors (non-Beings though they are), then just maybe... yeah, I'm reaching, but still. Not sure about Dementors having souls, though - hence the non-Being classification.

Nice little plot bunny here. Adalbert Waffling's Fundamental Laws of Magic strongly warn against tampering with the soul: a rule to be broken, but a rule nonetheless.

I'd like to think that witches and wizards have made great strides towards the more metaphysical aspects of Alchemy - that is, the transformation of the soul - and in their pursuit of that goal, they discovered how dangerous it is to tamper with.

Is there really any proof for that? All we really know is that nobody to go through has ever come back, so I feel like it could also be an unreliable narrator thing in the sense that the veil is only believed to be a gateway to death, and as such is passed onto the reader as fact.

**** I read a theory somewhere where it doesn't make sense for dementors to want your happy memories, but your sad and desolate ones. Why else would they go after Harry so much more in POA than someone like Hermione who would have had much more happy memories for them to feed on. That and a patronus DRIVES AWAY a dementor. They are literally fleeing from happy memories. Isn't that why they thrive so well in Azkaban? Those people in there are crazy and have done plently of horrible things for dementors to feed on! That's probably why Sirius could survive "doggy style" dogs are super happy creatures and the dementors didn't want to bother? maybe I'm streching it here but...

** There are only two forms that make me "red X" immediately:

- Human Patronus (most commonly a love interest)

- Golden Patronus

Incidentally, I don't think there's anything special about Dumbledore's Patronus being a phoenix. The form of the spell doesn't determine its power, it's merely a reflection of the caster's concept of guardianship. So far as we know /from the books/, all corporeal Patronuses are of equal power, which is to say that they have complete power over any number of Dementors. No one is ever surprised that Harry's Patronus was able to repel so many Dementors in PoA, they're simply surprised that he was able to cast one in the first place. It's only the movies that mess around with the mechanics of the spell.

Yeah - that was my understanding as well, also confirmed by Illyius' mouse Patronus according to Pottermore. Funnily enough, the same article implies that wizards themselves are similarly prone to the misconception that a larger/more dangerous animal equates to a Patronus.

As for Golden Patronuses... I think I've read one of these before, but forgot the title. Out of curiosity, where did you come across it? I'd kinda like to know the "reasoning" behind it.

**** Golden Patronuses used to be a staple of the fandom. I can't point one fic out to you, because they used to appear in almost every fic. The general idea was that Harry put his "Power He Knows Not" feelings of love into the Patronus and, powered by love rather than a happy memory, the Patronus would take on a new golden form that could kill Dementors rather than repel them.

I agree with this because it makes sense, but then I just don't get why Hermione has an otter and Ron a jack Russell terrier. Cho a swan? So I'm thinking maybe Hermione felt most loved and protected when she went to a zoo one time and saw some otters standing in between her parents? Maybe Ron had really go safe subconscious memory of some dog? It is confusing to me.

**** This wouldn't be a case of the actual animal having meaning for the caster, but instead a reflection of the protective spirit which that person would trust to save them. Ron's Jack Russell might represent his father the inquisitive tinkerer or maybe his great-uncle who taught him to play chess.

I can easily imagine Cho's swan being a representation of her mother or some other woman of significance in her family- adaptable to water, earth and air; full of grace and power though slow-moving until needing to take flight.

Hermione's otter might be meaningful from her knowing a playful person that came to represent hope for her (maybe even Tonks, but more likely a general Weasley+water totemic savior). Honestly I would have expected Hermione's to be a cat, but that might have been too suggestive of unspoken Granger-McGonagall feelings. JKR mentioned choosing the otter as being another example of her favoring the mustilidae- the Weasleys, from Ottery-St-Catchpole, with a pond and a hobby farm representing safety and isolation from the pressures of the city... if you wanted protection from depression and hopelessness, a safe home amidst a lively family would be a powerful haven.

***** I've always figured that one couldn't cast a Patronus if your soul was tainted by a large well of hate. (Rather than a well of happiness/love that you draw from to cast it.) This (headcannonly) is why Sirius doesn't have a Patronus, nor does he try and cast one. He's too embittered and hate-filled from his family, the war, Azkaban, etc. Snape didn't completely consume himself; which is why he still has Lily's rememberance as a Patronus. (It was his one ray of light; where as Sirius sort of became his hatred. All other DE's couldn't cast a patronus; and the only member of the Order who came into regular Dementor contact, couldn't cast it.)

Did you just say that Snape is happier than Sirius? That Snape has a 'ray of light' by knowing he is the reason he got his love killed? That Sirius doesn't have a 'Ray of light' in the form of Harry, Remus and his cousin Tonks?

I'll give you the fact that Azkaban might have handicapped him in a special way making him unable to cast a patronus but saying that Sirius is consumed by hatred is bullshit.

That and his hate for Pettigrew and desire for revenge. Thirteen years around Dementors would rob nearly anyone of any semblance of hope; and consequently, make /the very thought/ of those things psychologically painful due to the associations the Dementors force in your mind when they feed.

Snape couldn't let go of his childhood love for Lily; even if he knew that she didn't feel the same way, or if he was guilt tripped forever for getting her killed inadvertently. It's because he refused to let go of the small point of light that gave him a patronus.

**** I believe that the form of a Patronus is extremely complicated. I have no idea on how it works but What we do know is that it is based on the caster. Every normal person has multiple personality aspects which influence the form, some feelings have a bigger impact than others.

Harry's feeling of safety from his father's animagus form, his desire for family and just like deer he prefers to be in a group, to not be alone. These points are the cornerstones of Harry's character and that is reflected in his patronus. Tonks her depression and love about Remus caused her patronus to change because her entire life was centred around Remus at that time, it would have probably changed back once her life regained some depth.

I believe this is the case with every patronus, normally it's a combination of every aspect of your character but an obsession can temporarily change that. Once you get over the obsession it changes back.

Snape is simply wallowing in self pity and hate and thus got never over his Lily obsession which is rather creepy if you ask me.

** reading c'est la vie right now and Harry has at least two patronus forms. I haven't exited yet but one was noted as non-magical and one as a magical form so I kind of get the feeling that it is special somehow. I Rolled my eyes. It may not be the case but if not then there is no point in having it except to make him (even more) special. So just a bad sign or choice (unless, which i doubt, it is given some good reasons later).

Though your post did make me rethink a little since I hate magical animals being used (but phoenix and werewolf iirc prove that it isn't special). Also regarding double patronus forms I have revised somewhat in that it may be possible depending on the memory used (ex. Lily survives and casts a patronus with the memory of Harry flying like a hawk and has a hawk patronus while conceivably she could use a different memory of James that is still powerfully happy and have the doe). Of course I can't recall a good use of either as they are both used as a crutch for extra power or just making whoever extra super special.

TLDR- multiple forms and special magic forms for no reason or with extra powers may not make me quit that second but they're certainly a contributing factor in dropping a fic (or at the very least will lower my opinion).

** I think a patronus represents someone who you trust to protect you.

Lovers' patroni become representative of their partner I believe. Dumbledore's was a phoenix because of his great attachment to Fawkes, and Fawkes /did/ save his life during... was it the battle in the ministry where Fawkes ate the Killing Curse?

Younger children's patroni are generally their parents (Harry's being Prongs despite the fact that his father was dead) and if the caster is self-sufficient, believing they need nobody, then it will represent themselves.

Patroni will change sometimes as well. Due to the fact that it is stated "There is no way to determine your animagus form before doing it" (it did say that, right?) I am under the impression that your patronus changes to match your form /after/ you have acquired the skill. This is seen in McGonagall's patronus being the same as her animagus form.

So if, for example, you had a powerful emotional attachment to your Ol' pal, Gladys the Dementor, then theoretically, your patronus may take the form of a dementor. Wouldn't that be a sight.

Did I miss anything?

EDIT:

I just had a revelation. What if your form was a [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Demiguise][demiguise]]? It would be invisible and super sneaking, people would think that /you/ were dementor-proof.
