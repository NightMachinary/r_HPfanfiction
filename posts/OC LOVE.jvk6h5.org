Don't downvote pls.

I have been reading stuff on Quotev. It isn't better than Fanfiction.com or Archive of our own, but its good. Most of them aren't completed, but there's so many good Marauder's Era fanfics, it's amazing. You know what's more amazing? OCs. There are soooo many OC stories there, not Reader Inserts but OCs, that I am exploding with joy. Because many popular ships, I don't like. Won't mention here, because I don't want to hurt anybody. I know that if somebody said to me that LunaxRolf was necessarily BAD, I would feel sad.

And so, I am pleading for OCs, not Hermione time traveling trope, but */OCs/* that fit any of the following categories:

â€‹

Marauders Era: Love Triangle or Square between a 5th Marauder girl and the Marauders.

Golden Trio Era: Harry meets a kind, beautiful pureblood raised in a Slytherin family on Hogwarts Express. They've been unseperable BFFS since.

Marauder's Era: 5th Marauder Romance. Not Love Triangle.

Golden Trio Era: Ravenclaw or Slytherin Harryx Ravenclaw or SlytherinOC who is sort of the mothering type.

Golden Trio Era: 4th Golden Quartet Member and Harry romance.

Golden Trio Era: Draco Harry OC Love triangle, preferrably Ravenclaw or Slytherin,where Harry eventually wins!

Golden Trio Era: There is no Golden Trio, just Harry and OC. BFFs. Period.

Golden Trio Era: Slytherin Protective Harry. Not possessive, just protective. Powerful Harry, then yay!

Also, I would prefer it if the OC wasn't like the girl-who-lived. Thanks much!


** I don't know why you're being downvoted, I guess the hate for OCs is strong in this fandom lol

I'm writing a WIP with two OCs in it, it's loosely similar to that prompt you wrote above about the Golden Trio not existing, but it's more like Harry is friends with lots of people instead of only Ron and Hermione.

Hope you can enjoy it! Leave whatever concrit/feedback you have too, I appreciate any kind of comments that can help me get better.

*** I really enjoyed it!

I think this will become an amazing fanfiction. I hope so...It doused all of my OC boredom for a while! I guess people really do hate OCs. That's alright though! I just need recs!

** You're right that there aren't a ton of great OC romance fics of Ffn, and even fewer that actually hit your requests.

But there are a LOT of fics out there with characters we know nothing/next to nothing about who could fit this role. Haphne fics especially can fit two or three of your prompts about slytherin or ravenclaw Harry. And (despite jokes to the contrary) Daphne is essentially an OC, the only things we know about her are that she's a Slytherin in Harry's year and that she has a younger sister. There's more background on pottermore, but it's not like fanfic is inherently faithful to that. If you just absolutely hate some of the tropes that are associated with her (and I get that) I'd recommend similarly background characters from ravenclaw and slytherin and see if there's anything you like

*** Nah! I love Haphne. I completely agree, there's nothing we know about her. From my memory, I don't even think she was mentioned in the books. I don't know why I requested these specific prompts, they just came up in my head, and I've been trying to imagine their plotline. So, thank you for any recs!
