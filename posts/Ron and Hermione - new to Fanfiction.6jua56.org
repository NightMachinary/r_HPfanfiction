Hi, as someone who loved the book series from 'Pivot Lane' to 'All was well.', I always loved the passion and growth of Hermione and Ron's relationship, I was just wondering if people could recommend to me their favourite Ron/Hermione stories, from the small time I've had, I've learnt so much about how talented some of the writers are in the fandom and I would love to continue based of peoples personal opinions.

So far, I've read 'Australia', 'To know you is To love you' and 'The Price of Love'.


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), is my favorite R/Hr fic.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  Hermione tries to talk herself out of liking a particular idiot boy the way teenage girls have been doing since time immemorial: she makes a For & Against List. All the reasons we love Ron Weasley in handy list form!
