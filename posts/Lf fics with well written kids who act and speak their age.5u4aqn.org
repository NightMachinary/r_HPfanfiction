** I think Alexandra Quick is a good example of people acting like children while speaking like real-life adults. The problem is that most children 12 and under speak in a way that readers might find horribly grating, but speaking like written adults provides too much dissonance. Speaking like real-life adults is, I find, a good balance between the "unrealistically perfect diction and expression" of literary adults and the "unpleasant and unrealistically terrible expression" of real-life children.

(As always, this is using the most common as a standard. HPMoR's "He sounded like someone from a book" is one of my favourite lines of any series, given how children who learn to communicate from books and formal teaching from adults rather than primarily from peers tend to have that mode of speech that some readers decry as unrealistically adulty.)
