Look, I appreciate how hard it must be to write a quality fic. But in the ones set in Hogwarts can the characters go somewhere else other than Hogsmeade? Do they have to wait for a Hogsmeade weekend to go on a date? And do we always have to do the love potion lesson where the character wonders what the mysterious third scent is?

Probably the most amusing Madam pudifoot scene that I've seen (besides the canon version itself, which is classic) is when Ginny falls asleep in a critical moment in Ginny and the Half-Blood Prince. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/11/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince]]


** The places where characters can go on a date are very limited. They are at a boarding school so anywhere offsite is out of the question, other than Hogsmeade, which leaves the characters with broom closet rendezvous (not exactly romantic), The Black Lake (which is probably freezing for most of the year), and the Room of Requirement which is honestly super lazy.

It works once, but it lacks inspiration.

I do agree with you, but the choices really are not particularly great to begin with

*** Most of the school probably doesn't know about the room of requirement and I would guess that not too many know how to get to the kitchens.

**** After 5th year I would argue that the majority of the school knows about the room of requirement. And the kitchens would make an awful date.

Maybe somewhere you would go to with your SO to relax and hang out or something... but not for a date.

** Where else do you want them to go? They're in a boarding school, they're not allowed to get off the grounds during the term except during the school-sanctioned trips to Hogsmeade.

** Well, a boarding school and underage kids kind of limits where the class can go.

However, Rowling made 17 the age of majority in Magical Britain, AND she made it so that the entire 7th year were at least 17, so the entire year is composed of adults.

So, I just had Harry be the first one to figure it out in a while.

Harry asks Daphne Greengrass out for a second date. She says she is tired of Hogsmeade, to which Harry says, no problem and apparates her away.

â€‹

Every color in the universe swam before Daphne's eyes until they coalesced into the blazing green of the eyes of Harry Potter. His hands on her waist kept her upright. She found she could breathe again. Breaking his grasp she stumbled backward a step.

"Bloody Hell Potter, what did you do? Where are we?"

"We're at the Apparation Point in Glasgow's Queens Street train station."

"Why did you bring me here? We aren't allowed to leave Hogsmeade! You're going to get me expelled! What the bloody hell were you thinking about?"

"In the order you asked. I brought you here to do some shopping in a place you don't know. We are both adults and can leave the school any time we want and remain completely within the rules. You aren't going to be expelled, and I was thinking that you might enjoy seeing someplace new and completely outside your experience. You did ask me to surprise you, but if it really bothers you, I'll take you back."

"We can leave Hogsmeade?"

"Because we're over 17, yes. The staff doesn't advertise that fact, but it is within the rules."

"What are we doing here?"

"I put a lot of thought into showing you a good time." He took her hand and led her off the apparition point to one of the benches that lined the spacious room. "You were saying that after three years there was nothing in Hogsmeade that was new. I figured that the same could be said for Diagon Alley. But then I asked myself, what were the chances you had ever gone Muggle?"

Daphne's breathing had calmed. She wasn't quite as angry any longer. "You're sure that this isn't going to get me expelled?"

He nodded. "Not even killed" Her eyes widened. "Sorry, a bad joke from first year. We're perfectly safe, and not in any trouble. If Dumbledore trumps up any rules to try and punish you, just claim I took you against your will. There's no trace of your magical signature in the apparition, and I'm a well-known malcontent."

"Oh Harry, you idiot." Daphne closed her eyes for a moment. "What is there to do in the Muggle World?"

"Not much. Shopping, restaurants, dancing."

"I like shopping." She said with a hint of a smile. "I've never been to a restaurant."

"The shops are waiting for us." He stood and offered her his hand. "When did I become 'Harry'?

"You scared me almost to death, I wasn't in my right mind Potter." She pushed him. "Where are these shops you were talking about?"

Harry led her to the door of the apparition point. The door opened out into the train station. After the door closed, Daphne looked back to see what appeared to be a maintenance closet. She had never seen so many people, all bustling back and forth, not an obvious wizard or witch in sight. She held on to Harry's arm and pulled tight to him. "Are we safe here?"

"Of course we are," Harry said quietly. "Come on Daphne, Hermione told me you were in her Muggles Studies class; these aren't 12th-century peasants willing to burn people different than themselves at the stake. They're just people. Some are bad, most are fairly decent folk. These days they just shun people different than themselves and write scathing letters to the Editor of their favorite newspaper about sending those 'freaks' back where they came from. I'll not let anything happen to you. Just keep holding on to my arm like that and you'll look like my girlfriend."

"Are you sure no one will recognize you? I mean, you're famous."

"Not here. No one here knows me from Adam, just the way I like it." They had reached the station exits and stepped out to the busy sidewalks and the even busier streets. Daphne gasped at the traffic. "Take it easy, those are just autos. Stay out of their way and you're perfectly safe."

"But there are so many people"

"Yes, Glasgow's a fairly big city." Walking with Daphne clinging to his arm was a very different experience. "So what kind of shopping do you like?"

"Tracey and I usually got for our school robes and other clothing. I could use some quills."

"Well, robes never really caught on in the wider world, and I don't think anyone's used a quill for about a century. Let's see what else there is." Harry guided her into a pedestrian shopping district. "I spent a few weeks in Glasgow this summer. I got to know parts of town fairly well." Harry was jerked to a stop when Daphne suddenly halted in her tracks staring at a display window.

"What is this?"

"It's just a shoe shop."

"You mean this entire shop is for shoes?"

"I think they sell other leather goods like purses and handbags, but yes, it's a shoe shop. There are probably half a dozen on this street alone." Harry was confused, why the interest in a shoe shop?

"We need to go in there," Daphne said, her eyes wide. "We need to go in there right now."

"Alright." Harry smiled. A shoe shop? Why did she need to go to a shoe shop? Ah well, how long could it take?

  A rewrite of 'Harry Potter and the Marriage Contracts' done to improve some of the story elements, cut down on the Weasley bashing, and generally make a bit more sense. The changes are minor, but I believe make for a better story.

**** Most of the girls I've known in my life like shoes, her reaction is a slight exaggeration of the delight my wife shows whenever she finds a new shoe store.

Me, I've got three pairs of shoes. My 'good' sneakers, a pair of oxfords for when I have to wear a suit, and my 'yardwork sneakers' which are last year's 'good sneakers'. This was fairly normal for men of my generation.
