  Her father had told Harry that if Hermione was in danger he should hold that box in front of her and push the button. He'd never have expected that a series of flashing lights would transform Hermione into "Spygirl". Fortunately, the dozen Death Eaters facing them hadn't expected that either. Harry Potter/Spyboy crossover.

** Not genetically enhanced, I don't think, but definitely subjected to (awful) experiments, I know [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4231080/chapters/9569928][Weapons of Dark and Light]], but the last update was last year.

Also relevant, it's a crossover with X-Men.

  Beaten, brainwashed, and broken, the boy once known as Harry Potter is transformed into Weapon IX, a monster of terrible power and inhumanity. Designed as the ultimate foil to the Mutant Menace, Weapon IX's destiny becomes intertwined with that of the X-Men as the darkness in the hearts of men proves that, sometimes, the only way to fight a monster is with a monster.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.
