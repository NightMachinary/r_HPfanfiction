Especially the Golden Trio. I would like one where they realise that Dumbledore's tactic: "let's try to redeem them." Does not work and have to get serious since "If the death eater kills us without remorse why shouldn't we do it too? To hell with being the better person, the only thing 'trying to redeem them' produced is the chance for them to escape and continue killing people.

Edit: It seems I read too many fanfictions. Dumbledore doesn't try to redeem them. But the golden Trio can still have a moment where they realise they have to get a lot better and start killing the death eater.

*** It seems the only Death Eater he's explicitly interested in redeeming is Draco Malfoy, who is 16-years-old and a student in his charge, and Dumbledore senses (correctly) that his heart isn't into it. Although that does get a little absurd, since Malfoy deserves to die more than Katie Bell and Ron Weasley, whose lives are nearly lost as a result of Dumbledore not putting a tighter leash on Malfoy (since doing so would put him in danger of Voldemort's wrath.)

***** Not just that, but also extrapolating that since many Death Eaters managed to get off following the end of the first blood war, and Dumbledore was head of the judiciary, he must have had a hand in allowing them to go free.

**** I think that's also partly because he knows he won't survive the year anyway, so the price of Draco's success shouldn't be too high.

Remember he and Snape had no idea about the cabinet or plan, they thought Draco was working alone.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  A Harry Potter who grew up studying military tactics and strategy uses the attack on the Ministry as an opportunity to lay an ambush of his own - only to learn that his parents are still alive, as well as a twin brother whom Dumbledore calls the true boy-who-lived. And then, things get complicated. Military!Harry. A subversion of DZ2's Prodigal Son Challenge.
