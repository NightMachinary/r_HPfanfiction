don't have any particulars past that, except maybe not anything thats pure pwp as i'm not super partial to smut.


** Linkffn(stages of hope) has Luna as one of the main characters, and a few of the chapters are Luna-centric.

I think it's my favourite portrayal of her.

** I feel bad for self-promoting, but I wrote a one-shot about Luna meeting Rolf for the first time that I'm thinking of basing an adventure series on, and I'd love any thoughts on it :)

*** Hey I know it's been a few days since you posted this, but I figured you'd probably appreciate some feedback. Sorry if this isn't very critical, I'm in a bit of a hurry.

I am huge Harry/Luna fan, so I rarely read Luna/Rolf because it makes me sad, but I liked the summary a lot (Short, but captivating and to the point), and I figured it's less than 2k words so why not.

I really liked the story, especially the description of Luna. Canon directly describes Luna with dirty blonde hair, but I always write her with a lighter blonde, and you seem to have done the same, although it's great that left it a bit to the imagination, because what color is white sand really?

Perhaps the progression of their relationship was too rushed, but what more can you do in <2k words? And perhaps anything is believable with Luna. I'd have liked a bit more character development for Rolf though. You gave just enough to get a taste, but not enough imo.

Anyway, I liked it. The writing was great (from a quick read though). I wish I could give a more in depth review, but as I said I'm short on time. This actually was more in depth than I intended.

Anyway, toodles.

**** Thank you so much! This is so useful for me. I agree that it felt too short, hence why I'm thinking of turning it into a series. Thank you so much for all your detail, it really means a lot :)

** I'm partial to [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=179718][peppersweet's]] Luna, especially in [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=308510][Christmas in Prison]], which is about Luna's time in Malfoy Manor. The stories marked with a pairing aren't actually romantic, by the way.
