I'm looking for a certain tomione fic where I'm pretty sure that belatrix shot a spell at hermiones time turner and she went back in time and transformed into a kid and then went to tom riddles orphanage. Then when she was there to keep her wand hidden she transformed it into a teddy bear and she was trying to get into toms room to look for something to change her back. I remember this specific part where hermione was under a cupboard and tom was locked in the kitchen until he scrubbed his clothes clean. Anyone have any idea what fic that is? Any help is appreciated. Thanks:)

  The war is much larger, far longer, and much deeper than they could have imagined: fought on a scale that baffles the limits of human understanding. In such a world, perhaps it isn't surprising when Hermione Granger is sent back in time to rescue Tom Riddle's soul before he has the chance to destroy it. Rated M.

** Fated. (A very dark fic, Voldmort and Tom are the same, no snake face)

Voldemort's black gaze stares for what seems like hours. All is silence but my ragged breathing. My bloody lip dripping onto the forest floor. He finally speaks “It shall be a pleasure to bring you into submission Hermione”

I shiver and snap my caramel eyes to his black voids. The way he speaks my name, almost like it's forbidden, a whisper spoken in the darkened depths of depravity. I shouldn't like the way it falls from his lips, but- I snap out of it.

“I will never yield to you Voldemort,” I say with utter clarity. “If I'm going to die I refuse to do so on my knees begging to a monster like you!” I spew with as much Gryffindor courage I can summon. I feel my curls rise with magic. My skin prickles and the bridge of my nose begins to perspire. Voldemort chuckles, his voice is a deep melodic sound, as smooth as crushed velvet. Although, his eyes, his ink black eyes give off a predatory gleam.

“You'll find I can be very ...persuasive”
