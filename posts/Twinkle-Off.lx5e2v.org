:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
A read a fic a while back where Harry discovered the spell that Dumbledore uses to make his eyes twinkle.

At some point in the fic they have what amounts to a staring contest with both of them making their eyes twinkle even more.

I don't /think/ it was a Dumbledore-bashing fic.

Any Ideas?


** Twinkle staring contest should be one of the Triwizard tasks

** I think it was one of the more cracky time travel do-over stories.

I found a short one in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9783629][Harry Potter and the Trouble With Sorting Hats]] by Durandall, but I think there was a longer one where they each kept turning up the intensity of the twinkle.

I'll keep looking.

** Angry Harry and the Seven by Sinyk has something similar like that I believe. He and his cohort find a book of cantrips they have fun applying to make fun of Lockhart and Albus.
