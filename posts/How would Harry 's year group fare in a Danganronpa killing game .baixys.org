** Would need some major mentality changes or the first few days would be a kill fest between Gryffindor and Slytherin.

"Guys, it's Malfoy, it doesn't matter he really liked the victime, and has spent the day crying, or that 3 witness can swear he was in his room, and that there is some blood trace leading right to Corner room, Malfoy still probably did it".\\
"I tell you, it's Harry. He is a Dark Wizard, only one could have survived Voldemort as a baby. Even if he was stuck in his bed with a lot of broken bones because he defended Bones last night, or that Granger was his best friend. He probably used some kind of Dark magic like Parselmouth to kill her".
