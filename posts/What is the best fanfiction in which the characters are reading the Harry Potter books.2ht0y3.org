I'm generally looking for fanfics in which the real world and the Harry Potter universe get mixed up. The characters reading the books are one example only, though the one I'm looking for most. Got the idea from the recent thread about the trio being a quadruple, and especially [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8586147/1/A-Curse-of-Truth][A curse of truth]]. Otherwise, I don't really know any fics of that style.


** 99% of "characters reading the books" books are inane.

Here's perhaps the only interesting one of the bunch: world 298 of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2829366/4/Dimension-Hopping-for-Beginners][Dimension Hopping for Beginners]] by nonjon.

** Can someone explain to me the purpose behind the "characters read the books" trope?

I've never read one but it just seems like a poor method of introducing information without character interaction or world building. I should comment that I'm referring to stories where this is a major plot device, not stories where characters swap universes or move through time and the "books" are used as proof of something or mentioned in passing.

Eg Lily and James and Snape etc. read the Harry Potter series in the room of requirement.

** I just posted this in another thread, but I want to see Umbridge read the books in private, and try to use that information to discredit Fudge and take control of the Ministry of Magic. Probably then ruling Magical Britain with an iron fist. It's the only interesting 'characters read the books' thing I can think of.

*** That does sound interesting.

** The only reason to read one of these is because you want to re-read the series MST3K style. All of them are crap... Granted I've only read like 3 or 5 but all of them are crap.

If it is written in a way so as not to have the entire chapter or even long passages of chapters, and instead just has them read (offscreen) and react to the information then it might be okay, but I've never seen one like that.

It is incredibly lazy writing and hardly any imagination, but I guess it floats someones boat.

** Sorry but I don't actually have a recommendation because the only one I have read(and by default the best) is no longer on fanfiction.net and is unlikely to ever be reposted by it's author [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3036116/shopaholic1369][shopaholic1369]] as it was one of the casualties of the great purge a couple years ago and everytime he does repost the series it gets removed. Its a shame though because it got all the way to GOF.

Looking back on my memory though it had almost every damn cliche you could think of, seriously name some and I'll tell you if I can remember it.

On a final note if any one has a copy of this series I would be eternally grateful if you could send it to me, if not that's fine, probably best if it remains a fond memory of mine.
