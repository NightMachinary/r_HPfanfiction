(The entire name was unnecessary lol. I just like typing it.)

I don't remember Lily having many, if any, known flaws so I thought it'd be a good idea to ask all of you what you think would be good flaws for her.

I guess naivety may have been one of them but I think that has more to do with her being more sheltered compared to the Purebloods in the sense that they're exposed to more morbid things, especially the darker families.

I've seen fics where she's bossy or arrogant or something since they were probably basing her off of Hermione or something but that's it. Other than those, she doesn't have really any flaws I can think of so she's kind of boring and I'd prefer for her not to be whenever I write her in stories (which is a lot because I like making AUs and time travel fics).


** I mean you have to be Voldemort level of evil to talk shit about an orphan kid's dead mom to him so of course Lily may seem like a saint in Harry's view. As for what I've seen so far, she could be quite arrogant about her powers deliberately making Petunia look as uninteresting to her parents and whenever Petunia had an accomplishment that she wanted to brag about, she'd just shit on it. I mean we kind of see this behavior when she shits on the gift she received from her in her letter to Sirius as well as hints that she was coaxing James to make fun of Vernon during their first double date (if you take Pottermore entries as canon).

Other takes on her flaws I've seen were that she stayed friends with Snape out of convenience at least partially, claiming that the notes from his textbook were for her while they were partnering in Potions (and she would in exchange help Snape with Charms so that's that).

From Snape's memories, she can also be a bit of a bitch at times, that not to say that the targets of her bitchiness don't always deserve it but she could be more diplomatic about certain things.

** Another flaw could be her disregard for Petunia's feelings and not trying to include her enough, write to her, etc.

** Well, she kept hanging out with Snape even though she KNEW he "called everyone of my blood mudblood." So there's a flaw. She only broke off her friendship with him when he called HER that, but she was fine with knowing he was going around calling everyone else that word...

Not a great look, Lily.

*** It makes you think what other muggleborns thought about Lily, the ones who Snape and his upcoming Death friends Called mudbloods and attacked during the school years.

Lily wasn't described as perfect in the books even for what little we get of her even though people seem to think she was for some reason.

*** It's a terrible look, especially as JK clearly semi modeled the death eaters off neo nazi types and the KKK (leaving a burning mark, masks, etc.) It's one of those situations where you can tell JK is a white lady, cause as someone who isn't white (won't get specific cause reddit and anonymous) I have a hard time with other POC who are the "exception" to racist folks and are fine with being the "exception" (unless maybe it's someone grandparents, cause I understand that is hard to cut off immediate fam).

That'd actually be an interesting fic...maybe Harry is being semi critical of his dad and building Lily up and McGongall or someone goes "you know why Lily didn't have any friends left?..."

** Considering the character, I think you can give her any flaw you want as long as you hold back a bit (I doubt you call sell her as a younger Umbridge).

As people mentioned in the comment, it's not like anyone would mention any flaws Lily could have had in front of the orphaned son she died to protect. The only reason we knows James' (arrogance) was because Snape is an asshole who really hated him (plus the pensieve memory I guess).

Lily could have been a bit arrogant, or one of these "holier than thou" kind of girls, and why not just make her a "know it all". As long as you don't make her something like a blood purist (which would be pretty hard to sell), anything is fair game.

** I think peoples greatest strengths can be used to their greatest weakness.

For example Remus says that she always looked for the best in people, which I think is why it was so hard for Lily to let go of her friendship with Snape.

She knew he wasn't a bad kid at heart.... How could he be when he was always nice to her even when they were kids? But it worried her the folk he was starting to hang around with but she couldn't see just how far he had gone. When you're wearing rose tinted glasses all those red flags just look like ordinary flags.

By the same token I don't think Lily ever gave up on Petunia either. Her going off to Hogwarts created a rift between them but all she ever wanted was her big sister back. The one who protected her from being bullied in primary school, scared away the monsters under the bed and shared her ice cream from the ice cream van.

Not the one that called her a freak when she went to Hogwarts, who would blank her whenever she was home (if she couldn't avoid Lily entirely) and didn't even send an invite to her wedding.

Slughorn also said she was cheeky and had razor sharp wit that would make him laugh... But say the wrong thing to the wrong teacher and it can easily look like backchat and land you in detention. Even when it was meant as a joke. I mean I can totally see Harry getting his sass from Lily

Quotes from Harry

"The toilets never had something as disgusting as your head down it before - it might be sick" to Dudley

"Well done. You've finally learned the days of the week." When Dudley is gloating he knows what day it is and why none of Harry's friends have wished him happy birthday

And everyone's favourite "No need to call me Sir, Professor"

** I suppose willful ignorance like she ignored the flaws in her best friend's name until he turned on her in the middle of a crowd and called her a horrible name and a bunch of other stuff so I would say maybe a bit of just ignoring certain things

** Prideful, stubborn, naivety in her closest friends (which included Snape for a time until the signs were too obvious for her to ignore any longer), a dash of arrogance, dismissive of certain things, et cetera.

I've actually seen few fics where Lily does something dumb and James calls her out on it -- it's /always/ Lily as being perfect.

She was a human being. We all have our flaws.

For example, she's proud of her rich, auburn hair: Something happens to it in a potions accident, caused by a friend (e.g. Marlene or Mary). She gets pissy with them.

James or someone else (even Snape) calls her out on it.

** Note: this scene is /before/ Snape calls her a slur

#+begin_quote
  Snape was hanging upside down in the air, his robes falling over his head to reveal skinny, pallid legs and a pair of graying underpants. Many people in the small crowd watching cheered. Sirius, James, and Wormtail roared with laughter. *Lily, whose furious expression had twitched for an instant as though she was going to smile*, said, “Let him down!”
#+end_quote

This part pissed me off. If Draco hung Harry upside down and revealed his underpants, no way in hell would she be anything but livid. This scene comes off very death eater-y to me.

#+begin_quote
  “Granger, they're after Muggles, ” said Malfoy. “D'you want to be showing off your knickers in midair? Because if you do, hang around . . . they're moving this way, and it would give us all a laugh.”
#+end_quote

In regards to ‘oh but Snape's a supremacist twat, he's her frienddddd.

I'm not sure what flaw you would name this as. She's just not a ‘pure' character.

*** I feel nearly similing at something, while a bit cruel, everyone else found hilarious, is worlds away from 'death eater-y'. I feel it is more the opposite, she found it funny, but deliberately tried not to show it as that would encourage the Marauders and hurt Snape's feelings.

As a side point, I feel that comparing someone to the death eaters is thrown about far to casually in this fandom. Just because someone does something less than perfect does not mean that they are comparable to the magical Gestapo, concentration camps and mass executions included. Hell, the entire premise of Malfoy's 'redemption arc' is that while he may be a self-entitled narcissistic douchebag, he is still not inheriently a terrible enough person to be a willing death eater (incidently unlike Snape).

A point JKR has Sirius stress to 14-15 year old Harry. I've come to the conclusion that the issue with the majority of (HP) fan fiction is that the majority of authors see things as black or white. Everything from house traits to Death Eaters.

*** while there is some validity to what you said, I will mention that we saw all of that through Harry's POV, Harry who never had a great relationship with Snape in the first place.

Him thinking Lily was close to smiling at Snape's suffering might just be a personal interpretation than an objective fact.

***** I actually think it's shitty that she's fine with him calling other people mudbloods but only cuts him off when he calls her one. I'm a POC and I'd think any other POC who hangs out with a white racist dude who openly spews racist slurs was a total asshole, tbh.

I think fanon has turned it into "Lily leaves Snape over a slur" but it's really a build up if you re-read the Snape's flash back scenes in the books....he's practing dark arts, he's calling other people slurs, etc.
