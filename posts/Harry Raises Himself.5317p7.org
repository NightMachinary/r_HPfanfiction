I am looking for stories where harry plays a major part in his own upbringing, au or time travel doesn't matter. I've read and enjoyed linkffn(a brand new start by fairywm) and linkffn(not even a first chance! by senawario)


** This somewhat old thread has a few: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3c96np/lf_harry_travels_back_in_time_to_teach/][LF Harry travels back in time to teach/raise himself]], linksub(3c96np). A few more that weren't on that list but also fit: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7150729/1/][Full Circle]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4421582/1/Me_and_Myself][Me and Myself]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3548816/1/Second_Life][Second Life]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1555781/1/][Death, Destroyer of Worlds]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1205031/1/][It's Never Too Late for a Happy Childhood]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3362002/1/][Taking Care of Myself]] to that list. Both [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2256&chapno=1][Flashback]] and [[http://lunadeath02.livejournal.com/506583.html][Love Thyself]] aren't bot linkable but also fit.

  (alt title: Disproportionate response). Give the death-eaters a second chance? No way, not even a *first* chance! This is a "redo" fic with a twist. The pairing will eventually be Harmony but a good part of the story happens when they are too young so hard-core Harmonians need to be patient. Rated M for possible violence in later chapters.
