  James wants to spend the winter break with Lily, but she still hates him. He makes a plan to change bodies with Snape during the break, knowing that the two live close and spend time at each other's houses, so he can be with Lily and find out if anything is happening between the two. During that time, Severus spends some time at the Potter's against his wish, worrying about what might happen with James and Lily during the break.orJames and Severus change bodies and end up finding out that life is not always what it seems.

** If you can track it down, there's always the /Draco Trilogy/. (Harry-Draco).

Later became the /Mortal Instruments/ series, hence its attempted excision from the Internet.

There /might/ be functioning links from TVTropes.
