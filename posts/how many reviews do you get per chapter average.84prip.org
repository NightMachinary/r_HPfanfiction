Just curious


** For my fics it goes, averaged out, as:

- Letters: About 100
- Princess: Around 75
- QWC: Around 50
- Vitam Paramus: Around 41
- Limpieze De Sangre: Around 55.

Moral: Write a plotless meandering bullshit worthless story with an older french girl in it to get more reviews.

****** No. He isn't. Letters is awful. It's nowhere near as good, technically speaking as Vitam Paramus or Limpieza De Sangre. It's pandering bullshit with no real plot, conflict, or any real redeeming qualities.

Letters is nothing more than a gigantic flashing sign of my own failure as a writer. It's hallow, heartless, predictable and far too safe. It just shows that I didn't really even have a good idea yet. The F1 motif is horrendously poorly executed and the writing on the first five chapters is down right bad and, frankly, doesn't get much better.

Using [[/r/Baseball]] as a reference, that's like saying George Springer isn't as good as Mike Trout.

He's still really good, it's just Mike Trout is on a totally different level than anyone else.

***** That might just be due to the pairing. Decently written Harry/Fleur is really hard to find and Letters is easily in the Top 10, whether it meets your personal standards or not. Probably Top 5 if we only count completed stories

** Between 4 & 6 at a guess. That's at 2-3 years after completion because I don't get them any more; so that's probably the final total. There may well be individual chapters with no reviews at all but I can't make it matter enough to check.

** For The Life He Leads, it averages to about 30 a chapter, though the first 12 chapters got about 13 reviews, whereas the last four chapters all have 50-plus. As it got more popular, I obviously got more reviews.

I will also concur with [[/u/TE7]] - more Fleur, more reviews.

** Ongoing five I get like make 1 if I'm lucky my ongoing fic Magpie barely got its first review after a month and 4 chapters. It also depends on the subject, I write a lot of OC stuff with lesser characters. Stuff that's been up longer gets a few more. I've actually had most success with my Once Upon a Time stuff in FF

** Let's seeeeeee... looking at both FFN and AO3, discarding the comment strings on AO3 that's mostly me having a chat with the reviewers, adding up the total number of reviews, and diviting it between the chapters of the story...

... the average number of reviews per chapter of my story, "Holly Potter and the Witching World" is...

...five.

Well, that's all right then.
