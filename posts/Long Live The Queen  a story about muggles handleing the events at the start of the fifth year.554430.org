  "I'm just sick and tired of people trying to control me! It's bad enough that Dumbledore treats me like a child when I'm at school, but he even does it on summer break. And the Ministry seems to only care about doing as little as possible about anything that has to do with Wizards, and only worries about hiding us from the Muggle world. The only people who saw my Patronus were my cousin who knows about magic, and Mrs. Figg, who's apparently a Squib that Dumbledore's been having spy on me my whole life! Aargh!"

  "Sure, pup, let me just finish feeding Buckbeak and we'll go downstairs and talk," replied Sirius

**** The only thing it is is "novel"-length and a rather long one at that. The basic plot of this story is not groundbreaking as I have seen several very similar attempts; but at least it is completed, so there is that.

I don't think the whole magically-enforced treaty idea can make sense without twisting canon too far, mostly because it calls into question the entire back-story of the wizarding world and how it came to be separated from the muggle society.

You have to understand the age this happened in. Our real-world history shows that the peak of witchcraft persecution had been going on for at least a century by the time the wizards signed the Statute of Secrecy. We're basically talking of a full three or four generations of witches and wizards that grew up being attacked by non-magicals for their inherited talents. They ended up forming their own hidden communities for mutual support and protection. The unofficial wiki even says that ...

#+begin_quote
  In the Great Britain, the newly-created Ministry of Magic attempted to liaise with the Muggle British Monarch (then jointly William III and Mary II) via a special Ministry Delegation, begging them for the protection of wizards under Muggle law.[4] The failure of this attempt at official recognition and protection seems to have been the final straw that forced wizardkind to voluntarily move in the opposite direction toward secrecy.

... which is apparently extra information taken from Rowling's official website, so I like to acknowledge this as canon backstory.

With that in mind, do you think the wizarding leaders would allow themselves to be beholden to a magically binding contract for their whole society? Would an autonomous rule under certain guidelines, as the wizarding world in these kinds of stories usually receives, even be possible when the British monarchy wasn't even willing to protect their country's wizards by non-magical law? No, I'm pretty sure that the wizarding world had enough of it by that point and saw the complete separation from the non-magical world as their only chance.

This does make the wizarding world in effect a rogue government, as the non-magical crown holds dominion over all of the British Isles. But how do you plan to enforce that, when a) you've been made to forget about it by wizards in the first place, b) there is no convenient magically binding contract in existence and c) there is no way at all for non-magicals to put pressure on the wizarding world? They're entirely separate societies by the late 20th century after all, no economic sanctions would work, nor would those wizards in charge believe the threat of muggle war and violence. Unless the non-magical Great Britain wanted to start a war over the wizards' hidden ruling government within their territory, there's no way to actually enforce their will on them.

Anyway, sorry for my rant, it was longer than I thought it'd be. I just wanted to make a point why I didn't read this story beyond the first few chapters and why there are so many others out there just as bad. The writing was okay from what I have seen and the author should be commended for his regular updates and for actually finishing the story, but that alone doesn't make for a good tale I'm afraid.

** Usually when the Queen is involved, you can bet it's a muggle wank fic. The Queen often had some Deux ex Machina super treaty that rendered the Ministry ineffective, so Harry and his muggle soldiers could move in and finish their enemies off. Dumbledore and Weasley bashing are also mandatory in those fics.
