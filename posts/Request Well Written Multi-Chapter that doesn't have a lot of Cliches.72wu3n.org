So I love fanfiction but it seems like authors re use the same typical plotlines, I'm looking for fanfictions that are different from the usual.

Well written, any rating is fine. Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash. Would rather it be completed, but if not a bunch of chapters is okay.

Now there can be cliches in the story, just as long as the author does something unique with it.

Any Era is fine and anyone can be the main character.

I don't like Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione, but any other pairing is okay. Unless Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione is written well/believable enough.

NO Weasley and Dumbledore bashing. Unless it's like Percy. I'd be okay with Dumbledore bashing I suppose, just as long as it's not a lot of it. Or as long as the story is interesting enough. But I'd rather not have Weasley bashing unless it's like Percy like I said.

Also no Crossovers please.

Am fine with canon or AU stories.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

** If you're okay with really AU fics (author does loads of Muggle AU, or a kind of video game fantasy world AU and fairy tale AU) and Tomarry slash, I'd recommend RenderedReversed. He/She is like a breath of fresh air to me.
