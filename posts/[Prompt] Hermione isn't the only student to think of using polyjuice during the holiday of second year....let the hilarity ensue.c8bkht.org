I feel its not much of a stretch to think that there are Gryffindors in each year that thinks a Slytherin in their year is the Heir of Slytherin. Over winter break multiple Gryffindors take polyjuice and end up in the Slytherin common room all at the same time interrogating each other as they pretend to be Slytherins.


** Meanwhile, the Hufflepuffs find dozens of Slytherins unconscious in broom closets, and the castle is locked down for quarantine of a mysterious illness. McGonagall goes nuts when she can't find half the Gryffindors.
