As in the title, I want fics where Ginny is confronted with the intensity between Harry and Hermione and has to navigate what that means for her relationship. It would be nice if the story touches on how it is Hermione who was with Harry at his worst and how Ginny feels about that.

Harry/Ginny endgame and no Harry/Hermione or Ron/Hermione romance please. Please no bashing of Ginny or Hermione.
