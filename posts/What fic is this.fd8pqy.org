I'm looking for a fic where dark lord Harry goes back in time to be with Hermione. The whole time he is struggling not to manipulate her into loving him. He also uses his knowledge of her parents to gain their support, I distinctly remember an interaction with a cousin who used to bully Hermione. Thanks for any help ðŸ˜Š
