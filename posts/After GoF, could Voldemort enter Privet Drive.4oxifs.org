I realise that there is probably an explanation as to why he can't despite having "blood of the enemy", but I can't seem to find it anywhere and I don't have my books with me at the moment to check the source.

Can anyone point me to a good reference if not and if he can potentially enter Privet Drive, why doesn't he?


** Part of the protection provided to Harry is Petunia's acceptance of him.

#+begin_quote
  /"She may have taken you grudgingly, furiously, unwillingly, bitterly, yet still she took you, and in doing so, she sealed the charm I placed upon you. Your mother's sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could give you."/
#+end_quote

Pair that with this quote from DH:

#+begin_quote
  /Dumbledore had at least taught Harry something about certain kinds of magic, of the incalculabe power of certain acts./
#+end_quote

Also take into account that Voldemort knew nothing about the power of love. He met his first defeat attacking Harry Potter in his home, I don't think he would risk it again as Tom is at heart a coward.

*** Well thought, particularly on the last point.

I guess there is also a certain arrogance Voldemort has toward love considering how his love potion conception potentially shaped his mentality about it.

** He couldn't. The only possible explanation is that the blood protection and the protection on Privet Drive are separate issues - Dumbledore used the blood as a basis, perhaps as "fuel", but the spell he put on the house acts in its own right.

** I could swear Harry asked this question and was told almost directly that it worked because Voldemort thought it worked. That may be fanon, but I swear it is a direct quote.

*** See that's my problem. Canon and fanon are mixing up in my head, so genuine canon information that isn't as obvious to me has departed over the years.
