Here's a hopefully helpful list of fanfiction archives, forums, and related sites.

Feel free to comment or message me to add anything that you would like to add.

*General Databases*

- *[[http://www.fanfiction.net/][Fanfiction.Net]]* (FFN) - The biggest database of HP fanfiction. Registered users can subscribe to stories, authors or communities to be alerted to updates. Since it's so large, mods and the search bar can be quite ineffective. [[http://fffn.darklordpotter.net/search/1][FilteredFanfiction]] (beta) can be used for a more controllable and less frustrating search, while [[http://fictionhunt.com/][FictionHunt]] can search and show character mentions. (thanks [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/qyump/fanfiction_archives_forums_and_sites/c432nac][chralieB]]!)

- *[[http://www.ficwad.com/][FicWad]]* (FW) - Another big database, although not quite as large as FFN. Cleaner layout. Employs a unique rating point economy system. Stories can be age-restricted. Site admin seems to be on extended hiatus or something.

- *[[http://archiveofourown.org/][Archive of Our Own]]* (AO3) - Invite only, download-enabled in multiple formats. Nicely refined search function (by tag, fandom, etc).

- *[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/][HP Fanfiction]]* - Seems to be quite large, probably the second largest after FFN. Its layout looks quite... primitive. Search function seems dense and frustrating.

- *[[http://fanfiction.mugglenet.com/][Mugglenet]]* - Haven't used this personally.

- *[[http://www.mediaminer.org/][Media Miner]]* - Seems to be a general fanfic database for all universes, particularly anime and manga.

- *[[http://fictionalley.blogspot.com/][FictionAlley]]* - Includes Schnoogle, AstronomyTower, Riddikulus and TheDarkArts. Doesn't seem to be very active. It does however have archives of extremely old fanfics. Layout and search function are frustrating.

*Smaller General Databases*

- *[[http://patronuscharm.net/][PatronusCharm]]* (PC) - Much much smaller database, although very streamlined and easy to use. Easy respond review format far exceeds that on other databases. Operated by and mostly catering to DLP authors.

- *[[http://www.fanficauthors.net/][Fanfic Authors]]* - Extremely small, but stories by are by established authors through invite only.

- *[[http://www.sycophanthex.com/][Sycophant Hex]]* - Similar to above. Extremely small, all stories pre-screened by board of mods before publication.

- *[[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/index.php][Petulant Poetess]]* - Mod pre-screening. Currently active. Sponsors occasional fic challenges. (thanks [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/qyump/fanfiction_archives_forums_and_sites/c41jucw][eviltwinskippy]]!)

- *[[http://thequidditchpitch.org/][The Quidditch Pitch]]* (TQP) - General fics, lots of Ron/Hermione. (thanks [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/qyump/fanfiction_archives_forums_and_sites/c41vn51][crayonbox]]!)

- *[[http://www.witchfics.org/][Witchfics]]* - collaborative HP fanfic site

*Adult General Databases* (NC-17) (thanks to [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/qyump/fanfiction_archives_forums_and_sites/c420k4l][eviltwinskippy]]!)

- *[[http://www.restrictedsection.org/][Restricted Section]]* - General HP adult fanfic (NC-17)

- *[[http://hp.adultfanfiction.net/][Adult Fanfiction]]* - General HP adult fanfic (NC-17)

*Specialized Databases* (sorted by pairing)

- *[[http://sugarquill.net/][The Sugar Quill]]* - Almost anything goes, but seems to have /heavy/ emphasis on the Harry/Ginny.

- *[[http://www.siye.co.uk/][Sink Into Your Eyes]]* - emphasis on Harry/Ginny

- *[[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/fanfiction][Portkey]]* - Harry/Hermione, Draco/Ginny, Ron/Luna, James/Lily

- *[[http://www.simplyundeniable.com/][Simply Undeniable]]* - Harry/Ginny, Ron/Hermione

- *[[http://www.checkmated.com/][checkmated]]* - emphasis on Ron/Hermione

- *[[http://grangerenchanted.com/][Granger Enchanted]]* - Hermione-centered. Stories are mod-prescreened, albeit poorly.

- *[[http://www.dramione.org/][Hawthorn and Vine]]* - Draco/Hermione. Mod pre-screen.

- *[[http://quietones.org/][It's Always the Quiet Ones]]* - Dedicated to Hermione, Blaise and Draco "in every way" (NC-17)

- *[[http://www.dracoandginny.com/][The Fire and Ice Archive]]* - Draco/Ginny

- *[[http://archive.skyehawke.com/main.php?list=2][Skyhawke]]*- Slash, especially Harry/Draco

- *[[http://www.thehexfiles.net/][The Hex Files]]* - Harry/Draco

- *[[http://www.potionsandsnitches.net/fanfiction/][Potions and Snitches]]* - Extremely large Harry/Snape community, also runs the [[http://www.fanfiction.net/community/Potions_and_Snitches/182/][third biggest FF.net community]]

- *[[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/index.php][Walking the Plank]]* - Harry/Snape

- *[[http://simmeringcauldrons.com/efiction/][Simmering Cauldrons]]* - Snape/Hermione. Invitation-only authors. (NC-17)

- *[[http://www.themasque.net/wiktt/efiction/index.php][When I Kissed The Teacher]]* (WIKTT) - teacher/student shipping-centered. Art page and subsection dedicated to Snape/Hermione. (NC-17)

- *[[http://www.ssf-moonshadow.com/][Moonshadow]]* - Snape/Lupin (NC-17)

- *[[http://admmfics.proboards.com/index.cgi?][Albus and Minerva]]* - Dumbledore/McGonagall. Inactive, but large archive of old stories

*Forums and Wikis*

- *[[http://www.mugglenet.com/][MuggleNet]]* - Probably the largest and most well-known HP discussion site. [[http://fanfiction.mugglenet.com/][Subsection]] hosts fanfiction.

- *[[http://www.potterforums.com/][Potter Forums]]* - Seems relatively active, although I haven't used it personally.

- *[[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/][Dark Lord Potter]]* (DLP) - Fanfiction review and discussion. HP-centered, although includes other fandoms too. Registered users may access Work by Author section (WbA) for early beta updates. They keep impressively high standards and generally produce very well-written fanfiction. Monthly writing contests. Tendency towards darker fanfiction. Notable dislike for slash and post-OoTP canon. Runs [[http://patronuscharm.net/][PC]], [[http://fffn.darklordpotter.net/search][FilteredFanfiction]] and a notable [[http://www.fanfiction.net/community/DLP_5_Starred_and_Featured_Authors/84507/][C2 on FFN]], currently the largest FFN community.

- *[[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page][HP Wikia]]* - Can't remember that tiny detail in OoTP chapter 5? A huge wiki of everything canon.

- *[[http://wiki.unknowableroom.org/Harry_Potter_Wiki_Encyclopaedia][UnknowableWiki]]* - Quite large, but largely defunct and inactive.


** Excellent idea... maybe we could pin this thread to the sidebar somehow, for quick access when seeking a new database? I've got it saved, either way. :)

** Nice idea!

I've got two to add, both for specialized category.

[[http://admmfics.proboards.com/index.cgi?][Albus & Minerva Fanfic Board]]: Inactive as of late, but has stories going back to 2004.

[[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/fanfiction][Portkey]]: For the Harry/Hermione, Ginny/Draco, Ron/Luna, and Lily/James types of people. Still surprisingly active.

** What a great idea. Thanks for this list - I hadn't heard of half of them. May I recommend a few more?

[[http://www.dramione.org/][Hawthorn and Vine]] - a specialized HP site for only Draco/Hermione fics. Stories are prescreened by mods.

[[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/index.php][Petulant Poetess]] - a general Potterverse site. Stories are prescreened by mods. A fairly active site that sponsors occasional fic challenges and fests that bolster the roster.

[[http://grangerenchanted.com/][Granger Enchanted]] - Stories must include Hermione Granger as the main character - otherwise, anything goes. Stories are prescreened by mods, but frankly, they do spotty work - there are still lots of spelling and grammar errors in the stories.

** A few friends have informed me of more sites for this list. Some of these carry nothing but adult fic, and are not intended for readers under 18.

[[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/index.php][Walking the Plank]] - Dedicated to HP/SS ship fics

[[http://quietones.org/][It's Always the Quiet Ones]] - Dedicated to Hermione, Blaise and Draco "in every way"

[[http://www.restrictedsection.org/][Restricted Section]] - General HP adult fanfic (under 18s prohibited)

[[http://hp.adultfanfiction.net/][Adult Fanfiction]] - General HP adult fanfic (under 18s prohibited) - I'm told the search function is utterly borked.

[[http://www.ssf-moonshadow.com/][Moonshadow]] - Dedicated to Snape/Lupin slashfic (under 18s prohibited)

[[http://www.witchfics.org/][Witchfics]] - a collaborative HP fanfic site. Looks like it's been active for a number of years

[[http://www.themasque.net/wiktt/efiction/index.php][WIKTT - When I Kissed The Teacher]] - adult HP fanfiction, particularly focused on teacher/student ships. There's an art page & a subsection dedicated to HGSS. Obviously, under 18s prohibited.

[[http://simmeringcauldrons.com/efiction/][Simmering Cauldrons]] - "The archive of Hermione Granger and Severus Snape Fan Fiction by Snapesflower and other invited authors." Adult fanfiction, under 18s prohibited.

** [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/main.php?list=2][Skyhawke]] has tons of fic, lots of slash and Drarry.

[[http://www.thehexfiles.net/][The Hex Files]] is a huge Drarry fanfic database.

** Maybe should share: [[http://fictionhunt.com][FictionHunt]].

Not as sophisticated as [[http://fffn.darklordpotter.net]], still maybe helpful to some.

Most interesting thing you may find are those red/blue bars that represent character mentions in whole fanfic text. Useful thing in a way that it actually allows you to see how well author used character names and pronouns.

Amount of fics is quite low mainly because of the feature called footprint that slows processing down.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/]] is a general fic database with many very good HP fics. Of special note is the fact that you can directly download the stories from the site in the following formats by just clicking a single button: MOBI, EPUB, PDF, HTML, X.
