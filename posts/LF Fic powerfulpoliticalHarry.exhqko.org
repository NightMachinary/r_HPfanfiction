** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8186071/1/Harry-Crow][Harry Crow]] is a Robst fic, where he's raised by the goblins and he's low key op, but it's definitely long and he's very powerful politically and physically. There is a bit of bashing, so if you're familiar with his fics and ok with it it's probably what you're looking for. (If everything but the synopsis sounds okay, check out his other fics [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/1451358/][here]] and they have the whole powerful harry with different circumstances and all are harmony)
