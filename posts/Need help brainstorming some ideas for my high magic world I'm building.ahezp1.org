I just read the absolutely incredibly story [[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6995114/1/The-Wizard-of-the-Kaleidoscope](The]] Wizard of the Kaleidoscope) by OnTheImportanceOfLungs. And it gave me a lot of great ideas for a similar fic.

Since I'm also a big fan of D&D I'll be borrowing some elements from that setting instead of Naruto as OnTheImportanceOfLungs did.

In my world spells will be categorized in a similar fashion as D&D spells are, so starting with Cantrips, then First Level, Second Level e.t.c. all the way to Ninth Level. It is theoretically possible to go beyond Ninth Level but it hasn't been seen since the time of Merlin, who sacrificed his own life to become the God of Magic in order to help prevent Magic from disappearing forever.

In my world Magic is an infinite weave that covers the the universe like a soft fabric, it is practically indestructible but is known to wear off with heavy use in a specific area. Wizards cast magic by softly "scraping" off a bit from the surface of The Weave, which is what learned Wizards call magic. Cantrips and First Level spells take a tiny, infinitesimal amount of The Weave, so little it's hardly ever noticed. Whereas Ninth Level spells roughly carve out deep wounds, eventually the wounds will heal of course but if more and more Ninth Level spells are cast then eventually the weave will split and forever change the nature of magic in that particular area. These places are known to cause Wild Magic, spontaneous and chaotic snaps of magic that can cause all sorts of effects, from turning someone's hair neon blue to tranfiguring a nearby tree into a Nundu that will proceed to decimate the nearby region for miles around with it's toxic breath.

One such place of WIld Magic exists at Mona Insula, the Roman and thus Wizard name for Anglesey, an island situated on the north coast of Wales and was once the location of a mass sacrifice of Druids which created a Tenth Level curse aimed at the invading Roman force lead by Paulinus. The curse was so powerful that it teared The Weave around Mona Insula causing Wild Magic to form.

Wizards and Witches cast spells the old fashioned way, by learning from spell books, and memorizing wand movements and incantations. Once they've cast the spell correctly several times they will be able to cast it instinctively and more use will lead to short cuts such as silent casting and point casting, which is simply pointing your wand and casting the spell without the required wand movements. By this point you would have considered the spell mastered. It is naturally, harder to master higher and higher level spells, and only the rare geniuses such as Voldemort and Dumbledore have mastered Ninth Level magics.

Not all Wizards and Witches can do this of course, some lack the willpower, some have a weaker capacity for magic due to all sorts of reasons, be they curses, genetics or conditions such as Lycanthropy and Vampirism.

All magic falls under a category, I'm working on the exact number of spells but I'm leaning towards Seven as it's the most powerful number in magic. A wizard or witch can further specialise in a school.

First of all, Wands: Wands are necessary for all Witches and Wizards to cast spells above Cantrips wandlessly, although some skilled wizards and witches can cast First Level spells wandlessly as well. A wand requires a wood from a magic tree to act as a durable base for the magic to travel through, a core from a magical creature to provide the magic to power the wand, as well as runes carved into the wood to provide stability and a conduit for the wizard or witch to pour their magic into. The wand "chooses" the wizard or witch because only that wizard or witches magic "fits" the conduit so that only they can use that wand to its fullest potential. Close relatives have similar conduits but it's not a perfect fit.

*Cantrips*. Cantrips are not a school of magic but a universal pool of minor spells that any wizard or witch can learn. These range from blowing out a candle with merely a thought and a gesture. To animating mundane household items, most wizards and witches need a wand to provide the animated objects direction though some can handle that wandlessly. Some cantrips can be deadly, such as a malevolent wizard or witch can, with but a twitch of his or her fingers cause a spark of flame to appear at a location of their choosing within their line of sight. This can cause someone's clothing to be lit on fire and lead to death.

Now, onto the schools:

1. Evocation: Mainly focuses on elemental magics and force generating spells such as Reducto. Stating with the First Level Incendio and ending in the Ninth Level Fiendfyre. A wizard or witch who specialises in this school is known as an Evoker. Tends to get taught primarily in Defense Against the Dark Arts, if the teacher is competent of course.

2. Conjuration: Falls under the lose umbrella term "Transfiguration" which has become the popular vernacular to bundle this school along with Transmutation. Conjuration of course focuses on bringing objects and creatures from nothingness into the material plane. a wizard or witch who specialises in Conjuration is known as a Conjurer.

3. Transmutation. The second school under the umbrella term "Transfiguration". This school focuses on altering the state of on object or creature. A wizard or witch who specialises in this school is known as a Transmuter.

4. Illusion. Illusion magics focus on tricking the senses into perceiving false information. This can range from invisibility, silent movement, smell masking and so on, some Illusion spells are taught in Charms. Mind magics also fall into this category such as the Fifth Level spell Obliviate, Ninth Level spells such as the Cruciatus and Imperius are also Illusion spells. A wizard or Witch who specialises in Illusion is known as an Illusionist.

5. Abjuration. Falls under the umbrella category "Charms" along with the Divination school. Abjuration magic produces spells that protect, block, or banish. The Fourth Level shield spell Protego that protects the user First to Third Level spell as well as the Third Level disarming spell Expelliarmus falls under this category. A wizard who specialises in Abjuration spells is known as an Abjurer.

6. Divination. This magic reveals information. It can range from a simple First Level Point-me spell all the way high level scrying and spying spells. It can also counter these spells with various barriers such as the Third Level Repellum Muggleton all the way to the Ninth Level Fidelius. A wizard or witch who specialises in this school is known as a Diviner.

7. Necromancy. These spells debilitate and affect the physical being of a creature as well as magics that focus on the use of blood and the soul. These range from harmless hexes such as the First Level Bat Bogey all the way to the Ninth Level Avada Kedavra which forcefully separates the soul from the body, killing the creature instantly. A wizard or witch who specialises in this school is known as a Necromancer, though this term is old fashioned and rarely used.

Runes, Arithmancy and Potions are not school of magic but instead are schools of creation. Runes are used in the making of wards and permanent objects. So in order to protect a home you would use runes to create a ward stone and in order to make a magic object you would carve runes into the object.

Arithmancy is used in spell creation as well as writing spell scrolls which are a useful aid in teaching wizards and witches how to cast higher level spells or to sell in a shop so that the average housewitch can cast a thunderbolt if need be.

Potions are used in the creation of potions naturally, bottled bottles with all sort of effects ranging from cures, to poisons as well as effects that increase the muscle density of the user, to temporarily increasing mental alacrity.

Wand Crafting also falls under the creation category though it is not taught in Hogwarts.

*Sorcerers.*

Once in a thousand years, a Sorcerer will be born. These extremely rare individuals have the ability to cast magic without the use of a wand freely and without any strain. For they are infused with magic and generate themselves through their body.

Why this is is a mystery, some forgotten high level rituals are said to be able to force a greater demon into the body of a infant inside their mother. Some say that a ancient and powerful dragon fed the heart of his dying wife to a human in gratitude for a great boon. That human then became known as a Dragon Aspect, capable of producing dragon fire by breathing!

These Sorcerers can not only master any spell they can do so with ease since they are one with magic and all magic is instinctual to them. Merlin was, of course a Sorcerer before he became a God.

These are all my ideas thus far, what do you think? I would love some feedback, and if anyone else is familiar with D&D lore and would like to chime in with some ideas that would be very much appreciated as well!

Thanks!


** The one thing I'd say you should be careful about is the whole â€œnobody has done this in a thousand years/ever before but a young school kid manages it on accident for no reason. Id day maybe look at the ideas the Victoria Potter uses as inspiration as well, transfiguration and charms at least are explained a bit and use that to come up with something.

*** Don't worry, Hermione won't be suddenly casting Ninth Level spells in her first year, no matter how smart she is. To cast such high level magics you not only need to know the spell, you also need to be able to concentrate, not only cast the spell but also to provide the spell with power such as thinking of a strong emotion or imaging your desired effect with perfect clarity. No eleven year old can do this, not even a Sorcerer.

**** Ok the reason I said it is because I read some rune master Harry fic where he's the only one ever able to free draw runes and how special he is then teacher tries to do it and fails miserably. Also make sure to follow the rule of if you make Harry a Jedi give Voldemort a Death Star.

***** Runes are tricky to learn in my story because you need to actually be able to read them, just like learning music, it takes time and several years of study before you can even begin in creating your own runic script or matrix.

****** Oh if you want to go deeper with wand chooses the wizard I'd say maybe make it so that everyone's magic is different line some is more volatile some need more effort to draw out and make each core length and wood combination cause magic to react differently as it would explain olivander being able to figure out which wand would fit more likely. And add something like your magic is your soul or something like that explaining why you can tell a lot about a wizard from their wand. Maybe also make it so that when you cast spells you put a bit of yourself into that spell so it makes sense that it's easier for you or a close friend to take your own magic down than an enemy. Or like if you transfigure an animal it acts like you want it to because your magic has your personality/desires in it. Maybe make it so that the higher level spells require more complex wand movements/incantations and as you get better you can shave some of it off.

******* Fantastic ideas and all in line with my story. Thanks!

Sorcerers cast spells with hand gestures, whilst learning the spell they will use intricate hand gestures as well as verbal incantations, but as they cast the spell more often they start to use less and less gestures and when mastered they can simply point a finger and cast the spell silently.

******** Maybe make it similar to a few other fics I've read where belief matters heavily like the more people who believe that if you do this, that happens the easier it is for it to be done. Basically making it so like for lumos, it's so easy because so many people do it the magic in the worlds weaving is used to it so it's easier to pull from. This could also explain why so few people are able to pull off high level spells and make it a circle of people have trouble doing this because it's hard so it's not done enough for the magic of the universe to make it easier to cast.

******** I'd add maybe make it so that people are more talented at one area than others but make it so that certain schools of magic are like anathema to each other kind of similar to avatar the last air bender where earth and air are completely different and opposite or something so people who are good at doing one thing are naturally bad at doing something else.

********* Yes, I was thinking about that, Necromancy for example is an anathema to Abjuration because Abjurers protect wherass Necromancers decay and corrupt. Voldemort is not even capable of casting a simple Protego but he makes up for it by clever uses of Evocation and Conjuration by summoning stones in the path of spells to block them.

********** Maybe as part of the story Harry can be good at magic that many dark Wizards/lords are typically good at so people have more reasons to look at him as an up and coming dark lord. Like with parseltounge maybe even make it so that there are some necromancy spells that aren't so bad and are actually good or something like that and the school as a whole is hated because of a few practitioners so it's a taboo. Basically you don't hear the good stories only the really bad.

********** Maybe make it so that there are a bunch of people that make higher level spells frowned upon because they're super scared of possible consequences. Perhaps make it so that one of or multiple characters are secretly learning magic they're not supposed to like it's illegal or super heavily frowned upon/discouraged to cast x spell but they do anyway and have part of the story being about the learning/using the spells with the user of those spells letting only certain people know and hoping they don't make a mistake and someone snitches.

** This sounds fantastic and very well thought out. I've only played D&D once, but I can definitely see how it's influenced the magic. I'm personally interested in Merlin as a god and how that affects the religion of the wizarding world. I never got the impression of much religious life in canon, but that would be an interesting way to conceptualize magic. I'm also interested in how the sorcerer would play in the story. The most intuitive answer would be to have Harry be the sorcerer, but I think it'd also be interesting to have it not be one of the main three young characters or at least a character that isn't given OP status commonly. When this fic is written, I'd be interested in reading it

*** Thanks! In my fic the world of Harry will be part of the same D&D multiverse, so Wizards in Harry's world can summon and make pacts with Demons or Devils as well as elemental genies. There is only one species of Dragon native to Harry's world and that's the Ruby Dragon, a mix between a Brass and a Red Dragon, it's nature is Chaotic Good and a fully grown Ruby Dragon is said to be as big as a fully grown Red. Eventually its magical bloodlines was diluted by centuries of inbreeding to the point that weak mongrel subspecies such as the Norwegian Ridgeback were born. A true Ruby Dragon hasn't been seen since the glory days of Babylon.

A powerful and knowledgeable Wizard can learn the Planeshift spell and travel the multiverse, though there hasn't been an Earth magical seen outside their native lands since the days of Merlin so most sentient beings have forgotten all about Earth.

Deep within the Atlantic Ocean, below the crushing depths where there is no sunlight lies an ancient and forgotten city. Within lies a sleeping Aboleth, let's hope he never wakes up.
