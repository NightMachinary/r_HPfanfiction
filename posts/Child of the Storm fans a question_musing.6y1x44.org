What do you think would happen if Harry, an Asgardian/Mage demigod gained the [[http://sot.wikia.com/wiki/Sword_of_Truth_(weapon][Sword of Truth]]), a weapon that essentially requires the wielder to unleash his anger and rage? Asgardians of the royal line are afflicted by the Warrior's Madness, a nearly incurable rage when they embrace their anger. "If pressed in battle, Thor is capable of entering into a state of Berserker Rage known as Warrior's Madness, which will temporarily increase his strength tenfold" but also removes all semblance of rational thought from what I understand.

The series is already a megacrossover, I can see this happening/being his weapon eventually.


** That would make his anger issues worse I think. Richard was someone who had very good anger management then learned to release it when needed while in child of the storm Harry is having anger management issues and the feedback loop of the sword would probably just send him into a berserk rage. Also all the crossovers for this series are based in our world which sword of truth is not so I don't think it would fit the world he's built

*** And his anger issues only got worse in the sequel but he's working on it.
