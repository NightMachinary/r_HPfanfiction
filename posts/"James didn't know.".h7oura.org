Said portret of Fleamont Potter.

"We spoiled him a bit too much."- added Euphemia.

"I always thought he was too young, or too inexperianced. Or just the time was bad. And oh it was, blood war and some other complications. But it was my duty, grandson."

Harry watched them quetly thinking what this was about. He just got to know that something of their family was left in his vaults. And once greetings were done, his granparent portraits accosted him straight away.

Watching them warily and using his finely tunned detector of history shaking-bs he asked- "What are you talking about?"

"Hmm, ah, yes. It's a bit difficult too talk about." Harry waved his hand.

"Good. So grandson you know that Potters are a wery old family." Harry resisted shaking his head.

"So our family history might be tiny bit misleading you know." Fleamont said while looking sheepish.

"Oh for the love of...!"- outburst came from Euphemia. "Potters are Slytherins. Leonard Slythering married a muggleborn, then his elder sisters son went on killing spree killing "tainted bloodline" as he thought, to become a "true heir Slytherin". He was from Gaunt family. So last living Leonard child, Beatrix changed family name through magic and so made Wizgamont forget. Then two generations of quiet living and the rest of the country forgot."

Hard eyes turned to Fleamont and murmed: "Simple succinct, could've told James in the first year, but noo."


** Okay, I'm a little confused. Is this a scene where some portraits of Harry's grandparents tell Harry that Potters are descended from Slytherin?
