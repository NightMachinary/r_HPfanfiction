Hello there people of hpff reddit, I've been off my fic game as of lately, life am i right, and after a few months not even going on tumblr I randomly decide to go on my old pal hpff to read something. It so happens that my luck is somehow inexistent because the day I randomly decide to go back to my old ways is the day hpff effectively closed down. Cue in desperation. Needless to say, I'm still stuck on the first stage of my grief: denial. Seeing as I didn't have time to save my fav fics, and I know I would had I been aware of the situation at hand, I'm sure loads of others who simply can't get enough of the potterverse (yes i called it) have. So this is call for help. If anyone has the files of (and doesn't mind sharing) the following:

Friendship for Dummies by Ellerina;

Devilish Delights, Wicked Ends. by GubraithianFire;

Napoleon's Complex by GubraithianFire;

The Horror! by GubraithianFire;

Off-Kilter by GubraithianFire;

The Morning Waffle by RonsGirlFriday;

Background Noise by teh tarik;

Raining by Harriet Hopkirk;

Welcome to Blunderland by peppersweet;

Bathing in Roses by celestie;

Some Kind of Beauty by celestie;

The Heartache Squadron by celestie;

It's Called Adventure by Aiedail;

Serenity Hill by Aiedail;

Morocco by Majikat.

I would love you forever. And I'm the loyal kind.

If you don't have one of the aforementioned beauties BUT would very much like to introduce me to your favs (that you do have saved) feel more than welcome!

Or even if you HAVE one of them saved but would like to share MORE with yours truly, there are no words really.
