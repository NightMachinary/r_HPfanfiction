Technically two people have survived the killing curse... wouldnt that mean that it is repeatable?

Tom Riddle pressed magic beyond what most have ever attempted.

Harry Potter was gifted with a brilliant mother who loved him like no other.

An interesting comparison. Love vs genius. Tom Riddle survived a reflected killing curse, and Harry bounced it back. Does that mean that both of them could be called Men who Lived?


** Yes, canon demonstrates there are two repeatable methods to survive the killing curse with one remaining in question.

The first two are through direct and indirect human sacrifice.

- Lily sacrifices herself in order that she can trade her life for Harry's.

- Voldemort creates a horcrux through an act of murder, trading the person who he murder's life for his own.

In either case, the curse's life debt is paid. Clearly, Avade Kedavra does not require that the one struck by the curse is the one to pay the life debt.

The third method to survive the killing curse is left up to debate. Does Harry survive the killing curse the second time because:

- He is the master of death, and/or he is the rightful owner of the elder wand and cannot be killed with it
- The life debt is paid by Voldemort's Horcrux

Canon seems to indicate the first option, but that doesn't seem to go with the established methods to survive the curse. This is why I maintain that the Deathly Hallows are McGuffins, added to the story in order to drive the plot, because they do not conform to the narrative defined in the first book.

It makes more sense to consider that Voldemort's Horcrux pays the penalty of death. If this is taken as true, there are some interesting intuitions that can be extrapolated.

- A partial soul can pay the Piper's fee for the killing curse

- Lily's sacrifice pays the price for both the killing curse that allowed Harry to survive and the killing curse to create the horcrux within Harry.

Through these facts we come to the following conclusions:

1. Life debts and sacrifices in the form of both a killing curse and horcrux are a trading of souls, not the trading of life.

2. The debt must be paid, but it doesn't matter by whom.

3. The debt does not require a 1-to-1 trade of souls.

4. One could survive the killing curse by trading a soul shard, either their own or somebody else's.

5. The debt does not distinguish between intentional (Lily) and unintentional (Voldemort's victims) giving of souls.

6. The killing curse destroys the soul and imparts to physical damage to the vessel.

7. The Killing Curse appears to be some form of soul magic, but it really does have some limitations.

8. Lily's sacrifice appears to be a form of soul magic, but we don't know if her sacrifice was premeditated or an act of passion.

This gives us a bit of incite into how soul magic works, and with some assumptions we can intuit a lot of information from it. I wouldn't mind sitting down and really thinking through the problem. One could write a pretty in depth technical fic where Harry (Or Tom) delves deeply into soul magic.

*** This assumes that soul magic is how it worked for both the AK, and Lily's sacrifice.

It would be interesting to acknowledge that BOUNCING the curse only leaves a scar, something that the AK does not normally do. Could that be a back lash of the debt being paid by the intentional sacrifice? Also I remember that Lily was killed by an AK. her soul would have been severed from her body. Again assuming the AK works on soul magic. (I have not seen that it has. Maybe someone can link that info to me) Wouldnt that render your Lily sacrificial theory moot?

Interesting thought. Can one conclude that it is the act of the soul deformation that leaves a physical impact. Does canon explicitly state that Voldemort looked normal before his resurrection (I'd always assumed that was the result of his resurrection)? If not, maybe there were other physical side effects that are not stated.

***** He certainly didn't look snakelike, but as I said below I believe his looks were changed in some way before he was resurrected, as early as when he was applying for the DADA position from Dumbledore.

***** When he applied for the DADA job with Dumbledore, he looked older... But Dumbledore never states if he looks different to him. One may draw the conclusion that the resurrection ritual was what changed his appearance. It would make the most sense as he was resurrected from a fetus based homunculus into a blood and bone based one.

I think it comes down to intent personally. Lily intended for Harry to live at all costs. Therefore, the magic she enacted was stronger than Tom's intent on killing Harry. That would allow the AK to bounce, as it would still get the soul debt fulfilled, however a curse that powerful cannot be fully blocked... thus the open wound that a portion of Tom's decrepit soul attached too; not a full horcrux, as the murder was not intended for the creation of a horcrux, but enough for the sliver to survive. If we went by that, then we can then use Tom's intent when making horcuxes was to live. That could be what makes Horcuxes so powerful and specific to create. The intent require would be to much for most.

This explanation would also explain Harry's survival. He gets hit by the AK, but his INTENT isnt to die, it is remove Tom's accidental horcrux. If he must die, so be it. Of course he is presented the same choice I am willing to bet Tom was offered when the AK was reflected back: Pass on, and leave this world behind. Or go back. Harry, with an unblemished soul, got to go back to his body, but Tom, whose body was destroyed by the backlash of the AK attempting to separate his whole soul from this world and not being able to. It would be like setting off a bomb in a container unable to take the explosive pressure exerted.

I think it comes down to intent, along with your idea of the Avada Kedavara curse separating A soul from this world.

All evidence points to it being a full horcrux

Voldemort would never choose death over life. He lived as a shade for 13 years and as a homunculus for 1 more

I guess my theory doesn't really account for Voldemort's last killing curse. You might be able to stretch it saying that though the spell hit Harry, the two of them are connected by blood, so the killing curse could have taken either Harry or Voldemort's soul as payment, and Voldemort's soul was taken as it was in a more fragile container and his soul was weakened. Harry also had more of his own blood and therefore was afforded more of Lily's blood protection that Voldemort. Voldemort's body was nothing more than a transfigured container for a soul, and therefore disintegrated upon his soul's departure.

I guess that's reaching, but I still like my theory better than JK's flimsy, inconsistent explanation.

I think his intention had to be to die, otherwise the protective magical effect for everyone in Hogwarts wouldn't have kicked in.

You say this, but IIRC when Harry was viewing one of Dumbledore's memories in HBP, he noted how Tom's appearance had changed when he went to apply for the DADA position. I'll try to find the relevant section. That would imply that his use of the dark arts, whether Horcruxes specifically or something else, was the cause of his changes.

EDIT: found it:

  His features were not those Harry had seen emerge from the great stone cauldron almost two years ago: They were not as snakelike, the eyes were not yet scarlet, the face not yet masklike, and yet he was no longer handsome Tom Riddle. It was as though his features had been burned and blurred; they were waxy and oddly distorted, and the whites of the eyes now had a permanently bloody look, though the pupils were not yet the slits that Harry knew they would become.

*** Horcruxes are an interesting bit of magic. When the killing curse impacts Voldemort's body, the bit of soul inside him is not destroyed--only his body is.

His six horcruxes (ignoring the Harrycrux) and own bit of soul remain "undamaged". He becomes a wraith and then is returned to his body years later in a ritual, suffering no permanent damage.

Lily's is harder to put together. I don't buy the literal interpretation of a love shield. Aside from the idea being ridiculous, it seems unbelievable that no other mother would give their life for their child.

Rather, I'd believe it to be a ritual sacrifice of the "my life for the protection of my child" kind. Harry's survival is also possibly a Fate/prophecy thing. Trelawney made a true prophecy about Voldemort and Harry, and it wasn't Harry's time to die.

Assuming Lily did something, her sacrifice wouldn't specifically counteract the killing curse, it specifically counteracted a person: Voldemort, her killer. The cost was also greater.

To create a horcrux, Voldemort killed someone else and did an unnamed ritual. To protect her child, Lily offered herself; at least her body, maybe her soul, too.

To survive his death, Voldemort loses his body. To survive his death, Harry gets a scar. Lily's protection is seemingly higher level of protection for higher level of cost, but far less versatile. So things don't really seem proportional.

As for the Harrycrux, it's hard to determine which route JKR is taking. You have the deus ex machines (Hallows), Lily's protection could still be active (it just had a different result because of the truly untested nature of such magic), the Harrycrux explanation, or Harry's willing sacrifice of himself caused another love shield (picking the more literal interpretation of Lily's sacrifice and the prophecy).

I personally, like to choose the second. It seems the least contrived, even if it is potentially contradicted by canon (cuz the Harrycrux personification in the "crossroads betwixt life and death").

JKR seems to be pushing option one, three, four, or some combination. I feel like she's using love metaphorically, not literally, and wants to leave that avenue open to cause a warm, fuzzy feeling in the reader. Maybe she couldn't decide between one and three and so just stuck both in and left it ambiguous to give us something to think about? Hard, if not impossible, to determine authorial intent.
