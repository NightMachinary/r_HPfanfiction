I was thinking of some noble ambitions for a daring and overly ambitious character which led me into thinking about what is considered impossible even in the wizarding world. The things I can think of are:

1) /Bringing back the dead/ This we hear from Dumbledore himself to be impossible so seems to be the most impossible thing in the world.

2)/Self-propelled flight/ Before Voldemort made it happen in Deathly Hallows I imagine this too was considered nigh-impossible.

3) /Conjuring food/ There's a whole law about it, isn't there?

4) /Curing lycanthropy/ Everyone seems resigned enough to the condition by now that I am pretty sure the general consensus is that isn't possible.

5)/Turning someone non-magical into a magical-being/ The whole society arrangement seems to scream that even thinking this possible is lunacy.

Are there any more things that I am missing? I am trying to take most of my clues from Canon but I reckon a little bit of speculation never hurt anyone.

Honorable mention: /curing injuries caused by dark magic/ I didn't include that in the list because though it's certainly considered hard, they at least attempt it which means it is considered probable that something could be healed. Or maybe it's just extreme healer ethics or something.


** The honorable mention and the curing lycanthropy are pretty much the same thing, tbh. Being a werewolf is a contagious curse, I think. Something along the lines of being unable to fully heal wounds/injuries caused by dark magic ex. the Longbottoms, Harry's scar, and probably the map on Dumbledore's knee.

Can't create things of value. I believe they deteriorate faster.

Can't create real love.

Sidenote: I wish JKR would tell us the rest of gamp's law and the remaining wizarding schools.

Edit: self propelled flight isn't impossible. I believe JKR said it just takes great skill in wandless magic.

*** The issue is if JK decided to tell us the rest of Gamp's laws and the remaining wizarding schools, she'd have to come up with them on the spot, and she'd likely do so in a way that was inconsistent, hugely flawed and made an attempt at being woke and just ended up being offensive.

Because that's worldbuilding, and unless she's doing it narrowly in service of plot convenience, JK hates that.

*** That makes me wonder if we can't create things of value (which seems weird as I always think of value as something a person assigns to things) or if the things that deteriorate faster are the things that got assigned any significant value in the first place?

Maybe earth wasn't so abundant in most metals but things that stuck around seemed to pile up and become less valuable to muggles while things that even wizards couldn't sustainably increase are the only rare things left in the world.

Side question: Do you remember where this was mentioned?

***** Yeah, I see. I guess conjured things don't last and everything else about value is similar to muggle world.

BTW, it seemed to me in the book that flying was a nigh-impossible thing to do as they did not even expect Voldemort to be able to do it. Also Voldemort taught it to Snape and I can't remember Snape being any good at wandless magic.

*** I think it's far more likely that older wizards/witches use enchanted glasses. Harry James and Percy are the only children we see with glasses, as far as I can remember. Harry is oblivious enough to not think about fixing his sight and the Weasleys might not be able to afford the fix. No clue why James might have chosen not to fix his sight but it seems more likely than a society that can regrow bones not fixing eyesight.

** Pretty sure you Magic can't be stolen. With enough trauma, you can stop someone to use his magic, but at this point this person would probably be completely destroyed mentally (like Longbottoms level), and he would still be magical (can't use spell but able to see ghost and dementors, or fly a broom . . .).

Concerning the Dark Art injuries, I always wondered if the amputation was viable. Let's take Dumbledore exemple, if he had cut his arm above the cursed part, would it have stopped the spreading of it, and would it had been possible for him to later regrown the arm (can limbs even be regrown if not lost because of dark magic?)

#+end_quote

Technically it is kinda possible. Depending on your definition, of course. Inferi are a thing. And you can also contact their souls(?) via priori incantatem (book 4, Lilly and James talked to Harry), Ressurection stone(Once again, they talked with Harry). However this forms of magic are extremely rare and depend on your definition of "bringing back the dead".

#+begin_quote
  2)Self-propelled flight Before Voldemort made it happen in Deathly Hallows I imagine this too was considered nigh-impossible.
#+end_quote

As far as I know, this is entirely correct. It was thought to be impossible.

#+begin_quote
  3) Conjuring food There's a whole law about it, isn't there?
#+end_quote

Yes, but you can dublicate food, summon it, transfigure it, ect. So it really doesn't matter. If you have some, dublicate it. If not, transfigure a rock into a sandwitch.

#+begin_quote
  4) Curing lycanthropy Everyone seems resigned enough to the condition by now that I am pretty sure the general consensus is that isn't possible.
#+end_quote

Well that depends. I'd assume many years ago, they would have thought that supressing the symptoms was impossible. Yet, Wolfsbane was created. One should note it's also a fairly recent creation. I'm sure it's possible to cure it, just increadibly hard and dangerous.

#+begin_quote
  5)Turning someone non-magical into a magical-being The whole society arrangement seems to scream that even thinking this possible is lunacy.
#+end_quote

Yes, that would seem impossible. They have to be born magical....they have to be born better.

As far as I know, it is impossible. Quote:

"Mrs. Weasley looked around and said, ‚ÄúI can't make it grow back, not when it's been removed by Dark Magic. But it could have been so much worse. . . . He's alive.‚Äù

Hermione considers it impossible to transfigure a Dragon, but she is only guessing and has no actual proof

"The trouble is, like that book said, not much is going to get through a dragon's hide. . . . I'd say Transfigure it, but something that big, you really haven't got a hope, I doubt even Professor McGonagall. . . "

Bringing back the dead and Conjuring food are two things that are /impossible/, and Curing Lycanthropy is something that nobody has discovered yet.

Its not impossible to bring back the dead if you draw the line further than you did. Harry came back from the dead.

When I said 'impossible' it was how flying was considered impossible for a long time.

** This is a subtle distinction, but I think it's impossible to conjure something that has never existed. For instance, a sorcerer who was really impressed with the Xenomorphs in the Alien movies might be able to fashion a statue of one, probably made of clay and glaze; and he might be able to animate it like a puppet, but he wouldn't be able to bring it to life.
