** lulu42's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4438449/1/Path-of-Decision][Path of Decision]] has an assassin Harry. 244k words, complete. Crossover with Gaiman's /Sandman/ series, though you probably can get by with just skimming the wiki page.

  Voldemort is in power, but the Wizarding World fights back. Harry Potter, Master of Death, is faced with a choice, move forward or change everything? Sandman Crossover COMPLETED!

** It might not be necessarily a funny male Veela Harry story, but it is a very good one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4228464/1/Desperate-Measures][Desperate Measures]] by vvc.

It is a Harry/Draco story and technically is a male pregnancy story... but, trust me, it also technically isn't. One way or the other the pregnancy doesn't happen until 2/3 into the fic and you get an explanation of how it happens in chapter 4. You'll have lots of time to decide if it'll squick you or not without having to invest all the time it'd take to get 2/3 done.

All in all, a very good Veela fic, a very good Draco/Harry fic, a (surprisingly) good m-preg fic (I know right!), and a story I've come back to more than once.

** Another assassin-Harry story I ran across today is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3659524/1/A-Shadowed-Soul][A Shadowed Soul]] by devilblondie; 93k words, WIP. It's clumsily written (the author seems to mix and match present and past tense; also, much of the exposition is schlocky and melodramatic), but possibly readable in the context of the OP's request.

  He was abandoned at a young age, the world believing him dead. They were wrong. Death Eaters believed untouchable are dying. Who is this assassin? Will he join Dumbledore or take the war into his own hands? Not typical powerful!politic!Harry.
