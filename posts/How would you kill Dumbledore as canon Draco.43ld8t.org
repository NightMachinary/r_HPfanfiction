Inspired by the "is Draco intelligent" thread.

Your challenge is as follows: you are Draco Malfoy. You have been sworn in as a Death Eater by Voldemort himself, but he's given you a mission that seems impossible to fulfill: you have to kill one of the greatest wizards in the world, Albus Dumbledore. Failure will result in execution of not only you, but probably also the rest of your family down the line.

You have enjoyed 5 years of Hogwarts education so far; your OWLs were good, but not beyond compare, and among the NEWT classes you qualify for are Potions, DADA, and Transfiguration.

Beyond that you also know Occlumency, taught to you by Bellatrix, and you have some knowledge of Dark magic, passed down by your father.

Your resources are the dwindling fortunes of the Malfoy family. You can count on some minor help by other Death Eaters, though they expect you to do all the heavy lifting.

Other people you can call on are your mother, Aunt Bella, and Severus Snape. Your father, currently in Azkaban, is beyond your reach. At school, you can count on Crabbe and Goyle; other Slytherins may or may not support The Cause.

Additional restrictions: no muggle weaponry. Let's not start that particular shitstorm again, and besides it'd be really out of character for Draco. The only things you can use are those that appeared in canon. Using fanon would defeat the point.

tl;dr: How would you go about murdering Albus Dumbledore?


** All of the solutions offered thus far seem rather... obvious and simple. Too much so.

Regardless of how intelligent, resourceful, and clever Draco is, I'm pretty sure Dumbledore is /more/ so. Also, I'm pretty sure that Dumbledore has had more enemies than Draco, and therefore has had more reasons to be concerned about possible assassination over the years. Even in Hogwarts.

If house elves were easy to bewitch, he'd have some way of dealing with it. If the food were that easy to adulterate, he'd have defenses (like a ring or amulet that vibrated in the presence of illict potions, poisons, etc.). If leaving a trap outside his office were that easy, he'd be in the habit of casting detection spells - especially now that Voldemort is back!

The reason why the Vanishing Cabinet works (aside from taking a year, making it an excellent plot device) is the fact that it's completely outside Dumbledore's knowledge and experience of the castle. He knows about a room that gives him lots of chamber pots, but not a room of "lost things" with potentially dangerous items in it. He has no reason to put up general defenses or warnings of intruders already inside the castle because they would have to get through any number of defenses on the outside first, by which time their presence would be known.

Draco's solution has to be something that Dumbledore isn't an expert in (transfiguration) or probably already watching for (poison, traps). It has to be something he can't reasonably expect because it's something he's unaware of. Even the Chamber of Secrets probably has some sort of warning spell on the sink, because he's aware of it and can't assume that there's no second exit that leads outside the castle.

*** Well the plain fact of the matter is that Draco is not smart enough to kill Dumbledore.

To kill someone as canny as Dumbledore you would have to be /extremely/ creative and capable of lateral thinking in order to get the drop on him, something Draco simply is not capable of. You would have to be aware of his habits and patterns and strike at a moment when Dumbledore was paying the least attention, information Draco could not possibly find.

The only reason Draco knows about the Vanishing Cabinet is sheer luck, from what I know. One of the other Slytherins got stuck in there and came out in Borgin's and Burke's. So the entire situation was, as everyone knew, punishment for Draco because of his father's failings.

That could be a weakness: find a potion that doesn't set it off, but under the right circumstances could still prove lethal. A potion that's harmless unless it interacts with certain other substances? Given Dumbledore's fondness for sweets, perhaps something that turns to poison when it interacts with processed sugar. (Put the poison on/in something else, obviously, so he eats it and it reacts only when Dumbledore then eats something sweet.) Alternately, a medical potion that's essentially harmless... unless given to an old man who might, perhaps, have a weaker heart or various other problems that accompany age.

I also think you could catch him out with something he doesn't expect to be a trick. Given F&G's shop recently opening up, there's probably a lot of their stuff being used about the castle that year and if Dumbledore's familiar with some bits (and I totally believed he would be) then he could pick something up without suspicion. I'm not imaginative to come up with anything (although my brain keeps coming back to jinxed whoopee cushions...) but I'm sure there must be something from the twins' shop that can be modified after purchase to become potentially lethal. If it appears to be just the right amount of 'cheeky student prank' without being suspiciously innocent looking, it could just catch him out.

** Honestly, probably go to Snape and try to figure out something.

If that failed, I'm usually the kind of person to try to read and find out about as much stuff as possible, so I would probably head into the Hogwarts library (especially the restricted section), family library, Diagon Alley library (there's gotta be one), and find something that could be used, and would probably find something like the vanishing cabinet.

If I found nothing, I'd get desperate and just lie on the Astronomy Tower day and night and try to snipe Dumbledore with a curse he wouldn't see coming when leaving school or something.

Or... you know... transfigure an anvil to a piece of gum, fix it onto the ceiling of the Great Hall above Dumbledore's seat, and revert the transfiguration during breakfast.

Edit: I just thought of something else, more in the vein of Slytherin thinking. All food is prepared by the house elves, and I imagine not all of them hold Dumbledore in such a high regard as Dobby. In any case, one could be intimidated, or bewitched to slip some poison into Dumbledore's morning pumpkin juice. Something so quick even Snape would not have time to save him from. Good old fashioned elf abuse and poison.

** Canon Draco came up with a good plan. He just didn't go far enough.

I know Dumbledore likely has ways of sensing active spells and known assassination techniques. It is pointless to even try magical poisons or cursed item traps.

So I just keep sending Imperius'd students at him.

I use a series of cut-outs that are Imperius'd to cast that same spell on a student, then I wipe the cut-out's memory of everything that just happened.

The attackers are all forced to take slow-acting but fatal potions just ahead of the attacks, then are given a cursed knife, a powerful spell to cast from ambush, or just a fragile vial of Exploding Fluid to hide under their shirt and orders to give the Headmaster a big hug.

Magical suicide bombers. I get bonus evil points for using first years on that one.

That's my best plan, the first one I'll try, and one I won't stop using even as I keep up the other angles of attack. Best of all, I can set up dozens of attacks ahead of time and just let them fire off all at the same time or even slowly, one by one, so by the time everything starts getting locked down and I'm (obviously) under suspicion, I don't need to do anything else to keep the attacks coming.

Hell, he might not survive a strong first attempt. I'm thinking having magic-reactive, Exploding Fluid soaked clothing for the brainwashed students would be a good idea. Given my OOC knowledge of his past, I think it would work even better than Draco could know as Dumbledore tries to stun a student, sets off the potion in their clothing with his spell (this is a canon reaction, remember), then has a heroic BSoD because of his history with his sister.

Then the second wave of spell, knife, and exploding students take Dumbledore out. Hell, even if he somehow survives, as the student body count rises Dumbledore will eventually get either sloppy in fending off an attack or let one kill him simply to stop any more students from getting hurt.

--------------

*edit

Anyway, I think it is clear that the canon Draco doesn't actually want to do this murder Dumbledore thing. Even though my plan is cold, it is blunt. I don't know much about the world. I'm sure if he wanted, he could have done something much sneakier and more effective than what he ended up doing in canon. Hell, those two attempts, the poison and the necklace, might have been ideas from Crabbe and Goyle themselves. They certainly weren't very smart.

** +If I have knowledge about canon and my real life self, then I'll wait till the end of year's plot and kill him at the astronomy tower. If I am literally Draco Malfoy, then my actions will repeat his canon actions.+

From this follows that my motivation for killing him is to save the lives of my family members. In such a scenario, I think my most likely choice would not be killing him, but things like leaving our illiquid assets behind and emigrating --- or actually trying to work with either Dumbledore, ICW, or both. Among the reasons for this is the fact that even if I did manage to kill him, Voldemort would still be considered an illegitimate ruler by the rest of the magical world because of how heavy-handed his tactics were. Risking to get free from this person with lost sanity that sees his minions as disposable and often tortures\kills them himself would be preferable to me than trying to satisfy his short-term goals and orders.

But let's assume that these first choices are not an option either and that for some reason I absolutely need to have him killed and kill him myself.^{1}

- I'd put multiple people (both schoolchildren of various years and staff members) under Imperio, then use them for a simultaneous AK attack on him from various angles in the Great Hall.
- some 30-40 minutes before that, I'd gather DE hatchlings and order them to spawn fiendfire in the castle, planning it in a way to guide Dumbledore's actions, make him risk his life in fighting it and protecting children (mostly Hufflepuffs and Griffindors), and mitigate risks for those people that Voldemort would be interested in having alive. Many competent staff members would be rendered useless before this by some means like poisoning to reduce the available number of helping hands for him. In the midst of this chaos a polyjuiced junior DE would also try to get close enough to Dumbledore to give him a Portkey that sends into some extremely destructive environment (e.g. bottom of the Mariana Trench).
- Several hours before that, I'd make an Unbreakable Vow with people I trust. It would be formulated something like this: “If the first several steps of my plan fail, I Vow to a) try and catch Harry Potter as a hostage and render him unconsciousness, b) offer Dumbledore to kill himself in exchange for Potter's life, c-1) kill Potter if Dumdledore refuses, c-2) let Potter go and not attack him any further for at least 24 hours if Dumdledore complies and kills himself.” Then, if all my other plans failed, after all, I'd (try to) capture Potter and drop my Occlumency in front of Dumbledore to let him know that if he doesn't kill himself, I will be required to do my best to kill Potter (who is already unconscious in my hands and at a wand point).

edit: I'd go with a plan like this because I'd assume that Dumbledore had survived many assassination attempts on his life both during his war with Grindelwald and later with Voldemort. So it's extremely hard to catch him off-balance and next to impossible to get him with classical assassination schemes (like the poisoned drink that canon!Draco came up with).

edit: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9079271/1/The-Last-Straw-Oneshot][/The Last Straw/]] is a relevant one-shot I'd recommend reading.

** Hit him with an AK. :)

It seems the most direct way to kill someone and even Dumbledore can't block it.

Draco would just have to figure out a way to get close enough to Dumbledore, preferably alone, and then an exit strategy. Polyjucing himself as a professor might get him alone in Dumbledore's office long enough to do it. I think Draco had the right idea with his vanishing cabinet plan in the books. He did have Dumbledore at wandpoint iirc, but he's not a killer and couldn't do it.

** This is a no win situation for Draco. Dumbledore is the most powerful and experienced wizard in the world. The only way I could see him even comming close to killing Dumbledore is to curse him in front of everyone. During a feast or something. Simply walk up, get as close as possible and hope that he can properly use the killing curse. There is no trick that Draco is capable of. He would have to seize the chance when Dumbledore is relaxed and hope to catch an old man off guard. If he was ever alone, Dumbledore would expect something and easily wipe the floor with him.

** Honestly? I'm probably sticking with the canon plan. Sneaking in a bunch of murderous people far more skilled at magic than I am seems like a much better approach than poisoning or cursed items.

However, if we are deviating from canon, I'm going to go with a fairly simple approach. We know Draco can use the imperius curse well enough, so I would use it on a younger student. We know he has a stock of polyjuice, so I polyjuice myself as someone not suspicious(a random Hufflepuff probably). I then use the younger student to distract Dumbledore, and shoot a killing curse at his back.

If I wanted to get complicated, I'd probably gather a few trustworthy junior DE's, get the hairs of a group of Hufflepuffs, and use polyjuice to imitate them. Then have the entire group shoot killing curses at Dumbledore's back. I still stick with a random younger student under the imperius curse as the initial distraction.

I just can't see poison or traps ever getting to Dumbledore while he is in Hogwarts. He's lived through two wars, was an important person in multiple parts of the gov't for 50+ years, and was well hated by people who would happily kill to solve their problems. Draco's original method was one of the few that had a chance of working.

** Since we know he can get his hands on poison: I think I'd go for non-standard poison delivery - contact poison on his chair in the great hall (probably at the ends of the arms where his hands would rest), or possibly poisoning the cutlery (rather than the food). Depending if the table is set before people arrive - as the staff table might be.

Or, as seen in a book once, contact poison on a doorknob - one that has to build up, so occasional visitors wouldn't be affected (I'm presuming his office door here). Hmm, could you sabotage Floo powder so the fire looked right, but actually burned you when you stepped in? Although, with Fawkes in the office, that might be futile.

No, I think the magical equivalent to heavy-metal poisoning might be best - by the time they figured out what was happening, it might be irreversible. And the onset would be slow and might be marked up to age, depending on symptoms. And a contact poison would be harder to detect (surely not even Moody would cast a detection spell on /every item he touched/).

** Potion ingredients from the student stores. I'm good at potions, better than most, at least by this year. I mean while Harry is essentially cheating, Hermione and I are the only ones getting "acceptable".

I know Snape is required to help me, and I'm not above abusing that (at least in the books) and he /is/ the longtime potions master - but not this year, so he doesn't know what my assignments are. He's also my head of house.

I can cite my need for help with potions homework (Slughorn assigned poisons and antidotes first class) and steal the supplies/poisons.

Poison failed once, no one is expecting it again. By 6th year we all know how to filch food from the kitchens. My former house elf is still there, and still (at least in the books) finds it hard to resist obeying my family. There are other house elves, as well - I'm used to abusing the things, and I know they obey all the students and staff.

I constantly get owls with sweets, and everyone knows Dumbledork has a fondness for them. I dose some, whether they be chocolates or some other sweet, and give them to a house elf.

Instruct the pathetic creature to deliver the sweets to the Headmaster's office, secretly, with a note, as they are a treat from Madam Pince (the librarian) for Valentine's day.

I'm already smoothly adept at lies and deceit, I can arrange to meet with Dumbledore shortly after (or during) the house elf's delivery.

Yes, Dumbledon't would be able to cure himself, but that takes precious seconds in which I can disarm and immobilize him in a weakened state. While he is unable to react, I - being unable to actually speak a killing curse, am not against summoning a serpent to do my work for me. We already know I can do that, I did it as a child.

The snake can (and will, of course) attack Dumbledweeb. He's poisoned now. (Wait, wasn't he poisoned before?) No, because I've seen all these twitterpated little girls trying to slip /Potter/ love potions, and that's what I dosed the sweets with.

That's why Dumbledisease doesn't detect my "poison" - it isn't one. And even if I don't succeed in immobilizing him, he's hardly going to resist while he's gaga for me. It's gross to me (Malfoys are against everything) but no more so than turning Crabbe and Goyle into my adoring fangirls.

I can use the floo network, which we know from /Potter's/ antics while Umbridge was here, are perfectly operational within the Professors' offices, even now, to speak to a few Death Eaters and bring them in (without the need of a Vanishing Cabinet)

If my plot /fails/ and Dumbledour doesn't eat the sweets, he won't know how they got into the office, and I can say I'm there to gripe about Slugface.

If it succeeds, I've got Dumbledysentery writhing on the ground and a billion Death Eaters in the Headmaster's office, before the portraits have time to bring help (which they will, allowing my Death Eaters to pick off the professors by ones and twos).

If this plan fails, however, all I would need to do is name literally every sweet in the world while Dumbledummy is away on one of his many trips, since /everyone/ knows he uses them as passwords, and set traps in his office.

It shouldn't be hard to get an invisibility cloak, because, although /Potter's/ is a Deathly Hallow, they /do/ exist (although rare, as we learned when Potter got his) and I'm a rich little prat with resources to get another.

With the cloak, the portraits wouldn't know I'd been in the office and they comprise literally half the security of the Headmaster's office.

With my cloak still on, (before or after) I'd sit outside the Gryffindor fat woman and wait for someone to go inside, follow them, and plant all the evidence under /Potter's/ mattress.
