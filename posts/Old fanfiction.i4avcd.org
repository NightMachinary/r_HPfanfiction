I'm looking for an old fanfiction. It was about how Harry became King of Britain because all monarchs had wizards sworn to serve them and Harry didn't like that.

He then went on to conquer all of Europe and kick out or enslave all non magicals.

It ends with Hermione and the Americans attacking Harry 50 years later.

Please leave a link if found.
