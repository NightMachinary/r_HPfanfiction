******* Why wouldn't I? I don't even know what I might like considering that I have never read a x-over of those 3 with HP. And I didn't search either, Reddit was my first option cuz in general, suggestions are what ppl like, and that has highest probability of being a good fic. At least good enough to BE suggested. I do say one thing. I'm a sucker for romance, het or femslash, though not a fan of harem, unless its extremely welldone, which I've seen about 5 times in over 800 fics I've read.

  The 5th Heaven's Feel has been averted, with no apparent victor, but for Herwald von Einzbern, recently turned eleven, a whole new adventure is about to begin in a world he left behind ten years prior. AU cross, rated T for occasional german cursing.

Matou Shinji, the protagonist, is unable to become magus and that makes him a failure to his family. He would completely break, but he gets a letter from Hogwarts. Wanting praise and attention he focuses on giving his best to succeed at witchcraft. Will he obtain what he seeks? What will come with his friendship with Boy-Who-Lives? And why Hogwarts? Featuring two Voldemorts, rapist tanuki, Draco Malfoy working part-time at Saint Mungo and assassin creating elite school club. Nice blend of obscure elements of both settings with author's original ideas. Features Mahoutokoro, Durmstrang, and original magical school. Ongoing, with currently irregular updates.

  Ladies of Eternity, magi of the past hiding in the present. Those words describe Witches in the Moonlit world, with their daughters inheriting their role without exceptions. But this is a story of a Witch's son -- a boy tossed aside by cruel fate. A boy who dreamed of becoming a magus, but failed. A boy, who carves his path through blood and wand. A Boy, a Potter, and a Thief.

** I never thought that Harry Potter was all that good a world for crossovers.

THe world of Fate/Stay Night, on the other hand, is pretty ideal for crossovers. So a HP/FSN crossover would work, but only if you brought Harry or some other character over as Caster. I might be interested in reading that if anyone knows of any fanfics along that vein.
