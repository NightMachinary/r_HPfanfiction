I remember reading a fic where Harry travels to an alternate universe where his parents are alive and Ginny is in Azkaban for opening the Chamber of Secrets. Sirius trains him to become an Animaigus and he rescues Ginny by drinking polyjuice potion and changing his appearance to look like her. I forgot what it was called but I want to read it again.

  Destroy the Horcruxes---that's Harry's goal, until an Aperio throws him and two other unknown people into a world where the prophecy never existed, his parents and Sirius are alive, and Ginny went to Azkaban for opening the Chamber. Canon pairings, preDH.
