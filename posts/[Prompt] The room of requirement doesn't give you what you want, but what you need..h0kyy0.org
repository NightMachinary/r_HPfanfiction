** A super stressed out Harry goes to the room of requirement for a DA meeting. Instead finds a massage parlor with a trained therapist.

** Harry opened the door. The room behind was sparse to say the least. In the center was a table, with a box, a rather nasty looking dagger and a piece of parchment.

Harry stepped up to the table and read the parchment. It seemed to be a list of items, with one crossed out:

Diary, crossed out

Diadem, in box next to list

Locket, inside number 12, Grimmauld Place (ask Kreatcher to destroy it)

Ring, in Gaunt shack, Little Hangleton (heavily cursed)

Cup, in Lestrange vault, Gringots (goblins don't like soul magic)

Snake, in Malfoy Manor

Scar, Harry potter's forehead (consult expert on possessions)

The diary... Wait... If these were all like the diary..

Taking the hint, Harry picked up the dagger, and opened the box. Inside was an old tiara of some kind. He immediately stabbed it with the dagger.

It screamed.

He knew that scream.

Picking up the list (he noticed that it now had 'diadem' crossed out) and stuffing the now somewhat twisted tiara into a pocket, he started off towards Dumbledores office. May as well dump the entire thing on his lap and make him do the plan foiling for a change.

Harry returned to the room after a rather bewildered Dumbledore accepted the various items and explanation. There was something different this time.

A book, entitled "coups for beginners or what to do if the government is working with terrorists". Huh.

Harry settled down to read.

*** I doubt there's a basilisk venom infused dagger in there, probably just a book on fiendfire "Cursed fire and you, a beginner's guide to immolating the opposition"

**** I can see someone losing their goblin-made dagger. And the room being able to retrieve other things in the school is a fanon staple, as the basilisk is dead in chamber of secrets.

***** Who says that basilisks are all that rare? If I remember my mythology correctly, all you have to do to breed one is hatch a chicken egg that's been sitting under a toad. The MoM's Restriction Against Experimental Breeding aside, the Wizarding World should be rife with "exotic" snakes and such.

***** Perhaps it's a blessed dagger, or enchanted in some way it also destroys Horcruxes, perhaps forged by the same guy that made Excalibur and Merlin ended up misplacing it.

After all they do say "all the /known/ ways" not "the /only/ ways" to destroy a Horcrux.
