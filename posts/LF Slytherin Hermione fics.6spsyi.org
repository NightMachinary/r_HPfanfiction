Fics where Hermione actively embraces what being a Slytherin is about, like in Applied Cultural Anthropology or Colubrina's The Green Girl. I've been looking for these, but it seems as though I've been running out...


** linkao3(The King's Indian Attack by Nectere) might be right up your alley. linkao3(The Anti-Heroine by cheshire_carroll) is super dark, but a very Slytherin Hermione.

I also have one completed Slytherin Hermione fic, linkffn(Mudsnake) and I have one that's a WIP with multiple POV including a Slytheirn Hermione linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn).

  "Whatever you decide to say, make it believable." Hermione Granger learned to avoid the hard questions years ago. To her, Hogwarts is a relief: a new school with new people who have no knowledge of her past...only, they keep asking the hard questions. And it's getting harder for Hermione to maintain the lies. Featuring: Mentor!Snape and Slytherin!Hermione. Over 75k hits!

  Aurora Sinistra spends most of her time watching the stars. She's no centaur, but she's better than Trelawney. In the summer of 1991, she has a plan redeem the reputation of Slytherin House, and maybe some of the people inside it. Recruiting Severus Snape to help her over a game of chess, the two teachers undertake a gambit of their own that leads the Boy-Who-Lived and the Brightest Witch of Her Age into Slytherin House and friendships with Draco Malfoy. However, there is something strange going on at the school. Can the three figure out what it is that Professor Quirrell is up to and stop it? How will the changes in House and friendships effect Harry's relationship with Dumbledore and the headmaster's plans?

  Hermione Granger knows she's not a good person. Disillusioned with life at only twelve years old; she is cynical, manipulative, ruthless and, above all else, a survivor. For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.  Main Pairing: Harry Potter/Hermione Granger/Tom Riddle

** Can I advocate my own, linkao3(Hermione Granger and the Serpent's Renaissance: No bed of roses), in which Hemione is Salazar Slytherin reborn

PS. I've seen a quite a few recommendations for Fiye_Autumne's Mudsnake. It sounds like a good story

  They don't question why Hermione Granger is able to cast every spell in the first class, or why she seems to know Hogwarts: A History by heart. They never really notice her resourcefulness, determination or cunning. A Gryffindor meant for Ravenclaw, they call her- and yet...Who would've thought that once upon a time, her name was Salazar?Year 2: Reborn and reacquainted with the magical world as Hermione Granger, Salazar has so far made some progress in debunking her supposed support for blood-purism. She has also kindled a careful friendship between Blaise Zabini, Daphne Greengrass, Theodore Nott, and Harry Potter. However, just about everything she's stood for is still buried under centuries of bad press and ignominy earned by her successors. This must change. Dragging a corrupted legacy out of the mud will be no bed of roses. Nevertheless, a hardy rose can revive from just a branch...

** Brilliant Magic by LJ Summers on FFN. Its a Fred/Hermione/George soulbond fic with Hermione in Slytherin. Don't know if this is what you meant, but it's an excellent story nonetheless.
