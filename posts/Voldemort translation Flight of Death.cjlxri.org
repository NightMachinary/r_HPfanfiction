Voldemort has been translated to Flight from Death by many of us meaning that Tom flees from death. But it can also be translated as Death's Flight, which could mean that even death is afraid of him. Any thoughts on this?


** Voldemort is about as much French as Wingardium Leviosa is latin. Also flight from death is not a correct pseudotranslation either.

*** I know that it's pretty poor translation work, but hey, we can't do anything but interpret what is there. And this is my attempt at doing just that :)

** I much prefer this interpretation. /Death's Flight/ has a number of connotations that suit Tom Riddle more than "Flight from Death."

To me it reads as if Riddle is claiming the mantle of death itself. Especially as he is the only wizard we see flying under his own power. This ties in wonderfully with the Hallows.

He tries to use the Deathstick against the Master Of Death and understandably looses.

** First of all, "Vol " can either be translated to "Flight " or "Theft ". And considering Voldemort arrogance, I'm convinced he would rather "Steal from Death " than "Flee from it ". It's still terrible French though, the kind of translation someone who never learnt french could come up with after reading a dictionnairy for 1h.

PS : also please, the "T" is silent when you pronounce his name.

*** It is the time honored tradition of all English speaking peoples to mispronounce French without a care about it.

**** I'm French yes, and to answer your question :

In every case, you could, litterally, translate it into "Vol de Mort", but the structure sound strange so a French would probably change it every time :

​

- *Theft of Death* : Since, and I quote "Of is often used as a possessive", it could mean that "The Death" (as a concept, or an item called "The Death" was stolen. So you could translate it to *"'La Mort' volée"*. Also, if you change it just a little (Theft of deaths or deads), you could end up with "*Les morts volées*" as in someone going around and stealing bodies.

​

- *Theft from Death* : in this case, it would mean someone stole something from Death (like his life). In this case, I would probably also use *"'La Mort' volée"*Yes same translation, in this case, it's the context of these sentence (like a newspaper article following this title) that would give you the true meaning.

​

- *Flight from Death* : imagine a flight taking off from a place called "Death". A litteral translation could be "*Vol depuis La Mort*" but it doesn't sound great so the structure would probably be changed in French. Personally, in this context, I would change it into something like "*Un Avion en Enfer*" (a plane in Hell) which would give around the same meaning. But another speaker could give you another translation.

​

- *Flight of Death* : a flight where people die inside, once again horror movie context. Add a "The" at the start and you get "*Le Vol de la Mort*", I'm honnestly surprised there is no horror movie called it.Oh yeah and apparantly, with "*FlightS of death*", you get "Les vols de la mort", wich is a name given to a war practice used by some South American dictatures during the 70's and 80's. Put someone into a plane, fly toward the sea until you are really far from the coast, and throw the poor guy outside. Some body end up on the beach, most don't.

​

So that's how I would translate it, if any French speaker has anything to add or correct.

***** The only thing I would have to add is that, while "Death" (anthropogenic entity) can be translated as "La mort", (see most of Pratchett), you'll find the image "La Faucheuse" much more frequently (the reaper).\\
Also, the use of masculine and feminine in french does not help.\\
Finally, yeah, the structure is obviously not french, but of all the possible (mis)interpretation, "flee from death" is basically the last one that would come to mind for a french speaker.

*** I know how poor of a translation it is, but I'm pretty sure that she just wanted a French-ish name to play on British stereotypes. I mean, Voldemort, Malfoy, Lestrange. French name = bad guy. Also, to continue on the LeFay stuff

*** I would translate it more like "Theft of (a) death", which could make sense considering that he literally stole the life of his victims to fuel his own (even if since he made severals horcux if "/vol de mort*s*/" would have been more fitting.).

** [[/u/plusmortgage]] gives a long explanation, but basically: "Vol de mort" is grammatically incorrect in most contexts, but if we forget that, the translation "flight from death" is the last one that would come in mind for a native french speaker.
