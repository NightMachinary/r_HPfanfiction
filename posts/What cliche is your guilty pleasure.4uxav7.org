Similar to [[https://m.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4tgaj2/what_awful_cliche_is_overused_in_fics_about_your/][this]]. For me, it's mostly H/Hr Head Boy/Girl (usually 8th year) fics. Their mostly pretty bad, but sometimes you just need something cute and light-hearted.

**** They're /very/ few and far between. The one that I really remember is "HJG: The Smartest Witch of Her Age?" This is a straight-up bashing story. It's not what I would call a classic by any means. It's horrible to Hermione--without having her be tortured to insanity or whatever by Evil!Harry. It's basically a slash-and-burn response to Super!Hermione fics. I tagged it as "crack".

linkffn(5858832)

There are a few more that split her from Harry because of her unwavering loyalty to Dumbledore where she's not loyal because his actions engendered that loyalty, but because of his mythos.

And there's a slash/soul-bond/time travel re-do fic that has her being the secret grandchild of Dumbledore and he was teaching and guiding her from a young age to be Harry's friend.

There seems to be four types of Bad Hermione: 1) Can't survive in the real world Hermione; 2) Overly loyal to Bad Dumbles Hermione; 3) Dumbles' secret agent Hermione; and 4) "I'm too young to die" Hermione who separates herself from Harry because all the dangerous situations revolve around him.

Number 4 often includes, "Oh God the mistake I've made" Hermione later in the story.

  Most people tend to assume they'll wake up exactly where they fall asleep, and usually they have good reason to do so. For someone, however, even that simple certainty stops being a given one strange night, when quite surprisingly he does in fact not wake up where he fell asleep. And that is only the beginning of what will be one most unusual week in the life of Harry Potter.

** Cavity-inducing H/Hr romance. I go through a cycle of loving a story and then hating myself for (occasionally) having such awful standards, but I always go back and look for more whenever I'm between more 'praiseworthy' fics.

I know that linkffn(11388837) has no literary merit even among fanfic, but that's pretty much what I'm talking about.

  Hermione loves her books. Hermione loves her Harry. Get between Hermione and either at your own peril. Series of connected one-shots.

  Did you ever wonder what happened in the 19 years between the last chapter and the epilogue of Deathly Hallows? Or what happens afterward? Totally, completely, and eventually H/Hr, but we have a long road to get there! Rated T for language & sexuality.

** The one where McGonagall is all like, "But Harreh, your father could perform Dumbledore-to-Dildo before Ollivander ever touched his wand!"

And then Harry's all like, "Maybe I should try harder, then,"

And she replies, "Yeah, sure, whatever. Have an E-- no... the /grade/, Potter."

And all of a sudden, Harry's a Transfiguration prodigy. But I like Harry and I love Transfiguration, so it's kind of all good... Until he proceeds to never use Transfiguration in the story. Just a little salty over here.

** Lord Potter-Black-Etc & most of the tropes that go along with it. I don't know if I've ever read one that's actually well-written, but I'm trash for shitty fics, apparently.

** H/Hr with a Lord Potter-Black-(add variety of other titles)

I love to read them because during that time my brain basically shuts off. Its like watching Transformers after a marathon of good movies.
