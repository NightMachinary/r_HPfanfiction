Okay I get its pretty basic BUT I'm looking for specific ones like Seraph of the End where the sword is possessed or it gives harry cool powers. He must be able to actual use it properly instead of swinging it around like a toy. Any help is great, no slash or fem!harry please. Thanks!


** The closest I have is the sequel to The Arithmancer, where Hermione makes herself a sword using carbon nanotubes. Probably not really what you want.

There might be fics where Harry keeps hold of the Sword of Gryffindor, instead of leaving it on Dumbledore's wall? But I don't know of any offhand.

** Linkffn(The Wizard of the Kaleidoscope). A bit of a crossover with Naruto and Nasuverse, but things are pretty decently explained. Lots of emphasis on magic swords.

  What does it take to destroy something completely? Some would be fine with eradicating its soul. Others would argue that you must erase even the concept of the object from existence. AU, with a notoriously complex Magic system.
