Based on the link above, there are 12 chapters published on Fanfiction.net. But the author has posted the drafts for up to chapter 17 on the Dark Lord Potter Forums.

The link to those chapters on the Dark Lord Potter Forums is: [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/harry-potter-and-the-boy-who-lived.17021/]]

However, you have to create an account to access them there.
