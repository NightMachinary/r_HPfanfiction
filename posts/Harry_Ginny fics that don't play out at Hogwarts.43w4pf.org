I find myself reading more and more fics that don't have Hogwarts as the main setting. I'm just tired of it. No matter how hard writers try, I think Hogwarts is a bit too milked out as a main setting.

I've searched for post-hogwarts fics, but sadly, there's just way too many stories that revolve around the plot point "Harry/Ginny disappears for x amount of years, now they're strangers to each other." And I don't want that kind of story, it's just way too angsty in my opinion. I'd rather have stories where they're either happily married with a job and maybe kids, or fics where they both go to another school than Hogwarts (preferably together), or they have to flee from Hogwarts for some reason and live on the run.

Examples:

Strangers at Drakeshaugh linkffn(6331126)

Perilous Journey linkffn(8281675)

The Unbreakable Vow linkffn(3703793)

The Nameless Man linkffn(9537818)

Thanks in advance!


** EDIT: Note that some of these aren't on FanFiction.net, so the bot isn't going to see them all.

Somebody PM'd me a while back asking for something slightly similar... I'm pressed for time here so I can't go through and filter the ones of these that don't fit your specifications, but I'm pretty sure 85% of them do, so, enjoy! (I literally copy-pasted the PM, so if some of the language seems odd, it's bc I was replying):

  - If you haven't read anything from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1864945/pottermum][pottermum]], definitely take a look at her list of stories. Many of them (seriously, like, a /ton/ of them) fall into some combination of post-hogwarts; H/G never met; etc etc. She writes some really great stuff, and most of her stories tend to be a good length for passing 2-3 hours if you read rather quickly, though she does have a couple long ones which are just as good.
  - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1816754/sbmcneil][sbmcneil]] has a story called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4936039/1/Remember][Remember]] which, while not post-hogwarts, is definitely in the H/G "never met" category (as you might guess, they did technically meet, but cannot remember ;) ha). She also wrote one (for an SIYE challenge I believe!) called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10869280/1/Love-Me-Not][Love Me Not]] which fits the bill. Really, most all of her stories are great imo, and she does still update every now and again, which is awesome, so if you like her writing, don't hesitate to read her other stories, even the incomplete ones!
  - st122's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7768541/1/A-Cannon-s-Harpy][A Canon's Harpy]] is another favorite of mine, and is particularly enjoyable even if you don't care about quidditch, so don't worry about that. Also from them, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7103775/1/Summer-s-Breeze][Summer's Breeze]], which is short and sweet.
  - SarahC20's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9914577/1/A-story-of-Love][A story of Love]]...it's just in my fav list on FFN, reading the summary makes me want to re-read it, and it fits haha
  - thebackupkid's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9702836/1/The-Thing-He-Didn-t-Realise-He-Was-Looking-For][The Thing He Didn't Realise He Was Looking For]], another one that I remember and need to re-read. It's a bit grittier, which you can probably guess from the summary, but I remember it being great
  - slincoln's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10721707/1/When-You-Wasn-t-Famous][When you wasn't famous]] is another quidditch one, different from A Canon's Harpy, and not as good imo, but still worth a mention for sure
  - jojor99's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7630045/1/A-Set-Up-Gone-Wrong][A Set Up Gone Wrong]] is excellent.
  - TheLastZion's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5856625/1/The-Return-of-the-Marauders][The Return of the Marauders]], gosh what can I say about this one. It's certainly not post-hogwarts, but it is very much H/G-never-met-but-fall-hard-when-they-do territory. It's definitely a super!harry story, but I still highly recommend it even if that's not your usual cup of tea, because while it's definitely super!harry, there are so many other characters who are super! that it's not too unbalanced. Well...unless you're the bad guys that is...or some other characters haha ;) Seriously, at times you might think "is this a crack fic?", but it totally isn't, because all of the plot points do actually make sense within the story... I could honestly keep rambling, but just read it, it's an experience, not something which can be summed up lol. You won't regret it. Do it...doooo iiittt.
  - Trinka's [[http://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=3685][Reality Bites]] is super AU, which is likely quite obvious by its summary. Admittedly, it might also sound rather dull. But the ending is very rewarding, just... perhaps read this one when you have a bit more patience for /sloooow/ build.
  - DragonHeartString's [[http://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=129851][Seeing Double]]...tbh, I don't remember much about this one, but it does sound like it might fit?
  - You said you've read on SIYE, so perhaps you've seen Pilargirl's [[http://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=129299][The Commoner Queen]], since its last chapter was uploaded a couple weeks ago. If not, it's good, read it!
  - Ohhh yes, Count Westwest's [[http://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=128465][Ginny Duty]] is very very good indeed.
#+end_quote

And then I sent a followup email once I realized decided that I wanted to list out some specific pottermum stories since she has so many, so here's the exact copy of that PM as well:

#+begin_quote
  I honestly forgot /just how many/ stories pottermum has lol. Let me save you some time browsing through her page (though you still should! there are some great H/G fics she wrote that aren't on this list!):

  - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10985124/1/Daughters-of-Heroes][Daughters of Heroes]]
  - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11041352/1/Family-lost-Family-found][Family lost, Family found]]
  - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11103258/1/Healer-of-his-Heart][Healer of His Heart]]
  - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11262376/1/Serendipity][Serendipity]]
  - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11299554/1/Living-for-the-Moment][Living for the Moment]]
  - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11423633/1/Married-in-Haste][Married in Haste]]
  - Annnndd last but not least, her most recent one, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11567591/1/It-s-Complicated][It's Complicated]] (NSFW for SURE, but the back half of the story isn't as smutty as the front half. It's just a great smut-fluff story.)

*** Pottermum is a relatively new author, but she writes really well. Another of her stories I like very much is *Always*, linkffn(11379466), which is (still) epilogue compliant and quite emotional.

*** Wow, that's a lot of fanfics!

I know a couple of them already (just finished re-reading Remember), but I'm afraid you didn't quite understand my request.

I simply wanted a fic where the main setting isn't Hogwarts. And I really don't like fics where Harry or Ginny disappears for x amount of years, and then returns, and a whole heap of angst and heartbreak happens before they finally get together. So a lot of these fics are not that attractive to me. Could it be that you intended to post this on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/43sfnj/help_finding_au_hg_story/][this very similar thread from earlier yesterday]], but mixed it up a bit by accident?

I'm sorry :( you've put a lot of work into this post and here I am, telling you what isn't good about it. Still, thank you for the collection of stories. I really appreciate the work you've put into it! I always love these kinds of long comments with endless lists of fanfics.

** You forgot to mention the immediate post-DH fic that has been written a million times and reads the same every single time. Would a modicum of originality be too much to ask for?

Anyway, I've got a few recs for you:

- St Margarets's [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?action=printable&textsize=0&sid=4384&chapter=all][Magic Within, Magic Without]] is an excellently written summer romance. I absolutely adore the setting of the fic at Ginny's great aunt's house. There's a magical feel about that place, like the first time we were shown Diagon Alley and Hogwarts in the main books. My only complaint is that Ginny is slightly OOC, but this is still my favorite romance in the fandom.

- linkffn(The Children's Crusade by theelderwand1). Harry, Ginny, Ron and Hermione travel to another dimension to kill Voldemort. Sequel to linkffn(Stop All the Clocks by theelderwand1) which you have to read first.

- linkffn(Failsafe by Hannanora Potter). Post DH HP/LotR crossover.

- linkffn(Ginny Weasley and the Goblet of Fire). Ginny participates in the Tri Wizard Tournament held at Beauxbatons the year after the war.

- linkffn(Epithalamium by Northumbrian). One of the very few pure fluff fics I like.

- linkao3(your losses or your arrears by irnan). Ginny tries her hand at investigative journalism. There are other fics in this series that are pretty good too.

- [[http://pocketfullof.livejournal.com/229285.html][The Grown Up Driver]] and [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1181280][Compromise: A Love Story]] are two of the best canon-compliant post war oneshots that exist.

- linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent) is my favorite fic in the fandom (one of the two anyway), but it is partly set at Hogwarts and romance is far from the main aspect of the story. Most of the story is outside of Hogwarts though, and it has some of the best characterizations ever.

*** Yeah, I'm a bit tired of the immediate post-DH stories as well. You can only read so many of them before they become boring.

But thanks a lot for all these suggestions! I'm going to sift through them later, it looks like there's some pretty good ones in there!

  If this were a detective story, Ginny would write it up with the title "The Adventure of the Quidditch Player".Harry says that's a stupidly generic title for a detective story but, as Ginny has long been at pains to explain to their son, Harry's not known for his literary criticism. Other things, sure. But not that.
