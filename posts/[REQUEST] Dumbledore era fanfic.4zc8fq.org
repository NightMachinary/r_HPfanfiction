I've realized I've read SO few Dumbledore-in-school fics. It would be really interesting! I'm also hoping for some involvement of Grindelwald, so I'm completely open to slash and romance. Hoping it's complete or long (100k+ words)! Any suggestions?


** Not Dumbledore centric, but both Dumbledore and Grindelwald play major roles in this story: linkffn(Altered Destinies by DobbyElfLord)

  Post DH. When Dumbledore gives Harry a choice between life & death in King's Cross station, he chooses a third option. Now Harry faces stopping two wars before they even happen, because he can't accept what is in store for the world. HarryAriana.

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

** Not a fic but [[http://nicholaskole.deviantart.com/art/Harry-Potter-1945-63015594][this little comic]] imo nails the tone of their confrontation in 1945.

I know a bunch of post-school fics, but this is the only Hogwarts one I know. It's not particularly great, but still a fine read. Neither complete nor long, but it updates every now and then.

  It's 1898 and Hogwarts, against all better judgement, is hosting the Triwizard Tournament. Albus is surprised when he meets a Durmstrang student who may not be on par with him in talent, but makes up for it in cleverness, charm, and spirit. Maybe he's met his rival, or maybe - just maybe - he's met his match. / AD x GG / WIP
