Lily Evans - Arctic fox

Severus Snape - Firefly

Regulus Black - Gray fox

Barty Crouch jr - Barn swallow

Pandora Wilde/Lovegood - Old world swallowtail butterfly

Add suggestions, please


** Honestly, I would probably imagined Regulus's patronus to be butterflies.

** This might be a stupid question but wouldn't a gray fox and an arctic fox look the same while in patronus form ? Being translucent, eerie and ghostly ?

** I always have Regulus as a lynx, but fox definitely works. the fact that they sort of match is cute

I generally only see the two of them in a triad with James, so I'm interested to see what vibe you have with them as a pairing. I'll for sure be reading it when you post ðŸ¥°

*** i feel in a world where snape had a more healthy relationship with lily he would be less inclined to be the person he grew up to be

** How are Patronuses determined in your story?

Is it a symbol of the character's personality, a symbol of something they trust to protect them, a symbol of happiness, a symbol of something that makes them happy, random animals that you think are cool, animal instinct/symbology that has some link to the character, etc?

**** Okay then, so I guess their appropriateness would depend on what types of symbology you're seeing in them. Modern animal symbolism is kind of a mix and adaptation of an entire world of esoteric traditions and beliefs, so it's a little difficult to examine that specifically without knowing what you're thinking. What's your logic to attach each Patronus to each character?

Like, Foxes generally represent wisdom and cunning and immediate need for action in troubled times; Arctic Foxes can represent purity, or magic within mundanity, or even stubbornness and a need to persist through troubled times; Gray Foxes can represent conservatism (as in the sentiment, not the political alignment), harmony and balance, or difficulty distinguishing between truth and fiction, or even just nobility. There's a big range of symbology attached to each animal depending on what part of the world you look at them in.
