Fanon often has rituals as being either illegal for some reason or another, but a thought occurred to me to subvert that trope...

Rituals are /technically/ still legal... it's just that even the most basic of them (such as correcting eyesight) have a high chance of spectacularly backfiring and /literally/ exploding: glasses would be preferable to having the ritual go wrong and your blood boiling in your veins before you messily implode, or something. Even when they are successful, the degree of success varies greatly to the point where all that danger may have been worthless for the result.

The general view is that if you're stupidly lucky to survive, more power to you that you, ya know, didn't die /horribly/.

Enter Harry, who has a unnatural knack for not only pulling off rituals, but also having a near enough 99% success rate of achieving the intended goals or even /surpassing/ them.

His ability quickly leaks out, and soon he's approached from fellow students (even some of the Slytherins, whose transparent ploys of being nice are obvious), the teachers (which surprises some of the muggle-raised), and even adults to work on a freelance basis.

However, Harry quickly comes to realize that he has to weed out those whom are friends and those whom are just trying to use him.


** I would certainly read such a fic, and I'd be probably willing to forgive many tropes and cliches that normally result in me closing the tab.

** Or better yet Draco makes a quip about Harry doing the rituals got free. Harry then enlists Hermione to do the books side of things. They forge a mighty company. Eventually getting an office and a work shop. They take pitty on Ron who becomes the janitor.
