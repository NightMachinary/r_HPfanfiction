** The Debt of Time is an absolute classic. It's a Time Travel AU with the pairing Sirius/Hermione.

#+begin_quote
  When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner.

** Romance with Sirius or just Romance in general? Might help to clarify a little in your description. Either way, these are both good Sirius fics.

Self insert, but cursed to prevent her from saying/changing anything. Romance. Fade to black sex scenes.

I don't ship Sirius/Remus, but most fanfics centering around Sirius are wolfstar. Here are a few well written enough for me to enjoy the fic despite the ship:

Long fic. I'm usually not into fluffy teen romances or no magical au, but this is just super cute and funny.

One shot. Again, I don't ship wolfstar but this is really adorable and well written.
