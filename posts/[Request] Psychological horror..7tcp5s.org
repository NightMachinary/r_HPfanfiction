Characters gone mad from The Revelation; things that man was not meant to know; ancient grimoires that make even Voldemort hesitate.

Or maybe something more mundane? The muggles are not as scary as some purebloods may think.

/They are scarier/.

I've been having some great nights of full sleep lately. Dare you try to change that?

Edit: Wouldn't it be nice if the bot worked though?

  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.

*** Anything but Slytherin fucked me up *badly* when I first read it. I really want to see that world explored.

"...the quiet ones" was good. Nothing special though, just... good.

Haven't read your other suggestions. I'll check them out, thanks!

** linkffn(7713063) and linkffn(2452681) are probably the 'classic' recommendations, if you haven't read them yet.

I remember linkffn(9172846) to have an interesting start, but it's been abandoned before it could get too far. linkao3(1117301) might qualify.

  The Tale of Three Brothers was not a legend. It was a warning. No one cheats Death. And luckily for Lily Potter, the promise of the Cloak's return in exchange for her son's life was a fair deal. Stare into the abyss, Harry Potter, and we will see who blinks first.
