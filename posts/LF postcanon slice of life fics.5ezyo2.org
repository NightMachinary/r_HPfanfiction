(not including CC, or optionally, the epilogue of the 7th book)

I read the series by G Norman Lippert and several other fics, and it left me wanting a fic where the younger generation doesn't face any yearly life threatening situations, and have a relatively normal school life.

Or it could be focused on the original cast, but the same applies, no world ending threats.
