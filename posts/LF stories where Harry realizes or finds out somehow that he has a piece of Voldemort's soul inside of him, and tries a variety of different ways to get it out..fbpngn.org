Can be on any site, am fine with het/slash/femslash, anyone can be the main character.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not, that's fine too.

Would rather have very little to no character bashing. Characters disliking or hating on each other is fine, but authors going out of their way to bash a character is normally a no go.

Would rather not have Harem or Lord Harry stories either.

Harry slightly powerful or slightly smarter than in canon is fine, but would rather be as believable as possible.


** In linkffn(7505602), Harry finds out about the horcrux and becomes suicidal and Dumbledore tries hard to persuade him not to kill himself till he finds an alternative. Sadly, it is abandoned after 26 chapters.

*** Dang, that's unfortunate that it's abandoned, I hate starting stories that weren't finished... but it seems interesting, I'll try it out. Thanks!

  AU When Harry is fighting Voldemort for the Philosopher's Stone, he makes the horrible discovery that he is keeping Voldemort alive by hosting a fraction of his soul. What is the rest of Harry's time at Hogwarts like when he knows that he has to die?

** Heh. I imagine this escalating very, very quickly as more and more people get involved (and Harry gets more desperate). An endless litany of helpful suggestions and old wives' tales and Harry tries everything. Twenty chapters in, he decides to breed Basilisks with Hagrid in order to harvest the venom.
