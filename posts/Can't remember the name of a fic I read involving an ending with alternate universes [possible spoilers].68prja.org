A year or so ago I read a fic that was similar to HPMOR that introduced a new character who in the end turned out to be some sort of alien/demigod type who helped harry travel to alternate dimensions and defeat Voldemort, but I can't remember the name of it. Anybody else familiar and can help me remember?


** linkffn(Dimension hopping for beginners by nonjon) might be it. Not sure.

  COMPLETE. In the heat of the battle, he swore a blood oath to defeat Voldemort in every form. But when you factor in his understanding and abilities to travel to alternate dimensions, it presented the sort of problem only a Harry Potter could have.
