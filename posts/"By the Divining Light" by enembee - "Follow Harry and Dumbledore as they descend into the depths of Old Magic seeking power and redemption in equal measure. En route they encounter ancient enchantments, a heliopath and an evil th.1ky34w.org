*** A few mentor Dumbledore stories come to mind (though they are different from this one):

Sib's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1709027/1/The-Awakening-Power][The Awakening Power]] is a replacement for year 6 that has a powerful Harry coming into his own under Dumbledore's mentoring. Features one of the best competitive duels between the two. 250k words, complete.

  Complete! Challenges fill Harry's 6th year: growing powers, Snape as defense teacher, new Potions teacher, a new crush on him, Voldemort, Ginny, Goblins? Lots of humor, drama, action and romance! H:G,R:Hr. Award winner!

jbern's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8712160/1/The-Next-Lord-of-Kobol][The Next Lord of Kobol]] has as a divergence point Dumbledore's taking Harry with him when confronted in his office by the Aurors in OOtP.

  Carried to the far end of the Galaxy by the veil in the Department of Mysteries, Harry Potter becomes a veritable stranger in a strange land.
