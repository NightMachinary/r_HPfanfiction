I find it exceptionally bizarre that there isn't much out there for the MÃ©nage a trio, despite it being the most obvious threeway choice out of the lot. I don't care if it's pointless smut or unnecessarily long, can I get some please?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8222091/16/The-random-craziness-file][A one-shot chapter in Random Craziness File]] by [[/u/darklooshkin]] is a Dark!Trio fic where they have that sort of a dynamic.

*** It was also meant as a serious intro... until I figured out that I would have had to start at the very beginning to make it work.

I also realised that convincingly writing 11-year-olds with superpowers being thrust into an alien world that has more in common with Mogadishu than with London is really, really hard for me.

So this is sadly staying a one-shot for now, if only because starting at the very start of philosopher's stone would be... difficult.

Isn't that basically the plot of the first half of The Snow Queen?

***** They're sixteen. Less angst, more 'oh look, hostiles! Let's kill 'em all!'

Five years' worth of near-death experiences in alien environs (the underground sections of Hogwarts are /huge/ thanks to the distinctly non-Euclidean architecture born from the mind of a magical castle that has more in common with Shodan than anything else), hostile peers, negligent teachers and prefects spending more time actively ignoring the bad stuff so they can survive until graduation means that she's vastly more direct and aggressive than she'd been at eleven.

And Rose is a traumatized and abused girl that found her calling in performing acts of mass murder in the name of making her grandfather happy.

Neither of those are actually hard to write. Motivation + goal = action. The consequences of the things they do is harder to write than establishing the rationale behind them doing said things.

  Eventually, they find a note tacked to the gargoyle who guards the passage to the Headmaster's office. It is in Granger's handwriting and signed by her at the bottom, and tells them that, the danger being over and the initial aftermath winding down, she feels that the three of them need some time alone to recuperate and will reappear exactly three days from that day, at four o'clock.

  #+begin_example
      presumes a very slight altering of canon so that the scene with the locket\-Horcrux and inside the Room of Requirement at the end point towards a triad, rather than the canon 'ship\.

** Besides the mentioned, try scouring livejournal. From what I've seen lots of trio writers would amass there.

And maybe hit up [[/u/SilverCookieDust]]. They have some.

*** It should be noted that I don't know exactly /what/ I have. I just archived a ton of stuff from The Quidditch Pitch, which apparantly had a lot of trio fics. I can probably help with specific fic searches, but not general recs.

(One day I might make a list of what fics I have, but it's a lot so it would take a while.)

****** Every single fic from the TQP archive or just the trio ones? There was a few stories I enjoyed that were not hosted anywhere else.

Can you pass me the tag for those.
