Walked out of the cinema wanting to read Leta/Tina stories, didn't find many. But I did find this cute Leta/Tina/Newt story. linkao3(16728825) And I want more cute poly stories like this. As long as there is no Snape, dumbledore, Voldemort in the pairing, I'm fine with whatever pairing in either Harry Potter or Fantastic Beasts. Length over 10k would be lovely, but I doubt I'll get any. Some smut would be fine.

Thank you!


** This immediately post-war fic is a little meandering, but it's a very good main trio finding their footing both as a couple and as people free from the war. linkao3(137248)

This main trio fic is mostly explicit, nerfs the Harry/Ginny relationship in a gentle way, and has really, really good characterization that's relatively true to the books. The coming together of the triad is pretty believable, too. linkao3(8634751)

Sorry they're both the main trio--I've read others but don't have the time to dig them out at the moment. If there aren't more recs when I get back from work, I'll add some more.

  Eventually, they find a note tacked to the gargoyle who guards the passage to the Headmaster's office. It is in Granger's handwriting and signed by her at the bottom, and tells them that, the danger being over and the initial aftermath winding down, she feels that the three of them need some time alone to recuperate and will reappear exactly three days from that day, at four o'clock.

  Harry, Ron and Hermione missed out on having any sexual experiences in school because of their adventures on their quest to stop Voldemort. Now that the war is over, Hermione decides its time to change that. And she has books!

  Ever since Percival came back, it's been... different. Distant. His colleagues respect his boundaries so well, and the only trouble is he doesn't remember making them. He thinks, sometimes, that it's more for their benefit than his. He doesn't even know what he was hoping for. Closeness maybe, or affection. Trust.\\
  He listens to the sounds of Newt and Tina on the other side of the door, and their intimacy burns right through him. He tips his head back, trying to tell himself it's enough, trying not to let it cut him to the bone.

**** Yes, but the first iteration of it is more poly than harem (Susan and Daphne and Harry) It takes a long time for them to integrate someone else into their group.

  Words have more power than we think. Thoughts & dreams can be revealed to those closest to us, to those we want to know more of, & to our greatest enemies. A single act of kindness, a single word can change someone's entire world. Join Harry on another adventure through his time at Hogwarts where even the quietest whispers can make a difference. Harry/Multi. Mature for a reason.
