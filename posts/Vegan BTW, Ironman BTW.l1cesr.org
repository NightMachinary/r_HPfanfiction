What would be the wizarding worlds version of being a vegan or a runescape ironnan. Where you always find out about it 2 seconds aftermeeting them and its always brought up too show their moral superiority? 'Hi, I'm Hanna Abbott, how are you? Would sounds lovely, I'm great thanks, why? Well because I'm a -Insertwizardingvegan- and that makes me just feel amazing.

If you want to get cracky, I like the idea of animagi acting like that. "Hello, have I mentioned that I can turn into a zebra?"
