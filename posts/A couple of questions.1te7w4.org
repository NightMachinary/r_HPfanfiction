I recently started getting into fanfiction, the more I looked for fics that would interest me, the more I found things I simply did not understand.

With questions blazing wildely in my mind I left fanfiction.net and fled to reddit, where I hoped to find answers to my questions. I found this lovely subreddit here and thought that this was the perfect place to find anwers for the previously mentioned questions.

Here they are:

1. Why is Nightmares of Futures Past the most favorited fic on fanfiction.net? I find it boring and revatively uneventful, even though it features themes I usually love such as time travel, powerful Harry and Harry/Ginny.

2. What's up with the Draco love? He was douche with no redeming qualities in the books.

3. Why do people hate on Ginny? In my opinion she is the perfect girl for Harry.

4. Who is Daphne Greengrass? I found alot of Harry/Daphne fics, was there ever even any interaction with her in the novels?

5. Why do people bash? Sure I understand disliking a character, but taking a characters flaws and magnifying them just takes away from the story.

And finally although this isn't acutally a question, I would really appericiate it if someone could reccomended me some good fics featuring H/G. It doesn't have to be the primary theme of the fic but I get annoyed at pretty much every other pairing except for Harry/Hermione.

Thanks for the help!

It's impossible to understand why a work from 2005 (before all the books even came out) was considered groundbreaking at the time. What you need to realize is that all the things that are boring/tame/predictable/cliche/... NOW, weren't back in the day. Back then they were actually new and original.

Just like how Lord of the Rings wasn't a cookie-cutter fantasy when it came out. Tolkien actually invented the idea of bow-wielding elves and dwarves with big beards and axes, but nowadays the very idea seems boring and cliche.

To answer your other questions:

#+begin_quote
  What's up with the Draco love? He was douche with no redeeming qualities in the books.
#+end_quote

I honestly don't know why people try to redeem that scumbag. I don't get Snape either for that matter.

#+begin_quote
  Why do people hate on Ginny? In my opinion she is the perfect girl for Harry.
#+end_quote

This has two reasons:

A) Ginny was introduced to us as a fangirl who liked "the-boy-who-lived" and is therefore not suitable to be with "the real Harry".

B) Because Hermione exists, and her marriage with Ron instead of Harry is an even bigger mystery. Most fics that hate on Ginny only do so when Hermione ends up with Harry.

#+begin_quote
  Who is Daphne Greengrass?
#+end_quote

She is a Slytherin girl from Harry's year.

Since she appears in the books, she is canon and thus free to use.

Since she has no lines of herself, she is a blank slate to fill in however the writer wants to.

Unlike other characters like Millicent Bullstrode, she was never explicitly described as bigoted or ugly. thus you are free to turn her into "Hogwarts' most beautiful girl" and many fics do just that.

Thus she is the perfect OC-stand in: She can fill in any role at all your story needs without really introducing non-canon characters to Hogwarts

Because fanfiction, by definition, is written by fans and not by professional writers. Many fans write with their feelings and not with their brain. If they don't like a character they feel the need to bash him/her, even if it makes no sense at all for the plot.

Both characters got /rediculously/ attractive actors in the movies. This also partly answers why people love Hermione/anyone. The actors Tom Felton, Alan Rickman, and Emma Watson were (or turned into) simply beautiful people who oozed charisma on the screen.

Don't get me wrong, Daniel Radcliffe is now widely considered to be a hunk, but it doesn't really come together unless he takes his shirt (or more...) off. But he can't hold a candle to the presence of those other three in the movies.

Most human beings want beautiful people to be good because they are beautiful. And because they are beautiful, they have to be secretly good. Even if they are very, very bad people (Draco and Snape).

A lesser form is also that, though Hermione was annoying in a way most immature little boys consider like nails on a chalkboard for pretty much of the time in the books (though she was usually right from a mature viewpoint), lots of people still ship her with Harry *strongly*, usually for no good reason. Nag, nag, homework is fun, not everyone you dislike is evil, lol sports, universal rights, nag. Maybe not the most attractive attributes for a young woman, especially for two of the school's dumb jocks (which Harry and Ron /clearly/ were).

But the actress Emma Watson grew into a near-supermodel by the last two movies. So obviously the character Hermione isn't really /that/ annoying after all, and the hero should get the "best" girl in the story, thus Harry/Hermione. So while Bonnie Wright turned out cute enough, she's no Emma Watson, that's for sure. And she's /also/ a jock, while Hermione is a nerd. Guess who nerds ship with Harry?

Beauty is goodness, hero gets the "good" geeky girl, movie feels trump book realities. At least, that's one way to look at it. Does that make sense?

#+end_quote

I only made it halfway through myself... I think it was extremely popular while being written, and a lot of the favorites came from that time period. Rather like a TV show, fics can be great in episodes and kind of crappy all together at once.

#+begin_quote

  1. What's up with the Draco love? He was douche with no redeming qualities in the books.

Tom Felton (actor in the movies) was sexy. Also, the "good girls like bad guys" thing. I don't read Draco fics.

#+begin_quote

  1. Why do people hate on Ginny? In my opinion she is the perfect girl for Harry.
#+end_quote

Weasley-bashing is popular in general. The idea with Ginny is supposed to be that she was a Harry Potter fangirl slut, and this undeserving of the "real Harry".

#+begin_quote

  1. Who is Daphne Greengrass? I found alot of Harry/Daphne fics, was there ever even any interaction with her in the novels?
#+end_quote

Nope not really. She's a Slytherin in Harry's year; her little sister Astoria marries Draco in canon. This is the female version of the Draco phenomenon in some fics, in others she's the misunderstood daughter of an upright Pureblood family who's actually OK with Muggleborns and hates the Dark Lord. IDK.

I agree. Except manipulative!Dumbledore, I love that shit!!

Harry Potter and the Seventh Horcrux is an alternative Deathly Hallows and my favorite H/G. H/Hr is my favorite though, so... That's all I have. I recommend using the filters when you search (don't check "pairing", that's a new feature and older fics don't have it enabled). My basic search is 100k+ words, Complete, English, any rating, WITHOUT Draco Malfoy or Severus Snape

You're projecting fanon onto several of the characters.

Bill and Charlie don't have enough screen time to evince their flaws.

Ron is far from stupid. He plays a mean game of chess, passes all his Hogwarts classes without effort, and is quick on his feet. Canon also indicates that Hermione was able to teach him to play Für Elise on the piano in just a few days. (I don't know about you, but as a pianist I can say it took me years of practice to get to where I could play that.) More accurate would be to say he's undisciplined.

Canon Ginny is /not/ slutty. She is shown to have dated three guys in three years, attending a single date (the Yule Ball) with a fourth. This is hardly evidence of the sort of legendary promiscuity that the fanon attaches to her.

Arthur may be a gentle soul who is deferential to his wife, but he is no pushover. He stands up for what he believes in throughout the series. He joined the Order, fought in the Battle of the Seven Potters and the Battle of Hogwarts. He personally informed Harry of Sirius being after him. He got into a fistfight in public with Lucius Malfoy defending his family's honor. And he stayed in the Ministry in book 7 and publicly stood up for and advocated for Muggleborn. The guy had a core of strength to him and was sorted into Gryffindor for a reason.

I agree that Molly is controlling and Percy is overly self-absorbed. Yet both acquitted themselves in the Battle of Hogwarts. While they deserve some of their fanon caricatures, they were not without merit.

****** Canon!Ginny is not a slut, but a Mary-Sue. She acquired a personality transplant in OotP and that, coupled with Rowling's godawful portrayal of romance between teenagers, makes her understandably unpopular.

I mean, really, it would be one thing if JKR had shown us some proper character growth, but this was the girl who was so insignificant that she had to accept Neville Longbottom's invitation to the Yule Ball because no one else would invite her, who seemed to have no actual friends and had to sit with Neville alone in a train compartment, and could barely talk to Harry without blushing and all of a sudden, she's this awesome Quidditch star, who's so popular that even Slytherin boys want her, who can cast a Hex that's so overpowered that it makes an elitist pureblood professor take note of her.

Is it surprising that anyone would find Ginny obnoxious?

Someone also pointed out that, in all of Ginny's interactions with Harry, she seems to be vastly more interested in the Boy-Who-lived than Harry Potter himself. If you were to replace all of her post-CoS interactions with Harry with Neville as the Boy-Who-Lived, there really wouldn't be very much difference.

******* Well this is an interesting take on the subject. In my opion Ginny is perfect for Harry. She has a similiar sense of humor and can make him laugh with out much effort, Harry obviously needs some laughter after the life he has lived. She shares the same interests as him. She isn't quick to tears, Harry has shown after his relationship with Cho that he isn't comfortable with crying. She is pretty much the only one who can also stand up to his fierce temper. She also understands him, she was able to make the hard descion to let Harry leave her for her own safety, which fundamentaly goes against her personality, this was only possible because of how much she loved and understood him. Finally she gave him a normal life, she gave him his greatest dream and the hope of a continuation of that life after his quest was finished.

Now that stuff about her being a Mary-Sue and her getting a personality transplant. Post-CoS we didn't really get any interaction with Ginny, we also later learn that she took advice from Hermione and started dating other boys in order to stop being so shy around Harry, that leads me to the assumption that she avoided interaction with Harry as much as possible till OotP when she felt comfortable around him. If she avoided interaction with Harry then that means that we never really get to see her true self, however we often heard from her brothers about her fierce temper and power of will we even get evidence of it when she stands up to Draco the first time she meets him. So her personality didn't really transform and she didn't magically become comfortable around Harry after one summer, because in the few interactions we had with her we saw evidence that she gradualy became more comfortable around him.

The thing about her magic power isn't really that surprising seeing as she is a seventh child and the person who broke the Weasley curse.

If we replaced Neville with Harry as the Boy-Who-Lived, they would still be entirely different characters. Neville might be more assertive but he wouldn't become Harry just because he was the Boy-Who-Lived so all those interactions would be different.

******** While she may be the perfect girl for cannon Harry (which I don't personally agree with but can understand the opinion), I think most fanfics change the character of Harry dramatically.

I personally can't stand Harry/Ginny pairings, not really sure why that is. I think it is just that I have read too many ginny bashing fics. At this point I have read more fanfic stories than the original books, and thus my perceptions of the characters have moved beyond how they are presented in the books. In part it is a self-perpetuating cycle, as the more I read fics that bash ginny the more I dislike her, and the more I don't enjoy fics that place ginny as a pivotal positive character.

#+end_quote

Well, "passes" isn't exactly honours, especially for the weakest electives. He also /failed/ his Divination and History of Magic O.W.L.s, so that isn't even true. And he /always/ whines about anything class related. I think that is very poor support for the idea he's some supermind.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Not that hard for the first dozen measures, which is really more likely. Pros don't "learn" pieces that fast, but any kid who's been forced into lessons before could get the easy beginning movements of that selection. Playing the piano isn't rocket science.

#+begin_quote
  Canon Ginny is not slutty. She is shown to have dated three guys in three years, attending a single date (the Yule Ball) with a fourth.
#+end_quote

Which is close to infinity more dating than any main characters until book six. Going to the ball isn't the same as dating steady, especially for our main three. Ginny also has a really bad canon case of PDA, which is usually a "sign" or code in certain types of YA literature in the United States for a shameful young woman. Which is messed up, but that's why it is popular fanon.

The thing is, the books don't exactly disprove the idea, either. And in many, many cases, people with that sort of, shall we say /breadth of experience/ would, in fact, be called sluts by their peers. So having a 14 year old call Ginny one in a fanfic isn't absurd. Having her sleeping around, however, is clearly silly. Though I don't know how anyone of either gender could have gone all Seventh (her Sixth) year hanging around AdorableHunk!Matthew Lewis in the /Come/ and /Go/ room (cough) and not tried /something/...

#+begin_quote
  Arthur may be a gentle soul who is deferential to his wife, but he is no pushover.
#+end_quote

The biggest moments for him are bumbling around Muggle stuff, sorta losing a fistfight, and almost getting ganked by a snake, then ending up in a hospital bed for everyone to crowd around being sad. Nothing against him, but not super strong warrior moments either. I think, given Percy's complaints about him, it is understandable.

And Sorting is not admissible evidence, otherwise it would be used in court trials. Also, see Wormtail.

Using the final battle in the worst book in the series to redeem people doesn't really work for me. It smacks of trying to cram in characterization in a very weak and manipulative way.

It also seems like you're simply defending the characters you like more, like Ginny and Ron, and ignoring the bad things that are sometimes the most clearly expressed attributes of characters in the books.

If a fifth of the time you hear about Ginny in the later books is about who she's kissing, that colors things. If Ron is always groaning about classes and ducking the harder electives, while also a total sports head, then yeah. People will draw conclusions.

When people write fanfiction, they often draw out things that were lesser attributes and expand on them. I think that explains the "why" of those fanon tropes. That does /not/ excuse blind, stupid, ranging bashing, but it does go towards explaining it.

In bashing fics these characters are made more abhorrent than Malfoy or Snape, which I find just silly.

** - 1. Why is Nightmares of Futures Past the most favorited fic on fanfiction.net? I find it boring and revatively uneventful, even though it features themes I usually love such as time travel, powerful Harry and Harry/Ginny.

First off, it's not the most favorited fic. That honor belongs to the equally polarizing Methods of Rationality of LessWrong.

NoFP was, for its time, a remarkable story that established or popularized many of the fanfiction tropes that make it seem tired today--battle weary Harry, magical cores, the time-travel fix-fic, etc. It hasn't aged well, partly because Matthew hasn't had much time for writing. (He wrote NoFP and his Naruto story during a longish stint of unemployment.)

- 2. What's up with the Draco love? He was douche with no redeming qualities in the books.

Much of the Draco love comes from people finding his film character physically attractive. This is also the origin of a lot of the Snape love (though he's one of the more interesting characters in canon, which also contributes).

- 3. Why do people hate on Ginny? In my opinion she is the perfect girl for Harry.

Much of the Ginny hate had a crescendo after the disappointing sixth book, where, after a long wait, we suddenly we got "monster in the chest" instead of a realistic romance. And then we got the epilogue in book 7, which also turned people off. Compounding this is that much of fanfiction at the time went way overboard with the "Ginny Sue" character archtype, i.e., Ginny as "Mary Sue" so utterly perfect and beautiful and talented. (SSHENRY's stories come to mind as among the most egregious.) This turned a lot of people off the pairing and for a long time, Ginny-hate was strong on sites like DarkLordPotter and Portkey.

- 4. Who is Daphne Greengrass? I found alot of Harry/Daphne fics, was there ever even any interaction with her in the novels?

Essentially none. She and Tracy Davis are "generic Slytherin female" types with whom Harry and company had little interaction. Jeconais established her "ice queen" stereotype and the trope took off. Incidentally, before Daphne was a thing, the "generic Slytherin" role was played most by Blaise Zabini, before it was established in canon that Blaise was male.

- 5. Why do people bash? Sure I understand disliking a character, but taking a characters flaws and magnifying them just takes away from the story.

Lazy writing, for the most part. Painting the Weasleys as gold-digging scum enabled by an evil, manipulative Dumbledore was a fad for awhile and it still has an audience from what I can tell.

As for quality Harry/Ginny pieces, I'd recommend Jeconais's This Means War (found on fanficauthors.net), anything by Deadwoodpecker (particularly [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backward with Purpose]]), Perspicacity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4889913/1/Hallows-and-Pathos][Hallows and Pathos]] (listed as Harry and Hermione, but they aren't romantically paired), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/557425/joe6991][Joe6991]]'s Hero trilogy, sib-ff's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1709027/1/The-Awakening-Power][The Awakening Power]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/457505/Melindaleo][Melindaleo]]'s collected work, and that of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]].

** Draco's character has a very interesting premise. Raised by a ruthless politician to exacting standards, well-connected, capable of providing an alternate perspective on the wizarding war and a representative of pureblood culture.

It's a pity that Canon!Draco was such a cardboard cut-out in the books. You could probably have swapped his name out for Cormac McLaggen or Zacharias Smith or literally any other obnoxious character in the books and it would have made no difference as long as they could sneer and mock Ron for being poor. Canon!Draco was a mockery of a character who was utterly devoid of personality and existed only to make Harry miserable, which is such a complete /waste/. I do agree that he gets whitewashed far too often, but to leave him as he was portrayed in the books is way too unsatisfying.

**** As someone who reads a fair amount of fics featuring Draco, it's far more interesting to start with canon Draco as a base to build from. Gerenoir was totally right in calling him a cardboard cutout. Even so, there were moments in canon that definitely showed him as more than an irredeemable Death Eater in training. He refused to identify Harry when they were caught. He was unable to go through with killing Dumbledore.

He was also just a kid throughout most of the books, a kid raised by Lucius Malfoy. I like post-Hogwarts and AU fics, so it leaves a lot of room for character development.
