The common cliches in hp fanfics

Harry suddenly gets betrayed by his friends and housemate (Notably most of the time happening in gof and a few of the times on dh or cos ) his personality changes onto some 25-year-old dude in a teen body. Also some boring love story with Daphne or susan (Rare case Ginny or pansy)

Ron and Hermione as usually portrayed as an asshole duo so do the entire Weasley family (Minus Arthur and the twins with Charlie and Bill and ginny if it is hinny fic ). Goblins becoming his greatest ally revealing he has trillions of money and things like potter manor in the wizarding world (A wizarding version of jeff Bezos right here pals )

Oh somehow he is connected with blacks due to Charlus and dorea as his grandparents (Which is debunked badly by the author herself and Charlus is also not listed on Pottermore in the Potter family treeline but fanfic writers unlimited fanfic plot point is based on it ) he becomes lord black and lord potter with some rings. Alice Longbottom is his godmother and Lily's bff (Where canon never establishes they were familiar or was in the same batch and same house with Marauders and to think if Alice was her godmother and grand Longbottom let the kid go away to the awful Dursleys and here comes dark lord Dumbledore) Dumbledore is a manipulative bastard who was responsible for all misery and events in Harry's life to train him as a weapon to destroy voldie. Goblin traces Horcrux in him they team up to destroy the Horcrux and in a few months Horcrux and voldie both get killed by a superpower magical mutant Harry Potter (To think goblin is friendly to Harry where in canon goblins are asshole to all wizards ). Also, he becomes some top level guy like the head of wizgenmont and going too far to become a mom or headmaster of Hogwarts also only at the age of 14 or 15. Our 14 or 15 years old harry is a disguised 25-year-old Frank Underwood (Even his political tactics will make him shame ) In the end, harry gets the girl who lives a super-rich life and control's the entire wizarding society of Britain .Pettigrew, dumby, Molly, Ron, etc lives Azkaban for the rest of the life, and Hermione gets kicked out by the wizarding world for messing with lord hardian black potter peviral gaunt bullshit. Harry somehow destroys the entire Malfoy family with his magical powers ,lordship power making them bankrupt and ends the marriage of mama and papa Malfoy and making Draco his house-elf.

Luna Neville Weasley twins and Dobby is portrayed as a nice guy's who is on Harry's side as his new comrades. In the end, every time Neville and luna get married (Dh part 2 results lol ).

Amelia bones is actually the biggest ally of Harry here and his greatest friend (In canon she is just another ministry person for Harry)

Draco either is a super nice guy with other 2 malfoys and daddy malfoy is Harry's mentor or they are way more asshole than canon (Depends on the ship).

Canon Harry needs to bitchslap this lord hardian black potter peverial gaunt Slytherin Ravenclaw Gryffindor asshole.


** I've never read a lord black where he is it because of his grandparents ðŸ¤” it was always because of sirius

*** The ones I've read usually have him inherit the lordship through Sirius but the only reason he CAN inherit it is because of Dorea Potter being a Black by birth.

Which usually becomes a vehicle for the author to make funny ha ha's about the Black family motto and talk about how backwards blood purity is and insert jokes about Harry being a Half-Blooded Lord Black. Just before he disowns bellatrix and brings andromeda back in... but oh wait... DUN DUN DUN Narcissa isn't evil and Draco is misguided and Lucius is abusive and AHHHHH

I've read this story so many times it isn't even funny anymore lmao

I got off track....

** I really don't like the idea of "The most ancient and noble house of Potter" it just doesn't feel right to me.

I don't have any problem with the Potters being an old family I just think that it would be cool for the Potters to be neither Noble and activity refuse to be called ancient because they have political power in other ways like owning the ground Hogwarts is built on or something like that perhaps the Potter were thieves in ancient times and got their Prominence due to that or some other shenanigans.

If you don't want the Potters to be an old family but still have relevance, the Grindelwald War could be used as a springboard. Maybe they were instrumental in their downfall or the Potters had an exceptional generation of Wizards at that time.

There are so many options but no "The Most Fabulously Ancient and Super Noble House of Potter" gets used in 70% of scenarios where Harry needs Political influence.

+I don't like goblins in general so I always have to suffer through Gringotts scenes I have dropped more than 5 fics because of Gringotts and ill bet there are going to be more.
