#+TITLE: Harry gets easily angried when someone wastes food. It starts out funny at first with "Please finish that chicken Ron," or a "I'll hex you if you burn your tart Seamus!" Then it gets serious like Draco throwing away an apple he only bite once or Umbridge not even eating those biscuits once.

**** Harry's scar started hurting like hell again. This time, he was crucioing Lucius and Rookwood for spilling their dinner. Harry was so full of anger from it he just straight up forced the plate, the glass cup, and all of the cutlery down their throats. He revelled in their screams of agony, and after they were done, he also forced them to eat the food on the floor. Afterwards, he kept crucioing them. Screams rocked the safe house. Harry woke up with a jolt, and he made sure to send Hedwig over with a card that said ‘Great work Voldy! The vision was very entertaining. That should teach them why they shouldn't waste food.' Tom cackled when he got the card and kept on torturing the two condemned. Note: Idk it was fun

** “Oi! Malfoy!” Draco braces himself with a slow, deep, breath, carefully placing a smirk on his face. Though it was odd that Potter would go for him right outside the Great Hall.

“Oh Potter,” Draco sneered straightening up his spine. “Is the Mudblood so boring you must bother -“

“Why the /hell/ did you waste food!?” Potter spat fingers twitching for his wand though he didn't pull it out. The question was so startling that Draco merely gaped at Potter silently. “Well?! You think just because your rich means you can waste food? There are people going hungry every day and you think, ‘mmm I'm just going to take one bite out of this apple and throw it away'!”

“What?” Draco managed blinking in an uncultured way.

“What?! What? Oh you aren't getting out of this! If I see you wasting food one more time I'm going to hex you!” Harry spun around and began marching off, Hermione and Ron appearing right as he did so, both looking worried.

“Hey Potter!” Harry spun around to glare. “Why were you watching me eat?”

Potter left red faced without answering.

** This is just a small part of the fic, but I loved this scene from a fic where Harry was made prefect instead of Ron:

#+begin_quote
  "Harry! Being a prefect is a privilege."

  "They just tell you that so you'll be excited about being a glorified hall monitor." Harry told her seriously. A slight commotion further down the table drew their attention. Several of the second years were flinging spoonfuls of oatmeal at one another.

  "/OI! Knock it off. You should all be ashamed. There are children starving in Africa who would be thrilled to have oatmeal, and here you are wasting it. Hang your heads in shame./" The kids all looked at Harry like he was insane.

  "Do I have to come down there? HANG YOUR HEADS IN SHAME."

  The kids looked at one another uncertainly and hung their heads. Harry nodded in satisfaction and went back to eating.

  A few minutes later Lavender nudged him.

  "Harry? The kiddies want to know how long they need to do that for."

  "Huh? Are you sufficiently shamed? Carry on then."

  "Harry, honestly." Hermione sighed.

  "What? Works, doesn't it?"

Harry was panting and running as fast as his legs could carry him. Riddle was shooting hex after hex after hex- faster than he thought anyone could duel. “Tired yet, Potter?” Riddle sneered. He conjured up a mist and transfigured it into a mist apple, took a bite, and threw it onto the ground, where it strangely kept it's shape. Harry stopped in his tracks, gasping for air. “WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR?!” “Do what?” Riddle stopped casting, a confused look on his handsome face. “Duh, WASTING FOOD!” “What food?” “THAT APPLE TOM!” Riddle picked up the apple on the ground. “This thing? It isn't even food!” “YES IT IS AND EAT IT!” “No.” Riddle looked into Harry's stunned face and promptly killed him on the spot. Note: I do t have any talent for writing and this is very OOC and not-understandable. This is just for fun.
